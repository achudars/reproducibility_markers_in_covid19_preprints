Abstract

42

Background: Many California nail salon workers are low-income Vietnamese women of

43

reproductive age who use nail products daily that contain androgen-disrupting phthalates which

44

may increase risk of male reproductive tract abnormalities during pregnancy. Yet, few studies

45

have characterized phthalate exposures among this workforce. Objective: To characterize

46

individual metabolites and cumulative phthalates exposure among a potentially vulnerable

47

occupational group of nail salon workers. Study Design: We collected 17 post-shift urine

48

samples from Vietnamese workers at six San Francisco Bay Area nail salons in 2011, which

49

were analyzed for four primary phthalate metabolites: mono-n-butyl-, mono-isobutyl-, mono(2-

50

ethylhexyl)-, and monoethyl phthalates (MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP, respectively) (μg/L).

51

Phthalate metabolite concentrations and a potency-weighted sum of parent compound daily

52

intake (Σandrogen-disruptor, μg/kg/day) were compared to 203 Asian Americans from the 2011–

53

12 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) using Student’s t-test and

54

Wilcoxin signed rank test. Results: Creatinine-corrected MnBP, MiBP, MEHP (μg/g), and

55

cumulative phthalates exposure (Σandrogen-disruptor, μg/kg/day) levels were 2.9 (p < 0.0001),

56

1.6 (p = 0.015), 2.6 (p < 0.0001), and 2.0 (p < 0.0001) times higher, respectively, in our nail

57

salon worker population compared to NHANES Asian Americans. Levels exceeded the

58

NHANES 95th or 75th percentiles among some workers. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests

59

that nail salon workers are disproportionately exposed to multiple phthalates, a finding that

60

warrants further investigation to assess their potential health significance.

Introduction

65

Recent statements by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and

66

other leading medical societies have called for timely action on reducing chemical exposures that

67

contribute to developmental harm and reproductive health inequities among underserved

68

populations.1,2 As suggested in a commentary on the environmental injustice of the beauty care

69

industry, eliminating harmful compounds in personal care products may provide opportunities

70

for achieving this goal.3 Indeed, many beauty industry workers are low wage immigrant women

71

of reproductive age, a population highlighted by ACOG as uniquely vulnerable due to their

72

disproportionate environmental exposures and social stressors at and outside of work.1

73

The U.S. nail care industry has expanded rapidly over the last few decades, with active

74

nail technician licenses totaling over 400,000 in 20154 and recent nationwide spending up to $8.5

75

billion and $768 million on nail care services and nail polish alone.5 Just over half of U.S. nail

76

salon workers are Vietnamese, most of whom are women of reproductive age.4,6,7 California has

77

the largest number of manicurists and salons in the country,4,7 in part due to a rise in Vietnamese

78

immigration between 1987 and 2002, which increased the proportion of Vietnamese nail salon

79

workers from 10% to 60%.8,9

80

Because many nail salon workers are low income women of color with limited English

81

proficiency and access to chemical health and safety information, the California Healthy Nail

82

Salon Collaborative and National Healthy Nail Salon Alliance formed in recent years to

83

safeguard occupational health while maintaining economic integrity among this workforce.10–13

84

Diverse coalition members include workers, owners, researchers, advocates, and government

85

agency officials who contribute to local and national initiatives on chemical exposure research,

86

worker health and safety trainings, green salon certification programs, and efforts to increase

cosmetic product labeling requirements.13,14 As part of this effort, California’s Department of

88

Toxic Substances and Control (DTSC) revealed the presence of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), toluene,

89

and formaldehyde in nail care products claiming to be free of “toxic trio” ingredients, and has

90

since proposed nail salon products as a target category for alternatives assessment in the coming

91

years.15–17 Characterizing occupational exposures among this workforce can thus inform

92

practical workplace intervention strategies and upstream efforts to promote safer products.

93

Phthalates are priority chemicals of concern because they are reproductive toxicants

94

commonly used in nail care products and other cosmetics, for example, to increase flexibility and

95

prevent nail polish from chipping or to sustain fragrances in scented lotions.17,18 They are anti-

96

androgenic compounds associated with multiple hormone mediated health impacts across the life

97

course, including pregnancy complications, neurodevelopmental effects, cancer, and metabolic

98

disease.19–22 Moreover, in a groundbreaking 2008 report entitled, Phthalates and Cumulative

99

Risk Assessment: The Tasks Ahead, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended

100

evaluating phthalates in combination because their joint effects may increase risk of impaired

101

male reproductive tract development during pregnancy.23

102

Although two prior studies measured phthalate levels among U.S. nail salon workers,

103

they were not designed to characterize exposures among Vietnamese or Asian workers

104

specifically.24,25 Study populations were either predominantly white (40% Asian)25 or did not

105

distinguish racial/ethnic differences (i.e., country of origin) among Asian study participants.24

106

Additionally, worker levels were compared to the entire general population rather than a

107

nationally representative sample of Asian Americans. Accordingly, the goals of this pilot

108

biomonitoring study are to build on prior research and for the first time characterize phthalate

109

exposures in an exclusive sample of Vietnamese nail salon workers compared to Asian

Americans in the general population during an overlapping time period. Our study is also the

111

first to characterize potency-weighted cumulative phthalates exposure (as recommended in the

112

2008 NAS report) among a uniquely exposed and potentially vulnerable workforce to

113

reproductive toxicants.23

Study population and sample collection

117

Our study population comprised a subset of participants sampled in a 2011 pilot intervention

118

study designed to educate nail salon workers and owners about how to reduce occupational

119

exposures to various hazardous chemicals.26 That study included 26 Vietnamese American

120

workers at eight San Francisco Bay Area nail salons and measured each worker’s personal

121

breathing zone air for volatile organic compounds such as toluene and methyl methacrylate.

122

During air monitoring sessions, each participant completed questionnaires on characteristics such

123

as age, the number of other workers and customers on the day of sampling, types of nail care

124

services performed, and individual protective behaviors. Prior to educating workers about how to

125

reduce their exposures, post-shift urine samples were collected from 17 of these workers at six

126

nail salons during busier days of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) and warmer months

127

of the year (June and July). Written consent was obtained in Vietnamese, and human subjects

128

institutional review and approval from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California was received

129

on May 11, 2011 (Protocol # 2010-013). Urine samples were collected in four-ounce glass

130

containers, shipped on ice, and stored at -20 oC prior to analysis. To reduce potential effects of

131

freeze-thaw cycles, samples were thawed and aliquoted (2–4 mL) in pre-cleaned amber vials.

132

Water laboratory blanks were also prepared in the same type vials and frozen.

Laboratory analysis

134

All urinary phthalate analyses were conducted at the Department of Toxic Substances Control

135

(DTSC) in Berkeley, California. We measured four phthalate metabolites in this pilot study

136

because our modest pilot study budget warranted a targeted approach to analyte selection, and

137

our collaborators at DTSC sought to develop methods to measure urinary analytes for priority

138

chemicals that would inform DTSC’s Safer Consumer Products program. We selected analytes

139

based on earlier studies which suggested that mono-n-butyl-, mono-isobutyl-, mono(2-

140

ethylhexyl)-, and monoethyl phthalates (MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP, respectively) may be

141

associated with working in a nail salon.24,25 To analyze urine samples in the lab, we adapted and

142

validated the Silva et al. (2004) method used by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to

143

measure urinary MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP concentrations using liquid chromatography-

144

tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).27 Isotopically-labeled internal standards (IS) were used

145

for quantitation (MnBP IS was used for MiBP) and Agilent Nexus ABS Bond Elut cartridges for

146

solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up. Samples were analyzed using a Varian 320MS LC-

147

MS/MS with a Phenomenex Gemini C6-Phenyl column (100mm x 2.00mm, 3µm). Baseline

148

peak resolution was achieved for all metabolites, and no significant laboratory background was

149

detected. Relative recoveries of quality control standards spiked into the urine before SPE ranged

150

between 80–95%. Inter- and intra-day reproducibility and precision (coefficient of variation <

151

15%) were demonstrated in addition to accuracy (< 15% difference between expected and

152

observed concentrations). The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the lowest calibration

153

standard providing a signal-to-noise ratio > 6. Once the method was validated, all 17 nail salon

154

worker urine samples were analyzed and aliquots were submitted to the clinical laboratory at San

155

Francisco General Hospital for creatinine measurements.

Statistical analysis

157

Nail salon worker data were compared to 2011–12 CDC-administered National Health and

158

Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative questionnaire and

159

physical survey of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population. As part of the NHANES

160

medical examination, spot urine samples are collected and shipped on dry ice to CDC’s National

161

Center for Environmental Health for analysis.28 Demographic and laboratory files were

162

downloaded from the NHANES website in May 2015 (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).

163

Out of 9756 NHANES participants, 2489 were sampled for >10 urinary phthalate metabolites,

164

quantified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass

165

spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).29 Primary comparison populations were restricted to pooled (men

166

and women) and female-only NHANES Asian Americans 20–59 years old (n = 203 and n = 97,

167

respectively). A secondary comparison population included all NHANES participants aged 20–

168

59 years (N = 1175).

169

The nail salon urine sample and NHANES data were analyzed using SAS software,

170

Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Phthalate metabolite concentrations below the

171

LOD were imputed with LOD divided by √2. To correct for urine dilution, metabolite

172

concentration (μg/L) was divided by urinary creatinine concentration (g/L), which is often used

173

as a surrogate for urine dilution.30,31 A potency weighted cumulative sum of phthalates daily

174

intake (Σandrogen-disruptor, μg/kg/day) was constructed as described elsewhere.32,33 Briefly,

175

daily intakes of DnBP, DiBP, DEHP, and DEP were weighted by relative potency factors and

176

summed using the following equation: Σandrogen-disruptor = (DnBP x 1.0) + (DiBP x 0.24) +

177

(DEHP x 0.61) + (DEP x 0.024). Daily intake for each phthalate was back-calculated from

178

creatinine-corrected urinary metabolite concentrations (μg/g) using creatinine excretion rates and

179

fractional excretion values of metabolites relative to parent compounds. Because MEHP was the

180

only DEHP metabolite included in this analysis, an FUE value of 0.062 was used for DEHP

181

estimation.34 Average creatinine excretion rates of 23 mg/kg/day and 18 mg/kg/day were applied

182

to men and women, respectively.35 Concentrations of Σandrogen-disruptor and urinary

183

metabolites were log-transformed prior to statistical testing to account for non-normal

184

distributions, and statistical and marginal significance were defined at p < 0.05 and p < 0.10 for

185

two-sided tests, respectively.

186

Descriptive statistics were calculated for worker and salon characteristics, such as

187

average hours worked per week, number of services performed on the day of sampling, and salon

188

volume in cubic meters of air (m3). We calculated detection frequencies (% > LOD) of measured

189

urinary metabolites and performed univariate statistics on creatinine-corrected concentrations,

190

non-creatinine-corrected concentrations, and our cumulative exposure metric (Σandrogen-

191

disruptor). Univariate statistics included the arithmetic mean, geometric mean (GM), geometric

192

standard deviation (GSD) or geometric standard error (GSE), range, and 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th

193

percentiles, and were calculated for all 17 nail salon workers and female-only workers (n = 15).

194

These were also calculated for NHANES comparison populations, accounting for sample

195

population weights and the complex NHANES survey design according to analytical

196

guidelines.28

197

Phthalate concentrations were compared between nail salon workers and NHANES

198

2011–12 participants using a parametric t-test for MnBP, MEHP, MEP, and the cumulative

199

exposure metric (Σandrogen-disruptor). For statistical hypothesis testing, NHANES values were

200

assumed to be the true population values. The Wilcoxon signed rank non-parametric t-test was

201

used for the MiBP comparison, since several MiBP outliers were observed among nail salon

202

workers. This analysis was performed separately for pooled (men and women) and female-only

203

Asian Americans aged 20–59 years old, in addition to all race/ethnicities of the same age range.

204

Because urine dilution correction and daily intake estimation may both introduce

205

uncertainty and variability into back-calculated biological exposure metrics,30,31,36,37 we

206

conducted a supplementary analysis to evaluate whether alternate approaches impacted results.

207

Two additional cumulative exposure metrics were calculated by first applying RPF weights

208

directly to non-creatinine-corrected concentrations measured in urine (μg/L), and then by

209

applying RPF weights to creatinine-corrected urinary metabolite concentrations (μg/g).32

210

Compared to the original metric (Σandrogen-disruptor), which both corrected for urine dilution

211

and estimated daily intake, the first supplementary metric provided a comparison to an absence

212

of both potential sources of uncertainty/variability, while the second provided a comparison to

213

the absence of daily intake estimation only.

214

To facilitate interpretation of results, we additionally compiled a summary of urinary

215

phthalate metabolite concentrations measured in relevant biomonitoring and health impact

216

studies. These included two previous biomonitoring studies that reported creatinine-corrected

217

values, one that collected 25 post-shift urine samples from predominantly Asian nail salon

218

workers in Maryland, USA,24 and another that collected 30 urine samples exclusively from the

219

general population in Vietnam.38 One other known study measured urinary MnBP and MiBP in

220

U.S. nail salon workers, but the study population was predominantly white and specific gravity-

221

corrected concentrations were the only values reported, which limited comparability with our

222

results.25 Lastly, we included five epidemiology studies that reported significant associations

223

between non-corrected concentrations of urinary metabolites measured in this study and adverse

male developmental outcomes,39–43 excluding studies that reported specific-gravity corrected

225

values only, as they were not directly comparable.

226
227

Results

228

All 17 nail salon workers were born in Vietnam and most preferred to speak Vietnamese at home

229

(Table 1). The average age of the study population was 40 years. There was a wide range of

230

hours worked per week at the salon (10 to 60 hours), with a mean of 34.5 hours per week, and

231

number of services performed on the day of sampling (1 to 17 services), with an average of 8

232

services. The average number of other workers in the salon on the day of sampling was 4 and

233

ranged from 2 to 8. The estimated number of total salon customers on the day of sampling was

234

around 22, with a range between 7 and 40. Most workers reported using gloves and a metal trash

235

bin. The most popular ventilation practice was leaving the doors of the salon open.

236

Detection frequencies for urinary phthalate metabolites were similar or higher in nail

237

salon workers (93–100%) compared to NHANES Asian Americans (80–100%) (Tables 2 and 3).

238

In all workers (n = 17), MEP had the highest creatinine-corrected GM of 38 μg/g (GSD = 3.3,

239

range = 8.1–497 μg/g), followed by 23 μg/g for MnBP (1.7, 9.9–61 μg/g), 13 for MiBP (2.3, 3.6–

240

121 μg/g), and 5.9 for MEHP (1.8, 2.2–16 μg/g) (Table 2). The same rank order was observed

241

among female-only workers and NHANES Asian Americans (pooled and female participants)

242

(Tables 2 and 3), as well as for non-creatinine-corrected values (Table 4).

243

Creatinine-corrected phthalate metabolite concentrations were higher among nail salon

244

workers compared to NHANES Asian Americans, and some of the differences were statistically

245

significant (Table 2). MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP were 186% (p < 0.0001), 66% (p =

246

0.015), 158% (p < 0.0001), and 25% (p = 0.445) higher, respectively. For some nail salon

247

workers, creatinine-corrected metabolite concentrations exceeded the NHANES 95th percentile

248

in adult Asian Americans. The highest worker concentrations were 44%, 293%, 20%, and 40%

249

above the NHANES 95th percentile for MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP, respectively.

250

Additionally, two nail salon workers had more than one urinary metabolite concentration greater

251

than the NHANES 95th percentile (Table 2). Female nail salon workers had similar but

252

attenuated results, with 132% (p < 0.0001), 46% (p = 0.041), 120% (p = 0.0002), and 27% (p =

253

0.455) higher MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP concentrations, respectively, compared to

254

NHANES Asian American females (Table 3).

255

Non-creatinine-corrected results for pooled (men and women) and female participants

256

were also similar and/or slightly attenuated, though MiBP was not significantly higher in pooled

257

nail care workers compared to NHANES Asian Americans, and only marginally significant

258

when the analysis was restricted to female participants (Table 4). Because urinary concentrations

259

among all NHANES race/ethnicities (N = 1175) were lower than those measured in NHANES

260

Asian Americans for each phthalate metabolite except MEP, this study population was not

261

included in further analyses.

262

Among pooled study populations (men and women), the GM of cumulative phthalates

263

daily intake (Σandrogen-disruptor) was 97% higher in nail salon workers (GM = 2.6; GSD = 1.7

264

µg/kg/day) compared to NHANES (GM = 1.3; GSE = 1.1 µg/kg/day) (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1).

265

Among women, the percent difference between workers and NHANES Asian Americans was

266

81% (p = 0.0004). However, the maximum NHANES cumulative exposure of 39 µg/kg/day was

267

over five times greater than the maximum nail salon worker cumulative exposure of 6.7

268

µg/kg/day. The Σandrogen-disruptor distributions for pooled and female-only NHANES Asian

269

270

extreme cumulative exposure concentrations belonged to women. Thus, the NHANES 95th

271

percentile for women (8.5 µg/kg/day) was substantially higher than the pooled NHANES 95th

272

percentile (5.2 µg/kg/day). None of the nail salon workers exceeded the female-only NHANES

273

95th percentile, but two nail salon workers (both women) exceeded the pooled NHANES 95th

274

percentile. Twelve workers (70%), including both men, were above the NHANES 75th percentile

275

for female-only and pooled Asian Americans (Figure 1).

276

The supplementary analysis exploring alternate cumulative exposure metrics (i.e.,

277

alternate approaches to urine dilution correction and daily intake estimation) produced similar

278

results between supplementary cumulative exposure metrics and our original cumulative

279

exposure metric (Σandrogen-disruptor). This indicates that differences in cumulative phthalates

280

exposure between nail salon workers and the Asian American general population did not depend

281

on whether or not urine dilution corrections or parent compound back-calculations were applied

282

to phthalate metabolite concentrations measured in urine. We thus reported results solely for the

283

original cumulative phthalates exposure metric (Σandrogen-disruptor).

284

All creatinine-corrected urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations measured among nail

285

salon workers in this study were similar to or higher than concentrations reported in a previous

286

biomonitoring study of the general population in Vietnam (Table 5).38 However, lower

287

creatinine-corrected urinary concentrations were observed in this study compared to nail salon

288

workers sampled in 2003–4, except for MiBP which was twice as high in our nail salon worker

289

population.24 Besides MEP, non-creatinine corrected metabolite concentrations in this study were

290

similar to or higher than those measured in epidemiology studies that reported a significant

291

association with adverse male developmental endpoints, such as decreased anogenital distance

292

(AGD), reductions in penile length, and reduced masculine play among boys (Table 6).39–42

Comment
This pilot study of 17 nail salon workers provides evidence of elevated individual

296

metabolite and cumulative phthalates exposure in comparison to a national sample of the U.S.

297

Asian American population. Specifically, nail salon workers had significantly higher levels of

298

MnBP, MiBP, and MEHP, as well as higher levels of exposure to multiple phthalates that were

299

combined in a summary metric based on their relative toxicities (Σandrogen-disruptor). To our

300

knowledge, this is the first biomonitoring assessment of phthalates in an exclusive sample of

301

Vietnamese nail salon workers in California, who comprise a uniquely vulnerable occupational

302

group. This pilot study suggests that nail salon workers are exposed to higher levels of

303

biologically relevant phthalate combinations than the general population.

304

Individual metabolite concentrations exceeded the NHANES 95th percentile in several

305

nail salon workers, and for more than one metabolite in two participants, indicating that some

306

workers may be simultaneously exposed to phthalate combinations at very high levels relative to

307

the general Asian American population. Most nail salon workers had higher cumulative

308

phthalates daily intake than the NHANES 75th but not 95th percentiles. However, the NHANES

309

Asian American comparison population conceivably might include Vietnamese nail salon

310

workers, which could have skewed the distribution (and 95th percentile) towards the upper end of

311

extreme values. Due to existing evidence that combined phthalate exposures may have greater

312

adverse health effects than individual phthalate exposures, future studies in a larger sample of

313

nail salon workers could examine whether these pilot findings can be replicated.23,44–46

314

While this analysis did not assess direct connections between phthalates and health

315

impacts, MnBP, MiBP, and MEHP concentrations were similar to or above those measured in

316

studies reporting adverse developmental endpoints in male offspring.39–42,44 For example, in a

317

large prospective cohort study across four major U.S. cities (N = 753) that found a significant

318

association between MEHP and reduced anogenital distance among baby boys, Swan et al.

319

(2015) reported a non-creatinine corrected GM of 1.9 ng/mL (95% CI: 1.8, 2.1), which was >1.5

320

times lower than the GM of 3.5 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.4, 5.3) observed among female nail salon

321

workers in this study.40 These exposure levels are of potential concern for women in the nail

322

salon workforce who are of reproductive age and may become pregnant.

323

MnBP, MEHP, and MEP concentrations measured in this study were lower than those

324

collected seven years prior, reflecting U.S. biomonitoring trends for these metabolites between

325

2001 and 2012.24 Similarly, MiBP concentrations were two times higher in the current nail salon

326

worker population, which is consistent with a reported >100% increase in urinary MiBP levels

327

over the last decade.47 These temporal changes may reflect product reformulations in response to

328

increased phthalates scrutiny and consumer preferences for safer alternatives over the last

329

decade.47–49 Due to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) limited oversight over

330

cosmetic ingredients, large public campaigns in recent years have pressured beauty companies,

331

such as OPI, Sally Hansen, and Revlon, to remove phthalates from nail polish and other personal

332

care products.50 Subsequent data suggest that DiBP may be replacing the better-known DnBP,

333

which has long been used as a hardener in nail polish to preserve shape and color.47,48,51–53

334

However, DnBP is still detected in many nail care products, including those claiming to be

335

phthalate free,15,17 and both compounds contribute to androgen-mediated risks associated with

336

phthalate co-exposures.23,54 Continued product testing and biomonitoring research will be

337

required to evaluate these trends going forward.

338
339

While absolute levels have changed over time, the difference between nail salon workers
and the general population remained relatively constant between the previous study (which

compared samples collected from workers in 2003–4 to NHANES 2001–2)24 and our study

341

(which compared samples collected from workers in 2011 to NHANES 2011–12). Both studies

342

found higher MnBP and MiBP concentrations among nail salon workers, which is consistent

343

with common use of their parent compounds in nail and other beauty products.25,47 MEP levels

344

were substantially but not significantly higher among nail salon workers in both studies.

345

Although typically associated with personal care product use in non-occupational

346

populations,18,19,25,55 MEP exposures at the nail salon may be negligible relative to high

347

background concentrations measured in the general population. Indeed, MEP levels were the

348

highest observed in our study as well as previous studies assessing this compound in the U.S.

349

population.32,47

350

Our MEHP results are also consistent with prior research which found the highest MEHP

351

concentrations among nail salon workers,24 despite DEHP’s prevalent association with dietary

352

intake from food packaging and processing equipment, rather than from cosmetic or beauty

353

product use.44 Levels were nearly five times that of U.S. adults and higher than every other

354

occupational group evaluated (including phthalate and PVC manufacturing workers).24 Oxidative

355

(secondary) metabolites of DEHP were not significantly elevated in nail salon workers, which

356

suggested the possibility of an unknown DEHP source that may be unique to nail salons. We

357

speculate that acrylic nail powder may be a possible unique MEHP exposure source in this

358

workforce, as it contains a catalyst that metabolizes to benzoic acid.56,57 Given that MEHP is an

359

ester derivative of benzoic acid, acrylic nail powder may conceivably be a direct source of

360

MEHP exposure in nail salons, which would explain why higher primary but not secondary

361

metabolites (which can only be formed in the liver) were observed previously. However, a major

362

limitation of our study is that we did not measure oxidative metabolites for DEHP, which

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011452; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

16

363

constitute a larger fraction of absorbed parent compound dose than MEHP. Consequently,

364

measuring MEHP alone might underestimate DEHP daily intake. Additionally, oxidative

365

metabolites are less sensitive than primary monoesters to laboratory contamination because they

366

are formed solely from phthalate metabolism in the liver.58 Future biomonitoring studies that

367

evaluate DEHP should include at least one oxidized metabolite.

368

Other study limitations should be addressed in future work. First, our sample size was too

369

small to predict phthalate metabolite and cumulative exposure concentrations from questionnaire

370

data on worker and salon characteristics, thus limiting statistical power to identify specific

371

occupational sources of phthalates exposure. Forthcoming research on nail salon exposures

372

should also include the collection of pre-shift urine samples in addition to air samples collected

373

during the shift, which would help differentiate between occupational and non-occupational

374

(environmental) exposures. The addition of pre-shift urine samples may be the best way to assess

375

phthalate exposures in nail salon workers, given the short metabolic half-lives of phthalates (less

376

than 24 hours).26 Including questionnaire data about non-occupational exposure sources, such as

377

at-home personal care product use and dietary behaviors, would also facilitate delineation

378

between occupational and environmental exposures. Additionally, while prior research has

379

demonstrated moderate long-term reliability of urine spot samples in adults for some

380

metabolites, including MEP and MnBP, studies evaluating reproducibility in other populations

381

are somewhat equivocal.59–61 Furthermore, intra-person variability may be higher in the

382

workplace due to short-term exposure spikes from specific job tasks.26 Longitudinal data

383

collection could help resolve this issue in future studies.

384

Lastly, although nail salon workers in this study were compared to NHANES Asian

385

Americans of the same age range sampled within a year of workers in this study, some non-

17

386

occupational differences between the groups could potentially explain exposure disparities. For

387

example, workers in this study were Vietnamese-born, while the NHANES Asian American

388

population may include second or third generation immigrants. Vietnamese immigrants might

389

use different personal care products or eat different foods than those born in the United States,

390

which could result in observed exposure disparities between workers and the NHANES sample

391

that are not occupationally based. However, Guo et al. (2011) biomonitored 30 people in

392

Vietnam and reported equal or lower creatinine-corrected phthalate metabolite levels than

393

workers in this study,38 suggesting our findings are not likely to due to cultural differences in

394

personal care product use or diet originating from the country of origin. Other differences

395

between the groups, such as location, sampling strategy (convenience rather than multistage

396

probability), data collection time of day (post-shift compared to random), and month or season of

397

sampling (summer rather than throughout the year), might also partially explain exposure

398

differences.

399

Despite limitations, findings from this pilot study suggest that nail salon workers are

400

disproportionately exposed to multiple phthalates daily at levels associated with adverse effects

401

on reproductive health and development. Comparing Vietnamese nail salon workers to a national

402

sample of Asian Americans provides useful insight and supportive evidence that higher

403

concentrations of individual metabolites and potency weighted cumulative phthalates levels may

404

be due to workplace exposures. Further research should more broadly characterize phthalate

405

exposures and their health implications in this workforce. Continued efforts should be made to

406

identify workplace practices that minimize exposure (i.e., ventilation and glove use) as well as

407

upstream opportunities for promoting safer alternatives.
