Abstract
HIV set-point viral load (SPVL) is an important predictor of HIV progression and transmission. Although it
has been reported that anti-retroviral therapy (ART) reduces viral load (VL), increased SPVL levels have
been observed in MSM in the decade following the introduction of ART in the Netherlands. Several studies
have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in SPVL. However, to our knowledge, none of
these studies has investigated an explanation in which it arises as the result of a sexually transmitted
infection (STI) co-factor in detail.
In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate how STI co-infection and
sexual risk behaviour affect the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM before and after the introduction of ART.
The results suggest that both STI co-factors and sexual risk behaviour have an effect on SPVL. However,
the observed trends in SPVL cannot be explained by sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factors only.
We recommend to develop mathematical models including also factors related to viral evolution as
reported earlier in the literature. However, this requires more complex models, and the collection of more
data for parameter estimation than what is currently available.

Introduction

1

HIV viral load (HIV RNA concentration in plasma) is an important and widely used prognostic marker for
HIV progression and transmission [18, 19, 25]. While immediately after infection rapid HIV replication and
high HIV viral load (VL) values are observed, VL declines during the asymptomatic phase and reaches a
stable level, called set-point viral load (SPVL) after a few weeks to a few months [9]. Although it has been
reported that anti-retroviral therapy (ART) reduces HIV transmission by decreasing VL [20, 23], increased
SPVL levels were observed in MSM in the Netherlands during the period 1995-2007, after the introduction of
ART in 1994 [14]. Moreover, in Belgium, where ART was also introduced in the mid-1990s [22], an increase
in HIV incidence in MSM has been observed during the period 1997-2013. After 2013, a drop in new HIV
diagnoses has been observed [27].

Several studies have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in HIV SPVL after the
introduction of ART. The majority of these studies try to explain these trends from an evolutionary
perspective. They explain the observed trends by host genetic factors [33, 35], viral adaptation of HIV to its
host population [3, 6, 10, 28] and evolution of HIV SPVL to maintain higher viral fitness [8, 13, 29, 32]. A few
studies have investigated sexual risk behaviour as a potential factor influencing SPVL [1, 12]. A recent study
of Goodreau et al. [12] reports a positive relationship between relational concurrency and mean SPVL.
Mathematical modeling has been shown to be a valuable tool to investigate the evolution of SPVL and HIV
virulence. Bezemer et al. [1] used a deterministic compartmental ODE model to study the influence of sexual
risk behaviour on the HIV epidemic. Herbeck et al. [17] used an individual-based model to investigate trends
in HIV virulence and community viral load. Their model contained functions for transmission and
progression of HIV, SPVL, VL at multiple stages of HIV and SPVL heritability. Sexual relationships were
described by a simplified contact network, without including sexual mixing patterns. Roberts et al. [24]
designed a deterministic model to assess the impact of ART on viral evolution. Smith et al. [30] developed a
compartmental model to study the influence of ART and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on the evolution
of HIV virulence. Goodreau et al. [12] used an individual- and network-based model to study the relationship
between relational concurrency, HIV stages and evolution of HIV SPVL. However, none of these models
implemented the effect of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor whereas the presence of an STI
co-factor has been suggested to influence the trend in SPVL [14].
In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate the effect of sexual risk
behaviour, STI co-infection and their combined effect on the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM after the
introduction of ART. The paper is organized as follows. In the Materials and Methods section, we describe
the individual-based model, the parameter estimation procedure and the scenarios considered. In the Results
section, the results for the different scenarios are presented and compared. In the Discussion section, we
discuss our main findings and formulate recommendations for future research.

Simpact Cyan 1.0 modeling framework

36

Simpact Cyan 1.0 is a open-source framework for constructing individual-based models for simulating the
transmission, diagnosis and treatment of HIV [21]. The program models each individual in a heterosexual or
homosexual population, and the sexual relationships between individuals. The formation and dissolution of
relationships, as well as birth, mortality, HIV transmission, diagnosis and treatment are represented by
events, which have a certain risk of taking place at a certain moment, represented by their hazard function.
Models are implemented in continuous time and updated each time an event happens. Simpact Cyan 1.0 also
implements a generic sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor effect on HIV. Furthermore, it’s also
possible to simulate interventions by changing certain parameters during the simulation.
More detailed information on the Simpact Cyan 1.0 modeling framework is available in [21] and from
http://www.simpact.org/.

In this study, we focus on the influence of sexual risk behaviour and STI co-infection dynamics on the
evolution of the HIV set point viral load (SPVL) in MSM. Simulations are conducted for the period from
1980 to 2015, including both the period before and after the introduction of ART in 1994. After the
introduction of ART, it is also assumed that the CD4 count threshold below which ART is offered
increased [7], so that more people are treated. Furthermore, we assume that availability of ART has led to
intensified HIV testing [11].
Four model scenarios including ART coverage, corresponding to four different hypotheses for explaining
the rise in SPVL between 1995 and 2007, are considered:
• no STI co-factor effect and no change in risk behaviour: the observed trends are caused by other
factors;

• STI co-factor effect and no change in risk behaviour: the observed trends are caused by an increased
STI co-factor effect;
• a change in risk behaviour and no STI co-factor effect: the observed trends are caused by an increase in
sexual risk behaviour;
• a change in risk behaviour and an STI co-factor effect: the observed trends are caused by a

For the nine parameters in Table 2, there were no literature values available. Therefore, these parameters
were fitted to the data in Table 1 by applying an active learning approach [34] using the following steps:
1. Select 10,000 parameter sets by applying Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) [31] and using the initial
parameter ranges from Table 2.

73

2. For each of the 10,000 parameter sets, run a simulation with Simpact Cyan 1.0.

74

3. For each simulation, calculate the goodness-of-fit (GOF) based on the sum of squared relative errors [2].

75

4. Apply the selection procedure of Castro Sanchez et al [26] based on the GOF measure to narrow the
solution space (intervals for the parameters).
5. Repeat steps 1-4 using the new intervals for the parameters until the GOF does not improve anymore.

Goodness-of-fit

Figure 1 (left) shows that including an STI co-factor effect or/and a behavioural change results in a
considerably better goodness-of-fit (GOF). The model including only an STI co-factor shows the best GOF,
followed by the model including both an STI co-factor and behavioural changes (see Figure 1 (right)). For the
remainder of the paper, we only discuss the models including an STI co-factor and/or behavioural changes.

Figure 4 shows that none of the scenarios including an STI and/or increased risk behaviour explains the
increasing trend in HIV SPVL between 1995 and 2007 described by Gras et al [14]. However, for the scenario
including both an STI co-factor and increased risk behaviour (STI-BC), only a slight decrease in SPVL
between 1995 and 2007 is observed, while the other two scenarios show a larger decline. This suggests that
both STI co-factor effects and behavioural changes contribute to the reduction of the beneficial effects of
ART on the spread of HIV.

Discussion

110

After the introduction of ART, increasing trends in HIV SPVL and HIV incidence were observed in
MSM [14, 27], which are counter-intuitive and not fully understood. In this study, we used an event- and
individual-based model to investigate the impact of STI co-infection, changes in sexual risk behaviour and a
combination of both on the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM. The results show a considerable improved fit of
the model to literature data when including an STI co-factor and/or behavioural changes, which suggests
that both sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factor effects influence HIV SPVL. Furthermore, the model
including only an STI co-factor and no behavioural change provides the best fit. However, the HIV
prevalence curves are closer to the observed values in [5] when also including behavioural changes. For the
ART coverage, the scenario including only behavioural changes and no STI co-factor results in the closest
approximation to the reported value in [15].
Although none of the three scenarios including an STI co-factor and/or behavioural changes could explain
the increasing trend in SPVL reported in Gras et al. [14], all scenarios can explain the increase in new HIV
cases between 1995 and 2013. Moreover, only the scenario with an STI co-factor and no behavioural changes
could also explain the drop HIV incidence after 2013 reported in [27]. Only the scenarios that include an STI
co-factor or behavioural changes (but not both) could confirm the higher mean SPVL with higher relational
concurrency reported by Goodreau et al [12].
There are several potential reasons that none of the scenarios can explain the trends in SPVL reported in
Gras et al. [14]. First, apart from treatment, sexual behaviour and STI co-factor effects, also factors related
to viral evolution were reported to have an effect on the evolution of SPVL. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no modeling framework is available that can incorporate treatment, sexual risk behaviour, STI
co-infection and viral evolution into a single model. This will be explored in future research. Second, the

available data for this case study as reported in the literature is scarce. Making more data available will lead
to better estimation of the model parameters, and possibly to improved models that can better explain the
trends in SPVL observed in the literature. Furthermore, the data on SPVL from [14] (see Table 1) for 1995
are based on a considerably lower amount of persons than for 1985 and 2007, which creates uncertainty
about the observed trends. According to Cumming and Finch [4], methods for significance testing based on
confidence intervals (CI) are reliable when both sample sizes are equal or larger than 10, and when the
margins of error differ not more than a factor 2. For 1995 the first condition is not fulfilled. This means that
although a proportion overlap of 0.387 between the CIs for 1985 and 1995 is obtained, pointing to a
significant difference between the two samples according to Cumming and Finch [4], there is uncertainty
about the observed decrease between these two time points. Third, only a generic STI co-factor effect was
included in the model. Including a more specific STI co-factor effect, e.g. a herpes simplex virus (HSV-2)
co-factor effect where all stages of HSV-2 are described in detail may lead to improved models for this case
study. However, such model has many more parameters than the model used in this study, and as a
consequence requires more data than currently available for parameter estimation.
In summary, the results of this study suggest that both STI co-factors and sexual risk behaviour could
influence SPVL, but cannot explain the trends described in the literature. Future research to understand
SPVL evolution should also consider models that include factors related to viral evolution and describe STI
co-factors in more detail. To accomplish these goals, more data has to be collected and made available.
