Abstract
Objectives
To explore the efficacy of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in predicting under-five
mortality in LMICs and to identify significant predictors of under-five mortality (U5M).
Design
This is a cross-sectional, proof-of-concept study.
Settings and participants
We analysed data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The data was drawn
from 21 Low-and-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) countries (N = 1,048,575). Eligible
mothers in each household were asked information about their children and the reproductive
care they received during the pregnancy.
Primary and secondary outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was under-five mortality; secondary outcome was comparing
the efficacy of deep learning algorithms: Deep Neural Network (DNN); Convolution Neural
Network (CNN); Hybrid CNN-DNN with Logistic Regression (LR) for the prediction of
child survival.
Results
We found that duration of breast feeding, household wealth index and the level of maternal
education are the most important predictors of under-five mortality. We found that deep
learning techniques are superior to LR for the classification of child survival: LR sensitivity =
0.47, specificity = 0.53; DNN sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.83; CNN sensitivity = 0.68,
specificity = 0.83; CNN-DNN sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.83.
Conclusion
Our findings provide an understanding of interventions that needs to be prioritized, in order
to reduce levels of U5M in LMICs. It also demonstrates that deep learning models are more
efficacious than a traditional analytical approach.

Introduction
Recent global estimates showed that 5.4 million under-five deaths occurred in 2017; this is
equivalent to 15,000 deaths every day and 39 deaths per 1000 live births (1). A majority of
the children who die before their fifth birthday live in sub-Saharan Africa and South-east
Asia; most of these deaths result from preventable and treatable causes (1,2). Although these
estimates represent a significant improvement in under-five mortality levels when compared
to the levels in the early 1990’s, ‘preventable death of one child is still too many’ (1,2).
High levels of under-five mortality in LMICs is usually a syndromic feature of a weak health
system (3), and U5MR is a key barometer of the state of a nation’s health system and an
important impact measure that is reliant on health system input such as health financing,
health workforce and infrastructure (3,4). These inputs in turn determine health service
access, readiness, quality and safety and consequently influences coverage of interventions
such as antenatal care coverage, postnatal care, demand for family planning satisfied, skilled
birth attendance, care for childhood illnesses, nutritional supplementation etc (4,5).
Studies have shown that improving child survival requires engaging intricately with a host
determinants of child health, including biological, environmental and social-economic factors
such as level of maternal education, household income, environmental sanitation and hygiene
(5–7). The framework of distal and proximate social, environmental and biological
determinants was first described by Mosley and colleagues (5). Unfortunately, many
developing countries are constrained by limited finances and limited health budgets, and are
unable to intervene on all of the determinants of child health at the same time (3). It is
therefore increasingly important to identify the most important determinants to be prioritise
and to determine the most pressing socio-economic issues that can serve as a starting point
for government and policy makers to focus intervention strategy.

Furthermore, intervention measures need to be equity-oriented in order to be effective (9,10).
Hence, disaggregated household level monitoring of coverage and impact indicators are
crucial for informing policies and programmatic interventions in the sustainable development
goal (SDG) era (9). It is important to understand the status of every child as against simply
exploring global trends, in order to “leave no one behind” and to “reach the furthest behind
first” (10). In light of the SDG pledge, monitoring changes at household or community level
may require new ways of engaging with the ‘big data’, that continues to be generated through
ongoing household surveys such as the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) (11,12). A shift away from traditional analytical approach
may be pertinent and key to effectively monitor health intervention coverage and impact.
Machine learning techniques may represent a novel analytical approach to unravel previously
unseen trends; these techniques expand on existing statistical approaches and use methods
that are not based on a priori assumptions about the distribution of the data” (13).
In a report recently released by the USAID centre for innovation and impact, on the use of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in global health, AI-Enabled population health was identified as
one of AI use cases, that could have the greatest impact on improving health quality, cost and
access in LMICs (14). AI-Enabled population health encompasses surveillance and
prediction, population risk management, intervention selection and intervention targeting
(14). In this current study, we explored the efficacy of deep learning as a technique for
population health surveillance and intervention targeting.
There have been numerous empirical studies on the various applications of machine learning
in hospital settings for prognostication (15,16), triage (17), and prediction of mortality in the
hospital setting(18). However, application of machine learning is yet to be demonstrated in
population health studies, where it may represent a potential transformative tool (13). The
objective of our study is to fill the gap on application of machine learning in population
health studies, and other previously highlighted gaps. One of the previously highlighted gaps
concerns the need to identify the most important determinants of U5MR. To explore these
determinants, we employed a data driven approach by using the random forest algorithm for
feature selection, rather than utilising the traditional hierarchical approach for multivariate
analysis, which tends to be highly user-driven and usually involving the development of
conceptual frameworks that pre-judges the relevance of a limited set of determinants
(independent variables) (19). Random Forest is an efficient classification and regression
algorithm that combines several randomized decision trees and aggregates their predictions It

is especially useful when the number of variables is larger than the number of observations
(20).
The RF approach allows an unlimited number of variables or determinants to be incorporated
into the model. The algorithm automatically tests several hypothesis and selects features that
best predicts the outcome, based on information gained from each variable (16).
Another gap is the need for new ways to gain insights and to unravel previously unseen
trends in the prediction of under-five mortality from disaggregated household level data. To
fill this gap, we also compared the efficacy of deep learning algorithms: Deep Neural
Network (DNN); Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Hybrid CNN-DNN with Logistic
Regression (LR) for classifying child survival, and for predicting age of death. Deep learning
“discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using backpropagation algorithm to indicate
how a machine should change its internal parameter used to compute representation in each
layer from the representation in the previous layer” (21). Deep learning algorithms have
shown excellent performance in genomics, proteomics, drug discovery, speech recognition,
visual recognition, object detection and several other domains (21).
Finally, in this work, we make recommendations on machine learning implementation, and
the new regulatory and ethical considerations for the use of novel ML techniques in public
health (22).

Methods
Data source and analytical tools
We conducted an analysis on DHS data from 21 low and middle-income countries. The DHS
is a nationally-representative household survey developed by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) in the 1980s (23). The survey provides data on fertility,
family planning, maternal and child health, gender, HIV/AIDS, Malaria and nutrition (24). In
total, over 350 surveys have been carried out in over 90 countries (23). The survey utilizes a
two-stage cluster sampling design (24). Combined multi-country data for this study was
obtained from the IPUMS-DHS portal (25). Permission to use data for all included countries
was granted by the DHS Program. Analysis was conducted using Python software Version
3.7. The programming codes used for the various analysis are accessible on Github using the
following link: https://github.com/drulna/u5mr_predict

Data pre-processing
Any real-world dataset needs pre-processing to convert it into a representation that can be
used to train a model. This can heavily affect the model’s performance. This dataset had
several irrelevant features, such as IPUMS identifiers created to merge multi-country data.
We excluded 14 such features and included 54 features in the final model. However, these
records still had missing values. There exist multiple strategies that can be deployed to handle
missing values (26). We used the “Forward Fill” strategy in which every missing value is
replaced by next real values for each column. This clean and pre-processed data was used for
the rest of the analysis (26).
Feature selection
We use random forest to check feature importance with respect to its predictive power.
Figure 2 shows the feature importance (red bar) and variance of each tree in random forest
(black vertical line). It can be observed that “Duration of breast feeding” has the most
importance to predict a child’s death. However, there are some features that are of limited
importance. We perform feature selection based on this information. We drop all features
whose importance are less than 0.001, because we found that the accuracy of the classifier
does not improve beyond this level, and adding the additional attributes only creates
unnecessary additional computational overhead. In total, 34 features fell within our cut-off
for feature importance and included in the final model. For comparing the utility of feature
selection, we perform two experiments. One without feature selection (on all original 54
features) and one with feature selection (on selected 34 features).

Model Selection
We selected multivariate logistic regression (LR) as an example of traditional model (16).
Three deep learning techniques (DNN, CNN and DNN-CNN) were selected as modern
machine learning approaches. For all the four models, we pose this problem as a multi-class
problem, such that each value in the label is assigned an integer and then we binarize the
output (i.e. one-hot encoding). All categorical attributes are also converted to numerical i.e
dummy variables, by mapping each unique value to a number. After careful consideration we
concluded that the best ratio for training is 75% of the data, while the remaining 25% of the
data is reserved for testing purposes. This choice is in line with literature and close to 80/20,
which is quite a commonly utilized training/testing ratio, often referred to as the Pareto

principle. We compare the performance of logistic regression (LR) as a representative of
traditional model, with three deep learning methods: deep network (DN), convolutional
neural network (CNN), and hybrid CNN-DN network.

Model Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of each model using a ROC plot, we also derived the weighted
precision, sensitivity (also known as recall), specificity, f1-score, and area under the curve
(AUC) for each model. The formula for calculating the performance metrics are as follows:
Precision =

The models were evaluated before and after feature selection. Analysis was initially
conducted using all pre-selected variables. We thereafter optimized the various models based
on empirical results from the random forest analysis. As this is a multi-class problem, the
ROC plots and performance metrics are all based on micro-averages.

Discussion
We found that the most important determinants of U5M are duration of breast feeding,
household wealth index and maternal education level. Previous studies corroborate our
findings. It has been shown that children breastfed for a longer duration have lower infectious
disease morbidity and mortality, and better chance of survival than those who are breastfed
for shorter periods, or not breastfed at all (27). Multiple studies have also shown that early
initiation of breast feeding, and exclusive breast feeding reduces both neonatal and early
infant mortality (27,28). It has been estimated that scaling up breast feeding can help prevent
an estimated 823,000 child deaths across 75 high-mortality LMICs (27). However, just over a

third of the total children population in low- and middle-income countries are breastfed; these
levels are even lower in industrialized nations (27). Effective approach to scaling up breast
feeding practices have been discussed in past literature For example, the Alive and Thrive
initiative in rural Burkina Faso involved the utilisation of a multidimensional approach,
which combines interpersonal communication and community mobilisation activities to
improve breast feeding knowledge, beliefs and skills; this invariably improved breast feeding
outcomes (29). A similar approach may be adopted and tailored to the needs in other
countries, to scale up breast feeding practices globally. In addition to breast feeding,
household wealth index and level of maternal education was also identified as important
determinants of child survival in our study. We found that the household wealth index was a
slightly more important determinant compared to level of education. This finding however
contradicts the work of Fuchs and colleagues, where they argued that mother’s education is
the fundamental determinant of child mortality and is relatively more important than income
level. They argued that education impacts the child’s health through better maternal health,
increased health-specific knowledge, avoidance of traditional, harmful behaviours, greater
economic resource as a consequence of education and general female empowerment (29).
They however highlighted that other social scientists have often considered education and
income as generally highly correlated and tend to be regarded as interchangeable indicators
of socioeconomic status (29). Other key determinants that we identified are the number of
antenatal visits when the child was in-utero and content of antenatal care (Tetanus
immunization), post-natal care, place of residence (urban-rural status), family planning,
desirability of the child and sex of the child. These determinants are congruent with the
multivariate model of proximal and distal determinants of U5M that have been previously
described in literature (5).
Our findings regarding the superiority of machine learning over traditional approaches such
as logistic regression in predictive analysis are also in line with findings elsewhere (16,30).
This study however has some limitations. Firstly, this is proof of a concept cross sectional
study; hence, we can only draw inference on associations, and not on causality. Secondly, we
did not measure change over time. Future studies should consider incorporating temporal data
points, in order to draw inference on changes over time, and possibly causality. Finally, we
did not explore individual country, regional and subgroup level variations and cannot
conclude that the degree of association is the same across different countries and sub-groups,
due to differences in socio-economic, geographical, cultural and political realities. Hence,

future studies should consider disaggregating with stratifiers such as income, education, and
place of residence, in order to explore sub-group differences.
Recommendations for ML Implementation, governance and ethics
Our recommendations regarding the implementation and regulation of machine learning are
in four folds. Firstly, there is a burgeoning risk that the adoption and benefits of ML may be
imbalanced (31). High income countries are beginning to increasingly adopt and benefit from
deploying some of these novel technologies; therefore, there is the risk of extending the
disparity between poor and rich countries even further. To achieve equity in the
implementation of this technology, there is a need for capacity building across board and
collaborative use of technological resources between low- and high-income countries.
Secondly, regarding AI research governance and ethics (regulation), the capabilities of AI
application in public health are not yet fully understood, and its application is still evolving.
This implies that any regulatory attempt will effectively require understanding the
capabilities of AI as a tool in public health and medicine. Similar to other medical research
endeavours, the regulatory framework and ethical guidelines will have to evolve, as our
understanding of the application of AI evolves. As such, we posit that there is a concordance
between regulation, governance, research and development of AI technology. In the light of
this, we suggest collaboration between research institutions, academic stakeholders, policy
makers, and regulatory authorities. There is a need to engage with all stakeholders across the
spectrum of AI research, development and ethics.
Thirdly, we believe that existing medical research ethical guidelines are highly applicable and
cover several aspects of ML research. However, there is a need to strengthen regulatory
aspects pertaining to data security and protection. The growth in the adoption of ML
analytical techniques will usher an increase in the level of data transactions and with this,
comes the potential risk of breaches to health data privacy. There are existing capabilities to
re-identify anonymised data, using a few parameters within the data. Hence, regulatory
efforts need to focus on data security, especially reducing the risks of data re-identification.
Fourthly, as knowledge and application of AI continues to grow in leaps and bounds, and
while regulatory efforts are still rudimentary and trying to catch up, we envisage a vacuum in
governance, that will have to be filled. As such, there may be a need for the development and
ratification of regulatory framework, which may be possible through the collaboration of
multiple stakeholders.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates the superiority of machine learning as a tool for understanding
previously unseen insights in large global health data. We have shown that machine learning
algorithms such as random forest, may be more insightful than the user dependent traditional
hierarchical approach of testing a limited set of determinants for outcome prediction in
multivariate analysis. Using random forest, we found that duration of breast feeding,
household wealth index, and level of maternal education are the most important determinants
of U5MR. In addition, we also show that deep learning algorithms are more sensitive and
specific for the prediction of U5MR and this finding may be applicable to other multivariate
models, for data-rich population studies.
Going forward, the most important implication of this study is that if deep learning
algorithms such as the one we describe in this study, are deployed in production in
combination with spatial data, it is possible to identify and flag children who are most at risk
and not likely to survive until the age of five, such that necessary interventions can be
targeted to communities where those children live. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
existing studies that have investigated under five mortality, using a similar analytical
approach.
