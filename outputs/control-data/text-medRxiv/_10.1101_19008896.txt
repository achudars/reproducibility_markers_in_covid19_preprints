Novelty and impact statement:
The residual cancer burden index (RCB) quantifies residual disease following neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NAC) and was developed as a prediction tool. The evaluation of its prognostic
value in a large real-life cohort of breast cancer patients stratified according to the different
subtypes of BC (Luminal, HER2-positive and triple negative (TNBCs)) could improve breast
cancer patients’ prognosis by identifying those at a high risk of recurrence, who should be
offered second line adjuvant therapies.

ABSTRACT (249 words):
Introduction: The Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) quantifies residual disease after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Its predictive value has not been validated on large
cohorts with long-term follow up. The objective of this work is to independently evaluate the
prognostic value of the RCB index depending on BC subtypes (Luminal, HER2-positive and
triple negative (TNBCs)).
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the RCB index on surgical specimens from a cohort
of T1-T3NxM0 BC patients treated with NAC between 2002 and 2012. We analyzed the
association between RCB index and relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) among
the global population, after stratification by BC subtypes.
Results: 717 patients were included (luminal BC (n = 222, 31%), TNBC (n = 319, 44.5%),
HER2-positive (n = 176, 24.5%)). After a median follow-up of 99.9 months, RCB index was
significantly associated with RFS. The RCB-0 patients displayed similar prognosis when
compared to the RCB-I group, while patients from the RCB-II and RCB-III classes were at
increased risk of relapse (RCB-II versus RCB-0: HR=3.25 CI [2.1-5.1] p<0.001; RCB-III
versus RCB-0: HR=5.6 CI [3.5-8.9] p<0.001). The prognostic impact of RCB index was
significant for TNBC and HER2-positive cancers; but not for luminal cancers (Pinteraction =
0.07). The prognosis of RCB-III patients was poor (8-years RFS: 52.7%, 95% CI [44.8 –
62.0]) particularly in the TNBC subgroup, where the median RFS was 12.7 months.
Conclusion: RCB index is a reliable prognostic score. RCB accurately identifies patients at a
high risk of recurrence (RCB-III) with TNBC or HER2-positive BC who must be offered
second-line adjuvant therapies.

INTRODUCTION

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), i.e. chemotherapy before surgery, is currently being
used in poor prognosis breast carcinoma. Besides reducing tumor burden and enabling
conservative breast surgery, NAC also provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the response
of patients with breast cancer (BC) to different treatments. Pathologic complete response
(pCR), defined as an absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, is
associated with better long-term survival, though its prognostic value is particularly important
in highly aggressive tumors, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-positive
BC (Cortazar et al., 2014).
However, since most of the tumors do not achieve pCR following NAC, this binary indicator
gathers in a unique category the majority of the patients, thus precluding the opportunity to
sharply predict their oncological outcome. While patients with pCR exhibit an excellent
prognosis, a wide clinical heterogeneity remains within those patients failing to reach
complete response, and the identification of patients with residual disease at a high risk of
relapse is a substantial challenge. Hence, the subdivision of the BC population into several
prognostic groups could help improving the prediction of survival benefits (Hatzis et al.,
2013).
The Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) index has been developed in 2007 by Symmans and
colleagues from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) (Symmans et al., 2007a) to
quantify residual disease following NAC. The RCB index combines pathological findings in
the primary tumor bed and the regional lymph nodes to calculate a continuous index. This
index is subdivided into four classes with an increasing amount of residual disease: RCB 0
(pCR), RCB-I, RCB-II, and RCB-III. Several prospective clinical studies (CALGB (Hylton et
al., 2016), GEICAM (Martín et al., 2017) and I-SPY (Cureton et al., 2014)) included RCB as

a primary or secondary end point for response to NAC. Among the variety of scoring systems
developed in the last years (CPS (Jeruss et al., 2008a), CPS+EG, Neobioscore ( Mittendorf et
al., 2016) RCB index was recommended by the BIG-NABCG (Breast International GroupNorth American Breast Cancer Group) to quantify residual disease in neoadjuvant trials, in
addition to pCR (Bossuyt et al., 2015). However, so far, it remains unknown if RCB index
displays high prognostic performances in routine practice, and external fully independent
validation of the prognostic value of the RCB index is lacking. The current study aims at
evaluating the prognostic value of the RCB index in a large real-life cohort of breast cancer
patients treated with NAC.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Patients and tumors
The analysis was performed on a cohort of patients with invasive breast carcinoma stage T1T3NxM0 and treated with NAC at Institut Curie, Paris, between 2002 and 2012 (NEOREP
Cohort, CNIL declaration number 1547270). We included unilateral, non-recurrent, noninflammatory, non-metastatic tumors, excluding T4 tumors. All patients received NAC,
followed by surgery and radiotherapy. NAC regimens changed over our recruitment period
(anthracycline-based regimen or sequential anthracycline-taxanes regimen), with trastuzumab
used in an adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant setting since 2005. Endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or
aromatase inhibitor) was prescribed when indicated. The study was approved by the Breast
Cancer Study Group of Institut Curie and was conducted according to institutional and ethical
rules regarding research on tissue specimens and patients. Written informed consent from the
patients was not required by French regulations.

Tumor samples
Cases were considered estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) positive (+) if at
least 10% of the tumor cells expressed estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (ER/PR), in
accordance with guidelines used in France (Harvey et al., 1999). HER2 expression was
determined by immunohistochemistry with scoring in accordance with American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines(Wolff et al.,
2007) .Scores 3+ were reported as positive, score 1+/0 as negative (-). Tumors with scores 2+
were further tested by FISH. HER2 gene amplification was defined in accordance with
ASCO/CAP guidelines(Wolff et al., 2007). We evaluated a mean of 40 tumor cells per sample
and the mean HER2 signals per nuclei was calculated. A HER2/CEN17 ratio ≥ 2 was
considered positive, and a ratio < 2 negative (Wolff et al., 2007). BC subtypes were defined as
follows: tumors positive for either ER or PR, and negative for HER2 were classified as
luminal; tumors positive for HER2 were considered to be HER2-positive BC; tumors negative
for ER, PR, and HER2 were considered to be triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Tumor
cellularity was defined as the percentage of tumor cells (in situ and invasive) on the specimen
(biopsy or surgical specimen). Mitotic index was reported per 10 high power fields (HPF) (1
HPF= 0.301 mm2).

Pathological review
717 post-NAC pathological pretreatment core needle biopsies and the corresponding postNAC surgical specimens were reviewed independently by two experts in breast diseases
(ML, DD).

Histological components of the “Residual Cancer Burden” were retrieved for calculating the
score as described in 2007 by Symmans (see Supplementary Material). RCB index enables

the classification of residual disease into four categories: RCB-0 (complete pathologic
response = pCR), RCB-I (minimal residual disease), RCB-II (moderate residual disease) and
RCB-III (extensive residual disease). Two cutoff points defined those subgroups: the first
(RCB-III v RCB-I/II) was selected as the 87th percentile (RCB, 3.28), and the second (RCB-I
v RCB-II) corresponds to the 40th percentile (RCB, 1.36). RCB has been calculated through
the web-based calculator that is freely available on the internet
(www.mdanderson.org/breastcancer_RCB).
TILs and LVI
Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was defined as the presence of carcinoma cells within a finite
endothelial-lined space (a lymphatic or blood vessel). Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
were defined as the presence of mononuclear cells infiltrate (including lymphocytes and
plasma cells, excluding polymorphonuclear leukocytes), and were also evaluated
retrospectively, for research purposes (see Supplementary Material).

Study endpoints
Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time from surgery to death, loco-regional
recurrence or distant recurrence, whichever occurred first. Overall survival (OS) was defined
as the time from surgery to death. The date of last known contact was retained for patients for
whom none of these events were recorded. Survival cutoff date analysis was February, 1st,
2019.
Statistical analysis
The study population was described in terms of frequencies for qualitative variables, or
medians and associated ranges for quantitative variables. Khi2 tests were performed to search
for differences between subgroups for each variable (considered significant for p-values ≤

0.05). Survival probabilities were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method, and survival curves
were compared in log-rank tests. Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were
calculated with the Cox proportional hazards model. Variables with a p-value for the
likelihood ratio test equal to 0.05 or lower in univariate analysis were selected for inclusion in
the multivariate analysis. A forward stepwise selection procedure was used to establish the
final multivariate model and the significance threshold was 5%. Missing data were present in
69 out of 717 patients (9.6%) for the variable lymphovascular invasion and we imputed these
missing data by a chained equation multiple imputation strategy, as recommended in a
previous study(Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). We assessed the effect of the RCB
index both on the hazard scale (with a proportional hazards model) and on the log-of-time
scale with an accelerated failure time model. Data were processed and statistical analyses
were carried out with R software version 3.1.2 (www.cran.r-project.org, (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, 2009).

RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics
A total of 717 patients were included in the cohort. Patients and tumors characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. Median age was 48 years old (range [25-80]) and most of the patients
(63%) were premenopausal. BC repartition by subtype was as follows: luminal (n=222; 31%),
TNBC (n=319; 44.5%), HER2-positive (n=176; 24.5%). No difference was observed
according to BC subtype regarding age, menopausal status, clinical tumor size nor clinical
nodal status. TNBC and HER2-positive BCs were associated with a higher grade, Ki67 and
mitotic index than luminal BCs (p<0.001).

At NAC completion, RCB-0 (pCR) was observed in 202 patients (28.2%). Among 515
patients with residual disease, RCB index repartition was as follows RCB-I: n=65 (9%),
RCB-II: n=309 (43.1%) and RCB-III: n=141 (19.7%) (Table 2, Figure 1A). The RCB index
distribution was significantly different by BC subtypes (p<0.001) (Table 2, Fig.1B): luminal
tumors were more likely to be classified as RCB-II (49.1%) or III (36.9%), whereas TNBC or
HER2-positive BC were more likely to be RCB-0 or I (45.7% and 52.3% respectively)
(p<0.001). Only small subsets of TNBC and HER2-positive BCs were classified as RCB-III
(13.2% and 8.5% respectively).
The distribution of the index was bimodal as previously described ((Symmans et al., 2007a)),
and the 2 modes of the distribution strongly overlapped with the post-NAC nodal status
(Figures 2A-B). Most of the patients with tumors classified as RCB-I were free from axillar
nodal involvement, while the majority of patients with tumors classified as RCB-III had a
node-positive disease (Figures 2C-D).
Patients’ characteristics by RCB class are summarized in Table 2 and are represented in
Figure 3. Among pre-NAC parameters, RCB class was significantly different by tumor size
(p<0.001) (Fig.3A), clinical nodal status (p<0.001) (Figure 3B), pathological grade (p<0.001)
(Figure 3C), BMI (p<0.05) (Figure 3D) and mitotic index (p<0.001) (Figure 3E). Pre-NAC
TILs were inversely associated with RCB (p<0.001) (Figure 3F). Among the post-NAC
parameters, higher RCB class was significantly correlated with the presence of LVI (p<0.001;
Figure 3G), nodal involvement (p<0.001; Figure 3H), whereas post-NAC TILs were
positively associated with RCB (p<0.001; Figure 3I).

Survival analyses

significantly associated with RFS (Figure 4A), and this association was significant after both
univariate analysis and multivariate analysis (Table 3). Eight-years relapse free survival was
good in RCB-0 and RCB-I group (89.9%, CI [85.6 – 94.4] and 89.0% CI [80.7 – 98.2]
respectively), whereas the prognosis was intermediate in RCB-II patients (67.8%, CI [62.4 –
73.5]) and poor in RCB-III patients (52.7%, CI [44.8 – 62.0]). Increasing RCB was associated
with an increased risk of relapse (RCB-II versus RCB-0: HR=3.25 CI [2.1-5.1] p<0.001 and
RCB-III versus RCB-0: HR=5.6 CI [3.5-9.0] p<0.001). The prognosis impact of the RCB
index was significant in TNBC and HER2-positive BCs, but not in luminal BC (Fig. 4.B-D
and supp. Tables 1-2-3) (Pinteraction=0.05, though the interaction test failed to reach statistical
significance after multivariate analysis (Pinteraction=0.057)). In addition to the increased risk of
relapse, RCB index was also significantly associated with an earlier time-to-relapse , as
estimated by the AFT regression model (RCB II versus RCB 0 and I grouped, HR= 3.27, 95%
CI [2.18- 4.91], RCB-III versus RCB 0 and I grouped, HR= 5.73, 95% CI [3.74- 8.76]
p<0.001), and this was true in TNBC and HER2-positive BCs (p<0.001) but not in luminal
BCs (p=0.06). In TNBC, RCB-III class identified a group of patients with extremely poor
prognosis, displaying a median relapse-free survival of 12.7 months. We also identified an
interaction between post-NAC TILs and RCB class to predict RFS (Pinteraction=0.03). PostNAC TILs had no prognostic impact on RFS in pCR, RCB-I and RCB-II subgroups, while
post-NAC TILs had a poor prognostic impact (HR=1.019, [1.001-1.037]) in the RCB-III
subgroup.
Overall survival analyses yielded similar results (Figure 5, Table 4, Supp. Tables 4-5-6).
Together with BC subtype, RCB index was the only independent predictor of survival in the
whole population.

DISCUSSION:
In this retrospective reanalysis of 717 surgical specimens of BC patients treated with NAC
with a long-term follow-up, we confirm the strong prognostic value of the RCB index.
RCB index was first created in 2007 by Symmans and colleagues on a cohort of 241 BC
patients who completed NAC (Symmans et al., 2007a). In this study, patients had almost a
two-fold increase in relapse risk for each unit of increase in the RCB index and it remained
significantly associated with the risk of disease recurrence after multivariate analysis. Though
RCB is a composite endpoint built upon 6 variables, this index was shown to be highly
reproducible (Peintinger et al., 2015). Peintinger et al. retrospectively assessed RCB on a
series of 100 pathology slides from BC cases treated by NAC, and the overall concordance
was 0.93 (95%CI=0.91-0.95) after an independent review by five pathologists. However, so
far, the prognostic value of the index was evaluated only in small studies ((Campbell et al.,
2017; Cockburn et al., 2014; Corben et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014; Romero et al., 2013; Sheri
et al., 2015; Symmans et al., 2007a, 2017)(Supp. Table 7). To the best of our knowledge, we
report here the largest fully independent cohort available with a long-term follow-up, with a
notably high number of patients with TNBCs.
Several findings of our study are of interest. First, in line with the findings of Symmans and
colleagues, we found that the prognosis of patients with RCB-I was not significantly different
than the prognosis of patients whose tumor reached pCR (RCB-0). The latter finding confirms
that the category of pCR patients, known to be at a very low-risk of relapse, could be
extended to patients with minimal residual disease. Second, we also confirm the very poor
prognosis of patients with RCB-III disease, particularly in TNBC patients where the postNAC median RFS barely exceeded one year. The identification of poor-prognosis after NAC
is of substantial importance, as data from the CREATE-X and the KATHERINE trials suggest

that these patients may benefit from the addition of adjuvant capecitabine (Masuda et al.,
2017) in the TNBC subpopulation, or adjuvant TDM-1 in HER2-positive BCs respectively
(von Minckwitz et al., 2019). In the latter trials, both second-line therapies were associated
with a decrease of the recurrence risk, nearly reaching 50%. Finally, patients with RCB-II
disease displayed an intermediate prognosis, and it remains unknown if they would benefit
from additional therapies. As they represent 40% of the cohort, further prognostic subsetting
using genomic signatures or additional clinical or pathological features should be of particular
interest in this group.
In our cohort, RCB index displayed a strong discriminative power in TNBC and HER2positive BC but not in luminal BCs, and we identified a trend towards an interaction
(Pinteraction=0.07) between BC subtype and RCB class. This finding is consistent with the wellknown fact that BC subtypes respond differentially to NAC (Rouzier et al., 2005), and that the
prognostic value of pCR is greatest in aggressive tumor subtypes as TNBC or HER2-positive
BC (Cortazar et al., 2014) (von Minckwitz et al., 2012) than in luminal BCs. Of note,
Symmans and colleagues previously published the SET index signature assaying 165 genes
from ER-related transcription. On a cohort of 131 patients with ER+ BC treated with prior
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, both the RCB index and the SET index were independently
predictive of the distant relapse risk and the elevated endocrine sensitivity was associated
with reduced relapse risk when there was less than extensive RCB after chemotherapy. In this
context, the validation of the SET index signature in an independent NAC-treated cohort
would be of interest.
Last, our study opens new perspectives for further improvement of the RCB index. We
recently demonstrated that the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) after NAC was
associated with a dramatically impaired relapse-free survival in a BC subtype-dependent
manner (Hamy et al., 2018), and we show here that this feature adds an independent

prognostic information to the RCB in the whole population, and in every BC subtype but
luminal BCs. We also previously pointed out an interaction between RCB and the presence of
stromal immune infiltration after chemotherapy (Hamy et al., 2019), and identified an
impaired prognostic impact of post-NAC TILs in the RCB-III subgroup. As immunotherapy
is increasingly becoming part of the therapeutic strategy of breast cancer (Emens, 2018; Loi et
al., 2016; McArthur et al., 2016; Nanda et al., 2017; Vonderheide et al., 2010), the
combination of both patterns could be an efficient tool to select poor-prognostic patients
likely to benefit from such innovative treatments.
