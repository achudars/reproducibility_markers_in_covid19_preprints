Abstract

21

Background: Tests of binocular vision (BVTs) and ocular motility are used in concussion

22

assessment and management.

23

Purpose: To determine the one-week test-retest reliability of 9 binocular vision tests (BVTs) and

24

a test of saccades proposed for use in concussion management.

25

Study Design: Prospective test-retest.

26

Methods: We examined the one-week test-retest reliability of 9 BVTs in healthy participants: 3D

27

vision (gross stereoscopic acuity), phoria at 30cm and 3m, ability of eyes to move/fixate in-sync

28

(positive and negative fusional vergence at 30cm and 3m, near point of convergence and near

29

point of convergence – break [i.e. double vision]) and 1 ocular motor test, saccades.

30

Results: We tested 10 males and 10 females without concussion and a mean age of 25.5 (4.1)

31

years. The intraclass correlations suggest good reliability for phoria 3m (0.88) and gross

32

stereoscopic acuity (0.86), and moderate reliability for phoria 30cm (0.69), near point of

33

convergence (0.54), positive fusional vergence (0.54) and negative fusional vergence (0.66) at

34

30cm, and near point of convergence - break (0.64). There was poor reliability for saccades

35

(0.34), and both positive and negative fusional vergence (0.49 and 0.43, respectively) at 3m.

36

Limits of agreement (LoA) were best for saccade (±34%) and worst for phoria 30 cm (±121%)

37

and ranged from ±58% to ±70% for 7 of the 8 other tests. The LoA for phoria at 3m were

38

uninformative because measurements for 18 of 20 participants were identical.

39

Conclusion: We found test-retest reliability of the BVTs and saccades ranging from poor to

40

good in healthy participants, with the majority being moderate.

41

Clinical Relevance: For these vision tests to be clinically useful, the effect of concussion must

42

have a moderate to large effect on the scores of most of the tests.

Introduction

55

Many brain-related disorders (e.g. concussion,29 Parkinson’s Disease,6 attention deficit

56

hyperactivity disorder,20 stroke44) have a visual component as part of their findings.24 For

57

example, posttraumatic vision impairments have been reported in 30% to 65% of patients with a

58

mild traumatic brain injury,11 and are found in nearly 30% of patients with a sport-related

59

concussion.25 Some symptoms associated with concussion are believed to be caused by

60

deficits in the visual system and include: headaches, sensitivity to light, diplopia, and blurred

61

vision.12

62

Tests of binocular vision (BVTs) and ocular motility over the last 70 years 9 include 9,23,37: gross

63

stereoscopic acuity, near point of convergence - break (i.e. double vision), phoria at 30cm and

64

3m, positive and negative fusional vergence at 30cm and 3m, and saccadic eye movement

65

assessment. Recent studies have suggested that concussion may result in deficits of

66

convergence, binocular vision, and ocular motility.4,12,45 Convergence insufficiency is a disorder

67

of binocular vision diagnosed by abnormal near point of convergence, one of many BVTs that

68

assesses an individual’s visual capacity.

69

Before we can conclude that visual function is abnormal in concussion, we must first understand

70

the test-retest reliability of vision tests in healthy control participants. Despite their frequent use,

71

limited studies have examined the reliability of these vision tests. When evaluating the one-

72

week test-retest reliability of the Randot Stereotest (test of gross stereoscopic acuity), 71-82%

73

of adult and child participants with normal vision and with strabismus had perfect agreement

74

between two measurements;17,48 common psychometric properties such as intraclass

75

correlation coefficient (ICC) or limits of agreement (LoA) were not reported. An older study of

76

near point of convergence reported an ICC of 0.65 across six testing sessions in six healthy

77

adults, but failed to specify the number of examiners or the time interval between testing

sessions.10 A study of near point of convergence – break in school-aged children reported

79

excellent reliability (ICC≥0.94).36 A more recent study of three consecutive measurements of

80

near point of convergence – break without a rest interval between tests, found ICCs ranging

81

from 0.78-0.89 in young concussed athletes with convergence insufficiency and 0.92-0.97 in

82

concussed athletes with normal vision.31 When examining phoria with the prism alternate cover

83

test, one study reported 95% LoA of ±4.1 to ±7.3 prism diopters for distance and ±3.3 to ±8.3

84

prism diopters for near in young children with esotropia, but did not provide ICC.32 A one-week

85

test-retest reliability study assessing positive fusional vergence with a prism bar reported ICCs

86

ranging from 0.53-0.59.36 One to ten day test-retest reliability of the prism bar test had 95% LoA

87

± 4.0 for negative fusional vergence and ±13.9 for positive fusional vergence.5 Finally, the only

88

study we could find that measured reliability for saccades used a computerized prosaccade

89

task. The authors reported moderate two-month test-retest reliability (ICC=0.59) in adult

90

participants with normal vision.16

91

The above studies provide some information regarding the reliability of these vision tests.

92

However, vision tests are used to follow patients over time, and one might expect additional

93

variability when patients are measured on different days due to fatigue, stress, and other

94

factors. Understanding the usual variability that is independent of changes in pathology or

95

recovery is essential for proper interpretation of trends in results over time. Therefore, the

96

objective of this study was to determine the one-week test-retest reliability of 9 BVTs and a test

97

of saccades in healthy adult participants. We evaluated versions of these visions tests that are

98

commonly used by clinicians as opposed to versions used in research studies in order to best

99

assess the utility of the tests in clinical practice. All tests in the present study were performed by

100

the same clinician on two testing dates.

Methods

102

Study Design

103

We examined a convenience sample of healthy colleagues, friends, and social connections in

104

Montreal, Canada on two separate occasions exactly seven days apart at approximately the

105

same time of day (e.g. morning vs. evening). One individual clinician trained in orthoptics

106

examined all participants individually. We arranged for 4-6 participants to be examined

107

sequentially in a two to three-hour block of time. We randomized the order in which participants

108

were examined using a random number generator within each block. To minimize the probability

109

of the clinician recalling the first scores at the second visit: (1) the clinician verbally reported the

110

results to a research assistant (recorded on paper) and was not informed of any scores until

111

data collection was completed, and (2) at the second visit, the same group of 4-6 participants

112

was examined over the same block of time but their examination order was changed compared

113

to the first visit. This study was approved by the Jewish General Hospital Institutional Review

114

Board.

115

Participant Selection

116

We included healthy adults 18 to 35 years. There were no participants with a history of

117

conditions that may affect BVTs (or treatment for such conditions) or saccades such as

118

strabismus (contraindication to BVTs), migraines, neurological disorders, or currently taking

119

muscle relaxants, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, anxiolytics, stimulants, or any other

120

drug class for other psychological conditions that might affect test results. Although there were

121

three subjects with remote history of concussion, they had fully recovered and were not

122

experiencing concussion symptoms or related limitations at the time of our study.

123

Clinical procedures and measures

124

We collected the following demographic information at the first visit: date of birth, sex, highest

125

level of education achieved, use of corrective lenses, occupation, and any relevant past medical

126

history (e.g. migraines, vision problems, use of medication, history of concussion).

127

Prior to conducting the vision tests, each participant first completed the symptom portion of the

128

validated sport concussion assessment tool (SCAT3) form.1,51 These results were used as a

129

sensitivity analysis to evaluate if changes in their physical states at the two testing sessions

130

might explain potential discrepancies.

131

Vision Tests

132

We examined 9 BVTs and a test of saccades. For gross stereoscopic acuity, near point of

133

convergence, near point of convergence – break and phoria, a lower score represents better

134

vision function. For positive and negative fusional vergence, and saccades, a higher score

135

represents better vision function. Brief descriptions of each are provided below and more details

136

are available in the Appendix.

137

For gross stereoscopic acuity, we used the Randot Stereotest (Stereo Optical Co., Inc.,

138

Chicago, IL) according to manufacturer’s instructions.43 For all tests using a target, the tip of a

139

ballpoint pen was used as the near target, and a 6cm2 square card mounted on a wall was used

140

as the far target. For near point of convergence and near point of convergence - break, we

141

followed procedures by Maples et al.27 The near point of convergence score was the distance

142

(cm) between the bridge of the nose and the target at the closest point at which the individual

143

could maintain balanced oculomotor synergy between both eyes, which is identified as when

144

one eye diverges outwards.9 The near point of convergence – break score was the distance

145

between the bridge of the nose and the point at which diplopia occurred.7,23 We measured

146

phoria at 30cm and 3m using the prism alternate cover test with procedures described by the

Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group.32 For positive and negative fusional vergence at

148

30cm and 3m, we used a horizontal prism bar (base-out for positive fusional vergence, base-in

149

for negative fusional vergence).19 To evaluate saccades, we used the specific testing

150

procedures of our clinician. In his test of saccades, participants assumed a tandem stance and

151

attempted to move only their eyes when lights appeared and disappeared (using a gap protocol

152

in which the first light disappeared before the second appeared) on the screen. The clinician

153

evaluated their performance qualitatively along three measures: quality (bad, medium, good),

154

synchronization (bad, medium, good), and saccadic correction (many, few, none).

155

Statistical Analysis

156

Reliability Estimates

157

We evaluated test-retest reliability using statistical measures for consistency and accuracy i.e.

158

the intra class correlation coefficient (ICC)42 and 95% limits of agreement (LoA).8 We considered

159

an ICC of ≤0.5 as poor, 0.51 - 0.74 as moderate, 0.75 - 0.89 as good, and ≥0.90 as excellent

160

reliability.26 When multiple participant scores were the same, we used the jitter function in the R

161

software34 to slightly modify the scores when plotting the results so they would appear distinct

162

from each other.

163

The LoA were calculated as recommended in the units of the scale measured.8 To compare LoA

164

across tests, we also standardized the scores and reported them as percentage difference [(T1-

165

T2)/mean(T1&T2)*100]. The LoA results were summarized graphically with Bland-Altman plots.8

166

We used the raw scale measures commonly known to clinicians for the y-axis, and report the

167

standardized version in parentheses to provide an overview of all tests.

168

Due to the limited sample size and to avoid being overly conservative in our evaluation, we

169

followed the practical solution for addressing multiple testing proposed by Saville.38 Formal

multiplicity correction of confidence levels was not performed but we thoroughly report all

171

statistical assessments enabling an informal type I error assessment by the reader.

172

Effect of Physical State

173

As a sensitivity analysis, we wanted to explore if a participant’s change in physical state could

174

have been associated with their vision test scores. We, therefore, compared the change in

175

BVTs and saccade scores against the change in SCAT3 symptom scores using the Pearson’s

176

correlation coefficient. Although we report p-values for these comparisons, we caution that

177

these are minimum values as we did not correct for multiple testing.

178

All statistical analyses were performed on R software 3.4.3.,34 plots were created using the

179

ggplot2 package.50

180

A priori sample size calculation

181

Sample size calculations were done prior to the study. We used a precision-based method for

182

sample size calculations based on the ICC. Since the expected estimate for ICCs is zero, our

183

sample size calculation relied on specifying the maximum acceptable width of the confidence

184

interval for the measure of agreement. We considered the lower bound of clinical acceptability

185

to be an ICC of 0.5,49 and expected the true ICC for repeated assessment of the different vision

186

test scores to be at least 0.75. Therefore, we believed that our estimate imprecision (95%

187

confidence interval width / 2) should not exceed 0.25. With 20 participants, under the postulated

188

assumptions, the precision of the ICC estimate was anticipated to be ± 0.20.49

189

Results

190

Of 47 potential participants identified, 26 had scheduling conflicts, one was not able to attend

191

the second visit and was excluded from the analysis, leaving 20 participants for the final

192

analysis.

Demographic data for the sample analyzed is included in Table 1. Our sample included 50%

194

females with an average age of 25.5 years (SD=4.1, range=18-35), almost all university

195

educated, with 55% wearing corrective lenses with an up-to-date prescription. None of the

196

participants had any history of vision symptoms or a history of past binocular vision therapy.

197

There were six participants who had previously sustained one or two concussions, which

198

occurred 2 to 15 years prior to our study; none of these individuals reported any residual

199

concussion symptoms at the time of our study. Additionally, the three participants who had

200

reported taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or anxiolytics had not received the

201

medication for at least five years as they no longer suffered from the condition.

Two BVTs achieved good reliability. For phoria 3m (ICC=0.88), 18 out of 20 pairs of

210

measurements were identical at test and retest, with one participant scoring 0 and 1 prism

211

diopters, and the other scoring 0 and 2 prism diopters. Due to this highly skewed score

212

distribution, the 95% LoA are relatively uninformative (data not shown). The ICC for gross

213

stereoscopic acuity was 0.86 (Figure 1). For this test, 5 out of 20 pairs of measurements were

214

identical, with the remaining pairs differing by 5 to 40 arc seconds; the 95% LoA was ±27.6 arc

Effect of Changes in Physical State

260

In our sensitivity analysis, a participant’s physical state (as measured by the SCAT3 symptom

261

score) was not relevantly associated with their BVT scores across testing sessions. Pearson’s

262

correlations between changes in vision test scores and changes in symptom scores ranged

263

from -0.006 to 0.31 for all vision tests (p-values ranged from 0.19 to 0.98).

264

Discussion

265

Our results suggest that only 2 out of 10 vision tests demonstrated good reliability, and 5

266

additional tests had moderate reliability. There was poor reliability for saccades and both

267

positive and negative fusional vergence at 3m. The 95% LoA suggests that even with good or

268

moderate reliability, one can expect that scores for an individual with repeated measures may

269

vary by 50-70% of the mean score across all measures even if there is no change in visual

270

function. These results highlight the need for more accurate, quantifiable, and repeatable tests

271

since one might expect even more variability in a patient population compared to the healthy

272

population that we studied. Further studies are necessary to determine if changes to visual

273

function with concussion or other neurological injury (the resultant signal) are large enough to

274

be noticed given the amount of inherent noise in the tests.

275

We used the Randot Stereotest to assess gross stereoscopic acuity. Our ICC of 0.86 and 95%

276

LoA of ±27.6 arc seconds support previous findings of good reliability in adults in the one-week

time frame. The 95% LoA were previously reported as ±0.57 log arc seconds (our results are

278

±0.58 log arc seconds using the same method of calculation) based on 36 patients between 7 to

279

76 years of age; time between testing intervals ranged from 10 to 364 days using a different

280

examiner at each time point.2 Another study reported that 82.0% of their participants had

281

identical results at test and retest taken same day in 111 adult and children with normal vision,

282

but normal psychometric properties such as ICC or LoA were not reported.48 A study examining

283

the one-week test-retest reliability of gross stereoscopic acuity using the related Titmus fly test

284

in 90 children reported perfect reliability (ICC=1.0)28. The Random dot “E” stereotest reported

285

only interrater agreement (Kw=0.33-0.44) in 1257 children, but not test-retest reliability.46

286

In the literature, there is no clear distinction between measures of near point of convergence

287

and near point of convergence – break. Further, near point of convergence is sometimes

288

referred to as a measurement of gross convergence with fusional convergence22 and other

289

times as gross convergence with proximal convergence.21,22,47 The inconsistent use of these

290

terms complicates comparisons across studies when the measurement procedure is not

291

reported. The Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial Study13 considered near point of

292

convergence – break as the point “[w]hen diploplia was reported,” which is consistent with our

293

definition.7,23 We defined near point of convergence as the closest point at which one eye

294

diverges outwards.9,23,37 Across the literature, near point of convergence and near point of

295

convergence – break are sometimes used interchangeably. For instance, near point of

296

convergence has been defined as the point “when the target blurs, jumps or becomes double,”37

297

“when [the participant] saw 2 distinct images,”31 and “when the patient reported diplopia”.4

298

We found moderate reliability for both near point of convergence and near point of convergence

299

– break, whereas others have reported good to excellent reliability.31,36 In our measurement

300

procedure, participants fixated on a target that the clinician moved towards their eyes in free

301

space as used by some clinicians and researchers in the concussion field.29 Others used an

accommodative target, such as the Royal Air Force (RAF) rule,7,37 or Astron International

303

(ACR/21) Accommodative Rule.13,22,36,40 The RAF rule had good (ICC=0.84) test-retest reliability

304

for near point of convergence in 3 subjects with idiopathic neck pain and 7 healthy subjects, but

305

the test interval was only specified as less than one-week.18 The Astron International

306

Accommodative Rule had excellent one-week test-retest reliability (ICC=0.94-0.98) in 20

307

healthy children for near point of convergence – break.36 Although tests using these

308

accommodative targets may have increased reliability compared to the methods used in this

309

study, one would generally like to minimize the accommodative load in patients with concussion

310

because it may increase symptoms. Some of the variability in our results is likely explained by

311

accommodation variability in our participants. We found no studies directly comparing the

312

reliability of the different procedures. Sheiman et al 39 and Rouse et al 36 provide a more

313

complete discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods used to

314

assess near point of convergence.

315

Measurements of phoria using the prism alternate cover test had good reliability for distance

316

(ICC=0.88) and moderate reliability for near (ICC=0.69). These results are consistent with other

317

studies which measured adult and child participants with strabismus or esotropia,14,32 even

318

though none of our participants had these conditions. Despite the similarity in findings, our

319

analysis methods differed slightly. For instance, because different prism increments are used to

320

measure smaller (2-20 prism diopters) or larger (>20 prism diopters) angles, other authors

321

analyzed and reported these strata separately.14,32 Unlike other authors, we evaluated all angles

322

of deviation together.

323

For both positive and negative fusional vergence, we reported moderate reliability (ICC=0.54,

324

0.66 respectively) for near fixation and poor reliability (ICC=0.49, 0.43 respectively) for distance

325

fixation. These results are contrary to studies reporting lower within-subject variability at near

326

fixation,33 or no differences due to distance.5 Further, we found that negative fusional vergence

327

had slightly higher reliability than positive fusional vergence at near, but were less reliable at

328

distance. However, standard clinical practice and evidence suggests the opposite; negative

329

fusional vergence is considered to have less reliability than positive fusional vergence.3,35 It is

330

possible that the order in which fusional vergences are taken may influence their scores. We

331

measured fusional vergences grouped by distance: (1) negative fusional vergence far, (2)

332

positive fusional vergence far, (3) negative fusional vergence near, and (4) positive fusional

333

vergence near. However, the reliability was poor for both tests at distance suggesting the order

334

of test administration would not explain the discrepancy between our results and the literature. It

335

remains possible that our results are different than others because of slight differences in our

336

methods that are not apparent in the description of the tests (see Appendix for full description of

337

our methods).

338

The test of saccades had the lowest ICC and poorest reliability of all the vision tests. We used

339

the clinical procedures our clinician uses in his daily practice with his patients. Participants

340

assumed a tandem stance and attempted to follow appearing and disappearing lights on a

341

screen under a gap paradigm with only their eyes, trying to keep their head still. The clinician

342

stood beside the screen in front of the participant to observe their eye movements. In some

343

published saccade test protocols, the participant’s head is held still with a chin rest and a

344

forehead support to ensure that only the eyes are tracking the movements.16,30 In the NSUCO

345

oculomotor test, the head is not held still.41 However, unlike other tests of saccades, our

346

clinician had patients take a tandem stance which adds an additional vestibular challenge. The

347

added challenge may influence their performance on the task and introduce more noise. Finally,

348

the evaluation of the saccades was qualitative, dependent solely on the judgment of the clinician

349

with no objective measure.

Strengths and Limitations

351

We selected a seven-day interval between testing times to evaluate the test-retest reliability of

352

the vision tests. This allowed for normal variation over time due to sleep, stress, and other

353

factors in order to provide an ICC that is applicable to following patients over time. In addition, it

354

avoids any lingering symptoms following a test that might lead to an underestimated ICC. The

355

seven-day interval also increased the likelihood the clinician remained blinded to the previous

356

results and facilitated participant recruitment because we could select a day and time when

357

participants were generally available. Some studies previously evaluated interrater

358

reliability.14,17,32,36 Although this has merit when one is interested in tests being evaluated by

359

more than one clinician as what might occur in group practice or a research study, interrater

360

reliability is less important when patients are followed by a single clinician over time. Our

361

objective was to define the expected “noise” when a single clinician follows a single patient over

362

time, as would occur in our target condition (i.e. concussions), so that clinicians can

363

appropriately interpret changes in the vision test scores. We provided results based on different

364

perspectives of reliability. The ICC is a measure of variability due to genuine differences in the

365

participant or due to measurement error. For instance, the ICC was 0.88 for phoria 3m,

366

indicating that 88% of the variability in the measurements was due to differences between

367

participants, and 12% was due to noise within the measurement of a participant. In addition, the

368

95% LoA provides the magnitude of the noise that can be expected with repeated measures.

369

Differences between tests at baseline and after diagnosis of a condition (e.g. concussion) likely

370

represent a true signal of a change in vision tests within the patient if these differences are

371

larger than the noise (i.e. LoA) found in our study.

372

Our study also had limitations with respect to participant population and testing measures. We

373

had a relatively small homogeneous sample size of 20 participants who were recruited via

374

convenience sampling in a university setting. However, our participants did include an equal

375

number of males and females, over half wore corrective lenses, and the age range was 18 to 35

376

years. Our study population was thus relatively representative of our target population of young

377

athletes who may sustain concussions. The approaches used by our clinician were standard to

378

his clinical practice and were used on both of the testing days for all participants. However, the

379

methods he used to assess vision function sometimes differed from testing procedures reported

380

in the literature. For instance, a testing distance of 30 cm was used instead of the standard 40

381

cm distance for near testing of positive and negative fusional vergence.5 The near testing

382

distance of 30 cm was also used for phoria, which is similar to the distance commonly used in

383

the literature, 1/3 m.14,32 However, we are not aware of any studies comparing the effect of

384

distance on reliability. Our clinician did not attempt to separate out accommodative testing from

385

convergence (i.e. near point of convergence and near point of convergence - break, also known

386

as relative convergence) although this may be possible.15 Therefore, our measure of

387

convergence could have been affected by accommodative issues. The saccadic eye movement

388

test of our clinician also differs from commonly used tests in clinical practice and the scoring of

389

this test was qualitative and subjective, which could lead to increased variability and

390

inconsistency in scoring. Developing more quantifiable and reliable testing methods is

391

particularly important for conditions such as concussions, as they are characterized by many

392

symptoms which may only lead to subtle changes that are not detectable with imprecise tests.

393

Conclusion

394

We found that only 2 of 9 BVTs had good one-week test-retest reliability that could detect small

395

to moderate changes in visual function, and an additional 5 BVTs that might be able to detect

396

moderate change in visual function. The remaining two BVTs and saccades may still be useful if

397

changes in visual function are expected to be larger than the noise of the measure.
