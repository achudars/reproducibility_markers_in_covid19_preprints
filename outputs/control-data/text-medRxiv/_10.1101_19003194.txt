ABSTRACT
Objectives: The present study alerts on the potential effect of working full time in a call center as a risk factor
for neuropsychiatric illnesses. It is the first study investigating deeply presence of anxiety, depression, insomnia
and excessive daytime sleepiness among a large population of customer service employees. It has 3 specifics
goals which were (1) document presence of sleep disorders among customer service advisors (2) document
presence of anxiety and depression in this population (3) determine the influence of the socioeconomic status,
duration in position and full time or part-time shift on the diseases above.
Findings: It was found that the majority of people working in customer service are undergraduate students or at
a secondary/high school degree. They worked full time, are single and have reported at least two of the
neuropsychiatric disorders assessed in the present study. Among customer service advisors enrolled in this
study, all neuropsychiatric disorders investigated were present and significantly higher for those working full
time. Perceived socioeconomic status (pSES) was almost similar for full time and part time workers with a mean
score of 4.8 on the MacArthur scale of subjective social status. Results revealed that duration in position was an
excellent predictor of insomnia, sleepiness and anxiety (respectively with R2=91,83%, R2=81,23% and
R2=87,46%) but a moderate predictor of depression (R2=69,14%). The pSES was a moderate predictor of sleep
disorders (respectively R2=62,04% for insomnia and R2=53,62% for sleepiness) but had a strong association
with anxiety and depression (R2=82,95% for anxiety and R2=89,77% for depression). It was found that
insomnia and anxiety are more prevalent for immigrants and international students compared to Canadians,
while depression was similarly higher for Canadian and immigrants compared to international students. It was
found that sleepiness has the same trend in the three subgroups.
Conclusion: Customer service employees are exposed to a continuous stimulation of their cognitive functions in
addition to different stressors which can progressively and silently damage the nervous system. Investigations
on mental and physical health of customer service advisors are worthy of interest, and understanding how their
work, their rotating shifts and their socioeconomic status influence their resilience and their performance at
work; may help comprehension of similar health issues emerging in similar populations with similar
occupations.

1. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, accumulating literature suggests that our modern lifestyle is accompanied by many
stressors such as night work continued flow of news via social network, a low socioeconomic status
,

complicating healthcare or, more often, successive bad experiences leading to anxiety or depression
(Arman et al., 2011; Assari et al., 2016). An important part of this modern age is the possibility to
complete almost everything online or by phone. Even if this evolution makes our lives easier, evidence
suggests that cell phones have a negative impact on our physical health, our socialization and our
brains (Wei et al., 2012; Arora et al., 2013a; Etindele Sosso and Raouafi, 2016; 2017; Etindele Sosso,
2018). Many studies reported associations between lack of physical activity and obesity (Arora et al.,
2013a; Arora et al., 2013b), between poor and moderate physical activity and cardiovascular diseases
(Nicholson et al., 2012; Etindele Sosso and Raouafi, 2016), or development of cognitive impairment
with an excessive use of technology (Shams et al., 2015). The impact of this lazy lifestyle on the
consumer’s body has now been well documented, but there is little to no data available regarding the
health of a few main actors of this new age: the advisors. Whatever fields you are working in, be it
shopping, technical support, shopping, need technical support, ordering, or just seeking some help or
information; there are human beings behind the screen or the phone. Recent research in chronobiology
and sleep medicine reported incidence of some type of work on mental health (Etindele Sosso, 2017a;
b). For example, night shift workers and pilots are exposed to jetlag (Jagannath et al., 2013; Kalmbach
et al., 2015). Nurses and rotating shift workers who have constant flux in their shifts face a permanent
disturbance of their circadian system, experience premorbid psychobiological processes as well as
work-related depression and anxiety (Kalmbach et al., 2015). Owing to the permanent flux of rotating
shifts in these types of jobs, work-related sleep-wake schedules often conflict with internal circadian
rhythms (Kalmbach et al., 2015). Sleep-wake impairments in response to a circadian challenge are
highly variable from an individual to another, but an important proportion of shift workers cannot
synchronize their circadian clocks to their work-related sleep-wake schedules. Indeed, up to 26% of

rotating shift workers develop shift work disorder, which is characterized by persistent and severe
sleep disturbance during the sleep period and/or excessive sleepiness during the wake period
(Jagannath et al., 2013; Kalmbach et al., 2015). The area of customer service is remarkably similar to
those of nursing and night shift workers in terms of rotating shifts, night shift work and volume of
services the advisors have to provide. Regardless of the domain where an advisor is providing the
customer service, responding to so many calls without break during several hours and often with a
significant speed probably takes a toll on the advisor’s mental health after a while. The problematic is
the fact that this topic was not deeply investigated, perhaps non explored at all. This was confirmed by
the difficulty to find literature on this subject in the most popular databases such as PubMed, Scopus
and Web of Science. Currently, there is no data on the prevalence of sleep disorders or what kind of
sleep disorders customer service advisors’ experience during their shifts or because of this job.
Similarly, there is no literature on mood disorders related to working in customer service. The present
paper is an exploratory study which has as objectives to (1) document presence of sleep disorders
among customer service advisors (2) documented presence of anxiety and depression in this
population (3) and determine the influence of the socioeconomic status, duration in position and full
time or part-time shift on the diseases above.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Ethical Statement
This project was part of a larger study approved initially by the ethics committee of research on
humans of the Université de Montreal in Canada, and secondly by the team leaders or human resources
officer of all the call centers and customer services which provide advisors. Data were collected and
computed in an external database. This database was secured outside the public network and was
shared only with the investigators involved in the project.
2.2. Participants and procedure

The customer service’s call centers were contacted during the national career event and the national
job fair, which both took place in three Canadians cities (Montreal, Laval and Longueil) in 2016 and
2017. Study objectives and protocol were explained to the representatives on-site and an electronic
link to complete the study online was provided during the event. Two reminders to participate in the
study were sent by email (two days and one week after the event) to the representatives we met. This
allows us to verify that their companies’ managers approved the study and shared our electronic link
with their customer service advisors. A total of 52 customers services were contacted during the events
above, but only 11 customer services confirmed their participation to the study (response rate of
21.15%). All participants (n=1238, 640 females and 598 males) received the study link from their
administration (from theirs team leaders or supervisors at work). Two contact numbers and email
address to reach our research team and the ombudsman were provided in the first page of the study
online, following a description of the study in French and English on the same page. The online
questionnaire included a consent statement related to data protections and understanding of the study
objectives, which required an acceptance and willingness to continue with the anonymous, online
survey by clicking “I agree”; if participants wished to move forward with the study. The average time
to answer all questions was estimated during our final testing to be thirty minutes. The questionnaire
was configured in a way such it could only be completed once by participants with the same email
address. Responses were collected between November 2016 and October 2017. Duplicates and
incomplete forms were removed (n=38). The final sample analyzed was n=1200 participants/advisors
(610 females and 590 males)
2.3. Measures
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): This questionnaire is widely used to assess insomnia and associated
parameters, including lack of sleep and sleep quality. It was developed by Morin and al. in 2001 and
widely validated and used for different populations and contexts (Bastien et al., 2001; Thorndike et al.,
2011). The internal consistency of the ISI was excellent (Cronbach’s α = 0.92), and each individual

item showed adequate discriminative capacity (r = 0.65-0.84). The area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve was 0.87 and suggested that a cut-off score of 14 was optimal (82.4% sensitivity,
82.1% specificity, and 82.2% agreement) for detecting clinical insomnia. An ISI score between 0 and 7
is an insomnia considered clinically non-significant, between 8 and 14 as a subthreshold insomnia,
between 15 and 21 as a moderate clinical insomnia, and between 22 and 28 like as a severe clinical
insomnia (Bastien et al., 2001; Thorndike et al., 2011).
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS): The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a simple and reliable instrument that
has been used worldwide since 1991. This test was developed by Dr. Murray Johns of Epworth
Hospital in Melbourne, Australia (Johns, 1991). This test assesses drowsiness levels throughout the
day, also known as excessive daytime sleepiness. This test also indicates if a certain degree of
drowsiness may warrant a visit to the doctor and a more thorough assessment to diagnose a sleep
respiratory disorder. The test consists of eight questions (0 to 3 points) and is completed in less than
five minutes. If the participant scores 9 points or fewer, it is considered normal. If the participant
scores 10 points or more, an appointment should be made with a sleep specialist. The Epworth scale
only quantifies subjective drowsiness (interpreted by the participant) regardless of its association with
a sleep disorder.
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): This is a self-administered scale including 14
items, divided into two subscales of seven items (Anxiety or HADS-A, Depression or HADS-D). It
contains no somatic items that can be confused with the symptomatic manifestations of a disease. Each
item is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score is generated for each of the two sub-scales and for the entire
HADS (HADS-T). The scoring is similar for anxiety and depression and following scores, there are
three categories of symptomatic levels: non-cases or asymptomatic ones (scores ≤ 7); probable or
borderline cases (scores 8-10); clearly or clinically symptomatic cases (scores ≥ 11). The duration of
administration is approximately five minutes and psychometric properties are detailed in previous
studies (Bjelland et al., 2002; Roberge et al., 2013).

The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status: This scale measured in this study the perceived
Socioeconomic Status (pSES) with the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status. This scale allows
a self-report of pSES using the general socioeconomic markers such as income, occupation and
education (Giatti et al., 2012; Shaked et al., 2016). The online form showed participants a ladder with a
number on each step, ranging from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest). Each participant was asked to choose a
step of the ladder corresponding to their current feeling about their social status at this level in their
lives. Participants in the present study endorsed values ranging from 2 to 7. Previous studies
demonstrated that pSES is an excellent predictor of health outcomes even after adjustment for
objective SES measures (Giatti et al., 2012; Shaked et al., 2016).
In addition to sociodemographic data like age, marital status, immigration status (citizen, international
student or immigrants), education, duration in position (ranging from 1 month to 24 months in the
sample) and sex, participants were classified in full time workers (from 30h/week to 40h/week) and
part-time workers (from 20h/week to 29h/week); according to Canadian laws.
2.4. Data analysis
The normal distribution of the data was analyzed using a Shapiro Wilk test. Unpaired sample t-tests
were used to compare difference in insomnia, sleepiness, anxiety and depression for male vs. female;
and for part-time workers vs. full time workers. First, linear regression analyses were used to
investigate whether there was association between insomnia, sleepiness, anxiety, depression as
dependent variables; and duration in position as an independent variable. Next, linear regression
analyses were used to assess if insomnia, sleepiness, anxiety and depression could be predicted with
perceived socioeconomic status as an independent variable. Finally, a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey
multiple comparisons of means was performed to analyze differences between citizens, international
students and immigrants in their level of anxiety, depression, insomnia and excessive daytime
sleepiness. All non-significant analysis was not reported. All analysis was controlled for age and sex.

All the statistical tests used an alpha of 0.05 as level of significance. Data analysis was performed
using PRISM (Graph Pad Prism, version 7.0.0.159, Graph pad software) and SPSS version 22 (IBM

Table 1 presented the descriptive data and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. The
sample is almost identical in proportion of men and women (respectively, 49.17% and 50.83%), with
the majority of them having a secondary/high school degree (47.45% for men, 50.5% for women) and
an undergraduate diploma (48.47% for men, 47.37% for women). The Majority of customer service
employees in this population were full time workers (94.82% for men and 89.84% for women). The
majority of customer service employees reported a marital status ‘’single’’ (71.18% for men, 91.8%
for women), while 22.71% of men were married compared to only 6.23% of women. Another
important discovery of this study is the fact that, even customer service employees were mostly
Canadian (44.07% of men, 52.13% of women); the other half of workers were immigrants and
international students. It was found that in men, 30.51% were international students (both with permits
of study or permits of work) and 25.42% were immigrants (those with the status of permanent
residents or refugees). Similar trends were found for women with 13.77% of international students and
34.1% of immigrants. Unpaired t tests were used to assess differences in the level of insomnia,
excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, depression and pSES between full time workers and part-time
workers; and between male and female. The figure 1 reported these results. It was found for full time
workers an insomnia’s mean score of 17 for men and 16 for women (p < 0.001); and for part-time
workers an insomnia’s mean score of 12/28 for men and 15 for women (p < 0.001). Excessive daytime
sleepiness score was an average of 9 for both men and women working full time (p > 0.05), and for
part-time workers it was found 6 for women and 5 for men (p < 0.001). The figure 1C showed an
anxiety’s mean score of 12.5 for men and 11.8 for women working full time (p < 0.001); and 9.8 for
men and 9 for women working part-time (p < 0.001). Figure 1D showed similar mean score of 9.8 for
both men and women working full time (p > 0.05), and a 9 for both men and women working part-time
(p > 0.05). The Figure 1E showed an average pSES of 4.9 for both men and women working full time
(p > 0.05), and 4.5 for men and women working part time (p > 0.05). The figure 2 depicts the
association between each neuropsychiatric disorders and the duration in position for each employees,

assessed with linear regressions. There is strong statistical association between insomnia and duration
in position (R2=91,83%), excessive daytime sleepiness and duration in position (R2=81,23%) and
anxiety and duration in position (R2=87,46%). The relation between depression and duration in
position was moderate (R2=69,14%). Figure 3 showed the prediction of the same neuropsychiatric
diseases above by the socioeconomic status (pSES). It was found in pictures 3A and 3B, a moderate
relation between insomnia and pSES (R2=62,04%) and excessive daytime sleepiness and pSES
(R2=53,62%). The pictures 3C and 3D showed a strong association between anxiety and pSES
(R2=82,95%) and between depression and pSES (R2=89,77%). Figure 4 reported the results of the
ANOVA performed to figure out differences between citizens, international students and immigrants
in their level of anxiety, depression, insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Figures 4A and 4C
showed that being an immigrant is associated with clinical insomnia and more strongly with higher
levels of anxiety, followed by the status of international student and lesser by Canadian born
(respectively F=40.26, p < 0.001; Post Hoc, p < 0.001 and F=16.27, p < 0.001; Post Hoc, p < 0.001).
Figure 4D showed a higher score of depression for Canadians and immigrants compared to
international students (F=3.166, p < 0.001; Post Hoc, p < 0.001). Analysis did not find a significant
difference in excessive daytime sleepiness for the three sub-groups (F=6; p=0.09 > 0.05; Post Hoc, p <
0.001).
4. DISCUSSION
The present research was led to document global health of employees working in the customer service
field. More specifically, the present paper is the first round of a pilot study which has objectives to (1)
document presence of sleep disorders among customer service advisors (2) document presence of
anxiety and depression in this population (3) determine the influence of the socioeconomic status,
duration in position and full time or part-time shift on the diseases above. The results revealed that
people working in customer service are aged 26 ± 4 years old for men and 21 ± 2 years old for women,
with an undergraduate or a secondary/high school degree. The majority worked full time, are single

and have reported at least two of the neuropsychiatric disorders assessed in the present study. Among
customer service employees enrolled in this study, all neuropsychiatric disorders investigated were
present and significantly higher for those working full time. Perceived socioeconomic status (pSES)
was almost similar for full time and part time workers with a mean score of 4.8 on the MacArthur scale
of subjective social status. Results also revealed that duration in position was an excellent predictor of
insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness and anxiety (respectively with R2=91,83%, R2=81,23% and
R2=87,46%) but a moderate predictor of depression (R2=69,14%). The pSES was a moderate predictor
of sleep disorders (respectively R2=62,04% for insomnia and R2=53,62% for excessive daytime
sleepiness) but had a strong association with anxiety and depression (R2=82,95% for anxiety and
R2=89,77% for depression). Then, it was found that insomnia and anxiety are more prevalent for
immigrants and international students compared to Canadians, while depression was similarly higher
for Canadian and immigrants compared to international students. Finally, it was found that excessive
daytime sleepiness has the same trend in the three subgroups. Considering these results above, the
three objectives were completed. First, insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness were found in the
sample, with statistic for men and women on one side; and for part time and full-time workers on the
other side. No previous study reporting these sleep disorders for this specific population was found
until now in the literature. It is one of the main strengths of this paper. Data were reported about
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases of people working in sector with rotating shift (Kalmbach et al.,
2015) and some others showed side effects of irregular shift on allostatic load and mood disorders
(Touitou et al., 1990; Kalmbach et al., 2015; Travis et al., 2016). These studies reported that some
work with rotating shifts like oil refinery operators or nurses, were associated to changes in the
metabolism hormones like melatonin, prolactin, testosterone and cortisol without any apparent phase
shift of these hormones (Touitou et al., 1990). Further evidence also demonstrated that diurnal rhythms
in cortisol, melatonin and HRV are not adapted to night work after 1-3 consecutive night shifts (Jensen
et al., 2016). When a worker experimented during several months an irregular work shift, he finally get

a circadian disruption which was recently recognized a risk factor for diabete, cancer and
cardiovascular outcomes (Straif et al., 2007; Jensen et al., 2016; Travis et al., 2016). Additional
evidence has also linked shift work with sleep disorders, with a proportion estimated by the 2005
International Classification of Sleep Disorders around 2 to 5% of night shift workers (Boivin and
Boudreau, 2014). The findings of this paper confirmed the impact of shift work on sleep, by adding
customer service work in the list of work associated to sleep disorders. It is in line with previous
studies which stated that, individual tolerance to irregular shift work was a complex issue influenced
by the duration in position, the chronotype preference and the genetic background (Boivin and
Boudreau, 2014; Jensen et al., 2016; Jagannath et al., 2017). Few sleep disorders like excessive
daytime sleepiness appear during intermittent night shifts and they are related to desynchronization of
the circadian rhythms, disturbing attention and vigilance of the workers after an unknown period
(Boivin and Boudreau, 2014; Jensen et al., 2016). Obviously, the resulting shift work sleep-wake
disorder affects the quality of life of the worker by creating cognitive decline or mood disorders
(Kalmbach et al., 2015). Regarding anxiety and depression, few studies reported influence of type of
work and type of shift on neuropsychiatric outcomes (Averina et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2010). The
present study is the first which reports prevalence and proportion of anxiety and depression in a
population of customer service employees, and also confirms the existence of a strong relation
between socioeconomic status and mood disorders in line with few articles reporting possible relation
between socioeconomic status and health (Mulatu and Schooler, 2002; Averina et al., 2005; Phelan et
al., 2010; Hawkley et al., 2011; McEwen, 2017; Etindele Sosso et al., 2018a; Etindele Sosso et al.,
2018b; Etindele Sosso and Papadopoulos, 2018; Etindele et al., 2019; Sosso et al., 2019). The present
study alerts on the potential effect of working full time in a call center as a risk factor for
neuropsychiatric illnesses. The findings of this study clearly demonstrated that people working full
time obtained the higher score in the different questionnaire assessing anxiety, depression, insomnia
and excessive daytime sleepiness. Higher score means bad diagnosis for all the diseases evaluated, and

even if the current transversal design did not allow to follow the impact of working full time
longitudinally on sleep disorders, anxiety and depression; findings presented here are trustworthy
pictures of the mental health of the participants who are mainly customer service advisors. Taking in
account presence of rotating shift and irregular shift work in customer service, these findings
document an existing association between work in customer service and neuropsychiatric diseases.
The results also question the role of the duration in position and socioeconomic status as risk factors
for neuropsychiatric diseases for customer service employees. While social factors and
sociodemographic factors may influence health in general (Adler et al., 2000; Contoyannis and Jones,
2004; Chen et al., 2005; Assari et al., 2016; Etindele Sosso and Papadopoulos, 2018; Sosso et al.,
2019) and even if evidence exists on their key role as mediators between socioeconomic status and
health (MULATU and SCHOOLER, 1999; Contoyannis and Jones, 2004; Phelan et al., 2010;
Hawkley et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013; El-Sheikh et al., 2013; Grandner et al., 2013); nobody really
investigated how people working in such field are exposed to chronic stress, and current literature
contains no data on employee’s health of this sector. The present paper draws an interesting profile in
terms of age, education, socioeconomic status, immigration status and duration in position; of people
working in customer service in Canada. This is another strength of the present article, because no other
study examined so deeply this population who is probably also exposed to shift work sleep-wake
disorder and many others neurological disorders commonly found in similar works (Boivin and
Boudreau, 2014; Jensen et al., 2016). Despite previous questions raised by these results and debated in
the previous paragraphs, some limitations exist for this paper. First, the difficulty to know what the
exact role of each participant in their respective companies are. This may be a limit because the level
of stress experienced by a manager is different from the one experienced by an advisor, as showed by
few authors who documented the difference in daily stress of cortisol secretion due to some
socioeconomic markers like education, occupation or income (Harris et al., 2010; Hawkley et al.,
2011; Green et al., 2014). In other words, someone with a high socioeconomic status like a manager or

a medical doctor will have most often less stress and low level of cortisol compared with an individual
with a low socioeconomic status like a garbage collector or a delivery man (MULATU and
SCHOOLER, 1999; Karlamangla et al., 2013; Stawski et al., 2013) and the present study did not
investigate this difference. More research is necessary to produce more details about the influence of
an individual's position in a company on his health outcome. Another limit found here was the absence
of medical history or confounding factors like weight and presence of respiratory disease. It was
reported that excessive daytime sleepiness is often associated to sleep apnea which can be mistaken for
with snoring, which is strongly associated with obesity (Lack and Sweetman, 2016; Tsai, 2016). Some
treatments for anxiety may induce insomnia (Lack and Sweetman, 2016) and some participants taking
these kinds of medication may have been included in this study. Even if this has no influence on the
study's objectives and results, next studies should pay attention on this possible bias which may affect
research where mental disorders, or any other diseases studied are linked to medical history or can be
influenced by medication. In the same order, subscales of the questionnaire were not analyzed in this
case only because it was not necessary for this pilot study; but it will be an improvement if further
research investigates the current findings to see if the same trends arise when looking at sleep quality,
sleep satisfaction or other components based on a different sleep questionnaire such as PSQI.
In conclusion, customer service employees are exposed to a continuous stimulation of their cognitive
functions in addition to different stressors which can progressively and silently damage the nervous
system. Investigations on mental and physical health of customer service advisors are worthy of
interest, and understanding how their work, their rotating shifts and their socioeconomic status
influence their resilience and their performance at work; may help comprehension of similar health
issues emerging in similar populations with similar occupations. For now, here are some practical
suggestions to reduce neuropsychiatric disorders for customer service employees or at least mitigate
the work burden on their brain:

Avoid rotating shift as much as possible: Like explained previously, the stabilization of an individual
circadian rhythm is difficult with an irregular sleep and a fast rotating shift (Canuto et al., 2013;
Kalmbach et al., 2015). It is better to recruit employees working only night shifts or those working
only day shifts. Changing shifts of an individual will create more cost for the employer because of
health outcome employees will develop. In the present study, neuropsychiatric diseases were
investigated but it may be possible that the same employees have musculoskeletal diseases, metabolic
disorders or burn-out; which were already reported as side effects of rotating shift (Canuto et al., 2013;
Kalmbach et al., 2015).
Encourage physical activity during a shift: Many studies reported the benefits of moderate physical
activity on the health, whatever type of activity it is (Bancroft et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; White et
al., 2016; Knapp et al., 2018). It is true for elderly, children or adolescents. It is not a waste of money
to extend the lunch time during a full shift, to allow people to walk somewhere, do a short yoga
session or bike (Bancroft et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; White et al., 2016; Knapp et al., 2018).
Increase part-time shift: like demonstrated in this study, people working full time reported much more
neuropsychiatric diseases than part time workers. According to the diversity of the canadian population
and the different subgroups of participants in this study, the mental disorders found here are not related
to ethnicity, age or some bias; the sample is very representative of the general population. This also
means that results are clearly a warning on the dangers related to the to the stressful environment that
is customer service. In my opinion, reducing full shifts to 6 or 7 hours including a 30 minute-lunch
break may be a good compromise for both the employers and the employees in terms of cost, to
decrease the number of sick day-related absences and to increase work performance
Enlarge the investigation to other countries: Canadian population is similar because of immigration
to other countries like United Kingdom, United State of America, France, Belgium, Australia and
Germany. Customer service is an important part of their economy as industrialized countries, so,

without knowing it, these countries probably face the same neuropsychiatric disorder problems with
their employees. More research in these countries may be interesting and informative.
