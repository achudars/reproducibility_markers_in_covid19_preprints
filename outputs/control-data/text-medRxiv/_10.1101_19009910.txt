Abstract
Objective: Limited evidence suggests integration of pharmacists into the general practice team
could improve medicines management for patients, particularly those with multimorbidity and
polypharmacy. This study aimed to develop and assess the feasibility of an intervention involving
pharmacists, working within general practices, to optimise prescribing in Ireland.
Design: Non-randomised pilot study
Setting: Primary care in Ireland
Participants: Four general practices, purposively sampled and recruited to reflect a range of
practice sizes and demographic profiles.
Intervention: A pharmacist joined the practice team for six months (10 hours/week) and undertook
medication reviews (face-to-face or chart-based) for adult patients, provided prescribing advice,
supported clinical audits, and facilitated practice-based education.
Outcome measures: Anonymised practice-level medication (e.g. medication changes) and cost data
were collected. Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) data were collected on a subset of
older adults (aged ≥65 years) with polypharmacy using patient questionnaires, before and six weeks
after medication review by the pharmacist.
Results: Across four practices, 787 patients were identified as having 1,521 prescribing issues by the
pharmacists. Issues relating to potentially inappropriate or high-risk prescribing were addressed
most often by the prescriber (51.8%), compared to cost-related issues (7.5%). Medication changes
made during the study equated to approximately €57,000 in cost savings assuming they persisted
for 12 months. Ninety-six patients aged ≥65 years with polypharmacy were recruited from the four
practices for PROM data collection and 64 (66.7%) were followed up. There were no changes in
patients’ treatment burden or attitudes to deprescribing following medication review, and there
were conflicting changes in patients' self-reported quality of life.
Conclusions: This non-randomised pilot study demonstrated that an intervention involving
pharmacists, working within general practices is feasible to implement and has potential to improve
prescribing quality. This study provides rationale to conduct a randomised controlled trial to
evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

Article summary
Strengths and limitations of this study
This is the first study examining the role of general practice-based pharmacists in Ireland
and the feasibility of evaluating this role.
• Integration of pharmacists was limited to four general practices, although these were
diverse in terms of practice characteristics.
• A range of medication and patient-reported outcome measures data were collected,
although because this was a pilot study there was no control group to compare these to.

Introduction
The global burden of chronic disease is increasing, with more individuals living with long-term
chronic conditions. Managing patients with multiple conditions (multimorbidity) and polypharmacy
is recognised as a major challenge for healthcare systems.[1] Within general practice, challenges
include the fragmentation of healthcare across the primary-secondary care interface, single-disease
clinical guidelines which do not reflect multimorbid patients, challenges in delivering patientcentred care and shared decision-making.[2] General Practitioners (GPs) may also be co-ordinating
prescribing from multiple specialists and attempting to balance benefits and risks from several
medications. Thus, there has been an increased emphasis on the need to support GPs in the
management of these patients. Appropriate medication use is one area of particular importance,[3]
and polypharmacy has been identified as a major priority by the World Health Organisation through
its third global patient safety challenge, Medication Without Harm.[4,5]
Interventions to improve appropriate prescribing include those aimed at GPs (e.g. computerised
decision support),[6,7] patient educational interventions and changes to care delivery
arrangements, such as staffing models or skills-mix.[8] Pharmacists, integrated within general
practice as a member of the primary care team, may support appropriate medicines use and
provide benefits to patients.[9,10] General practice-based pharmacists exist in a number of health
systems internationally, including Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of
America (USA). Evidence from published evaluations suggests pharmacists in general practice can
have a positive impact on clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure and glycosylated
haemoglobin,[11] and may reduce medication-related hospitalisations.[12] They may also release
GP capacity by reducing prescribing activities.[13] The model of practice-based pharmacists may
provide advantages over a community pharmacy service, including (co-)location, access to medical
records to inform the quality and appropriateness of recommendations, the potential for formal
and informal communication and discussion of the pharmacist’s recommendations, and reduced
fragmentation of care.[10,14–16]
Unlike countries such as the UK, pharmacists in Ireland have not been formally integrated into the
general practice team, nor do they have prescribing rights. This feasibility study is part of a
programme of work that follows the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines on developing and
evaluating a complex intervention. The ultimate aim is to conduct a definitive randomised

controlled trial (RCT) to compare the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a General Practice
Pharmacist compared to usual GP care. Therefore, this study aims to assess the feasibility and
potential cost and clinical effectiveness of pharmacists, working with GPs, to optimise prescribing in
Irish primary care.[17]

Methods
Study design and setting

This non-randomised pilot study was conducted following the principles of the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines extension for the reporting of randomised pilot
and feasibility studies.[18] Ethical approval was granted by the Irish College of General Practitioners
and the study protocol has been published previously.[17]
This study was conducted in general practice in Ireland, which has a mixed private and public
healthcare system. The state provides some individuals with access to medical services, including
hospital inpatient and outpatient care, GPs and dental services, free at the point of use through the
General Medical Services (GMS) scheme. Approximately 40% of the population is eligible based on
household income, with a higher threshold applying to those aged ≥70 years so a greater
proportion of this age group are covered. For people with income levels just above the GMS
scheme threshold, a Doctor Visit Card (DVC) is granted which entitles them to only GP visits free of
charge. The Health Service Executive (HSE) is the main provider of health services, particularly in
secondary care, while in primary care, GPs and community pharmacists are private contractors who
provide services for the HSE. The remainder of the population not covered by state schemes pay
out-of-pocket for their care or may have voluntary private health insurance which can cover some
or all costs.
Participants

The study was conducted in four general practices. Practices were purposively selected from the
national Primary Care Clinical Trials Network Ireland, to reflect a range of practice sizes and types,
from both socioeconomically deprived and affluent areas. Practices were invited to participate by
email (which included a study information sheet, practice consent form and practice profile
questionnaire) and a follow-up telephone call from the principal investigator (SS). Consenting
practices were visited by the study manager (KC) to discuss the logistics of the study and answer

any further questions relating to their involvement in the study. Practice-related costs of
participation in the study (room rental and GP time) were covered.
Intervention components

Following the enrolment of practices in the study, a pharmacist joined the general practice team for
a period of six months working ten hours per week, between September 2017 and March 2018.
Pharmacists were recruited by the research team through an open recruitment process. The
configuration of this time and activities in the practice were agreed between each practice and
pharmacist. Unlike other countries, there are no formal training pathways or programs for practicebased pharmacists in Ireland. However each pharmacist was provided with a Study Intervention
Manual which detailed the scope of activities to be delivered by the pharmacist, based on national
guidance and previous research.[19–21] Broadly, this involved medications reviews (both
opportunistic and targeted, conducted face-to-face with patients or using patients’ medical charts
only), involvement in the repeat prescribing process, conducting educational sessions with general
practice staff and supporting GPs in undertaking clinical audits.
It was recommended that the medication reviews focussed on three domains, (i) high-risk
prescribing practices [22] and potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP),[17,23] (ii) deprescribing of
medications that may cause harm or are no longer providing benefit,[24] and (iii) rational and costeffective prescribing, including use of ‘preferred drugs’ in accordance with recommendations from
the HSE Medicine Management Programme (MMP).[19,20] The Preferred Drug Initiative has
identified a single ‘preferred drug’ within several therapeutic drug classes, based on clinical- and
cost-effectiveness, which prescribers are recommended to use where possible, e.g. lansoprazole as
the preferred proton pump inhibitor. The MMP also provides recommendations on which doseequivalent inhalers for obstructive airway conditions are most cost-effective. Pharmacists used
indicators pre-specified in the study intervention manual to screen the medical records of the
practice patient population and identify potential issues. Pharmacists do not have prescribing rights
in Ireland, and therefore the GP maintained clinical autonomy and implemented any changes to
prescriptions, typically with non-urgent issues addressed at patients’ next appointments and
patients being contacted where more immediate changes were required.

Prescribing data
Throughout the six-month study intervention period, pharmacists collected demographic and
medication data for various prescribing indicators (as defined in the Study Intervention Manual)
relating to adults patients of any age. These prescribing indicators were related to (i) prescribing
practices that were considered potentially inappropriate (i.e. PIP) or high risk, (ii) instances where
medicines could be appropriately deprescribed and (iii) instances where Preferred Drugs could be
prescribed instead of non-preferred drugs. These data were collected whilst undertaking chartbased and face-to-face medication reviews, were anonymised with no patient identifiers, and were
recorded in a pre-defined data collection sheet. eTables 1, 2 and 3 describe the prescribing
indicators used in this study.
Patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) data
Patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) data were collected in addition to the prescribing data
from medication reviews to assess the feasibility of such data collection in a future randomised
trial. In month 4 of the study period, eligible patients were invited to have a medication review
conducted by the pharmacist, and were asked to complete a patient questionnaire before and
three months after this review.
Using the practices’ prescribing software, pharmacists compiled a list of patients aged ≥65 years
who were taking ≥10 repeat medicines. Thereafter, these patients were screened by the pharmacist
and a GP to ensure they were able to provide informed consent and participate in data collection.
Patients were excluded if they had psychiatric or psychological morbidity or cognitive impairment
sufficient to impair the provision of informed consent, a terminal illness likely to lead to death or
major disability during the study follow-up period, or if they had already been reviewed by the
pharmacist. Eligible patients were invited to participate via a letter (sent from the general practice)
and received a follow-up call from a member of the practice administration staff. Following the
provision of informed consent, patients were scheduled for a face-to-face medication review with
the pharmacist. Chart-based medication reviews were completed for those patients who declined
to attend for a face-to-face medication review. Chart-based reviews and lowering the repeat
medicines threshold to ≥7, and then ≥5 medications, were protocol amendments implemented due
to poor response rates.

The baseline patient questionnaire included questions on demographics, healthcare utilisation, and
PROMs relating to quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and visual analogue scale [VAS]) and medications (the
Multimorbidity Treatment Burden Questionnaire [MTBQ] and the revised Patient Attitudes Towards
Deprescribing [rPATD]).[25–27] The MTBQ is a 13-item questionnaire which measures treatment
burden (the effort of looking after one’s health) in patients with multimorbidity in primary care,
while the rPATD questionnaire contains 22 items to capture older adults' beliefs and attitudes
towards deprescribing. Only the PROMs were included in the follow-up questionnaire at six weeks
post review.
Data analysis

Descriptive statistics for general practices and patients with a prescribing issue were generated. For
each prescribing indicator we summarised the prevalence as a percentage of all the indicators
within that category of prescribing issue. The proportion of cases where the implicated medication
had been prescribed long-term (i.e. prescribed for ≥6 months) and where the prescribing issue was
addressed during the study period were also determined (i.e. where a GP made some change to the
medications following the pharmacist’s intervention). Any changes occurring after the end of the six
month study period were not captured. For PROM data collection, differences in outcomes
reported pre- and post-intervention were summarised. For the EQ-5D-5L, participants were classed
into those whose health state improved (improvement in at least one dimension and no worse in
any other), worsened (worsening in at least one dimension and no better in any other), no change,
or mixed change (improved and worsened in different health states).[28] MTBQ was summarised
using median and interquartile range, and by classifying into burden categories (none, low, medium
and high), as recommended by the tool’s developers due to non-normality.[26] Changes in EQ-VAS,
EQ-5D-5L utility score (based on an Irish value set derived from a general population representative
sample),[29] and each dimension of the rPATD were examined using a paired-samples t-test. Data
analysis was conducted using Stata version 14 and p-values <0.05 were deemed significant.
A cost analysis was conducted to determine the costs saved or incurred for changes in prescribing
due to the GPP intervention. This analysis was based on the cost of providing the intervention and
the cost savings realised from the intervention. For each medication change detected during the
study period, the total cost to the health system over twelve months was calculated. This cost
included the publically-available drug reimbursement price (less wholesaler discount),[30] as well

as pharmacist dispensing fees of €5 per item (in line with the HSE dispensing fee structure).[31]
Where medications were amended, the cost difference between the original and new prescription
was calculated. Costs of laboratory tests ordered as a result of pharmacist review were also
determined. Where data on the original and/or new prescription were missing, the mean cost
difference for changes within that indicator was used. This analysis only considered direct costs
relating to medication changes and did not evaluate the downstream savings due to more
appropriate prescribing, such as reduced medication-related hospitalisations.
Continuation criteria

Continuation criteria were used to determine whether further evaluation of this intervention is
justified. These continuation criteria were outlined in the study protocol paper,[32] based on
consideration of the primary objectives around feasibility (including recruitment and retention of
practices, pharmacists and patients) and the potential for effectiveness and system-wide
implementation.
Sample size

Since this was a feasibility study, no formal power calculation was conducted. The recruitment
target for the PROM data collection was 50 participants per practice (200 in total), however, this
target was not reached.
Patient involvement

There was no formal public and patient involvement for this study, however we engaged with the
Collaborative Doctoral Awards in Multimorbidity PPI panel for consideration of the continuation
criteria and input into the follow-on pilot cluster RCT.

Results
Three pharmacists were integrated into four participating general practices for a period of six
months; one pharmacist delivered the intervention in two practices. Pharmacists (one male, two
female) had a mean of 15.7 years’ clinical experience as a pharmacist prior to their involvement in
the study. Recruited general practices were from both socioeconomically deprived and affluent
areas; see Table 1 for an overview of the characteristics of enrolled practices at baseline.

In three practices, pharmacists were based in their own room with their own computer and had
access to patients’ electronic medical records. In one practice, the pharmacist was based either in
the practice administration office with the administration staff or in their own room, depending on
the availability of practice rooms on that day. Tasks undertaken by the pharmacist at each practice
included identifying potential prescribing issues (both those pre-specified in the Study Intervention
Manual and others based on their clinical judgement) and facilitation of practice audits. In addition,
one pharmacist delivered practice-based educational sessions on the treatment and management
of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or type II diabetes mellitus, using an
electronic prescribing tool developed by the pharmacist and a GP at that practice. One intervention
component (management of repeat prescribing) was not delivered by any pharmacist at any
recruited practice, as this process had been standardised and was operating successfully within
each practice.
Medication reviews

Pharmacists identified 786 patients with one or more prescribing issue during chart-based or faceto-face medication reviews, the majority via chart-based review (n=748). The mean age was 69.8
years (SD 14.8), and 65.2% were female (n=513). The majority (649, 82.4%) were GMS patients,
while 42 (5.3%) were DVC patients. Patients were on a mean of 9.5 medications (SD 5.5), with a
mean of 4.7 medications (SD 3.6) prescribed generically.
A total of 1,521 potential issues were identified (Table 2), a total of 59.6% relating to high-risk or
potentially inappropriate prescribing, 9.5% where medicines could be deprescribed, and 31.0%
where a non-preferred drug was prescribed. The most common PIP/high-risk prescribing indicators
identified involved long-term proton pump inhibitors at maximal dose, short-acting
benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, the prescribing of duplicate therapeutic classes
in the same patient and tricyclic antidepressants. Most medications involved had been prescribed
for >6 months (eTable 4). Among the most common prescribing indicators, duplicate therapeutic
drug classes were most commonly addressed (within the study period) following the pharmacist’s
intervention (in 87.9% of cases) while short-acting benzodiazepines were least frequently
addressed (in 11.4% of cases). The most common deprescribing indicators identified were ‘Other’
(this category included several drugs that were no longer required by/indicated for the patient e.g.
quinine sulphate, cyclizine, domperidone, ferrous fumarate and valsartan), z-drugs, antihistamines,

betahistine and bisphosphonates. All medications involved had been prescribed for >6 months. In
relation to medications that could be deprescribed, other drugs (most often calcium and vitamin D
combinations), z-drugs, antihistamines, and betahistine were most commonly identified by the
pharmacist. All of these were addressed by the prescriber through dose reduction or stopping in
the majority of cases, with the exception of Z-drugs which were only addressed in 17.9% of cases.
The most common drug categories in which non-preferred drugs were prescribed were statins,
angiotensin II receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
and beta-blockers. Among all the indicators identified, only non-preferred inhalers and proton
pump inhibitors were addressed (in 75.0% and 24.0% of cases, respectively).
Patient reported outcome measures

Ninety-six patients of a pre-specified target of 200 (48%) were reviewed as part of PROM data
collection. Table 3 describes the characteristics of these patients and their detailed self-reported
healthcare utilisation over the 12 months prior to the study is included in the Supplementary
Material. Sixty-four patients completed a questionnaire six weeks following their medication
review. Table 4 compares patients’ quality of life and attitudes towards medicines pre- and postreview, while the distribution across dimensions and levels of EQ-5D-5L is show in eTable 5. There
was a statistically significant reduction of 0.06 in EQ-5D-5L score (95% confidence interval -0.11 to 0.002), however when measured using the EQ-VAS, quality of life increased by a similar magnitude
(0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.10). Overall, there was no significant change in Multimorbidity Treatment
Burden Questionnaire score post-review compared to pre-review, and the distribution of patients
across levels of burden did not change. Regarding attitudes towards deprescribing, patients scored
the appropriateness and involvement factors higher than the burden and concerns factors, however
neither these nor the two global items changed significantly following the intervention.
Cost data

The total cost of three pharmacists’ salaries across four practices was €31,200. This was based on
€30/hour for 10 hours/week over 26 weeks. Practice-related costs for study participation included
room rental (€15/hour for 10 hours/week) and GP time for meeting with the pharmacist (€70/hour
for 1 hour/week), amounting to €22,880. Table 5 reports the cost-savings realised from addressed
prescribing interventions. Overall cost-savings that would accrue over a 12-month period following
prescription changes amounted to €56,669.

Continuation criteria

All continuation criteria, with the exception of two, reached the threshold of ‘Proceed with RCT’,
including those relating to practice and pharmacist recruitment and retention, and intervention
acceptability, feasibility, and potential for cost savings (see supplementary files, eFigure 1). Those
relating to patient recruitment and retention for PROM data collection were at the level of ‘Do not
proceed with RCT unless problems can be overcome’.

Discussion
Summary of findings and context in the literature

To our knowledge this feasibility study is the first to introduce and evaluate the feasibility of
pharmacists in the general practice setting to support prescribing in Ireland. A large number of
prescribing issues were identified by the pharmacists, however the extent to which these were
addressed by the prescriber differed depending on the nature of the issues, ranging from 7.5% of
those relating to cost-effectiveness (i.e. use of non-preferred drugs within a class) to 51.8% of those
relating to potentially inappropriate or high-risk prescribing. The medication changes detected
during the study period equated to approximately €57,000 in cost savings assuming they persisted
for 12 months. Although this feasibility study was not adequately powered to detect statistically
significant outcome changes, these findings are encouraging and warrant further investigation to
test the effectiveness of the intervention in future randomised studies.
Two recent systematic reviews found mixed evidence regarding the benefits of pharmacists in
general practice to support prescribing, which may depend on heterogeneity in patient population
included (i.e. those with specific medical conditions, or generally at risk of medication issues),
outcomes assessed (i.e. clinical, surrogate, or patient-reported outcomes), and to what extent
pharmacists were integrated into the general practice setting.[10,11] As highlighted in our study,
the extent to which issues were addressed by prescribers differed, with issues of safety (i.e.
potentially inappropriate or high-risk prescribing) addressed more than issues of cost.
There were low levels of changes in cases of non-preferred drugs (based on effectiveness, safety
and cost-effectiveness) within a drug class being prescribed in our study. Non-preferred inhalers
were changed in more than two thirds of cases, however this category was somewhat different, as
it represented a change of formulation rather than other categories which involved a change of

chemical entity, and was also the subject of an audit in one practice. Reviews on barriers and
facilitators of deprescribing may offer some explanations for the relatively low uptake of these
medication changes.[33,34] Evidence that it is often only after a medication problem has occurred
that deprescribing is considered may suggest that cost savings to the health system is an
insufficient motivator to switch medications for a patient who is a prevalent user if no issue has
arisen.[33] Similarly, fear of negative consequences of a change (i.e. potential adverse reactions to
a new agent) is another potential barrier.[34] By contrast, the safety concerns in cases of high-risk
prescribing may have been sufficient to outweigh these fears resulting in higher uptake of these
recommended changes.
There was a low response from patients to face-to-face review invitations with pharmacists as part
of the PROM data collection with a recruitment rate of 48%. While qualitative evidence from
England indicates that pharmacist-led polypharmacy medication reviews are a positive experience
for older individuals,[35] the patients in this current study likely already had high treatment burden
and frequent routine visits to healthcare professionals, given that they were on a high number of
medications.[36] They therefore may have been reluctant to attend an additional appointment for
the purpose of pharmacist review as part of this study. In addition, the burden of data collection as
part of this study and unfamiliarity with the role of pharmacists in general practice may have
hampered participation. The continuation criteria indicated the problems of patient recruitment
and retention need to be overcome in order to proceed with further evaluation of the intervention.
This will be addressed by recruiting patients at study commencement before a pharmacist is
integrated into each practice, to ensure an adequate sample is achieved and to facilitate alignment
of medication review with other routine visits.
There was a significant improvement in quality of life as measured by the EQ-VAS following the
medication review and examining changes across EQ-5D-5L health states indicated no prevailing
pattern of change following our intervention. This was inconsistent with the index score from
applying an Irish value set to the EQ-5D-5L responses, however the use of an external value set
introduces an external source of variance and the values and weighting of different dimensions may
not reflect those of participants in this study.[28] The EQ-VAS captures health more broadly than
the dimensions included in the EQ-5D-5L,[28] and has diverged from EQ-5D-5L index score in a
previous trial of medication reviews in older adults.[37]

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the role of practice-based pharmacists in Ireland
and the feasibility of evaluating this role. We used a range of valid indicators of high-risk and
potentially inappropriate prescribing to guide pharmacists’ interventions and to measure the
potential clinical benefits. This pilot study was limited by its small sample size and pre-post design
in relation to patient-reported outcomes without inclusion of a control group, however this was
appropriate given the aim to assess feasibility. In addition, the generalisability of this study is
limited by inclusion of only four purposively selected general practices. While uptake of pharmacist
recommendations in relation to preferred drugs was low, a limitation of this study is that analysis
only focussed on prevalent users of relevant drug classes, and therefore potential influence of
pharmacists on prescribing in cases of new initiations could not be captured. The cost data
captured was in the context of this research study, and did not account for real-world employment
costs that would be associated with the introduction of such a role.
Conclusions

This study found that the integration of pharmacists, working with GPs, to optimise prescribing in
Irish primary care is largely feasible and has potential clinical and cost benefits. A qualitative
evaluation of this feasibility study is ongoing to explore this role further and inform future research.
In line with the MRC guidelines on developing and evaluating complex interventions, this will now
proceed to a randomised pilot study, with changes to the intervention and study design informed
by the results of the present study (in particular, relating to patient recruitment) and qualitative
evaluation. This will provide further evidence on the role of pharmacist in GP practices in the Irish
context, and the potential of this intervention to help achieve the ambitious target of the WHO’s
Medication Without Harm challenge to reduce serious, avoidable medication-related harm by 50%
in 5 years.[4]
