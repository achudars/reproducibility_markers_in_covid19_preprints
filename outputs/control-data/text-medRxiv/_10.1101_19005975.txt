Abstract

24

INTRODUCTION: Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TART) are a known consequence for males

25

with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. TART

26

are associated with potential infertility in adults. However, little is known about TART in very

27

young males with CAH.

28

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the prevalence of TART in newborn, infant, and toddler males with

29

classical CAH via scrotal ultrasound.

30

METHODS: Males with CAH had scrotal ultrasounds during the first 4 years of life, evaluating

31

testes for morphology, blood flow, and presence of TART. Newborn screen 17-

32

hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and serum 17-OHP at the time of ultrasound were recorded.

33

Bone ages were considered very advanced if ≥ 2SD above chronological age.

34

RESULTS: Thirty-one ultrasounds in 16 males were performed. An initial ultrasound was

35

obtained in four newborns at diagnosis (6.8 ±2.1 days), six infants (2.2 ±0.9 months), and six

36

toddlers (2.4 ±0.9 years). Eleven males had at least one repeat ultrasound. A large proportion

37

(11/16) were in poor hormonal control with an elevated 17-OHP (325 ±298 nmol/L). One infant

38

was in very poor hormonal control (17-OHP 447 nmol/L) at initial ultrasound, and two toddlers

39

had advanced bone ages (+3.2 and +4.5 SD) representing exposure to postnatal androgens.

40

However, no TART were detected in any subjects.

41

CONCLUSIONS: TART were not found in males up to 4 years of age with classical CAH

42

despite settings with expected high ACTH drive. Further research into the occurrence of TART

43

in CAH may elucidate factors which contribute to the detection and individual predisposition to

44

TART.

Introduction

46

Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a

47

potentially life-threatening genetic cause of primary adrenal insufficiency characterized by

48

cortisol, aldosterone, and epinephrine deficiencies, as well as androgen excess. It is an autosomal

49

recessive disorder, characterized by a mutation in the CYP21A2 gene which encodes the steroid

50

21-hydroxylase enzyme needed for the biosynthesis of cortisol and aldosterone [1, 2]. Since the

51

production of cortisol is hindered in CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there is a loss of

52

negative feedback to the hypothalamus/pituitary gland and subsequent ACTH hyperstimulation

53

ensues. These high levels of ACTH in CAH patients have been shown to have deleterious effects

54

and may contribute to the development of testicular adrenal rest tumors (TART).

55

In an individual who develops TART, one would expect the ectopic adrenal tissue to be

56

present from the earliest moments of gonadal development [3, 4]. Testicular adrenal rest cells

57

originate from adrenal cells which migrate with primitive gonadal cells from the urogenital ridge

58

at approximately the eighth week of fetal development [5]. As a result, adrenal rest cells in males

59

may come to reside within the testicles in prenatal life and ultimately reside anywhere along the

60

path of their descent [6].

61

TART are a well-known potential complication of CAH in males. They can become large

62

testicular masses causing compressive irreversible damage to the testicular parenchyma,

63

ultimately leading to fibrosis, decreased spermatogenesis, and decreased germ cells as seen on

64

biopsy specimens of patients [7, 8]. Localizing the position of the tumors and determining the

65

size may help determine a fertility prognosis. Patients with TART also have higher

66

concentrations of steroid production including 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione [9].

67

Identifying the tumor early can allow physicians to focus on treatment regimens to prevent

68

infertility and control potential ectopic steroid production.

69

TART have been reported in adults and children as young as 4.1 years old by ultrasound,

70

with a prevalence of 44% in adults and 21-33% in childhood [7, 10, 11]. At our center, TART

71

have been diagnosed in males as young as 6 years old. TART was detected in 1/9 (11% ) of

72

patients 5-12 years old, and 4/19 (21%) of patients older than 12 years old [12]. Historically, we

73

know that histological evidence of TART can be found in post-mortem infants as young as 8

74

weeks old [3]. However, there is little known about the prevalence of TART in male newborns,

75

infants, or toddlers with CAH.

76

Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of TART by scrotal

77

ultrasound in newborn, infant, and toddler males with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency at

78

a tertiary referral center for CAH. We hypothesized that TART would only be found in those

79

with extremely poor hormonal control in this very young age group.

80

Participants and Methods

81

Study Participants

82

Subjects were recruited from our tertiary referral center for CAH. Inclusion criteria

83

consisted of male sex with classical CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency confirmed by

84

biochemical and/or genetic testing, including newborns (< 1 month old), infants (1 to 12 months

85

old), and toddlers (older than 12 months up to 4 years old). Exclusion criteria consisted of female

86

sex, CAH not due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, or age ≥4 years.

87

Study Design

88

Scrotal ultrasounds (14-MHz linear array transducer) were performed prior to the age of

89

4 years. Testes were evaluated for morphology and blood flow, with particular emphasis on

90

examining for the presence of lesions consistent with TART. Newborn screening for CAH, via

91

elevations in 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), is state mandated in California and has an

92

estimated sensitivity of 98.5% and specificity of 99.9%, with activation cut-offs stratified by

93

weight and gestational age. Newborn screening 17-OHP levels were recorded as a measure of

94

disease severity at birth, and serum 17-OHP and androgen (testosterone and androstenedione)

95

levels closest to time of imaging were recorded as measures of hormonal control.

96

The most recent hydrocortisone replacement dose (mg/m2/day) each subject maintained

97

for at least three weeks prior to the time of ultrasound was recorded. Hydrocortisone replacement

98

dose was not recorded for subjects without a stable dose for at least three weeks prior to the time

99

of ultrasound.

100

Bone age was assessed in subjects when there was clinical concern, using a left hand x-

101

ray to examine for signs of epiphyseal maturation, and read by a pediatric endocrinologist

102

(M.S.K.). Bone age was not routinely performed in our young cohort of infants and toddlers. A

103

bone age more than two standard deviations from chronological age were considered to be very

104

advanced.

Descriptive statistics are presented as mean ± SD.

Results

107

Study Population

108

Sixteen males with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency were studied. Fifteen males

109

had the salt-wasting form and one had the simple-virilizing form. At the time of ultrasound,

110

average hydrocortisone doses were 29.5 ± 11.4 mg/m2/day for infants less than six months, 17.1

111

± 7.4 mg/m2/day for infants greater than six months, and 13.0 ± 4.1 mg/m2/day for toddlers. The

112

average newborn screen 17-OHP for all participants was 424 ± 206 nmol/L (range 73 – 800).

114

Thirty one ultrasounds were performed on 16 males. Eleven of 16 males had at least one

115

repeat ultrasound up until 4 years of life. Four newborns had an initial ultrasound at CAH

116

diagnosis; their mean newborn screen 17-OHP was 395 ± 180 nmol/L. Six infants (age 1 to 12

117

months old) had an initial ultrasound prior to 4 months of age. One male infant was in very poor

118

hormonal control in (17-OHP was 447 nmol/L at the time of the initial ultrasound), but remained

119

TART-negative on two additional ultrasounds at 7.5 and 13.6 months of age despite having an

120

increase in 17-OHP to 1,025 nmol/L, and very advanced bone age (+3.2 SD). Six toddlers had

121

their initial ultrasound betweenn 1 and 4 years of age. One toddler also had a very advanced bone

122

age (+4.5 SD), likely representing substantial exposure to postnatal androgens, but did not

123

exhibit TART on ultrasound. At the time of the ultrasounds, a large proportion of males were in

124

poor hormonal control, with 11 of 16 males exhibiting a considerably elevated 17-OHP of 325 ±

125

298 nmol/L despite being on high doses of hydrocortisone in most cases.

126

Overall, no TART were detected on any scrotal ultrasounds. Normal testicular

127

morphology and blood flow were noted in all subjects.

128

Discussion/Conclusion

129

In this study we looked for the presence of TART in males as young as newborns with

130

repeated ultrasounds throughout the first four years of life. No TART were detected by

131

ultrasound in males with classical CAH up to 4 years of life, including newborns at the time of

132

diagnosis, infants, and toddlers. Despite high serum 17-OHP levels at birth and poor hormonal

133

control in 11 of 16 subjects, including two toddlers with very advanced bone ages, ultrasound

134

screening for TART remained negative in our cohort. Although we did not measure plasma

135

ACTH in the study subjects, it can be inferred that plasma concentrations would be high given

136

the magnitude of the 17-OHP concentrations in many of the boys. Our results suggest that poor

137

hormonal control, or high ACTH levels alone, do not seem to be sufficient to drive the growth of

138

detectable adrenal rest tumors in this age group [11]. However, our negative findings could also

139

simply be a result of an absence of adrenal rest tissue.

140

The prevalence of TART in males has been estimated to be 33% in boys and 44% in men

141

with classical CAH [10, 13]. Although the prevalence of TART is lower in pediatric patients,

142

several investigators have noticed the presence of TART in males as young as 4.1 years, 6.2

143

years, and 7.5 years of age [7, 10, 14]. Futhermore, newborns with CAH have significantly lower

144

cortisol concentrations with compensatory elevation of plasma ACTH levels, which should

145

theoretically promote growth of adrenal rest tissue and lead to development of TART [3, 15].

146

ACTH levels have been previously correlated to the prevalence of TART in adult males [16].

147

One possible explanation for the decreased prevalence of TART in pediatric patients, however, is

148

that a prolonged postnatal duration of exposure to elevated ACTH levels is important in

149

stimulating the growth of TART [17]. The role of ACTH is supported by the finding that early-

150

stage TART can regress with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Furthermore, TART can be

151

present in males with poorly controlled Addison disease [18] and in the ovaries and/or para-

152

ovarian regions in females with poorly controlled CAH [19]. Further research on the presence of

153

TART in ectopic ACTH syndromes (small cell lung cancers, islet cell tumors, etc.) could

154

reinforce the theory that ACTH influences TART theory development.

155

The importance of early detection of TART has several advantages. First, the prevalence

156

of TART in a newborn or infant could indicate a high ACTH concentration in utero, which could

157

provide a CAH disease severity measure. Secondly, TART are a well-known comorbidity in

158

males with CAH and can cause infertility and severe pain due to the compression of the testicular

159

parenchyma. Patients with TART are counseled to consider infertility as a possible consequence

160

and cryopreservation of sperm may be recommended to these patients in the earlier stages of

161

tumor development. While these are consequences of long-standing TART, early identification

162

may aid in addressing the tumor at a preliminary stage as several case studies have reported the

163

use of intensified glucocorticoid treatments to prevent growth and promote regression of these

164

tumors [9].

165

Autopsy studies suggest that the prevalence of adrenal rest cells is variable. One of the

166

earliest reports suggests that ectopic adrenal tissue can be found on autopsy in 50% of healthy

167

neonates and children [20]. Other autopsy studies have found aberrant adrenal tissue in 7.5% of

168

individuals as an ovoid mass near the testes, with 1.5% located close to the rete testes [4].

169

Furthermore, ectopic adrenal tissue during exploration for hernia repairs has been noted in 2.7%

170

of cases [21]. A study of 89 deceased male neonates, without CAH and specifically examining

171

the testes, found that only 4 out of 115 (3.5%) contained TART and only one of these near the

172

rete testis [7]. By contrast, another study found adrenal nodules on autopsy in the testes of 43%

173

(3/7) of male CAH infants less than eight weeks of age and 100% (n=14) children less than 14

174

months of age [3]. This seems to suggest that while adrenal tissue is uncommonly found in the

175

testes, there could be undetectable progenitor cells that require further stimulus to be able to

176

grow to detectable levels. Hence the prevalence and natural course of regression of testicular

177

adrenal rest tissue in infants with CAH merits further research and could yield an increased

178

understanding of the mechanisms that promote tumor formation in some but not others. Overall,

179

a more in-depth understanding of TART in male infants and toddlers with and without CAH

180

could help inform future clinical screening guidelines.

181

Our study results should be interpreted in light of certain limitations. It is unclear whether

182

the lack of detection of TART in our cohort is related to the limited sensitivity of

183

ultrasonography or if TART are simply absent in these patients. Furthermore, our sample size is

184

small with limited power to detect a small prevalence of TART. A larger cohort of very young

185

males with CAH could allow us to better characterize the absence or presumed very low

186

prevalence of TART. Finally, temporal variation in hormonal control cannot be captured with

187

our available serum test results and could result in misclassification of those in good versus poor

188

control.

189

In conclusion, TART can be a clinically significant co-morbidity in males with CAH. In

190

our study, TART were not detected by ultrasonography in very young males up to 4 years of age

191

with classical CAH, despite conditions of high ACTH drive at birth and pre-treatment, and

192

conditions of poor hormonal control while on treatment. Further study is needed to understand

193

individual predisposition to TART, the regression of testicular adrenal rest cells in infants, and

194

the sensitivity of imaging modalities in the detection of TART.
