Abstract (250 words)
Background The recent staging manual upstages Node-negative tumor-deposit positive
colorectal cancer (CRC) from N0 to N1c category, while the development of tumor-deposit
presence is poorly understood. Meanwhile, Kras mutation is associated with progression of CRC,
but its link to tumor-deposit status is unclear.
Method: This retrospective cohort study included the patients with incidental CRC diagnosed
during 2010-2014 in the National Cancer Database and recorded statuses of Kras and tumor
deposit. We conducted multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression analyses to
investigate the factors associated with tumor-deposit status and overall-survival, respectively.
Results A total of 48,200 CRC patients with Kras status were included in the study (25,407
[52.7%] men, 25,648[46.8%] <65 years old, 18 381 [38.1%] with Kras mutation). Adjusted for
microsatellite instability, age, pathologic stage and tumor grade, Kras mutation (versus wild-type)
was associated with tumor-deposit presence (n=15,229, odds ratio=1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20).
Kras mutation was also independently linked to a worse overall survival of CRC patients
regardless of tumor-deposit status (n=8,110, adjusted Hazard ratio=1.40, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.79 for
CRC with tumor deposits, and n=2,618, adjusted HR=1.63, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.28 for CRC
without), but a better survival in CRC with no known/applicable tumor-deposit status (n=457,
adjusted Hazard ratio =0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.95).

Conclusion Kras mutation is independently associated with tumor-deposit presence, and a worse
overall survival of CRC with or without tumor-deposit. Therefore, it may play a role in the
development of tumor deposits and serve as a target for CRC treatment.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer death in
the United States.[1] Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras) is a proto-oncogene that
plays an important role in the development and treatment of CRC. Its mutation occurs in
approximately 30 to 45% of CRC, and mostly in codon 12 or 13.[2-7] The patients
with Kras mutation are unlikely to benefit from anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
therapy, which should thus be applied to only the CRC with wild type Kras as recommended by
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.[8] However, the association
between Kras mutation and patients’ survival remained controversial. A clinical trial showed that
a Kras mutation was a strong negative prognostic factor,[9] while other reports failed to show
any prognostic value of Kras.[10, 11] Nonetheless, the NCCN guidelines for Treatment of
Colon/Rectal Cancer suggested that all patients with metastatic CRC should be treated with the
detection of Kras mutations.[8]

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system
is widely used to predict prognoses in CRC patients and to guide adjuvant therapy. The 7th and
8th editions of the manual (AJCC 7; 2010; AJCC 2018) classified extranodal tumor deposits
(TDs) that lack regional lymph node metastasis as N1c in TNM staging system.[12, 13] The
presence of TDs was associated with a poorer outcome as illustrated by decreased disease-free
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).[14, 15] TDs-positive CRC patients have been
proposed to be treated as stage III and have been shown to be strongly associated with worse
DFS, compared with higher N stages.[16] However, our recent work also showed the upstaging
node-negative CRC with TD (N0 to N1c) led to more chemotherapy and 43% more all-cause
mortality.[17] Therefore, it is not clear how to best classify and treat CRC with TD. The
associations of Kras status with TD status and overall survival of CRC are also unclear.

The purpose of the retrospective cohort study was to investigate the association of Kras mutation
with TD status and overall survival of CRC using a large cancer database.

Methods
The National Cancer Database (NCDB), established in 1989, is a nationwide, facility-based,
comprehensive clinical surveillance resource oncology data set. It is the largest clinical cancer
registry in the world and a joint project of the American Cancer Society and the Commission on
Cancer of the American College of Surgeons.[18] The NCDB extracts data through all available
components of the medical record by certified tumor registrars at all cancer centers accredited by
the American College of Surgeon’s Commission on Cancer. A rigorous program has been
implemented to ensure data quality. Scholars have used NCDB to investigate colorectal, breast
and lung cancers.[19-23] An Institutional Review Board (IRB) review was exempt for this study
due to the use of publicly available, deidentified, existing database (Exempt category 4).

In this retrospective cohort study on the 2017-release of NCDB (followed through Dec. 2014),
the primary end point was the tumor-deposit status, which was dichotomized using the data of
site-specific factor 4. The secondary endpoint was the overall survival. No cancer specific
survivals could be assessed due to the lack of data on the death cause in the NCDB.[18] The
inclusion criteria were all incident CRC cases diagnosed during 2010-2014, with data of Kras
status, which became part of the NCDB (as site-specific factor 9) for CRC in 2010. The
exclusion criterion was no surgical resection of primary tumor (code 998 for site-specific factor
4). We included the following factors in the univariate regression analyses: age, sex, tumor
location (colon versus rectum), MSI status, Kras status, pathologic tumor stage (the 7th AJCC
staging manual, according to the data item TNM_EDITION_NUMBER), tumor grade (high
versus low), race, Charlson-Deyo score, chemotherapy status, and radiotherapy status. A factor

will be included in multivariable regression analyses if its P in the univariate analysis was less
than 0.10. Specifically, MSI status was classified as stable/low (codes 20 and 40) and
unstable/high (codes 50 and 60) because of its potential predictive value for chemotherapy
outcome.[24] Races were classified as non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, Hispanic and
Others according to the data items of race and Hispanic ethnicity. Chemotherapy statuses were
classified as received if chemotherapy data item was coded as chemotherapy (not otherwise
specified) administered, single-agent chemotherapy or multiagent chemotherapy administered as
first course therapy (codes 1, 2 and 3); otherwise as classified not received (codes 0, 86 and 87).
Radiotherapy statuses were classified as received if a radiotherapy was indicated (codes 1-5), and
classified as not received if no radiotherapy indicated (code 0).

We conducted statistical analyses using Stata (version 15, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).
The Pearson’s Chi-square test and logistic regression models were used to assess potential
associations. Multivariable Cox regression models with time-varying covariates were used for
survival analyses, including the factors that had a P value less than 0.10 in univariate Cox
regression models. All P values were two-sides, with P<0.05 as statistically significant.

Results
Among the 514,964 incident CRC cases in the NCDB diagnosed during 2010-2014, 23,265
(4.52%) harbored a Kras mutation and 36,327 (7.05%) was wild type. A total of 455,372
(88.42%) cases had no known Kras statuses and were excluded. Among the 59,592 cases with
known Kras status, 11,392 (19.1%) had no surgical resections of the CRC, and were excluded
because the pathologic assessment of their tumor deposit status was not possible. The Chi-square

test shows that all of included factors were associated with tumor-deposit status (Table 1),
including age, sex, tumor location, MSI status, Kras status, pathologic tumor stage, tumor grade,
race, Charlson-Deyo score, chemotherapy status, and radiotherapy status.

Our multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that MSI (Unstable/High vs Stable/Low),
Kras (Mutated vs Wild type), Age (65+ vs <65 year), Pathologic stage (III-IV vs I-II) and Tumor
grade (High vs Low) were associated with presence of tumor deposit (versus absence), but not
Charlson-Deyo Score, tumor location or sex (Table 2). Univariate Cox regression analysis and
log-rank test both show that Kras mutation (versus wild-type) was linked to a worse overall
survival of the CRCs, but no association between MSI status and overall survival (Figure). The
multivariate Cox regression analyses also showed that the prognostic values of MSI and Kras
statuses significantly differed by tumor deposit status (Table 3). In the CRC with or without
tumor-deposits, Kras mutation (versus Wild type) was independently linked to a worse overall
survival (P=0.008 for with tumor deposits, and P=0.004 for without); However, in the CRC with
insufficient or no applicable data of tumor deposit status, Kras mutation (versus Wild type) was
linked to a better overall survival (P=0.039, Table 3).

Discussion
Here we showed that Kras mutation was more frequent in TDs-positive CRC in a multivariable
model. Adjusted to many prognostic and therapeutic factors, Kras mutation was independently
linked to a worse overall survival of the CRC with or without TD, but not a better overall
survival in the CRC with no known TD status.

The TNM/AJCC 7th and 8th Editions define tumor tissue in peri-colorectal adipose tissue and
lymph drainage sites with no histologic evidence of lymph node residues as TD, which possibly
indicating discontinuous spread, venous invasion or a totally replaced lymph node.[12, 13] TDs
have been reported to be associated with aggressive tumor features, including vascular invasion,
perineural invasion, depth of tumor invasion and regional lymph nodes metastasis.[25-28] The
RAS family of oncogenes was one of the first to be identified as mutated in human cancer.[29]
Ras functions downstream of EGFR and the Kras gene product (Kras protein) is responsible for
transduction of mitogenic signals from the EGFR on the cell surface to the cell nucleus. The
EGFR signals protect cells from apoptosis, facilitate invasion, and promote angiogenesis and
EGFR has been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis.[30,
31] Considering our finding that Kras mutation was independently associated with tumor-deposit
presence and worse survival in CRC, it is possible that Kras mutation also plays a role in the
development of tumor deposits and CRC progression. Additional studies of molecular and cell
biology are warranted to examine such a role of Kras mutation.

Recently, more and more biological and molecular markers are being used to predict the longterm outcome of CRC patients undergoing surgery. One of the most commonly available
biomarkers in the treatment of CRC patients is Kras. Andreyev et al found that the presence of
Kras mutation increased the risk of recurrence and death.[2] Maughan et al showed that Kras
mutation was a strong negative prognostic factor and the median OS in patients with Kras
mutations was significantly shorter than those with wild-type Kras.[9] Some recent studies
suggested that no significant prognostic value based on Kras mutation status.[10, 11] However,
the prognostic implications of Kras mutations in TDs-positive colorectal carcinoma are still not
defined. In our study of a large, national population of patients with CRC, Kras mutation was
independently linked to a worse overall survival of the CRCs with or without TDs.

MSI refers to the hypermutable state of cells caused by impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR).
MMR protein status assessment is recommended by the NCCN and European Society for
Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines for all patients with CRC, especially the patients with
resected stage II CRC before adjuvant chemotherapy.[8, 32] A previous study showed deficient

alone and no benefit in DFS from fluorouracil (FU)-based treatment was observed for patients
with dMMR status.[24, 33] Sinicrope et al revealed that deficient MMR phenotype remains a
favorable prognostic factor in patients with stage III colon cancer receiving FOLFOX (folinic
acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) adjuvant chemotherapy and dMMR was significantly
associated with better survival after recurrence.[34, 35] In our study, univariate Cox regression
analysis and log-rank test both show that there is no association between MSI status and overall
survival, which may be attributable to the use of MSI status for choosing chemotherapy. The
other reason may be that tumor stage, a critical prognostic factor for CRC, was not included in
the univariable analyses.

Several strengths of the study are noteworthy. We used the NCDB, which is a widely used and
validated large cancer database.[18] Several clinical prognostic and therapeutic factors were also
included in the survival analysis, including Charlson-Deyo Score, radiotherapy status, race and
chemotherapy status. Inclusion of these models are expected to reduce, if not eliminate, the
potential biases associated with those factors. Moreover, the large sample size of the study lent
us the advantages of more statistical power and inclusion of more covariates in analyses. Finally,
we included several factors as time varying covariates due to the violation of (constant)
proportional hazard assumption. Many studies did not check the violation of (constant)
proportional hazard assumption in Cox regression, and may erroneously report the uncorrected
HR.

The current study had several limitations. First, as with all retrospective studies, there might be
some selection bias despite the adjustment of many covariates. Second, only about 11.5% of the
CRC cases in the NCDB had data on Kras mutation. There thus may be a potential selection bias
associated with missing data on Kras status. A population-based study is needed to examine our
findings. Third, anti-EGFR therapy was associated with Kras status, but not captured in any
known population-based cancer databases. Additional validation studies thus are needed. Finally,
the interobserver variations in the detection TD, MSI and Kras may exist. Future works using a
centralized laboratory are needed to address this issue.

In this NCDB-based cohort, Kras mutation is independently associated with the tumor deposit
presence in CRC, and a worse overall survival in CRC with or without tumor-deposits. Therefore,
Kras mutation may play a role in the development of tumor deposits in CRC and serve as a target
for CRC treatment, besides guiding anti-EGFR treatment.
