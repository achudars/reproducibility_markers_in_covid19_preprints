Abstract

99DOTS is a cellphone-based strategy for monitoring tuberculosis medication adherence. In a cohort
of 650 Indian tuberculosis patients, we compared 99DOTS’ adherence record against results of urine
isoniazid tests collected during unannounced home visits. 99DOTS had suboptimal accuracy for
measuring adherence, partly due to poor patient engagement with 99DOTS.

INTRODUCTION
Poor adherence to TB therapy is associated with increased risk of death, disease relapse, and
development of drug resistance [1]. Historically, national TB programs, including India’s, have
monitored adherence using directly observed therapy (DOT), often with a facility-based approach, in
which patients visit health facilities, where healthcare providers (HCPs) watch them take every
medication dose [2]. However, DOT raises implementation and ethical challenges for health systems
and TB patients in resource-limited settings and may not result in superior outcomes compared to
self-administered therapy [2].

Digital adherence technologies (DATs) may facilitate more patient-centered approaches to TB care,
by allowing patients to take medications at a place of their choice while having adherence
monitored remotely [2,3]. 99DOTS is a cellphone-based DAT that has been used to monitor
>150,000 TB patients in India’s government program since 2015, including nearly all people living
with HIV (PLHIV) taking TB therapy in the public sector [4]. Dispensing each medication dose reveals
a hidden phone number that the patient calls to report pill taking; a computer registers this event.
HCPs visualize this adherence record remotely to identify, and intervene with, non-adherent
patients. 99DOTS’ advantages include capacity to work with feature (non-smart) phones, relatively
low cost, and enabling of remote, real-time monitoring by HCPs [4].

While 99DOTS has potential advantages, its value for monitoring treatment depends on its accuracy
for measuring adherence. DATs may over-report adherence (i.e., reporting pills being taken when
patients are actually non-adherent) or under-report adherence (i.e., reporting pills being missed
when patients are actually adherent) [2]. We present findings of a cohort study conducted in India
that assessed 99DOTS’ accuracy by comparing its recorded dosing histories against results of urine
isoniazid tests collected during unannounced visits to TB patients’ homes.

METHODS

Ethics committees at the National Institute for Research in TB (NIRT), Brigham and Women’s
Hospital, and Tufts University approved this protocol.

To enroll a geographically diverse cohort including PLHIV, we sequentially recruited presumed drugsusceptible TB patients from 11 TB treatment centers in Mumbai (none of whom were PLHIV) and
five HIV treatment centers in Chennai and Vellore (all of whom were PLHIV). Patients were enrolled
at different time points in the six-month treatment course, during treatment initiation or medication
refill visits. We aimed to achieve roughly equal representation of home visits in the first two months
(intensive phase) and last four months (continuation phase) of therapy, since medication adherence
and 99DOTS engagement may wane with clinical improvement later in treatment. We included
patients without and with a prior TB treatment history, taking Category 1 and 2 TB therapies,
respectively.

At enrollment, we collected informed consent for a baseline questionnaire and future unannounced
home visit. Patients became eligible for a home visit three weeks after enrollment to minimize shortterm changes in 99DOTS engagement (i.e., calling) or adherence from anticipation of the visit
(Hawthorne effect). The exact day of the visit was selected using a random number generator.
During home visits, field researchers administered a structured questionnaire to assess self-reported
99DOTS engagement, self-reported medication adherence, and reasons for suboptimal 99DOTS
engagement and medication adherence.

At the end of the home visit, the patient’s urine sample was collected for testing using the point-ofcare IsoScreen test (GFC Diagnostics, UK). Mixing urine with IsoScreen reagents results in a green,
blue, or purple color change if isoniazid is in the sample; we classified such patients as being

“adherent per urine testing.” Patients with yellow IsoScreen test results were classified as “nonadherent per urine testing.” Isoniazid is detectable in urine in nearly all patients between 6—48
hours after ingestion and undetectable in nearly all patients >72 hours after ingestion [5,6].
However, urine isoniazid test results <6 hours and 48—72 hours after ingestion are variable (the
“gray zone”) [5,6]. We therefore excluded from analysis urine test results for patients whose
99DOTS record only reported doses taken within “gray zone” timings, without doses reported 6—48
hours before the home visit. This resulted in exclusion of 8% of urine test results from analysis.

We classified patients whose 99DOTS record reported at least one dose taken 6—48 hours before
the home visit as being “adherent per 99DOTS”. Patients whose 99DOTS record reported that the
last dose was taken >72 hours before the home visit were classified as “non-adherent per 99DOTS”.
In addition to patient-reported doses (via phone calls) 99DOTS allows HCPs to report doses, which
they often do after calling patients to check on their adherence. HCP-reported doses are
represented using light green in the 99DOTS record compared to dark green for patient-reported
doses. We analyzed 99DOTS’ operating characteristics first using only patient-reported doses and
subsequently including both patient- and HCP-reported doses.

To determine 99DOTS’ operating characteristics for measuring adherence, we estimated the
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy (proportion
correctly classified), and likelihood ratios of the 99DOTS record compared to urine isoniazid test
results as the more rigorous biomarker-based comparator. We stratified findings by subgroups:
PLHIV versus non-PLHIV, intensive versus continuation treatment phase, and patients without versus
with a prior TB treatment history. We used Chi-squared to test for statistically significant differences
in prevalence of medication adherence and 99DOTS operating characteristics between subgroups.
We used McNemar’s test to assess for significant differences in 99DOTS accuracy using patientreported doses alone versus patient- and HCP-reported doses.

RESULTS

Determination of our sample is reported in the supplementary appendix. We report results for 597

patients. Median age was 35 years (range 18 to 83 years), 346 (58%) were men, 334 (56%) were in

the intensive phase, 287 (48%) were PLHIV, and 135 (23%) had a prior TB treatment history.

Adherence (positive urine isoniazid test) for the overall sample was 88% (95% CI: 85—91) (Table).

Among subgroups, adherence and 99DOTS engagement were significantly lower in PLHIV than non-

PLHIV (both p≤0.001). 99DOTS engagement was lower in the continuation phase than the intensive

phase (p=0.02).

Findings for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 99DOTS

for measuring adherence were 70% (95%CI: 66%—74%), 61% (95%CI: 48%—72%), 93% (95%CI:

91%—95%), and 21% (95%CI: 18%—25%), respectively, using patient-reported doses alone. Using

patient- and HCP-reported doses, the sensitivity of 99DOTS increased (p≤0.0001), although its

specificity decreased considerably (p≤0.0001). 99DOTS had lower sensitivity in the continuation

phase compared to the intensive phase (p=0.048). In PLHIV, 99DOTS had lower sensitivity (p=0.03)

and lower positive predictive value (p=0.02) but higher negative predictive value (p=0.004) when

compared to non-PLHIV.

DISCUSSION

In this cohort study, medication adherence was relatively high, including in patients with a prior TB

treatment history and in the continuation phase—subgroups for whom adherence is often assumed

to be suboptimal. However, this prevalence of adherence may not reflect patients’ adherence

throughout treatment, given that we collected a single measurement on each patient using a test

that is positive for any dose taken in the prior 48—72 hours. Studies also suggest that risk of poor TB

treatment outcomes increases even with mild non-adherence (e.g., ≥10% of doses missed) [1]. Our

findings therefore highlight a need to further improve adherence in this population, especially for

PLHIV.

Patient engagement with 99DOTS was lower than the urine-based measure of adherence—reflected

in 99DOTS’s suboptimal sensitivity—particularly for PLHIV and in the continuation phase. This raises

considerable challenges for HCPs in using 99DOTS to identify and address non-adherence. 99DOTS’

negative predictive value suggests that HCPs have to reach out to about five patients reported as

being non-adherent by 99DOTS to identify one patient who is not taking medications, because most

patients who did not call 99DOTS were actually taking medications. Prior studies have found that

suboptimal engagement with DATs is context-dependent. For example, TB patients monitored using

a two-way SMS strategy in Pakistan [7] and men who have sex with men taking HIV preexposure

prophylaxis monitored using electronic pillboxes in the U.S. [8] both under-reported adherence via

these technologies for context-specific reasons.

The specificity indicates suboptimal benefits of 99DOTS for identifying and intervening with non-

adherent patients. When only patient-reported doses were included, 99DOTS missed identifying

about four out of ten patients who were not taking TB medications, presumably because these

patients called 99DOTS without ingesting doses. While 99DOTS’ other operating characteristics

improved when HCP-reported doses were included, the specificity decreased further, such that

99DOTS missed identifying about six out of ten patients who were not taking medications—a finding

that may represent social desirability by patients against admitted to non-adherence when HCPs

contacted them. The positive and negative likelihood ratios suggest that the 99DOTS record provides

only modest (15% or less) changes in the post-test probabilities of adherence and non-adherence,

respectively.

Future analyses should explore patient characteristics associated with higher adherence and 99DOTS

engagement. 99DOTS’ suboptimal accuracy in the current study is limited to a single measurement

and may not reflect effects that 99DOTS and associated HCP follow-up may have on adherence or

treatment success. Rigorous trials are needed to assess 99DOTS’ impact on these outcomes.

In summary, we found suboptimal operating characteristics of 99DOTS for measuring TB medication

adherence in a multi-site cohort study. Our study highlights benefits of urine isoniazid testing for

understanding TB medication adherence and for assessing the accuracy of DATs, especially given

growing interest in these technologies [2,3]. Our findings raise concerns about India’s large-scale

99DOTS deployment, especially given a lack of high-quality data regarding its impact on TB

treatment outcomes. Our findings also highlight an urgent need to strengthen 99DOTS’

implementation, with ongoing assessment to evaluate whether its accuracy—and value for

monitoring adherence—can be improved.
