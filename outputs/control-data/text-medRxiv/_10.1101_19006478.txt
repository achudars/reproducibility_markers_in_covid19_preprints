Abstract
Multifocal/multicentric breast cancer is generally considered to be where two or more
breast tumours are present within the same breast, and is seen in ~10% of breast
cancer cases. This study investigates the prevalence of multifocality/multicentricity in
a cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast cancer from Northern Ireland via
cross-sectional analysis. Data from 211 women with BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCA1 91), (BRCA2 - 120), with breast cancer were collected including age, tumour focality,
size, type, grade, and receptor profile. The prevalence of multifocality/multicentricity
within this group was 25%, but within subgroups, prevalence amongst BRCA2 carriers
was more than double that of BRCA1 carriers (p=0.001). Women affected by
multifocal/multicentric tumours had proportionately higher oestrogen receptor
positivity (p=0.001) and lower triple negativity (p=0.004). These observations are likely
to be driven by the higher BRCA2 mutation prevalence observed within this cohort.
Odds of a BRCA2 carrier developing multifocal/multicentric cancer were almost fourfold higher than a BRCA1 carrier (OR: 3.71, CI: 1.77-7.78, p=0.001). These findings
were subsequently validated in a second, large independent cohort of patients with
BRCA-associated breast cancers from a UK-wide multicentre study. This confirmed a
significantly higher prevalence of multifocal/multicentric tumours amongst BRCA2
mutation carriers compared with BRCA1 mutation carriers. This has important
implications for clinicians involved in the treatment of BRCA2-associated breast
cancer, both in the diagnostic process, in ensuring that tumour focality is adequately
assessed to facilitate treatment decision-making, and for breast surgeons, particularly
if breast conserving surgery is being considered as a treatment option for these
patients.

Introduction
A large meta-analysis of 22 studies, including over 67,000 women, estimated
prevalence of multifocal breast cancer to be 9.5%[1]. Although multifocality does not
appear to be an independent predictor of outcome in breast cancer, the sum of the
invasive foci in multifocal disease may be associated with reduced disease-free
survival, when compared with unifocal tumours[2-4]. Moreover, treatments offered for
multifocal breast cancer vary widely, with some women undergoing multiple breast
conserving procedures, and others mastectomy, with no clear treatment guidelines[5].
Historically, the definitions of multifocal (MF) and multicentric (MC) breast cancer have
varied. Multifocal cancers have been defined as two or more distinct invasive breast
carcinomas within the same breast quadrant, whereas multicentric disease has been
defined as separate tumours in different breast quadrants. Studies have suggested
that in cases of both MF and MC disease, tumours may either share or be of
independent clonal origin [6-9]. Furthermore, published data suggests that MF and
MC disease may have different patterns of behaviour clinically [10]. Due to these
conflicting definitions and the lack of clarity on whether these entities represent the
same disease process, for the pragmatic purposes of this retrospective study and to
avoid confusion, we have considered MF and MC tumours together.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumour suppressor genes located on chromosomes 17 and
13 respectively. They encode proteins involved in the cellular DNA damage response
pathway, particularly DNA double strand break repair[11]. Germline mutations in these
genes predispose female carriers to a significantly increased risk of breast and ovarian
cancer, with up to 80% lifetime risk of breast cancer. Given this elevated breast cancer
risk, we hypothesised that these women may be more likely than non-mutation carriers
to develop multifocal disease. Surprisingly, despite biological plausibility for the
existence of an association between BRCA1/2 mutations and MF/MC tumours, at time
of writing, there were no studies investigating this. Therefore, this study aimed to
investigate the prevalence of MF/MC breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, with
exploration of the clinicopathological characteristics of all tumours occurring in these
patients.

Materials and methods
Data from 252 women with a known pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutation
diagnosed with breast cancer (1994-2017) were retrospectively extracted from a
database containing all known female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in Northern Ireland
(Figure 1). Information about histological tumour type and focality (unifocal or
multifocal) was extracted from pathology records for 211 women, with 41 patients
excluded due to missing focality information (n=30), or because of a diagnosis of DCIS
without invasion (n=11). Additional clinicopathological data was collected, including
age at initial cancer diagnosis, tumour grade and size, hormone receptor status, HER2
status, nodal involvement, presence/absence of other primary cancer. Outcome data
was collected from electronic hospital records, and cause of death ascertained. Data
was entered into Microsoft Excel® for stratification and calculation of prevalence. 23
randomly selected cases (10%) underwent review of the original diagnostic slides by
an independent pathologist for validation of multifocality/multicentricity reporting.
For validation of the findings in the Northern Ireland patient cohort, a second cohort of
breast cancer patients with known germline BRCA1/2 mutations was identified. The
POSH (Prospective Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer) study
recruited young women (aged 18-40) diagnosed with primary breast cancer in the
United Kingdom between 2000 and 2008 [12]. The study methodology (including
genotyping methods) and outcomes have previously been reported [13]. Data on
tumour focality/centricity in the POSH study patients was obtained from medical
records from participating centres.

with BRCA2-associated breast cancer versus those with BRCA1-associated breast
cancer. Thereafter, adjusted OR was calculated using a manually controlled backward

stepwise elimination approach[14]. Potentially confounding variables with a biological
association to breast cancer were entered into the regression model and sequentially
removed until only those with statistical significance remained. Survival estimates
were carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. A p value of <0.05 indicates
significance at the 95% confidence interval throughout. Institutional approval was
granted by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (Ref: 5805). Ethical approval for
the POSH study was granted in 2000 (MREC 00/6/69).

Results
Northern Ireland BRCA1/2 cohort
Of the 211 BRCA1/2 carriers diagnosed with breast cancer (with MF/MC information
available) in Northern Ireland between 1994-2017 90 (42.7%) women had a BRCA1
mutation and 121 (57.3%) a BRCA2 mutation. Mean age at diagnosis was 45 years
(range: 25-77 years) with a lower mean age at diagnosis for MF/MC tumours
compared with unifocal tumours (43 vs. 46 years) (p=0.109). Mean tumour size was
24mm (range: 2-150mm) with no significant difference in mean size between the
largest MF/MC tumour foci and unifocal tumours (24.8mm vs. 23.2mm) (p=0.587).
There were 52 diagnoses of MF/MC disease and 159 diagnoses of unifocal disease.
Prevalence of MF/MC disease was 13.3% in BRCA1 mutation carriers and 33.1% in
BRCA2 mutation carriers. Therefore, prevalence of MF/MC disease in BRCA2 carriers
was 2.5-fold greater than BRCA1 carriers (p=0.001). Clinicopathological findings are
documented in Table 1. The majority of MF/MC and unifocal tumours were invasive
ductal carcinomas (86.5% and 96.2% respectively), grade III (73.6% and 63.5%
respectively), and HER2-negative (75.0% and 73.6% respectively). Additionally,
BRCA1/2 carriers with MF/MC disease were more likely to be oestrogen receptor
positive than negative (75.0% vs. 45.9%) (p=0.001). Furthermore, it is known that
invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is seen more frequently in BRCA2 than BRCA1
mutation carriers [15]. We therefore excluded the 9 cases of ILC in this cohort (7
BRCA2 mutation carriers and 2 BRCA1 mutation carriers), and repeated the analysis
including invasive ductal carcinoma alone, showing that multifocality/multicentricity

remained significantly higher in BRCA2 versus BRCA1 mutation carriers when cases
of ILC were excluded (p=0.001).
Of the 52 women diagnosed with MF/MC disease, 23.1% (n=12) had a BRCA1
mutation and 76.9% (n=40) a BRCA2 mutation. 50% (n=6) of women with a BRCA1
mutation were oestrogen receptor positive whilst 82.5% (n=33) women with a BRCA2
mutation were oestrogen receptor positive (p=0.039). See Supplementary Table 1.
Unadjusted odds of breast cancer being MF/MC in BRCA2 mutation carriers were 3.2
times greater than in BRCA1 mutation carriers (CI:1.57–6.57, p=0.001). Age was
found to be a significant confounding factor in logistic regression (CI:0.22–0.85,
p=0.015). Therefore, after adjusting for age, odds of a BRCA2 mutation carrier
developing MF/MC breast cancer were 3.7-fold greater than in BRCA1 mutation
carriers (CI:1.77–7.78, p=0.001) (Table 3).
At a median follow-up of 9.5 years for the cohort of Northern Irish patients, there was
no breast cancer specific survival difference between women with MF/MC versus
unifocal disease (log-rank p=0.617), and when adjusted for BRCA mutation status this
remained non-significant (log-rank p=0.775)(Figure 2A). Similarly, there was no
difference in survival between MF/MC or unifocal tumours in BRCA1 mutation carriers
(Figure 2B), BRCA2 mutation carriers (Figure 2C), nor was there a difference in allcause survival between women with unifocal versus MF/MC disease (Figure 2D).
POSH study BRCA1/2 cohort
There were 338 germline BRCA mutation carriers in the POSH study breast cancer
cohort; focality data was missing in 37 cases, leaving 180 women with a BRCA1
mutation and 121 with a BRCA2 mutation for analysis. There were 81 diagnoses of
MF/MC disease and 220 diagnoses of unifocal disease. Clinicopathological findings
in the POSH cohort are detailed in Table 2. Mean age of diagnosis was 34 years, with
no difference seen in the age at diagnosis for MF/MC tumours versus unifocal tumours
(35 versus 34 years). MF/MC breast cancer was identified in 26.9% of BRCA1/2
mutation carriers who developed breast cancer. Prevalence of MF/MC disease was
13.3% amongst BRCA1 mutation carriers diagnosed with breast cancer, and 47.1%
amongst BRCA2 mutation carriers diagnosed with breast cancer. Therefore,

prevalence of MF/MC disease in BRCA2 mutation carriers was 3.5-fold greater than
in BRCA1 mutation carriers in this independent cohort of BRCA1/2 carriers (P<0.001).
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with MF/MC disease were more likely to be oestrogen
receptor positive (74.1%) than those with unifocal disease (41.4%). This difference in
proportions was significant (P<0.001). Similarly, BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with
MF/MC disease were less likely to be triple receptor negative (18.5%) compared to
those with unifocal disease (42.3%). This was also significant (P<0.001). When data
from women who developed MF/MC breast cancer was analysed in isolation,
prevalence of oestrogen receptor positivity was 85% amongst BRCA2 mutation
carriers but only 15% in BRCA1 mutation carriers. This difference in proportions was
significant (p<0.001).
The unadjusted odds (in binary logistic regression analysis) of a breast cancer being
MF/MC in BRCA2 mutation carriers was 5.8 times greater than in a BRCA1 mutation
carrier who developed breast cancer (CI: 3.31-10.12) (p<0.001) (Table 3). Adjustment
for oestrogen receptor status gave odds of a BRCA2 mutation carrier developing
MF/MC breast cancer 4.2 times greater than a BRCA1 mutation carrier (CI: 2.12-8.19)
(p<0.001). A similar reduction in the magnitude of the odds ratio was observed in our
dataset when analysis was adjusted for oestrogen receptor status.
Discussion
A systematic review of sporadic MF/MC breast cancer conducted by Vera-Badillo et
al included twenty-two studies encompassing 67,557 women. This study calculated a
prevalence of 9.5% amongst women with sporadic breast cancer (BRCA status
unknown)[1]. It should also be noted that this meta-analysis only includes women with
early stage breast cancer, and only includes studies which provided survival outcome
data, so it is possible that this is not truly representative of the incidence of MF/MC
disease in the general population. Nevertheless, and in contrast, the prevalence of
multifocality/multicentricity in the Northern Ireland cohort of 211 BRCA1/2 mutation
carriers was 24.6%, more than double that reported by Vera-Badillo et al for sporadic
breast cancer [1]. This finding is supported by a strikingly similar prevalence of 26.9%
in the larger cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from the multicentre POSH study.

Our study found that prevalence of multifocality/multicentricity in BRCA2 mutation
carriers was at least double that in BRCA1 mutation carriers in both reported patient
cohorts – a finding mirrored in a small-scale study by Bergthorsson et al[16]. The odds
of a woman who has developed breast cancer, exhibiting MF/MC disease, are over
three times greater if she has a BRCA2 mutation compared to a BRCA1 mutation.
This rises to an almost four-fold increase in odds of a BRCA2 carrier developing
MF/MC disease once the effect of age at diagnosis is taken into account.
Women diagnosed with MF/MC breast cancer were proportionately more likely to be
oestrogen receptor positive and had a lower prevalence of triple receptor negativity in
both the Northern Ireland and POSH study patients. These findings are in keeping with
numerous studies documenting significantly higher rates of oestrogen receptor
positivity amongst BRCA2 carriers compared with BRCA1 mutation carriers.
Therefore, it is unlikely that oestrogen signalling itself drives MF/MC disease[17,18].
Indeed, the large-scale meta-analysis described earlier found no association between
ER status and sporadic MF/MC breast cancer, suggesting that ER activity does not
play a role in the specific development of MF/MC disease[1]. Similarly, although ILC
is seen more commonly in BRCA2 mutation carriers than in BRCA1 carriers in the
Northern Ireland patient cohort, the significant increase in prevalence of MF/MC
disease in BRCA2 carriers persists even when ILC cases are excluded from the
analysis, suggesting that it is not the lobular phenotype which drives the increased
prevalence of multifocality/multicentricity.
Precisely why BRCA2 carriers are more likely to develop MF/MC disease than BRCA1
carriers is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that BRCA1-related breast cancer is
driven by aberrant RANK/RANKL signalling in BRCA1 heterozygous luminal
progenitor cells, coupled with increased DNA damage/defective DNA repair in these
cells, resulting in development of basal breast cancers[19]. In contrast, this has not
been reported in BRCA2 carriers, who predominately develop luminal breast cancer.
Additionally, BRCA2’s predominant reported function is its direct role in homologous
recombination-mediated

double

strand

break

repair[20].

Clearly,

a

better

understanding of molecular and genetic processes resulting in the development of
basal and luminal breast cancers at the single cell level is required. Moreover, given

the apparent predominant development of synchronous but distinct cancers in BRCA2
mutation carriers, the contribution of genomic instability at a single cell level also needs
to be investigated. Finally, given recent data demonstrating activation of cell intrinsic
innate immune responses to the loss of BRCA1/2, the role of early immunoediting in
control of tumours in BRCA1 versus BRCA2 carriers needs to be investigated[21].
This study is strengthened by relatively complete data. Data for all 211 women from
Northern Ireland is complete, with regard to tumour focality, BRCA mutation type, age
at diagnosis, and tumour type. Furthermore, information about tumour grade,
oestrogen receptor status, lymph node involvement, and presence or absence of other
primary tumours are all in excess of 96% complete. The considerable quantity of
missing HER2 status data reflects the fact HER-2 testing was not routinely carried out
at time of diagnosis for many of these women[22]. Additionally, the presence of a large,
independent cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from in the validation cohort
provides strong evidence to support the increased prevalence of MF/MC tumours in
BRCA2 mutation carriers.
With respect to the long-term outcomes in the Northern Ireland cohort of patients, no
difference in outcomes was noted between MF/MC and unifocal tumours, even when
adjusted for BRCA mutation status, although this data needs to be interpreted with
caution due to the small number of deaths in the two groups. Other groups have
reported worse 10 year survival in BRCA1 mutation carriers as compared with BRCA2
carriers, ascribing this difference to tumour biology [23]. However, the cohort of young
patients from the POSH study, which form the validation cohort for this study, did not
demonstrate a significant difference in overall survival between either BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers, despite showing a similar
increase in multifocality/multicentricity prevalence in BRCA2 mutation carriers [13].
Taken together, these data support the contention that multifocality/multicentricity is
not an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. Due to the retrospective nature
of this series, it was not possible to add together the tumour diameters of individual
foci as carried out by Fushimi et al [2]. Although Fushimi et al suggested that doing so
may predict for outcome, this may simply be due to the fact that it reflects a higher

in

There are necessarily limitations to a retrospective review of MF/MC breast cancer,
as much of the macroscopic pathological information available at the time of initial
surgery is no longer available at retrospective slide review. In this study, the
assumption was made that the original diagnosis of MF/MC disease (as made by the
reporting pathologist with all the macroscopic and microscopic information to hand)
was accurate, and a slide review was carried out to determine whether there were any
features to suggest that this original diagnosis was incorrect. Indeed in the 10% of
cases where slides were reviewed there was no evidence that the diagnosis of MF/MC
cancer was incorrect and no cases were excluded on the basis of this review.
Furthermore, data on the number of tumour foci and the intervening distance between
foci in each case, and their morphological similarities/differences, were not available.
Biomarker status (ER/PR/HER2) was also not available for individual tumour foci, as
this was generally not assessed on all tumour foci, meaning that it is not possible to
comment on the morphological nature of the MF/MC disease in these patients. These
limitations are applicable to both the Northern Ireland and POSH study patient cohorts.
In

conclusion,

we

report

a

higher

than

anticipated

prevalence

of

multifocality/multicentricity amongst female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers diagnosed
with breast cancer. This finding was seen in a cohort of patients from Northern Ireland,
and is validated in the independent cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from the
POSH study. Our data also suggests that multifocality/multicentricity is more common
in BRCA2-associated breast cancer. Those with MF/MC disease were more likely to
be younger at diagnosis, and more likely to be oestrogen receptor positive than those
with unifocal disease. These findings have important implications for clinicians
involved in the care of patients with BRCA-associated breast cancer, who will need to
ensure that BRCA2-associated tumour focality is thoroughly assessed during the
diagnostic process. Furthermore, where breast conserving surgery is being
considered as a treatment option for these patients, surgeons need to be aware of the
increased incidence of multifocality and plan surgery accordingly, to ensure complete
excision at one operation and minimise the consequences associated with reoperation due to involved margins. Finally, further studies are required to establish the
underlying mechanistic basis for these findings.
