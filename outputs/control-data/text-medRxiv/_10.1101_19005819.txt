Abstract
Purpose: The Oxford Parkinson’s Disease Centre (OPDC) Discovery Cohort
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study (OPDC-MRI) collects high quality
multimodal brain MRI together with deep longitudinal clinical phenotyping in patients
with Parkinson’s, at-risk individuals and healthy elderly participants. The primary aim
is to detect pathological changes in brain structure and function, and develop,
together with the clinical data, biomarkers to stratify, predict and chart progression in
early-stage Parkinson’s and at-risk individuals.
Participants: Participants are recruited from the OPDC Discovery Cohort, a
prospective, longitudinal study. Baseline MRI data is currently available for 290
participants: 119 patients with early idiopathic Parkinson’s, 15 Parkinson’s patients
with pathogenic mutations of the LRRK2 or GBA genes, 68 healthy controls and 87
individuals at risk of Parkinson’s (asymptomatic carriers of GBA mutation and
patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder - RBD).
Findings to date: Differences in brain structure in early Parkinson’s were found to
be subtle, with small changes in the shape of the globus pallidus and evidence of
alterations in microstructural integrity in the prefrontal cortex that correlated with
performance on executive function tests. Brain function, as assayed with resting
fMRI yielded more substantial differences, with basal ganglia connectivity reduced in
early Parkinson’s, and RBD, but not Alzheimer’s, suggesting that the effect is
pathology specific. Imaging of the substantia nigra with the more recent adoption of
sequences sensitive to iron and neuromelanin content shows promising results in
identifying early signs of Parkinsonian disease.
Future plans: Ongoing studies include the integration of multimodal MRI measures
to improve discrimination power. Follow-up clinical data are now accumulating and
will allow us to correlate baseline imaging measures to clinical disease progression.
Follow-up MRI scanning started in 2015 and is currently ongoing, providing the
opportunity for future longitudinal imaging analyses with parallel clinical phenotyping.

Article Summary
Strengths and limitations of this study
•

High quality 3T MRI data in a very well phenotyped and longitudinally followed
cohort of Parkinson’s and RBD.

•

All imaging data were acquired on the same MRI scanner, quite unique for a
study of this duration. The protocol includes both standard sequences,
comparable across other studies, and sequences acquired to investigate studyspecific research questions.

•

Clinical longitudinal data are acquired every 18 months and will be used to relate
baseline imaging with clinical progression. Information about conversion to
Parkinson’s of the at-risk individuals will also be available, providing the ultimate
validation of potential biomarkers. MRI follow-up is also ongoing, which will allow
longitudinal imaging analyses.

•

Statistical maps of published results and support data relative to the analyses are
available to share.

•

OPDC-MRI phenotyping is deep and relatively frequent, however the size of the
cohort is not at the level of population-level cohort studies. MRI sequences are
high quality, but could not exploit the latest advances in the field in order to
maintain continuity.

Introduction
The Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre (OPDC)1 is a multidisciplinary research
centre at the University of Oxford supported by Parkinson’s UK with funds from The
Monument Trust. It was established in 2010 and brings together world-leaders in
clinical

neurology,

molecular

neuroepidemiology,

genetics,

transgenic

neuroimaging,

Parkinson’s

proteomics,

models,

genomics,

neuropharmacology,

neurophysiology and neuropathology.
The centre was formed to understand the earliest events in the development of
Parkinson’s, ultimately with a view to identifying the changes that occur before motor
symptoms become apparent.
The overarching goals of the OPDC are to:
•

Understand the progression of Parkinson’s

•

Predict the onset of Parkinson’s

•

Identify potential drug targets for Parkinson’s

•

Develop new treatments that will prevent the development of Parkinson’s in
at-risk individuals.

To these aims, the research activity is structured around three overlapping themes:
1. improved clinical cohorts for development of novel biomarkers; 2. improved
cellular and genetic models of Parkinson's pathologies and pathways; 3. novel
animal models of early neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's.
Within theme 1, the OPDC Discovery Cohort is one of the largest and bestcharacterised cohorts of people with early motor-manifest and prodromal Parkinson's
in the world2-4. It is a prospective, longitudinal study that has recruited patients with
early idiopathic Parkinson's, healthy controls and individuals at risk of Parkinson’s.
The OPDC Discovery Cohort is designed by and for patients and is closely linked
with the Parkinson’s UK local support group. Patient representatives are also
involved in the funding/renewal and strategic oversight processes.
The aim of the OPDC Discovery Cohort is to provide a wealth of data to better
understand the biology of premotor and early Parkinson’s, and to identify predictors
of disease onset and progression. In addition to standardised assessments of motor
and non-motor function, there is a particular interest in validating cutting-edge
technologies to stratify, predict and chart progression in Parkinson’s, including brain
imaging, saccadometry, smart-phone and wearable assessments.

The subset of the OPDC Discovery Cohort that underwent brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) constitutes the OPDC Discovery MRI (OPDC-MRI) sub-study and is
the focus of this paper. Driven by the emerging evidence of novel imaging markers
with high predictive value, like the study by Vaillancourt and colleagues5 and others
mentioned in 6, this project started with the collection of a small number of scans.
Thanks to the promising results and to accumulating evidence in the field about the
potential of MRI to serve as a biomarker for manifest (e.g.7 8) and pre-motor
Parkinson’s9, the imaging sub-study was further expanded, with the aim to develop
biomarkers derived from multimodal MRI in order to:
•

Detect damage and changes in brain structure and function in early-stage
Parkinson’s and prodromal ‘at-risk’ individuals.

•

Predict disease progression and understand its neural correlates.

•

Stratify at-risk individuals to identify potential candidates for clinical trials.

In this cohort profile we will describe the cohort composition, the MRI data collected,
and the processing pipelines that we developed. We will then report findings to date
and illustrate our future plans for the cohort.

Cohort description
Eligibility criteria and recruitment
Participants of the OPDC-MRI sub-study were recruited from the OPDC Discovery
cohort since 2010. Neurologists, Parkinson’s nurses, geriatricians and GPs from
participating hospitals in the Thames Valley area (total population 2.1 million) were
asked to identify all idiopathic Parkinson’s cases who were diagnosed by a
neurologist (or a geriatrician with a specialist interest in Parkinson’s) within the
previous three years, according to the UK PD Society Brain Bank Criteria for
clinically probable idiopathic Parkinson's disease10. All participating clinicians are
regularly contacted to ensure screening of incident cases diagnosed since study
onset. Eligible cases were approached by post and asked to contact the OPDC if
interested in taking part in the study. Exclusion criteria for participation are: nonidiopathic parkinsonism, secondary parkinsonism due to head trauma or medication
use, cognitive impairment precluding informed consent, dementia preceding motoric
Parkinson’s by one year suggestive of dementia with Lewy bodies, or other features

. For the MRI sub-study, we

aimed to scan Parkinson’s patients as quickly as possible after enrolment (within 3
years of diagnosis), but due to logistics and patient unavailabilities, scanning was
performed up to 6 years after diagnosis (see Table 1 for details). Parkinson’s
patients with more than mild head tremor or presence of dyskinesia/dystonia were
excluded in order to minimise movement artefacts during imaging. The Parkinson’s
imaging cohort includes sporadic patients (iPD, N=119) and patients with known
pathogenic mutations of the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2; G2019S and
R1441C; N=5) or glucocerebrosidase (GBA; L444P and N370S; N=10) genes.
Please see 4 for further details on GBA and LRRK2 genotyping methods.
The healthy control group is comprised of 68 participants with no family history of
parkinsonism, many of whom were spouses and friends of Parkinson’s participants.
Healthy controls were not receiving any medications known to affect the
dopaminergic system. The at-risk group includes 74 patients with idiopathic rapid

section). Participants with Parkinson’s were scanned in a clinically defined “off” state,
a minimum of 12h after the withdrawal of their dopaminergic medications.
Clinical data
Participants receive extensive assessment in designated research clinics as part of
their participation in the OPDC Discovery cohort. The assessment, performed by a
nurse and neurologist, includes a structured general medical interview, detailed
characterisation of motor and non-motor features, and cognitive assessment (see

2

for details). Patients are followed up clinically every 18 months, while controls only
have a baseline clinic visit. In a research clinic, we cannot formally diagnose patients
who convert from RBD to Parkinson’s (or another neurodegenerative disorder).
However, where history and examination suggest conversion to neurodegenerative
disease, we alert the treating clinicians who then establish the diagnosis and ensure
clinical management is in place. On the day of scanning, an additional UPDRS III
assessment was performed (“off” in Parkinson’s). Table 1 summarises the main
demographic and clinical characteristics of the OPDC-MRI sub-study cohort.
-Table1Imaging data
Scanning was performed at the Oxford Centre for Clinical Magnetic Resonance
Research (OCMR) using a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) equipped with a 12-channel receive-only head coil. The neuroimaging
protocol includes both structural and functional sequences and lasts approximately
45-50 minutes.
Within the allocated time, five modalities were always acquired (core sequences),
while the remaining time was used to experiment with novel sequences, which
changed during the study. We report here the details of two of them, introduced at a
later stage based on new information becoming available in the field, and which
showed promising preliminary results. We describe the other additional sequences
we experimented in the supplementary material.
For each modality, pipelines for preprocessing and analysis of MRI data were
developed and applied to the data to extract single-subject imaging variables (both
summary and voxel-wise measurements). Here below we describe for each modality

the rationale for acquisition, as well as the main preprocessing steps performed on
the images to derive the measures of interest.
The main acquisition parameters and the number of available scans per group for
each of the core sequences are listed in Table 2.
-Table2T1-weighted MRI. The T1w MPRAGE (Fig. 1a-1d) offers very good contrast across
tissue classes: grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
It is primarily used to study GM structural macroscopic tissue in both cortical and
subcortical regions. In Parkinson’s, cortical morphology in cognitively intact patients
is generally reported to be normal or mildly altered, while impaired cognition and
dementia in Parkinson’s have been found to be associated with more severe
patterns of cortical atrophy6 13-15. Non-motor symptoms have been also associated
with structural changes in specific related brain networks (for a review see 6). With
this sequence we aimed to investigate potential differences in GM density across
groups or relationships between GM and clinical variables, as well as taking into
account the effect of structural changes when analysing functional MRI data.
The fsl_anat pipeline was used to perform brain-extraction, bias-field correction and
3-class (GM, WM, CSF) tissue-type segmentation with FAST16. The resulting images
were then used to perform voxel-based morphometry analyses17 and to generate
voxel-wise confound regressors for resting state functional MRI statistical analyses.
Subcortical structure segmentation was performed with FIRST18, obtaining 3D
meshes for each structure for each subject (used to perform vertex analysis), as well
as volumetric images used to calculate volumes or as masks to extract average
values from other modalities.
T1-weighted images with suppressed white matter signal (T1 WM nulled) show
enhanced contrast across the basal ganglia structures (Fig.1e). This allows the
detection of, for example, the boundary between the internal and external globus
pallidus and a finer segmentation of this structure using MIST19 (Fig.1f).
T2-weighted Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). This sequence is
commonly used to detect white matter abnormalities like leukoencephalopathies,
demyelinating diseases and abnormalities of vascular origin. Regarding vascular

pathology, it is used to detect white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (Fig. 1g,1h). With
this sequence we wanted to characterise the amount and distribution of WMH in the
cohort, look for differences across groups and assess the possible relationship with
cardiovascular risk.
FLAIR images were brain extracted and bias field corrected using FAST16. WMHs
were then automatically segmented on FLAIR images with BIANCA20, a supervised
segmentation tool which assigns to each voxel a probability of being a lesion, based
on their intensity in FLAIR and T1 and their location (details and training dataset are
online21). The probabilistic output was thresholded and restricted to the voxels
located within a mask created from the T1-weighted scans (using the command
make_bianca_mask), which excluded the cortex and subcortical structures. The total
WMH volume was then calculated for each scan.
-Figure1Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI). Diffusion MRI is used to study the microstructure of
brain WM in vivo. Also, it serves to virtually reconstruct putative WM tracts. The
basis of dMRI is measurement of the random motion of water molecules (diffusion),
which has a preferential orientation in the WM (i.e. is less restricted along than
across the axons). It follows that the preferential direction of water diffusion is related
to fibre orientation. The amount of diffusion directionality and restriction can inform
about the microstructural environment of a voxel under study.
Diffusion-weighted images were acquired along 60 isotropically distributed diffusion
directions (b-value of 1000 s/mm2). Five additional images were acquired without
diffusion weighting (b=0 s/mm2). B0 inhomogeneity for diffusion imaging was
measured using a dual-echo GRE sequence and the resulting phase and magnitude
images were processed to produce field maps for correction of inhomogeneityinduced distortions.
Correction for b0-associated and eddy current-related distortion, as well as
participant’s movement, were performed using EDDY22. EDDY uses a generative
probabilistic model to estimate inter- and intra-volume movements, displacements
caused by field inhomogeneity, and distortions caused by eddy currents induced by
the diffusion gradients. Additionally, automatic artefact rejection replaces slice dropouts with model estimates23 24. The resultant 4D diffusion data were then fed into

dtifit, which fits a diffusion tensor model at each voxel25 26 and generates maps of
tensor-derived measures to assess WM microstructural integrity: fractional
anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity
(RD). Finally, we ran bedpostX to produce fibre orientation estimates and their
respective uncertainties. This model can be used to perform probabilistic
tractography for reconstructing WM pathways and assess their properties such as
structural connectivity.
Resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI). rfMRI is used to investigate brain function
without requiring the subject to undertake a specific task. Although potentially harder
to interpret than task fMRI, rfMRI is not affected by subject’s performance or
compliance and allows to study different resting state networks, i.e. sets of brain
regions sharing a common time-course of spontaneous fluctuations that have been
associated with specific brain functions27. Among those, the basal ganglia network28
(supplementary Figure S1) is of particular interest for the OPDC-MRI cohort.
In 28 iPD patients we also repeated the rfMRI sequence in the “on-state” 60–90 min
after taking their own dopaminergic medication11.
Firstly, images were motion corrected with MCFLIRT and the six rigid-body
parameter time series extracted for each subject were used for subsequent cleaning.
Mean relative displacement was also calculated to potentially exclude subjects with
excessive motion and as possible confound metric in further analyses. Images were
brain extracted, corrected for B0 inhomogeneities using field maps, spatially
smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM of 6 mm, and temporally filtered using
a high-pass filtering of 150 s. Single-subject probabilistic independent component
analysis (ICA) was then performed with MELODIC29 with automated dimensionality
estimation, followed by automatic component classification with FSL-FIX30

to

identify and regress out the contribution of the artefactual components reflecting nonneuronal fluctuations (FIX training dataset available online21). The pre-processed
functional data were registered to the individual's structural scan and standard space
images using FLIRT and FNIRT32

33

, using boundary-based-registration. Single-

subject resting state networks were derived with dual regression34 and compared
across subjects. The spatial maps used as spatial regressors in dual regression can
be derived either from group-level ICA on the study-specific data11 or using an
external template (for more details regarding this choice see

Figure S1 shows the basal ganglia network map, part of the template used for the
analyses. The full templates used for the studies published so far with data from the
OPDC cohort are available online21.
Regarding non-core sequences acquired in the OPDC-MRI sub-study, Table 3
shows the main acquisition parameters and the number of available subjects per
group for two sequences introduced in 2016, which showed particularly promising
results. In the Supplementary material we provide more information on the other
sequences experimented in this study, which include quantitative T1 and T2
mapping, diffusion weighted imaging of the substantia nigra and multi-echo T2*weighted images of the substantia nigra.
-Table3Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI). The monaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) are rich in neuromelanin, a dark pigment that
gives these structures their distinct colour. Neuromelanin is detectable with MRI as a
hyperintense signal using modified T1-weighted sequences36

37

, which exploit the

paramagnetic properties of the pigment, due to its iron content. According to
pathological studies in Parkinson’s38, the SN and LC are affected early in the
neurodegeneration process39, making them an interesting target for the development
of neuroimaging biomarkers. Studies using NM-MRI found a reduction of the
hyperintense signal on NM-MRI in SN and/or LC in patients in patients with
established Parkinson’s40

41

and RBD42-44. These promising findings drove the

inclusion of this sequence in our protocol.
NM-MRI images acquired in OPDC-MRI were bias field corrected using FAST16 and
the transformations to the individual's structural scan (T1w) and standard space
were calculated using FLIRT and FNIRT32 33. We also defined two reference regions
of interest (ROIs) in MNI space (one for SN and one for LC) and used the average
intensities within the ROI (registered in individual subject space) as normalization
factors in subsequent analyses.
To also extract quantitative information on these images, we developed a
segmentation method to automatically quantify the hyperintense signal in SN and LC
(Figure 2a and 2b, preliminary results in

be available online21.
T2*-weighted images / susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). Susceptibility-weighted
imaging (SWI) uses tissue magnetic susceptibility differences to enhance contrast in
MRI. This is achieved by using the phase image in addition to the magnitude of T2*weighted images. The phase image contains information about local susceptibility
changes between tissues, which can be useful in measuring iron content. There are
numerous neurologic disorders that can benefit from a sensitive method that
monitors the amount of iron in the brain, whether in the form of deoxyhemoglobin,
ferritin, or hemosiderin46. In Parkinson’s, SWI has recently emerged as a promising
sequence for evaluating the integrity of the substantia nigra47. In healthy subjects,
the dorsolateral SN shows an area of signal hyperintensity, corresponding to
nigrosome-I. This feature, described as a ‘swallow tail’ appearance48, is lost in
Parkinson’s, since nigrosome-I is affected early by synuclein degeneration. Given
the promising evidence for the ‘swallow tail’ to be a candidate biomarker for
Parkinson’s, we included SWI in our protocol.
The following pre-processing was applied to the T2* images to obtain the final SWI
image: macroscopic phase artefacts removal was performed by high-pass filtering
the phase images using a 50x50 FWHM window in Fourier space (window size
selected empirically to suppress artefacts in the midbrain caused by nearby aerated
structures). Then, paramagnetic phase components only were taken to the 4th
power and multiplied with the magnitude images.
The presence/absence of the dorsal nigral hyperintensity, the ‘swallow tail’ sign, was
visually rated for each subject (Figure 2c). We also calculated the transformations
from the individual's SWI to structural scan (T1w) and standard space using FLIRT
and FNIRT32 33 to perform group comparisons. To extract quantitative information on
these images, we also developed a method to automatically quantify the nigrosome-I
hyperintense signal49. The analysis on the whole sample is currently ongoing and
support data related to the analyses will be available online21.

Regarding brain structure, we found no differences between early iPD patients and
controls using relatively standard analyses of whole-brain GM volume and overall
regional volumes. A subtle abnormality in the shape of the right pallidus was
detected, and corresponded to differences in connecting WM pathways. However,
the subtle nature of these changes makes it unlikely that morphometric analysis
alone will be useful for early diagnosis of Parkinson’s50.
We found evidence of alterations in microstructural integrity in the prefrontal cortex
that correlate with performance on executive function tests51. This was investigated
using cortical measurements of macro- and microstructure and performing multimodal linked ICA on structural, quantitative T1 and dMRI in early Parkinson’s.
Although these patients were cognitively intact, there were significant differences
between Parkinson’s and controls in a fronto-parietal component primarily driven by
altered cortical diffusion (FA and MD). These were related to cognitive performance.
Intriguingly, the frontal areas involved match the distribution of impairment in striatal
dopaminergic projections reported previously. A study in an independent patient
group found a similar association between frontal WM integrity and cognition,
corroborating the idea of early frontal microstructural involvement52.
Brain function, as assayed with resting fMRI yielded more substantial differences,
with basal ganglia functional connectivity (BGFC) reduced in early iPD and increased
upon administration of dopaminergic medication11. This alteration was not found in
Alzheimer’s53, providing some confidence that the effect is pathology specific. A
similar BGFC reduction to iPD was found in RBD54 and was replicated subsequently,

BGFC and dopamine-related function was present in healthy aging, we conducted a
multivariate analysis in a large population sample of healthy controls. We found an
age-related and sex-dependent decline of connectivity, but no unique dopaminerelated function seemed to have a link with BGFC beyond those detectable in and
linearly correlated with healthy aging55. Our measure of BGFC was reproducible
across different analysis settings35; however, these group differences have
diminished with increasing sample size and have not been replicated on a different
Parkinson’s population so far (unpublished). At the single subject-level, the
discriminatory power of BGFC increased when using a more sophisticated

supervised learning algorithm56, but further investigation is needed to assess the
potential of rfMRI as a clinical biomarker.
Preliminary analyses of the novel sequences showed promising results. Measures of
substantia nigra and locus coeruleus volumes extracted from NM-MRI were found to
be reduced in RBD patients compared with controls (preliminary results in45). We
also found a decrease in NM in the substantia nigra in Parkinson’s with respect to
controls, especially in Parkinson’s with RBD, while the locus coeruleus seems more
affected in RBD, in line with its role in REM sleep regulation.
Analysis of SWI images showed progressive reduction of the nigrosome-1 signal
intensity (swallow-tail sign) from HC to RBD to manifest Parkinson’s in our crosssectional sample. Preliminary results in our RBD imaging cohort show that 28% of
patients have pathological nigrosome imaging, defined as absence of the dorsal
nigral hyperintensity that represents nigrosome-1. Intriguingly, these patients also
have reduced dopamine transporter binding in the striatum, suggesting that nigral
SWI may be able to identify individuals with dopaminergic decline. This MRI method
may have the potential to enrich cohorts for future neuroprotective trials in RBD,
where participants with a high likelihood of conversion to motor Parkinson’s are
sought to achieve clinical endpoints in a manageable timeframe49. However,
longitudinal follow up to determine the true predictive value of SWI will be needed to
confirm this.
Long-term follow-up
These baseline data already represent a rich source of data from a deeply
phenotyped cohort. A key aspect of the OPDC-MRI cohort, however, is the
longitudinal follow-up, which is ongoing. Clinical longitudinal data are acquired in the
Discovery cohort every 18 months, and therefore, we will be able to use them to
relate baseline imaging with clinical progression. This will potentially allow us to
stratify patients and at-risk individuals and predict their progression. Information
about conversion to Parkinson’s of at-risk individuals will also be available, providing
the ultimate validation of potential biomarkers. In 2015 we also commenced the
acquisition of longitudinal follow-up MRI after 5 years from baseline for Parkinson’s
and HC, and after 2.5-3 years for RBD. This difference in time after baseline was
chosen because we predict that a number of the RBD patients will convert to
Parkinson’s, so we aim to collect multiple data points prior to conversion. In this way

we hope to assess their trajectory during the prodromal phase and capture the
associated brain changes.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The main strength of this cohort is the collection of high quality 3T MRI data in a very
well-phenotyped longitudinal cohort of Parkinson’s and at-risk individuals. The RBD
dataset is one of the biggest brain MRI datasets available for this population of atrisk individuals.
Inevitably, a limitation is due to the trade-off between depth of the phenotyping and
size of the cohort. OPDC-MRI phenotyping is deep and longitudinal, however the
size of the cohort is relatively modest, particularly when compared with populationlevel cohort studies.
We are also aware of the inevitable selection bias for this cohort. We recruited
people already participating in OPDC Discovery cohort and therefore our cohort
reflects the demographic of the catchment area. Moreover, our participants are those
who were already participating in a research study and declared they were happy to
be contacted for imaging (self-selection). As a result, our cohort cannot fully capture
the variability of Parkinson’s and RBD patients (e.g. patients with severe motor
dysfunction may be less able to travel and tolerate an MRI scan).
Another key strength of the OPDC-MRI cohort is the imaging protocol. All MRI data
were acquired using the same MRI scanner, which is quite unique for a study of this
duration. In this way all baseline data, as well as longitudinal MRI data will be truly
comparable, with no effect due to scanner and/or protocol change. The protocol
includes both standard sequences, which are also comparable with other studies, as
well as more experimental sequences acquired to investigate study-specific research
questions.
We incorporated a trade-off between exploiting the latest techniques available in MRI
and continuity of protocol throughout the study. While we could not use the most upto-date sequences (e.g. our EPI images - dMRI and rfMRI - are not acquired with
multiband acceleration), we managed to reach a balance by fixing the core
sequences to maintain continuity, while changing the experimental sequences as the
field evolved to include promising techniques as they became available.

As detailed in the previous section, the cohort will be enriched by collecting
longitudinal follow-up MRI data. The challenge will be to be able to get data from
those patients who have progressed quickly and will be in a more severe Parkinson’s
stage. While they may still be able to undergo a telephone interview or clinical
assessment, they may not be willing or able to tolerate an MRI scan.
