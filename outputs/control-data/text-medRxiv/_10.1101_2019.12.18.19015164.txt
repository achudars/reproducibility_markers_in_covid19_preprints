ABSTRACT

38

Importance: In light of increasing cannabis use among pregnant women, the Surgeon General of

39

the United States issued an advisory against the use of marijuana during pregnancy on August

40

29th, 2019.

41

Objective: To determine whether cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with adverse

42

outcomes among offspring.

43

Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the baseline session of the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent

44

Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study.

45

Setting: Data were collected from 22 sites across the United States between 2016 and 2018.

46

Participants: Children ages 9-11 (n=11,489) and their parent or caregiver.

47

Exposure: Prenatal marijuana exposure prior to and following maternal knowledge of

48

pregnancy.

49

Main Outcomes and Measures: Child psychopathology symptomatology (i.e., psychotic-like

50

experiences and internalizing, externalizing, attention, thought, and social problems), cognition,

51

sleep, birth weight, gestational age at birth, body mass index (BMI), and brain structure (i.e.,

52

total intracranial volume, white matter volume, gray matter volume). Covariates included

53

familial (e.g., income, familial psychopathology), pregnancy (e.g., prenatal vitamin use, whether

54

the pregnancy was planned), and child (e.g., birth weight, substance use) variables.

55

Results: Among 11,489 children (age 9.9±0.6 years; 47.78% female), 655 (5.70%) were

56

prenatally exposed to cannabis in total. Marijuana use prior to (n=648; 5.64%) and following

57

(n=242; 2.11%) maternal knowledge of pregnancy were associated with increased offspring

58

psychopathology characteristics (i.e., psychotic-like experiences and internalizing, externalizing,

59

attention, thought, social, and sleep problems) and BMI as well as reduced cognition, birth

weight, and brain structure (i.e., total white and gray mater volumes; all psfdr<.007), but not

61

gestational age at birth. Exposure following maternal knowledge of pregnancy remained

62

significantly associated with psychopathology, cognition, and birth weight outcomes when

63

including potentially confounding variables (all ps<0.046). All associations with exposure prior

64

to maternal knowledge of pregnancy were nonsignificant when considering potentially

65

confounding variables (all ps>0.06).

66

Conclusions and Relevance: Prenatal cannabis exposure, and its correlated factors, may

67

increase risk for psychopathology and reduced cognition during middle childhood as well as

68

reduced birthweight. Consistent with recent recommendations by the Surgeon General,

69

marijuana use during pregnancy should be discouraged.

INTRODUCTION

73

Alongside increasingly permissive sociocultural attitudes and laws surrounding cannabis,1 past

74

month use among pregnant women increased by 106% from 2002(3.4%) to 2017(7.0%) in the

75

United States.2 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, crosses

76

the placenta3 and interfaces with the endocannabinoid system, which critically influences neural

77

development.3-5 Thus, it is plausible that cannabis use during pregnancy may impact offspring.

78

Indeed, the alarming increase of cannabis use among pregnant mothers,2,6-8 and evidence linking

79

prenatal exposure to adverse outcomes in children9-13 prompted the Surgeon General of the

80

United States to release an advisory against cannabis use during pregnancy and breastfeeding on

81

August 29th 2019.14

82

Despite the increasing prevalence of prenatal cannabis exposure, there have been

83

relatively few investigations of its association with child outcomes. These studies have found

84

evidence linking prenatal marijuana exposure to reduced birth weight15 and cognition16,17 as well

85

as heightened risk for premature birth,18 psychopathology (i.e., psychosis, internalizing,

86

externalizing)19-21 and sleep problems22 among children. However, there has been limited cross-

87

study replication,e.g.,23-25 and studies have typically been unable to account for other potential

88

confounding factors (e.g., maternal education, prenatal vitamin usage, child substance use,

89

familial risk), leaving it possible that associations between prenatal marijuana exposure and

90

negative outcomes among children may not be independent of them. Indeed, the National

91

Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently concluded that only reduced birth

92

weight has been robustly linked to prenatal cannabis exposure.13

93
94

Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (data
release 2.0.1) of 11,875 children, we test whether prenatal marijuana exposure before and after

95

maternal knowledge of pregnancy is associated with psychopathology (i.e., internalizing,

96

externalizing, attention, thought and social problems, psychotic-like experiences), sleep,

97

cognition, birth weight, premature birth, body mass index (BMI), and gross brain structure (i.e.,

98

white and gray matter volumes as well as intracranial volume). This represents a comprehensive

99

extension of our prior investigation of prenatal cannabis exposure and psychotic-like experiences

100

among the initial ABCD data release (n=4,361).26 We hypothesized that prenatal marijuana

101

exposure before and after maternal knowledge of pregnancy would be associated with greater

102

risk for psychopathology, premature birth, and sleep problems, as well as reduced cognition,

103

birth weight, BMI, and brain structure metrics when not considering potentially confounding

104

variables. However, given that endocannabinoid receptors are not expressed in the fetus until 5-6

105

weeks9,27,28 which roughly corresponds to when, in this study, mothers learned that they were

106

pregnant (6.91 ± 6.75 weeks), we hypothesized that these associations would only be robust to

107

the inclusion of potentially confounding covariates when marijuana use occurred following

108

maternal knowledge of pregnancy.

METHODS

113

Participants

114

Data came from children (n=11,875; Mage = 9.9±0.6 years; 47.85% girls; 74.13% White), born

115

between 2005 and 2009 to 9,987 mothers through 10,801 pregnancies, who completed the

116

baseline session of the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)

117

study (data release 2.0.1; https://abcdstudy.org/).29 The study includes a family-based design in

118

which twin (n=2,108), triplet (n=30), non-twin siblings (n=1,589), and singletons (n=8,148) were

119

recruited. All parents/caregivers (85.3% biological mothers)a and children provided written

120

informed consent and verbal assent, respectively, to a research protocol approved by the

121

institutional review board at each data collection site (n=22)b throughout the United States

122

(https://abcdstudy.org/sites/abcd-sites.html). For our analyses, only data from participants with

123

non-missing data on prenatal cannabis exposure were included (n=11,489 [87.6% of

124

parent/caregivers were biological mothers]; Mage = 9.9±0.6 years; 47.78% girls; 74.76% self-

125

reported White; 2,072 twins, 30 triplets, 1,523 non-twin siblings, 7,864 singletons; Table 1).

132

Psychotic-like experiences. The total score of the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child Version

133

(PQ-BC)30,31 was used to assess child-reported psychotic-like experiences (PLEs). Higher scores

134

indicate more PLEs.

135
136

Internalizing, Externalizing, Attention, Thought, and Social Problems. The Child Behavior

137

Checklist (CBCL)32 was used to assess broad spectrum internalizing (INT) and externalizing

138

(EXT) as well as attention (ATN), thought (THT), and social (SOC) problems in children

139

according to parent/caregiver report. Higher scores are reflective of more problems.

140
141

Sleep Problems. The total score of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC)33 was used

142

to assess parent/caregiver-reported sleep problems in children. Higher scores reflect more sleep

143

problems.

144
145

Cognition. The National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery–Total Cognition

146

Composite34 indexed child cognitive ability. Higher scores are reflective of greater cognitive

147

performance.

148
149

Gestational Age at Birth, Birth Weight and Body Mass Index. A parent/caregiver

150

retrospectively reported their child’s gestational age at birth in weeks and birth weight. BMI was

151

calculated using measured height and weight at the baseline assessment.

Brain Structure: Total Intracranial, White Matter, and Gray Matter Volumes. Freesurfer

154

v5.3 was used to estimate total intracranial volume (ICV), gray matter volume (GMV), and white

155

matter volume (WMV).

156
157

Covariates. The following variables were dummy coded: race/ethnicity, family history of

158

psychopathology, prenatal exposure to tobacco or alcohol before or after maternal knowledge of

159

pregnancy, unplanned pregnancy, prenatal vitamin usage, child alcohol try, child tobacco try,

160

child self-reported gender, and twin/triplet status. Annual household income was treated as a 5-

161

level categorical variable. The following continuous covariates were included: birthweight,

162

maternal age at birth, gestational age when pregnancy was discovered (weeks), child age, and

163

maternal education (years). Total intracranial volume was further included as a covariate only in

164

models with gray and white matter volumes as outcomes. Polygenic scores (PGS) for

165

schizophrenia, educational attainment, birthweight, and cannabis use as well as ancestrally-

166

informative principal components (n=10) were included as covariates in post-hoc analyses within

167

the genomically-confirmed European ancestry subsample (Statistical Analyses; Supplement).

168

Non-prevalent substance use among children (n=80) or by women while they were

169

pregnant (n=185) as well as extreme premature birth (n=148), and non-biological mother

170

parent/caregiver report (n=1,427) were not included as covariates; we conducted post hoc

171

analyses excluding individuals on these variables (Supplement).

177

family membership for all non-imaging analyses and scanner and family for all imaging

178

analyses, with the lme4 package in Rv3.6.0.35

179

We examined the association between prenatal cannabis exposure before and after

180

maternal knowledge of pregnancy (each coded 0/1 separately) and outcomes using three analytic

181

approaches. First, we tested whether prenatal marijuana exposure prior to and after maternal

182

knowledge were associated with outcomes of interest in independent nested mixed models with

183

no fixed effect covariates. We adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini Hochberg false

184

discovery rate correction (fdrBH). Second, for any associations that were significant after multiple

185

testing correction, we examined whether they were robust to the inclusion of potentially

186

confounding covariates; here, we simultaneously entered prenatal marijuana use before and after

187

maternal knowledge of pregnancy alongside the covariates described above (except genomic

188

data). To address concerns of overfitting, we reran all analyses including only covariates that

189

were significantly associated with the outcome (Supplement). We conducted post hoc analyses

190

to examine subcomponents of significant associations (i.e., CBCL INT and EXT subscales,

191

cognition subcomponents; Supplement). Third and finally, to account for the possible

192

confounding effects of genomic liability to offspring outcomes not accounted for by familial

193

history, we examined whether associations remained significant when accounting for polygenic

194

scores (PGS) derived using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs)

195

of related outcomes (Supplement).36 Here, we evaluated whether any associations robust to

196

covariate inclusion were present in the subsample of individuals with genomically-confirmed

197

European ancestry (n=4,644) to ensure that any differences could not be attributable to power

198

reductions, before examining whether these associations were robust to the inclusion of GWAS-

RESULTS

205

Among 11,489 children (mean [SD]: age, 9.9 [0.6] years; 5,488 [47.78%] girls), 655 (5.85%) were

206

prenatally exposed to marijuana (Table 1). Of these, 413 were exposed only before maternal

207

knowledge of pregnancy while 235 were exposed both before and after maternal knowledge, and 7

208

only after maternal knowledge. Mothers learned of their pregnancy at 6.91 ± 6.75 weeks. Rates of

209

tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy, prior to and following maternal knowledge of

210

pregnancy, were higher than cannabis use (Table 1) and modestly correlated with prenatal

211

marijuana exposure (rss 0.11-0.34; Supplemental eTable 1).

212
213

Prenatal Cannabis Exposure After Maternal Knowledge of Pregnancy

214

Prenatal marijuana exposure after maternal knowledge of pregnancy was significantly associated

215

with higher PLEs, BMI and internalizing, externalizing, attention, thought, social, and sleep

216

problems, as well as lower cognition, birth weight, and intracranial and gray and white matter

217

volumes (all |Bs|>0.27, all psfdr<0.002; Table 2), but not gestational age at birth (B=0.14,

218

pfdr=0.271). PLEs, birth weight, and cognition, as well as internalizing, externalizing, attention,

219

thought, and social problems, remained significantly associated even after accounting for

220

potentially confounding covariates (all |Bs|>0.52, all ps<0.046), but sleep problems, BMI, and total

221

intracranial, gray matter, and white matter volumes were not (all |Bs|<0.87, ps>0.27; Figure 1;

222

Table 3; Supplemental eTables 2-8). Post hoc analyses showed globally similar associations

223

across subfacets of EXT, but not INT or cognition (Supplemental eTable 9).

224

Stepwise analyses of confounding covariates revealed that reductions in significance could

225

not generally be attributed to a small collection of variables (Supplement). Post Hoc Analyses

226

excluding: children who engaged in non-prevalent substance use, were exposed to other illicit

substances prenatally, were born at extreme levels of prematurity, or whose biological mothers were

228

not the parent/caregiver respondent revealed similar associations and consistent conclusions

229

(Supplemental eTable 10-13). Finally, in the subsample of children with genomically-confirmed

230

European ancestry (N=4,644; 3.94% reporting any prenatal exposure), PLEs, social problems, and

231

birth weight remained significantly associated with prenatal exposure to cannabis after maternal

232

knowledge of pregnancy even after accounting for covariates (all |Bs|>0.97, all ps<0.016;

233

Supplemental eTable 14) and when further accounting for child PGS for schizophrenia,

234

educational attainment, birth weight, and/or cannabis use (|Bs|>0.95, all ps<0.018; Supplemental

235

eTables 15-18).

236
237

Prenatal Cannabis Exposure Prior to Maternal Knowledge of Pregnancy

238

Prenatal marijuana exposure prior to maternal knowledge of pregnancy was significantly associated

239

with all outcomes (all |Bs|>0.15, all psfdr<7.0*10-3) except gestational age at birth (B=0.076,

240

pfdr=0.334; Table 2). No associations remained significant after accounting for potentially

241

confounding covariates, but a nominal trend for increased (directionally opposite to results without

242

covariates) cognition emerged (Table 3; Supplemental eTables 2-8). Stepwise analysis of

243

confounding covariates revealed that no small group of covariates was responsible for attenuating

244

these associations (but see Attention and Thought problems; Supplemental eResults).

DISCUSSION

249

Prenatal cannabis exposure following maternal knowledge of pregnancy is associated with

250

elevated psychopathology risk and reduced cognition during middle childhood as well as reduced

251

birth weight (Tables 2-3). That these associations were robust to the inclusion of potentially

252

confounding variables increases the plausibility that prenatal cannabis exposure may

253

independently contribute to the development of behavioral problems in children. In contrast to

254

increasingly permissive attitudes surrounding marijuana use among pregnant mothers,41 and

255

recommendations by dispensaries to use marijuana to combat pregnancy-related nausea,42 these

256

findings align with recent recommendations by the Surgeon General14 and raise concern

257

surrounding the potential impact of in utero exposure to marijuana on mental health and

258

cognitive outcomes in children.

259

All studied outcomes, except gestational age at birth, were associated with prenatal

260

exposure before and after maternal knowledge of pregnancy (Table 2); however, only

261

associations between prenatal exposure post-maternal knowledge of pregnancy and child

262

psychopathology, cognition, and birth weight were robust to covariate inclusion (Table 3). There

263

are several potential non-mutually exclusive explanations for these findings. First,

264

endocannabinoid system ontogeny and signaling may play a role. Endocannabinoid type 1

265

receptors (CB1Rs), which non-human animal data suggest are critical for THC’s impact on the

266

developing brain,43 are not known to be expressed before the equivalent of 5 to 6 weeks gestation

267

in humans.9 As such, independent effects of cannabis on behavioral outcomes in children may

268

only arise when sufficient CB1Rs are present in the fetus, which may not occur until after many

269

women learn they are pregnant (Table 3).c Second, use despite knowledge of pregnancy might
c

It is possible that exposure before this time might not directly impact fetal brain development, though it remains
possible for indirect effects to arise indirectly through endocannabinoid receptor expression in the placenta.44

270

represent a more severe form of cannabis use, indicative of higher and more frequent prenatal

271

and potential post-natal exposure (e.g., during breastfeeding) consistent with a dose-response

272

relationship that may reflect variability in liability and/or potential causal influence.45 Third,

273

sustained use during pregnancy may reflect a genetic predisposition to the observed negative

274

outcomes, and the resulting associations may simply reflect pleiotropy.46,47 However, controlling

275

for maternal behavior and genetic susceptibility did not eliminate associations (Supplemental

276

eTables 2-3, 15). Fourth, associations may be attributable to an unmeasured common variable

277

(e.g., paternal germline exposure to cannabis)48 or an alternate derivation of an included

278

confounder.d

279

Self-administration of cannabis, especially when heavy and early, has been strongly

280

associated with increased psychopathology, particularly psychosis.49 In contrast to acute THC

281

psychotomimetic effects,50 mounting evidence supports common genetic liability as a major

282

contributor to this relationship,39,47,51-53 though evidence also supports potential causal effects of

283

psychosis liability on cannabis use,39,47 and vice versa.54,55 Consistent with prior work,21 we find

284

that child psychosis liability (i.e., PLEs and thought problems) is increased among children

285

prenatally exposed to cannabis. Critically building upon this literature, this relationship was only

286

robust to potential confounds when exposure occurred following maternal knowledge of

287

pregnancy. That the relationship with PLEs remained after accounting for family history of

288

psychosis as well as child polygenic risk for schizophrenia, educational attainment, and cannabis

289

use, raises the intriguing possibility that associations between prenatal exposure and psychosis

290

risk may not be entirely attributable to common SNP genomic liability, at least as indexed by

d

Notably, accounting for scores from a 4-item assessment of psychotic-like experiences in mothers (Supplement)
as opposed to familial history of psychosis, which has a low endorsement rate, does not alter the significance of the
association between prenatal marijuana exposure and PLEs in offspring (Supplemental eTable 18)

291

polygenic scores derived from the largest current GWASs that approximate the child outcomes

292

under study (but see also Limitations below). Indeed, putative mechanisms underlying the

293

elevated likelihood of psychosis in children prenatally exposed to cannabis may be distinct from

294

those associated with self-administered cannabis use. For instance, while the endocannabinoid

295

system primarily functions as an on-demand retrograde neuromodulatory system through CB1R

296

signaling throughout life, CB1Rs during the prenatal period are ubiquitously expressed in neural

297

progenitors and contribute to neural migration, axonal elongation, and synaptic formation.9

298

Although such proposed mechanisms would be consistent with neurodevelopmental theories of

299

psychosis,56 the associations we observed with gross brain morphology metrics were not robust

300

to covariate inclusion. It remains possible that neurodevelopmental differences (e.g., synaptic

301

formation) may not be detectable using MRI, may be regionally specific, or may not emerge

302

until later developmental stages.

303

In addition to replicating the well validated association with reduced birth weight,13

304

children prenatally exposed to cannabis following maternal knowledge of pregnancy had

305

elevated internalizing, externalizing, attention, and social problems, as well as reduced cognition.

306

As has been shown for the increased likelihood of tobacco smoking during pregnancy in women

307

with ADHD and the confounding of consequent associations with offspring ADHD,57-59 women

308

with externalizing features (which include cognitive differences) might be more likely to

309

continue using cannabis during their pregnancy. Genetically informed designs (e.g., sibling

310

crossover design where non-twin siblings are discordant for prenatal exposure)60,61 provide one

311

mechanism for identifying such familial sources of confounding.62,63 Notably, prenatal exposure

312

to alcohol and tobacco were also related to offspring psychopathology and cognition, but these

313

associations were predominantly with exposure prior to, as opposed to following, maternal

314

knowledge of pregnancy and observed inconsistently relative to associations with cannabis

315

exposure (Supplemental eTables 2-3). The lack of association with alcohol or tobacco use

316

subsequent to knowledge of pregnancy may indicate the more pronounced public awareness of

317

fetal risks and obstetric oversight of the use of these substances that leads to greater reductions in

318

use post-knowledge of pregnancy, relative to cannabis.8,64 Alternatively, prenatal cannabis

319

exposure may serve as a proxy for exposure to a permissive home environment that promotes

320

externalizing behaviors and related cognitive disengagement.65 In addition, factors broadly

321

correlated with prenatal substance use, such as restricted access to health care, birth-related

322

complications and postpartum maternal behaviors, may plausibly contribute to these

323

associations.66

324

Some limitations are noteworthy. First, parent/caregivers may have underreported

325

marijuana use during pregnancy; however, our estimates are consistent with other national

326

datasets, including toxicology based prevalence estimates.67 Second, although the ABCD study

327

represents the largest integrative study of child health and substance use and is among the largest

328

studies of prenatal exposure and child outcomes, there were a relatively small number of

329

participants who were exposed to cannabis prenatally which reduces power. Third, marijuana

330

concentration differs significantly between fetuses whose mothers use cannabis once per month

331

compared to once per day.15 There are limited or no data on potency, frequency, timing and

332

quantity of cannabis exposure during pregnancy in this dataset; further, the limited number of

333

prenatally exposed individuals limits the utility of more refined analyses of cannabis use

334

variability in this dataset.68 Fourth, while we were able to account for many known familial,

335

pregnancy, and child related confounding variables, the role of unmeasured confounders cannot

336

be discounted. Relatedly, while we account for underling genetic vulnerability using both

337

familial history as well as polygenic scores, it is possible that the current GWASs from which

338

PGS weighting was determined are underpowered and/or not generalizable across development

339

and as such do not adequately represent genomic risk for the specific child outcomes under

340

study, consistent with the lack of association between schizophrenia PGS and PLEs and thought

341

problems (Supplemental eTable 16-17).

342
343

Conclusions

344

Despite increasingly permissive social attitudes and the marked relaxation of legal restrictions on

345

cannabis use,1 prenatal cannabis exposure, and the correlated risks that it indexes, may place

346

offspring at increased risk for psychopathology and reduced cognition in middle childhood. In

347

the context of increasing marijuana use among pregnant women,2,6 it is clear that more studies on

348

the relationship between prenatal cannabis exposure and offspring developmental outcomes are

349

needed to examine potential causal effects, moderating or protective factors, and biological

350

mechanisms at play.69,70 Similar to the highly effective messaging surrounding the adverse

351

consequences of alcohol and tobacco exposure during pregnancy, education regarding the

352

potential harms associated with prenatal marijuana use is necessary. Currently, cannabis use

353

during pregnancy should be discouraged by care providers and dispensaries.11,14

Note. Linear mixed effect models were used to analyze the associations between pre- and post-knowledge of pregnancy use of cannabis
(analyzed separately) and each outcome, nesting data by research site and family ID (non-imaging analyses) and scanner and family ID
(imaging analyses). Psychotic-like experiences were assessed with the Prodromal Questionnaire Brief-Report Child Version; CBCL = Child
Behavior Checklist; uncorrected Cognition Composite from the NIH Toolbox; Sleep problems from the Parent Sleep Disturbance Scale for
Children. N’s differ due to listwise deletion of missing data. All Bs are unstandardized. Values in [] represent 95% Confidence Intervals.
pFDR = p-values after false discovery rate correction for multiple testing, calculated separately for pre- and post-knowledge cannabis
exposure. Bolded values indicate significant associations.

Note. Fixed-effect covariates included: (1-4) prenatal exposure to alcohol or tobacco before or
after knowledge of pregnancy; (5) household income; (6) maternal education level; (7) maternal
age at birth; (8) whether the pregnancy was planned (0 = planned, 1 = unplanned); (9) length of
time (weeks) pregnant before maternal knowledge of pregnancy; (10) prenatal vitamin use; (1117) child race/ethnicity: Caucasian, African American, Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander,
Hispanic, other; (18) birth weight (not included in model with birth weight as the outcome); (19)
child sex (0 = male, 1 = female); (20) child age; (21-22) child substance use: alcohol sip, tobacco
use; (23-27) first-degree familial history of mental illness: depression, psychosis, anxiety, mania,
antisocial behavior; (28) whether the child has a twin or triplet in the study (0 = singleton or
sibling, 1 = twin or triplet). Owing to the limited endorsement of ever having a marijuana puff
among children (n = 14), we did not include this variable as a covariate. However, excluding
these individuals does not meaningfully alter associations, nor does excluding children who used
other substances, were prenatally exposed to other illicit substances, or children born at extreme
prematurity (Supplemental eTables 10-12). Total intracranial volume was included as an
additional covariate in the white and gray matter models; however, excluding this as a covariate
did not alter associations between exposure and gray and white matter volumes (all |Bs|<0.060,
all ps >0.56). N’s differ due to listwise deletion. All Bs are unstandardized. Values in [] represent
95% Confidence Intervals. Bolded values indicate significant associations. Full regression results
are provided in Supplemental eTables 2-4. Log transforming outcomes, including only
covariates significantly associated with the outcomes, or excluding any parent/caregiver report
other than the mother, in the full regression models did not meaningfully alter any observed
associations (Supplemental eTables 5-8). CBCL Externalizing and Cognition Composite
subfacets are reported in Supplemental eTable 9.
