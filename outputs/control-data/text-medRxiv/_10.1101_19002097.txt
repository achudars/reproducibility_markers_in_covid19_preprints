Abstract
Background Reliable surveillance systems are essential to assess the national response to
eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV), in the context of the global strategy towards eliminating
viral hepatitis.

Aim We aimed to assess the completeness of the two national registries of acute HCV
infection in people with HIV, and estimated the number of acute HCV infections among
adults with HIV in the Netherlands.

Methods For 2003-2016, cases of HCV infection and reinfection among adults with a
positive or unknown HIV-serostatus were identified in two national registries: the ATHENA
cohort, and the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases. For 2013-2016, cases were linked,
and two-way capture-recapture analysis was carried out.

Results During 2013-2016, there were an estimated 282 (95%CI: 264-301) acute HCV
infections among adults with HIV. The addition of cases with an unknown HIV-serostatus
increased the matches (from N=104 to N=129), and a subsequently increased the estimated
total: 330 (95%CI: 309-351). Underreporting was estimated at 14-20%.
Conclusion In 2013-2016, up to 330 cases of acute HCV infection were estimated to have
occurred among adults with HIV. National surveillance of acute HCV can be improved by
increased notification of infections. Surveillance data should ideally include both acute and
chronic HCV infections, and be able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections, and
initial and reinfections.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are generally uncommon in the Netherlands, with a chronic
HCV prevalence of <0.2%[1]. However, an increase in the number of acute HCV infections
and reinfections among men who have sex with men (MSM) who are HIV-positive has been
reported since early 2000[2–4]. Detection, diagnosis and registration of acute HCV infections
are crucial to measure trends in the epidemic, and plan appropriate public health and clinical
interventions, such as prevention programs for those at risk, targeted testing, increasing
treatment uptake, and contact tracing to reduce subsequent transmission. In addition,
treating chronic HCV infections with direct acting antivirals (DAAs) is expected to strongly
reduce, but not eliminate, the HCV epidemic among HIV-positive MSM[5,6]. Despite high
DAA uptake in HIV/HCV co-infected people in the Netherlands[7], ongoing HCV transmission
and reinfection continue to occur.

In the Netherlands, the Dutch HIV Monitoring Foundation (Stichting HIV Monitoring, SHM)[8]
registers acute HCV infection among people with HIV since 2000, and the National Registry
for Notifiable Diseases at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment
(Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, RIVM)[4] registers acute HCV infections
among people irrespective of HIV-serostatus since 2003. While the RIVM and SHM have
reported similar trends of acute HCV infection over the years, consistently more cases were
registered among HIV-positive MSM by the SHM, compared to the RIVM[4,9].

Reliable surveillance systems, monitoring and evaluation are essential to assess the national
HCV response, in the context of the global strategy towards eliminating viral hepatitis[10,11].
The question arises whether SHM and the RIVM register the same cases of acute HCV
infection among people with HIV in the Netherlands, and whether cases are missed by one
registry or another. The aim of this study is to assess the completeness of these two national
registries. In addition, we estimate the number of acute HCV infections among the HIVpositive population in the Netherlands, by means of capture-recapture analysis.

Methods
Data sources
Data were obtained from two national registries: the ATHENA national observational HIV
cohort at SHM and the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases at the RIVM. We identified
cases of acute HCV infection among adults (aged ≥18 years at HCV diagnosis) in the period

of 2003-2016 in both registries. Both cases of a primary episode of acute HCV infection and
reinfection were included; reinfections were treated as independent cases.
ATHENA cohort at SHM
Since 2000, SHM has managed the ATHENA cohort and is responsible for registering all
HIV-positive people in care at the 26 HIV-treatment centres in the Netherlands[8]. At entry in
HIV care, people are informed of the cohort and the purpose of data collection by their
treating physician; participant consent follows an opt-out procedure (2% opt-out)[8]. After
linkage to HIV care and registration at SHM, people are enrolled in the ATHENA cohort,
which systematically collects demographic and clinical data from medical records, including
information on HCV co-infection.

All cases of HCV infection were identified in the ATHENA cohort for the period of 2003 to
2016, based on the data lock in May 2017, followed by an update in January 2018. Diagnosis
of HCV infection was based on available laboratory results of HCV-RNA and anti-HCV
IgG[2]. Acute HCV infection definition corresponds to the case definitions by ECDC[12] and
the NEAT preferred criteria [Grade A, Level II][13,14], and was defined as a positive antiHCV IgG with a documented negative anti-HCV IgG within the previous 12 months, or a
detectable HCV-RNA in the presence of either a documented negative HCV-RNA test or a
documented anti-HCV IgG seroconversion within the previous 12 months. Additionally, cases
of acute HCV reinfection were identified following sustained virological response (SVR),
spontaneous clearance, or genotype-switch.

Additionally, cases of chronic HCV infection were defined as HCV-RNA positivity for >6
months. In case of an undetermined stage of HCV infection (i.e., acute or chronic), stage of
infection was verified with the HIV-treating physician. Alternatively, if the stage of HCV
infection remained unresolved, other HCV cases were included as a separate category. We
defined the timing of HCV infection based on the date of the first lab diagnosis (RNA or
antibody).
National Registry for Notifiable Diseases at RIVM
Since 1998, as a legal obligation enforced by the Dutch public health act (Wet publieke
gezondheid)[15], treating physicians ànd diagnostic laboratories must report cases of HCV
infection, together with demographic and epidemiological information, to the local Public
Health Service (Gemeentelijke of Gemeenschappelijke Gezondheidsdienst, GGD). The GGD
subsequently reports to the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases at the RIVM, using the
web-based application OSIRIS[16]. As of 1 October 2003, only acute HCV infections need to

be reported to the RIVM. The RIVM collects additional information on the HIV-serostatus of
people with an acute HCV infection, and whether the HCV infection is a primary or
reinfection, since 1 January 2013.

Cases of acute HCV infection were identified in the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases
at the RIVM for the period of 2003 to 2016, based on the database as of 27 February 2017.
The RIVM case definition corresponds to the SHM case definition (i.e. ECDC[12] and the
NEAT preferred criteria [Grade A, Level II]) and, in addition, includes diagnoses based on a
positive HCV-RNA associated with an elevated alanine aminotransferase according to the
NEAT alternative criteria [Grade B, Level III][13,14]. At RIVM, cases by default were acute
HCV infections, with either confirmed HIV-positive or unknown HIV-serostatus (captured
since 2013). We determined the timing of HCV infection based on the reported date of lab
diagnosis; if unavailable, the first date of illness, or the date of reporting to the RIVM was
used.

Case-linkage and statistical analysis
First, we described the annual number of reported cases by HCV/HIV transmission risk group
and HIV serostatus for the period 2003-2016, using descriptive statistics.

Second, to facilitate capture-recapture analysis, cases of acute HCV infection were linked
between the two databases for the period of 2013-2016. Cases were linked using a stepwise
approach, based on: year and country of birth, sex, postal code (2 or 4 digits), municipal
health service region, and date of HCV diagnosis (allowing a diagnostic timeframe). People
who were living outside the Netherlands but who had been diagnosed and/or were in care in
the Netherlands could not be matched on postal code and were matched based on municipal
health service region. First, we linked the cases of acute HCV infection among cases with an
HIV-positive serostatus. Second, we repeated the linkage and included additional cases of
acute HCV infection reported to the RIVM with both a confirmed positive or unknown HIV
serostatus.

Additionally, we assessed the influence of the distinction between acute and chronic HCV
diagnosis on the registration in both databases. We linked RIVM cases of acute HCV
infection among HIV-positive adults to all SHM cases (i.e., acute, chronic, and other).
Subsequently, we repeated this analysis containing all RIVM cases of acute HCV infection,
including cases with an unknown HIV serostatus.

The capture-recapture method
The capture-recapture method is derived from ecology and applied to epidemiological
studies[17]. To estimate the number of cases in a population, cases are captured in one data
source and then independently recaptured in a second data source. The capture-recapture
method analyses the degree of overlap between the two data sources (Figure 1). The
capture-recapture estimate is adequate when the following assumptions hold[18,19]: i) the
study applies to a closed population, i.e., the definition or interpretation of the ‘target
population’ is explicit; ii) linkage between the cases is possible and reliable; iii) the databases
are functionally independent and do not rely on each other; vi) every case has the same
probability to be included in each database.

For this study, we performed a two-way capture-recapture analysis to estimate the total
number of cases of acute HCV among HIV-positive people based on the two databases for
the period of 2013 to 2016. We calculated the adjusted Petersen–Lincoln estimate[18,19] of
the total number of cases in 2013-2016, and by calendar year (i.e., 2013, 2014, 2015 and
2016) separately:
Adjusted Petersen–Lincoln estimated number of cases:
𝑁𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 =

(𝑁1 + 1)(𝑁2 + 1)

(𝑁12 + 1)

With the associated variance of the estimate of the total population:
𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 =

(𝑁1 + 1)(𝑁2 + 1)(𝑁1 − 𝑁12)(𝑁2 − 𝑁12)
−1
(𝑁12 − 1)2 (𝑁12 + 2)

And the 95% confidence interval of the estimate of the total population:

Results
Acute HCV infections among adults in 2003-2016.
Cases of HCV infection were extracted from both registries as described in Figure 2, and
summarized in Figure 3 and Appendix table 1.
ATHENA cohort at SHM
In total, 2,638 (11.4%) out of all 23,141 adults ever in HIV care and enrolled in ATHENA had
a positive HCV-RNA test at least once (Figure 2). In the period of 2003-2016, 501 people
were diagnosed with an acute primary HCV infection. In addition, 104 acute HCV reinfections
were found among 86 people. The maximum number of acute HCV reinfections found per
person was four. Altogether, we included 566 cases of acute HCV infection among 501 HIVpositive adults with HIV registered by SHM (Appendix Table 1).

We restricted our capture-recapture analysis to the 213 cases of acute HCV infection among
205 HIV-positive adults in the period 2013-2016 (Figure 2, Table 1). All but two cases were
among males (N=211; 99.1%), the median age at HCV diagnosis was 43 years [IQR 36-50],
and 171 (80.3%) were born in the Netherlands. Sexual contact among MSM was the main
route of HIV infection (N=199; 93.4%). The remaining 12 cases were among people who had
acquired HIV through heterosexual contact (N=6; 2.8%), injecting drug use (N=2; 0.9%),
blood or blood products (N=2; 0.9%), or another or unknown route (N=4; 1.9%). Acute HCV
was diagnosed a median 5.9 years [IQR 2.6-10.7] after HIV diagnosis.

Chronic HCV infections and other HCV cases
Additionally, 918 chronic HCV infections and 432 other HCV cases were registered in the
period 2003-2016. Out of 432 other HCV cases, 357 people had a positive HCV antibody or
RNA test followed by a negative HCV-RNA result, without having received HCV treatment.
These people had likely spontaneously cleared the infection without treatment. Moreover, 75
out of 432 people were diagnosed with HCV based on a single HCV-RNA test result without
further diagnostic information. In the period 2013-2016, 283 chronic HCV infections and 136
other HCV cases were registered. The median time between HIV and subsequent HCV
diagnosis was 5.7 years [IQR 1.5-10.] and 5.6 years [IQR 0.5-11.9] for chronic HCV
infections and other HCV cases, respectively.
National Registry for Notifiable Diseases at RIVM
In the period of 2003 to 2016, 655 cases of acute HCV infection were registered at the RIVM
(Figure 2). Seven cases were excluded because they were among children or adolescents
(<18 years of age); 5 out of 7 had acquired HCV through vertical transmission, leaving 648
cases of acute HCV infection among adults (Appendix Table 1). The median age at
diagnosis was 43 years [IQR 35-49], and 89.0% were male (N=577). Two-thirds of the cases
were reported among people who were born in the Netherlands (N=438; 67.6%). The main
route of HCV transmission was sexual contact (N=434; 67.0%), followed by injecting drug
use (N=50; 7.7%), or a needle stick or bite incident (N=16; 2.5%); the remaining 148
infections were acquired through another or unknown transmission route (22.8%). Overall,
406 out of 648 (62.7%) of all acute HCV infections were acquired through sex between men
(i.e., MSM).
We restricted our capture-recapture analysis to the 231 cases of acute HCV infection in
2013-2016 (Figure 2, Table 1). Overall, 191 (82.7%) out of 231 HCV infections were known
primary infections and 9 (3.9%) were reported as reinfections; data on primary/reinfection
were unknown for the remaining 31 (13.4%) cases. In total, 142 out of 231 (61.5%) cases
were reported among HIV-positive men, 58 (25.1%) had an unknown or missing HIV
serostatus (28 of whom were MSM), and 31 (13.4%) were HIV-negative (11 of whom were
MSM). Of note, 6 out of 9 reported HCV reinfections occurred in HIV-positive people; for the
remaining 3 reinfections, the HIV-serostatus was unknown. No reinfections were reported
among HIV-negative people.

All HIV-positive people were male, the median age at HCV diagnosis was 43 years [IQR 3551], and 118 (83.1%) were born in the Netherlands. Sexual contact among MSM was the
main route of HCV infection (N=130; 91.6%). The remaining 12 HCV infections were

acquired through other sexual contact (N=2, heterosexual and unknown), injecting drug use
(N=2), a needle stick or bite incident (N=1), or another or unknown route (N=7).

Capture-recapture analysis for 2013-2016
First, we linked the 213 and 142 cases of acute HCV infection among HIV-positive adults as
registered in 2013-2016 by SHM and RIVM, respectively (Table 1A). In total, 107 cases were
found in both registries: 50.2% of the 213 SHM cases could be linked to RIVM cases, and
75.4% of the 142 RIVM cases to SHM cases. The median time between diagnosis as
documented by SHM and RIVM was 56 days [IQR 14-309]; 74 (69.2%) cases were
documented by SHM first, 29 (27.1%) were documented by RIVM first, and 4 (3.7%) were
diagnosed on the same date. Based on capture-recapture analysis, a total of 282 (95%CI:
264-301) acute HCV infections among HIV-positive adults were estimated for the period of
2013-2016. The estimated annual number of cases was 72 (95%CI: 65-80) in 2013, 74
(95%CI: 63-86) in 2014, 87 (95%CI: 78-96) in 2015 and 47 (95%CI: 40-54) in 2016 (Figure
4A). Based on these estimates, underreporting of acute HCV among HIV-positive people
was 13.9% for SHM and 19.5% for RIVM.

Second, the addition of 58 RIVM-cases with an unknown HIV-serostatus led to an increase in
the number of matches (Table 1B). In total, 129 cases were found in both registries: 60.6%
of the 213 SHM-cases, and 64.5% of the 200 RIVM cases. The median time between
diagnosis as documented by SHM and RIVM was 56 days [IQR 14-341]; 90 (69.8%) cases
were documented by SHM first, 36 (27.9%) were documented by RIVM first, and 3 (2.3%)
were diagnosed on the same date. The addition of cases with an unknown HIV serostatus
led to an increase of the overall estimated total number of acute HCV infections among HIVpositive adults: from 282 (95%CI: 264-301) to 330 (95%CI: 309-351) estimated cases in the
period of 2013-2016 (Figure 4B). With the addition of RIVM cases with an unknown HIV
serostatus, underreporting of acute HCV among HIV-positive people was 17.7% for SHM
and 18.7% for RIVM.

Chronic HCV infections and other HCV cases
Additionally, we linked all 632 cases of HCV infection among HIV positive adults registered
by SHM (i.e., acute, chronic, and other), with the 142 cases of acute HCV infection adults
who were HIV positive, registered by the RIVM (Appendix Table 2). All but two RIVM-cases
could be linked to an acute, chronic, or other HCV case registered by SHM (98.6%; 140 out
of 142). Furthermore, when we added the 58 RIVM-cases of acute HCV infection among
people with an unknown HIV serostatus -- i.e. when we linked the 632 SHM cases with the

200 RIVM cases -- we could link 175 cases of HCV infection, indicating underreporting of
HIV-positivity at RIVM and missed acute cases in the SHM data.

Discussion
Based on data from the two national registries (SHM and RIVM), we estimated 282-330
cases of acute HCV infection among HIV-positive adults in the Netherlands, for the period of
2013-2016. Underreporting was estimated at 14-18% for SHM and 19-20% for RIVM.
Underreporting could partially be explained by an unknown HIV-serostatus at RIVM, or by
differences between RIVM and SHM in HCV stage at first diagnosis (acute or chronic). From
2003-2016, the predominant route of HCV transmission was sexual transmission among
(HIV-positive) MSM.

The results should be interpreted while taking into account the study's limitations. Notably,
capture-recapture analysis is based on several assumptions, which influence the accuracy
and reliability of the presented estimates[18,19]. Our study fulfils all four assumptions.
However, incorrect case linkage and non-linkage cannot be ruled out because linkage was
based on personal characteristics, and not on personal identifiers.

Our annual estimates of the number of acute HCV infections among people with HIV are in
line with HCV incidence studies performed among HIV-positive MSM both in Amsterdam[24]
and across Europe[25]. The estimated number of acute HCV infections was lower in 2016
than in to 2013, 2014 and 2015, which could be explained by a delay in registration, a
change in the frequency of HCV testing[26], or an actual decrease in HCV incidence among
HIV-positive people in the Netherlands, most likely due to increased DAA uptake. The latter
is in line with recently published findings covering 17 out of 26 Dutch HIV-treatment centres,
relating the high DAA uptake to a lower HCV incidence among HIV-positive MSM in 2016,
than in to 2014[5]. Of note, annual numbers are known to fluctuate over time, also before
2013, and recent numbers reported by the RIVM showed a subsequent increase in the total
number of HCV infections for 2017 compared to 2016[4].

Underreporting at both registries could be explained by several factors. At SHM,
underreporting of acute HCV infections could be due to missed or incomplete screening for
HCV by the HIV treating physician. Virtually all RIVM cases of acute HCV infection could be
identified at SHM, although some RIVM cases of acute HCV were registered as chronic HCV
at SHM. Previous analyses of the SHM have data shown substantial variation in routine HCV
screening for all HIV-positive people at entry into HIV care, as well as in annual HCV
screening among risk groups (i.e., MSM)[2]. This may, to some extent, be explained by

centres applying a policy of targeted screening guided by the presence of incident
transaminase elevations[27]. Furthermore,

complimentary qualitative investigation has

identified additional guideline, patient, physician, and environmental factors influencing the
compliance to guidelines for laboratory monitoring in outpatient HIV care in the
Netherlands[28]. At the RIVM, cases are reported through the local GGD, which receives
case notifications from the diagnostic laboratories and physicians in or outside of HIV care. A
marked reduction in HCV screening at some Dutch STI clinics among HIV-positive MSM
could explain missed diagnoses and, as such, underreporting of acute HCV infections,
specifically among HIV-positive people not engaged in HIV care or not screened for HCV in
HIV care. This is largely an effect of a change in screening policy by the Amsterdam STI
clinic, the largest in the Netherlands, which had to discontinue HCV screening due to
financial constraints in 2014; although HCV screening in HIV-positive MSM was restarted in
2017. However, the acute HCV infections among HIV positive people should have been
diagnosed in HIV care and reported to the RIVM. Additionally, a large proportion of RIVM
cases had a missing or unknown HIV-serostatus. Unknown HIV serostatus could be due to a
notification by the laboratory (that is unaware of HIV-serostatus), or due to lack of HIV testing
among HCV-positive people. The relatively high HCV prevalence observed among (HIVnegative) MSM starting PrEP[29] underscores the need for routine combined STI/HCV
screening among MSM at high risk for HIV infection.

Our study confirmed that linkage of two national databases is possible, and can provide
reliable surveillance data with additional value. Previously, van Leth et al., linked the national
tuberculosis registry to SHM to assess the TB-HIV prevalence in the Netherlands[30]. Data
linkage studies are versatile and can strengthen multi-disease surveillance. Infectious
disease surveillance data are essential for the planning and evaluation of public health
activities. The sensitivity of surveillance systems relies on the likelihood of the infections
being identified, diagnosed, and reported. We therefore recommend that all HCV infections,
both acute and chronic, are registered at the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases at the
RIVM, as in practice the timing of diagnosis and reporting by different health care workers
can differ. Limiting the notification and registration to acute HCV infections only was primarily
motivated by the need to trace sources and contacts. However, recent national action plan to
eliminate hepatitis requires comprehensive detection and registration of all HCV
infections[10,11].

To control and eventually eliminate HCV from the HIV-positive population in the Netherlands
and beyond, all HIV/HCV co-infected people should be diagnosed, linked to, and retained in
care[10,11]. Registration is essential to monitor trends in the epidemic, and to assess the

impact of treatment and other interventions on HCV incidence. The high rate of HCV
reinfections among HIV-positive MSM[2,31] warrants the need for increased awareness and
prevention measures for high risk MSM, as well as structural repeat screening of HCV
infection[32,33]. We call for increased attention for both documentation of HCV cases in
medical records and disease notification at RIVM, by all health professionals. Surveillance
data should ideally include both acute and chronic HCV infections, and be able to distinguish
between acute and chronic infections, and initial and reinfections. Robust HCV surveillance
is essential to monitor the impact of prevention programs and DAA treatment uptake – on
both the individual and public health level.
