(M-LAINUT) in guiding radial artery cannulation in adults.

Methods

：

We conducted a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial of 288

patients undergoing radial artery cannulation. Patients were randomized 1:1 to M-LAINUT or

C-PT group at fujian medical university union hospital between 2017 and 2018. Radial artery

cannulation was performed by three anesthesiologists with different experience. The

outcome was the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, the number of

attempts and the cannulation time.

Results: 285 patients were statistically analyzed. The success rate of first attempt was 91.6%
in the M-LAINUT group (n=143) and 57.7% in the C-PT group (n=142; P<0.001) (odds

ratio, 7.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-15.7). The total success rate (≤5 min and ≤3 attempts)

in the M-LAINUT group was 97.9%, compared to 84.5% in the palpation group (p <0.001)

(odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-29.2). The total cannulation time was shorter

and the number of attempts was fewer in the M-LAINUT group than that in the C-PT group

(p <0. 05).

Conclusion:

Modified long-axis in-plane ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation can

increase the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, reduce the number of

attempts and shorten the total cannulation time in adults.

1. Introduction
In the emergency room, intensive care unit (ICU) and operating room, especially in

major operation and critical patients, arterial blood pressure monitoring is often carried out

by arterial cannulation to monitor hemodynamic changes closely.

Radial artery cannulation was traditionally performed by palpation of radial artery

pulsation.

Ultrasound-guided

techniques

have

been

widely

used

in

various

arterial

cannulations because of its visual characteristics and higher success rate of cannulation

compared with traditional palpation.

1-3

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that the first success rate

of ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation is greater than traditional palpation and the

success rate of cannulation is 68% to 100%, which mainly depends on the technique used,

the skill level of the operator, the condition of the blood vessel, and the definition of

successful puncture.

4-6

Short-axis out-of-plane ultrasound guidance may have shortcomings,

such as blurred local imaging, unclear pinpoint positioning and a high vascular penetration

7

rate, which make the first attempt cannulation success rate not very high.

2

In the long-axis

in-plane ultrasound guidance technique,two studies reported ultrasound success rates of

53% and 62%, respectively.

4,8

Therefore, we designed a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical research

method

to

evaluate

the

effect

of

the

modified

long-axis

in-plane

ultrasound

technique(M-LAINUT) in guiding radial artery cannulation. We hypothesized the M-LAINUT

would have a higher rate of cannulation on the attempt compared with the conventional

palpation technique(C-PT).

The

at

clinicaltrials.gov

(http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx,number:ChiCTR-IOR-17011474;Principal investigator:
Jiebo Wang, Date of registration: 23 May 2017).
Adult patients with the diameter of the radial artery was not less than 2.2 mm

scheduled for elective surgery were included in this trial. Exclusion criteria were ulnar artery

occlusion, history of forearm surgery, skin infection at the puncture site, abnormal modified

Allen test, and coagulation dysfunction Randomization and Blinding

Patients were randomized 1:1 to M-LAINUT or the C-PT for the success rate of the

attempt at radial artery cannulation. Before the study began, all the random numbers were

generated by a computer and placed in sealed envelopes. Study assignment was concealed

until after the decision had been made to radial artery cannulation and the patient was

enrolled in the trial.

Three anesthesiologists who performed radial artery cannulation were divided into

three categories according to the years of clinical training in anesthesia after graduation

from medical college: one year (CA1), three years (CA3), and five years (CA5). At least 15

cases of radial artery catheterization guided by the M-LAINUT were performed for each

operator before starting the study.

Before the patient was sent to the operating room, the diameter and depth of the

radial artery were measured by a specialist anesthesiologist who did not perform artery

cannulation using an ultrasound instrument (SonoSite M-Turbo Color Doppler Ultrasound

Diagnostic instrument, Linear

cannulations was performed before or after induction of general anesthesia according to

anesthesiologist's preference. The specified technique was then used to place the radial

artery catheter using a 20-gauge intravenous catheter (Insyte; Becton Dickinson, LTD. USA).

Towels and ultrasonic probe covers were provided if modified ultrasound was selected.

In the M-LAINUT group, the wrist joint angle of the patient was adjusted to 45°. The

operator faced the end of the patient’s arm, and the probe was held in the left hand with

the bracket as the supporting point, then the needle was held with right thumb and index

finger just like pen-holding. After examining the artery in cross section, the US probe was

rotated 90° to obtain the view of long axis artery (Figure 1A). The ultrasonic plane should be

aligned with the long axis of the artery. The imaging mode of the ultrasound was switched to

color doppler mode (CFM) to obtain the arterial blood flow signal. As the probe was slided

slowly parallel to the long axis of artery, more abundant signal of the arterial blood flow

could be obtained. (Figure 1B). The needle tip was placed on the contact point of the centre

line of probe and the skin, and then inserted to the skin at an angle of 15°–40°. The needle

should be always aligned with the centre line of the probe during the procedures of

cannulation (Figure 1A). Once the needle tip compressed the anterior wall of the radial

artery, the collapsed radial artery and the decrease of blood flow signal could be shown on

the ultrasound image (Figure 1B). After confirming the tip of needle within the lumen of

artery on the ultrasound image and the appearance of the arterial blood in the hub of

needle, keeping continuous clear visualization of needle tip and the artery, the needle was

advanced approximately 3-5mm. If the blood continued to flow into the hub, the needle was

withdrawn 1 -2cm out of cannula, then the needle and cannula were pushed into the blood

vessel, at last, the needle was pulled out (Figure 1C) and the cannula was connected to the

arterial invasive monitoring system.

In palpation, the operator palpated the radial artery pulse with the left index and

middle fingers. The strongest pulse point was identified as the puncture point. The needle

and cannula were advanced toward the radial artery at an angle of approximately 15°–30°.

Once blood appeared in the hub, the angle of needle decreased slightly, and the needle was

advanced approximately 3mm. If blood continued to flow into the hub, the cannula was

pushed into the artery.

The data were collected by other anesthesiologists who were not associated with the

performance of the procedure, including age, height, body mass index, sex, and history of

peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Twenty-four hours and three days after surgery were the

follow-up times, during which data were recorded by anesthesiologists who were not aware

of the grouping. The primary investigators concurrently assessed the same endpoints for a

sample of 10% of study cannulations to confirm the accuracy of the data. Measurement of

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the success of the first cannulation which was defined as the

successful insertion of the cannula with one skin puncture for the first time and the

acquisition of arterial waveforms.Cannula insertion failure was defined as greater than 3

cannulation attempts for a single arm or an attempted cannulation time more than 5

minutes.

4.

Secondary outcomes included the cannulation time (seconds), the number of attempts,

complications, etc. The cannulation time was defined as the interval between the first skin

penetration and confirmation of the arterial waveform on the monitor. The number of

attempts was defined as the number of skin perforations caused by the puncture needle.

2.1. Statistical Analysis

According to a previous study, the success rate of puncture was 68% in the palpation

group and 92% in the ultrasound group. W ith an expected 10% loss rate per group, we

calculated a sample size of 288 patients by the Z-pooled normal approximation method, and

96 patients would receive radial artery cannulation from each operator. All the data were

processed by SPSS software (Version 24.0, IBM, USA). The measured data are expressed as

the mean±standard deviation. First, normality and variance homogeneity were tested, and

the t test was used for comparisons between groups. If the variance was uneven, the

two-sample rank-sum test was used to compare groups. The count data were tested by the

χ

test. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated by the Woolf method. A two-tailed p

<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3. Results
In this study, three patients were excluded, so 285 patients were randomized into the

final analysis. Figure 2 illustrates participant recruitment and group allocation. Reasons for

exclusion

included

the

(M-LAINUT,

the

attending

anesthesiologist decided not to insert the cannula into the radial artery (C-PT, n=1), and the

loss of medical records (C-PT, n=1). General basic characteristics were similar between the

two groups (Table 1).

Cannulation success rates on the first attempt and total attempts in the M-LAINUT

group were 91.6% and 97.9%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the 57.7%

and 84.5% in the C-PT group (p <0.001, Table 2). The cannula insertion failure rate in the

C-PT group was 15.5%, which was significantly higher than the 2.1% in the M-LAINUT group

(p <0.001, Table 2).

The total cannulation time of the C-PT group was longer than that of the M-LAINUT

group (Z=-4.08, p <0.001, figure 3). The data of total cannulation time were nonnormally

distributed and the variance was uneven, the two-sample rank-sum test was used for

statistical processing. Our results showed a significant reduction in the number of attempts

required to cannulate the radial artery with M-LAINUT versus C-PT (mean: 1.11±0.39 vs

1.72±0.89, p <0.001, figure 4).

The incidence of hematoma in the C-PT group was 19.7%, which was significantly higher

than the 2.8% in the M-LAINUT group (p <0.001, OR, 8.54, 95% CI,2.9 to 25.0, table 4). We

found that hematoma caused by puncture was a high risk factor for cannulation failure in

both groups (p <0.001; OR, 118; 95% confidence interval, 34–405, figure 5).

Subgroup Analyses

In three subgroups (CA1, CA3, CA5), the success rate of the first attempt in the

M-LAINUT group was significantly higher than that in the C-PT group (p<0.001, figure 6).

The overall success rate of M-LAINUT in the CA1 and CA3 groups was higher than that

in C-PT group, but not significantly (p> 0.05, figure 6). In the CA5 group, the overall success

rate of M-LAINUT was significantly higher than that of the C-PT group (p <0.05, figure 6).

The first and total success rates of C-PT in the CA5 group were 72.3% and 87.2%,

respectively, which were lower than those of M-LAINUT in the CA1 group (85.1% and 95.7%).

However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p>0.05,

figure 6).

In the M-LAINUT group, the first-attempt success rate of CA5 was 97.9%, which was

significantly higher than the 85.1% of the CA1 group (p<0.05, figure 6). However, there was

no statistically significant difference in the total cannulation success rate between the two

groups (p>0.05, figure 6).

In each subgroup, the second and third attempt success rate of cannulation in the C-PT

group was significantly higher than that in the M-LAINUT group (p <0.001, Table 3). We also

found that the C-PT success rate on the second and third attempts in the CA5 group was

significantly lower than that of CA1 or CA3 (p

experience, M-LAINUT significantly improved the total success rate. For an experienced

anesthesiologist, the use of M-LAINUT can improve the first-attempt success rate. In addition,

we found that hematoma caused by puncture was a high risk factor for the failure of

cannulation.

Obtaining a long axis view may be challenging since the thickness of the ultrasonic

beam is approximately 1-2 mm. However, after obtaining a short axis view of the artery, the

US probe was rotated 90°, keeping the arterial image in the centre of the ultrasound screen,

which can help to identify and obtain the long axis view of the radial artery.

the blood flow signal and the diameter of artery, the clinician can adjust the ultrasound

For CA1 and CA3, the second and third attempt cannulation success rate of the C-PT

group was higher than that of the M-LAINUT group. To some extent, the second to third

attempt success rate of C-PT compensated for the deficiency in the first cannulation success

rate, which may have caused the small difference in the total cannulation success rate

between the two groups. However, in the C-PT group, the success rate of the second and

third cannulations in the CA5 group was significantly lower than that of CA1 and CA3, which

may be the reason why the total success rate of M-LAINUT in the CA5 group was higher than

found that ultrasound guidance

did not increase the total success rate of radial artery cannulation, which is inconsistent with

our findings, the reason for which may be related to the different ultrasound technology,

patients population, operators experience.

A study

10

using modified short-axis out-of-plane ultrasound to guide

radial artery

cannulation showed that the success rate of the first cannulation was 88.9%, which was

similar to that in our study (91.6%), but the total success rate (100%) was higher than that in

our study (97.9%). The reason could be that, in addition to the different ultrasound guidance

techniques used, the operators were different: an experienced anesthesiologist had used the

ultrasound-guided technique for approximately 200 procedures. Our study involved three

anesthesiologists with different clinical experience who underwent short-term training of

ultrasound-guided artery cannulation.

using

ultrasound-guided dynamic tip localization for radial artery cannulation showed that the

average diameter of the radial artery was 2.8 mm, with a first success rate of 83% and a total

success rate of 89.3%,which was inconsistent with our study. This may be related to the

number of operators and the different training and experience of the operators; 41 residents

and faculty members performed radial artery cannulation, which may have reduced the

success rate.
