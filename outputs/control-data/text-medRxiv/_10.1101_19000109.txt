Abstract

3

The fetal inflammatory response (FIR) increases the risk of perinatal brain injury, particularly in

4

extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, < 28 weeks of gestation). One of the

5

mechanisms contributing to such a risk is a postnatal intermittent or sustained systemic

6

inflammation (ISSI) following FIR. The link between prenatal and postnatal systemic

7

inflammation is supported by the presence of well-established inflammatory biomarkers in the

8

umbilical cord and peripheral blood. However, the extent of molecular changes contributing to

9

this association is unknown. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics, we

10

profiled the transcriptome and proteome of archived neonatal dried blood spot (DBS) specimens

11

from 21 ELGANs. Comparing FIR-affected and unaffected ELGANs, we identified 783 gene and

12

27 protein expression changes of 50% magnitude or more, and an experiment-wide significance

13

level below 5% false discovery rate. These expression changes confirm the robust postnatal

14

activation of the innate immune system in FIR-affected ELGANs and reveal an impairment of

15

their adaptive immunity. In turn, the altered pathways provide clues about the molecular

16

mechanisms triggering ISSI after FIR, and the onset of perinatal brain injury.

Introduction

20

Intraamniotic infection (IAI), one of the main causes of preterm birth, can lead to a maternal

21

(MIR) and a fetal (FIR) inflammatory response, which can be detected in placental tissues1

22

(Supp. Table S1). FIR can cause damage to fetal organs presumably by triggering a systemic

23

inflammation, leading to distant organ injury and increasing the risk of multiple adverse neonatal

24

outcomes, such as perinatal brain damage2,3. Understanding the molecular dynamics of FIR and

25

its downstream alterations before and after birth is thus crucial to developing diagnostic and

26

therapeutic strategies that improve the clinical outcome of extreme preterm birth.

27
28

In a previous work, we found that FIR triggers a broad and complex transcriptional response in

29

umbilical cord (UC) tissue4, which others have shown to correlate with cognitive impairment at

30

10 years of age5. The molecular and cellular alterations induced by FIR can persist after birth6

31

and interact with postnatal inflammation-initiating illnesses such as bacteremia, mechanical

32

ventilation or necrotizing enterocolitis7. This interaction ultimately leads to what is known as an

2

intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI)8,9, which is in turn strongly associated

3

with perinatal brain injury and developmental disorders in ELGANs9 (Extremely Low Gestational

4

Age Newborn, i.e. birth before the 28 week of gestation). The joint presence of placental

5

inflammation and ISSI appears to increase the risk of perinatal brain injury, highlighting the

6

important contribution of postnatal systemic inflammation to that risk10,11. However, little is

7

known about the extent of postnatal molecular changes associated with FIR, which can

8

contribute to understanding the link between FIR and ISSI and consequently provide an array of

9

candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for perinatal brain injury.

10
11

Here, we analyze the transcriptome and proteome of archived neonatal DBSs from ELGANs

12

and identify RNA and protein expression changes in whole blood that are significantly

13

associated with FIR. These molecular changes provide, with an unprecedented level of

14

resolution, a snapshot of the pathways participating in ISSI as a result of the exposure to FIR.

Results

16

Clinical characteristics of ELGANs and molecular profiling of DBS samples

17

The samples analyzed in this study were from 21 ELGANs (8 females and 13 males), who met

18

the eligibility criteria (see Methods). Histological acute chorioamnionitis was diagnosed in 15

19

cases. MIR was in stage I in two cases, stage II in one case, and stage III in 12 cases. Ten of

20

the 12 cases with stage III MIR showed FIR: four in stage I, five stage II, and one stage III

21

(Supp. Fig. S1). Other clinical characteristics and outcomes are presented in Table 1,

22

separately for those with and without FIR. For instance, FIR-affected ELGANs presented a

23

higher frequency of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (89% vs 29%, two-tailed Fisher’s

24

exact test P=0.035) than unaffected ones, and had significantly higher maternal blood C-

25

reactive protein (CRP) levels at admission (t-test P=0.041), as well as significantly higher (t-test

26

P=0.034) and lower (t-test P=0.018) amniotic fluid (AF) IL-6 and glucose levels, respectively.

27

Our data are compatible with no differences in neonatal morbidities between FIR-affected and

28

unaffected ELGANs, although a higher frequency of neonatal sepsis and intraventricular

29

hemorrhage was observed in FIR cases. Mean gestational age (GA) and birth weight were

30

similar between the two groups, averaging 26 weeks and 860 g, respectively. Such an

31

extremely low birth weight, with a lowest value of 580 g and up to 8 neonates under 750 g,

32

precludes a standard blood extraction after birth for the purpose of molecular profiling in

33

research. On the other hand, UC blood is not an alternative either, because is not

newborn screening program constitute a minimally invasive option to profile the transcriptome

Total RNA sequencing of the 21 archived DBSs produced more than 500 million paired-end

reads, which we transformed into a table of 25,221 gene-level summarized count expression

11

profiles. Nearly half of these genes (11,279) showed reliable levels of expression in at least 6 of

12

the 21 samples and were those selected for further analysis (see Methods). Figure 1a shows

13

the distribution of sequencing depth across different genomic elements for each sample, where

14

only about ⅓ of the total sequencing depth derives from exonic reads. DBS samples in this

15

cohort were stored at room temperature for one to seven years until RNA extraction and

16

sequencing. Over this period of time, degradation and fragmentation processes affect RNA

17

integrity and we thus investigated whether, as observed in ancient DNA samples14, there is a

detectable damage to the RNA due to cytosine deamination on such a short timescale (see

3

Methods). Indeed, we found a significant linear relationship (r=0.8, P < 0.001) between the

4

probability of a C>T substitution due to damage and the elapsed time between DBS extraction

5

and RNA sequencing (Fig. 1b). Additionally, mass-spectrometry proteomics on DBSs produced

6

649 quantified protein expression profiles (Supplementary Data File 1), from which we selected

7

245 as being reliably expressed in at least 6 of the 21 samples (see Methods).

8

Sample-level changes of transcriptomics data, projected in two dimensions (Fig. 1c), show that

9

gene-level expression profiles derived from exonic reads capture the differences in placental

10

inflammation throughout the different stages of MIR and FIR. Analogously, DBS protein

11

expression profiles also show a clear separation between infants with and without MIR and FIR

12

(Fig. 1d). In summary, transcriptomics and proteomics of archived DBS samples can produce a

13

large catalog of molecular measurements that capture clinical features of the perinatal period.

Archived neonatal DBSs contain gene and protein expression changes associated with

16

The differential expression analysis of RNA-seq transcriptomic profiles between FIR and non-

17

FIR exposed ELGANs identified 783 differentially expressed (DE) genes under an experiment-

18

wide significance threshold of 5% false discovery rate (FDR) and a minimum 50%-fold change

19

(Fig. 2a, Supp. Table S2). We replicated similar magnitude changes from DE genes on a

20

logarithmic scale (r=0.75, R2=0.56, P < 0.001) in the analogous differential expression analysis

21

of a DBS gene expression dataset15 from the US ELGAN cohort (Fig. 2b, Supp. Table S3 and

22

Supp. Fig. S2 to S5), despite differences in sample preparation and gene expression profiling

23

technology (see Methods). The hierarchical clustering of the 21 transcriptomic samples, using

24

the 783 DE genes, leads to a perfect separation of the neonates who were affected by FIR, from

25

those that were unaffected (Fig. 3).

A further question is whether there are RNA changes in peripheral blood across the different

13

stages of MIR and FIR. Indeed, we found 58 genes with FDR < 5%, for which a combination of

14

MIR and FIR stages, reflecting an increasing exposure to prenatal inflammation, led to a

15

minimum increase of 50% in gene expression levels for each additional combined inflammatory

16

stage (Supplementary Figure S6 and Table S4).

The differential expression analysis of proteomic profiles between FIR-exposed neonates and

3

those who were unexposed identified 27 DE proteins at 5% FDR with a minimum 50%-fold

4

change (Fig. 2c, Supp. Table S5). Figure 2d shows a comparison between log2-fold changes of

5

the transcriptomics and proteomics analyses. Six of the 27 DE proteins are encoded by genes

6

that are also DE by RNA-seq, while for 14 of them, their corresponding genes do not show fold-

7

changes above 50% in the transcriptomics data. The remaining seven DE proteins do not have

8

minimum levels of expression in the RNA-seq assay. Among them, F2, FGA, FGB and A1BG

9

are secreted from the liver into the blood, and this may also be the case for SERPINA3 and

10

APOE, which have a biased expression towards liver. Overall, these results show that in

11

peripheral blood from ELGANs there are sizeable numbers of transcriptomic and proteomic

12

changes associated with FIR that can be detected in archived DBS.

FIR is associated with a persistent postnatal activation of the innate immune system

5

Protein biomarkers have helped in the discovery of a postnatal systemic inflammatory hit

6

following FIR6. However, the extent of such molecular changes was previously unknown. Our

7

transcriptomic data from DBS samples shows the upregulation in FIR of many genes involved in

8

the innate immune response (Fig. 2a; Supp. Table S2). Such genes include those coding for

9

pattern recognition receptors (PRRs, e.g., NLRC4, CLEC4E, FPR1), inflammatory transcription

10

factors (e.g., CEBPD, KLF5), acute phase response proteins (HP, ORM1), as well as multiple

11

inflammatory mediators including cytokines (e.g., IL18, IL1R1, RETN), calgranulins (S100A8,

12

S100A9,S100A12), chemokines (e.g., CXCR1, CXCL1), complement (e.g., C5AR2, C3AR1),

13

lipid mediators (e.g., LTA4H, ALOX5AP, CYP4F3), proteolytic enzymes (e.g., MMP8, MMP9)

14

and adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM3, ITGAM). Our proteomic data from DBS samples (Fig. 2c,

15

Supp. Table S5) also shows protein overexpression in FIR of diverse inflammatory mediators of

16

the innate immune system, such as the S100A8, S100A9, LTF, MPO and DEFA3 proteins.

17
18

A functional enrichment analysis using the Gene Ontology (GO) database (Fig. 3) shows GO

19

terms associated with the innate immune system, such as innate immune response in mucosa

20

(OR=17.7) and defense response to fungus (OR=14.3), which were significantly enriched (FDR

21

< 10%) in upregulated genes (Supp. Table S6; see Methods). Moreover, we also observed a

22

significant enrichment of DE genes in curated gene sets of the innate immune response, such

23

as the InnateDB18 (one-tailed Fisher’s exact P < 2.2 × 10−16, OR=3.2). All these gene and

24

protein expression changes constitute the most comprehensive description to date of the

25

persistent postnatal activation of the innate immune system in ELGANs affected by FIR.

26

FIR is associated with NLRC4 inflammasome activation

27

The activation of the innate immune system involves the assembly of different multiprotein

28

complexes known as inflammasomes, which are categorized according to their constituent

29

PRRs. After detection of microbial and endogenous danger signals by PRRs, inflammasomes

30

induce, via activation of caspase-1 (CASP1), the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18

31

cytokines, bacterial clearance and pyroptosis. The release of interleukin-1 family cytokines such

32

as IL-1β and IL-18 has potent effects on neutrophil activation and recruitment19. The NLRC4

We found that FIR upregulates the expression of the NLRC4 inflammasome and IL-1 family-

related protein-coding genes (e.g., NLRC4, PYCARD, IL18, IL1R1). We also found a significant

7

overlap (Fig. 2a, one-tailed Fisher’s exact P < 2.2x10-16, OR=10.4) of DE genes with a

transcriptional signature of the NLRC4-infantile-onset macrophage activation syndrome

11

10%, OR > 1.5) GO terms related to neutrophil activation20, such as neutrophil migration

12

(OR=6.3) or positive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis (OR=7.5); see Fig. 3 and

13

Supplementary Table S6. These findings suggest that FIR leads to an initial proinflammatory-

14

driven response (IL-6, IL-1b, CXCL8), followed by a posterior neonatal robust activation of the

15

IL-18/IL-1 axis through the NLRC4-inflammasome that can induce a persistent, systemic

16

neutrophil activation.

17

FIR is associated with the impairment of adaptive immunity and thymic function through

18

the expansion of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells

19

The mechanism by which antenatal FIR leads to a postnatal systemic inflammation is unknown.

20

Among several plausible alternatives, Dammann and Leviton (2014)8 suggested an alteration in

21

the number of T cells and their regulation. A closer look at the hierarchical clustering of genes in

22

Figure 3 reveals an enrichment of downregulated transcription-factor coding genes (one-tailed

23

Fisher’s exact test P < 0.001, OR=2.9, Supp. Table S8) in FIR-affected ELGANs. Many of these

24

genes are regulators of T cell development and activation, such as TBX21, GATA3 and RORA,

25

respectively involved in T-helper(h) fate of CD4+ T cells in Th1, Th2 and Th17 lineages (Fig.

26

2a). More generally, we found the downregulation of key genes associated with the IL-7 and IL-

27

2 signaling pathways (e.g., IL7R, BCL2, PIK3AP1, IL2RB, CD3E, CD3G) involved in T cell

28

development (Supp. Tables S2 and S9). The TCR signaling pathway (e.g., CD3E, CD3G, LCK,

29

FYN, ZAP70, CD247) and T cell differentiation co-stimulatory receptor genes (e.g., CD28,

30

ICOS, SLAMF1) were also downregulated21. Likewise, the inhibitory and stimulatory genes

31

KLRC1, KLRC3, KLRC4 that belong to the natural killer (NK) cell lectin-like receptors of the NK

32

gene complex, and genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity, such as PRF1, SH2D1B genes, were

33

also downregulated in FIR-affected ELGANs21. Interestingly, we observed a significant overlap

5

Recent thymic emigrants consist of phenotypically and functionally immature T cells that have

6

recently egressed from the thymus, which predominate in the fetus and newborns. These cells

7

can be identified by their content of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs)22, which are DNA

8

fragments excised during the rearrangement of segments of T cell receptor (TCR) genes in the

9

thymus. TRECs are used as a measure of the number of T lymphocytes in newborns and,

10

indirectly, as an indicator of a possible thymus dysfunction. We found downregulation of the

11

genes coding for the PTK7 and S1PR1 proteins in FIR-affected ELGANs. PTK7 is a cell marker

12

of CD4+ T cell recent thymic emigrants used for assessing thymic activity23, while the S1PR1

13

receptor expression in CD4+ T cells is required for their survival and thymic emigration24.

14

Consistent with these results, FIR-affected ELGANs had significantly lower levels of TRECs in

15

the analyzed DBSs (P=0.0432; Fig. 4a, see Methods), a significantly higher postnatal neutrophil

16

to lymphocyte ratio (P=0.002; Fig. 4b), and a significantly lower percent of all leukocytes that

17

are lymphocytes at birth (P=0.012; Table 1) and during the first postnatal week25 (P=0.003; Fig.

18

4c).

19
20

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) develop under pathological conditions from myeloid

21

precursors. According to their phenotype, MDSCs can be classified into monocytic(M)-MDSCs

22

or granulocytic(G)-MDSCs. Postnatally, there is a high level of circulating MDSCs,

23

predominantly G-MDSCs, which correlates with inflammatory markers of perinatal infection26,27.

24

Neonatal MDSCs display reduced apoptosis and immunosuppressive activity after bacterial

25

infection28. Indeed, these cells are potent inhibitors of adaptive immune responses, particularly

26

of T and NK cells, by different mechanisms, including the production of reactive oxygen species

27

(ROS)29–31, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and the depletion of L-arginine by the arginase 1 enzyme

28

(ARG1)32,33. In our data, we found that the ARG1 gene was 2.5-fold upregulated in FIR-affected

29

ELGANs, as well as the OLR1 gene, encoding the lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1), a

30

marker of G-MDSCs17, which was over 10-fold upregulated. We also found a significant overlap

31

(one-tailed Fisher’s exact P < 2.2e-16, OR=26.4) between FIR upregulated genes and a G-

32

MDSC expression signature17 (Fig. 2a).

One of the mechanisms by which G-MDSCs suppress T cell responses is the release of ROS

13

molecules. We found an upregulation of genes coding for proteins essential to ROS production

14

such as CYBB, NCF1, NCF4, MPO, RAB27A, as well as genes coding for antioxidant enzymes

15

(e.g., SOD2, TXN and the Msr family -MsrA,MsrB1, MsrB2, MsrB3). Genes encoding Msr

16

proteins reduce protein methionine oxidation, a post-translational alteration that correlates with

17

oxidative stress34. In summary, our data suggest the expansion of G-MDSCs as a mechanism

contributing to the impairment of adaptive immunity in ELGANs affected by FIR, and

3

consequently, to a postnatal systemic inflammation sustained over time after birth.

Discussion

5

We have described the largest catalog to date of postnatal transcriptomic and proteomic

6

changes associated with FIR in archived DBSs from ELGANs. This catalog demonstrates that

7

archived neonatal DBSs constitute a valuable source of genome-wide molecular information

8

about the perinatal period. More importantly, we have shown that molecular changes in this

9

catalog provide clues to the underlying relationships between FIR and ISSI.

10
11

Our data provide molecular evidence of the postnatal activation of NLRC4-inflammasome

12

dependent mechanisms, which may contribute to the development of a postnatal innate immune

13

response in FIR-affected ELGANs (Fig. 5a). The NLRC4-inflammasome hyperactivity can cause

14

diverse auto-inflammatory diseases, such as the infantile-onset MAS syndrome and

15

enterocolitis. These disorders are characterized by a huge elevation of IL-18 in the blood16.

16

Recently, this protein has been proposed as a therapeutic target in neonatal sepsis35, and in

17

fact, we observed a 2-fold overexpression of the IL18 gene in FIR-affected infants. In preterm

18

newborns, Liang et. al (2017)36 reported the case of a 28-week preterm neonate with a de novo

19

gain-of-function mutation in the NLRC4 gene, who died of a fatal syndrome of excessive

20

immune activation likely to have begun in utero. NLRC4 dependent mechanisms can also

21

contribute to brain injury induced by cerebral ischemia, as has recently been described in a

22

rodent-based model of stroke37. Interestingly, caffeine therapy for the apnea of prematurity,

23

which reduces the incidence of moderate to severe neurodevelopmental disabilities in very low

24

birth weight infants38, can also reduce NLRC4-inflammasome activation39.

2

The release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β after NLRC4 inflammasome

3

activation induces the expansion, migration and activation of neutrophils (Fig. 5b). Molecular

4

alterations in neonatal neutrophils, such as a reduced expression of Fas receptors, can lead to

5

delayed neutrophil apoptosis40,41 and the persistence of proinflammatory responses42. We found

6

a significantly higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in FIR-affected ELGANs (Fig. 4b), the

7

overexpression of S100A8, S100A9, IL18, MMP8 and OLFM4, and the underexpression of

8

gasdermin B genes (Supp. Table S2). Calgranulins S100A9 and S100A8, and IL-18 can inhibit

9

neutrophil apoptosis43,44 and neutrophils can evade pyroptosis, which is mediated by gasdermin

10

family proteins45. Furthermore, the robust production of calgranulins and the activation of the IL-

11

1/IL-18 axis can trigger a neutrophil-associated inflammation-boosting loop binding to PRRs and

12

triggering downstream inflammatory signaling pathways, just as in auto-inflammatory

13

disorders46. Among children with septic shock, elevated MMP8 and OLFM4 blood gene

14

expression levels, are associated with higher rates of mortality and organ failure47,48. Similarly,

15

other studies have also shown that preterm neonates with abnormal neuroimaging studies had

16

increased blood neutrophil activation markers49,50.

17
18

The analysis of downregulated genes supports the inhibition of adaptive immune responses in

19

FIR (Fig. 1a and 3), which is consistent with the relationships we see between TRECs and FIR

20

(Fig. 4a), as well as the lymphocyte percent among ELGANs with and without FIR and MIR (Fig.

21

4c). The reduction of TRECs and the downregulation of the PTK7 and S1PR1 genes suggest a

22

thymic involution associated with FIR51, which may lead to a relative increase in

23

proinflammatory CD31-CD4+ T cells producing TNF52. Perhaps that is why thymic involution has

24

also been associated with increased risk of brain damage in ELGANs53. On the other hand, in

25

our earlier investigation4 of UC tissue from ELGANs, we found multiple upregulated genes in

26

FIR that code for proteins involved in the expansion of MDSCs (Fig. 4d). In the present study,

27

we found a significant overlap between FIR DE genes and a previously published G-MDSC

28

signature17 (Fig. 5c).

29
30

In newborns, the LTF protein appears to promote the secretion of S100A954, which can induce

31

the production of PGE2, thereby repressing the expression of LCK and ZAP70 proteins in CD4+

32

T cells, and impairing their activation30,31,55. Overall, our results suggest that FIR may induce an

33

initial prenatal pro-inflammatory-driven response (IL-6, IL1-b, CXCL8) evident in UC tissue and

34

UC blood, followed by neonatal innate immune activation mediated by the NLRC4-

35

inflammasome. As a result of these events, FIR-affected ELGANs display a robust neutrophil

2

and G-MDSC expansion during the first postnatal days, which can lead to adaptive immune

3

suppression and the onset of an auto-inflammatory loop, contributing to ISSI and consequently

4

increasing the risk of perinatal brain injury (Fig. 5d).

5
6

An important feature of G-MDSCs is the production of ROS molecules, which can lead to

7

oxidative stress and damage. Moreover, preterm newborns have a reduced antioxidant capacity

8

that increases the risk of ROS-induced damage, which is an important factor in numerous

9

diseases in premature infants, such as perinatal brain damage56. In fact, ELGANs are born with

10

deficient levels of selenium57, a cofactor for the MsrB and thioredoxin enzyme activity required

11

for proper antioxidant function. We found a 10-fold overexpression in FIR of both the OLR1

12

gene, which encodes LOX1, a marker of G-MDSCs17, and the gene coding for the heat shock

13

protein HSPA1A. HSPA1A can activate LOX1 in UC neutrophils in response to in vitro exposure

14

to microbial peptidoglycan58, leading to the downstream production of ROS. However, the LTF

15

protein, which we found to be significantly overexpressed in both transcriptomics and

16

proteomics data, can protect newborns from oxidative stress and damage by attenuating

17

inflammatory responses and controlling oxidative cell injury induced by innate immune

18

activation59.

19
20

Using well-established biomarkers, it has been shown that antenatal and postnatal

21

inflammation, the so-called two-inflammatory hit, increases the risk of perinatal brain damage in

22

preterm newborns10. Here, we found the overexpression of multiple genes encoding proteins

23

that can be associated with perinatal brain damage in FIR-exposed newborns (Fig. 5e), such as

24

LCN2, CXCL1, CXCR2, S100A8 and S100A9, as well as histone-related genes (e.g.,

25

HIST1H2BL). LCN2 is an iron-binding protein contained in neutrophil granules that is associated

26

with neuroinflammation60. Using an animal model of chorioamnionitis, Yellowhair et al. (2018)61

27

found that chorioamnionitis-induced fetal brain damage was associated with increased

28

expression of CXCL1 and CXCR2 in placental and fetal brain, and with an elevated number of

29

cerebral CXCR2+ neutrophils. With respect to calgranulins, it has been observed that the brain

30

expression of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins was increased in the brain of patients dying of

31

sepsis; specifically, S100A9 expression was required for the cerebral recruitment of neutrophils

32

and microglia activation in an animal model of sepsis62. Finally, extracellular histones can act as

33

damage-associated molecular patterns, such as calgranulins, activating inflammatory signaling

34

pathways and inducing multiple organ-specific damage63. In an animal study, histone H1 was

35

found to induce proinflammatory responses in microglia and astrocytes64,65. Remarkably, we

2

found that both the gene and protein expression of S100A9, S100A8 and HIST1H2BL, was

3

significantly higher in FIR-affected ELGANs, while our proteomics data also revealed the

4

significant overexpression of HIST1H4A and HIST1H1C (Fig. 2c,d). In summary, our findings

5

provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that trigger ISSI after FIR, which may help

6

to find new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for pathological conditions derived

7

from extreme prematurity, such as perinatal brain injury.

8

Methods

9

Study design

10

We performed a retrospective chart review of extreme preterm births (< 28 weeks of

11

gestation) at the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit

12

(NICU) between January 2010 and October 2016. Two hundred thirty-four cases born alive

13

were found. From this initial cohort, we excluded newborns from multiple pregnancies, outborn

14

deliveries and those who either died in the delivery room or within the first week after birth,

15

presented major congenital anomalies, received a blood transfusion before collecting the DBS,

16

had no histopathological examination of the placenta and umbilical cord, or whose DBS was

17

collected later than 8 days after birth. We attempted to maximize the number of individuals with

18

available biomarkers of intra-amniotic infection and inflammation, while recruiting a similar

19

number of FIR and non-FIR cases within a total maximum of 25. A final number of n=21 infants

20

met the eligibility criteria and their families provided written consent to use their DBS samples

21

for this study. At the time of processing these DBS samples, they had been stored at room

22

temperature by the Catalan newborn screening program for between 1 and 7 years. The study

23

protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona

24

(September 16th, 2016; ref. HCB/2016/0713).

25

Clinical outcomes

26

GA at birth was defined according to the first-trimester ultrasound examination. Preterm birth

27

was classified by the clinical presentation: preterm labor, preterm pre-labor rupture of

28

membranes, cervical insufficiency, placenta abruption, and preeclampsia. The laboratory results

29

of AF cultures (genital mycoplasma, aerobic and anaerobic) and IL-6 levels, as well as the

30

mother’s blood CRP, WBC and ANC at admission were also recorded; see Table 1. Clinical

31

chorioamnionitis was defined following the criteria of Gibbs66. Slides from the placenta and

32

umbilical cord were independently reviewed by two experienced pathologists blinded to

2

experimental results and previous diagnosis. Maternal (MIR) and fetal (FIR) reactions were

3

staged and graded according to published criteria1,67. Cases read discrepantly by the two

4

pathologists were simultaneously re-reviewed on a two-headed microscope in order to reach a

5

consensus (Supp. Table S1 and Supp. Fig. S1). The annotated neonatal morbidity included:

6

respiratory distress syndrome (RDS); intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH); white matter disease

7

(WMD); retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); sepsis; necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC); patent ductus

8

arteriosus (PDA); and laboratory investigations at birth, and during the first 8 days after birth

9

(CRP concentration, WBC and ANC). Hypothesis tests on clinical variables used in Table 1

10

include two-tailed Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and t-tests for those that were

11

continuous.

12

Analysis of T cell receptor excision circles

13

TREC data were obtained using the EnLite™ Neonatal TREC kit (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland),

14

which is a combination of PCR-based nucleic acid amplification and time-resolved fluorescence

15

resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) based detection. EnLite™ simultaneously detects two

16

targets, TREC and beta-actin, the latter used as an internal control for monitoring specimen

17

amplification in each test. The assay involves DNA elution from 1.5mm DBS punches,

18

amplification and hybridization with target-sequence specific probes, and quantifies TREC levels

19

by measuring probe fluorescence with the Victor Enlite™ fluorometer (PerkinElmer). A full

20

calibration curve with blanks and three DBS calibrators was run in triplicate on each plate. A

21

low-TREC control, a no-TREC control, a high-TREC control, and a blank paper disk (containing

22

no blood), were used as quality controls for each plate. Raw fluorescence counts, measured at

23

615 nm, 665 nm, and 780 nm, were processed by the EnLite™ workstation software to produce

24

corrected fluorescence counts. TREC and beta-actin copies/µL were predicted from corrected

25

fluorescent counts by the EnLite™ workstation software using an unweighted linear regression

26

model on the ArcSinh transformation of the DBS calibrator copies/µL response.

27
28

The values for the number of TREC copies/µL are sensitive to technical effects associated with

29

the run in which they are obtained; for this reason, we generated technical replicates for the

30

same individuals in different runs. Because of limited DBS availability, we could not produce

31

more than one TREC read-out for all individuals and not all individuals with multiple readouts

32

had the same number of replicated measurements. For this reason, we used a linear mixed-

33

effects model to test the effect of FIR on the TREC read-out, using the newborn identifier as a

34

random effect variable to account for replicated measurements across individuals. We used the

18

2

logarithm of the corrected fluorescent counts as TREC read-out instead of the predicted number

3

of copies/µL, as these more accurately reflect the measurements made by the instrument and

4

its technical biases. In this linear mixed-effects model, the FIR stage was the main explanatory

5

variable, and aside from the random effect of the newborn, other covariates that entered as

6

main factors in the model were sex, maximum lymphocyte count during the first postnatal week,

7

and a batch indicator variable identifying the run of the TREC measurement. This linear mixed-

8

effects model, as well as a null one without the FIR stage, were fitted to the data using the R

9

package lme468.

10
11

A chi-squared test with one degree of freedom between the two models gave a P value=0.0432,

12

thus rejecting the hypothesis of no FIR effect at a significance level α < 0.05. Adjusted and

13

corrected fluorescent counts on a logarithmic scale (shown in Figure 4a) were obtained after

14

removing the effect of the previous covariates using a linear model.

15

RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing

16

We used a scalpel to cut a surface of approximately 25 square millimeters from DBS samples in

17

Guthrie cards, using a different scalpel blade for each sample to avoid contamination. RNA was

18

then extracted using the illustraTM RNAspin Mini Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare) following the

19

supplier’s protocol and eluting the sample in a final volume of 30 µl. The quality and quantity of

20

the RNA was assessed with an RNA Pico chip in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer equipment. Next,

21

globin mRNA and ribosomal RNA were removed using the Globin Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit

22

(Illumina), and its performance was checked using with an RNA Pico chip in an Agilent 2100

23

Bioanalyzer equipment. Libraries were prepared using the NebNext UltraTM II Directional RNA

24

Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs), following the specific protocol for rRNA depleted FFPE

25

RNA and using 12 PCR cycles for library amplification. Libraries were validated and their

26

concentration was measured with a High Sensitivity DNA chip in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

27

Finally, we prepared a pooled library with a normalized concentration for each sample. The final

28

concentration of the pool was measured by Real-Time PCR using the NGS Library

29

Quantification Kit (Takara). We loaded a final concentration of 1.9 pM into a NextSeq-500 High

30

Output run with 2×75 cycles using 4 sequencing lanes per library. The resulting 21×4=84

31

paired-end FASTQ files have been deposited to the European Genome-Phenome Archive with

32

the study identifier EGAS00001003635.

Pre-processing and differential expression analysis of transcriptomics RNA-seq data

3

We performed quality control on the 84 raw paired-end reads using FastQC and did not detect

4

artifacts in the sequence data. We did observe, however, that one of the samples, BS13, was

5

sequenced at about 4 times more depth than the rest of the samples. The reason for this higher

6

depth was a wrong normalization step during library preparation that led to a higher

7

concentration of RNA in that sequenced library. To adjust for this bias in sequencing depth we

8

downsampled uniformly at random the paired-end reads from the library to ¼ of its original

9

depth.

Raw paired-end reads in FASTQ files, including the downsampled version of BS13, were

12

aligned to the GRCh38 version of the reference human genome, without alternate locus

13

scaffolds (GCA_000001405.15) and including human decoy sequences from hs38d1

14

(GCA_000786075.2), using STAR69 version 2.6.0c with default parameters except for --

15

peOverlapNbasesMin 10 and --sjdbOverhang 74, producing an initial set of 84 BAM

16

files. Aligned reads in BAM files were reduced to a table of counts of 25,221 genes by 84

17

samples using gene annotations from GENCODE v24 and the R/Bioconductor package

18

GenomeAlignments70 version 1.16.0, and its function summarizeOverlaps. We used specific

19

arguments in the call to this function to restrict the count of genic reads to only those that fell

20

entirely within the exonic regions and aligned to a unique site on the genome, to reflect library

21

preparation protocols and avoid counting reads without a matching pair or overlapping multiple

22

features.

23
24

The rest of the analysis of transcriptomics data was based on the edgeR71 and limma72

25

pipelines, and a few other R packages from the Bioconductor project73 release version 3.7. A

26

multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot of the samples showed a nearly perfect agreement

27

between libraries from the same sample sequenced in each of the 4 different lanes. For this

28

reason, we merged BAM files with aligned reads from the same sample and built a new table of

29

counts of 25,221 genes by 21 samples, using the previously employed reduction procedure.

30

Considering that 6 out of the 21 infants were not diagnosed with MIR or FIR (Supp. Fig. S1),

31

and following previously established recommendations74, we filtered out lowly-expressed genes

32

by discarding those that did not show a minimum reliable level of expression of 10 counts per

33

million reads of the smallest library size, in less than 6 samples. This filtering step led to a final

34

table of counts of 11,279 genes by 21 samples.

We used TMM normalization75 to produce the MDS plot shown in Figure 1c, as well as to obtain

3

gene-level robust dispersion estimates76 that helped to select the sex of the infant and surrogate

4

variables calculated with SVA77, as covariates in the linear models employed for differential

5

expression analysis. Finally, we used the limma-voom78 pipeline with quality weights, combined

6

with quantile normalization, to conduct the differential expression analysis using linear models.

7

The design matrix included the FIR status of the infants as a main explanatory variable and sex

8

and surrogate variables, estimated with SVA, as covariates.

9
10

The differential expression analysis across different combined stages of inflammation in MIR

11

and FIR (Supp. Fig. S6, Supp. Table S4) was based on our replacing the FIR status variable in

12

the linear model, with numerical values for MIR and FIR. Specifically, we assigned a 0 when

13

MIR and FIR were not present, 1 when MIR was present but FIR was not, 2 when MIR was

14

stage III and FIR was stage I and, finally, 3 when MIR was stage III and FIR was stage II or III.

15

Pre-processing and differential expression analysis of transcriptomics microarray data

16

We obtained from Nigel Paneth and collaborators at the Michigan State University raw

17

microarray gene expression data files from paired frozen and unfrozen DBS samples from nine

18

neonates of the US ELGAN cohort, where two were affected by FIR and seven were not. The

19

n=18 corresponding samples had been hybridized on a Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene

20

Expression 8x60K Microarray Kit, and their analysis comparing the number of expressed genes

21

between frozen and unfrozen samples was published by Wei et al. (2014)15. Batch processing

22

information was derived from the scanning timestamp stored in raw data files as previously

23

described79, creating a batch indicator variable that divided the samples into two different

24

batches. The cross-classification of infants by FIR status and batch indicator showed no

25

correlation between the primary outcome of our analysis, FIR status, and sample batch

26

processing (Supp. Fig. S4). The MDS plot of the data shows the effect of storage temperature

27

and batch processing, but not sex (Supp. Fig. S4).

28
29

We corrected background expression intensities using the “normexp” method in the function

30

backgroundCorrect from the limma package80, and used a quantile normalization approach to

31

obtain comparable gene expression distributions across the samples. We removed probesets

32

without annotation to Entrez gene identifiers, and probesets annotated to a common Entrez

33

gene, keeping the one with highest variability measured by interquartile range (IQR). We then

34

discarded the Agilent positive control probes and retained initially the negative control probes to

21

2

later estimate the fraction of expressed genes per sample. This resulted in an expression data

3

set of 21,952 probesets in one-to-one correspondence with Entrez genes after discarding

4

negative control probes, by n = 18 samples. We calculated the 95% quantile of the expression

5

level distribution observed in negative control probes for each sample. As a function of the

6

percentage of increase over the 95% quantile of negative probe expression (from 100% to

7

200% increasing by 10%), we found the number of expressed genes per sample separately by

8

storage condition, which we later used for non-specific filtering based on minimum expression.

9
10

Using the software package SVA77 and the top 1% most variable (IQR) genes, we estimated

11

one surrogate variable covariate that captures variability unrelated to FIR, storage temperature

12

and batch processing. For each gene, we defined a linear mixed-effects model where the

13

expression profile of every gene is a linear function of FIR status (yes/no, main explanatory

14

variable), storage temperature (frozen/unfrozen), batch processing, the estimated surrogate

15

variable covariate and the infant as a random effect. We estimated array quality weights to

16

down-weight samples of worse quality in a graduated way81 and to avoid discarding them. Using

17

limma, we fitted this linear mixed-effects model, including the array quality weights, to each

18

gene expression profile. We then we calculated moderated t-statistics, squeezing the genewise

19

residual variances towards a global trend, for the coefficient estimating the effect between FIR

20

and non–FIR-affected infants, and their corresponding P values for the null hypothesis of no-

21

differential expression. We selected initially different subsets of DE genes at 5% FDR according

22

to different thresholds of the non-specific filtering on minimum expression and, within each non-

23

specific filter, FDR-adjusted P values were re-calculated. We found that a 110% cutoff yielded

24

the highest number of DE genes, and using this non-specific filter we readjusted the raw P

25

values and obtained 33 genes that changed significantly at 5% FDR by 50% or more, between

26

newborns affected and unaffected by FIR.

27

Mass spectrometry proteomics

28

Sample preparation for mass spectrometry: DBS samples were excised and collected in a 2 mL

29

eppendorf, and extracted as described previously82. Briefly, each sample was soaked with 970

30

µl of a solution consisting of 758 µl of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 113 µl of 10% (w/v)

31

sodium deoxycholate and 99 µl of 5 mM tris(2-carboxytethyl)phosphine, which was incubated at

32

60 ºC during 1h in constant agitation. Samples were alkylated with 10 µM iodacetamide (37ºC,

33

30 min) and quenched with 10 µM dithiothreitol (37ºC, 30 min). Samples were digested with

34

trypsin (40 ng/µl) overnight at 37 ºC. Digestion was stopped with formic acid, and samples were

2

vortexed and centrifuged (800 xg, 20 min) prior to supernatant desalting using spin C18

3

columns.

4
5

Mass spectrometry data acquisition: Samples were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid and were

6

analyzed on a Orbitrap Fusion Lumos with an EASY-Spray nanosource coupled to a nano-

7

UPLC system (EASY-nanoLC 1000 liquid chromatograph) equipped with a 50-cm C18 column

8

(EASY-Spray; 75 µm id, PepMap RSLC C18, 2 mm particles, 45 ºC). Chromatographic

9

gradients were started at 5% buffer B with a flow rate of 300 nL/min and gradually increased to

10

22% buffer B in 79 min and to 32% in 11 minutes. After each analysis, the column was washed

11

for 10 min with 95% buffer B (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water. Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in

12

acetonitrile). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode, with full

13

MS scans over a mass range of m/z 350–1500 with detection in the Orbitrap (120K resolution)

14

and with auto gain control (AGC) set to 100,000. In each cycle of data-dependent acquisition

15

analysis, following each survey scan, the most intense ions above a threshold ion count of

16

10,000 were selected for fragmentation with HCD at normalized collision energy of 28%. The

17

number of selected precursor ions for fragmentation was determined by the “Top Speed”

18

acquisition algorithm (max cycle time of 3 seconds), and a dynamic exclusion of 60 s was set.

19

Fragment ion spectra were acquired in the ion trap with an AGC of 10,000 and a maximum

20

injection time of 200 ms. One of the samples, BS04, could not be profiled for technical reasons.

21

All data were acquired with Xcalibur software v4.1.

22
23

Mass spectrometry protein expression quantification: The MaxQuant software suite (v1.6.2.6)

24

was used for peptide identification and label-free protein quantification83. The data were

25

searched against the Uniprot human database with decoy entries (as of April 2018, 42,518

26

entries). A precursor ion mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm at the MS1 level was used, and up to two

27

missed cleavages for trypsin were allowed. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da.

28

Oxidation of methionine, protein acetylation at the N-terminal were defined as variable

29

modification; whereas carbamidomethylation on cysteines was set as a fixed modification. The

30

minimum number of razor and unique peptides (“min. razor + unique”) for a protein group to be

31

considered as identified was set to 1. Identified peptides and proteins were filtered using a 5%

32

FDR. The match between runs algorithm was activated with a tolerance of 0.7 min for the

33

matching time window and 20 min for the alignment time window. The mass spectrometry

34

proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE84

35

partner repository with accession number PXD011626.

Pre-processing and differential expression analysis of proteomics data

3

From the initial set of 649 quantified protein expression profiles on 20 samples, we discarded 26

4

whose protein identifier could not be mapped to one of the 25,221 genes profiled by RNA-seq.

5

From the remaining 624 proteins, we selected 303 with protein quantification values in at least 6

6

out of the 20 samples. We further discarded 48 proteins whose protein quantification values

7

were based on one single peptide, leading to a final protein quantification data matrix of 245

8

proteins by 20 samples. Raw protein quantifications were normalized using the vsn85,86

9

R/Bioconductor package. A complete normalized matrix of protein expression values was

10

obtained by imputing missing quantifications with a multivariate method87 based on the

11

expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm implemented in the function impute.wrapper.MLE from

12

the R package imputeLCMD. Using this complete and normalized matrix of protein expression

13

values as an input to the edgeR71 and limma-trend76 pipelines, we produced the MDS plot in

14

Figure 1d and conducted a protein differential expression analysis with linear models shown in

15

Figure 2c. The design matrix included the FIR status of infants as the main explanatory variable

16

and sex as a covariate.

17

Functional enrichment analysis with the Gene Ontology database

18

We performed functional enrichment analysis with the GO database using the R/Bioconductor

19

package GOstats88. More concretely, we used the biological process ontology and the

20

conditional hypergeometric test to account for dependencies derived from the GO hierarchical

21

structure. Under this procedure, the GO hierarchy is traversed towards the root, applying a one-

22

tailed Fisher’s exact test between the genes in the GO term and the DE gene set at hand. When

23

a GO term is considered to be significantly enriched by the DE gene set, its genes are removed

24

from parent GO terms before testing them. To consider a GO term as significantly enriched we

25

used a P value cutoff of 0.01, a minimum OR of 1.5, a minimum of five and a maximum of 300

26

genes in the GO term. The gene universe was defined by the entire set of 25,221 profiled genes

27

by RNA-seq. To report only the most robustly enriched biological processes, the final set of

28

significantly enriched GO terms was selected by first using a multiple testing correction of FDR

29

< 10% on the whole set of tested GO terms, then by further selecting GO terms with OR > 1.5

30

and a minimum number of five genes enriching the GO term.
