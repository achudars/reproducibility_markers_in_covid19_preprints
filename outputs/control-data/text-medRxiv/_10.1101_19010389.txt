SUMMARY
Tensor fasciae suralis (TFS) is an accessory muscle of the posterior lower extremity.
Although TFS has been documented in cadaveric and radiological reports, its prevalence remains
unknown. The TFS variant is noteworthy to anatomists, as it may be encountered in the
dissection laboratory, and clinicians, as the muscle could potentially cause confusion during
physical examination or diagnostic imaging. Multiple variations of TFS have been reported in
the literature, suggesting the need for a classification system. We dissected 236 formalin-fixed
cadaveric lower limbs to determine the prevalence of TFS. The PubMed and MEDLINE
databases were searched to compare the anatomical features of independent TFS case reports. In
our prevalence study, the TFS muscle was identified in three lower limbs (1.3%). In total, 35
cases of TFS (31 cadaveric and four radiological) were identified in the literature. Our literature
review revealed that the accessory muscle most often arises as a single head from the long head
of the biceps femoris, yet many other presentations have been documented. The need for a
classification system to distinguish between the subtypes of TFS became apparent during the
literature review. Tensor fasciae suralis is a rare muscle, present in only 3 of 236 (1.3%)
cadaveric lower limbs dissected in this study. We propose the use of a classification system,
based on muscle origin and number of heads, to better organize the subtypes of TFS.

INTRODUCTION
Tensor fasciae suralis (ischioaponeuroticus) is an accessory muscle of the posterior thigh
and popliteal fossa. This supernumerary muscle can arise from various locations within the
posterior thigh and inserts into the deep (sural, crural) fascia of the leg, gastrocnemius, or
calcaneal tendon1. It has been suggested that TFS functions in leg flexion, although electrical
studies have not been conducted to confirm this hypothesis2. As related by Schaeffer3, the first
case of TFS was reported by Kelch4 and since then relatively few cadaveric2,3,5–25 reports of TFS
have been published. We aimed to determine the prevalence of TFS by dissecting the posterior
thighs and popliteal fossae of 236 cadaveric lower limbs. A literature review was conducted to
assess the anatomical features of TFS that have been published in cadaveric and radiological case
reports. A classification system that is focused on the muscle’s proximal attachment(s) is put
forth herein to organize the subtypes of TFS. We also suggest that an often-used definition of
TFS be modified and challenge the claim that the semitendinosus muscle is the most common
point of origin of TFS. The clinical relevance of the accessory muscle is discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Prevalence Study
This study was exempt from IRB approval at University of Western States. As part of
routine educational dissection, the lower limbs of 118 formalin-fixed cadavers (n = 236) were
examined for the presence of the TFS muscle. The donor cadavers were of mixed demographics;
there were 74 males (age range = 18-100 years) and 44 females (age range = 37-97 years).

The following keywords were searched in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases: tensor
fasciae suralis, ischioaponeuroticus, (variant OR variation OR anomaly AND posterior thigh OR
popliteal fossa). Relevant publications were sought out in the reference lists of sources identified
in the PubMed and MEDLINE searches. Muscle variants that arose from one or more of the
hamstring muscles and inserted into the deep fascia of the leg, gastrocnemius, or calcaneal
tendon were considered TFS. The authors have referenced original communications wherever
possible, however secondary sources were used when primary sources could not be located. The
following case reports were not included in the literature review: 1) a muscle that arose from the
belly of semitendinosus and inserted into the peroneal retinaculum, peroneal trochlea of the
calcaneus, and tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal that was determined to be the authors to be
TFS26. We do not believe that this muscle variant was in fact TFS as its insertion points are not
consistent with a muscle that could tense the sural fascia. 2) A different group related a case of
TFS that was identified in a patient using MRI and stated that the same muscle variant was seen
in an additional three patients27. Specific details related to the origin, insertion, and course of
these four TFS cases were not explicitly discussed and as such they were excluded from the
literature review. 3) the original communication (reported by Pardi28 and referenced by Barry
and Bothroyd23) of a muscle that was likely TFS could not be located, nor could materials that
discuss significant details of the case. Lastly 4), a unique supernumerary muscle of the popliteal
fossa (termed femeroaponeuroticus by the authors) was excluded from this study as the muscle in
question arose from the femur and was innervated by the common peroneal nerve29.

Of the 236 lower limbs included in this dataset, three TFS muscles were identified. One
donor cadaver featured bilateral TFS muscles (Case 1). This case was previously reported by the
authors of the current study17. A second donor cadaver featured the muscle variant in the left
posterior thigh and popliteal fossa, but the right side was grossly unremarkable (Case 2).

Case 1 – 51-year-old male, height: 175 cm, weight: 68 kg.
The TFS muscles identified in the posterior thighs and popliteal fossae of this cadaver
were symmetrical. Each muscle arose from the long head of the biceps femoris by a fascial slip
that measured approximately 3.3 cm in length (Fig. 1) and featured a fusiform muscle belly that
was approximately 12.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm in greatest dimensions. Each TFS muscle inserted into the
fascia of the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle.

Case 2 – 68-year-old male, height: 178 cm, weight: 70 kg.
The left posterior thigh and popliteal fossa contained a TFS muscle that arose from the
long head of the biceps femoris approximately 18.5 cm distal to the common hamstring tendon
(Fig. 2). The fusiform muscle belly was long and flat and measured approximately 22.0 x 1.0 x
0.3 cm in greatest dimensions. The TFS muscle inserted into the sural fascia overlying the
medial head of the gastrocnemius. The distal aspect of the muscle belly and fascial insertion of
TFS were located immediately posterior to the medial sural cutaneous nerve.

Literature Review
A total of 31 cadaveric cases (25 unilateral, three bilateral) and four radiological cases
(all unilateral) were identified in the literature. Unilateral cases were right-sided in 15 instances,
left-sided in 10 instances, and not specified in four instances. Interestingly, the accessory muscle
was found in only three female lower extremities compared to 25 male lower extremities (sex not
specified in seven cases).
We propose a classification system (Table 1) to categorize the subtypes of TFS whereby
the origin of the accessory muscle and number of heads present are used as distinguishing
characteristics. The classification system is summarized below:
Type I – a one-headed TFS muscle which takes origin from the a) long head of biceps femoris, b)
semitendinosus, or c) short head of biceps femoris.
Type II – a two-headed TFS muscle, with a medial head from semitendinosus and a lateral head
from the long head of biceps femoris.
Type III – a TFS muscle that does not fit the criteria of the Type I or Type II subtypes.
Cases determined to be TFS are summarized in Table 2. When TFS arises as a single
head (28 instances), it most commonly does so from the long head of the biceps femoris (15
instances), followed by the semitendinosus (11 instances), and short-head of the biceps femoris
(two instances). When TFS arises as two heads (six instances), it typically does so from the long
head of biceps femoris and semitendinosus (four instances), but other variations have been
reported21,23. The accessory muscle arose from three heads in one case; each head took origin
from a different hamstring muscle9. The most common insertion of TFS was the sural fascia,
followed by the gastrocnemius, and lastly the calcaneal tendon. Several authors have reported
that TFS is innervated by the tibial nerve2,3,7–11,13,14,16,23,25 . The muscle’s blood supply has been

noted to be from a branch of the femoral artery23 or a branch of the 4th perforating artery of the
profunda femoris10. We did not investigate the neurovascular supply of the TFS muscles that
were identified in the current study.

DISCUSSION
Tensor fasciae suralis is considered a rare muscle. We report its prevalence to be 1.3%
based on dissection of 236 lower limbs. In a report of a case of TFS8, the authors noted that the
muscle was not seen in a study of 300 cadaveric limbs in which the popliteal fossae were
dissected to identify muscular and neurovascular variations30. To the best of our knowledge the
present work is the first study dedicated to determining the prevalence of TFS.
Based on the literature, we propose a classification system for the subtypes of TFS. The
proximal attachments of TFS and number of heads present were used as defining criteria to
differentiate between subtypes. With few exceptions, the insertion of TFS (regardless of subtype)
was the deep fascia of the leg, gastrocnemius, or calcaneal tendon. If adapted, this naming
convention could help dispel misconceptions that are associated with TFS. For instance, TFS has
been said to arise most commonly from the semitendinosus muscle13,31,32 or solely from
semitendinosus without mention of the muscle’s other possible origins12,27,33. Based on the
literature such an origin from semitendinosus is slightly less common than an origin from the
long head of biceps femoris, and therefore we suggest that these subtypes be termed Ib and Ia,
respectively. A second misconception related to TFS revolves around the definition of the
muscle itself. The name “tensor fasciae suralis (ischioaponeuroticus) has been given to a
muscular slip passing from one or other of the hamstring muscles to the fascia of the back of the
leg”34. Interestingly, this description of TFS was included within a portion of text that was

dedicated to variations of the semimembranosus muscle. Quain’s definition of TFS was
referenced by Barry and Bothroyd23 in their seminal report of the muscle variant, which appears
to have cemented the notion that TFS can arise from any hamstring muscle. However, none of
the reports summarized in this work describe the semimembranosus as the sole proximal
attachment of TFS. Only one case involves semimembranosus at all; an unusual three-headed
TFS case where one of the heads took origin from semimembranosus9. To make matters more
confusing, a case of an “accessory semimembranosus” muscle (which arose from the
semimembranosus, coursed through the popliteal fossa, and inserted at the proximal portion of
the medial head of the gastrocnemius) has been reported35. One could argue that this muscle was
tensor fasciae suralis instead of accessory semimembranosus. The long-standing notion that TFS
can arise from any hamstring muscle does not seem to be reinforced by the literature, and as such
we do not include within our classification system a distinction for a subtype of TFS that arises
solely from semimembranosus.
The way TFS emerges and persists during development is not clear. It has been suggested
that TFS represents a muscular persistence of embryological fibrous connections that span the
tendon of biceps femoris and the deep fascia of the leg10. A particularly interesting case of
identical twin fetuses was reported by Mogi25: TFS was present in the right popliteal fossa of one
twin and a third head of the gastrocnemius was present in the right popliteal fossa of the other
twin. This rare case may suggest that TFS and the third head of gastrocnemius have a similar
developmental origin. The manner in which TFS attaches to the crural fascia is similar to
muscles found in some mammals1,22.
Tensor fasciae suralis is not strictly of interest to anatomists as it does have clinical
implications in certain instances. The muscle may present as a painless mass of the popliteal

fossa27,33, which could lead to unexpected findings during physical examination32,36. While rare,
athletic injuries of TFS have been reported. It is speculated that TFS may cause compressive
injuries of the popliteal vein8 and the sciatic, tibial, and sural nerves13. With respect to Case 2 of
the present work, the position of the distal aspect of TFS relative to the median sural nerve
suggests that this nerve could potentially be compressed by TFS.
Tensor fasciae suralis is a rare supernumerary muscle of the posterior thigh and popliteal
fossa. We report three TFS muscles that were identified in a study of 236 formalin-fixed
cadaveric lower limbs (prevalence = 1.3%). Based on the literature, we suggest a classification
system to organize the subtypes of TFS.

Notable variants of the popliteal fossa are briefly discussed below for comparison with
tensor fasciae suralis:

Third head of the gastrocnemius (gastrocnemius tertius, caput tertium of Kelch)
The third head of the gastrocnemius is the most common variation of the gastrocnemius muscle.
The third head may be large and bulky, or it may be tendinous and inconspicuous. The reported
prevalence of the third head of the gastrocnemius has varied from 1.9%1 to 5.5%2. A range of
possibilities exist with respect to the accessory head’s proximal attachment(s), distal
attachment(s), and course relative to the popliteal neurovascular bundle. Twelve variations of the
third head of the gastrocnemius have been reported3.

Accessory plantaris (bicipital plantaris of Hall)
The accessory plantaris muscle belly may arise from a range of sites and typically fuses with the
muscle belly of plantaris4–6. In a retrospective review of 1000 consecutive MRI exams of patients
with chronic or acute knee issues, the accessory plantaris muscle was identified in 63 patients
(6.3%)4. In a recent cadaveric study, the accessory plantaris muscle was found in 3 of 50 limbs
(6%)5.

Accessory popliteus (of Fabrice, popliteus biceps)
Accessory popliteus is a rare variant that exhibits a range of potential origins (lateral femoral
condyle, lateral head of gastrocnemius, capsule of the knee joint, or posterior cruciate ligament)
and inserts near the soleal line on the medial portion of the tibia6. According to Bartoníček,

Gruber identified an accessory popliteus in 11 of 695 dissected limbs (1.6%)7. An MRI report of
what was likely accessory popliteus has been published8.

Transverse muscle of popliteal fossa
Several authors have documented an anomalous muscle that passes transversely through the
popliteal fossa, spanning the tendon of biceps femoris and the medial head of the gastrocnemius
9–11

. Despite the similarities between these cases, the innervation of the muscle has been found to

be from the common fibular nerve9,10, tibial nerve11, or lateral sural cutaneous nerve12. This
transverse muscle of the popliteal fossa lacks an agreed upon name. It has been speculated to be
a conversion of fascia lata into muscle9, a derivation from the short head of biceps femoris10, or a
variation of the third head of the gastrocnemius13. Although similar in its attachments, this
transverse muscle is fundamentally different than TFS as the latter passes longitudinally through
the popliteal fossa and not transversely like the former.
