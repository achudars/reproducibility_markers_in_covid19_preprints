Abstract
Across decades of co-circulation in humans, influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused
seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of cases and mortality. H3N2 causes the
majority of relatively severe, clinically attended cases in high-risk elderly cohorts, and the majority of
overall deaths, whereas H1N1 causes fewer deaths overall, and cases shifted towards young and middleaged adults. These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood exposure to H1N1
and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes. Here we analyze a large
epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal
influenza epidemiology, and if so, whether it acts primarily via immune memory of a particular influenza
subtype or via broader immune memory that protects across subtypes. We also test the impact of
evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of cases. Likelihood-based
model comparison shows that narrow, within-subtype imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk alongside
age-specific risk factors. The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate, or of broadly
protective imprinting that acts across subtypes. Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can
imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes, and that these cohort-specific
biases shape epidemic age distributions. As a result, newer and less “senior” antibody responses acquired
later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood. Finally,
we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades, as
cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age.

Influenza viruses of subtype H1N1 and H3N2 both cause seasonal epidemics in humans, but with
different age-specific impacts. H3N2 causes a greater proportion of cases in older adults than H1N1, and
more deaths overall. People tend to gain the strongest immune memory of influenza viruses encountered
in childhood, and so differences in H1N1 and H3N2’s age-specific impacts may reflect that individuals
born in different eras of influenza circulation have been imprinted with different immunological risk
profiles. Another idea is that H3N2 may be more able to infect immunologically experienced adults
because it evolves slightly faster than H1N1 and can more quickly escape immune memory. We analyzed
a large epidemiological data set and found the clearest signal that birth year-specific differences in
childhood immune imprinting, not differences in evolutionary rate, explain differences in H1N1 and
H3N2’s age-specific impacts. These results can help epidemiologists understand how epidemic risk from
specific influenza subtypes is distributed across the population and predict how population risk may shift
as differently imprinted birth years grow older. Further, these results provide immunological clues to
which facets of immune memory become biased in childhood, and then later play a strong role in
protection during seasonal influenza epidemics.

Introduction

56
57

Childhood influenza exposures leave an immunological imprint, which has reverberating, lifelong

58

impacts on immune memory. Foundational work on original antigenic sin (1) and antigenic seniority (2)

59

showed that individuals maintain the highest antibody titers against influenza strains encountered in

60

childhood. But how these serological patterns map to functional immune protection, and shape birth year-

61

specific risk during outbreaks, remains an active area of inquiry. One open question is the breadth of

62

cross-protection provided by immune memory imprinted in childhood.

63

We define immune imprinting as a lifelong bias in immune memory of, and protection against,

64

the strains encountered in childhood. Such biases most likely become entrenched as subsequent exposures

65

back-boost existing memory responses, rather than stimulating true de novo responses (3). By providing

66

particularly robust protection against certain antigenic subtypes, or clades, imprinting can provide

67

immunological benefits, but perhaps at the cost of equally strong protection against variants encountered

68

later in life. For example, every modern influenza pandemic has spared certain birth cohorts, presumably

69

due to cross-protective memory primed in childhood (4–10). Recently, we showed that imprinting also

70

protects against novel, emerging avian influenza viruses of the same phylogenetic group as the first

71

childhood exposure (9,11). Imprinting may additionally shape birth year-specific risk from seasonal

72

influenza (12–14), but the importance of broadly protective immunity remains unclear in this context.

73

Until recently, narrow cross-protective immunity specific to variants of a single hemagglutinin

74

(HA) subtype has been considered the primary mode of defense against seasonal influenza. Lymphocyte

75

memory of variable epitopes on the HA head (i.e. sites at which hemagglutinin antigens of different

76

subtypes show limited homology) drives this narrow, within-subtype protection, which is the main

77

mechanism of protection from the inactivated influenza vaccine. But a growing body of evidence shows

78

protection may also be driven by memory of other influenza antigens (e.g. neuraminidase, NA) (15–17),

79

or by immune response to conserved epitopes, many of which are found on the HA stalk (11,18–21).

80

(Antibodies that target conserved HA epitopes can provide broad protection across multiple HA subtypes

81

in the same phylogenetic group (18,20,22), where HA group 1 contains hemagglutinin subtypes H1 and

82

H2, while group 2 contains H3 (11,19,23). H1, H2 and H3 are the only HA subtypes that have circulated

83

seasonally in humans since 1918.)

84

Together, these insights suggest that within a single host, imprinting probably induces multiple

85

levels of bias in immune memory, to both conserved (broadly protective) and variable (narrowly

86

protective) sites on various influenza antigens. The functional role of any single layer of imprinted

87

immune memory depends on both immunodominance hierarchies and epidemic context. Here, we

88

examine which layers of imprinted memory impact risk from seasonal influenza.

89

Within-subtype immunity to HA is known to shape seasonal influenza’s epidemiology and

90

evolution (24). But because this type of narrow immunity decays rapidly in the face of antigenic drift, it

91

would not be expected to shape cohort-specific imprinting protection across an entire human lifetime

92

(25,26). Conversely, broad, HA group-level immune memory arises when lymphocytes target conserved

93

HA epitopes. Responses to these conserved epitopes should be stable over time, and can play a strong

94

role in defense against unfamiliar influenza strains (e.g. novel, avian or pandemic subtypes

95

(11,18,20,22,27,28)). Broad, HA group-level responses are not traditionally thought to play a strong role

96

in defense against familiar, seasonal influenza subtypes, but have recently been identified as an

97

independent correlate of protection against seasonal influenza (21), and might play a particularly strong

98

role against drifted seasonal strains whose variable HA epitopes have become unrecognizable. Thus,

99

childhood immune imprinting may determine which birth cohorts are primed for effective defense against

100

seasonal strains with conserved HA epitopes characteristic of group 1 or group 2, or with variable HA

101

epitopes characteristic of a particular subtype (H1, H2, etc.). A similar line of reasoning may apply to

102

immunity against NA, although much less attention has been paid to this antigen.

103

Since 1977, two distinct subtypes of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2, have circulated seasonally in

104

humans, with striking but poorly understood differences in their age-specific impact (9,12–14,29). These

105

differences could be associated with childhood imprinting: older cohorts were almost certainly exposed to

106

H1N1 in childhood (since it was the only subtype circulating in humans from 1918-1957), and now seem

107

to be preferentially protected against modern seasonal H1N1 variants (9,12–14). Likewise, younger adults

108

have the highest probabilities of childhood imprinting to H3N2 (Fig. 1), which is consistent with

109

relatively low numbers of clinically attended H3N2 cases in these cohorts. Alternatively, differences in

110

the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1 and H3N2 could explain the observed age profiles. Subtype H3N2

111

exhibits slightly faster drift in its antigenic phenotype than H1N1, and as a result, H3N2 may be better

112

able to escape pre-existing immunity in immunologically experienced adults, whereas H1N1 may be

113

relatively restricted to causing cases in immunologically inexperienced children (30).

114

We analyzed a large surveillance data set of relatively severe, clinically attended influenza cases

115

to test whether cohort effects from childhood imprinting primarily act against variable epitopes, only

116

providing narrow cross-protection against closely related HA or NA variants of the same subtype, or

117

against more conserved epitopes, providing broad cross-protection across HA subtypes in the same

118

phylogenetic group (Fig. 1A-B). We fitted a suite of models to data using maximum likelihood and

119

compared models using AIC. In a separate analysis, we considered the hypothesis that differences in

120

evolutionary rate of H1N1 and H3N2, rather than imprinting effects, shape differences in age distribution.

121

Our results have implications for long-term projections of seasonal influenza risk in elderly cohorts (13),

122

who suffer the heaviest burdens of influenza-related morbidity and mortality, and whose imprinting status

123

will shift through time as cohorts born during different inter-pandemic eras grow older.

124
125

The Data

126

The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) provided a dataset containing 9,510

127

seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 cases from their statewide surveillance system. Cases of all ages were

128

confirmed to subtype by PCR and/or culture, primarily from virologic testing at the Arizona State Public

129

Health Laboratory (ASPHL). The ADHS surveillance system aims to characterize circulating strains from

130

patients across the state with medically attended influenza. Although surveillance does not target specific

131

at-risk groups, relatively severe cases (especially those tested at hospital labs) are overrepresented in our

132

data, as these cases are most likely to be medically attended and confirmed to subtype, thus meeting our

133

study inclusion criteria. This is because confirmation to subtype requires a second-line test (PCR or

134

culture); rapid tests are more common, but do not indicate subtype.

135

Although the exact collection setting of individual specimens was not always recorded, ADHS

136

staff internally reviewed reporting source and provider organization of cases in our data to estimate that

137

roughly 76% were reported and/or submitted by hospital labs or may have originated at hospital-

138

associated outpatient clinics. A previous ADHS analysis of subtyped 2016 influenza A data matched to

139

hospital discharge data found that nearly half of cases reported from hospital labs (if extrapolated to other

140

seasons, roughly 38% of the overall data) were severe enough to warrant hospital admission. The rest

141

(also roughly 38% of the overall data, if extrapolated) were discharged without admission. To obtain a

142

broader representation of clinically attended cases from across the state, ADHS collaborates with county

143

health departments, commercial laboratories, and outpatient clinics to receive specimens. We estimate

144

that roughly 8% of the data originated in outpatient settings. The remaining 17% of cases were either

145

tested at commercial labs, or were tested at ASPHL, but with unknown origin. Ultimately, these data

146

allow us to analyze drivers of relatively severe, clinically attended cases, but our results cannot be

147

assumed to generalize to mild or asymptomatic cases.

148

Cases were observed across 22 years of influenza surveillance, from the 1993-1994 influenza

149

season through the 2014-2015 season, although sample sizes increased dramatically after the 2009

150

pandemic (Table 1). Sampling changed slightly starting in 2004, when commercial labs were first

151

mandated to report positive tests to the state (31), but the vast majority of cases analyzed (9150/9451)

152

were observed from the 2004-2005 season onwards, after this change had been implemented.

153

Following CDC standards, ADHS defines the influenza season as epidemiological week 40

154

(around early October) through week 39 of the following year (32). The 2008-2009 and 2009-2010

155

influenza seasons spanned the first and second wave, respectively, of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We did

156

not analyze cases observed during this time period, because age distributions of cases and molecular

157

drivers of immune memory differed during the 2009 pandemic from the normal drivers of seasonal

158

influenza’s immuno-epidemiology of interest to this study (14,18,22). From the dataset of 9,510 seasonal

159

cases (defined as any case observed outside the 2008-2009 or 2009-2010 season), we excluded 58 cases

160

with birth years before 1918 (whose imprinting status could not be inferred unambiguously), and one case

161

whose year of birth was recorded in error. Ultimately, we analyzed 9,541 cases.

The Model

179
180
181

Reconstructed imprinting patterns
We reconstructed birth year-specific probabilities of childhood imprinting to H1N1, H2N2 or

182

H3N2 using methods described previously (11). These probabilities are based on patterns of first

183

childhood exposure to influenza A and reflect historical circulation (Fig. 1A). Most individuals born

184

between pandemics in 1918 and 1957 experienced a first influenza A virus (IAV) infection by H1N1, and

185

middle-aged cohorts born between pandemics in 1957 and 1968 almost all were first infected by H2N2

186

(note that because the first influenza exposure may occur after the first year of life, individuals born in the

187

years leading up to a pandemic have some probability of first infection by the new pandemic subtype,

188

Fig. 1A). Ever since its emergence in 1968, H3N2 has dominated seasonal circulation in humans, and

189

caused the majority of first infections in younger cohorts. However, H1N1 has also caused some seasonal

190

circulation since 1977, and has imprinted a fraction of all cohorts born since the mid-1970s (Fig. 1A).

191

Reconstructions assumed children age 0-12 in the year of case observation might not yet have

192

been exposed to any influenza virus. Interactions between imprinting and vaccination of naïve infants are

193

plausible, but poorly understood (11,33). We did not consider childhood vaccination effects here; only a

194

small percentage of individuals in the ADHS data were born at a time when healthy infants were routinely

195

vaccinated against influenza.

196
197
198
199

Expected age distributions under alternate imprinting models
If HA subtype-level imprinting protection shapes seasonal influenza risk, primary exposure to

200

HA subtype H1 or H3 in childhood should provide lifelong protection against modern variants of the

201

same HA subtype. If imprinting protection acts primarily against specific NA subtypes, lifelong

202

protection will be specific to N1 or to N2 (Fig. 1B). Alternatively, if broad HA group-level imprinting

203

shapes seasonal influenza risk, then cohorts imprinted to HA subtype H1 or H2 (both group 1) should be

204

protected against modern, seasonal H1N1 (also group 1), while only cohorts imprinted to H3 (group 2)

205

would be protected against modern, seasonal H3N2 (also group 2) (Fig. 1B). Collinearities between the

206

predictions of different imprinting models (Fig. 1D-I) were inevitable, given the limited diversity of

207

influenza antigenic subtypes circulating in humans over the past century (reflected in Fig. 1A). Note that

208

middle-aged cohorts, which were first infected by H2N2, are crucial, because they provide the only

209

leverage to differentiate between imprinting at the HA subtype, NA subtype or HA group-level level (Fig.

210

1B).

211

Our approach distinguishes between age-specific risk factors related to health and social

212

behavior, and birth year-specific effects related to imprinting. Specifically, age-specific risk could be

213

influenced by medical factors like age-specific vaccine coverage, age-specific risk of severe disease, age-

214

related changes in endocrinology and immunosenescence, or by behavioral factors like age-assorted

215

social mixing, and age-specific healthcare seeking behavior. These factors should have similar impacts on

216

any influenza subtype. In contrast, imprinting effects are subtype-specific. Thus, we fit a step function to

217

characterize the shape of age-specific risk of any confirmed influenza case. Simultaneously, we modeled

218

residual, subtype-specific differences in risk as a function of birth year, to focus on the possible role of

219

childhood imprinting. Each tested model used a linear combination of age-specific risk (Fig. 1C) and

220

birth year-specific risk (Fig. 1D-F) to generate an expected distribution of H1N1 or H3N2 cases (Fig.

221

1G-I). Note that for a given birth cohort, age-specific risk changed across progressive years of case

222

observation (as the cohort got older), whereas birth year-specific risk was constant over time.

223

To test quantitatively whether observed subtype-specific differences in incidence were most

224

consistent with imprinting at the HA subtype, NA subtype or HA group level, or with no contribution of

225

imprinting, we fitted a suite of models to each data set using a multinomial likelihood and then performed

226

model selection using AIC. AIC is used to compare the relative strength of statistical support for a set of

227

candidate models, each fitted to the same data, and favors parsimonious models that fit the data well

228

(34,35). Technical details are provided in the Methods.

230
231

Tested models
We fit a set of four models to the ADHS data set. The simplest model contained only age-specific

232

risk (abbreviated A), and more complex models added effects from imprinting at the HA subtype level

233

(S), at the HA group level (G), or at the NA subtype level (N): abbreviated AS, AG, and AN,

234

respectively. The age-specific risk curve took the form of a step function, in which relative risk was fixed

235

to 1 in age bin 0-4, and one free parameter was fit to represent relative risk in each of the following 12

236

age bins: {5-10, 11-17, 18-24, 25-31, 32-38, 39-45, 46-52, 53-59, 60-66, 67-73, 74-80, 81+}. Within

237

models that contained imprinting effects, the fraction of individuals in each single year of birth with

238

protective childhood imprinting was assumed proportional to reductions in risk. Two additional free

239

parameters quantified the relative risk of a confirmed H1N1 or H3N2 case, given imprinting protection

240

against that seasonal subtype.

241
242
243

Effect of influenza evolutionary rate on age profiles
We used publicly available data from Nextstrain (36,37), and from one previously published

244

study (38), to calculate annual antigenic advance, which we defined as the antigenic distance between

245

strains of a given lineage (pre-2009 H1N1, post-2009 H1N1 or H3N2) that circulated in consecutive

246

seasons (Methods). The “antigenic distance” between two influenza strains is used as a proxy for

247

similarity in antigenic phenotype, and potential for immune cross-protection. A variety of methods have

248

been developed to estimate antigenic distance using serological data, genetic data, or both (37–39).

249

To assess the impact of antigenic evolutionary rate on the epidemic age distribution, we tested

250

whether the proportion of cases in children increased in seasons associated with large antigenic changes.

251

If the rate of antigenic drift is a strong driver of age-specific influenza risk, then the fraction of influenza

252

cases observed in children should be negatively related to annual antigenic advance (30). In other words,

253

strains that have not changed much antigenically since the previous season should be unable to escape

254

pre-existing immunity in immunologically experienced adults, and more restricted to causing cases in

260

Subtype-specific differences in age distribution
Seasonal H3N2 epidemics consistently caused more clinically attended cases in older cohorts,

261

while H1N1 caused a greater proportion of cases in young and middle-aged adults (Figs. 2, S1-S2). These

262

patterns were apparent whether we compared H3N2 epidemic age distributions with those caused by the

263

pre-2009 seasonal H1N1 lineage, or with the post-2009 lineage. Observed patterns are consistent with the

264

predicted effects of cohort-specific imprinting (Fig. 1), and with previously reported differences in age

265

distribution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 incidence (12–14,29). See Fig. 2 for seasons where H1N1 and

266

H3N2 co-circulated in substantial numbers, and Figs. S1-S2 for the entire dataset and alternate smoothing

267

parameters.

Imprinting model selection

The data showed a strong preference for NA subtype-level imprinting over HA subtype-level

271

imprinting (DAIC=34.54), and effectively no statistical support for broad, HA group-level imprinting

272

(DAIC=249.06), or for an absence of imprinting effects (DAIC=385.42) (Fig. 3, Table 2). Visual

273

assessment of model fits (Fig. 3C-D) confirmed that models containing imprinting effects at the narrow,

274

NA or HA subtype levels provided the best fits to data. The lack of support for the no-imprinting model

275

suggests that imprinting from the first exposure shapes lifelong seasonal influenza risk, just as it does

276

avian-origin influenza (10, 12). However, imprinting appears to act more narrowly against seasonal

277

influenza than against avian influenza, providing cross protection only to a specific NA or HA subtype,

278

instead of broader, HA group-level protection. This result is consistent with the idea that

immunodominance of variable HA epitopes limits the breadth of immune cross protection deployed

against familiar, seasonal influenza subtypes (20,22).

As expected (see Fig. 1G-I), predictions from the two best models were highly collinear, except

282

in their risk predictions among middle-aged, H2N2-imprinted cohorts (birth years 1957-1968), and some

other minor differences arising from normalization across birth-years.

Fitted risk patterns
Fitted age-specific risk curves took similar forms in all tested models. After controlling for

301

demographic age distribution, estimated age-specific risk was highest in children and the elderly,

302

consistent with the buildup of immune memory across childhood, and waning immune function in the

303

aged (Fig. 3A shows the fitted curve from the best model). Estimates of imprinting parameters were less

304

than one, indicating some reduction in relative risk (Table 2). Within the best model, estimated reductions

305

in relative risk from childhood imprinting were stronger for H1N1 (0.34, 95% CI 0.29-0.42) than for

306

H3N2 (0.71, 95% CI 0.62-0.82). In the second-best model, AS (subtype-specific imprinting), estimated

307

reductions in H3N2 risk were particularly weak, and the confidence interval overlapped the null value of

308

1. Table 2 shows parameter estimates and 95% profile confidence intervals from all models fitted.

311

Effect of evolutionary rate

312

To test for effects of evolutionary rate on epidemic age distribution, we searched for decreases in

313

the proportion of cases among children in seasons associated with antigenic novelty, when highly drifted

314

strains might be more able to infect immunologically experienced adults. (We defined children as ages 0-

315

10, and verified internally that our analysis of evolutionary rate was insensitive to our exact choice of age

316

range for children). Consistent with this expectation, the data showed a slight negative but not significant

317

association between annual antigenic advance and the fraction of H3N2 cases observed in children (Fig.

318

4A). However, note that no clear relationship emerged between antigenic novelty and the fraction of cases

319

observed in any age group including older children (>10) and adults (Fig. 4A). These are the cohorts in

320

which epidemiological data show the clearest differences between H1N1 and H3N2’s age-specific

321

impacts (Fig. 2); if rate of antigenic evolution is a dominant driver of age-specific differences in

322

incidence, we would have expected to see clearer evidence of evolutionary rate effects within adults

323

cohorts, not just between adults and the youngest children. The data contained too few influenza seasons

324

with sufficient numbers of confirmed H1N1 cases to support meaningful Spearman correlation

325

coefficients for either pre-2009 or post-2009 seasonal H1N1 lineages.

326

Furthermore, if evolutionary rate is the dominant driver of subtype-specific differences in

327

epidemic age distribution, then when subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 show similar degrees of annual antigenic

328

advance, their age distributions of cases should appear more similar. However, the data showed that

329

differences in H1N1 and H3N2’s age-specific impacts did not converge when lineages showed similar

330

annual advance. When comparing the fraction of cases observed in specific age classes, H1N1 data

331

consistently clustered separately from H3N2, with H1N1 consistently causing fewer cases at the extremes

332

of age (children 0-10 and elderly adults 71-85), but more cases in middle-aged adults, regardless of

333

antigenic novelty (Fig. 4A). Smoothed density plots showed no clear relationship between annual

334

antigenic advance and age distribution (Fig. 4B). Overall, the data showed a weak, but not significant

335

signal that relatively severe, clinically attended cases may be more restricted to young children when

336

antigenic novelty is low, but the data did not show strong evidence that the magnitude of annual antigenic

337

drift is a systematic driver of epidemic age distribution across the entire population.

Discussion

341

We analyzed a large epidemiological surveillance dataset and found that seasonal influenza

342

subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 cause different age distributions of relatively severe, clinically attended cases,

343

confirming previously reported patterns (12–14). We analyzed several possible drivers of these

344

differences side-by-side, and found the greatest support for imprinting protection against seasonal

345

influenza viruses of the same NA or HA subtype as the first influenza strain encountered in childhood

346

(12,13). The data did not support strong effects from broader HA group-level imprinting, as recently

347

detected for novel zoonotic or pandemic viruses (9,11), or from differences in rates of antigenic evolution

348

(30). Our results suggest individuals retain a lifelong bias in immune memory, and that this imprint is not

349

erased even after decades of exposure to or vaccination against dissimilar influenza subtypes.

350

External evidence corroborates the idea that birth year, rather than age, drives subtype-specific

351

differences in seasonal influenza risk. When H3N2 first emerged in 1968, it caused little or no excess

352

mortality in the elderly, who had putatively been exposed, as children or young adults, to an H3 virus that

353

had circulated in the late 1800s (7,9). Meanwhile, H1N1-imprinted cohorts (those ~10-50 years old at the

354

time) experienced considerable excess mortality in the 1968 pandemic (7). Now, fifty years later, the

355

same H1N1-imprinted cohorts continue to experience excess H3N2 morbidity and mortality as older

356

adults (12–14,29) (Fig. 2).

357

In model comparison, the data supported childhood imprinting to NA. Although NA is not as

358

intensively studied as HA, these results emphasize the increasingly recognized importance of both

359

antigens as drivers of protection against seasonal influenza (15–17). Realistically, some combination of

360

effects from both HA and NA subtype-level imprinting probably shapes seasonal influenza risk; both

361

models of imprinting produced similar fits to data, and far outperformed other models in terms of AIC

362

(Fig. 3). Unfortunately, due to the limited diversity of seasonal influenza strains that have circulated in

363

humans over the past century, collinearities between even the relatively simple models tested here

364

prevented us from testing more complicated models of combined effects from imprinting to multiple

365

antigens. Deeper insights into the respective roles of HA and NA will most likely need to come from

366

focused immunological cohort studies, in which individual histories of influenza infection are recorded

367

and can be studied alongside changes in serology, PBMCs, and/or the B cell repertoire (33).

368

Alternatively, the development of immunological biomarkers for diagnosis of imprinting status in

369

individual patients could substantially increase the power of epidemiological inference.

370

We did not detect a clear relationship between annual antigenic advance and epidemic age

371

distribution, although small sample sizes may have limited our statistical power. We did detect a weak

372

trend, consistent with the idea that influenza cases are more restricted to immunologically inexperienced

373

children in seasons of low antigenic advance, as previously proposed (30). But the data did not reveal a

374

clear relationship between antigenic advance and the fraction of cases occurring in adult age groups,

375

where epidemiological data reveal distinct subtype-specific differences in impact. Perhaps antigenic

376

advance shapes how cases are distributed between children and adults, but has small or inconsistent

377

impacts within the adult population. We speculate that clearer relationships between antigenic advance

378

and epidemic age distribution might emerge if methods to estimate antigenic distance were able to

379

incorporate effects such as immune history (40), glycosylation (40,41), and immunity to antigens other

380

than HA (16,17,42).

381

The exact immunological drivers of imprinting protection against seasonal influenza remain

382

unclear, but these results provide some new clues. Traditionally, within-subtype cross-protection is

383

thought to decay quickly with antigenic drift. Strains that circulated more than 14 years apart rarely show

384

measurable cross-protective titers by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (38). The short timescale

385

of immune memory to variable HA head epitopes stands in contrast to patterns observed in our study and

386

others (12–14), where within-subtype immune memory imprinted in childhood appears to persist for an

387

entire human lifetime, remaining evident even in the oldest cohorts. We speculate that within-subtype

388

imprinting protection may involve epitopes that are more conserved, and stable over time, than those

389

typically measured in HI assays (which inform most existing estimates of antigenic distance, but may

390

disproportionately measure antibodies to variable, immunodominant epitopes on the HA head (21,22)).

391

Across a lifetime of exposures to diverse H1N1 and H3N2 variants, repeated back-boosting of antibodies

392

to intermediately conserved sites on HA or NA (i.e. sites conserved within but not across HA and NA

393

subtypes), could explain the longevity of subtype-level imprinting protection. This is consistent with

394

recent evidence that the immune repertoire shifts to focus on more conserved influenza epitopes as we age

395

(25,26).

396

Another possibility is that, memory B cell clones developed during the first childhood influenza

397

exposure may later adapt via somatic hypermutation to “follow” antigenic targets as they drift over time

398

(25,28). However, this would be inconsistent with new evidence suggesting memory B cells are relatively

399

fixed in phenotype, and have little potential for ongoing affinity maturation (43,44). Thus, the first

400

influenza exposure in life may fill a child's memory B cell repertoire with clones that serve in the future

401

as prototypes that can be rapidly and effectively tailored to recognize drifted influenza strains of the same

402

subtype. Finally, the role of CD4+ T cells in imprinting is unclear, but T cell memory and T cell help to B

403

cells within germinal centers both play at least some role in the development of the immune repertoire

404

(45).

405

Signals of imprinting protection are anomalously strong in the current cohort of elderly adults, as

406

reflected by higher estimates of imprinting protection to H1N1 than H3N2. The oldest subjects in our

407

data, born slightly after 1918, and would not have encountered an influenza virus of any subtype other

408

than H1N1 until roughly age 30. Repeated early-life exposures to diverse H1N1 variants may have

409

reinforced and expanded the breadth of H1N1-specific immune memory (5,46). But this strong H1N1

410

protection seems to come at a cost; even after decades of seasonal H3N2 exposure, and vaccination, older

411

cohorts have evidently failed to develop equally strong protection against H3N2. HA group 1 antigens

412

(e.g. H1) appear to induce narrower immune responses, and less cross-group protection than structurally

413

distinct HA group 2 antigens (e.g. H3) (23). Perhaps elderly cohorts imprinted to group 1 antigens have

414

been trapped in narrower responses that offer exceptional protection against strains similar to that of first

415

exposure but relatively poor adaptability to other subtypes.

416

We speculate that imprinting protection, which currently limits the number of severe, clinically-

417

attended H1N1 cases in the elderly, also limits the mortality impact of H1N1 viruses. Although pre- and

418

post- 2009 H1N1 lineages have caused slightly different profiles of age-specific mortality (13), neither

419

H1N1 lineage causes nearly as many deaths as H3N2 in high-risk elderly cohorts (13,29,47). On the one

420

hand, if strong subtype-specific biases from imprinting remain in future cohorts of elderly adults, our

421

results would corroborate the idea that mortality from H1N1 may increase as protection in the elderly

422

shifts from H1N1 toward other subtypes (9,13). On the other hand, given that cohorts born after 1968

423

have had much more varied early life exposures to both H1N1 and H3N2, these cohorts may show a

424

greater ability to act as immunological generalists as they become elderly, capable of effective defense

425

against multiple subtypes.

426

Our study has several limitations. Relatively severe, clinically attended cases are much more

427

likely to be detected, confirmed to subtype, and included in our data than mild cases. Thus, while our

428

results show a clear relationship between subtype-level imprinting and risk of relatively severe, clinically

429

attended influenza, the relationship between imprinting and mild or asymptomatic cases could not be

430

determined from available data.

431

Given the limited number of variables recorded in the data, we could not model explicitly the

432

impact of individual risk factors such as the presence of comorbidities, patient sex, or vaccination status.

433

All these factors are known to shape immunity and influenza risk (48), and all may cause individual

434

imprinting outcomes to vary from the average, population trends measured by our study. Understanding

435

how these patient-level covariates modulate imprinting and other aspects of immunity is the next frontier

436

in this line of research. For now, working within the constraints of the available data, we designed the

437

age-specific risk component of the model to capture empirically the combined effects of several risk

438

factors that could not be modeled individually. Additionally, we analyzed the relative count of H1N1 to

439

H3N2 cases within each single year of birth, not absolute incidence, to control for minor age-specific

440

biases in sampling, which are almost inevitably present in any large data set.

441

Another limitation was the low number of confirmed cases available in the pre-2009 era. Large,

442

detailed data sets collected continuously over decades provide the greatest power to separate the effects of

443

age from birth year. We emphatically echo earlier calls (49) for more systematic sharing of single year-of-

444

age influenza surveillance data, standardization of sampling effort, and reporting of age-specific

445

denominators, which could substantially boost the scientific community’s ability to link influenza's

446

genetic and antigenic properties with epidemiological outcomes. Additionally, collection and reporting of

447

covariates such as sex, vaccination status and the presence of comorbidities in surveillance data would

448

help us understand how patient-level variables modulate imprinting, and immunity in general (50,51).

449

Altogether, this analysis confirms that the epidemiological burden of H1N1 and H3N2 is shaped

450

by cohort-specific differences in childhood imprinting (9,12,13,52), and that this imprinting acts at the

451

HA or NA subtype level against seasonal influenza. The lack of support for broader, HA group-level

452

imprinting effects emphasizes the consequences of immunodominance of influenza’s most variable

453

epitopes, and the difficulty of deploying broadly protective memory B cell responses against familiar,

454

seasonal strains. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of how antigenic seniority shapes

455

cohort-specific risk during epidemics. The fact that elderly cohorts show relatively weak immune

456

protection against H3N2, even after living through decades of seasonal exposure to or vaccination against

457

H3N2, suggests that antibody responses acquired in adulthood do not provide the same strength or

458

durability of immune protection as responses primed in childhood. Immunological experiments that

459

consider multiple viral exposures, and cohort studies in which individual histories of influenza infection

460

are tracked from birth, promise to illuminate how B cell and T cell memory develop across a series of

461

early life exposures. In particular, these studies may provide clearer insights than epidemiological data

462

into which influenza antigens, epitopes and immune effectors play the greatest role in immune imprinting,

463

and how quickly subtype-specific biases become entrenched across the first or the first few exposures.

Materials and Methods

466
467

Estimation of age from birth year in ADHS data

468

The data contained three variables, influenza season, birth year and confirmed subtype. For most

469

cases, birth year was extracted directly from the reported date of birth in patient medical records, but age

470

was not known. We estimated patient age at the time case observation using the formula [year of

471

observation]-[birth year]. To ensure that the minimum estimated age was 0, the second year in the

472

influenza season of case observation was considered the calendar year of observation (e.g. 2013 for the

473

2012-2013 season).

474
475
476

Splines
In Figure 2, smoothing splines were fit to aid visual interpretation of noisy data. We fit splines

477

using the command smooth.spline(x = AGE, y = FRACTIONS, spar = 0.8) in R version 3.5.0. Variables

478

AGE and FRACTIONS were vectors whose entries represented single years of age, and the fraction of

479

cases observed in the corresponding age group. The smoothing parameter 0.8 was chosen to provide a

480

visually smooth fit. Alternative smoothing parameter choices (0.6 & 1.0) are shown in Figs. S1-S2.

481

Although the choice of smoothing parameter changed the shape of each fitted spline, qualitative

482

differences between splines fitted to H1N1 or H3N2 were insensitive.

483
484
485

Model formulation
For each unique season in which cases were observed, define p as a vector whose entries

486

represent the expected probability that a randomly drawn H1N1 or a randomly drawn H3N2 case was

487

observed in an individual born in year b. Each model defined, p as a linear combination of age-specific

488

risk, birth year-specific risk (i.e. imprinting effects). All tested models were nested within the equation:

491
492

To include risk factors that only modulated risk from one subtype, we included indicator

H3N2 cases, respectively, and 0 otherwise.

Demographic age distribution (D)
The population of Arizona aged slightly across the study period, so we controlled for shifting

of total population (both sexes) for the state of Arizona, based on the 2000 and 2010 census (53). The US

501

Census Bureau reports population estimates for ages 0-84, but only provides an aggregate estimate for

502

ages 85+. We impute the number of individuals in each single year of age over 85 using a linear model fit

503

to data on age 75-84, with a minimum threshold of 1000 individuals per single year of age. State-specific

504

population estimates were not available prior to the 2000 census, so we substituted estimates from the

505

year 2000 for cases observed in the 1993-94, and the 1994-95 seasons. Vector D represented the fraction

506

of the total population at the time of case observation that fell in a given birth year.

508

Age-specific risk (A)

509

Age-specific risk was defined as a step function, in which relative risk was fixed to value 1 in an

510

arbitrarily chosen age bin, and then z-1 free parameters, denoted r2 to rz, were fit to describe relative risk

511

in all other age bins. Below, 1i are indicator functions specifying whether each vector entry is a member

512

of age bin i.

equation 1) summed to 1. Thus, vector DA can be interpreted as the expected distribution of cases of any

518

influenza case (either subtype), in the absence of birth year-specific biases from imprinting.

Imprinting (I)
An indicator function defined whether a given prediction vector described risk of confirmed

522

H1N1 or H3N2. Let fIHxNy be vectors describing the fraction of cases of each birth year that were protected

523

against strain HxNy by their childhood imprinting. We defined rIHxNy as free parameters describing the risk

524

of confirmed HxNy, given imprinting protection. Finally, the factor describing the effect of imprinting (I)

525

was defined as:

Likelihood
We used equations 1-3 to generate predicted case age distributions (p) for each influenza season

532

(s) in which cases were observed in the data. Then, the likelihood was obtained as a product of

533

multinomial densities across all seasons. If ns represents the total number of cases observed in a given

534

season, x0cs,…xmcs each represent the number of cases observed in each single year of birth, and if

535

p0cs…pmcs each represent entries in the model’s predicted birth year-distribution of cases, then the

likelihood is given by:

542
543

Model fitting and model comparison
We fit models containing all possible combinations of the above factors to influenza data from

544

each season in the data. We simultaneously estimated all free parameter values using the optim() function

545

in R, with method L-BFGS-B. Imprinting parameters could take values in [0,1], representing the

546

possibility of a reduction in risk. Age-specific risk parameters could take any value greater than 0. We

547

calculated likelihood profiles and 95% profile confidence intervals for each free parameter. Confidence

548

intervals were defined using the method of likelihood ratios (34).

549
550
551

Antigenic advance
We obtained antigenic distance estimates from Nextstrain (nextstrain.org) (36,54), and from

552

source data from Figure 3 in Bedford et al. (38). Nextstrain calculates antigenic distance using genetic

553

data from GISAID (55), and using methods described by Neher et al. (37). We analyzed “CTiter”

554

estimates from Nextstrain, which correspond to Neher et al.’s “tree model” method, and are most directly

555

comparable to pre-2009 H1N1 estimates from (38). We repeated analyses using estimates from the

556

similar “substitution model” method and verified that our choice of antigenic distance metric did not

557

meaningfully impact our results. The negative Spearman correlation between antigenic advance and

558

proportion of cases in children was lower, but still non-significant when using the substitution model

559

(p=0.06); all other differences were unremarkable. Datasets from Nextstrain and Bedford et al. both

560

contained redundant antigenic distance estimates for the H3N2 lineage, but only Bedford et al. analyzed

561

the pre-2009 H1N1 lineage, and only Nextstrain data analyzed the post-2009 H1N1 lineage. The antigenic

562

distance estimates reported by Bedford et al. were roughly proportional to those reported on Nextstrain,

563

but greater in absolute magnitude (37). To enable visualization of all three lineages on the same plot axes,

564

we rescaled pre-2009 H1N1 estimates from Bedford et al. using the formula dNextstrain = 0.47dBedford. The

565

scaling factor was chosen so that directly-comparable H3N2 distance estimates obtained using each

566

method spanned the same range (Fig. S3). The Nextstrain data files used in this analysis are archived

567

within our analysis code.

Figure 1. Model and expectations under different imprinting hypotheses. (A) Reconstructed, birth
year-specific probabilities of imprinting (representative example specific to cases observed in 2015).
Throughout the manuscript, group 1 HA subtypes are represented in blue and group 2 subtypes in red. (B)
Expected imprinting protection against H1N1 or H3N2 under the three tested models. (C) Cartoon of
expected age distribution of any influenza case, before controlling for subtype-specific imprinting. The
shape of this curve is purely hypothetical, but each of our tested models combined demographic age
distribution with a fitted, age-specific risk step function to generate similar, data-driven curves. (D-F)
Fraction of each birth year unprotected by their childhood imprinting (from A) determines the shape of
birth year-specific risk. (G-I) A linear combination of age-specific risk (C), and birth year-specific risk
(D-F) give the expected age distribution of H1N1 or H3N2 cases under each model.

Table 1. Confirmed cases in surveillance data from Arizona Department of Health Services. Data
representing the first and second waves of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons)
were excluded.

Figure 2. Observed age distributions, Arizona. Points show fraction of confirmed H1N1 or H3N2 cases
observed in each single year of age. Lines show a smoothing spline fit to observed distributions. (A) All
confirmed cases in the data (aggregate across all seasons). (B-G) Age distributions from individual
seasons in which both H1N1 and H3N2 circulated (seasons with ≥ 50 confirmed cases of each subtype are
shown here. See Fig. S1 for all seasons).
Figure 3. Model fits and model selection. (A) Fitted effects of age, after normalization to demographic
age distribution and (B) imprinting effects from model AN, which provided the best fit to data. (C-D)
Model fits to observed age distributions of H1N1 (C) and H3N2 (D) cases. Model name abbreviations
indicate which factors were included: A = age-specific risk, N = NA subtype-level imprinting, S = HA
subtype-level imprinting, G = HA group-level imprinting. All models included demographic age
distribution.
Figure 4. Effect of antigenic advance on age distribution. (A) Relationship between annual antigenic
advance and the fraction of cases observed in children (0-10), or in adult age groups. Each data point
represents a single influenza season in which at least 100 confirmed cases of a given subtype were
observed. Blue label shows Spearman correlation between the fraction of H3N2 cases observed in each
age group and annual antigenic advance. Blue dashes show linear trend fitted using lm() in R. (B) Seasonspecific age distributions of casses, colored by antigenic advance since the previous season.
