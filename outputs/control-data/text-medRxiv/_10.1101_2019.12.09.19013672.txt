Abstract
Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of genomic alterations may impact prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD). We investigated ITH of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), DNA methylation, and
point mutations in lung cancer driver genes in 292 tumor samples from 84 LUAD patients. We found
substantial SCNA and methylation ITH, and clonal architecture analyses showed congruent evolutionary
trajectories for SCNAs and DNA methylation aberrations. Interestingly, methylation ITH mapping to
gene promoter areas or tumor suppressor genes was low. Moreover, ITH composed of genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms altering the same cancer driver genes was found in several tumors. To quantify
ITH for valid statistical association analyses we developed an average pairwise ITH index (APITH),
which does not depend on the number of samples per tumor. APITH indexes for SCNAs and methylation
aberrations were both significantly associated with poor prognosis. This study further establishes the
important clinical implications of genetic and epigenetic ITH in LUAD.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, causing more than one million deaths worldwide
annually 1. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histologic subtype and accounts for about
40% of lung cancer incidence. While hundreds of LUAD tumors have been profiled extensively based on
a single biopsy per patient 2,3, fewer subjects have been investigated for diversity within the tumor
through multi-sampling. A few studies have analyzed the extent of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of
somatic nucleotide variants (SNVs) and/or somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) 4-6 , and others of
DNA methylation 7,8 in LUAD. Some of these studies found a positive association between SNV ITH
and risk of relapse 4 or SCNA ITH and cancer free survival (combining risk of mortality and of
recurrences) 6. However, ITH in these studies was estimated without adjusting for the number of samples
examined for each tumor and the methylation analysis did not take into account sample purity.
Using multiple samples per tumor it is possible to reconstruct the cancer evolutionary history. In prostate
and brain tumors, congruent evolutionary trajectories of genetic and epigenetic mechanism have been
reported 9,10, but to what extent epigenetic changes occur alongside phylogenetic changes in LUAD
remains largely unknown.
Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of ITH of somatic mutations in cancer driver genes, copy
number aberrations and DNA methylation in 292 tumor samples from 84 LUAD patients. We also
investigated genetic/epigenetic ITH affecting cancer driver pathways. Moreover, we ordered genetic and
epigenetic events along the LUAD evolutionary trajectories, and tested the hypothesis that co-occurrence
of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms characterizes the evolution of lung adenocarcinomas. Finally, we
assessed the clonality of targetable cancer driver genes and evaluated the association of ITH with clinical
outcomes (survival and, separately, risk of metastasis) correcting for sample purity and using a novel
unbiased statistical model which takes into account the number of samples examined from each tumor.

Patient Characteristics
To determine clonal evolutionary patterns in the genome and epigenome, we performed multi-region
sampling from 84 LUAD patients, of whom 76 (90%) reported past or current smoking. All the samples
were treatment-naïve and surgically excised. The demographic characteristics are summarized in Table 1
and Supplementary Table 1. The clinical outcome analyses were based on a median follow up time of
40.0 months. In total, 292 tumor tissue samples and 157 non-tumor samples (including 74 normal tissue
samples, 81 blood samples and 2 buccal cell sample) were collected from 84 subjects. ITH was estimated
for tumors that included between 2 and 11 tumor samples for each assay type. For reference, we used
blood or buccal cells for deep target sequencing and, to factor out high tissue specificity, normal tissue
samples for methylation. For SNP arrays we used only tumor samples. Samples used for each assay type
are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1.
Clonal architecture of somatic mutations and somatic copy number aberrations
Across all patients, deep target sequencing revealed SNVs in 35 out of the 37 cancer driver genes assayed
(Supplementary Table 2). On average, 3.4 genes had nonsynonymous SNVs in each patient. The five
most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (50%), KRAS (46.4%), KMT2C (39.3%), STK11 (28.6%) and
KEAP1 (25%), consistent with previous studies for LUAD 2,11,12 (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). For
each patient, SNVs were classified as public if all tumor samples from the same tumor carried the SNVs
and private otherwise. 65.3% (126 of 193) of SNVs were public, a higher proportion than what was
observed in the TRACERx study6 (public SNVs = 50.5%), if we apply the same definition of public vs.
private events. In total, 24.3% (47/193; 30 public, 17 private) of SNVs were predicted to strongly alter
protein functions (e.g., frameshift or gain of stop codon mutations). The public SNVs showed slightly
higher dN/dS ratio than the private SNVs (public SNVs: 3.40 (95% CI: 1.80-6.44), private SNVs: 2.55
(95% CI: 1.29-5.05)). Overall, the functional impact and selective pressure showed no significant
difference between public and private SNVs.

Next, we performed unsupervised clustering based on the global SCNA profiles (see Methods).
Intratumoral heterogeneity was lower than intertumoral heterogeneity, with 226/268 (84.3%) samples
from the same tumors clustered together and another 7/268 (2.6%) samples from the same tumors in close
proximity to each other (Supplementary Fig. 2).
In order to quantify levels of intratumoral heterogeneity, we developed a novel metric, the average
pairwise ITH index (APITH, see Methods) and applied it to the SCNA profiles of all patients (Fig. 3A). A
major advantage of APITH is that its value is not biased by the number of multi-region samples per tumor
while a previously used method 6 is strongly affected (Fig. 3B). APITH ranged from 0 to 0.68 with a
mean=0.184, median=0.157 and standard deviation=0.153 (Fig. 3C), suggesting ~18.4% of the genome
had different copy number status on average for any pair of tumor samples from the same patient. Of
note, the largest APITH values (>0.5) were from patients with only two tumor samples, likely because of
large variance in the APITH estimate.
Previous TCGA studies 2,13 have reported recurrent SCNA regions for LUAD and identified in these
regions 32 candidate driver genes, including 25 amplified and 7 deleted genes. In our samples, SCNA
ITH in the recurrently altered regions was similar to SCNA ITH across the whole genome
(Supplementary Fig. 3). SCNAs of candidate driver genes were observed in 11.3-72.5% tumors,
comparable to the TCGA study (Supplementary Table 3). SMARCA4 deletion and MCL1 amplification
were the most frequent SCNA events (72.5% and 68.75% respectively). KRAS and EGFR amplification
were also observed in 38.75% and 41.25% of tumors, respectively, of which 41.9% and 33.3% were
public.
We do not report APITH of SNVs since we conducted target sequencing of 37 cancer driver genes only,
with resulting low number of mutations identified.
Intratumoral heterogeneity of DNA methylation

We first performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on methylation profiles using the 5000
most variable CpG sites across the genome (Fig. 4A) and, separately, limited our analysis to CpGs in
promoter regions (Supplementary Fig. 4). Both analyses confirmed that normal tissue samples from
almost all subjects (59/61) clustered together. Similarly, 183/205 (89.3%) samples from the same tumors
clustered together, showing higher intertumoral heterogeneity than intratumoral heterogeneity.
Previous studies have identified high levels of methylation in promoter regions of some genes, also
referred to as the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in multiple cancer types, including lung
cancer 2,14,15. 16/68 (23.5%) patients had significantly altered CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP-H)
and 47/68 (69.1%) had a normal-like pattern (CIMP-L). In five patients, both CIMP-H and CIMP-L
patterns were observed in the same tumor.
We next examined the distribution of DNA methylation ITH based on either the probes across the whole
genome or those mapping to specific genomic regions (Fig. 4B). The CpG probes mapping to CpG island
regions had a significantly lower APITH compared to those mapping to other regions (P = 1.09x10-10), as
previously observed in aggressive prostate cancer 10. Moreover, the CpG probes mapping to gene
promoter regions (TSS1500, TSS200, 5’ UTR and 1st exon) had lower APITH compared to those mapping
to gene bodies, 3’ UTR regions and intergenic regions (P =1.626x10-8).
Restricting the analysis to CpG probes mapping to 250 oncogenes and 300 tumor suppressor genes
predicted by TUSON Explorer 16 revealed that methylation ITH mapping to tumor suppressor genes was
significantly lower than that of oncogenes (p=1.68x10-17) and that of other genes (1.50x10-16 ) (Fig. 4C).
Inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes by hypermethylation at promoter regions has been observed in
multiple cancer types including lung cancer17-19. Lower DNA methylation ITH in these regions suggests
greater selective pressure which is consistent with their high putative impacts in oncogenic
transformation.
Intratumoral heterogeneity of genomic alteration types in cancer driver pathways

We analyzed genetic and epigenetic aberrations of 13 cancer driver genes in the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway
that are frequently mutated in LUAD2 (Fig. 5). For SCNAs, we only included amplification of oncogenes
and deletion of tumor suppressor genes. For DNA methylation, we determined abnormality based on
probes located in CpG islands at promoter regions of the target genes.
Across the 13 genes, 77/84 (91.7%) tumors harbored genetic or epigenetic alterations in this pathway;
ITH was observed in 69 (89.6%) tumors. SNVs, SCNAs and methylation of the driver genes altered
7.28%, 17.5%, and 4.19% of the tumors, respectively. Different types of genetic or epigenetic alterations
affected different samples in the same tumor. For example, in tumor IGC 11-1130, four samples were
tested and all had alterations in the KRAS pathway. Among them, two samples had amplification in ROS1
and the other two samples had aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter regions of ALK (Fig.5).
In the cell cycle pathway, genetic or epigenetic changes in RB1, CDKN2A or SWI/SNF components were
observed in 57/84 (67.9%) tumors, with ITH in 33 (57.9%) tumors.
Evolutionary trajectories inferred from genetic and epigenetic aberrations
To reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories, we inferred clonal relationships for tumors that were assayed
for both SCNA and DNA methylation in multiple regions. For each pair of tumor samples per tumor, we
first calculated the Euclidean distance separately for SCNA profiles and the DNA methylation levels of
the 5000 most variable CpG probes. We found that the pairwise SCNA distances were positively
correlated with DNA methylation distances (Fig. 6A, Spearman's correlation coefficient’s = 0.586,
p<1x10-16). To exclude the possibility that the DNA methylation changed purely as a consequence of the
changed ratio between alleles, we carried out a sensitivity analysis by testing the correlation between
SCNA and methylation distances only in regions with homogeneous copy number status and observed
consistent results (Supplementary Fig. 5, Spearman's correlation coefficient’s = 0.638, p<1x10-16).
Consequently, the topology of evolutionary trees inferred from SCNAs and DNA methylation exhibited
similarity (Fig. 6B for 6 tumors with at least 5 samples each, and Supplementary Fig. 6 for 8 tumors with

at least 4 samples each). These results support the co-occurrence of the two mechanisms in shaping the
cancer genome.
Of note, when we overlaid the SNVs in target genes on the SCNA- and methylation-derived trees, we
observed that some genes were altered by different mechanisms in the same trees. For example, tumor
IGC-10-1179 had STK11 mutated in the trunk and deleted in a branch (Fig. 6C).
Associations between intratumoral heterogeneity and clinical outcomes
We tested the association of SCNA and DNA methylation APITH with clinical data and observed no
significant correlations with age, sex, tumor stage or grade (Supplementary Table 4). Smokers had higher
APITH of SCNAs (P=0.035, nominally significant) but similar APITH of methylation compared with
non-smokers. Other smoking behaviors (e.g., smoking intensity and duration) were not associated with
APITH of SCNA or DNA methylation.
Next, we examined the associations between APITH and survival or risk of distant metastasis. For each
analysis, we performed a Cox proportional-hazards model weighted or unweighted by the variance of the
estimated APITH. For significant associations, we found that weighted analysis had smaller p-values than
unweighted analysis, as expected. Thus, we report below results based on weighted analyses (summary of
weighted and unweighted results is in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).
Similar to the TRACERx study 6, we found that increased SCNA APITH was associated with poor overall
survival with p=0.05 using all patients and p=0.0044 (HR=1.77, 95% CI=1.2-2.6) when restricting the
analysis to patients with ≥3 tumor samples per tumor (Supplementary Table 5 and Fig. 7a). SCNA APITH
was not significantly associated with risk of developing distant metastases (Supplementary Table 5). Of
note, for both overall survival and distant metastasis, APITH based on SCNAs in the 37 cancer driver
genes provided lower prognostic value than the APITH of SCNAs in the whole genome.
We then tested the association of DNA methylation-based APITH with overall survival and the risk of
distant metastases. We found that APITH based on the 5000 most variable CpG probes was associated

with overall survival (HR= 1.27, 95% CI=1.05-1.55, p=0.016, Supplementary Table 6 and Fig. 7B) but
not significantly associated with risk of metastasis (p=0.14). APITH based on CpG probes mapping to
island regions had the strongest association with overall survival (HR=1.31, 95% CI=1.10-1.57,
p=0.0028, Fig. 7C) and were also found to be associated with risk of distant metastasis (HR=1.35,
95%CI=1.07-1.72, p=0.012, Fig. 7D). The results for APITH defined based on other genomic regions are
in Supplementary Table 6. The CIMP phenotype did not show substantial ITH, i.e., there were only a few
tumors with CIMP-H and CIMP-L across samples from the same tumor. Therefore, we could not analyze
the association of APITH of CIMP with clinical outcomes.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated genetic and epigenetic intra-tumor heterogeneity based on multi-region
sampling per tumor across 84 lung adenocarcinoma patients. On average, 35% of SNVs in targeted genes
were private and ~18.4% of the genome had SCNA ITH for any pair of samples from the same tumor.
Methylation in CpG islands or gene promoter regions, particularly of tumor suppressor genes, had low
ITH. Different types of somatic alterations across samples from the same tumors affected cancer driver
genes in the RTK/RAS/RAF or cell cycle pathways. SCNAs and DNA methylation changes showed
congruent evolutionary trajectories. Notably, we developed a statistical approach to correctly estimate
ITH for any pair of tumor samples from the same patient and showed that ITH of SCNAs and DNA
methylation was associated with poor prognosis.
The findings of substantial ITH across different genomic types and of similar tumor evolutionary
trajectories for genetic and epigenetic changes are important to understand the biology and natural history
of LUAD. Moreover, they are crucial to inform clinical management and therapeutic strategies. Using
multi-region sampling, we identified private events in cancer driver genes, which may not be detected by
a single biopsy or by limiting the analyses to point mutations. For example, combining genetic and
epigenetic changes, 95.2% of tumors had activating events in the RTK pathway, of which ~36% were
private.

ITH of SCNA and ITH of DNA methylation (overall and in CpG islands) were similarly associated with
shorter survival in our study, and ITH of methylation in CpG islands was also associated with higher risk
of developing metastasis. Adding both measures in the same model did not significantly improve the
prediction value (data not shown), likely because the two measures were highly correlated to each other.
In previous studies, ITH of SCNAs was quantified as the fraction of SCNAs not shared by all samples in
the tumor 6. Clearly, this ITH index positively depends on the number of tumor samples per tumor (Fig.
3B) and thus hinders valid cross-patient comparisons or testing associations with clinical outcomes.
Moreover, unobserved factors that are associated with the number of tumor samples per patient, e.g.,
tumor size or different study sites, may confound the association analysis with clinical outcomes. We
propose APITH as an index for ITH, similar in spirit to that previously proposed for quantifying ITH from
the observation of SNVs 20. This index, defined by pairwise distances of genomic profiles, is not biased
by the number of samples per tumor and thus allows association testing for any genomic profiling
platforms. Crucially, the variance of APITH estimates depend on the number of samples per tumor and
thus a naïve statistical association test between APITH and any outcome may have low statistical power.
We explicitly addressed this issue by quantifying the variance of APITH and proposing a procedure for its
numerical calculation. This variance was used to weight subjects in the regression analyses to achieve the
best statistical power, as demonstrated in theoretical analyses (Supplementary Methods). As a
confirmation, our empirical results showed that the weighted analyses produced more significant results
than the unweighted analyses for the association between APITH and overall survival.
A comparison between the previous TRACERx study6 and this study using APITH to estimate the ITH of
SCNAs is reported in the Supplementary Notes.
In conclusion, our results delineate the genetic and epigenetic ITH in LUAD and provide a rigorous
statistical approach to estimate ITH for comparisons across individuals and for associations with clinical
outcomes. DNA methylation and genomic changes followed similar evolutionary trajectories and strongly

impacted cancer driver genes and pathways in a complex manner. These findings can inform the clinical
management of lung adenocarcinomas suggesting that taking multiple biopsies and analyzing multiple
genomic types may be needed to capture the landscape of targetable events. Future larger studies are
warranted to identify the combination of genomic types and genomic regions to best predict clinical
outcomes.

Methods
Patients and multi-region tumor samples
The current work includes 84 LUAD patients from the EAGLE study, a population-based case-control
study conducted in Italy between 2002 and 2005 12,21,22. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
within 20 min of surgical resection and the precise site of tissue sampling was recorded. All tumor
samples were histologically confirmed as primary lung adenocarcinoma (not mixed types or
undifferentiated cases) with at least 50% tumor nuclei and less than 20% necrosis. Normal tissue samples
were taken at >3 cm from the tumor tissue and had to have no tumor nuclei at histological examination.
Based on these characteristics and DNA quality, we were able to analyze between 2 and 11 samples from
each tumor, for an overall 292 tumor samples and 157 non-tumor samples (including 74 normal tissue
samples, 81 blood samples and 2 buccal cell samples). Detailed information on tumor characteristics,
recurrence, treatment, and follow-up data were recovered from patients’ medical records and follow-up
visits and hospital admissions were identified by linkage with the region-wide Regional Health Authority
database (Supplementary Table 1). Recurrence history was ascertained through December 31, 2010. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the US National Cancer Institute and
the involved institutions in Italy. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects prior to study
participation.

Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) in tumors were profiled using 705,667 probes from the Illumina
HumanOmniExpress SNP arrays in 268 tumor samples from 80 subjects. SCNA segmentation was performed
using ASCAT 23 based only on B allele frequencies to avoid hypersegmentation; copy number status of
each segment was determined based on log R ratio. Bisulphite treatment and Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assays were performed to derive the DNA methylation levels in 205
tumor samples and 74 normal tissue samples from 68 subjects; in the absence of paired normal tissue
samples for 7 tumors, methylation levels were imputed based on the methylation levels of the overall
normal samples. For DNA methylation, we analyzed 338,730 CpG probes after excluding probes
annotated with genetic variants, in repetitive genomic regions or on the X-chromosome. Deep target
sequencing was performed to identify SNVs for 37 established lung cancer driver genes 2,11,12 with an
average sequencing depth of 500X in 180 tumor samples and 55 blood samples and 1 buccal sample from
56 subjects. Sequence data were processed using the standard Ion Torrent Suite Software (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) version 5.0.7 and somatic mutations were detected using TVC (Torrent variant caller) version
5.0.9. More details can be found in Supplementary Methods. Samples used for each assay are listed in
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1.
Bioinformatic analyses
DNA methylation: Bisulphite treatment and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assays
were performed to derive the DNA methylation levels. Raw methylated and unmethylated intensities were
background-corrected, and dye-bias-equalized, to correct for technical variation in signal between arrays.
For background correction, we applied a normal-exponential convolution, using the intensity of the
Infinium I probes in the channel opposite their design to measure non-specific signal. For each CpG
probe, the DNA methylation level was summarized as the fraction of signal intensity obtained from the
methylated beads over the total signal intensity. After excluding CpG probes annotated with genetic
variants, in repetitive genomic regions or on the X-chromosome, 338,730 CpG probes remained for
analysis. Each CpG probe was annotated as in CpG Island (denoted as CGI), nonCGI (including shores

and shelves) or “open-sea”. Each CpG probe was also annotated as in promoter (TSS200, TSS1500 and
first exon), body, 3’UTR in a specific gene or annotated as intergenic. Methylation ITH of specific
genomic regions was computed using the average pair-wise distance of the top 10% variably expressed
probes mapping to that region scaled by the number of probes. To identify potential driver DNA
methylation events, we analyzed CpG island regions of cancer driver genes and compared the beta values
of tumor samples and corresponding normal samples. We used 0.3 as the cutoff value to call differences
in beta values7.
Deep target sequencing: Deep target sequencing was performed to identify SNVs for 37 established lung
cancer driver genes with an average sequencing depth of 500X. The genes were targeted with an Ion
Ampliseq panel, and enriched libraries were sequenced using P1 chips on the Ion Proton sequencer. All
laboratory analyses were performed at the Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory (CGR) of the Division
of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI. Sequence data were processed using standard Ion Torrent
Suite Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) version 5.0.7. The data processing pipeline includes signal
processing, base calling, quality score assignment, adapter trimming, read alignment to hg19, coverage
analysis and somatic variant calling. We used TVC (Torrent variant caller) version 5.0.9 to detect somatic
mutations. A somatic mutation was detected if the variant allele count >3, coverage >2 in both tumor and
normal samples and variant allele fraction ≥ 0.1. The dN/dS ratio was estimated using R package
“dNdScv” 24.

SCNA: We initially performed SCNA analysis using ASCAT 23 with default parameters, which uses both
LRR (log R ratio) and BAF (B-allele frequency). Extensive SCNAs and very complex subclonality
patterns made segmentation difficult. Thus, we modified the ASCAT to rely only on BAFs for
segmentation. Segments with BAF values different from 0.5 were identified as SCNA regions. We
compared LRR values between SCNA regions and segments with BAFs=0.5 using the Student’s t-test. If
the SCNA region LRRs were significantly higher or lower at significance level of 0.05 after adjusting for

were identified as LOH. In addition, amplifications with at least four copy numbers in oncogenes and
deletions with zero copy number in tumor suppressor genes were identified as potential driver events.
Statistical analyses
Regional genetic and epigenetic evolutionary trees for each patient were built using “fastme.bal” in an R
package “ape” that uses the minimum evolution algorithm based on a distance matrix of SCNA or
methylation profiles 25. The consensus tree was built using a revised distance matrix combining both

. Here, the denominators are used to rescale distances so that they are comparable

between SCNA and DNA methylation profiles.
The analysis of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was performed using the hierarchical
clustering based on the 5000 most variable CpG probes mapping to gene promoter regions and CpG
island regions.
Methylation analysis adjusted by sample purity
For a given CpG probe, the observed DNA methylation was a linear combination of the data from the
normal and the tumor tissue samples weighted by tumor purity. ITH may be overestimated if purity varies
across tumor samples from the same patient. Thus, we estimated purity, 𝜋𝜋, for each tumor sample and

derived the purity adjusted methylation values using R package InfiniumPurify 26. All downstream
methylation analyses were based on purity-adjusted methylation.
Quantification of ITH

The frequently used index 6 that measures ITH for a patient using the fraction of aberrations present in all
samples positively depends on the number of multi-region tumor samples. This estimate may vary across

tumors making the association analysis between ITH and clinical outcomes problematic. To address this
problem, we defined a novel ITH metric, average pairwise ITH or APITH, for each patient. For a patient
with 𝑘𝑘 tumor samples, and with 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 defined as the genomic or epigenetic distance between a pair of

samples (𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗), the APITH is defined as the average across all pairs of samples:
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 =

2
� 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .
𝑘𝑘(𝑘𝑘 − 1)
1≤𝑖𝑖<𝑗𝑗≤𝑘𝑘

The expectation of 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 does not depend on the number of multi-region tumor samples. For SCNAs,

𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is calculated as the proportion of the 705,667 probes with different copy number status for (𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗). To

investigate ITH of lung cancer driver genes 2,11,12, we also calculated 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as the fraction of the genome in
these driver gene regions with differing copy number state. For DNA methylation, we define 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as the
Euclidean distance calculated for a given set of CpG probes, e.g., all CpG probes after quality control

(QC), CpG probes mapping to CpG island and gene promoter regions. These analyses are informative to
investigate whether ITH defined based on specific genomic regions would be useful for predicting
prognosis.
The variance of the 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 estimate depends on the number of multi-region tumor samples. Intuitively,

APITH is more accurate for patients with more multi-region tumor samples and should be weighted up in
downstream statistical analyses to optimize statistical power. As described in Supplementary Methods,
we heuristically derived sample weights that were used for the weighted Cox proportional-hazards model
using “svycoxph” in the R package “survey” 27 to investigate the association between APITH and clinical
outcomes (overall survival and the risk of distant metastasis). The survival analysis was adjusted for
stage, age and smoking status. KM-plot were stratified by the median APITH of subjects with at least two
tumor samples.
