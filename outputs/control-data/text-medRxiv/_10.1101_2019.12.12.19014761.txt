Abstract

43

Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder

44

affecting women of reproductive age. Previous studies have identified genetic variants

45

associated with PCOS identified by different diagnostic criteria. The Rotterdam Criteria is the

46

broadest and able to identify the most PCOS cases.

47

Objectives: To identify novel associated genetic variants, we extracted PCOS cases and controls

48

from the electronic health records (EHR) based on the Rotterdam Criteria and performed a

49

genome-wide association study (GWAS).

50

Study Design: We developed a PCOS phenotyping algorithm based on the Rotterdam criteria

51

and applied it to three EHR-linked biobanks to identify cases and controls for genetic study. In

52

discovery phase, we performed individual GWAS using the Geisinger’s MyCode and the

53

eMERGE cohorts, which were then meta-analyzed. We attempted validation of the significantly

54

association loci (P<1x10 ) in the BioVU cohort. All association analyses used logistic regression,

55

assuming an additive genetic model, and adjusted for principal components to control for

56

population stratification. An inverse-variance fixed effect model was adopted for meta-

57

analyses. Additionally, we examined the top variants to evaluate their associations with each

58

criterion in the phenotyping algorithm. We used STRING to identify protein-protein interaction

59

network.

60

Results: We identified 2,995 PCOS cases and 53,599 controls in total (2,742cases and 51,438

61

controls from the discovery phase; 253 cases and 2,161 controls in the validation phase). GWAS

62

identified one novel genome-wide significant variant rs17186366 (OR=1.37 [1.23,1.54],

63

P=2.8x10 ) located near SOD2. Additionally, two loci with suggestive association were also

identified: rs113168128 (OR=1.72 [1.42,2.10], P=5.2 x10 ), an intronic variant of ERBB4 that is

65

independent from the previously published variants, and rs144248326 (OR=2.13 [1.52,2.86],

66

P=8.45x10 ), a novel intronic variant in WWTR1. In the further association tests of the top 3

67

SNPs with each criterion in the PCOS algorithm, we found that rs17186366 was associated with

68

polycystic and hyperandrogenism, while rs11316812 and rs144248326 were mainly associated

69

with oligomenorrhea or infertility. Besides ERBB4, we also validated the association with

70

DENND1A1.

71

Conclusion: Through a discovery-validation GWAS on PCOS cases and controls identified from

72

EHR using an algorithm based on Rotterdam criteria, we identified and validated a novel

73

association with variants within ERBB4. We also identified novel associations nearby SOD2 and

74

WWTR1. These results suggest the eGFR and Hippo pathways in the disease etiology. With

75

previously identified PCOS-associated loci YAP1, the ERBB4-YAP1-WWTR1 network implicates

76

the epidermal growth factor receptor and the Hippo pathway in the multifactorial etiology of

77

PCOS.

Introduction

83

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder that affects women

84

of reproductive age . PCOS is characterized by the three main features: dysregulation of the

85

menstrual cycle; elevated levels of androgenic hormones; and multiple cysts of the ovaries from

86

which the name of the condition is derived. Other features include hirsutism in a “male”

87

pattern, acne, increased skin pigment sometimes associated with skin tags, and weight gain.

88

Three criteria to identify women with PCOS have been proposed: the National Institutes of

89

Health (NIH) Criteria, the Rotterdam Criteria, and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AE-

90

PCOS) criteria. The NIH criteria requires both hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea ; the

91

Rotterdam criteria requires at least two of the three phenotypes: hyperandrogenism, oligo-

92

ovulation, and polycystic ovaries ; and the AE-PCOS requires both hyperandrogenism and

93

ovarian disfunction . The Rotterdam criteria is more inclusive than the other two which

94

increases its sensitivity, thus, the prevalence of PCOS estimated by the Rotterdam criteria is 15-

95

20% compared to the 7-12% generated by the other two criteria

96

Heritability estimated for PCOS ranges 38-71% by twin studies , with a polygenic genetic

97

architecture and complex inheritance pattern

98

studies (GWAS) have identified 19 loci associated with PCOS in women with European or East

131

to conduct this genetic study.

PCOS EHR algorithm based on the Rotterdam Criteria

135

Figure 1 illustrates the sample selection and analytic strategy of this study. The Geisinger PCOS

136

EHR algorithm based on the Rotterdam diagnosis criteria was first developed to identify PCOS

137

cases and controls from the EHR data. The three criteria that were used in the algorithm to

138

represent different aspects of PCOS are: 1) Polycystic (C1): having diagnosis codes of polycystic

139

ovarian syndrome and/or polycystic ovaries; 2) Hyperandrogenic (C2): having diagnosis codes

140

for hyperandrogenism or hyperandrogenism-related clinical signs or hyperandrogenemia

141

determined by testosterone measurements; 3) Reproductive (C3): having diagnosis codes for

142

oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, infertility and oligo- or anovulation. Supplementary Table 1

143

provides details and the inclusion and exclusion ICD codes and laboratory tests for each

144

criterion. PCOS cases were patients that met at least 2 of the 3 criteria with an index age

145

between 18 to 45. Controls were those who did not have any components of the three criteria,

described

153

samples were genotyped at each study site and imputed to HRC.r1-1 EUR reference genome in

154

multiple batches using the Michigan Imputation Server. Data were processed centrally and

155

harmonized as previously described

156

Samples with a genotyping rate below 95% were excluded. SNPs with a <99% call rate, minor

157

allele frequency (MAF) of <1% and a significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

158

(P<1x10 ) were removed from analyses. One of the paired individuals with first- or second-

159

degree relatedness were removed. Finally, there were 7,595,111 SNPs, 6,747,339 SNPs, and

160

5,648,769 SNPs from MyCode Phase I (1,141 cases and 18,788 controls), MyCode Phase II (594

161

cases and 9,024 controls), and eMERGE III (1,007 cases and 23,626 controls) included for GWAS.

162

For study-specific GWAS, we used fixed effects logistic regression, assuming an additive genetic

Replication for the top variants

170

Top associated variants with P<1x10 from discovery meta-analysis were further evaluated in

171

an independent PCOS cohort identified based on the same algorithm from BioVU. We identified

172

253 cases and 2161 controls. Genotypes were generated using the Illumina Infinium Expanded

173

Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array. The same imputation, quality control measures and association

174

protocols were applied for the replication study. We also queried the summary statistics of the

175

meta-analyses from the PCOS consortium (without the 23andMe data) for the associations of

176

these top variants . Criteria for replication is P<0.05, directionally consistent in the replication

177

GWAS, or P<5x10 in the combined meta-analyses.

178

Power calculation

179

We evaluated the power for our study conservatively assuming a significance level of P<5x10

180

for GWAS, and a PCOS prevalence of 8%. Given the current PCOS case number of 2995, we have

181

80% power to identify an associated variant with a MAF of 1% and an OR (odds ratio) > 2.01; or

182

a MAF at 2% and an OR > 1.68; or a MAF > 8% and an OR > 1.34.

Identification and characterization of PCOS cases and controls from EHR data

193

Figure S1 illustrates the details of sample ascertainment using the Rotterdam-based algorithm

194

in the Geisinger and eMERGE cohorts. Only non-Hispanic whites were included in the MyCode

195

and BioVU samples; All races were included in the eMERGE samples, 75% were of European

196

American, 17% were of African American and 8% were other race/ethnicity (Supplementary

197

table 2). Table 1 summarizes the numbers and characteristics of the identified cases and

198

controls. The proportion of patients with polycystic ovaries was around 40% of the PCOS cases

199

identified in the eMERGE and BioVU data; while this number is over 88% in the Geisinger

200

MyCode Phase I and II data. The Geisinger cohorts also have lower hyperandrogenic features

201

than eMERGE and BioVU cohorts. Over 90% of the patients had reproductive issues in all the

202

three cohorts. Cases showed higher BMI than controls in the MyCode and BioVU samples but

203

not in the eMERGE samples.

212

P=2.8x10 ) in the combined meta-analyses of discovery and replication. We also identified an

213

intronic variant of ERBB4, rs113168128, with near genome-wide significance (OR=1.72

214

[1.42,2.10], P=5.2 x10 ). This SNP is independent from the previously reported ERBB4 variant

[1.52,2.86], P=8.45x10 ). The regional association plots for these three loci are shown in Figure

218

S3. We also examined the top associations for African Americans in the eMERGE datasets. Only

219

rs113168128 in ERBB4 passed the standard quality check. This variant has higher MAF and a

220

slightly smaller OR with nominal significance (MAF=0.063, OR=1.64, P=0.0106).

221

We did not observe significant associations of these variants in the PCOS consortium meta-

222

analyses . We also examined the associations of previously reported PCOS loci in our meta-

223

analyses result. Only variants in DENND1A1 (rs9696009, rs10818854, rs10986105) were

224

replicated with the same direction and similar effect size (P<0.05; Supplementary table 4).

240

Principal findings

241

In this study, we developed an EHR algorithm based on the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS and

242

identified cases and controls from three biobank cohorts. Through a discovery-validation

243

GWAS, we identified rs17186366 near SOD2, a novel genome-wide significant signal associated

244

with PCOS. We validated the association of previously reported genes ERBB4 and DENND1A1,

245

with rs113168128 being an independent signal in ERBB4. We also identified rs144248326, an

246

intronic variant of WWTR1, as a novel signal close to genome-wide significance level. In further

247

association tests of the top 3 SNPs with each criterion in the PCOS algorithm, we found that

248

rs17186366 was associated with polycystic and hyperandrogenism, while rs11316812 and

249

rs144248326 were strongly associated with oligomenorrhea or infertility. The top SNPs are

252

Results and Implications

253

During case identification, we observed similar proportions in each criterion used in the

254

algorithm for the eMERGE and BioVU data, but different from the MyCode data. Around 40% of

255

the patients had polycystic ovaries in the eMERGE and BioVU cohorts, versus 88% in the

256

Geisinger cohort. This may be due to the integration of information from the patients’ problem

257

list at Geisinger or a difference in clinical practice between the systems.

258

We identified a novel genome-wide significant variant rs17186366 near SOD2, which was

259

associated with the polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism. SOD2 encodes Superoxide

260

Dismutase 2, a mitochondrial protein which converts superoxide byproducts of oxidative

261

phosphorylation to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen. Recently, A16V (rs4880) in SOD2

262

was found to be associated with PCOS, serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and the ratio of

263

LH to follicle-stimulating hormone in Han-Chinese women . rs17186366 was also found to be

264

associated with menarche in the UKB GWAS results. One retrospective study showed early or

265

late menarche were more likely to be seen in women with PCOS .

266

The association of ERBB4 with PCOS has been validated in both European and Han-Chinese

267

37

268

known variants at close to genome-wide significant level (P=5.2x10 ). ERBB4, also known as

269

human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (HER4), belongs to the EGFR family which includes

270

ERBB1, ERBB2/HER2 and ERBB3/HER3. Other than PCOS, variants of ERBB4 have been

and activate the EGFR signaling, which is critical for LH-induced steroidogenesis which

273

promotes follicular maturation

274

is highly expressed in the nerves system according to GTEx datasets, including in the

275

hypothalamus and pituitary, the two important organs in the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary-

276

adrenal (HPOA) axis. These findings suggest a disturbance in the control mechanisms of the

277

HPOA axis in PCOS.

278

WWTR1, the third gene with strong association, encodes for TAZ (transcriptional co-activator

279

with PDZ-binding motif). TAZ also contains a WW domain as the Yes-associated protein (YAP1)

280

43

281

molecules of the Hippo signaling pathway, and their expression were significantly altered in

282

PCOS tissues . Insulin resistance affects 50-70% of women with PCOS . WWTR1 and YAP1 can

283

also regulate insulin resistance. The inhibition of WWTR1/YAP1 in combination with metformin

284

can completely inhibit the effect of insulin

285

between PCOS and the Hippo pathway, suggesting potential pharmaceutical Hippo-targeted

286

interventions for treatment of PCOS with insulin resistance. Interestingly, ERBB4 can also

287

interact with WW domains in YAP1 through the PPxY motif

288

interaction network indicates the Hippo and EGFR signaling contribute to the multifactorial

289

etiology of PCOS.

290

Epidemiologic studies found that women with PCOS have a higher risk for depression, bipolar

291

disorder, anxiety, and eating disorders . In our study, we found moderate associations for the

292

top three variants with mental/behavioral disorders including depression. When queried, the

293

PheWAS and GWAS catalog through Open Targets Genetics, suggests shared genetic

294

predisposition between PCOS and mental disorders. Also, the differences in association

295

patterns across the PCOS criteria likely reflect the complex biology of PCOS and support the

296

epidemiological observations of heterogeneity in the phenotype.

297

Strengths and Limitations

298

The major strength of this study is the same phenotyping algorithm was applied through

299

different systems to ensure the homogeneity. Our PCOS algorithm was based on the Rotterdam

300

criteria and thus was broader than the NIH or AE-PCOS criteria, enabling us to identify more

301

cases than the ICD code-based method. This would improve the number of cases and avoid the

302

cases that would be identified as controls otherwise, thus increases the specificity of the study.

303

However, the algorithm assumes the same evaluation and coding practices at each healthcare

304

system and its sensitivity and specificity for case identification was not validated by chart

305

review. A potential limitation is case definition of testosterone laboratory measurement

306

(criteria2c) was unavailable in the eMERGE data. However, based on MyCode, all the patients

307

identified by this criterion also met the other two criteria. Thus, absence of this information

308

may not affect the final total case number. Also, the EHR data on luteinizing hormone and

309

follicle-stimulating hormone serum levels were limited thus we were not able to test the

310

associations with the top variants. The sample size is not large enough to identify variants with

311

small effect or low minor allele frequency, especially because PCOS is a heterogenous disorder

312

with complex etiology and combinations of clinical symptoms. For our study, we have about

313

80% power for the top 3 variants. The study cohorts are mainly European-decent individuals,

314

with a very small proportion of African Americans and other race/ethnic groups. Although the

315

variant in ERBB4 showed the same direction of effects and nominal significance (P<0.05) in the

316

African American, it has a higher minor allele frequency than in the European population.

317

Future studies focusing on minorities are necessary.

318

Conclusions

319

Through a discovery-validation GWAS on PCOS cases and controls identified from EHR using an

320

algorithm based on Rotterdam criteria, we validated the association with ERBB4. We also

321

identified novel association with SOD2 and WWTR1. Our findings highlighted the role of EGFR

322

and Hippo signaling in the disturbance of metabolic and HPOA axis in PCOS etiology.

Figure 1: Flowchart for study design. The PCOS algorithm was first developed to identify cases

476

and controls from the EHR based on Rotterdam criteria, and then applied to Geisinger patients,

477

and the eMERGE cohort. Case-control GWAS were then conducted for the three cohorts with

478

genetics data followed by fixed effect inverse-variance meta-analyses. Variants with P<1e-6

479

were then validated in BioVU samples using the same phenotype algorithm and genetics

480

analyses protocol for in meta-analysis and were queried in summary statistics from the PCOS

481

consortium. Association with each criterion in the PCOS algorithm were further tested for these

482

variants.
