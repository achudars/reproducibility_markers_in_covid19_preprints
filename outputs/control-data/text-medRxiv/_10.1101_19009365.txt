Abstract

Objectives: Observational epidemiological studies have found associations between
smoking and both poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment; however,
evaluating causality is more challenging. We used two complementary methods to attempt to
ascertain whether smoking causes poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment.

Design: A cohort study (Study One) and a two-sample Mendelian randomization study using
publicly-available summary statistics (Study Two).

Setting: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a birth-cohort
study based in Bristol, United Kingdom, and general population samples from published
genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Participants: Up to 12,004 young people in ALSPAC (complete case analysis N = 2,107)
(Study One and Study Two), and summary statistics from three previously published GWAS
(not individual-level data) (Study Two).

Main outcome measures: Cognitive ability at age 15 (assessed via the Wechsler
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) and educational attainment at age 16 (assessed via
school records) (Study One), and educational attainment (measured as years in education)
and fluid intelligence from previously published GWAS (Study Two).

Results: In Study One, heaviness of smoking at age 15 was associated with lower cognitive
ability at age 15 and lower educational attainment at age 16. Adjustment for potential
confounders and earlier cognitive ability or educational attainment attenuated findings
although evidence of an association remained (e.g., fully adjusted cognitive ability beta 0.736, 95% CI -1.238 to -0.233, P = 0.004; fully adjusted educational attainment beta -1.254,

95% CI -1.597 to -0.911, P < 0.001). Comparable results were found in sensitivity analyses
of multiply imputed data. In Study Two, two-sample Mendelian randomization indicated that
both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking lower educational attainment and cognitive
ability (e.g., smoking initiation to educational attainment inverse-variance weighted MR beta
-0.197, 95% CI -0.223, -0.171, P = 1.78 x 10-49). Educational attainment results were robust
to various sensitivity analyses, while cognition analyses were less so.

Conclusions: Our results provide evidence consistent with a causal effect of smoking on
lower educational attainment, although were less consistent for cognitive ability. The
triangulation of evidence from observational and Mendelian randomisation methods is an
important strength for causal inference.

Summary boxes:
What is already known on this topic:
Associations are seen between smoking and both educational attainment and cognition.
These is some evidence that educational attainment might causally influence smoking, but
causality in the opposite direction has not been assessed.
What this study adds:
Using multiple methodologies, we found evidence consistent with a causal effect of smoking
on lower educational attainment. An exploration of potential mechanisms could inform the
development of interventions to mitigate this risk.

Does Smoking Cause Lower Educational Attainment and General Cognitive Ability?
Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs

Introduction
Cigarette smoking is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Smoking
prevalence has declined in high income countries in recent years, but this decline has been
strongly socially patterned, with the greatest declines in the most advantaged sections of
society (1, 2). As a result, smoking is now a major driver of health inequalities between
advantaged and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. There is evidence that educational
attainment causally influences the likelihood of smoking initiation, and also heaviness of
smoking and likelihood of quitting among smokers (3, 4). However, it is less clear whether
smoking has an impact on educational attainment.
There is some evidence that young people with a history of smoking show poorer
academic and occupational outcomes compared to individuals who do not smoke or desist
soon after a period of experimentation (5-8). More generally, substance use in adolescence
has been reported to be associated with poorer educational attainment (9-11). However, it is
possible that the observed negative association between substance use and both cognitive
ability and educational attainment may result from students experiencing academic failure
being more likely to engage in substance use, for example in an attempt to manage resulting
negative feelings (12-14). In this study, we assessed the association between cigarette
smoking and cognitive ability and educational attainment in adolescents. We hypothesised
that smoking cigarettes would be associated with lower cognitive and educational outcomes.
We first used data from a large UK based pregnancy cohort, the Avon Longitudinal
Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), to investigate whether smoking, measured at age
15, was associated with cognitive ability, assessed at the same age, and educational
attainment at age 16, before and after adjustment for a range of potential confounders. We
attempted to minimise the impact of reverse causation by adjusting for pre-existing general
cognitive ability (in the general cognitive ability analyses) or earlier educational attainment (in

the education analyses). In an attempt to account for selection bias due to the typical attrition
of large cohorts, as a sensitivity analysis we imputed up to 100 datasets and repeated the
analyses.
We next used Mendelian randomization analyses of publicly-available summary data
to confirm these findings in an independent sample. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses
genetic variants as proxies for the exposure of interest to overcome problems of residual
confounding and reverse causality (15, 16), allowing for stronger causal inference. This use
of multiple methods, each with different and ideally uncorrelated strengths, limitations, and
sources of bias allows the triangulation of results to support more robust causal inference
(17-19).

Study One
Methods
Data sources. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a
prospective, population-based pregnancy cohort study that recruited 14,541 pregnant
women living in Avon, UK, with expected delivery dates between 1st April 1991 and 31st
December 1992. Of these initial pregnancies, there were a total of 14,062 live births, and
13,988 children were alive at one year of age. The cohort has been described in detail
previously (20, 21). Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and
Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. The study website contains
details of all the data available through a fully-searchable data dictionary
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).
Smoking heaviness was measured at age 15 via self-report questionnaire
administered during attendance at a clinic session. Participants were asked ‘how many times
have you smoked a cigarette in your lifetime?’ with the options never, 1-4, 5-20, 21-60, 61100 and 101+ times.

At age 15, participants were administered the Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning
subsections of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) (22). General
cognitive ability was calculated for each individual, adjusted for age. Scores were rescaled
around the complete-case sample to a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. General
cognitive ability was also measured via the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 3rd
Edition (23) at clinic at age 8.
In England, children attending state-maintained schools are educated in line with the
National Curriculum, which is split in to a series of ‘Key Stages’ assessed by compulsory
teacher assessments of national tests (www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/overview). Data
linkage between ALSPAC and the National Pupil Database (a central repository for pupillevel educational data in England) provided educational assessment data for participants
who attended state-funded school at Key Stage 4 (age 16). Data linkage was performed by a
third-party company and checked by the ALSPAC team (for further information, see
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/linkage/). Educational attainment at the
age of 16 was quantified using a standard capped scoring method (see
http://nationalpupildatabase.wikispaces.com/KS4) in which grades achieved at General
Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) or equivalent for their best eight subjects were
converted to a numerical score (A* = 58 points … G = 16 points) and summed. Capped
scores (maximum = 464) were converted to a percentage for each individual.
A number of covariates were included that may confound the association between
smoking and general cognitive ability or educational attainment. These were chosen after
studying previous literature and in line with Mokrysz and colleagues (24). They were
conceptualised as follows. Maternal and pre-birth covariates: maternal education, offspring
gender, maternal depression during pregnancy, maternal alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use
during pregnancy, all assessed via maternal questionnaire during pregnancy. Childhood
covariates: hyperactivity and conduct problems at age 11, assessed via the strengths and
difficulties questionnaire (25); depression at age 12, assessed via the moods and feelings
questionnaire (26); psychotic experiences at age 12, assessed via the PLIKS semi6

structured interview (27); suspected truancy at age 14 assessed via maternal questionnaire.
Substance use: alcohol, cannabis and other illicit drug use measured at age 15 in the same
session as the exposure.
Statistical analyses. Linear regression was used to assess the association between
cigarette smoking at age 15 and both: a) general cognitive ability at age 15, and b)
educational attainment at age 16, before and after adjustment for potential confounders.
Consistent with the work of Mokrysz and colleagues (24) we excluded individuals who had
maternal report of a head injury that resulted in unconsciousness due to the likelihood of
impact on cognitive development (28). Furthermore, we excluded any participant who
responded ‘yes’ to the question ‘have you ever used spanglers’ (a fictitious recreational drug
added to the questionnaire as a quality control check). We attempted to minimise the impact
of reverse causation by initially adjusting for pre-existing general cognitive ability (in the
general cognitive ability analyses) or earlier educational attainment (in the education
analyses) (model 2). We assessed the impact of confounding by comparing unadjusted
estimates (model 1) to those adjusting for pre-birth confounders (model 3) and childhood
confounders (model 4). We further adjusted for cannabis (model 5a), alcohol (5b) and illicit
drugs (5c), before finally running a fully adjusted model including cannabis, alcohol and illicit
drugs together (6). This approach was used to elucidate the specific impact of the
covariates, given that in our previous work we have found that these variables are highly
correlated with each other, and therefore that their individual impact on the strength of the
association could be informative (e.g. 29). All analyses were conducted in Stata version 13
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). The complete case sample N for both analyses was
2,107.
Sensitivity Analyses. In order to investigate whether selection bias due to attrition
could be impacting on the complete case analysis, multiple imputation with chained
equations up to the outcome sample size was carried out for each analysis. An interaction
term was included to allow us to account for earlier head injury (29). We imputed up to 100
datasets, using approximately 50 auxiliary variables to predict missing values. These

included further pre-birth and childhood variables, other measures of intelligence or
cognition, and earlier substance use measures. The imputed sample N was 4,954 for the
general cognitive ability analysis, and 12,004 for the education analysis (as this variable was
from linkage data and therefore available on many more individuals).

Results
At age 15, 28.5% of the complete case sample of 2,107 individuals reported having
smoked a cigarette, and 7.5% reported smoking more than 100 times. Table 1 shows the
descriptive statistics of the covariates included in the model, stratified by heaviness of
smoking. Smoking was associated with all covariates other than maternal depressive
symptoms.

Insert Table 1 about here.

General cognitive ability. Heaviness of smoking at age 15 was associated with a
reduction in general cognitive ability of 1.4 points per increase in category of smoking
heaviness (95% CI -1.77 to -0.95), in an unadjusted analysis. After adjustment for earlier
general cognitive ability, the magnitude of this association attenuated by over a third,
although evidence of an association remained strong. Further adjustment for pre-birth and
childhood confounders attenuated the association slightly further, but again strong evidence
of an association remained. The addition of cannabis, alcohol or other illicit drugs slightly
increased (model 5a and 5b) or decreased (model 5c) the size of the association. The fully
adjusted model suggested a reduction in general cognitive ability of 0.7 points per increase
in category of smoking heaviness (95% CI -1.24 to -0.23). The results are shown in Table 2.

Educational attainment. Heaviness of smoking was associated with a 2.5 percentage
point decrease in educational attainment score per increase in category of smoking
heaviness in the unadjusted analysis (95% CI -2.87 to -2.17). As for associations with
general cognitive ability, the effect size attenuated substantially after adjustment for earlier
educational attainment. Adjustment for childhood covariates and substance use further
attenuated the associations, although strong evidence of an association remained. The fully
adjusted model (model 6) indicated a 1.3 percentage point decrease in education score
associated with each increase in smoking heaviness category (95% CI -1.60 to -0.91).
These results are shown in Table 3.

Insert Table 3 about here.

Multiple imputation. In the 100 imputed datasets, unadjusted associations between
cigarette use and cognitive ability were somewhat smaller in magnitude than those seen in
the complete case analysis (effect estimate -1.17, 95% CI -1.43 to -0.92). Adjustment for
pre-birth and childhood confounders led to further attenuation. There was a small attenuation
after further adjustment for cannabis, alcohol or other illicit drug use. Although effect sizes
were smaller, the confidence intervals were consistent with those from the complete case
analysis.
Conversely, the associations between cigarette use and educational attainment were
larger in the imputed analyses than the complete case analysis (effect estimate -4.69, 95%
CI -5.05 to -4.34). The pattern of attenuation was similar to that seen in the complete case
analyses, although for the most part confidence intervals did not overlap with the complete
case analyses. These results are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Our results indicate that smoking cigarettes at age 15 was associated with reduced
cognitive ability (i.e., vocabulary and reasoning) as measured at age 15 by the WASI, and
with poorer educational attainment (i.e., grades in key stage 4 national tests) at age 16. In an
attempt to minimize the possibility that our results were due to cognitive ability and
educational attainment making individuals more likely to smoke, we adjusted our analyses
for pre-existing general cognitive ability and earlier educational attainment. This attenuated
the observed associations, although strong evidence of an association remained. Although it
is important to note that this pattern of attenuation is also consistent with a null causal effect
and measurement error being present (30).
Associations also remained when adjusted for substance use, although we did
observe some attenuation consistent with the literature suggesting that substance use is
associated with poor cognitive performance and educational attainment (13). For example,
cannabis is related to poorer overall learning and impaired memory (31-33). Likewise,
alcohol use has been reported to be negatively associated with educational attainment and
to long-lasting changes in the adult brain (13, 34). Multiple imputation of missing data
allowed us to predict missing variables and, consequently, to include a larger number of
ALSPAC subjects in the analysis. The results of imputation analyses for cognitive ability
were broadly consistent with those seen in the complete case analysis although the strength
of the associations was attenuated. Conversely, the coefficients from the imputed analyses
for educational attainment were much larger than for the complete case analysis, without
overlapping confidence intervals, although the pattern of attenuation after adjustment for
covariates was comparable. It is possible that this is due to the larger proportion of data
being imputed or due to the larger sample size available for educational attainment
compared to cognitive ability.

Study Two
Methods
Data sources. We conducted two-sample MR of two smoking phenotypes (smoking
initiation and lifetime smoking) on cognitive ability and educational attainment. For the
smoking initiation instrument, we used summary data for the 378 independent genome-wide
significant SNPs identified by the GSCAN consortium GWAS (35). For lifetime smoking
(combined smoking duration, cessation and heaviness), we used summary statistics
reported by Wootton and colleagues (36). The instrument consisted of 126 independent
SNPs. For cognitive ability we used a GWAS of fluid intelligence conducted in the UK
Biobank by the Neale lab (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/). For the smoking initiation
analysis we used betas from the GSCAN GWAS with UK Biobank removed to avoid sample
overlap. This was not possible for the lifetime smoking GWAS so this analysis was not
conducted. For educational attainment, we used the second GWAS from the SSGAC
consortium (37) discovery sample. This GWAS was chosen rather than a more recently
published GWAS (38) as there was no sample overlap between exposure and outcome
samples (the more recent GWAS uses Biobank data, as does the smoking GWAS).
Educational attainment was defined as number of completed years of schooling.
Statistical analysis. We conducted four methods of Mendelian randomisation:
inverse-variance weighted, MR Egger (39), weighted median (40), weighted mode (41).
Each makes different assumptions about the presence of pleiotropy. A consistent direction of
effect across all four methods provides the strongest evidence for a causal effect. We further
calculated the MR Egger intercept, an indicator of directional pleiotropy (39). Finally, Steiger
filtering was used to confirm the hypothesised direction of effect (42). Here, each SNP is
examined individually to ensure that it explains more variance in the exposure than outcome.
If a SNP explains more variance in the outcome, this could indicate that the outcome actually
precedes the exposure on the causal pathway. Where this occurs, all analyses are re-run
with these SNPs removed. All analyses were conducted using MR Base, a package for twosample MR (43) in R (R. Core Team., 2013).

As a sensitivity analysis, multivariable MR (MVMR) was performed to investigate the
independent effects of genetic liability to ADHD and smoking on cognitive ability and
educational attainment (44, 45). If genetic liability to smoking initiation includes elements of
impulsivity, or other related (e.g., risk-taking) traits, simultaneously modelling genetic liability
to ADHD (as a marker of impulsivity) and smoking should help to disentangle this
relationship. MVMR is an extension of MR that uses genetic variants associated with
multiple exposures to simultaneously model the causal effect of each exposure on the
outcome (44). These analyses were performed in the ALSPAC dataset from Study One.
A further sensitivity analysis using the ALSPAC dataset investigated associations
between a standardised polygenic risk score for lifetime smoking, and smoking initiation with
IQ measured at age 8 using the WISC. The purpose of this was to investigate the
association between genetic factors associated with smoking and the outcome of interest
prior to any smoking being likely to have occurred, as a negative control to test the
assumption made in the later Mendelian randomization study that the SNPs have no direct
effect on education aside from via the pathway of smoking. Polygenic risk scores were
calculated using PLINK ‘score’ command. Genome-wide significant SNPs were identified in
the previous GWAS of lifetime smoking (Wootton et al., 2018) and smoking initiation (35)
and weighted by the effect sizes found in these GWAS. The WISC continuous total score
was used as the outcome.

Results
General cognitive ability.
There was some evidence for an adverse effect of smoking initiation on cognitive
ability (IVW MR -0.82, 95% CI -1.04, -0.60, P = 5.36 x 10-13), and the direction of effect was
consistent across all methods (see Table 4). Steiger filtering indicated that 86% of the SNPs
for smoking initiation explained more variance in cognitive ability than smoking phenotypes
(see Table 5). After Steiger filtering, the effects of smoking initiation on cognitive ability
attenuated to the null (IVW MR 0.04, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.38, P = 0.81).

Multivariable MR. When estimating the causal effect of both genetic liability to ADHD
and smoking initiation, there was strong evidence of an association of a negative effect of
genetic liability to ADHD on cognitive ability (-0.171, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.09, P = 9.14 x 10-5),
independently of smoking initiation. There was also some evidence of an association for a
negative effect of genetic liability to smoking initiation on cognitive ability (-0.405, 95% CI 0.72 to -0.09, P = 0.012), independently of ADHD. However, there was some evidence of
pleiotropy within these instruments and instrument strength was weak. As such these
estimates should be interpreted with caution. These results are shown in Table 6.

Insert Tables 4 and 5 about here.

Educational attainment. Of the 126 SNPs associated with lifetime smoking (36), all
were available in the GWAS of educational attainment (37) and the GWAS of cognitive
ability (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/). Of the 378 SNPs associated with smoking
initiation (35), 371 were available in the GWAS of educational attainment (37) and 376 were
available in the GWAS of cognitive ability (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/). For both
smoking phenotypes, there was a consistent adverse effect of smoking on educational
attainment across all four MR methods (see Table 4). The evidence was strongest for the
effect of smoking initiation on educational attainment with genetic risk for smoking initiation
associated with a 0.39 SD decrease in years of schooling (95% CI -0.456 to -0.330, P = 1.35
x 10-34). Both MR Egger intercepts suggested weak evidence of directional pleiotropy. After
Steiger filtering, 94% of SNPs were retained for the lifetime smoking analysis, and 75% of
SNPs for the smoking initiation analysis (see Table 5), and the resultant analyses found
strong evidence for an effect of smoking on educational attainment (e.g., for lifetime
smoking, using 119 of the 126 original SNPs IVW MR -0.359, 95% CI -0.418 to -0.299, P =
1.81 x 10-32).
Multivariable MR. When estimating the independent causal effects of genetic liability
to ADHD and smoking initiation, there was strong evidence of a negative effect of genetic

liability to ADHD on educational attainment (-0.064, 95% CI: -0.088, -0.041, p=6.86x10-8).
We also found strong evidence of a negative effect of genetic liability to smoking initiation on
educational attainment (-0.288, 95% CI -0.375 to -0.20, P = 2.33 x 10-10). Similar effects
were found when looking at ADHD and lifetime smoking, with strong evidence of a negative
effect of genetic liability to both ADHD (-0.073, 95% CI -0.104 to -0.042, P = 2.41x10-6) and
lifetime smoking (-0.279, 95% CI -0.362 to -0.197, P = 1.93x10-11) on educational attainment.
These results are shown in Table 6. However, in both analyses, there was evidence of
pleiotropy and instrument strength was weak (Supplementary Table 3).

Sensitivity analyses. In the ALSPAC dataset associations were found between the
polygenic risk scores for both lifetime smoking and smoking initiation, with IQ measured at
age 8 years. This was true in the whole sample (N=5,300), and when restricted to individuals
who reported never having tried a cigarette (N=4,650). These results are shown in Table 7.
The multivariable MR examining smoking and ADHD on IQ at age 15 was also run in the
ALSPAC sample, although this was very underpowered (see Supplementary Table 4).

Insert Table 7 about here.

Discussion
These results broadly replicate the findings from our observational analyses in Study
One, and provide some evidence for a causal effect of smoking on education. The results for
cognitive ability are more mixed, but may indicate common genetic influence on both
cognition and smoking. Interestingly, there was stronger evidence for pleiotropy in the
analysis of lifetime smoking on educational attainment, compared with the analysis of

smoking initiation on educational attainment. Given that educational attainment is largely
realised by early adulthood, smoking initiation may be the more appropriate exposure to
examine (unlike for most outcomes, where the effects of smoking develop over a lifetime of
exposure). We have also previously shown that educational attainment impacts on smoking
(3, 4, 46), with these effects likely to continue to play out over the lifetime (e.g., via effects on
heaviness of smoking and smoking cessation). Interestingly, multivariable MR analyses
suggest that there is no independent effect of general cognitive ability on smoking when the
effect of educational attainment is taken into account (4).
Taken together, these results and our previous findings indicate a complex,
bidirectional causal relationship between smoking and educational attainment. Evidence for
the causal effect of smoking on cognition is more mixed. This is perhaps to be expected, as
cognition is less susceptible to the impact of the environment than educational attainment is
likely to be (47). It is also important to bear in mind that MR analyses between lifetime
smoking and cognitive ability were not possible due to the use of UK Biobank data in both
the exposure and outcome GWAS. The implementation of Steiger filtering and subsequent
removal of 86% of the 376 initial SNPs may indicate evidence of reverse causality or a
common biological cause, although power is reduced for these analyses due to the removal
of identified SNPs. Critically, the results of our negative control analyses, which indicate that
the genetic instruments for smoking are associated with general cognitive ability before
individuals have begun smoking, suggests direct effects of these variants on cognition. One
possibility is that these variants capture a common mechanism (e.g., trait impulsivity) that
has effects on both smoking and cognition, and we explored this using the MVMR analysis.

General Discussion
Our study provides observational evidence that smoking is associated with reduced
general cognitive ability and educational attainment (Study One), and MR evidence that the
associations with educational attainment are likely to be causal (Study Two). These results

provide further support for the importance of preventive interventions in schools to reduce
the uptake of smoking in young people. The triangulation of results across different methods,
each with their own strengths, limitations and sources of bias, is an important strength of our
approach, and allows us to be more confident that our results reflect genuine causal
relationships, and are robust.
There are a number of limitations to this study that should be considered. First,
smoking was based on self-report as there was no objective measure available in either our
observational or MR analyses. Second, in our observational analyses, the WASI was not
used in its entirety and therefore the estimated score was less reliable than a full IQ score
(Mokrysz et al., 2016). Third, our observational analyses are cross sectional, meaning
reverse causality cannot be ruled out, although we attempt to minimise any impact by
adjusting for earlier cognitive ability or educational attainment. Similarly, we cannot exclude
the possibility that a common risk factor is operating that influences both smoking and lower
cognitive abilities and educational attainment. However, the results from our MR analyses
protect against this and allow us to triangulate the results of both approaches to suggest that
smoking does indeed causally influence educational attainment. Indeed, the results of our
negative control analyses in ALSPAC provide some evidence for this possibility.
MR should in principle allow us to assess the associations between smoking and
education without the confounding from socio-economic status, if the assumptions of MR
have been met. However, if individuals who smoke are more likely to reproduce with other
individuals who smoke, as some studies have indicated (48), the assumptions made by MR
may not hold true. Given the social patterning of smoking behaviour, cigarette use might be
a marker for many aspects of deprivation that would likely impact on years of education (for
example the need to leave school to begin employment), an interpretation that cannot be
ruled out by these data. Relatedly, it may be the case that the questions used are capturing
different phenotypes to those intended. This may be the case for smoking initiation – asking
an individual whether they have ever tried smoking may be a strong predictor of traits such
as impulsivity, rather than smoking itself. However, there is evidence from other studies

using different designs that do not have these limitations that smoking might causally impact
on educational attainment, including instrumental variable analyses in different cultural
settings (49), allowing for further triangulation of results.
It has long been suggested that nicotine may be a cognitive enhancer, which is
apparently paradoxical given our results. A number of studies have found that acute nicotine
intoxication can transiently improve cognitive abilities (50). However, the acute effects of a
substance may differ from the longer-term impact of regular use. For example, regular
cigarette users often report that smoking will reduce feelings of anxiety, while regular
smoking is predictive of increased subsequent anxiety (51). Nicotine withdrawal may be
responsible for both these seemingly contradictory effects – the removal of nicotine
withdrawal symptoms could appear to improve cognitive ability and mood, by reversing
impairment caused by withdrawal symptoms (50, 52). It is also interesting to note the
difference between long-term smoking and the impact of acute nicotine in the lab, which is
often delivered via routes other than smoking (53). The mechanisms by which cigarette use
might impact on educational attainment are harder to elucidate. There is some evidence to
suggest that smoking may lead to adverse mental health outcomes, or externalising
behaviours (54). It is possible that these, in turn, could influence educational outcomes
and/or cognitive ability, although our data cannot interrogate this hypothesis directly.
We have used two different methodologies to investigate the link between smoking
and education and cognitive ability. Results from both studies suggest that smoking can
affect educational attainment as early in life as adolescence. While both methods used have
limitations, they have different limitations, and therefore the consistency across both
methods provides further evidence that this is a true effect, rather than a product of bias or
confounding. Future research should strive to ascertain the mechanisms that underpin this
association, which could inform early interventions aimed at preventing smoking uptake, for
example within the school environment, as these could support higher educational
attainment and, ultimately, reduce the health and social inequality that derives from both
smoking and low education.

Model 2 – as model 1 with additional adjustment for educational attainment at age 11; Model 3 – as model 2 with additional adjustment for prebirth confounders (gender, maternal education, maternal smoking, alcohol and cannabis use during pregnancy, maternal depression); Model 4
– as model 3 with additional adjustment for childhood confounders (truancy, hyperactivity, conduct problems, psychotic-like experiences,
depression); Model 5a – as model 4 with additional adjustment for cannabis use at age 15; Model 5b – as model 4 with additional adjustment
for alcohol use at age 15; Model 5c – as model 4 with additional adjustment for illicit drug use at age 15 Model 6 – as model 4 with additional
adjustment for cannabis, alcohol and other illicit drug use at age 15.
