Abstract
Background: Treatment responsiveness of tinea has decreased considerably in recent past in
India. We tested effectiveness of oral terbinafine daily plus fluconazole weekly (TFw) and
terbinafine daily plus fluconazole daily (TFd) versus oral terbinafine daily (T) in tinea
corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in a pragmatic randomized open trial.
Methods: One hundred and seventeen microscopy confirmed patients were allocated to T (6
mg/kg/day), TFw (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day+fluconazole 12 mg/kg once weekly), or TFd
(terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day+fluconazole 6 mg/kg/day) groups by concealed randomization and
treated for 8 weeks or cure. Each group included 39 patients.
Results: At 4 weeks, 9 (23.1%), 8 (20.5%) and 14 (35.9%) patients were cured in T, TFw
and TFd groups, respectively (P=0.279). At 8 weeks, number of patients cured was as
follows: T 13 (33.3%), TFw 18 (46.2%) and TFd 25 (64.1%). TFd was more effective than T
(P=0.012), other comparisons were not significantly different. However, effect size as
calculated by number needed to treat (NNT) (versus terbinafine) was 8 for TFw and 4 for
TFd. Relapse rates one month after cure were similar in all groups (P=0.664).
Conclusions: In view of cure rates and NNT, terbinafine plus daily fluconazole is more
effective than terbinafine alone or terbinafine plus weekly fluconazole in current epidemic of
altered dermatophytosis in India.

Introduction
Unprecedented changes in the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment responsiveness
of tinea infections have been noted in recent past in India.1-4 Recent data show that
effectiveness of oral terbinafine,5, 6 fluconazole, itraconazole and griseofulvin has decreased
considerably, even with 8 weeks of treatment.6 Decreased effectiveness of terbinafine has
been attributed to mutation in the squalene epoxidase gene.7,8 Importance of finding effective
methods of treating tinea cannot be overemphasized.
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that using a regimen consisting of more than
one oral antifungal drugs may produce better treatment outcome. We performed a three-arm
pragmatic randomized open trial comparing effectiveness of oral terbinafine daily (T, active
control) versus two experimental regimens, terbinafine daily plus fluconazole weekly (TFw)
and terbinafine daily plus fluconazole daily (TFd).
Methods
Setting
The study (registered with Clinical Trials Registry-India, registration number
CTRI/2017/12/010770) was conducted at a tertiary care centre after obtaining approval from
the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University.
Sample size
A sample size of 35 patients in each group was determined using expected cure rates of 30%
and 70% with the control and experimental regimens with type I error rate of 0.05, type II
error rate of 0.1 and dropout rate of 20%.9

Selection criteria and enrolment
Patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris or tinea faciei or a combination of these conditions
were included in the trial. Inclusion criteria were (a) clinical diagnosis of tinea corporis, tinea
cruris or tinea faciei, (b) microscopic confirmation (potassium hydroxide [KOH]
microscopy), (c) age 4 to 80 years, and (d) no treatment with terbinafine or fluconazole in last
one month. Exclusion criteria were (a) presence of any other type(s) of tinea, e.g.,
onychomycosis, (b) pregnancy, (c) lactation, (d) inability to come for follow-up, (e) history
of adverse reaction to terbinafine and/or fluconazole, (f) abnormal baseline investigations
(complete blood count [CBC], liver and renal function tests [LFT, RFT]), (g) current
treatment with drugs likely to cause interaction with terbinafine and/or fluconazole, and (h)
history of renal, liver or cardiac disease or chest pain. A witnessed, written and informed
consent was given by the patients, or by a parent in case of minor patients. All female
patients of child bearing age were advised to avoid pregnancy during treatment.
Five hundred and fifty-seven patients with clinical diagnosis of tinea corporis, tinea cruris or
tinea faciei or a combination of these conditions attending dermatology outpatient department
were assessed for eligibility. A total of 117 patients satisfied the selection criteria and were
assigned to one of the three treatment groups by block randomization on the basis of random
numbers generated online using Research Randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org/). Each
treatment group comprised 39 patients (Figure 1) (allocation ratio 1:1:1). Patients were
enrolled from September 2017 to November 2017. Allocation was concealed using
sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes, which contained the allocation code
written on a folded paper, the envelopes were opened after enrolment of the patients. Both
random sequence generation and allocation concealment were done by a person unrelated to
the trial.

Interventions
Dosing schedule of terbinafine was 6 mg/kg/day in all treatment groups. Patients in the TFw
group, in addition, received fluconazole 12 mg/kg once a week. To ensure good compliance,
a day of the week was fixed for fluconazole intake for this group of patients. Patients in the
TFd group received fluconazole 6 mg/kg/day along with daily terbinafine. Patients were
advised against using any other treatment.
Follow-up
Following data were recorded for each patient: body surface area (BSA) affected, treatment
given, investigations (CBC, LFT, RFT) at baseline, followed by CBC and LFT every 2
weeks, microscopy results, and follow-up data. The most severe lesion was identified as the
index lesion, from which scraping and KOH microscopy was performed at baseline and then
at every subsequent visit. Patients were followed up at 2 weekly intervals up to a maximum
of 8 weeks or cure, whichever occurred earlier.
Measurement of treatment effect
Cure was defined as occurrence of both clinical cure (complete clearance of lesions) and
microscopic cure (negative KOH microscopy). Presence of post-inflammatory
hyperpigmentation at the site of healed tinea was not considered a feature of tinea. Any of the
following was considered treatment failure (a) no improvement or worsening of the disease in
4 weeks in patientâ€™s assessment, (b) presence of skin lesions at 8 weeks, and (c) positive
microscopy at 8 weeks. Patients who were cured were asked whether they were fully satisfied
with the treatment outcome or not. Patients in whom the treatment failed were treated with
oral itraconazole outside the clinical trial.

Measurement of compliance
Patients were asked to bring used strips of tablets and the strips in use at each follow up visit
to assess compliance. Compliance was considered to be good if a patient had taken 80% or
more of the prescribed number of tablets, and poor if less than 80% tablets were taken during
treatment.
Assessment for relapse
Those patients who were cured were assessed again 1 month after the cure to look for relapse
of tinea.
Outcome measures
Number of patients cured at 8 weeks with the different regimens was the primary outcome
measure. Secondary outcome measures included number of patients cured at 4 weeks, relapse
rate, and frequency of adverse events. In addition, severity of itching was noted on a 0 to 3
scale (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) at baseline and subsequent follow-ups.
Statistical analysis
For the baseline variables, mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile
range (IQR) were calculated depending on the distribution of data. Number of patients who
had used topical steroid, cure rates, relapse rates and compliance were compared by Fisher
exact test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All P vales are two-tailed.
Absolute risk reduction (ARR) of treatment failure versus the control (terbinafine daily) and
number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. When appropriate, 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated. Intention to treat analysis was performed for the efficacy data.
Compliance data were analysed on per protocol basis. Denominator for calculating
compliance was the total number of patients who were cured and those who came for follow

ups up to 8 weeks but were not cured. Denominator for calculation of relapse rate was the
number of patients who had achieved cure. For calculating relapse rate, those cured patients
who could not be followed up were considered relapsed.
Results
Baseline characterises of the patients
Patients in the 3 groups were comparable at baseline with regard to age, duration of tinea, and
body surface area affected (Table 1).
Fifty-three patients had tinea corporis et cruris, 24 tinea corporis, 19 tinea corporis et cruris et
faciei, 10 tinea cruris, 6 tinea faciei, 4 tinea corporis et faciei, and 1 patient had tinea cruris et
faciei. Fifty patients had received some treatment in past 1 month, these included topical
steroid combinations by 25 patients (8, 8, and 9 patients in T, TFw, and TFd, respectively,
P=0.999), oral itraconazole by 9 patients, topical antifungal and topical salicylic acid by 6
patients each, and oral steroid by 4 patients.
Cure rates at 4 weeks
At 4 weeks, 9 (23.1%), 8 (20.5%) and 14 (35.9%) patients were cured in T, TFw and TFd
groups, respectively (Figure 1) (intention to treat analysis). The cure rates were not
significantly different (P=0.279).
Cure rates at 8 weeks
Thirteen (33.3%, 95% CI 20.6 to 49.1), 18 (46.2%, CI 31.6 to 61.4) and 25 (64.1%, CI 48.4
to 77.3) patients were cured at 8 weeks in T, TFw and TFd groups, respectively (P= 0.026)
(Figure 1) (intention to treat analysis). Comparisons of different pairs of treatment groups
showed that TFd was more effective than T (P=0.012), while other pairs were not
significantly different with regard to cure rates at 8 weeks (Table 2).

Severity of itching
Severity of itching decreased in all treatment groups as the treatment progressed and itching
was absent in all patients at the time of cure (Table 3).
Relapse rates
Three out of 13 cured patients (23%, 95% CI 7.5 to 50.9), 3 of 18 (16.7%, CI 16.7, 5.0 to
40.1) and 7 of 25 (28%, CI 14.1 to 47.8) patients relapsed within a month of cure in the
treatment groups T, TFw and TFd, respectively (Figure 1). Relapse rates were not
significantly different among the 3 groups (P=0.664).
Compliance
Thirty out of 33 patients, 21 of 30, and 29 of 32 patients had good compliance in the T, TFw,
and TFd groups, respectively. The difference was not significant (P= 0.053).
Patientsâ€™ satisfaction with treatment outcome
All patients who were cured were fully satisfied with the outcome.
Number needed to treat
Number needed to treat (NNT) for the experimental group TFw was 8 and for TFd it was 4
(Table 4).
Adverse events
One patient in the TFw group was detected to have thrombocytopenia (platelet count
<100,000/Âµl) at 2 weeks and 2 patients in the TFd group were detected to have raised serum
glutamic pyruvic transaminase enzyme levels (>100 u/l) at 4 weeks. All 3 patients reported
no symptoms due to these derangements. Treatment was stopped in these 3 patients. Test
results became normal in subsequent investigations performed after 2 weeks. No other
adverse events were detected on investigations and none were reported by the patients.

Discussion
Present study was conducted in view of unprecedented changes in epidemiology, clinical
features and treatment responsiveness of tinea infections in recent past in India.1-4
Effectiveness of oral terbinafine,5, 6 fluconazole, itraconazole and griseofulvin has decreased
considerably, even with 8 weeks of treatment, in recent studies conducted in India.6
Furthermore, problems of chronicity as well as frequent relapses occurring within weeks of
apparent cure have been noted.10 It is obviously important that new treatment methods are
tested for their effectiveness in tinea infections.
We tested the hypothesis that using a multidrug therapy regimen may produce better
treatment outcome in tinea. Terbinafine and fluconazole were selected as the two antifungal
agents for multidrug therapy because they have different mechanisms of action. Effectiveness
of two experimental regimens, oral terbinafine daily plus oral fluconazole weekly (TFw) and
oral terbinafine daily plus oral fluconazole daily (TFd), was compared with oral terbinafine
alone given daily (T, active control) within a randomized pragmatic open design.
Cure rates at 4 weeks with the three treatments were not significantly different. Comparison
of cure rates at 8 weeks showed that TFd was more effective than T, while TFw was similar
in efficacy to T. Although comparison of cure rates at 8 weeks with TFd (64.1%) and TFw
(46.2%) did not reach significance, effect size as calculated by number needed to treat (NNT)
(versus terbinafine) showed that TFd was more effective than TFw.
NNT for the experimental group TFw was 8 and for TFd it was 4; meaning thereby that,
compared to terbinafine alone, 8 patients need to be treated with TFw to achieve one
additional cure, while only 4 patients need to be treated with TFd for the same effect. Thus,
TFd was the most effective treatment out of the treatments tested.

Compliance and relapse rates were similar in the three groups. One patient in the TFw group
had thrombocytopenia and 2 patients in the TFd group had raised serum glutamic pyruvic
transaminase enzyme levels. These changes were reversible, however, it is important to
closely monitor liver enzymes with such regimen.
Recent data from randomized pragmatic trials, comparing different drugs and regimens, have
shown that itraconazole (5 mg/kg/day) given for 8 weeks had cure rate of 66% in chronic and
chronic-relapsing tinea,6 and cure rate of 78.3% when all patients with tinea were treated
irrespective of the duration of illness.11 However, it may be noted that there are limitations
with itraconazole, especially with regard to drug interactions and cardiac adverse effects. In
such patients, when itraconazole cannot be given, a regimen consisting of terbinafine plus
daily fluconazole may be an effective option.
A limitation of the present study is that it was not blinded.
Data presented herein show that it may be worthwhile to consider treatment with oral
terbinafine plus daily fluconazole as a treatment option for tinea corporis, tinea cruris and
tinea faciei in selected patients in the current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India.
