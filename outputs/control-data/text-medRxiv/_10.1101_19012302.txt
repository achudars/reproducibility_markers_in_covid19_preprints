Abstract

33

Introduction

34

High rates of pre-treatment loss to care among persons diagnosed with HIV persist. Linkage to care

35

can be improved through active digitally-based surveillance. Currently, record-keeping for HIV

36

diagnoses in South Africa is paper-based. Aggregated testing data are reported routinely, and only

37

discordant findings result in a specimen being tested at a laboratory and digitised.

38

Methods

39

The Western Cape Province in South Africa has a Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC) where

40

person-level routine data are consolidated in a single database, leveraging the existence of a unique

41

patient identifier. To facilitate improved surveillance, a pre-carbonated point-of-care test (PoCT)

42

form was piloted, where one copy was routed to the centralised laboratory and digitised for PHDC

43

inclusion. We evaluated the utility of the intervention using cross-sectional and retrospective cohort

44

analyses, as well as comparisons with reported aggregate data.

45

Results

46

From May 2017 to June 2018, 11337 digitised point-of-care HIV testing records were linked to the

47

PHDC. Overall, 96% of records in the aggregate dataset were digitised, with 97% linked to the PHDC.

48

Of those tested, 79% were female (median age 27 years). Linkage demonstrated that 51.3% of

49

patients testing HIV-positive were retesting. Of those truly newly diagnosed, 81% were linked to HIV

50

care and 25% were initiated on antiretroviral therapy immediately.

51

Conclusion

52

Digitisation of PoCT results is feasible and provides individuated HIV testing data to assist in linkage

53

to care and in differentiating newly diagnosed patients from positive patients retesting. Actionable

Introduction

57
58

The last decade has seen marked changes in the management of the global HIV epidemic. The

59

United Nation’s programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) set the 90-90-90 targets in 2015, aiming to

60

diagnose 90% of those who are HIV infected, treat 90% of those diagnosed HIV-positive and virally

61

suppress 90% of those receiving antiretroviral treatment [1]. These targets provide a framework for

62

the universal test-and-treat principle introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015

63

[2].

64

HIV diagnosis is the first step of several along the HIV treatment cascade towards viral suppression

65

[1]. That many people do not immediately proceed beyond this first step reflects a system failure;

66

high rates of pre-treatment loss-to-care among persons diagnosed HIV-positive have been reported

67

in sub-Saharan Africa [3][4][5]. If we are to meet the 90-90-90 targets it is essential that we improve,

68

and accurately measure, linkage to HIV care for those newly diagnosed with HIV.

69

In South Africa, as with many countries in the region, HIV testing is based on a point-of-care test

70

(PoCT) algorithm; only discordant findings result in a specimen being sent to a laboratory. This is

71

against a backdrop of what is otherwise a comprehensive national laboratory information system

72

(LIS) in which all laboratory test results performed anywhere in the country in the public sector are

73

accessible on a central LIS, and can contribute to surveillance activities [6]. The move towards

74

universal access to treatment, and high targets for identifying those infected with HIV, requires that

75

the treatment cascade is monitored from the point of HIV testing. At testing facilities, PoCT HIV

76

results are currently entered manually into a paper-based register, with aggregated data then

77

submitted to the District Health Information System on a monthly basis.

78

The Western Cape Province has recently developed a Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC) in which

79

all person-level hospital and clinic administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy records, and data from

80

disease information systems for HIV and TB, are consolidated in a single environment, leveraging the

81

existence of a unique patient identifier which is used as the folder number in all health facilities in

82

the public sector [7]. Within this environment, disease-specific patient cascades (virtual cohorts),

83

such as the HIV treatment cascade, are in development using specific markers of care. In the HIV

84

treatment cascade, electronic evidence of having HIV is based on laboratory markers (where PoCT is

85

discordant or contra-indicated, or from other laboratory tests often conducted shortly after

86

diagnosis, such as CD4 tests and viral load) as well as ICD-10 coding, for which the poor

87

completeness and quality in the public sector is known [8–10]. The HIV cascade includes treatment

88

information, such as initiation dates, regimen details, last dispensing dates, as well as information on

89

viral suppression.

90

Recently, considerable media attention was given to a proposed PEPFAR funding cut for South

91

Africa due to apparent poor performance of South African HIV programmes [11]. Although this

92

proposed funding cut was later reversed, it was widely appreciated that improved performance

93

could be supported through digital solutions which include routine electronic monitoring of all

94

persons newly diagnosed with HIV and their subsequent care.

95

To facilitate improved HIV surveillance, the Department of Health in the Western Cape implemented

96

a pilot intervention to digitise PoCT HIV test results with support from the laboratory transport

97

mechanism and information system. PoCT results were thus available electronically at a population

98

and an individual level. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and utility of this pilot intervention

99

at a local Community Health Centre (CHC), in meeting reporting requirements, and more importantly

100

providing a province-wide individuated actionable reporting mechanism for assessing and improving

101

linkage to care of clients newly diagnosed with HIV.

Methods

102
103

The intervention was evaluated by applying cross-sectional and retrospective cohort analyses, as

104

well as comparisons with reported aggregate data. The study population included all patients

105

accessing HIV Testing Services (HTS) at Gugulethu CHC between May 2017 to June 2018. This

106

included patients attending HTS as part of routine antenatal care, patients referred for HTS and

107

those self-presenting for HTS. No formal recruitment was required as existing records in routine

108

databases housed by the Department of Health were used for the evaluation.

109

At the facility, trained HIV counsellors obtained informed consent and performed the rapid PoCT HIV

110

assays as per National protocol [12]. Carbonated copies of standard HTS forms completed at the

111

facility were transported via routine systems to a central point for data capturing and inclusion in

112

the LIS and PHDC. From May to December 2017 (Phase I) data was entered by a dedicated capturer

113

located at the Provincial Department of Health. From January to June 2018 (Phase II), capturing was

114

undertaken by data clerks at the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS). Elements documented

115

on the paper forms and digitised included patient identifiers, demographic data, testing consent,

116

self-reported previous HIV test result, reason for accessing HTS and results of the rapid HIV PoCT.

117

HIV status was calculated using the National Department of Health HIV testing algorithm [12].

118

Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel and Stata 14 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas,

119

USA). The PHDC provided de-identified linked data for the analyses at study closure.

120

Patients attending HTS were described using appropriate descriptive statistics. Data were linked to

121

the Patient Master Index and existing HIV cascade of the PHDC using patient folder numbers. Where

122

folder numbers were unavailable or illegible, linkage was attempted using combinations of other

123

patient identifiers such as name, surname, civil identifier and date of birth. All patients with

124

evidence of HIV prior to PoCT were termed “cascade known HIV-positive”. Retesting was determined

125

using self-reported HIV status and cascade status. Patients who self-reported a previous positive HIV

126

test result and tested positive again during the pilot PoCT were termed “self-reported retest HIV-

127

positive”. Patients with prior evidence of HIV but self-reported a previous negative or unknown HIV

128

status and had a calculated HIV-positive test outcome were termed “unreported retested HIV-

129

positive”. Patients with no prior evidence of HIV, who had a calculated HIV-positive test outcome

130

were termed “true newly diagnosed HIV-positive”.

131

To assess linkage to care, cohort analyses were conducted for all patients who tested HIV-positive

132

using laboratory and pharmacy indicators of HIV care, including viral load and antiretroviral

133

treatment (ART). ART uptake was calculated for patients who were not immediately initiated on

134

treatment following a positive HIV PoCT result.

135

Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore associations with retesting in patients previously

136

diagnosed with HIV. Variables were selected a priori and included in the model to address the

137

effects of confounding. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of Cape

138

Town Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 198/2018).

139
140

Results
From May 2017 to June 2018, 11 337 HIV counselling and testing forms were captured. Over this

141

period, all digitised HIV PoCT records were linked to the PHDC to determine the contribution of the

142

testing data to earlier ascertainment of HIV status and linkage to care. Table 1 shows the key

143

descriptive characteristics of patients tested during the pilot intervention. Most patients were

144

female (79.3%), with many presenting for antenatal care (39.8%). Only 13.4% of patients reported

145

not having ever tested previously.

Digitisation of records

148
149

During the study period, 11564 PoCT entries were tallied from paper registers as part of routine

150

aggregate reporting over 13 completed months (May 2017 – May 2018). Therefore, 96.0%

151

(11119/11564) of entries in the aggregate dataset were individually digitised as part of this project.

152

Overall, 97.0% of records could be linked to the Patient Master Index. Unlinked records could not be

153

definitively linked to a single patient with the available identifiers.

154
155

Of the 11337 patients, 76.7% (8700) tested HIV negative, with 10.7% (1215) testing positive. The

156

remaining 12.5% (1422) did not have a conclusive PoCT outcome recorded. The overall prevalence of

157

HIV among those attending HTS, was 21.2% (2399), almost half of whom (1132) self-reported a

158

positive HIV status and did not retest.

159

Linkage of the apparent 907 newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients to the HIV cascade indicated that

160

over a third (34.7%; 315) were already known to the cascade as HIV-positive, supporting an

161

established diagnosis of HIV in the past. These 315 patients were therefore retesting following a

162

previous positive test results, having not self-reported a positive HIV status. Of those who retested

163

with reporting their HIV-positive status, 46.7% (147/315) had commenced ART prior to their latest

164

PoCT. Overall, 51.3% (623/1215) of patients who tested HIV-positive on at least one rapid test had

165

previously been diagnosed (Fig 1).

166

Fig 1: HIV positivity and yield by testing and prior testing status

167

Of patients who self-reported a positive HIV status, 88.2% (1316/1492) were already known to the

168

PHDC HIV cascade as HIV-positive. Based on available laboratory and pharmacy evidence, an

169

additional 8.3% (125) entered the HIV cascade after their HIV PoCT during the pilot intervention. The

170

remaining 3.4% (51) did not have any prior or subsequent evidence of HIV and were thus not known

171

to the HIV cascade. Of persons self-reporting a positive HIV status, 24.1% (360/1492) retested (self-

172

reported retest). Fig 2 demonstrates the utility of digitisation and individual data linkage to the HIV

173

cascade compared to information garnered from aggregate systems in isolation. Although 50

174

patients retested HIV negative, having self-reported HIV-positive status, linkage to the HIV cascade

175

shows that 38 of these patients had previous evidence of HIV diagnosis in the HIV cascade.

Apparent bivariate associations of older age and women with retesting in spite of HIV-positive status

180

having been ascertained previously were attenuated through adjusting for the reason for testing. In

181

the adjusted model, reason for attending HTS services was highly associated with retesting (Table 2).

Discussion
This study illustrates the important contribution of HIV PoCT data to earlier digital ascertainment of

198

HIV status and linkage to care. We show that digitisation of PoCT records is feasible, having captured

199

electronically 96.0% of expected records. Linkage of HIV PoCT data using the unique identifier

200

further allows discernment of newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients from those who are retesting.

201

We found that half of patients testing HIV-positive on at least one rapid test were retesting following

202

a previous HIV diagnosis, reducing to a third if excluding those who retested positive in spite of

203

indicating that they already knew they had HIV.

204
205

Completeness of ascertainment and linkage of records
Linkage was close to 100% indicating that most patients who had attended HTS during the pilot were

206

registered with public health care services. The majority of patients who self-reported a positive HIV

207

status were known to the HIV cascade, validating the completeness of the cascade within the PHDC.

208

Since HIV PoCT are not routinely digitised, and hence not part of the electronic PHDC HIV cascade,

209

the 176 patients who self-reported HIV-positive in the pilot but did not appear in the cascade, most

210

likely did not engage in further HIV-specific care following an earlier positive PoCT. Overall, 8.4% of

211

patients who self-reported a positive HIV status only entered the HIV cascade following PoCT during

212

the pilot study, when further HIV-specific management was initiated. This pre-treatment loss to care

213

is well-documented throughout sub-Saharan Africa but notably challenging to quantify in the

214

absence of robust health information systems [3][4].

215

The most recent population-level HIV survey in South Africa showed an HIV prevalence of 12.6%

216

(95% CI 9.7 – 16.1) in the Western Cape province [13]. According to the most recent antenatal HIV

217

prevalence survey, the Western Cape province HIV prevalence was 20.8% [14]. In this study, 10.7%

218

of patients tested HIV-positive on at least one rapid test, although this includes retesting and

219

excludes those who elected not to retest following a self-reported previous HIV-positive result. The

220

overall prevalence of HIV among those presenting for HTS was 21.2%, including those who self-

221

reported a previous positive result. This finding is similar to the overall provincial antenatal HIV

222

prevalence and is expected as antenatal patients comprise a large proportion of the study

223

population.

224
225

Retesting among patients with a previous positive HIV diagnosis but who self-reported a negative or

226

unknown status was an important finding that is not quantifiable in the absence of PoCT digitisation.

227

Paper-based records are limited in revealing this phenomenon due to the movement of patients

228

between different public health facilities. We identified known HIV-positive patients as being a

229

substantial proportion of those testing, and additionally identified a further proportion who were

230

retesting without revealing their HIV status. Half of the patients who knew they had HIV and who

231

retested did not declare a previous HIV-positive result and hence were misclassified as new HIV-

232

positive diagnoses in aggregate data. In practice, all retesting is likely to be misclassified in aggregate

233

data due to challenges in tallying data across multiple columns in paper-based registers. Such

234

misclassification has significant implications for South Africa’s approach to measuring progress

235

towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals [1]. Considerable resources have been committed to expanding

236

HIV testing and counselling programmes to achieve the first 90. Our results suggest a third (34.8%)

237

of HIV-infected patients identified by programmes may already be aware of their status.

238

Furthermore, of these patients, almost a half (46.7%) had evidence of prior ART. Attention thus

239

needs to be directed at retaining such individuals in care and on ART (the second and third 90

Understanding retesting
There is a paucity of literature exploring reasons for retesting after a positive HIV result, particularly

243

among those who are already initiated on ART. Since all pregnant patients are referred to the HIV

244

testing counsellors regardless of HIV or ART status, the opportunity for reaffirmation of diagnosis

245

may have prompted retesting, however further research may be needed to better understand

246

reasons for retesting more broadly.

247

Various factors may be associated with non-disclosure of HIV-positive status to healthcare

248

professionals. Most studies have explored non-disclosure of HIV status to family and friends [15][16].

249

One study indicates that non-disclosure to health professionals is as high as 40% in certain settings

250

[15]. Societal stigma, feelings of embarrassment, and denial may all contribute to non-disclosure and

251

seeking

252

understanding of a diagnosis of HIV. A survey conducted in South Africa, showed that only 91% of

253

patients with a previous HIV test were aware of their results [18]. Whether an awareness of a

254

positive result translates to understanding the diagnosis is not well defined. While there are several

255

studies that demonstrate the link between health literacy and health outcomes, most focus on print

256

literacy [19,20]. In the South African setting, patients may be more reliant on oral literacy which may

257

be limited by language barriers between patients and healthcare professionals, rushed consultations

258

and long waiting times. Prior to implementation of the universal test-and-treat strategy in 2015,

259

patients were not eligible for ART until certain criteria were met. This may have led to false

260

perceptions that patients who tested positive for HIV but were not treated, and remained

261

asymptomatic, did not have the infection. These factors may have resulted in apparent non-

262

disclosure of HIV status and subsequent retesting, although further research is imperative to better

263

understand this phenomenon.

264

Those who were referred for PoCT by healthcare workers in other CHC services were more likely to

265

be retesting than those receiving PoCT as part of antenatal care. Younger patients were more likely

266

to retest than older patients. Reasons for these associations require more detailed analyses with

267

consideration for confounding factors such as educational status, socio-economic status, and family

repeat testing [3,15,17]. Another reason, less explored in the literature, is patient

268

support. Linkage of PoCT results to a consolidated individuated data environment contributes to

269

uncovering such phenomena and the ensuing bias introduced when interpreting HIV testing data.

270
271

Longitudinal analyses of individual patient data can assess implementation of HIV care guidelines, in

272

this case, universal test-and-treat. Of those newly diagnosed with HIV, more than half (58.1%) were

273

initiated on ART at study closure, while only a quarter (25%) initiated ART on the day of testing. Our

274

results indicate that the universal test-and-treat strategy has not been fully implemented. Further

275

research is needed to better understand why 41% of newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients had not

276

initiated ART. Although reasons for non-initiation may not be explicit in data available on the PHDC,

277

alerting systems can be developed to flag patients who have not engaged in appropriate HIV care at

278

future consultations or to find and encourage patients to return to HIV care for further

279

management.

280
281

Limitations
There are various pitfalls of using routine data for monitoring and evaluation [21,22], particularly

282

data accuracy and completeness. Since PoCT data are entered as routine clerical tasks in settings

283

where staff have high patient loads, the risk of inaccuracies is high. The 50 patients who self-

284

reported HIV-positive but retested negative likely represent capturing errors of the result on the HTS

285

form, as three quarters of these patients had evidence of HIV in the cascade. However, further

286

studies are warranted to explore whether these may represent patients who had a previous false

287

positive HIV PoCT. Furthermore, high staff turnover among HIV counsellors and nursing staff may

288

result in inadequately trained staff members conducting tests and completing forms, resulting in

289

erroneous entries and incomplete data. The use of a single rapid test for many retesting HIV-positive

290

patients was most likely for reaffirmation of diagnosis, hence the deviation from the National HIV

291

testing protocol. However, there were patients without prior of evidence of HIV who had a single

292

positive test or results entered in incorrect fields, suggesting training gaps. By uncovering such

293

training gaps, digitisation may prompt targeted training interventions, thereby strengthening clinical

294

governance. Limited staff involvement and understanding of data use may also contribute to de-

295

prioritisation of data capturing in the face of more pressing clinical concerns [22]. The quality of

296

PoCT and the validity of the results may be called to question as facility staff are not laboratory-

297

trained and may not be able to adhere to strict quality control criteria [23]. Since HIV PoCT is the

298

standard of care for HIV diagnosis and referral, digitisation of available results will nonetheless add

299

value to the HIV cascade through earlier ascertainment of HIV status and linkage to care. Predictors

300

for retesting could not be fully evaluated in this study, as variables were limited to routinely

301

captured HTS forms. Data on other confounding factors were thus not collected and adjusted for.

302
303

Conclusions
This study clearly demonstrates the important contribution of digitised PoCT data, within a robust

304

PHDC system, to better evaluate the HIV treatment cascade at both a population and an individual

305

level. Improved estimation of the magnitude of retesting may have substantial implications for

306

assessing interventions to achieve 90-90-90 targets. Considerable resources are channelled into

307

achieving the first 90 through wide-scale HIV testing. However, without quantifying the proportion

308

of HIV-infected patients who are retesting, this target cannot be appropriately evaluated.

309

Furthermore, the findings of this study demonstrate the contribution of PoCT in evaluating the

310

second 90 using routine data within the PHDC, and differentiating those who need linkage to care

311

following a new diagnosis, from those who need retention and re-engagement on ART.

312

While this study evaluated the population-level utility of PoCT, individual utility may also be

313

demonstrated. Health care professional access to PoCT results along with other laboratory data, may

314

enhance clinical consultations by improving efficiency during patient history-taking and avoiding

315

duplication of tests, which are uncomfortable and invasive to patients as well as costly to the health

316

system. Timely access to PoCT data and subsequent care access may provide actionable

317

opportunities to follow-up individual patients who have not linked to care and may enhance

318

operational management by facilitating improved monitoring of testing services. It is recommended
