Abstract
Patients with the ‘aggressive’ form of MS accrue disability at an accelerated rate, typically
reaching EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset. Several clinicodemographic factors
have been associated with aggressive MS, but less research has focused on clinical markers
that are present in the first year of disease. The development of early predictive models of
aggressive MS is essential to optimise treatment in this MS subtype. We evaluated whether
patients who will develop aggressive MS can be identified based on early clinical markers,
and to replicate this analysis in an independent cohort. Patient data were obtained from
MSBase. Inclusion criteria were (a) first recorded disability score (EDSS) within 12 months
of symptom onset, (b) at least 2 recorded EDSS scores, and (c) at least 10 years of
observation time. Patients were classified as having ‘aggressive MS’ if they: (a) reached
EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset, (b) EDSS >=6 was confirmed and sustained
over >=6 months, and (c) EDSS >=6 was sustained until the end of follow-up. Clinical
predictors included patient variables (sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, disease duration at
first visit) and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (count, pyramidal
signs, bowel-bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid
administration, hospitalisation). Predictors were evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging
(BMA). Independent validation was performed using data from the Swedish MS Registry. Of
the 2,403 patients identified, 145 were classified as having aggressive MS (6%). BMA
identified three statistical predictors: age > 35 at symptom onset, EDSS >= 3 in the first year,
and the presence of pyramidal signs in the first year. This model significantly predicted
aggressive MS (AUC = .80, 95% CIs = .75, .84). The presence of all three signs was strongly
predictive, with 32% of such patients meeting aggressive disease criteria. The absence of all
three signs was associated with a 1.4% risk. Of the 556 eligible patients in the Swedish MS
Registry cohort, 34 (6%) met criteria for aggressive MS. The combination of all three signs
was also predictive in this cohort (AUC = .75, 95% CIs = .66, .84). Taken together, these
findings suggest that older age at symptom onset, greater disability during the first year, and
pyramidal signs in the first year are early indicators of aggressive MS.

Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with the accrual of disability,
typically due to incomplete recovery from relapses (Jokubaitis et al., 2016). A subset of patients
accrue disability at an accelerated rate. While the rate of disability accrual in MS can represents
a continuum, the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS recognises that the
rapidly progressing phenotype warrants a distinct clinical definition (European Committee for
Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, 2018). An early attempt to define this group of
patients was ‘malignant MS’, which was defined as “disease with a rapid progressive course,
leading to significant disability in multiple neurologic systems or death in a relatively short
time after disease onset” (Lublin and Reingold, 1996). It is estimated that malignant MS
describes approximately 5-10% of patients (Gholipour et al., 2011).
More recently, the term ‘aggressive MS’ has gained increased acceptance (Gholipour et al.,
2011). There is, however, no universally accepted definition of aggressive MS and a number
of different criteria have been used. For example, in terms of the rate of disability accrual, Rush
and colleagues suggest that reaching an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) of 4 within 5
years of symptom onset is a core feature of the phenotype (Rush et al., 2015). Some researchers
used more severe criteria, requiring an EDSS of 6 or greater within 5 years (Menon et al.,
2017), while others have required a gain of 2 or more EDSS points over a two year period
(Scott et al., 2013). The diverse definitions used to describe this phenotype render
interpretation of the literature challenging.
The determinants and clinical predictors of aggressive MS are not well understood; however a
number of risk factors of more rapid disability accrual have been identified (see Rush et al
(2015) for a recent review). Patient characteristics, such as being older at symptom onset or of
male sex, have been recognised (Kantarci et al., 1998; Held et al., 2005; Tremlett et al., 2006;
Ribbons et al., 2015). Several relapse characteristics have also been implicated, including: the
presence of multifocal relapses (Kraft et al., 1981; Wolfson and Confavreux, 1987; Amato et
al., 1999; Bergamaschi et al., 2001); partial or incomplete recovery from relapse; (Trojano et
al., 1995; Scott and Schramke, 2010); greater frequency of relapses (Weinshenker et al., 1989;
Confavreux et al., 2003; Ebers, 2005); and reduced time between relapses (Weinshenker et al.,
1989; Trojano et al., 1995). Relapses associated with motor, cerebellar, bowel/balder, and
cognitive signs have also been implicated (Citterio et al., 1989; Weinshenker et al., 1989;
Phadke, 1990; Runmarker and Andersen, 1993; Weinshenker et al., 1996; Amato et al., 1999;
Zarei et al., 2003; Langer-Gould et al., 2006; Kalincik, 2015). Neuroimaging signs have also
been investigated, and the presence of high T2 lesion burden (Filippi et al., 1994; O'riordan et

al., 1998; Brex et al., 2002; Rudick et al., 2006; Uher et al., 2017); multiple gadoliniumenhancing lesions (Kappos et al., 1999; Rudick et al., 2006); T1 lesions (Tomassini et al.,
2006); early atrophy (Kornek and Lassmann, 2003; Lukas et al., 2010; Vaneckova et al., 2012);
and infratentorial lesions (Sailer et al., 1999) have been shown to raise the risk of more rapid
disability accrual.
While a number of risk factors have been described, the early clinical identification of patients
at risk of aggressive MS presents a significant gap in current understanding. There is a paucity
of large-scale observational studies that have interrogated multiple markers of aggressive MS
simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge none have been conducted with the specific aim
of clinical prediction and risk stratification. Critically, new evidence has demonstrated that
early second-line therapy markedly improves disability outcomes over the long-term
(Vaneckova et al., 2012; Fernández, 2017). However, identification of high-risk patients who
are most likely to benefit from proactive treatment strategies remains an unmet need. The aim
of this study was to define early clinical markers that identify patients who will later meet
criteria for aggressive MS. To maximise clinical translation, we focused on markers are
accessible to clinicians within the first 12 months following symptom onset. We focussed on
estimating the risk of aggressive disease in individual patients and have conducted a validation
in an independent cohort.

Methods
Participants
For the primary analysis, patient data were obtained from the international MSBase cohort
study (WHO ICTRP ID: ACTRN12605000455662) (Butzkueven et al., 2006). The study was
approved by the Melbourne Health Research Ethics Committee and site-specific ethics
committees where relevant. All participants provided informed consent. Data from 58,589
patients attending 139 clinical centres in 34 countries were extracted from the MSBase registry
in March 2018. Inclusion criteria were: (a) a diagnosis of clinically definite relapse-onset
MS(Polman et al., 2011) (b) age at onset >= 18 years, (c) first expanded disability status score
(EDSS) recorded within 12 months of symptom onset, (d) at least 2 recorded EDSS scores
within 10 years of symptom onset, and (e) at least 10 years of observation time. All data were
entered into the iMed patient record system or the MSBase online system as part of routine

clinical practice. Data quality assurance procedures were performed as described elsewhere
(Kalincik et al., 2017).
A second cohort of patients from the Swedish MS Registry (Hillert and Stawiarz, 2015) was
used as an independent validation sample. Data from 19,520 patients were extracted from the
registry in April 2018. The same inclusion criteria were applied as described above.
Definition of aggressive MS
Patients were classified as having aggressive MS if they: (a) reached EDSS >= 6 within 10
years of symptom onset, (b) EDSS >=6 was confirmed and sustained over >=6 months, and (c)
EDSS >=6 was sustained until the end of follow-up (>=10 years).
Early clinical markers
Based on a survey of the relevant literature described above, a set of clinically translatable
predictor variables was chosen. Patient characteristics included sex and age at symptom onset.
The following predictors were included based on observation over the first 12 months
following symptom onset: median EDSS, number of relapses, number of severe relapses
(relapses that significantly affected activities of daily living or required hospitalisation),
administration of steroids, hospitalisation (both used as a proxy for severe relapses), incomplete
recovery after a relapse, pyramidal signs, bowel-bladder signs, cognitive signs, and cerebellar
signs. The following nuisance variables were included: disease duration at first visit (maximum
of 365 days), total observation time (minimum of 10 years), proportion of time spent on firstline (glatiramer acetate, interferon, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide) or second-line
(mitoxantrone, natalizumab, cladribine, fingolimod, alemtuzumab, autologous stem cell
transplantation, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab, siponimod) therapy
(Tramacere et al., 2015) over the first year since symptom onset, and proportion of time spent
on first and second line therapy over the first 10 years since symptom onset. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the first year since symptom onset (presence of
gadolinium enhancing, infratentorial, juxtatentorial, or periventricular lesions) and oligoclonal
band results (positive or negative) were available for a subset of patients.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in R (Version 3.4.4) (R Core Team, 2019). Generalised
linear models (GLMs) were used to determine the statistical predictors of aggressive disease
status. Aggressive disease was entered as the binary dependent variable and a binomial

response distribution with logistic link function was chosen. The following baseline variables
were entered as predictors: gender, age at symptom onset. The following events within the first
year of symptom onset were also entered: median EDSS, any hospitalisation associated with a
relapse, any treatment with steroids, number of severe relapses, number of any relapses,
pyramidal signs, bowel/bladder signs, cerebellar signs, partial recovery from a relapse. The
following nuisance variables were also entered: disease duration at first visit, disease duration
at last visit (total observation time), proportion of time over the first year on first or secondline therapy, proportion of time over the 10-year observation period on first or second-line
therapy.
The use of these 17 predictors of interest resulted in 217 = 131,072 possible statistical models
(i.e., different combinations of predictors). The selection of variables represents a well
understood source of bias and it is difficult to know whether a particular set of predictors
represents the ‘true’ model (Miller, 2002; Lukacs et al., 2010). We used a Bayesian model
averaging (BMA) to address this issue (Raftery et al., 1997). Briefly, for p predictors BMA
estimates all possible models corresponding to the 2p possible combinations of predictors. The
fit of each model was then evaluated using the log of the posterior odds. Parameter estimates
were averaged over all models, weighted for the fit of each model, which inherently adjusted
for the uncertainty associated with model selection bias.
The importance of each predictor was evaluated by the posterior inclusion probability (PIP)
value, which was the probability that the parameter is not zero given the data. More formally,
this is given as 𝑃(𝐵 ≠ 0|𝐷) where B is the parameter estimate for the predictor and D are the
data. This value was computed from the posterior distribution of B, which is given as:
,

𝑃(𝐵 ≠ 0|𝑌) = + 𝑃 (𝐵|𝑀, , 𝐷) 𝑃(𝑀, |𝐷)
,-.

Where B is the parameter estimate for the predictor, D are the data, and M1 to Mk are the models
considered. This therefore represented the average of the posterior distribution for each
parameter averaged over all models and weighted by the posterior probability (Hoeting et al.,
1999). Predictors with PIP values > .5 were considered ‘important’. Predictions of aggressive
disease status for each patient were computed using the posterior predictive distribution
averaged across all models. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, Bayesian
generalised linear mixed models were computed to investigate the importance of modelling a

random intercept across clinical sites. Second, all BMA analyses were repeated using a
subgroup of patients who had an EDSS < 6 at first visit.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were then computed for the combined model,
the ‘reduced’ model containing important predictors only (also known as the median
probability model), and for each of the important continuous predictors separately. The optimal
cut-off probability was determined using Youden’s method (Youden, 1950). Key analyses were
repeated using conventional frequentist generalised linear models, which were estimated using
iteratively reweighted least squares. Robust standard errors were computed via
heteroskedasticity-consistent sandwich estimation. Confidence intervals were computed based
on these standard errors and are presented at the 95% level. Robust p values were also
computed, with the critical α set at .05.
BMA was performed using the Bayesian adaptive sampling package (Clyde et al., 2011). The
intercept was included in all models. The robust mixture of g-priors defined by Bayarri and
colleagues (2012) was placed on each model coefficient. A beta-binomial prior was placed on
each model with parameters α = 1 and β = 1. Bayesian adaptive sampling without replacement
was used with uniform sampling probabilities specified across all parameters (Clyde et al.,
2011). Bayesian generalised linear mixed models were estimated using the brms package to
evaluate the need for random terms nested within clinical site (Bürkner, 2017, 2018). ROC
curves were computed using the pROC package (Robin et al., 2011). Frequentist robust
standard errors were computed using the sandwich package (Zeileis, 2004, 2006). The best
model identified by BMA was replicated in the Swedish MS Registry cohort. Only the clinical
predictors most strongly supported by the evidence were used for replication, with beta
coefficients taken from the original model (rather than being re-estimated).
Results
Sample characteristics
The included sample comprised 2,403 patients, of whom 145 (6%) met criteria for aggressive
disease. The average time from symptom onset to meeting aggressive disease criteria was 6.05
years (SD = 2.79, range = 0 – 9.89 years). As shown in Table 1, patients with aggressive disease
tended to be older at symptom onset, have higher median EDSS during the first year, and a
greater number of relapses in the first year. At a descriptive level of analysis, they were also

more likely to experience hospitalisation, partial recovery from relapse, cerebellar signs,
bowel/bladder signs, and pyramidal signs within the first year of symptom onset.
Predictors of aggressive disease
BMA revealed several important predictors of aggressive disease. The top 20 models, sorted
by posterior probability, are showing in Figure 1. The posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs)
are shown in Figure 2. The strongest evidence was observed for age at symptom onset and first
year EDSS (PIPs = 1). The presence of pyramidal signs was also strongly supported (PIP =
0.75), as was the proportion of time spent on second-line treatment over 10 years (PIP = 1.00).
As shown in Table 2, the remaining predictors had PIPs < .5. When averaged across the whole
model space, the standardised parameter estimates for age of symptom onset, first year EDSS,
and time spent on second-line therapy were significant independent predictors of aggressive
disease, with their respective confidence intervals not capturing zero. The estimate for
pyramidal signs, however, was less precise and included 0 as a plausible value at the 95% level.
Taken in the context of the PIP value greater than .5, this indicates that this predictor is
important to include in any well-fitting model, but there is considerable uncertainty regarding
the specific magnitude of this relationship.
MRI and OCB
The same Bayesian model averaging approach was repeated in the subgroup of patients with
information about cerebral MRI (n = 359) and CSF oligoclonal bands (n = 1,169) available.
For the MRI data, the presence of gadolinium enhancing, infratentorial, juxtatentorial, or
periventricular lesions were added to the full set of predictors as described above. For the OCB
data, positive OCB status was added to the full set of predictors. All MRI markers had PIPs <
.5 (range .01 – .04) which suggested they were not important predictors in the model. The PIP
for oligoclonal bands positive status was .07, which also indicates that this was not an important
predictor of aggressive disease. Model output for these analyses is included in Appendix A.
Sensitivity analyses and assumption checks
The first sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate whether the clustering of cases
within clinical sites should be explicitly modelled via a random effects analysis. Two Bayesian
generalised linear models were estimated; the first with the intercept fixed across all cases, and
the second with a random intercept for each clinical site. The fit of each model was computed
in the form of the leave-one out information criteria (LOOIC). As described in Appendix B, the
fixed intercept model was a better fit to the data (LOOIC = 922.19) compared to the random

intercept (LOOIC = 923.20). As such, the fixed intercept model, as implemented in the BMA
analysis, was deemed most appropriate for all analyses.
A second sensitivity analysis was performed in the subgroup of patients who had an EDSS < 6
at the time of first visit. As shown in Appendix C, these results largely replicated the findings
of the main analysis. Age at symptom onset (PIP = 1.00), EDSS at first visit (PIP = 1.00), and
the presence of pyramidal signs in the first year (PIP = .74) were all important predictors. The
proportion of time spend on a second-line therapy over the 10-year observation period was also
an important predictor (PIP = .99).
Frequentist analysis
All analyses were repeated using a conventional frequentist approach. As shown in Table 3,
the strongest evidence supported age and symptom onset and first year EDSS as significant
predictors of aggressive MS (p < .001). Relatively weaker evidence was observed for the
presence of pyramidal signs (p = .017). The proportion of time spent on second-line treatment
over 10 years was statistically significance (p < .001). As shown in Appendix C, these findings
were confirmed in the subgroup of patients with EDSS < 6 at first clinical visit.
Individual predictive accuracy
When averaged across the model space using BMA, the overall model was predictive of
aggressive disease status. The area under the curve was .82 [95% CI = .78, .85] for the overall
model, and .80 [95% CI = .75, .84] when using only the three important predictors (reduced
model). Using the optimal cut-off of 0.06, the positive predictive value was 15%, compared to
sample prevalence of aggressive disease of 6%. The negative predictive value was 98%. As
shown in Table 4, ROC curves were also computed for each of the numerical predictors
separately (age at symptom onset and median EDSS during the first year). Optimal thresholds
were also computed, with patients classified as positive for each sign if their value was greater
than the respective threshold (except for pyramidal signs, which were already binary). This
procedure was repeated for a model containing all three of the important predictors identified
above (age at symptom onset, median EDSS during the first year, pyramidal signs).
The number of positive signs was then translated into the probability of developing aggressive
disease. Of the patients with all three signs, 32% had aggressive disease. This was followed by
any two signs (14%), any one sign (5%), and no signs (1%). The specific combinations of
positive signs were also computed. As shown in Table 5, this revealed a more complex pattern

of relationships. For example, being positive for EDSS and pyramidal signs was associated
with slightly lower risk of aggressive disease (11%) compared to being positive for age and
EDSS (21%).
External validity
The performance of the three important predictors was evaluated in an independent sample
obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. The mean age at symptom onset (M = 33.35, SD =
8.85) and median EDSS during the first year (M = 1.51, SD = 1.28) were comparable to the
MSBase cohort. The proportion of patients reported to show motor signs in the first year (n =
95, 17%) was lower than the proportion of MSBase patients with pyramidal signs in the first
year (n = 795, 33%). Of the 556 patients, 34 met criteria for aggressive disease (6%). This
prevalence was comparable to the MSBase cohort. The probability of meeting aggressive
disease criteria was predicted in the Swedish MS Registry using three important predictors
identified in the MSBase cohort only. The area under the curve was .75 [95% CI .66, .84], only
marginally lower than in the MSBase cohort, and within the confidence limits. The ROC is
visualised in Appendix D. Using the optimal cut-off of 0.06 (determined from the primary
analysis in the MSBase cohort), the positive predictive value was 15%, compared to sample
prevalence of 6%. The negative predictive value was 97%.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated a comprehensive set of early predictors of aggressive MS. Using
data from the international MSBase registry (Butzkueven et al., 2006), we identified early and
clinically accessible makers that, if observed in the first year since symptom onset, convey
increased risk of the patient meeting criteria for aggressive disease. Specifically, older age at
symptom onset, greater disability in the first year, and the presence of pyramidal signs are
associated with aggressive MS. Conversely, the absence of these signs conveyed lower
probability of meeting aggressive MS criteria compared to the observed base rate. The
predictive power of the overall model was replicated using an independent cohort of patients
from the Swedish MS registry. The Bayesian analytical approach enabled us to estimate
posterior probabilities of aggressive disease which can be directly applied to individual patients
who have recently presented with symptoms of relapse-onset MS.

Overall, these findings are consistent with a number of previous studies. Several studies have
reported general associations of older age at symptom onset (Confavreux et al., 2003; Held et
al., 2005; Confavreux and Vukusic, 2006), early disability progression (Weinshenker et al.,
1989), and motor signs with accelerated worsening of disability (Weinshenker et al., 1989;
Atkins and Freedman, 2013; Correale et al., 2014). In a number of areas, our results may seem
to diverge from previously reported findings. For example, we did not find evidence for an
independent, unequivocal effect of sex (Kantarci et al., 1998; Tremlett et al., 2006), partial
recovery from relapse (Trojano et al., 1995; Scott and Schramke, 2010), severity of relapse
(Rush et al., 2015), the number of relapses early in the disease course (Weinshenker et al.,
1989; Confavreux et al., 2003; Ebers, 2005), and relapses presenting with cerebellar
(Weinshenker et al., 1989; Phadke, 1990; Amato et al., 1999) or bowel/bladder (Citterio et al.,
1989; Runmarker and Andersen, 1993; Amato et al., 1999; Langer-Gould et al., 2006) signs
on the risk of developing aggressive disease. Due to issues of multi-collinearity, we were
unable to investigate the independent effect of cognitive impairment, which has previously
been suggested to be a poor prognostic sign (Zarei et al., 2003). The main conceptual difference
between the present study and the previously published work is its focus on an objectively
defined aggressive disease form rather than the overall risk of disability worsening used as the
outcome in this study. Therefore, it is not surprising that several markers, which are predictive
of disability worsening in general, are not directly associated with the risk of developing
aggressive disease – a disease form that is at an extreme of the continuum of disease severity.
Identifying patients who are at a high risk of developing an aggressive MS is of high clinical
importance. Previously, we have demonstrated that choice of a second-line therapy, in
particular early in the disease course, has the capacity to prevent or delay development of
secondary progressive MS form (Brown et al., 2019) and mitigate the evolution of neurological
disability (He et al., 2018). An objective guidance for treatment of potentially aggressive
disease at early disease stages in a condition whose management revolves around effective
prevention disability driven by episodes of CNS inflammation, is an area of unmet need. The
Bayesian approach used in this study allows us not only to quantify, within a year from disease
onset, the probability of developing significant restriction of gait within 10 years in individual
patients, but also to quantify the uncertainty across competing models – a feature that cannot
be assessed within frequentist frameworks (Raftery et al., 1997). Reassuringly, the direction
and the magnitude of the associations identified within the Bayesian and the frequentist
frameworks are almost identical.

Many of these predictors share a significant proportion of variance. Our statistical approach of
combining all predictors into a single analysis enables us to select only those predictors that
add uniquely to the prediction. This redundancy allows us to focus the resulting predictive
algorithm on a small number of accessible predictors that are able to the essence of the
prediction similarly as the full set of available variables (see Table 4 and Figure 3).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study conducted to identify early clinical
markers of aggressive MS. It enables direct translation of its results into clinical application.
We employed a strict set of inclusion criteria, which required all patients to be observed within
12-months of symptom onset for a minimum of 10 years. This ensured that out control cases
were truly negative in terms of aggressive MS. By requiring patients to meet criteria for
aggressive MS to at least 6 months and until the end of follow-up, we ensured that the risk of
false positives (i.e., patients that met aggressive disease criteria but then reverted to a negative
status) was minimised. Our statistical approach was also a significant strength. Bayesian model
averaging (BMA) has a long history in the statistical literature but has not been applied
extensively in MS research. By averaging the results over all possible models, BMA minimises
model selection bias (Raftery et al., 1997). This approach advances the approaches used
previously to predict the course of disability. In our approach, we have not relied on a single,
arbitrarily selected model, but have reported the result reflects the entire model space and
combines possible statistical models.
External validity of its results is imperative for any predictive algorithm (Copas, 1983; Harrell
et al., 1996) We therefore used an independent, population-based cohort - the Swedish MS
registry, captures approximately 80% of the Swedish MS population - to validate our findings
(Hillert and Stawiarz, 2015). This validation analysis confirmed that the overall model derived
from the BMA analysis provided an accurate prediction in an independent MS cohort, and is
thus generalisable to the prevalent MS population. At the level of the individual predictors
contributing to the model, not all variables could be replicated directly. The definition of
‘motor’ signs in the Swedish MS registry differs from the definition used by MSBase.
Specifically, MSBase uses the pyramidal functional system score based on EDSS( Kurtzke,
1983) while the Swedish MS registry reports motor symptoms as a separate entity. This
difference is further supported by the observation of the relatively lower frequency of motor
signs in the validation cohort compared to pyramidal signs in the discovery cohort. Further
limitations are represented by the relative scarcity of formally reported MRI data and CSF

information. However, we have conducted secondary analyses in subcohorts in whom this
information was available; these analyses did not suggest that qualitatively reported MRI and
CSF oligoclonal bands during the first year contribute meaningfully to the prediction of
aggressive disease. Finally, the data utilised originate from observational registries based on
clinical practice and are subjects to multiple sources of error and confounding. In order to
mitigate these influences, we have applied an objective data quality assessment (Kalincik et
al., 2017) and have constructed large, inclusive multivariable models that have contributed to
the final model through the BMA framework.
In summary, our findings suggest that older age at symptom onset, greater disability in the first
year since symptom onset, and the presence of pyramidal signs indicate a higher risk of
developing aggressive disease. Importantly, the absence of any of these signs is associated with
a much lower risk of aggressive disease compared to the general MS population. For ease of
clinical implementation, these criteria can be defined as: median EDSS ≥ 3, any pyramidal
signs on examination in the first year, and age > 35 at symptom onset. An important direction
for future research will be to determine whether aggressive MS can be prevented by the use of
aggressive treatment strategies in patients who are predicted to develop aggressive disease.

Figures

Figure 1. Visualisation of the model space from the Bayesian model averaging (BMA)
analysis. The top 20 model are shown ranked by the log of the posterior odds. The colour
indicates the posterior probability of the individual predictors (warmer = higher probability).
Black squares indicate that the predictor was not included in the model. As shown, age at onset,
EDSS, and pyramidal signs were consistently included in the best fitting models. The intercept
was included in all models.

Figure 2. Posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP) for each predictor and model parameters
averaged across the model space. EDSS, age at symptom onset, presence of pyramidal signs
during the first year since symptom onset, and time spent on first-line therapy over 10 years
were important predictors (PIPs > .5). All of these predictors were included in the single best
fitting model. The evidence was not compelling for the other predictors.

Appendix B – Investigation of fixed versus random effects models
Two models were computed to investigate whether the random effect of clinical site should be
included in the final model. The first model was computed with a fixed effect for site. The
second model was computed with a random intercept for site. All models were computed in
brms, a package in the R environment. Parameters were estimated using the stan sampler with
3 chains and 2,000 samples (1,000 warmup and 1,000 actual samples). Chains and relevant
metrics were inspected to ensure convergence. The same predictors were used as described in
the main text. Student’s t priors were used for the beta and SD coefficients (location = 0,
degrees of freedom = 3, scale = 2.5). A Student’s t prior was also placed on the intercept
(location = 0, degrees of freedom = 3, scale = 10).
Model fit was assessed using leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation based on the posterior
likelihood. Lower values of the LOO information criteria (LOOIC) indicate better fit. LOOICs
for each model are in Table S2 below.

Random intercept – fixed intercept

As shown in Table S2, there was no meaningful difference between the two models. Taken
together, these results do not support the added utility of including a random intercept in the
model. As such, fixed intercept models were used for subsequent analyses.
