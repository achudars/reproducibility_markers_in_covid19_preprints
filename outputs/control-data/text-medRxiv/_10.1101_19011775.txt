Abstract
To determine the feasibility of complex home-based phenotyping, 1,876 research participants from
the customer base of 23andMe participated in an online version of a Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire
(PSQ) as well as a cold pressor test (CPT) which is used in clinical assessments of pain. Overall our
online version of the PSQ performed similarly to the original pen-and-paper version. Construct validity
of the PSQ total was demonstrated by internal consistency and consistent discrimination between more
and less painful items. Criterion validity was demonstrated by correlation with pain sensitivity as
measured by the cold pressor test. Within the same cohort we performed a cold pressor test using a
layperson description and household equipment. Comparison with published reports from controlled
studies revealed similar distributions of cold pain tolerance times (i.e., time elapsed before removing
the hand from the water). Of those who elected to participate in the CPT, a large majority of
participants did not report issues with the test procedure or noncompliance to the instructions (97%).
We confirmed a large sex difference in CPT thresholds in line with published data, such that women
removed their hands from the water at a median of 54.2 seconds, with men lasting for a median time of
82.7 seconds (Kruskal-Wallis statistic, p < 0.0001), but other factors like age or current pain treatment
were at most weakly associated, and inconsistently between men and women. We introduce a new
paradigm for performing pain testing, called testing@home, that, in the case of cold nociception,
showed comparable results to studies conducted under controlled conditions and supervision of a health
care professional.

Summary
Research paradigms employing home-based phenotyping are feasible, with both questionnaires and
self-administration of a well-established experimental human pain model yielding similar results

compared to controlled settings.

Introduction
Drug development in pain indications has a higher-than-average attrition rate. One possible way to
increase success is to identify promising targets based on genetic links between target and disease 13.
However, discovering new genetic links to pain requires large cohorts

26

, which may be difficult to

obtain in using phenotypes obtained under controlled settings (e.g. clinical trials). In order to enable
collection of larger samples, we investigated pain phenotyping in a large cohort of subjects using an
internet and home-based approach.
Deep pain phenotyping of subjects is a key prerequisite to identify subgroups for a pain indication.
In a laboratory quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol, subjects may be exposed to multiple types
of pain stimulus (heat, cold, pressure, etc.). Here we present the results from 1,876 participants asked
to perform the cold pressor test (CPT) on themselves at home, via a layperson description, using
household equipment, and guided by a web-based workflow. In addition to the CPT, participants selfadministered an online version of the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) and reported about their
history of treatment for pain.
It is well established that individuals experience pain differently 2,5. A similar sensory input caused
by experimental or clinical pain can lead to vastly differing ratings of the pain experience by different
subjects, and it is most likely that this is caused by individual differences in both peripheral and central
processing of that sensory input. This has significant implications for patients and clinicians who may
struggle to establish a treatment that is effective in reducing pain experience (as indicated by pain
ratings), but also for drug development where the differences described above introduce another layer
of variability, making it more difficult to identify true drug effects. Although the interindividual
differences in pain processing are well known, there is only limited data available describing this

variability in larger populations.
The CPT was developed to measure autonomous responses in the cardiovascular system 7. The test
usually consists of immersion of one hand in ice water for a specified amount of time 12, which induces
both pain and a response of the autonomous nervous system. The CPT has been widely adopted as a
model for nociceptive pain, and for opioids it is established as a surrogate of clinical efficacy 19. As
such, this test has been used mostly in small populations from clinical trials with two notable
exceptions: cohorts from Haifa, Israel,
summarized by Treister et al.

14,15,23

and unpublished data, and Tromsø, Norway 8, both

22

. The studies conducted in Haifa included 648 people. The Tromsø

Study included 10,486 people enriched for those 40-42 or 60-87 years old. That study found much
lower pain sensitivity than seen in the participants from Haifa, in that most participants left their hands
in the cold water for longer than 100 seconds. However, they found that large group of participants
with chronic pain removed their hands from the water sooner, indicating lower pain tolerance.
The PSQ consists of 14 imagined painful situations and 3 non-painful control situations, and
subjects are asked to rate their painfulness on a 0-10 numeric rating scale, originally in German

16

.

Ruscheweyh et al. showed that the PSQ demonstrated strong internal consistency, demonstrated by
high Cronbach’s α of both the PSQ-total score and two derived sub-factors labeled as sensitivity to
“minor” and “moderate” pain. Moreover, they reported evidence of criterion validity demonstrated by
correlation with subjective pain experienced from a range of stimuli, including pinprick, pressure,
phasic and tonic heat and cold, and the cold pressor test. However, PSQ-total score did not correlate
with response thresholds to any stimulus, including time to withdraw one’s hand from cold water in the
CPT. A validation in chronic pain patients 16, and a separate English language validation of the PSQ 18
have been published . However, the number of subjects from which PSQ data are published is limited
(406 subjects in 16, 319 subjects in 17, 136 subjects in 18).
Pain sensitivity measured via the PSQ may be associated with a history of chronic pain. In a second

study, Ruscheweyh et al. reported significantly elevated PSQ scores in 134 chronic pain patients as
compared to 185 healthy controls. A subgroup of 46 chronic pain patients were given experimental pain
testing, not including the CPT but including pain ratings, but not thresholds, from another tonic cold
stimulus. In that subgroup, there was a strong correlation between PSQ and tonic cold stimulus pain
rating 17.

self-administration allow for large studies to be conduct more quickly and at less expense. Here, we
investigate whether online, self-administered versions of the PSQ and CPT demonstrate similar
construct and criterion validity as observed in both pen-and-paper and laboratory protocols.

Methods
Tools/measures - Web-based phenotyping
23andMe is a direct to consumer personal genomics company with a research platform that allows
participants to complete questionnaires for research purposes. We added online versions CPT consent
and instructions, and questionnaires, to the research area of the 23andMe Personal Genetics Service
website (www.23andme.com). Ultimately, 1,876 participants who were at least 20 years old, and
consented to participate in the research, completed the questionnaires followed by the CPT. In addition
to the PSQ questionnaire, we asked about history of diagnosis with, and treatment for, acute and
chronic pain-related conditions. As our pain history questionnaire was unexpectedly long for many
participants, the 1,876 participants who completed the activities reflect substantial attrition from the
approximately 10,000 who started the sequence.
Subjects
We recruited participants for both the questionnaires and CPT using email and by participation of
research participants on the 23andMe website in the US . Participants provided informed consent
online according to a protocol approved by Ethical & Independent Review Services, a private
institutional review board (OHRP/FDA registration number IRB00007807, study number 10044-11),
which included separate consent for the CPT. Participants with pain conditions were eligible for this
study, though they were excluded from the original validation study of the PSQ by Ruscheweyh et al.
16

. Exclusions for participation are described in Table 1. Participants with self-reported cardiovascular

disorders (e.g. high blood pressure, heat diseases, dysrhythmia), a history of Raynaud’s phenomenon,
any neurological disorders, and/or pregnancy were not recruited and advised not to participate (Table 1)
to minimize the risk of adverse events during the CPT procedure. Especially because no researcher was
present in this at-home testing who could provide assistance in such cases we used this as an additional
safety precaution. This resulted in the exclusion of participants with some chronic pain conditions, like

migraine, but not others, like back pain. Ultimately, of the 1,876 participants, 181 (11.2%) reported
being treated in the past 4 months with prescription medication for an acute pain condition and another
78 (4.2%) for a chronic pain condition. Those treated for both chronic and acute pain conditions were
classified as having acute pain.
Differences to supervised CPT
In contrast to a controlled clinical or laboratory setting, in our study the CPT was done by the
participants themselves at home using a lay description of the procedure (Figure 1). Two primary
outcomes were assessed: cold pain threshold and cold pain tolerance. Cold pain threshold was the time
to the first report of pain and cold tolerance the tome time to removal of the hand from the water. We
additionally asked about maximum pain intensity, but our measure of pain intensity differs from some
other laboratory protocols. First, we presented an 11-point visual analog scale immediately after the
completion of the task, rather than periodically during the task itself. This was required to minimize the
number of simultaneous tasks for participants to perform. Second, we only asked about the maximum
pain felt at the end of the test. While at least one large study has measure pain intensity in a similar way
14,15

, others score periodic measurements by averaging over all pain intensity measurements and

imputing the maximum score 10, for any intervals following the removal of the hand 8. Studies may
also use both methods 1.
We analyzed the PSQ by calculating the PSQ total score and by factor analysis. In addition to
comparing derived factors with published reports, we assessed the extent to which each participant’s
rating correlated with the factor loadings, reflecting the extent to which they rated experiences more
indicative of pain sensitivity more highly than ones less indicative, regardless of the average level of
painfulness report. Finally, we compared PSQ scores with CPT thresholds and pain intensity ratings.

Questionnaires
In a sequence of two questionnaires, the first included the English-language version of the PSQ
and additional questions about the participant’s own memory of painful experiences. The second
questionnaire included questions about history of pain conditions and related medications.
Causes of chronic pain included self-reported low back pain; complex regional pain syndrome;
joint pain; diabetic neuropathy; endometriosis; cancer; other internal pain not caused by endometriosis
or cancer; shingles, cold sores, or herpes; trigeminal neuralgia; migraine; non-migraine headaches that
occurred more than half of the days in any given month; pain following amputation; or other pain after
injury or surgery that lasted more than 3 months. Acute pain included dental pain, pain after injury or
surgery that lasted less than 3 months, or other pain that lasted less than 3 months. Participants were
classified as having current acute pain if they had been treated with a prescription pain medication for
an acute condition in past 4 months. Participants without current acute pain were classified as having
current chronic pain if they had been treated with a prescription pain medication for a chronic condition
in the past 4 months. Otherwise, they were classified with no current pain condition.
Cold pressor test
Participants with a history of migraine and a number of other chronic conditions that might be
directly exacerbated by the activity were not invited to participate in the CPT in order to ensure their
safety, while participants with other chronic pain conditions, including chronic back pain, were invited.
Moreover, participants reporting neurological or temperature-triggered conditions (e.g. migraine,
history of syncope, or Raynaud’s phenomenon) or current injuries to their non-dominant hands at the
time of recruitment were ineligible to review the supplementary CPT consent document and to
participate. Participants were asked to prepare their own bath of ice water at home, and to keep their
non-dominant hand submerged to the wrist for no more than 150 seconds. The amount of ice in the
instructions (1/8 of the container size) would not fully melt at ambient water and air temperatures, and

would remain floating at the top of the water. However, if participants did not add enough ice or added
warm water and the ice did melt, temperatures would have risen from about 0° at the beginning to a
higher temperature at the end of the test. This differs from many laboratory protocols in which
refrigeration and water circulation are used to keep the temperature at 2-5° for the duration of the test.
Data analysis
To test the psychometric validity of the online English-language PSQ

18

, we compared

psychometric properties with those of the original validation of the German-language version of the
PSQ 16. We computed the same measures as described in the original study of the German language
version: PSQ-total (all items considered painful), PSQ-minor (the least painful items: 14, 3, 6, 12, 11,
10, and 7, ordered from least to most painful), PSQ-moderate (8, 15, 2, 16, 17, 1, 4 ordered from least
to most painful), and calculated Cronbach’s α for each measure, a measure of internal consistency.
To further assess construct validity, we conducted factor analysis of the PSQ items. Factor analysis
of the PSQ items by Ruscheweyh et al.

16

yielded two factors corresponding to minor and moderate

causes of pain. On the basis of this result, they proposed a PSQ-total score (the mean of all painful
items) and PSQ-minor and PSQ-moderate subscales (the means of the respective items). Our
comparisons with Ruscheweyh et al.

16

include those between (1) item-level means scores, (2) mean

scores for the PSQ-total and subscales, (3) varimax factor loading, (4) item correlations with PSQ-total,
(5) correlation of CPT pain threshold, tolerance, and intensity with PSQ-total to assess criterion validity
of both the PSQ and CPT. We also compare the distribution of CPT pain thresholds with those found in
previous studies, including Ruscheweyh et al. 16. Following the recommendation of Treister et al. 22, we
used the Kruskal-Wallis rank test to examine differences between, sex, age, and pain history group in
CPT thresholds and pain intensity.
In addition to these validation steps, we also investigated whether participants varied in the
accuracy. We defined accuracy as the within-person correlation of PSQ pain ratings with the loadings

on the first principal component. Those who rated the items that were generally considered more
painful as more painful, or vice-versa, would have high accuracy scores.

Results
Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire
Internal consistencies (Cronbach's α) were similar to Ruscheweyh et al. 16 for PSQ total (ours 0.93,
theirs 0.92), PSQ minor (ours 0.84, theirs 0.81), and PSQ moderate (ours 0.90, theirs 0.91). Table 2
gives mean scores for the whole group as well as scores stratified by sex, age, and pain history. Items
for the PSQ-moderate (1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 16, and 17) were each rated as more painful than items for the
PSQ-minor (3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 14) in both the present study and Ruscheweyh et al. 16 (see Table 3
and 4). Three items (5, 9, 13) that describe normally non-painful situations have been excluded.
While we found only one principal component with an eigenvalue over 1, the second was close to 1
(7.25 and 0.97), so we compared with the two-factor solution presented by Ruscheweyh et al. 16. These
two components explain about 59% of the total variance, compared to 55% in Ruscheweyh et al.

16

.

Varimax rotation results in two factors with a similar structure to that observed by Ruscheweyh et al. 16,
as shown in Table 3, but with several notable differences. Our Factor 1 loads mostly minor causes of
pain, similar to Factor 2 in Ruscheweyh et al.

16

and our Factor 2 loads more moderate causes of pain.

The biggest difference is seen for item 3 (“Imagine your muscles are slightly sore as the result of
physical activity”), which loaded on the minor pain factor in Ruscheweyh et al.

16

, but more heavily

load on the moderate pain factor in our results, despite being rated as less painful. Conversely, items 15
(“Imagine you pick up a hot pot by inadvertently grabbing its equally hot handles”) and 16 (“Imagine
you wear sandals and someone with heavy boots steps on your foot”) more heavily loaded the moderate
pain factor in Ruscheweyh et al. 16, but more heavily load the minor pain factor in our results, despite
being rated as relatively painful.

Items correlated similarly with the PSQ total score in the two studies (correlation of correlations =
0.92, see Table 3). Pain attributed to a strong handshake (#14) was the weakest correlate of total PSQ
score in both studies, and, as a non-painful item, is also not a component of the PSQ scores. The three
strongest correlates with PSQ total score in both studies were pain attributed to hitting one's “funny
bone” (#17), to having one's foot stepped on (#16), and to biting one's cheek (#8).
Cold pressor test
Cold pain tolerance distribution is presented in Figure 2. This figure also shows results from two
other large cohorts (data from

22

), obtained in a controlled laboratory setting with a standard

methodology (e.g. use of a circulating, refrigerated water bath kept at a constant temperature).
CPT tolerance time distributions differed substantially by sex (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 71,
p<0.0001, Figure 4), but not by age (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 13, p=0.0241, Figure 5) or pain history
(Kruskal-Wallis statistics = 4, p=0.1591, Figure 6). Women report a median tolerance of 54.2 seconds
(IQR 30.4 – 116.5), which was 31.0 seconds earlier than the median of 82.7 seconds (IQR 43.6 –
150.0) reported by men.
PSQ total score was somewhat less correlated with retrospective pain intensity rating just after the
CPT (r = 0.30 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.34], Spearman rho = 0.30) than found by Ruscheweyh et al.

16

who

asked about pain intensity during the task (r = 0.56), but more similar to the correlation found in the
validation of the Norwegian-language PSQ (r = 0.36).

25

Conversely, Ruscheweyh et al.

16

found no

significant correlation of PSQ total with CPT pain threshold (r = 0.03, p = 0.86, n = 47), whereas we
found small but significant correlations with both time to the first report of pain in the CPT (r = -0.14 [0.19, -0.09], Spearman rho = -0.15) and time to withdrawal of the hand, or “tolerance”, (r = -0.22 [0.27, -0.17], Spearman rho = -0.22). Ruscheweyh et al. 16 found no significant correlation of PSQ total
with CPT pain threshold (r = 0.03, p = 0.86, n = 47), whereas the validation of the Norwegian-language
PSQ 25 found a somewhat stronger correlation (r = -0.30, p<0.05, n=48).

469 participants (25%) reported maximum, retrospective pain intensities during the CPT below 3
on a scale of 0-10, where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.

While we

hypothesized that these participants might have prepared the CPT test incorrectly, they also reported
lower PSQ total score (mean 2.55, SD 1.19 among those with CPT pain rating <= 3.0, mean 3.29, SD
1.35 among those with pain rating > 3.0, t=11.3, df=900.5, p<0.0001). Removing these participants
from the analysis did not substantially change associations between the CPT and PSQ total score. The
largest change after removal of these participants was a decrease in the correlation between CPT pain
threshold and PSQ total score (from r = -0.14 [-0.19, -0.09] to r = -0.10 [-0.15, -0.05]).
Accuracy
The 14 painful items of the PSQ can be ordered and weighted according to their painfulness. We
therefore analyzed how accurately participants were to assign pain scores to the individual items.
Within-person correlations between PSQ item ratings and loadings on the first principal component had
a median of 0.62 (IQR: 0.31 - 0.81), with a long-left tail stretching into negative correlations. Accuracy
scores showed small but significant correlations with both PSQ-total score (Spearman r = 0.14,
p<0.0001) and CPT tolerance (Spearman r = -0.08, p=0.0002), suggesting that pain sensitivity and
accuracy of pain rating related.

Discussion
We measured pain sensitivity in a large population and an uncontrolled setting, where subjects
answered the PSQ and performed a CPT at home. A limitation of the study is that we did not directly
compare the results of self-administration of the CPT to results from a laboratory test within the same
cohort. Instead, we compared the results of self-administration, in aggregate, to results reported in
laboratory tests. For the critical measures of pain sensitivity, including cold pressor test tolerance, our
results are similar to results obtained in controlled laboratory settings. Because of self-administration at
home we had to adapt precise CPT protocol descriptions like temperature to simpler terms like room
temperature. This also includes the amount of ice, which we described by 1/8th of the water volume.
Overall, this likely lead to considerable variability in the actual stimulus that was received by each
participant but allowed us to conduct a web-based instruction workflow to self-administer a CPT in the
absence of trained staff.
The online PSQ performed similarly to the original German-language version and sample, and to
other versions and sample. The average PSQ-total score that we observed (3.3) was somewhat lower
than that measured in small studies of several translation and in samples with and without chronic pain
conditions

3,9,17,18

, but a population study of 4,979 German-speaking Italians

10

also observed and

average pain score of 3.3.
While we find strong psychometric support for the PSQ-total score, we show only weak replication
of distinct minor and moderate PSQ scales, relative to a single PSQ scale. In this study, we see stronger
overall evidence for a one-factor than a two-factor solution of the PSQ, consistent with results from the
large study of the German-speaking Italians 10. The PSQ factor structure that we observed was similar
to that seen for the Polish and French-language versions of the PSQ, which showed weak distinction
between the minor and moderate pain factors, particularly for questions 3, 6, 7, 8, 16, and 17

Polish-language version was validated in a sample of 161 lower back pain patients, and the Frenchlanguage version in two samples, one of 146 pre-surgical patients and the other of 85 health controls.
The factor structure for the English-language PSQ has not been reported previously 18.
Among the participants who completed both the PSQ and an online self-administration of the CPT,
the distribution of CPT scores was largely within the rather broad range of those found in laboratory
studies, with the exception of more frequent intermodal thresholds in the online cohort. Whereas
Ruscheweyh et al.

16

found no significant association between PSQ and CPT thresholds, we found

small but significant negative correlations between PSQ score and both time to report of pain and to
removal of the hand. The original validation study may have been underpowered to detect these
associations. Power to detect the correlation of 0.22 in a sample of 47 is only 32%. Alternatively,
participants who report lower pain sensitivity might over-report their pain threshold in the online
design, but not in a laboratory design. Future studies should directly compare CPT performance in
laboratory and self-administered settings.
These results support the notion that, when properly instructed, subjects are capable of selfadministering the CPT in the absence of trained staff providing individual instructions. While variation
in the how participants prepare the test apparatus, for example, the temperature of the water 11, certainly
affect the reported pain thresholds, our results suggest that these errors will not yield false-positive
associations with factors of interest to researchers. In fact, earlier studies have already shown that webbased phenotyping can produce a phenotype similar enough to physician-obtained phenotypes to yield
similar results in genome-wide association studies 24. Our study adds to this in showing that web-based,
self-phenotyping appears to be a valid approach not only when considering questionnaires, but that
some test procedures can be followed to yield results similar to results from laboratory settings. Since
we are using a web-based approach we do not have a familiarization session at the beginning which is
usually done in a supervised laboratory test like QST. Instead we implemented a dry test before the

actual time recordings started so that the participants were prepared to use the web interface and knew
about the upcoming sequential steps.
In addition to supporting the validity of subjective and self-administered measures of pain
sensitivity, our results also suggest that individuals differ in their ability to precisely and accurately rate
pain, the latter measured by consistency with the observed factor structure, which aligns with other
recent research

20,21

. However, apparent differences might also be explained by, for example,

differences in general attentiveness or conscientiousness, rather than pain rating ability as such.
Accuracy scores had a long-left tail stretching into negative scores (i.e. scoring less painful items as
more painful). Such a left tail is also observed in measures of person fit to item response theory models
of the participant’s knowledge of the correct answers to a set of questions. These have been interpreted
to reflect, for example, lack of attention to the task, rather than lack of ability, which is thought to have
a more symmetric distribution 4. Factors like attentiveness are difficult to assess in a non-supervised
setting like the one used for this study.
The online implementation, and related study design compromises, have several disadvantages. As
we recruited participants via an online platform throughout the United States, it was impractical for us
to repeat the same study with the same cohort under laboratory conditions. Therefore, we could not
directly compare our results within the same cohort under controlled conditions but instead used data
from published cohorts. We anticipate future studies directly comparing online and lab
implementations.
Population-based, multi-omics studies will grow in the future and therefore a deep phenotypic
characterization of datasets is key to deriving maximum amount of insight out of these efforts. Our
approach of at-home testing and questionnaires is a first attempt to fill this gap. An online approach, by
broadening participation in multi-omics studies, might help to further fill the gap of understanding pain
phenotype subgroups, and discovering new pain-related biological pathways.

Upcoming investigations will include the identification of patients whose pain perception is
different from the average, especially those able to discriminate better between more and less painful
stimuli. Furthermore, we will continue to investigate additional pain testing@home possibilities and
will identify pain relevant genes and pathways in order to derive targets using genetic association
studies to relevant pain measures. This may allow us to adjust pain scales to standardize individual
responses and to identify groups of patients for precision medicine approaches.
