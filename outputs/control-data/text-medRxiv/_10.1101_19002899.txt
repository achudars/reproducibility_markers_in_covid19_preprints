Abstract:

52

Objective: Obesity-related decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functions such as

53

cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) has supported the notion that this lipoprotein dysfunction may

54

contribute for atherogenesis among obese patients. Besides, potentially other HDL protective

55

actions may be affected with weight gain and these changes may occur even before the obesity

56

range.

57

Methods: Lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), biochemical measurements, and

58

carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were obtained in this cross-sectional study with 899

59

asymptomatic individuals. HDL functions were measured in a subgroup (n=101).

60

Results: Individuals with increased HDL-C had an attenuated increase in cIMT with

61

elevation of BMI. CEC, HDL-C, HDL size and HDL-antioxidant activity were negatively

62

associated with cIMT. BMI was inversely associated with HDL-mediated inhibition of platelet

63

aggregation and CEC, but surprisingly it was directly associated with the antioxidant activity.

64

Thus, even in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, increased BMI is associated with a wide

65

change in protective functions of HDL, reducing CEC and increasing antioxidant activity. In

66

these subjects, decreased HDL concentration, size or function are related to increased

67

atherosclerotic burden.

68

Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, the

69

increasing values of BMI are associated with impaired protective functions of HDL and

70

concomitant increase in atherosclerotic burden.

1. Introduction

79

Presently, one in three individuals with excess weight will die from cardiovascular

80

disease (CVD)[1, 2]. In fact, both obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) and overweight (BMI of 25 to <30

81

kg/m2) individuals are at increased risk of cardiovascular death as compared with those with

82

BMI within the normal range (18.5 to <25 kg/m2)[3]. The proposed milieu for this interaction

83

involves a spectrum of mechanisms in which phenotypic or functional changes in high-density

84

lipoprotein (HDL) are involved [4].

85

The identification of HDL involvement in adiposopathy is not a recent issue. Since the

86

metabolic syndrome was conceived, all clinical criteria for its diagnosis included low levels of

87

plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) as a marker of metabolically, unhealthy obesity. In the

88

mechanistic point of view, the combination of increased substrate, such as triglyceride-rich

89

lipoproteins, and increased activity of HDL remodeling proteins, such as cholesteryl ester

90

transfer protein (CETP), and hepatic lipase (HL), coexists in overweight individuals as a result

91

of insulin resistance, promoting a reduction in HDL concentration, size and its content of

92

apolipoproteins AI (ApoA-I). In addition, a decrease in the overall cholesterol efflux capacity

93

(CEC) has been reported in obese subjects [5], despite the increased ABCA1-mediated

94

cholesterol efflux[6].

95

Besides CEC, HDL also mediates several other anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms, such

96

as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities and inhibition of platelet aggregation, whose extent

97

is sensitive to phenotypic changes of the particles, such as those described above. If this is so,

98

more than the reduced capacity as free cholesterol acceptor, an overall dysfunction in the HDL

99

system may follow weight gain [7]. Furthermore, as the magnitude of these phenotypic changes

100

in HDL occurs in parallel with the increase in BMI, it is possible that a cluster of particle

101

dysfunctions occurs earlier with the weight gain, possibly even before the criterion for

102

overweight. Hence, a metabolic legacy related to HDL may contribute to the future CVD risk.

103

In order to shed some light on these gaps, we designed this study to evaluate the impact of BMI

on the interaction between HDL concentration and functions with atherosclerotic burden in pre-

105

obese individuals.

106

2. Materials and methods

107

2.1. Cross-sectional study description

108

We evaluated a sample of 899 asymptomatic individuals who were seen in two primary

109

care centers between 2008 and 2013: the outpatient clinic at Dante Pazzanese Institute of

110

Cardiology, São Paulo (SP), Brazil, and governmental primary care centers of the city of

111

Campinas, SP, Brazil. Inclusion criteria were: (1) no manifested atherosclerotic CVD; (2) no

112

diagnosis of type 2 diabetes based on antidiabetic treatment, fast blood glycemia ≥126 mg/dL,

113

glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5% or glycemia ≥200 mg/dL on 120-minutes oral tolerance test and (3)

114

age between 20 and 75 years old. We excluded individuals with (1) uncontrolled hyper (thyroid

115

stimulating hormone (TSH) <0.41μUI/mL or free thyroxin >1.8ng/dL) or hypothyroidism

116

(TSH>4.50μUI/mL or free thyroxin <0.9 ng/dL); (2) antidiabetic medications; (3) liver disease,

117

as indicated by ALT or AST over two times the upper limit; (4) urea >40mg/dL; (5) glomerular

118

filtration rate ≤60 mL/min/1.73m2; (6) heart failure NYHA stage ≥III; (7) HIV positive or (8)

119

withdrawal of informed consent. Patients underwent clinical examination, as well as

120

biochemical analysis. Subclinical atherosclerosis was measured in all patients up to a month

121

after being included. The study was approved by the local institutional ethical committee of the

122

Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia (registration number 3852/2009). It is also registered

123

at ClinicalTrials.Gov by the identification NCT02487615. All patients provided written and

124

informed consent forms before taking part in the study. The study protocol conforms to the

125

ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

126

A sub-analysis testing functions and characteristics of HDL was performed in

127

consecutive sample of 101 individuals from the enrolled participants in the governmental

128

primary care centers of the city of Campinas. The study was approved by the local institutional

129

ethical committee of the Hospital das Clínicas of the State University of Campinas (registration

130

number 1260/2010). It is registered at ClinicalTrials.Gov by the identification NCT02106013.

131

All patients provided written and informed consent forms before taking part in the study. The

132

study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

133

2.2. Biochemical analysis

134

Blood samples were drawn after a 12-hour fasting period. The following biochemical

135

measurements were performed: triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, creatinine, c-reactive

136

protein (CRP), insulin, glucose, and insulin. LDL-C was calculated using Friedewald´s

137

equation. Glomerular filtration rate was calculated by the CKD-EPI equation. HOMA2 % S,

138

HOMA2-IR and HOMA2%β were calculated using computer models [8].

139

2.3. Carotid artery ultrasound

140

Carotid Doppler ultrasound was performed using high-resolution Vivid 7 ultrasound

141

(GE, USA) and high-frequency linear transducer (9 MHz) with automatic border recognizer

142

detection as described previously in Bertolami et al [9]. Briefly, the cIMT was obtained by

143

means of image processing of B-mode ultrasonograms of the right and left automatic

144

measurement. High-resolution B-mode ultra-sonographic imaging was performed initially

145

evaluating the common carotid artery with antero-oblique insonation above the clavicle and

146

alongside the internal carotid artery, as standardized procedure[10]. Measurement of cIMT was

147

obtained 20 mm proximally from the carotid bifurcation as the distance between the lumen–

148

intima interface and the media–adventitia interface[11].

149

2.4. Lipoprotein isolation

150

LDL was isolated from a pool of normolipidemic sera from 20 volunteers, through

151

sequential ultracentrifugation using a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc.,

152

Palo Alto, USA), with a 75Ti fixed angle rotor (Havel, 1955 #11). HDL was isolated from each

153

study participant through density gradient ultracentrifugation[12] with the use of a SW41Ti

154

rotor. Isolated lipoproteins were extensively dialyzed against EDTA-free PBS for 24h, at 4oC, in

155

a dark room. All assays were performed in freshly isolated lipoproteins that were kept at 4oC for

156

a maximum period of 15 days.

157

2.5. HDL chemical composition and molar concentration measurements

158

HDL chemical composition was measured using commercially available enzymatic kits,

159

in the microplate reader Power Wave XS (BioTek®, Winooski, USA). Total proteins (Pierce™

160

BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA), TC (CHOD-PAP, total

161

cholesterol, Roche Diagnostics® reagents, Mannheim, Germany), FC (Free Cholesterol E,

162

Wako Chemicals, Richmond, USA), PL (Phospholipids C, Wako Chemicals, Richmond, USA),

163

TG (TG, GPO-PAP, Roche Diagnostics® reagents, Mannheim, Germany) and ApoA-I (TINA

164

QUANT APOA1 V2, Roche Diagnostics® reagents, Mannheim, Germany) were measured,

165

while CE was calculated according to the following formula: (TC–FC) x 1.67[12]. The relative

166

content of ApoA-I (HDL-ApoA-I) or lipids in HDL was calculated based on their proportion to

167

the total mass of HDL, calculated as the sum of FC, PL, TG, CE, and total proteins. HDL molar

168

concentration was estimated based on particle total mass and molecular weight[12].

169

2.6. HDL physical-chemical characterization

170

HDL particle size was determined using dynamic light scattering, in a Nanotrac Particle

171

Size Analyser 250 (Microtrac Inc., Montgomeryville, USA)[13]. Zeta potential was determined

172

in HDL diluted 1:10 in KCl 10mM, using laser Doppler micro-electrophoresis, in the Zetasizer

173

Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK).

174

2.7. Determination of proteins involved in HDL metabolism

175

CETP and PLTP activities were measured using exogenous radiometric assays, as

176

previously described[14, 15]. LPL and HL activities were measured in fasted post-heparin

177

plasma samples, collected 15min after the intravenous administration of heparin (100U/kg body

178

weight), in an assay based on fatty acid release from a radiolabeled triolein emulsion[16]. LCAT

179

activity was determined using recombinant HDL, according to standardized method [17]. PON

180

activity was measured using paraoxon (diethyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate, Sigma, St. Louis, MO,

181

USA) as substrate [18].

182

2.8. HDL antioxidant activity

183

HDL antioxidant activity was measured in a kinetic fluorimetric assay adapted from

184

Navab et al[19]. Oxidation was monitored as changes in the fluorescence intensity of 2',7'-

185

dichlorofluoresceine (DCFH). For the antioxidant activity assays, LDL (final concentration,

186

20mgTC/dL) and CuSO4 (final concentration, 0.5μM) were added to DCFH-containing tubes

187

(final concentration, 2mg/mL), followed by the addition or not of HDL (final concentration,

188

15mg total mass/dL). The volume was adjusted to 100µL with Chelex treated-PBS and the

189

reaction mixture transferred onto a black 96-well microplate. The plate was covered with an

190

optical adhesive cover to avoid evaporation and incubated at 37°C. Fluorescence intensity was

191

measured over 24h with 15-minute intervals in a fluorescence microplate reader (Spectra Max

192

M5; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA) at an excitation wavelength of 485nm, emission

193

wavelength of 540 nm, and cut-off of 530nm. Results of antioxidant activity are presented as the

194

percentage of inhibition of LDL oxidation in the presence of each subject’s HDL when

195

compared to control wells (LDL alone).

196

2.9. HDL anti-inflammatory activity

197

HDL’s anti-inflammatory activity was measured in HUVEC in an assay adapted from

198

Besler et al[20]. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum,

199

penicillin, and streptomycin and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37oC. After reaching

200

confluence, they were plated in 24-well culture plate (3 x 105 cells/well, and incubated with

201

TNF-α (1ng/mL), with or without HDL (50μg ApoA-I/mL) for three hours. The culture media

202

were collected and stored at -80oC. Due to the low VCAM-1 concentrations, samples were

203

concentrated using the Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal Filters, 50K (Millipore, Massachusetts,

204

USA) and then VCAM-1 concentrations were measured using the Human VCAM-1 ELISA Kit

205

(Cat number ECM340, Millipore, Massachusetts, USA). Results are expressed as the percentage

206

of decrease in VCAM-1 concentrations in the wells incubated with HDL when compared to the

207

control wells without HDL.

208

2.10. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) assay

209

Global cellular CEC was performed using J774 macrophages enriched with acetylated
14

210

LDL and

211

macrophages were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin,

212

and streptomycin and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. After reaching confluence,

213

cells were plated in a 96-well plate (1.25 x 105 cells/well, and enriched with acetylated LDL (50

C-cholesterol and HDL as the cholesterol acceptor[21]. In summary, J774

μg/mL) and

215

containing fatty acid-free albumin (FAFA) and equilibrated with DMEM containing FAFA for

216

24 hours. The cells were then washed twice and incubated with HDL (50μg ApoA-I/mL) for 8

217

hours. Media were collected and the radioactivity measured in a beta-scintillation counter. Cells

218

were rinsed twice with cold physiologic saline and the intracellular lipids extracted with hexane:

219

isopropanol (3:2, v/v). Solvent was evaporated and radioactivity measured. The percentage of

2.11. HDL-mediated platelet aggregation inhibition

14

C-free cholesterol (0.3μCi / mL). After 48h, cells were washed with PBS

C-CEC was calculated as (14C-cholesterol in the medium/14C-cholesterol in cells+medium)

223

HDL ability to inhibit platelet aggregation was measured as described by Valiyaveettil

224

et al[22]. HDL (0.8mg protein/mL) was mildly oxidized by dialysis against PBS + 5μM CuSO4,

225

for 24h at 37°C. Citrated blood was drawn from a healthy donor and platelet-rich plasma (PRP)

226

obtained by centrifugation at 800rpm for 15 minutes. PRP was then incubated with native or

227

oxidized HDL (0.5 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Platelet aggregation was monitored using a

228

Lumi-Aggregometer type 500 VS (Chrono-log, Havertown, USA) for 6 minutes after the

229

addition of ADP (5μM). Results are expressed as percentage of the inhibition of platelet

230

aggregation induced by oxidized compared to native HDL.

231

2.12. Statistical analysis

232

The distribution of all variables was tested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Jonckheere-

233

Terpstra trend in one-tail test was used to evaluate demographic, clinical variables and HDL

234

characterization among three groups clustered using BMI and expressed as median and

235

interquartile range. ANCOVA was used to perform comparisons among groups involving

236

enzymatic components of HDL adjusted for age, sex, and HOMA2 %S. Generalized linear

237

models with type III sums of squares were used to assess interactions of BMI within the

238

association between HDL functions and cIMT, the only outcome, adjusted for age, sex, HDL-C,

239

BMI, and HOMA2 %S. HDL functions and HDL-C were modeled with generalized linear

240

regression. The BMI effect on the cIMT among six HDL functions (HDL-C, HDL size,

241

antioxidant activity, CEC, HDL-mediated platelet inhibition, and anti-inflammatory activity)

242

was evaluated with the use of interaction tests. We used complete case analysis to handle

243

missing data. To construct the 3D surface plot 1, we included only HDL-C values between

244

40mg / dL and 100mg / dL; HDL size between 7.0 nm and 9.5 nm; CEC between 8% and 20%;

245

antioxidant activity between 0 and 100%. For the remainder of the regression analyzes, we used

246

the entire sample size of the sub-sample of 99 individuals. Two-sided p≤0.05 were considered to

247

®
indicate statistical significance. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 21.0

248

statistical software. Scatter plot was performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0 for Mac,

249

GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com”. Polinomial splines were

250

used to evaluate the relation between BMI or carotid IMT vs CEC or Antioxidant activity or a

251

compound variable, after transforming CEC and Antioxidant activity into positive z-scores. The

252

compound variable (Z-Efflux + Z-Antioxidant activity) was defined by the sum of z-scores for

253

CEC and antioxidant activity. In order to avoid overfitting, we excluded extreme values at x-

254

axis (<5th percentile and >95%percentile) and smoothing parameters for polinomial derivation

255

(degrees of freedom [df] and lambda) were defined after cross validation. Spline curves were

256

performed in R software, version 3.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). We used

257

®
MATLAB (version 4.10, The MathWorks, Inc, Apple Hill Drive Natick, MA) to fit a 3D

258

curve using second polynomial least square surface.

3. Results

261

3.1. Overall study participants characteristics

262

The baseline characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1 stratified by BMI status

263

(n=899). The female gender prevailed among the participants and BMI values were associated

264

with waist circumference, increased cIMT and impaired metabolic parameters; i.e. lower HDL-

265

C, Apo-AI and HOMA2%S, as well as higher triglycerides, insulin and fasting glucose.

266

Similarly, a stepped increase in LDL-C and total cholesterol was also noted with increasing

267

BMI.

3.2. Association between BMI, HDL-C and cIMT

269

In the whole studied sample (n=899), multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for

270

BMI, age, gender, and plasma insulin or HOMA2-IR, confirmed the association between cIMT

271

and HDL-C (β=-0.11; 95%CI=-0.020;0.000; p=0.03) and identified the existence of a

272

significant interaction of BMI upon this association (β=-1.80; p<0.0001). To visualize the

273

pattern for such BMI interaction, 3D surface plots were applied based on second polynomial

274

least square regression (Figure 1). As shown in the Figure 1A, in subjects with increased BMI,

275

reduced HDL-C levels were associated with increased cIMT. In contrast, in those individuals

276

with reduced BMI, no clear association was found between HDL-C and cIMT. In order to

277

provide a deeper assessment of this interaction, a broad spectrum of HDL functions was

278

investigated in a subgroup of these individuals. As it would be expected, an inverse association

279

was found between BMI and HDL-C (Spearman’s rho -0.028, p < 0.0001) and HDL size

280

(Spearman’s rho -0.175, p < 0.0001).

281

3.3. Association between BMI, HDL functions and cIMT in the subgroup analyses

282

The subgroup characteristics are shown on Table 2. In the subgroup, we found a stepped

283

decrease of total HDL mass, HDL size, and HDL content in triglyceride, free cholesterol,

284

cholesteryl ester, and phospholipid across BMI categories (Table 3). PON activity adjusted for

285

the total number of HDL particles, i.e. PON/HDL-C ratio, increased in parallel with BMI

286

categories. There was no relation between BMI categories and activities of PLTP, LCAT, HL or

287

LPL (Table 3).

288

In line with previous studies, as shown in Figure 2A (linear beta -0.38, polynomial

289

R2=0.19, p=0.001; Spearman’s rho -0.32, p<0.001), we reported a progressive decline in CEC

290

as BMI increases. In contrast, we found a progressive increase in HDL antioxidant activity

291

which was proportional and reciprocal as compared with CEC (linear beta +1.38, polynomial

292

R2=0.12, p=0.04) (Figure 2B). Both changes were mainly mediated by the HDL size which is

293

inversely related to weight gain. Based on this assumption, the compound variable of z-

294

transformed efflux plus antioxidant activity should remain approximately constant as HDL size

295

changes due to excess weight (p value 0.75) (Figure 2C). Increasing values of the compound

variable were associated lower carotid IMT (linear beta -0.10, polynomial R2=0.26, p<0.001)

297

(Figure 2D). Still, correlation analyses were made between BMI and HDL functions. An inverse

298

association was also found with HDL-mediated platelet inhibition (Spearman’s rho -0.157, p <

299

0.03). No correlation was found between BMI and HDL anti-inflammatory activity (Spearman’s

300

rho -0.009, p < 0.904) nor between each of the HDL functions.

301

Since both the abundance of substrate, i.e. triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and the activities of

302

transport proteins are potentially involved in the effect of excess weight on HDL phenotype,

303

multivariate linear regression models were applied to estimate the influence of intravascular

304

HDL-remodeling proteins, i.e. CETP, LPL, HL, LCAT and PLTP on HDL size. CETP (β=-0.12;

305

95%CI=-0.30;-0.01; p=0.030), HL (β=-0.28; 95%CI=-0.35;-0.12; p<0.0001) and LCAT (β=-

306

0.36; 95%CI=-0.28;-0.13; p<0.0001) were drivers for HDL size. HDL size was also associated

307

with plasma triglycerides (β=-0.17; 95%CI=-0.06;-0.02; p<0.001), HOMA2-IR (β=0.21;

308

95%CI=0.01;0.42; p=0.001), PON activity/HDL-C (β=-0.33; 95%CI=-0.47;-0.13; p<0.0001)

309

and HDL-mediated antioxidant activity (β=-0.70; 95%CI=-0.81;-0.12; p=0.009). Association

310

was found between HOMA2-IR and HDL-mediated antioxidant activity (β=-2.1; 95%CI=-

311

3.66;-0.60; p=0.007).

312

In order to estimate the association between HDL functions and cIMT, we used multiple

313

linear regression with adjustments for the following confounders (BMI, age, sex, HDL-c and

314

insulin), which were selected based on univariate significance or clinical relevance (age, sex)

315

(Table 4). We observed a negative association between CEC and cIMT, which remained

316

significant after initial adjustment for the same confounders above, or even after adjustment for

317

HDL size (β=-0.18; 95%CI=-0.138; -0.011; p=0.02), antioxidant activity (β=-0.19; 95%CI=-

318

0.003;0.000; p=0.04) and PON activity/HDL-C (β=-0.16; 95%CI=-0.065;-0.002; p=0.02). The

319

antioxidant activity of HDL was also inversely related to cIMT. Anti-inflammatory activity,

320

PON activity/HDL-C and HDL-mediated platelet inhibition were not associated with cIMT in

321

an adjusted model.

322

Interactions of BMI were found within the linear associations between cIMT and CEC

323

(p=0.03), and cIMT and antioxidant activity (p=0.04). Although the 95% CI suggests a tendency

324

towards a moderating effect of the BMI on the association between HDL size and cIMT, this

325

interaction did not reach statistical significance (p=0.13) (Fig. 1B). As displayed in Fig 1C, the

326

inverse association between CEC and cIMT seems to increase in parallel with BMI values. In

327

contrast, as shown in Fig 1D, the inverse association between cIMT and antioxidant activity of

328

HDL increases with increasing BMI. In fact, the correlation between cIMT and antioxidant

329

activity is greater in individuals with BMI above the median (23.6 kg/m2) (r=-0.33; p=0.037)

330

than in their counterparts (r=-0.2; p=0.05) while the correlation between CEC and cIMT is equal

331

in both subgroups (above, r=-0.28; p=0.042; below, r=-0.28;p=0.016).

4. Discussion
Recent data have shown that the predictive value of HDL-C for estimating the risk of

336

cardiovascular events declines after CVD manifestation[23]; a failure that has been attributed to

337

the increased generation of dysfunctional HDL in a setting of chronic or acute disease. As

338

pointed out in subjects with CVD, we hypothesized that excess weight may influence the

339

relationship between HDL-C and the risk of atherosclerotic disease. After confirming this

340

hypothesis, we moved forward investigating whether more subtle changes in the HDL system

341

could occur in overweight individuals and whether this could justify a change in the association

342

pattern between HDL-C and atherosclerotic disease. Taken together, our findings revealed the

343

following evidence: (i) the pattern of association between HDL-C and cIMT differs according to

344

the presence or absence of excess weight; (ii) increased BMI is associated with the simultaneous

345

change of multiple anti-atherosclerotic functions of HDL, including CEC and antioxidant

346

activity; (iii) the existing association between excess weight and carotid atherosclerotic burden

347

is in part attributable to HDL dysfunction; and (iv) HDL-mediated inhibition of platelet

348

aggregation declines with excess weight.

349

To the best of our knowledge, only few studies have previously assessed the impact of

350

body weight on HDL function in non-obese individuals and none used a simultaneous

351

assessment of multiple functions. In this clinical setting, CEC has been the main HDL function

352

assessed, which was investigated in interventional [3], case-control[24] and cross-sectional [5]

353

studies. In a large nested case-control study from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, for example,

354

discrete changes in BMI in the overweight range was inversely correlated with CEC [24]. On

355

this specific aspect, our results are in line with previous studies.

356

Weight gain promotes a wide range of metabolic changes, among which insulin

357

resistance is the cornerstone for CVD risk. As a result of insulin resistance, for example, there is

358

an increase in the fatty acid efflux and in the activities of CETP and HL leading to a reduction

359

in HDL size, an increase in the ApoA-I catabolic rate and a reduction in CEC[5, 25, 26]. In

360

contrast with the evidence in obese subjects [27-29], our study did not identify changes in CETP

361

and HL activities across BMI categories although their activities were associated with HDL size

362

change. Thus, at this stage of excess weight, the biochemical and size changes in HDL particles

363

is more likely a consequence of increased substrate for HDL particle remodeling, i.e. increased

364

plasma concentration of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

365

These changes in the HDL system have traditionally been reported as a component

366

cause for the increased risk of CVD in obese individuals[30]. In those who are overweight but

367

below the obesity threshold, we revealed a similar scenario, i.e. insulin resistance inversely

368

relates with overweight, HDL size and CEC. It is interesting to note that these changes occurred

369

even before the threshold for overweight as defined by World Health Organization (WHO).

370

Thus, according to previous translational studies[31] or actuarial analyzes based on

371

observational cohorts[32], our data support the concept that the threshold for pathogenic body

372

mass is probably below the WHO definition.

373

Although it is clear that there is functional impairment, it is plausible that the change in

374

the HDL phenotype would have an adaptive biological purpose motivated by the chronic

375

increase of oxidative stress and by low-grade systemic inflammation. Similar reduction of HDL

376

size has been reported in individuals who exhibit acute phase response, such as in myocardial

377

infarction[33] and sepsis[34]. In these conditions, the reduction of HDL size is associated with a

378

greater capacity to mitigate the oxidative stress. In agreement with this and consistent with

379

previous studies, HDL size was inversely associated with increased antioxidant and PON

380

activities[35]. Interestingly, the predominance of small HDL (7.3-8.2 nm) in this cohort was

381

associated with an attenuated impact of BMI on cIMT. Hence, overweight-induced remodeling

382

in HDL simultaneously promoted the reduction of an anti-atherosclerotic mechanism, i.e. CEC,

383

and the increase of another, i.e. antioxidant activity, suggesting a biological response of the

384

HDL system to the predominant pro-atherosclerotic stimulus. Besides, the present study shows

385

that estimates of the magnitude of HDL participation in the CVD risk in excess weight are

386

naturally imprecise unless a broad range of anti-atherosclerotic functions is simultaneously

387

investigated.

388

Obesity is clearly shown to be a prothrombotic state resulting from a combination of

389

increased thrombin generation, platelet hyperactivity and decreased fibrinolysis[36]. Increased

390

platelet reactivity is the result of the interaction between multiple characteristics grouped into

391

obesity, including inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and adiposopathy with

392

change in adipokine secretion pattern. Our study added to this state of knowledge, a new

393

mechanism of imbalance in platelet activity; inhibition of HDL-mediated platelet aggregation

394

was inversely associated with BMI. This finding should be considered in the set of

395

prothrombotic changes of excess weight and as one of the mechanisms by which there is an

396

increase in the incidence of cardiovascular events in these individuals.

397

Among the main limitations in the present study lies the fact that it is based on a cross-

398

sectional design. In addition, due to the intensive laborious methodology involved in studying a

399

full breadth of HDL function and metabolic pathways, we may have not been able to maintain

400

the desired statistical power obtained as when the entire studied population was analyzed. In

401

spite of this, it does provide us a unique opportunity to evaluate the association between excess

402

weight and the HDL system early in the spectrum of metabolic derangement and atherogenesis.

403

In fact, this may especially be true given the low rates of insulin resistance and more favorable

404

lipid profile and systemic inflammatory activity of our study’s participants.

405

In conclusion, our study indicates that higher BMI, even in non-obese, non-diabetic

406

individuals, is associated with decreased function of several protective activities of HDL. In

407

individuals with increased BMI, HDL dysfunction is directly associated with increased

variables. This surface plot displays an image based on the relationship between the BMI and

576

HDL variables as predictors on the x- and y-axes and a continuous surface that represents the

577

cIMT values on the z-axis. The peak on the plot corresponds with the yellow color and the

578

highest value obtained to cIMT using the combination of X and Y that produce the maxima

579

cIMT, which occurs at approximately 0.8mm. The valley corresponds with blue color and the

580

combination of X and Y that produce the minima cIMT. Figure 1A, HDL-C values. Figure 1B,

581

HDL size. Figure 1C, CEC values. Figure 1D, antioxidant activity of HDL. HDL-C, high-

582

density lipoprotein cholesterol in mg/dL. BMI, body mass index in kg/m2. CEC is expressed as

583

a percentage of efflux in the sample, normalized to a reference sample. Antioxidant activity is

584

expressed in % as inhibition of LDL oxidation in the presence of each subject’s HDL oxidation.
