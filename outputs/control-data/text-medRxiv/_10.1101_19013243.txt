Abstract

27

AIM: We aimed to document current clinical practice and needs in screening for visual

28

perception problems after stroke to inform development of new screening tools.

29

METHODS: We interviewed 25 health care professionals (12 occupational therapists, 13

30

orthoptists) from 16 organisations in England. Interviews were transcribed and coded in

31

NVivo Software. Data were thematically analysed using the Value Proposition Canvas, a

32

model which establishes what people want to achieve, the challenges they face and what

33

facilitates their jobs.

34

RESULTS: Participants’ understanding of visual perception varied and often included sensory

35

and cognitive deficits. Occupational therapists commonly screened for visual field deficits

36

and hemispatial neglect, while other aspects of visual cognition were rarely assessed. They

37

decided on referrals to orthoptists for further assessment. Screening generally occurred

38

during functional assessments and/or with in-house developed tools. Challenges to practice

39

were: lack of time, lack of training, environmental and stroke survivor factors (e.g. aphasia),

40

insufficient continuation of care, and test characteristics (e.g. not evidence-based).

41

Facilitators to practice were: quick and practical tools, experienced staff or tools with

42

minimal training requirements, a streamlined care pathway between a stroke unit and eye

43

hospital supported by occupational therapists and orthoptists.

44

CONCLUSION: Screening employs non-standardised assessments and rarely covers visual

45

perceptual deficits in higher order perception. Our service evaluation demonstrates the

46

need for a standardised visual perception screen, which should ideally be 15 minutes or less,

47

be portable, and require minimal equipment. The screen should be suitable for bedside

48

testing in noisy environments, inclusive for participants with aphasia and evidence-based.

Introduction

50

Lilian Kallir, a concert pianist, could no longer read music from one day to the next. Brain

51

damage left her with the inability to read although she was perfectly capable of writing and

52

had not gone blind. This case described by Oliver Sacks illustrates the importance of our

53

brain in processing visual information to make sense of the world around us.1

54

Visual perception is the dynamic process of perceiving the environment through sensory

55

inputs and translating the sensory input into meaningful concepts associated with visual

56

knowledge of the environment.2 Visual perception problems are therefore distinct from

57

sensory visual impairments such as reduced visual acuity, visual field and eye movements.3

58

Where sensory visual impairments result from damage to the eye or early visual pathways

59

from the eye to the primary visual cortex, visual perception deficits are attributed to

60

impaired function in later visual processing areas in the occipital, parietal and temporal

61

cortex.4 Examples of visual perceptual deficits include apperceptive and associative agnosia,

62

prosopagnosia, akinetopsia, achromatopsia, problems in visual memory, and in visuospatial

63

abilitities.4 Visual inattention or hemispatial neglect is sometimes considered to be part of

64

visual perception,2,5 though neuropsychology research attributes this to an attentional

65

deficit.6 In particular the presence of preserved perception when attention is stretched to

66

focus on the stimuli, the existence of cross-modal neglect and manipulations of stimulus

67

density on the extent of neglect support the classification of hemispatial neglect as a

68

disorder of attention. 7,8

69

Lilian is not an isolated case: Rowe and colleagues reported that 20% of stroke survivors

70

with a suspected visual difficulty have visual perception deficits.9 This study made use of

71

reports by stroke survivors and carers rather than formal assessment. With systematic

72

screening with the Rivermead Perceptual Assessment Battery, Edmans and Lincoln

73

identified visual perception problems in 76% of hemiplegic stroke survivors.10 The

74

discrepancy between prevalence with self-reports compare to neuropsychological

75

assessment suggests that not all visual perceptual problems are picked up based on self-

76

report. This means many stroke survivors are discharged without the appropriate

77

rehabilitation or adjustments in their home environment or care packages.

78

Under-diagnosis of visual perception problems can severely impact stroke survivors’ quality

79

of life, functional outcome, participation in the community, independence and pose

80

substantial risk. 11–15 For instance, participation in traffic with visual perception problems

81

can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Risks are also heightened indoors when

82

preparing a meal or in perceiving trip hazards. Better diagnosis of visual perception

83

difficulties after stroke will allow better care planning and substantially impact stroke

84

survivors’ life.

85

The first step toward better diagnosis is an in-depth understanding of the clinical reality and

86

the reasons behind under-diagnosis. We need to understand what the challenges are in

87

screening for visual perceptual difficulties after stroke. This can then inform the

88

development of solutions.

89

In the current study, we aimed to conduct an in-depth exploration of current clinical

90

practice, challenges and facilitators of screening for visual perception problems after stroke.

91

To achieve a rich understanding of these issues, we performed semi-structured interviews

92

with orthoptists and occupational therapists. These professionals are most commonly

93

involved in visual perception screening after stroke in the United Kingdom’s National Health

94

Service.

Methods

96

Participants

97

All participants were recruited via opportunistic and snowball sampling. Invitations for the

98

interviews were sent out through (i) email to the British and Irish Orthoptic Society Stroke

99

and Neuro Rehab Special Interest Group, (ii) Twitter, (iii) a sign-up sheet at a conference

100

poster and (iv) informal face-to-face conversations at the United Kingdom Stroke Forum

101

2018. Participants met inclusion criteria if they were working in the National Health Service

102

as an occupational therapist or an orthoptist, and were involved in the assessment of visual

103

perceptual problems after stroke. The participants were informed about the aims of the

104

study, the organisations running the study (University of Oxford and North Bristol NHS

105

Trust), and the planned outcomes and dissemination. The latter made explicit that the

106

results would be used to design a national survey on the topic to inform the development of

107

a new visual perception screen for stroke survivors. The project was reviewed and approved

108

by the Patient Safety Assurance & Audit Service at NHS North Bristol Trust as a Clinical

109

Effectiveness study (CE45999). All participants gave verbal consent.

110

Interviewer’s training

111

All interviews were conducted over the phone by the first author, KV, who holds an MSc in

112

Clinical Psychology and a PhD in Experimental Psychology. At the time of the research study

113

KV was working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Oxford. KV had nine

114

years’ experience as a researcher, including one year as a qualitative researcher. Her formal

115

training in qualitative research included an undergraduate course in qualitative research

116

methods at the University of Leuven which included a research project. In preparation for

117

the current project, she was trained and supervised by senior author, OH. OH is a clinical

118

psychologist who has worked predominantly as a qualitative researcher and health care

119

professional within the field of intellectual disabilities. OH has numerous publications within

120

this field, teaches qualitative research methods at the University of Oxford, and has

121

supervised a number of doctoral projects using various qualitative methodologies. KV’s

122

training included reading and reflecting on reference works in qualitative research,16,17 a

123

question and answer session with an experienced moderator, and guidance during coding

124

and analyses via regular meetings with OH.

125

Model

126

The interview process and qualitative analysis was guided by the Value Proposition Canvas.

127

This model was originally designed to guide product development, but can be applied to

128

different contexts.18 Central to this model is the principle that development of products or

129

services are best informed by the users. A good product or service takes into account the

130

goals of the user, it reduces the pains a user experiences while trying to achieve their goals,

131

and it provides gains in achieving their goals. For instance a good electric car helps a person

132

to get to work (goal to achieve) without having to fear that the battery will run out (reduce

133

pains) while at the same time provides a beautiful design to impress colleagues and family

134

(increase gains). We can apply this model in trying to understand current clinical practice in

135

visual perception screening after stroke (goal), the challenges (pains) it brings, and what

136

facilitates the process (gains).

137

Data collection

138

A semi-structured interview guide was developed by KV in collaboration with an

139

occupational therapist and an orthoptist (Table 1). The interview guide was reviewed by an

140

experienced moderator and piloted with one orthoptist and three occupational therapists.

141

The interviews consisted of open-ended questions about current practice in visual

142

perception screening after stroke, and the challenges and facilitators of practice. The

143

interviewer conducted interviews at the participant’s workplace or over the phone in a quiet

144

office with no other people present. The participants took the call in a location of their

145

choice. The location and presence of others at the participant’s side was not recorded. After

146

obtaining participant consent, the interview was audio recorded. All participants were

147

interviewed once. Interviews took place between October 2018 and January 2019.

148

Recruitment was ongoing during data collection and interviews were conducted until data

149

saturation was reached.

Qualitative Analyses

153

As a method of data analysis we used thematic analysis.19 Interviews were transcribed

154

verbatim by a professional typist via an external service provider. The transcripts were not

155

returned to the participants for feedback. Two researchers (KV and MC) were involved in

156

data analysis. KV was familiar with the data from conducting the interviews (Phase 1 in

157

thematic analysis). The first 15 interviews were checked and coded by KV in NVivo Software

158

(Version 12.0). She developed an initial coding tree (Phase 2 in thematic analysis). Overall

159

themes were set in advance in alignment with the Value Proposition Model: Jobs,

160

Challenges, and Facilitators. The coding tree was reviewed and substantially adapted after

161

coding of five interviews. MC familiarised himself with the data by checking transcripts and

162

reading through interviews coded by KV. Two of these interview transcripts were checked,

163

coded and discussed by both KV and MC to align their coding. MC checked and coded the

164

remaining 10 interview transcripts. The frequency of text extracts coded under each node

165

was visualised with a hierarchical chart of nodes in NVivo to explore overall patterns in the

166

data describing current practice. This chart shows the frequency of references for each node

167

when participants were talking about current practice in routine visual and visual perception

168

screening. Only nodes with at least ten references were included. Overall themes and

169

subthemes were derived from the data by KV (Phase 3 of thematic analysis). This was done

170

in two stages: (1) we performed search queries of coded text for challenges and facilitators

171

of visual perception screening in current practice and (2) read through the resulting text.

172

The themes were subsequently reviewed by reading all answers to the questions under the

173

headings Challenges and Facilitators (see Table 2). The information was then synthesised by

174

KV (Phase 4 of thematic analysis). Lastly, themes and subthemes were reviewed, refined and

175

defined by KV (Phase 5 of thematic analysis) and a report was prepared (Phase 6 of thematic

176

analysis). This report was sent out to the participants for validation. Ten out of 25

177

participants replied and nine agreed with the thematic analysis. One participant pointed out

178

that participants’ understanding of visual perception was underexplored. We added a

179

results section on this topic posthoc.

180

Results

181

12 occupational therapists and 13 orthoptists from 16 health care organisations in England

182

took part in the study. Characteristics of each participant are reported in Table 2. All

183

participants worked in England, and were based across the East Midlands (n=1), East of

184

England (n=1), Greater London (n=2), North East (n=3), North West (n=4), South East (n=6),

185

South West (n=4), and Yorkshire and the Humber (n=4). The interviewer had no personal

186

relationship with any of the participants. Two orthoptists received referrals from the same

187

acute stroke unit where the first author recruits stroke survivors as participants for other

188

studies (pseudonyms cannot be disclosed to ensure anonymity). One of the participants was

189

also involved in the development of the interview guide. All but one participant (Jessica)

190

agreed to be audio recorded. For Jessica, notes were made during and immediately after the

191

interview. Interviews lasted between 16 and 46 minutes with an average of 27 minutes. For

192

Christopher, the interview was split over two consecutive days.

Participants understanding of visual perception

199

The interviews highlighted that participants’ understanding of visual perception differed

200

from textbook definitions of visual perception. Visual perception is defined as a dynamic

201

process of translating sensory visual information into meaning percepts2. These percepts

202

can subsequently be linked to higher cognitive functions like visual memory for recognition

203

(ventral of what stream) and praxis for visually guided actions (dorsal or where stream)4.

204

Visual perception must be differentiated from low level sensory visual functions like acuity,

205

visual fields, and ocular movements, and from higher cognitive processes like (visual)

206

memory or (visual) inattention, although some authors consider visual inattention to be part

207

of visual perception. Our participants seemed to have a broader understanding of visual

208

perception and often did not differentiate between sensory and higher cognitive functions.

209

Participants typically mentioned the following examples when asked about what they

210

consider visual perceptual problems (in descending order of frequency): visual inattention,

211

agnosia’s for objects, faces, letters, or shapes, hallucinations or Charles Bonnet syndrome,

212

difficulties in depth perception, visual field deficits like hemianopia, and spatial vision (e.g.

213

navigating and perceiving space around them).

214

Participants’ understanding seemed to vary widely but we observed general trends in the

215

different professions. Orthoptists seemed to differentiate visual perception difficulties from

216

low level sensory visual impairments, but considered visual inattention the prime (and only)

217

example of visual perception difficulties after stroke.

218

“[Interviewer: What comes to your mind, when I say visual perception problems in stroke

219

patients?

220

other side is presented to them as well, is the main definition of it. That it’s decreased

221

awareness of that side of their vision and their external world as well as themselves as well,

222

on that side. [Interviewer: Anything else, that falls under that term for you?] No, not that I

223

can think of, off the top of my head, no.” (Tiffany, Orthoptist in an eye clinic)

] So I would probably say visual neglect, ignoring one side of their world when the

224

In addition to visual inattention, occupational therapists mentioned impairments that are

225

typically (but not exclusively) related to low level sensory vision like contrast sensitivity,

226

hemianopia, and depth perception. They seemed to interpret visual perception more

227

broadly.

228

“A range really. So we would look at visual perception as things like depth perception, …

229

recognition of objects, … and any kind of visual inattention or neglect, that sort of thing…

230

But yes, that’s it basically.” (Danielle, Occupation Therapist in an acute stroke service)

231

These observations are relevant in interpreting the subsequent results. Although the

232

interview questions asked for experiences with visual perception assessment after stroke,

233

the results below should be interpreted as potentially referring to all or any of the following:

234

sensory visual impairments (for occupational therapist participants), visual perception

235

impairments (for all participants), and visual inattention (for all participants).

236

Current Practice

237

A hierarchical chart of nodes is presented in Figure 1. The figure illustrates that participants

238

most often mentioned occupational therapists working in acute stroke or rehabilitation

239

services when discussing screening for visual neglect, visual field deficits, and ocular

240

movements. For screening they referred to in-house developed screening tools,

241

standardised tests or observations in functional tasks like dressing and making a cup of tea.

242

“In terms of the visual field, we do the standard, you know, wiggle your fingers

243

test to see how people respond. We do the tracking tests. Otherwise it’s mainly

244

through observing people in functional tasks what they’re doing. ... Through that

245

you can often realise ... if they’re having problems with their visual perception

246

because they’re missing things or not seeing things.” (Crystal, occupational

247

therapist in a stroke rehabilitation service)

248

“I’d rather do it in function. So it’s more meaningful especially with stroke

249

patients because it makes more sense. Rather than getting them to balance

250

cubes on each other or, you know, I can say ‘can you, can you find the

251

toothpaste?’ ” (Megan, occupational therapist in an acute stroke service)

252

Participants mentioned both positive and negative aspects of the process, referring to the

253

conditions of the stroke survivor and the physical environment, time limitations, staff

254

training and relationships with other staff members. These themes are explored in greater

255

detail in subsequent paragraphs on Challenges and Facilitators.

256

“I think for us, it’s a multitude of things, it’s an acute unit, through-put is quite

257

quick, it’s an environment that often doesn’t lend itself to a nice quiet space

258

where patients can attend … from an OT [occupational therapist] point of view,

259

there’s not a lot of OTs who are actually for [delivering] the therapy, so time-wise

260

we haven’t got a lot of capacity at times, to do that.” (Danielle, occupational

261

therapist in an acute stroke service)

262

“It can be a bit frustrating … because lots of the occupational therapists are on a

263

rotational job. So getting them trained up [is difficult]. I think they do find vision

264

scary.” (Stephanie, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

screening. Only nodes with at least ten references are shown. (colour version available online)

269

Most participants mentioned that the service they work within has a referral pathway in

270

place: if problems are suspected following screening by the occupational therapist, a

271

referral is made to orthoptics. A stroke orthoptist will then see the stroke survivor as an

272

inpatient on the unit or as an outpatient after discharge from the hospital.

273

“It’s really as and how other health professionals have identified them, then an

274

orthoptist will go up to try and assert a diagnosis and then give them the

275

rehabilitation options.” (Amy, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

276

Screening by an occupational therapist followed by referral (if suitable) to orthoptics is seen

277

as an efficient system.

278

“Whereas since we’ve set up a proper vision screening it just means that things

279

have been a lot more efficient and that’s made a much better service because

280

they’re not having to see a lot of people that don’t need to be seen. ... And we’ve

281

got our waiting lists down substantially so it’s just helped things a long quite a

282

lot.” (Nicole, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

283

Challenges

284

Themes around challenges in visual perception screening are presented in Table 3. We

285

identified five major themes and 13 subthemes.

286

Lack of time

287

Occupational therapists and orthoptists both reported that time pressure makes visual

288

perception screening difficult. They mentioned that because of understaffing they spend

289

little time with stroke survivors or experience delays in seeing them following referral. In

290

addition, occupational therapists report that stroke survivors are discharged from an acute

291

stroke unit as soon as medically safe and a suitable discharge location has been organised.

292

For survivors with milder strokes, discharge is reported to happen within 1-2 days, giving

293

very little time for therapists to complete their assessments.

294

“Well one [challenge] is just logistically and organisationally, just in terms of

295

caseload and time to hand. We are having to prioritise more direct functional

296

assessments in terms of establishing readiness for discharge.” (Christopher,

297

occupational therapist in an acute stroke service)

298

“Often we don’t get the chance to use it [assessment instruments] that much

299

because they’re either too unwell for us to do them with or they get to the point

300

where they’re well enough and then they get taken off to a rehab facility.”

301

(Danielle, occupational therapist in an acute stroke service)

302

“There’s not a lot of OTs who are actually for [delivering] the therapy, so time-

303

wise we haven’t got a lot of capacity at times.” (Danielle, occupational therapist

304

in an acute stroke service)

305

“Lack of time is always going to be frustrating knowing that you’ve got a clinic

306

here and you can’t get up to the ward and there’s an urgent stroke survivor.”

307

(Heather, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

308

“Erm… it sounds awful doesn’t it when you’re constantly having to slim down

309

what you do.” (Melissa, occupational therapist in an acute stroke service)

310

Lack of training

311

Training is another theme that frequently emerged across both professions. Visual

312

perception difficulties following stroke appear to be only briefly covered in the

313

undergraduate education of orthoptists and occupational therapists, and is mostly learned

314

about post-qualification through on-the-job-training. Many occupational therapists

315

mentioned that they rotate between services, leaving little time for them to be trained in

316

many aspects of stroke care. In particular, they said that this lack of experience made them

317

feel uncertain when it comes to vision and visual perception deficits following stroke.

318

Inexperience and limited training seemed to be an important hurdle for occupational

319

therapists in visual perception screening. Because vision and visual perception was not well

320

understood by the staff (see above), participants reported that mistakes in assessments are

321

commonly made, leading to a potential under-diagnosis of visual perception deficits.

322

“[It]

323

rotational job. So getting them trained up, I think they do find vision scary....

324

Vision, it’s the scariest thing about stroke.” (Stephanie, orthoptists in an eye

325

clinic)

326

“[Visual perception is ]

327

understood.... think unless you’ve got a unit with a special interest in stroke and

328

you’ve taken the time to look into that... then it’s perhaps under-diagnosed as

329

well, so yeah I think it’s recognition that it’s a potential problem.” (Amanda,

330

orthoptist in an eye clinic)

331

“Erm, yeah because visual and cognitive [problems] post stroke ... are not well

332

known. Everybody thinks you know the FAST but nobody thinks of vision as part

can be a bit frustrating ... lots of the occupational therapists are on a

one of those things that is perhaps not widely

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013243; this version posted November 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

333

of that. ... And sometimes vision is the only thing that’s affected post stroke.”

334

(Rachel, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

335

“The key is really, somebody in the hospital to be able to deliver the training and

336

the therapy staff to actually take on board the training and to actually deliver it.”

337

(Sarah, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

338

“I think it probably is underreported; the amount of incidents of perceptual

339

problems post stroke.” (Rachel, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

340

Environmental and stroke survivor factors

341

Participants reported that visual perception screening is limited by the environment in

342

which they take place. They said that in acute stroke care, most assessments are done in a

343

hospital bay with several beds. Even if curtains can be drawn around the stroke survivor’s

344

bed, distractions were reported to be numerous: sounds from neighbouring beds,

345

interruptions for timed caring needs, distractions from medical equipment around the bed

346

and presence of personal objects on a small table in front of the stroke survivor (spectacles,

347

drinks, food, tissues, personal care items, newspaper, get well cards, crossword book, pen,

348

etc.) can be visually distracting and interfere with visual perceptual assessment.

349

“Frustrating for us is ... that we .. depending on which unit we are [on] or where

350

we are, it can be quite difficult to do [our assessment at] the bedside if there is a

351

lot [of] distractions going on; if there is no quiet space to take the patient.

352

Obviously, yes, we can draw the curtains but it’s sometimes more the noise levels

353

than everything. They get easily distracted. That makes it quite hard actually to

354

do an assessment.” (Amber, occupational therapist in a stroke rehabilitation

355

service)

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013243; this version posted November 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

356

“It’s [the] environment. Often [it] doesn’t lend itself to a nice quiet space where

357

patients can attend.” (Danielle, occupational therapist in an acute stroke service)

358

Participants also mentioned the condition of the stroke survivors as a limiting factor to

359

visual perception screening. Both professions reported that tests and tools are often not

360

suitable for stroke survivors with poor alertness, poor cognition, aphasia or severe weakness

361

in their upper limbs. For instance, stroke survivors may not able to answer a question on

362

whether their vision has changed because they developed aphasia following stroke.

363

Similarly, copying and cancellation tasks to assess visual neglect were reported to be

364

unsuitable for a stroke survivor who can no longer hold a pen.

365

“Another component would be around the client or the patient themselves in

366

terms of factors that might work against screening: so attention, concentration,

367

fatigue, the ability to deliver a verbal response in terms of aphasia or dysarthria

368

difficulties. ... That has significant impact on our ability to undertake formal

369

testing of whatever nature.” (Christopher, occupational therapist in an acute

370

stroke service)

371

“Our patients who either are fatigued quite quickly, or are ... medically not well

372

enough to do a lot of taking down to the therapy department ..., or their

373

attention span is quite limited, or they’ve got a weakness in their upper limb that

374

makes it more difficult to complete the tests.” (Danielle, occupational therapist in

375

an acute stroke service)

376

Continuation of care

377

A further concern of the participants was the follow-up process after screening for visual

378

perception deficits. They highlighted that quite often the information from screening is not

379

passed on to the next care team. Therefore, even if visual perception problems are picked

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013243; this version posted November 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

380

up in an acute setting, no follow-up assessments are carried out or no rehabilitation is

381

provided in their experience. With respect to rehabilitation, occupational therapists found it

382

frustrating that few treatment options are available. They reported that little information

383

and few guidelines are available on how visual perception problems can be treated or

384

managed. Some noted that the lack of options for rehabilitation reduced their motivation to

385

screen for visual perception problems.

386

“Yes, and it [the discharge summary] is very medical because the occupational

387

therapists or myself don’t like the discharge summaries. ... We do all this

388

information and then it gets lost ….Yeah, it’s not part of our discharge summary

389

in enough detail, so when they go somewhere new which could be two or three

390

weeks later ... they don’t have that information.” (Matthew, orthoptist in an eye

391

clinic)

392

“It might be because it [visual

393

why it’s not the focus. So … it would be more useful to spend time during my

394

assessment speaking to them about adapting to their field loss and giving them a

395

prism or occlusion for their double vision.” (Rachel, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

] is limited in treatment … that’s

perception deficits

396

Test characteristics

397

Both professions highlighted limitations in the characteristics of the available tests for visual

398

perception. Occupational therapists more frequently reported to be hindered by practical

399

limitations and the unknown impact on daily life. With respect to the practical limitations,

400

they referred to a large number of test materials like stimulus booklets, stopwatch, cubes,

401

etc. needed for assessment or too many loose pages. With respect to the unknown impact

402

on daily life, they referred to stimuli and tests that were thought to be limited in ecological

403

validity. They considered the tests too abstract with no clear link to the implications for

404

everyday tasks.

405

“We have our little screening tool. It’s a few pages, just to prompt us .... That’s all

406

right but then ... everything else you are ... searching together from different kits.

407

... That’s a little bit frustrating.” (Amber, occupational therapist in a stroke

408

rehabilitation service)

409

“There’s an awful lot of bits of paper and a bit of faffing about and preparing to

410

get it all ready before we actually go out to see the patients.” (Melissa,

411

occupational therapist in an acute stroke service)

412

“We use Rivermead Perceptual Battery. But to be fair, I don’t tend to use it as

413

often because I’d rather do it in function. ...It’s more meaningful, especially with

414

stroke patients because it makes more sense. Rather than getting them to

415

balance cubes on each other or, you know I can say “Can you find the

416

toothpaste? Can you take the lid off? Can you brush your own teeth?” and then

417

it just makes more sense. And then ... it’s easier for them to identify [a] goal.”

418

(Megan, occupational therapist in a stroke rehabilitation service)

419

Orthoptists, on the other hand, seemed to emphasize more the lack of evidence and

420

consequently the lack of specific clinical guidelines on how to assess visual perception.

421

“If you see the national guidelines for visual problems after stroke, they have a

422

really small section on vision with orthoptics but we don’t really have anything in

423

it that’s specific to what we should be screening them with and what we should

424

be treating them with. So even though we’re using evidence-based practice, the

425

evidence sometimes isn’t great and I think that’s probably why it’s not in the

426

guidelines because there’s not really good evidence to support it. But sometimes

427

you’re seeing a patient and you’re not entirely sure if you’re doing the right thing

428

because you’re maybe giving them information based on clinical experience,

429

what other people have been doing but you’re not really sure if that is the best

430

thing to be doing or could you be doing something else with them.” (Amy,

431

orthoptist in an eye clinic)

Facilitators

435

The facilitators to practice that participants reported, largely mirrored the challenges

436

reported above (Table 4). We identified three major themes and 12 subthemes.

437

Practical tool

438

On a practical level, participants preferred a tool that can be administered in approximately

439

10-20 minutes, so it can fit in with busy every-day practice and current staff levels. They also

440

favoured a tool that consists of few test materials and pages to prevent test materials

441

getting lost or mixed up during testing. According to participating orthoptists, the tool

442

should have a 1 to 2 page proforma. They reported that it should include questions to ask

443

the stroke survivor and simple quick tests for a range of functions. They suggested that the

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license .

444

proforma could subsequently be used in a referral for orthoptic input. To allow bedside

445

testing or testing in the community, participants preferred portable tools. Lastly, many

446

participants highlighted that a tool should ideally be suitable for all stroke survivors, such as

447

those with aphasia, poor concentration, poor cognition or severe fatigue.

448

“It needs to be something that’s fairly quick and easy to administer.” (Danielle,

449

occupational therapist in an acute stroke service)

450

“Just pen and paper, quite simple or a few things to hand that will fit in

451

something that’s quite portable and mobile, I think [that] would be handy, yes.”

452

(Brittany, occupational therapist in a stroke rehabilitation service)

453

“Reasonably short … for logistical [reasons]: … our time and patient

454

concentration time, fatigue in the more acute stages. I think really half an hour is

455

the maximum time.” (Christopher, occupational therapist in an acute stroke

456

service)

457

“It would have to be a list of standardised questions: Are they able to look

458

between two points specifically? … I guess the visual perception question would

459

be if they’re following a moving object? … You know are they able to identify

460

their friends or their family? Can they recognise themselves in a photo?” (Rachel,

461

orthoptist in an eye clinic)

462

Training and experience

463

Orthoptists and occupational therapists agreed on the importance of training and

464

experience for robust visual perception screening. The presence of experienced colleagues

465

or training by other staff members was seen as very advantageous. Given the limited

466

training in visual perception highlighted above, a tool that is easy to administer and score

467

was preferred by our participants. Similarly, they reported that results should be easy to

468

interpret, and should provide clear guidance for management of the deficit (if present).

469

“If it was something that was quite self-explanatory then anybody could do it and

470

therefore anybody can interpret it, then that would be much clearer.” (Amy,

471

orthoptist in an eye clinic)

472

“Just easy to administer and easy to score. … So making instructions clear and

473

easy to understand would be good.” (Emily, occupational therapist in a stroke

474

rehabilitation service)

475

Staff roles and interactions

476

Occupational therapists reported that their preferred practice is to screen stroke survivors

477

for vision and visual perception problems during their functional assessments (e.g. washing,

478

making a cup of tea) or via a screening tool. Both professions mention that if a problem is

479

flagged, more in-depth assessment can then take place.

480

“Whereas since we’ve set up a proper vision screening it just means that things

481

have been a lot more efficient and that’s made a much better service because

482

they’re not having to see a lot of people that don’t need to be seen.” (Nicole,

483

orthoptists in an eye clinic)

484

“So, I’m happy with the main basic screen to begin with, and if it digs something

485

up then we’ll dig it in some more detail. I think that works quite well.”

486

(Matthew, orthoptists in an eye clinic)

487

If the problem concerns visual perception difficulties, an occupational therapist is seen by

488

our participants as the most appropriate professional to follow it up. If the problem

489

concerns vision, a referral to an orthoptist was the preferred practice in our sample. Good

490

relationships between stroke occupational therapists and orthoptists in eye clinics were

491

frequently mentioned as invaluable.

492

“I think the key is having the staff, the occupational therapist and the physio staff

493

actually take that on board.” (Sarah, orthoptist in an eye clinic)

Discussion

497

The aim of this qualitative research was to gain a deeper understanding of current practice

498

in visual perception screening after stroke, the challenges faced by health care

499

professionals. This information can then inform what an ideal solution to visual perception

500

screening might look like. In our participants’ stroke care services, occupational therapists

501

most often screened for visual and visual perceptual difficulties. If visual difficulties like

502

hemianopia, double vision or reduced acuity, are found, a referral to an orthoptist is made

503

for an in depth assessment. If visual neglect is suspected, occupational therapists will often

504

follow this up themselves with a range of tasks like cancellations, copying, line bisection,

505

etc. The biggest challenges faced by our participants were lack of time and training.

506

Facilitating factors mentioned were simple, easy to use instruments and good relationships

507

between stroke and eye departments.

508

The qualitative approach of our study allowed us to gather views directly and in depth.

509

Instead of reporting frequency of views (e.g. how many health care professionals report

510

staff shortage), we focus on how central certain views are to a person’s experience. Our

511

large sample size covers the two main professions involved in visual perception screening

512

after stroke.

513

National Clinical Guidelines recommend that every stroke survivor who appears to have

514

perceptual difficulties should have an assessment with standardised measures.3 As is

515

evident from our interviews, only a small proportion of stroke survivors receive an

516

assessment with standardised measures for visual perceptions difficulties, and screening is

517

not routinely done. The means of assessment of visual perception deficits varied widely

518

between participants. Orthoptists will often use standardised tools in their assessments,

519

though these are not necessarily validated with stroke survivors.20,21 Overall, standardised

520

assessments were rarely mentioned by our participants Occupational therapists expressed

521

preferring assessment during functional tasks like washing and dressing and assessment

522

with in-house developed screening checklists. This may be due to a lack of a validated

523

screening tool for a wide range of visual and visual perceptual deficits that can be used by

524

any health care professional.20 The diversity in tools that we observed in our group of

525

English participants contrasts with the reported use of standardised tools in an Australian

526

population where the Occupational Therapy Adult Perceptual Screening Test and the

527

Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment are most commonly used to

528

evaluate visual perceptual difficulties.21

529

McClusky and colleagues investigated the barriers and enablers for following recommended

530

practice in stroke care. In line with our findings the occupational therapists they interviewed

531

reported the condition of the stroke survivors as a barrier for standardised assessments.

532

Many tests are not designed and not suitable for stroke survivors with aphasia and/or

533

dysarthria. Occupational therapists in their study also mentioned the lack of training and

534

knowledge, specifically for visual neglect rehabilitation. Time pressure and fluctuating staff

535

levels meant occupational therapists in their study prioritised assessments and

536

interventions which would produce the best clinical outcome. A lack of time to see stroke

537

survivors was also mentioned by their orthoptists. However, in our study this referred to the

538

lack of time to see all referred stroke survivors before they were discharged, while in the

539

study by McClusky, the orthoptists referred to the lack of time to treat stroke survivors. The

540

standardised assessments used by Australian occupation therapists, Occupational Therapy

541

Adult Perceptual Screening Test and the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive

542

Assessment, require training and take 20-45 minutes to complete. Given the frequently

543

reported lack of training and time, it may appear that the standardised tools recommended

544

by clinical guidelines are not adapted to the clinical reality of the National Health Service in

545

England. Although McClusky’s study was limited to one Australian hospital and only involved

546

5 occupational therapists and 2 orthoptists, all working in the same service and

547

circumstances, the barriers are remarkably similar to what our 12 occupation therapists and

548

13 orthoptists reported experiencing in 16 English healthcare services. The stroke survivor’s

549

condition, lack of time and staff seem to be universal barriers for providing evidence-based

550

stroke care across domains, not just visual perception screening. Also, the lack of

551

information on treatment or management of vision or visual perception problems that

552

occupational therapists mention as a barrier is not surprising given the very limited evidence

553

for treatment and management options.22

554

The first challenge exposed by our study is the variation between participants in their

555

understanding of constitute visual perception problems after stroke. This led to participants

556

answering interview questions with different reference frameworks. When sharing the

557

challenges of visual perception screening in their clinical practice, some might have been

558

considering challenges in just screening for visual inattention difficulties while others

559

considered a broad range of sensory and cognitive visual impairments. To maintain an equal

560

relationship between participant and interviewer, and an open non-judgemental

561

environment to freely share their experiences, participants’ definition of visual perception

562

was not challenged during the interview. A disadvantage of this approach is that it is unclear

563

whether certain themes apply specifically to one aspect of visual and visual perception

564

screening or to the whole range of vision related difficulties after stroke.

565

The second challenge lies in our sample size. Our sample, though the largest for a qualitative

566

study in this topic, is not representative for the whole population of health care

567

professionals involved in visual perception screening after stroke. We limited ourselves to

568

occupational therapists and orthoptists as they are most commonly involved in visual

569

perception screening in England. Experiences might be very different in clinical settings

570

without an orthoptic department or with more involvement of neuropsychologists in stroke

571

care. In addition, voluntary participation and asking our participants to commit 30 minutes

572

of their time might have induced a bias for allied health professionals with a keen interest in

573

the topic. We have possibly missed opinions from people with a more negative or neutral

574

attitude towards visual perception screening. In addition, newly qualified health care

575

professionasl with limited experience in stroke care might not have felt confident enough to

576

share their opinions on the topic. Lack of confidence on this topic with junior staff was

577

brought up by several of our participants. However, the aim of this qualitative research was

578

not to generalise findings to the population, but rather to provide an in-depth exploration of

579

the topic to generate hypotheses. We are following this research up with a large scale

580

survey for all health care professionals involved in visual perception screening in the United

581

Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. In the recruitment to this survey study, we are

582

emphasizing that we welcome the opinions of heath care professionals with all levels of

583

experience.

584

A third potential limitation is that the interviewer was the principal investigator of the study

585

and was therefore not independent. Unconscious bias of the interviewer might have guided

586

the participants’ answers. We have tried to minimize this by using a detailed interview guide

587

that included a list of cues that could be given. In addition, all interviews were recorded and

588

a second coder was involved.

589

Our study limits itself to health care professionals’ perceptive on visual perception screening

590

after stroke. We have not explored experiences by stroke survivors, although they can be

591

substantially different. Also, we have not investigated the management of visual perceptual

592

problems after stroke of their impact in daily life as is previously reported for sensory visual

593

problems. 23,24

594

The current research highlighted that a clear and consistent definition of visual perception

595

should be provided to orthoptists and occupational therapists. More training is needed on

596

the assessment (and management) of visual perceptual screening. This is preferably

597

provided via professional organisations to ensure consistency. This will raise awareness and

598

reduce insecurity experienced by junior staff members. Establishing good relationships

599

between staff at stroke and eye departments is strongly recommended. We suggest this

600

could be achieved may in the form of knowledge exchanges or via a re-evaluation of the

601

existing referral system. Lastly, a quick and portable visual perception screening tool that is

602

easy to administer, score and interpret would highly benefit both staff and stroke survivors

603

if it is inclusive for stroke survivors with aphasia, motor impairments and cognitive

604

problems. The tool should be evidence-based and self-explanatory to use

605

Clinical Messages

606

•

607
608

There is a high demand for training on what visual perception deficits are and how to
screen for them.

•

Building local relationships between orthoptists and occupational therapists is

609

perceived as highly beneficial for providing good vision and visual perception care for

610

stroke survivors.

611

•

There is a need for a visual perception screening tool that is self-explanatory, quick,

612

portable, paper and pen based, accessible to stroke survivors with aphasia or low

613

concentration, and includes management advice.
