Prevalence and associated occupational factors for low back pain among the bank
employees in Dhaka City
Abstract
Objective: Low Back Pain (LBP) is one of the common health problems among full-time office
employees that causes employees absenteeism from work. The purpose of the study is to identify
the association between occupational factors and LBP among full-time bank employees in Dhaka
City.
Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 593 full-time bank
employees. The one-month complaints of LBP were administered by a musculoskeletal subscale
of subjective health complaints by Eriksen et al. A logistic model was performed to identify
variables associated with LBP, and a random forest technique was performed to identify the top 5
important variables.
Results: The one-month prevalence for LBP was found 36.6% among the bank employees and the
prevalence was high (46.6%) for the 41 to 59-year-old age-group. The multiple logistic regression
analysis indicates that age (41-59 years) (OR:2.11, CI=1.21-3.74), obesity (OR:2.06, CI=1.014.21) and long working hours (>9 hours) (OR:1.42, CI=1.01-2.0) are positively associated with
LBP. Age and length of employment have a positive correlation of 0.87. The random forest
technique identifies the top 5 important variables are, age, length of employment, long office
hours, presence of chronic illness, and physical activity.
Conclusion: LBP is highly prevalent in full-time bank employees. The occupational factors like
length of employment (>10 years) and long working hours (>9 hours) play a significant role in
developing LBP among the bank employees. Moreover, the factors like age, chronic illness,
obesity and physical activity should be taken into account in the prevention of LBP in bank
employees.

Background:
The global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study in 2016 suggested that among 328
morbidities, low back pain (LBP) became one of the most significant health concerns for any
population group [1]. Another study showed that the lifetime prevalence of LBP reached up to
84% [2]. LBP can induce a lack of enthusiasm, mental unrest, and physical discomfort or burden
on its bearer [3]. Consequently, LBP became a significant cause of taking sick leave and early
retirement among the working population [4].
Recently non-manual occupations made essential changes in our working life [5]. Office workers
spend a substantial amount of time sitting at a desk. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence
of LBP among office workers varies from 34% to 51% [6-8]. The prevalence of LBP in lowincome countries were found higher compared to high-income countries [9]. It is, therefore,
essential to explore the prevalence rate of LBP in Bangladeshi full-time office workers.
A study revealed that long-time sedentary work, high workload, and inappropriate sitting
arrangements are the contemporary causes of LBP [10]. Many studies conducted with office
workers found a relationship between sitting and LBP [6,11-15]. Another study suggested that the
associated factors of LBP for office workers were: long office hours, working in the same posture,
and continuing the same job for many years [3]. Furthermore, few studies revealed that prolonged
sitting was associated with metabolic disorders, sleep disturbance, hypertension, and high body
mass index (BMI) [16-17]. These factors are also positively associated with increased LBP [18].
Studies on work-related LBP in Bangladesh found high prevalence among different work settings.
For example, female garments workers (34.6%) [19] and professional female nurses (31.8%)
reported high prevalence of chronic LBP [20]. Another study conducted by Hossain et al. on workrelated musculoskeletal disorders found a 24.7% prevalence of LBP among garments workers of
both sexes [21]. However, there is a research gap in evaluating the effect of work-related factors
and low back pain in the growing number of full-time office employees in Bangladesh. Thus, this
study aims to determine the prevalence of LBP and find associated occupational factors among
office employees in Dhaka city.

Methods:
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in Dhaka City between December 2018 and May
2019. Dhaka is the capital city and economic hub of Bangladesh. We selected full-time bank
employees who maintained a regular office hour for at least one year at a bank. There are 50 banks
in Dhaka City, and we conveniently selected 32 banks to collect data from their full-time
employees. We included the employees who were working in the bank for the last year. Figure 1
represents the flow chart of the data collection. We distributed 923 paper-based questionnaires to
the employees during office hours, and we collected 652 questionnaires during the study period.
After scrutiny, we found 628 completed questionnaires. We excluded nourishing mothers,
pregnant women, and those who were bearing chronic inflammatory pain (e, g., rheumatoid
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis). We also excluded employees who were working while standing.
After taking into consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we took 593 participants in
our analysis.
Figure 1: Flow chart of the data collection.
Instruments:
The questions on LBP were based on the musculoskeletal subscale of subjective health complaints
produced by Eriksen et al. that measure LBP complaints experienced in the last month [22].
Employees were asked to rate the occurrence of pain or discomfort in the lower back with four
answering categories (“no complaint,” “only once/a little,” “of short duration/ some,” “frequently/
serious”). Employees who answered, “no complaint,” “only once/a little,” “of short duration/
some” on LBP were classified as having no low back pain. Those who answered
“frequently/serious” were classified as having complaints of LBP.
Data on socio-demographic factors- age, gender, BMI (calculated based on weight and height),
and marital status were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Behavioral factors like
sleep arrangements, smoking habits, and physical activities of the respondents were collected.
Physical activities were calculated based on the METs scale [23]. We also collected occupational
factors like length of employment and average daily working hours. The crowding was calculated
by dividing number of family members in the house by the number of bedrooms in the house. Data

regarding common chronic illness (Diabetes and Hypertension) from the employees were also
collected.
Result:
Univariate Analysis
Among the 593 respondents, there were 342 (57.7%) males and 251 (42.3%) females. The
descriptive statistic of the factors such as age, gender, BMI, marital status, crowding, and sleeping
habits, are described in Table-1. More than half of the participants (59.02%) were between 31 and
40 years of age, and about half of the employees were overweight or obese.
The one-month prevalence of the complaints about LBP is found to be 36.6% among the bank
employees. There was no difference in prevalence of LBP between the gender, but had influence
of age and body mass index. The results of the p-value from the chi-square statistic indicates that
age has a significant association with LBP. In this study, the majority of the participants were
married (83.8%), and more complaints of LBP from married employees were found compared to
unmarried participants. It is because more aged employees were married. Thus, to avoid the
collinearity in the multiple logistic regression model, we excluded marital status in the model. The
results indicate a high prevalence (48.4%) of LBP in the 41 to 59-year-old age group, indicating
that it is a common condition among older adults.
The behavioral and occupational factors of the participants, such as smoking habits, chronic
illness, physical activity, length of the employment in a bank (years), and average working hours
per day are described in Table 2. More than half of the participants (56.2%) maintained regular
office hours (8-9 hours) per day. However, those who continued extended office hours (spent more
than 9 hours in the office per day) complained more about LBP than the employees who maintained
regular office hours (41.5% and 32.7%, respectively).
A scatter plot is shown in Figure 2 to understand the relationship between age, length of the
employment, and complaints about LBP. The complaints about LBP also increased among fulltime employees, as the length of the employment in the bank increased. The correlation between
age and length of the employment in a bank is found 0.87, which indicates a high relationship.
Therefore, to avoid multicollinearity, we included age in the multiple logistic regression analysis

and excluded length of employment. Moreover, 46.6% of employees who had any chronic
condition reported suffering from LBP (p=0.009).
Figure 2: Scatter plot to understand the relationship between age, duration of the
employment in banks and complaints of LBP. It appears that most red dots are in the
bottom which indicates new and younger employees are complaining less about LBP.
Logistic Regression Model:
We fit a logistic regression model with the complaints of LBP after adjusting all the individual
associated factors from Table 1 and Table 2. It appears from Table 3 that there are three factors
associated with the complaints of LBP at 5% significance level. The three factors are: long
working hours per day (OR=1.42), older age group (OR=2.11), and BMI category- obese
(OR=2.06) were found to have an association with LBP. The results indicate that the bank
employees who work for an extended period are 1.42 times more likely to have the LBP than those
who work regular hours. Moreover, the age group of 41-59 years is 2.11 times more likely to have
LBP than those in age group of less than 30 years. Obesity (OR= 2.06) is found to be significant
in the development of LBP, which indicates an obese employee is 2.06 times more likely to have
LBP than an employee from a healthy-weight group.
Variables importance in Random forest model:
Here we interpret variables importance by applying a Random Forest model when predicting LBP.
There is a consensus that random forests rarely suffer from “overfitting,” which plagues many
other models [24]. We used mean decrease accuracy to assess random forests and to examine them
on the probability of affecting LBP. The result of the random forest model is displayed in Figure
3, which shows a mean decrease in accuracy for the factors. The overall accuracy by the training
data is 77.42%. It appears that the top 3 most important variables are: duration of employment,
age, and long working hours. Hence, occupational factors play an important role on the complaints
of LBP

Discussion:
The one-month prevalence of LBP among bank employees is 36.6%. Similar to our research, a
cross-sectional study conducted in Kigali, Rwanda, found that 45.8% of bank staffs reported LBP
during the one year [25]. Another study conducted in Nigeria found 12 months prevalence rate of
office workers was 38.0% [26]. A cross-sectional study conducted in Pakistan among office
workers found a 69.2% lifetime prevalence [27]. The one-year prevalence of LBP among
information technology professionals in India was 51% [8]. In Malaysia, 37% of office workers
experienced LBP in a year [28]. Among Thai university office workers, the three-months
prevalence of LBP was 52.8% [29]. Additionally, the twelve-month prevalence of LBP in
Australian adults and one-month period prevalence in the US general population was 67% and
39%, respectively [30-31]. Global point prevalence, one-month prevalence, and twelve-months
prevalence of LBP among the adult population were estimated 12%, 23%, 38%, respectively [32].
Thus, the prevalence of LBP varied from 12% to 69%, and it depends on the type of questionnaire
used, the period of prevalence, occupational provision, and lifestyle of the target population along
with the location of the study.
There are many risk factors identified among the employees. Age is a common and substantial
factor in developing LBP [33]. Our study found a higher number of older employees complained
LBP than younger employees. Marital status also plays a role in developing LBP. A study
conducted on the Iranian population also found similar results [34]. It may be because most married
people belong to an older age group and so they complain about LBP.
This study’s results showed that regularly maintaining a long office hour is positively associated
with increased complaints of LBP. A study conducted in Denmark also suggested that those
employees who spend more time sitting down at the office caught LBP at a higher rate than those
who spent less time in sitting positions at the office [35]. A similar finding was reported in another
study conducted among university employees in Qatar [3]. The bank employees who were
working for more than 10 years complained about LBP more than those who were working for
less than 5 years. Similarly, an increased prevalence of LBP was found for office workers with
many years of employment [17, 35-36].

We found that obesity has a strong association with the complaints of LBP. A meta-analysis also
reported that obesity was associated with an increased prevalence of LBP in the past 12 months
[37]. The gender difference was not evident in our study regarding the prevalence of complaining
low back pain among office employees. But a meta-analysis suggests the prevalence of low back
pain was stronger for women than for men [37]. Few studies suggest that regular physical activity
can reduce LBP [21, 38]. In our study, the results show an association between physical activity
and LBP at a 10% significance level, and the random forest method also identified the factor as an
important variable.
There are many strengths to this study. We described gaps in the complaints of LBP from full-time
bank employees. The study participants were homogenous because of their job nature, sitting
arrangement, and the environment of the bank office was almost the same. Limitations include the
self-reported data collected through study participant questionnaires. LBP differences observed in
this paper cannot be interpreted as causative because of the consideration of the cross-sectional
study design.

In a future goal, a multi-professional study may help determine the overall

generalizability of our results to the full-time employee as a whole.
Conclusion:
We found a high burden of low back pain among bank employees in Dhaka City. Studies revealed
that long working hours and many years of employment are associated with LBP. The study
showed a high prevalence in the 41 to 59-year-old age group, indicating that it is a common
condition among older adults. Moreover, our findings add to the evidence on the importance of
obesity about low back pain. Taking appropriate physical activity, taking a short break from the
sitting position at the office, and doing body stretching at the office could be a low-cost solution
for office workers.
