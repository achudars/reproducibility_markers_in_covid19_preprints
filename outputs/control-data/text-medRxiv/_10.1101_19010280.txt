Abstract:
Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric disease, characterized by the cycles of mania and depression. Several genetic
studies investigated BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism as risk factor for BPD, but results were inconclusive.
Therefore, present meta-analysis was performed to reevaluate the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPD
association. Four databases (Pubmed, Springer Link, Science Direct and Google Scholar) were searched for eligible
studies up to March 31,2018. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to
estimate the strength of the association. All statistical analyses were done by MetaAnalyst and Mix program. Forty
studies with a total of 28,787 subjects (10,085 cases and 18,702 controls) were included in this meta-analysis.
Overall, pooled analysis indicated that there was no significant association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism
and BPD risk under all five genetic models (ORA vs.G =0.99, 95%CI= 0.94-1.03, p=0.49; ORAG vs. GG= 0.1.02,
95%CI= 0.95-1.07, p= 0.57; ORAA vs. GG = 0.98, 95%CI=0.89-1.08, p=0.75; ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.0, 95%CI= 0.94-1.06,
p= 0.89;ORAA vs. AG+GG= 0.96, 95%CI= 0.89-1.05, p= 0.47). Similarly, no significant association was observed in
ethnicity based subgroup analysis in both Asian and Caucasian population. However, significant association was
found in subtype analysis between BDNF Val66Met and BPDII (ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.21, 95%CI= 1.06-1.37, p= 0.003)
but not with BPDI. These findings suggested that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism confer no genetic
susceptibility to BPD I but risk for BPDII.

Introduction:
Bipolar disorder (BPD) is one of the most common and severe psychiatric disorder, which is classified as a mood
disorder in the Diagnostic and statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM IV) (American Psychiatric
Association,2000). World Health Organization has identified BPD as the sixth leading cause of disability in the
world(WHO,2004). The lifetime prevalence of BPD is estimated to be between 1% and 2% (Kessler et al.,1994;
Merikangas et al.,2007). The disorder is characterized by episodes of mania, with elated or irritable-angry mood and
symptoms like pressured speech, racing thoughts, grandiose ideas, increased energy, and reckless behavior,
alternating with more normal periods and, in most cases, with episodes of depression. Although the etiologic
mechanisms for BPD are not well known, it has been hypothesized that both environmental and genetic factors play
important roles, and multiple genes contribute to risk of the disease (Hawton et al.,2005; Goodwin,20012).
BDNF is one of the most studied and abundant neurotrophin in central nervous system, which plays an important
role in a variety of neural processes. During, BDNF is essential for neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and neural
development pathways. In the adult, BDNF is important for synaptic plasticity, dendritic growth and long-term
memory consolidation (Post,2007). Because of the diverse functions of BDNF protein, BDNF gene is a good
candidate for the susceptibility to different neuropsychiatric disorders including BPD (Goldberg et al.,2008).
Several polymorphisms are reported in BDNF gene, but in exon 5 G to A (G196A) transition (dbSNP: rs6265) at
position 196 is most studied and clinically important. G196A polymorphism produces amino acid substitution of
valine (Val) to methionine (Met) at codon 66(Val66Met) in the 5′ prodomain in the BDNF protein (Cargill et
al.,1999). This substitution from valine (Val) to methionine (Met) at codon 66 has functional consequences (Egan
etal.,2003; Chen et al.,2006). The Met (A) allele of the precursor peptide has been associated with impaired
intracellular trafficking of pro-BDNF into dendrites and vesicles as well as a reduction inactivity-dependent
secretion, the process that plays a major role in the regulation of extracellular levels of BDNF (Egan etal.,2003;
Chen et al.,2006). The frequencies of the Val and Met alleles of BDNF Val66Met vary by ethnicity; about 80% of
the European population has Val allele while only 50% of Asian has it (Pivac et al.,2009). Numerous studies
investigated Val66Met polymorphism as a risk factor for BPD but results were inconclusive. Hence, authors
performed present meta-analysis to reevaluate the association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPD
risk.
Methods:
Meta-analysis was carried out according to Meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE)
guidelines (Stroup et al.,2000).

A literature search was performed for available articles that were published up to March 31, 2018 from the following
databases: (1) Pubmed; (2) Google Scholar; (3)Science Direct; and (4) Springer Link. The search used the following
keywords: ‘‘Bipolar Disorder’’ or ‘‘BPD’’ and ‘‘brain-derived neurotrophic factor’’ or ‘‘BDNF’’ and ‘‘Val66Met’’.
We also reviewed the bibliography of included articles to identify additional articles not retrieved by database
search.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
The following inclusion criteria were used: (i) studies should be original, (ii) used case control approach, and (iii)
used standard diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder patient diagnosis (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Studies were excluded if: (i) incomplete
raw data information like- number of genotype/allele, and (ii) studies based on pedigree data.
Data Extraction:
Relevant information were extracted from all selected studies like- first author's name, year of publication, country
name, ethnicity, sample size and number of cases and controls for BDNF Val66Met genotypes (GG, AG and AA).
Mutant allele frequencies for the cases and controls were calculated from corresponding genotypes. Allele frequency
was calculated by simple gene count method.
Statistical analysis:
The present meta-analysis examined the overall association of Met allele with the risk of bipolar disorder. Pooled
odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as association measure, which was estimated either by
fixed effect (Mantel and Haenszel,1959) or random effect (DerSimonian and Laird,1968) models depending upon
heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was tested by Q-statistics and quantified by the I2 statistic (Higgins and
Thompson,2002). If I2 > 50% then random effect model was used (Whitehead,2002). Genetic models were chosen
according to the method of Thakkinstian et al. (2005),, briefly calculating and comparing the ORs of A(Met) vs. G
(Val) (allele contrast), AA(Met/Met) vs. GG(Val/Val) (homozygote), AG(Met/Val) vs. GG(Val/Val) (co-dominant),
AA(Met/Met) + AG(Met/Val) vs. GG (Val/Val) (dominant) and AA(Met/Met) vs. AG(Met/Val) + GG(Val/Val)
(recessive) models. We have also done sub-group analysis based on ethnicity and subtypes of bipolar disorder like
BPDI and BPDII. In allele contrast meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis performed by exclusion of the studies in
which control population was not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and studies with small sample size.
Publication bias:
Publication bias was investigated by funnel plots; viz. funnel plot of standard error by log odds ratio and funnel plot
of precision (1/standard error) by log odds ratio. Different statistical tests such as Begg and Mazumdar rank
correlation (Begg and Mazumdar,1994) and Egger’s regression intercept (Egger et al.,1997) were adopted to assess
the publication bias. All p values were two tailed with a significance level at 0.05. All statistical analyses were
undertaken using program MetaAnalyst (Wallace et al.,2013) and MIX version 1.7 (Bax eta al.,2006).
Results:
Characteristics of included studies:
The study search workflow was shown in Figure 1. The preliminary search resulted in 187 publications from
Pubmed, Springer Link, Science Direct and Google Scholar. Out of which 104 articles were excluded after title and
abstract reading. Again 23 articles including review, letter to editors and comment were excluded from remaining 83
articles. Further 26 articles, which were duplicate studied , studies without genotype or allele number, studies on
animal models, were excluded. Out of 34 remaining articles, 3 articles were meta-analysis, and excluded.. Thus,
total thirty studies that investigated the association of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with BPD were found
suitable for the inclusion in the present meta-analysis (Hong et al.,2003; Nakata et al., 2003; Kunugi et al., 2004;
Oswald et al.,2004; Skibinska et al.,2004; Lohoff et al., 2004; Nerves-Pereira et al., 2005,2011; Schumacher et al.,

al., 2014; Kenna et al., 2014; Nassan et al., 2015; Morales-Marín et al., 2016). In nine articles, authors (Nakata et
al.,2003; Kunugi et al., 2004; Green et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Lee et al.,
2012; Chang et al., 2013; Kenna et al., 2014) investigated subtypes of bipolar disorder like BPDI and BPD II. We
included each case sample group (BPD I and BPD II case samples) as separate article so total forty article were
included in the present meta-analysis (Table 1).
In forty included studies, the smallest case sample size was 26 (Kenne et al., 2014) and highest sample size was 864
(Green et al., 2006). In included studies, total cases and controls were 10,085 and 18,702 respectively . In controls
genotype percentage of GG, AG and AA were 47.73%, 40.09% and 12.18% respectively. In cases genotype
percentage of GG, AG and AA were 52.63%, 36.59% and 10.23% respectively. Control population of three studies
(Nerves-Pereira et al.,2011; Wang et al.,2012; Lee et al.,2013) was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table 1).
Case and control subjects were selected from following countries- Brazil (Tramontina et al., 2007; Nerves et al.,
2011), Bulgaria (Oswald et al.,2004), China (Hong et al.,2003; Liu et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009;

Meta-analysis:
Meta-analysis with allele contrast (A (Met) vs. G(Val)) showed no association with both fixed effect (ORA vs.G
=0.99, 95%CI= 0.94-1.03, p=0.49) and random effect model (ORA vs.G =0.98, 95%CI= 0.93-1.03, p=0.46)(Table 2;
Figure 2). Significant association was not found between BPD and mutant genotype (AA vs. GG; homozygote
model) with both fixed (ORAA vs. GG = 0.98, 95%CI=0.89-1.08, p=0.75) and random (ORAA vs. GG =0.98 ,
95%CI=0.87-1.10, p=0.74) effect models (Table 2; Figure 2). Mutant heterozygous genotype (AG vs.GG; codominant model) meta-analysis did not show any significant association with BPD using fixed (ORAG vs. GG= 0.1.02,
95%CI= 0.95-1.07, p= 0.57) and random (ORAG vs. GG= 1.02, 95%CI= 0.93-1.13, p= 0.56) effect models (Table 2).
Combined mutant genotypes (AA+AG vs. GG; dominant model) meta-analysis showed negative association with
BPD using both fixed (ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.0, 95%CI= 0.94-1.06, p= 0.89) and random (ORAA+AG vs. GG=1.0, 95%CI=
0.92-1.09, p= 0.86) effect models. Similarly the recessive genotypes model (AA vs. AG+GG) also did not show any
association fixed (ORAA vs. AG+GG= 0.96, 95%CI= 0.89-1.05, p= 0.47) and random (ORAA vs. AG+GG= 0.96, 95%CI=
0.86-1.06, p= 0.45) effect models (Table 2).
Subgroup analysis:
Out of 40 studies included in the present meta-analysis, 21 studies were carried out on Asian subjects, and 19 studies
were carried out on Caucasian population. The subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed that no significant
association existed between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPD in Asian population (OR A vs.G = 1.02,
95%CI= 096-1.07., p=0.47; co-dominant model-ORAG vs. GG= 1.08, 95%CI= 0.99-1.18, p= 0.07; homozygote modelORAA vs. GG = 1.05, 95%CI=094-1.17., p=0.34; dominant model- ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.07, 95%CI= 0.0.98-1.16, p= 0.09;
recessive model-ORAA vs. AG+GG= 1.01, 95%CI= 0.92-1.11, p= 0.79) (Table 3, Figure 3). Similarly in Caucasian
subgroup analysis, heterogeneity was low and except allele contrast model, significant association was not found
between C677T polymorphism and BC risk (OR A vs.G =0.93, 95%CI= 0.87-0.99, p=003.; co-dominant model-ORAG
vs. GG= 0.96, 95%CI= 0.89-1.04, p= 0.34; homozygote model- ORAA vs. GG = 0.80, 95%CI=0.65-0.98, p=0.03;
dominant model- ORAA+AG vs. GG=0.94, 95%CI= 0.87-1.02, p= 0.14; recessive model-ORAA vs. AG+GG= 0.79 , 95%CI=
0.65-0.95, p= 0.02) (Table 3,Figure 4).
Subgroup analysis based on subtypes of BPD like BPD I and BPDII was also performer. Out of 40 studied, in 12
studies cases were of BPD I and in 10 studies, authors selected BPD II cases for their analysis. In other studies, type
of bipolar disorder was not mentioned, so we grouped them in one subgroup (BPD subgroup). Meta-analysis of
BPD I studies did not show any association between Val66Met and BPD I (ORA vs.G =0.98, 95%CI= 0.93-1.06,
p=0.95; co-dominant model-ORAG vs. GG= 0.93, 95%CI= 0.85-1.02, p= 0.16; homozygote model- ORAA vs. GG = 1.06,
95%CI=0.0.91, p=0.43; dominant model- ORAA+AG vs. GG=0.95, 95%CI= 0.83-1.04, p= 0.26; recessive model-ORAA
vs. AG+GG=1.08 , 95%CI= 0.0.94-1.20, p= 0.23) (Table 3). Meta-analysis of BPD II studies showed significant
association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPDII except recessive model (ORA vs.G = 1.10, 95%CI=
1.01, p=0.04; co-dominant model-ORAG vs. GG= 1.31, 95%CI= 1.06-1.60, p= 0.03; homozygote model- ORAA vs. GG
=1.11 , 95%CI= 1.01-1.23, p=0.03; dominant model- ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.21, 95%CI= 1.06-1.37, p= 0003; recessive
model-ORAA vs. AG+GG=0.96 , 95%CI= 0.83-1.12, p= 0.06) (Table 3).
Again subgroup BPD meta-analysis did not show any association between Val66Met polymorphism and BPD (ORA
vs.G =0.95, 95%CI= 0.89-1.02, p=0.24; co-dominant model-ORAG vs. GG= 1.02, 95%CI= 0.93-1.12, p= 0.63;
homozygote model- ORAA vs. GG = 0.82 , 95%CI=0.68-0.98, p=0.03; dominant model- ORAA+AG vs. GG=0.99, 95%CI=
0.90-1.08, p= 0.88; recessive model-ORAA vs. AG+GG=82 , 95%CI= 0.70-0.96, p= 0.02) (Table 3).
Heterogeneity and Sensitivity analysis:
Between studies heterogeneity existed moderate heterogeneity in allele contrast (Pheterogeneity =0.02, I2= 34.64), high
heterogeneity in co-dominant (Pheterogeneity <0.0001, I2= 54.68), insignificant low heterogeneity in homozygote
(Pheterogeneity =0.13, I2= 20.43), moderate heterogeneity in dominant (Pheterogeneity =0.0007, I2= 46.83) and low
heterogeneity in recessive (Pheterogeneity =0.09, I2= 23.92) comparisons (Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis was performed by eliminating studies with small sample size (<100) and control population
deviating from HWE. Control population of three studies was not in HWE (Nerves-Pereira et al.,2011; Wang et
al.,2012; Lee et al.,2013) and heterogeneity was not decreased after exclusion of these studies (I2= 34.4%; p=0.02).
Sample size of six studies was less than 100 (Nakata et al.,2003; Green et al.,2006; Xu et al.,2009;Wang et al.,2012;
Kenna et al.,2014; Marin et al.,2016) and after exclusion of these studies heterogeneity was decreased (I 2= 34.5%;
p= 0.027) .

Funnel plots and Egger's test were performed to estimate the risk of publication bias. Except recessive model,
publication bias was absent (A vs. G: P Egger’s test= 0.09; AG vs. GG: P Egger’s test= 0.49; AA vs. GG: P Egger’s test P=
0.05; Dominant model AA+AG vs. GG: P Egger’s test= 0.81; Recessive model AA vs. AG+GG: P Egger’s test= 0.02).
Discussion:
Forty case–control studies with 10,085 bipolar disorder cases and 18,702 controls were included in the present metaanalysis. The results of current meta-analysis indicated that the Met (A) allele of BDNF was not associated with
risk of BPD. Further, subgroup analyses based on ethnicity also did not show any association between BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism and BPD in Asian as well as Caucasian populations. However, subgroup analysis based
on BPD subtypes showed significant association with BPD II (ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.21, 95%CI= 1.06-1.37, p= 0003)
but not with BPD I. Although several evidences supported that BDNF factor is involved in BPD pathophysiology
like- (i) reduced BDNF levels have been observed in patients with BPD during manic and depressive episodes and
these levels have normalized with episode recovery (Cunha et al.,2006; Lin,2009), (ii) post-mortem studies have
also demonstrated decreased hippocampal BDNF in patients with BPD (Knable et al.,2004; Dunham et al.,2009),
(iii) use of antidepressants and mood stabilizers, e.g. lithium and valproate, to induce expression of neurotrophins
(e.g., BDNF) and synaptic changes (Duman et al.,2000) and (iv) modulation of antidepressant-like affects by BDNF
genotype and expression was also reported in human studies (Colle et al.,2015; Polyakova et al.,2015). Possible
explanation for the lack of association between the Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism and BPD in present metaanalysis may be due to (i) small sample size in included genetic association studies, (ii) different clinical criteria for
selecting BPD patients and (iii) BDNF factor level decreases in subtype BPD II but not in BPD I.
Meta-analysis is an acceptable powerful statistical tool which is used effectively to combine data from several
similar case control studies to obtain reliable results. During past two decades, numerous meta-analysis were
published which evaluated genetic polymorphism as risk factor for different diseases and disorders- likeschizophrenia (Yadav et al., 2016; Rai et al.,2017), depression (Rai,2014), autism (Rai, 2016; Rai and Kumar,2018),
Glucose 6-phosphate deficiency (Kumar et al.,2016), hyperuricemia (Rai, 2016), cleft lip and palate
(Rai,2014,2017), male infertility (Rai and Kumar,2017), Down syndrome (Rai,2011; Rai et al., 2017; Rai and
Kumar,2018), epilepsy (Rai and Kumar, 2018), Uterine Leiomyoma (Kumar and Rai, 2018), recurrent pregnancy
loss (Rai, 2016), breast cancer (Rai,2014; Rai et al.,2017), digestive tract cancer (Yadav et al.,2018), colorectal
cancer (Rai, 2015), esophageal cancer (Kumar and Rai,2018), ovary cancer (Rai,2016), and prostate cancer (Yadav
et al., 2016) and endometrial cancer (Kumar and Rai,2018) etc.
Despite the clear strengths of present meta-analysis, including relatively large sample sizes and lack of publication
bias, the interpretation of results should be done in light of few limitations like-(i) crude ORs without adjustment
was used as association measure, adjusted analysis could not be done due to lack of sufficient raw data about related
risk factors like substance abuse, alcohol intake etc., (ii) significant heterogeneity was observed in overall metaanalysis,(iii) single gene polymorphism was considered, and (iv) gene–environment interactions were not
considered.
Conclusions:
We performed present meta-analysis to find out association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and bipolar
disorder susceptibility. The results of present meta-analysis reported that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is not
risk factor for bipolar disorder (ORA vs.G =0.99, 95%CI= 0.94-1.03, p=0.49). According to DSM IV bipolar disorder
is a heterogeneous disease with many subtypes -BPD I, BPD II etc and results or present study also showed that
BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD by influencing the susceptibility of
specific subtypes such as BP II (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.06-1.37, p=0.003). Further in subgroup analysis showed no
association between Val66Met polymorphism and bipolar disorder risk either from Asian or Caucasian population.
In future , studies with larger sample sizes from different ethnic population are required to reach a definitive
conclusion regarding this association. Also, it is necessary to take into consideration different inheritance patterns
and the interaction of the BDNF gene with the environment.
