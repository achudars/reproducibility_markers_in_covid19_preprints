Abstract
Background: Elevated heart rate (HR) is associated with accelerated mortality and
independently predicts poorer outcomes in patients discharged from hospital after myocardial
infarction and/or heart failure. We examined whether resting HR measured within 24 hours
of hospital discharge following elective non-cardiac surgery was elevated compared to
preoperative values. We also investigated the relationship between changes in HR with
and/or autonomic function associated with morbidity after surgery.
Methods: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of HR data obtained in a prospective
observational cohort study of patients >18years in whom serial Holter-based measurements
of cardiac autonomic activity were made before, and for 48h after, surgery. The primary
outcome was absolute discharge HR (beats minute-1), recorded at rest before hospital
discharge. We examined the association between quartiles of discharge HR and autonomic
measures (time/frequency domain heart rate variability) associated with morbidity (defined
by Postoperative morbidity survey).
Results: In 157 patients (66 (42%) male; age 67(9) years), HR at hospital discharge (range:
53-122) increased by 5 beats minute-1 (95%CI:3–7;p<0.001) compared to preoperative
values. Patients in the upper quartile of discharge HR (≥85bpm) were more likely to sustain
pulmonary (odds ratio (OR):2.18 (95%CI:1.07-4.44);p=0.03) and infectious (OR:2.31
(95%CI:1.13-4.75);p=0.02) morbidity within seven days of surgery, compared to lower
quartiles. Pulmonary/infectious morbidity was associated with loss of cardiac vagal activity.
Conclusions: Heart rate on discharge from hospital following major elective non-cardiac
surgery is frequently elevated and is promoted by morbidity associated with reductions in
cardiac vagal activity.

Introduction
In mammals, there is an inverse semilogarithmic relation between heart rate and life
expectancy suggesting that for each species, there is a predetermined number of heart beats in
a lifetime (1). Elevated heart rate is a consistent, robust predictor of morbidity and mortality,
including in otherwise healthy individuals (2). Several prospective studies have identified
higher heart rate at discharge from hospital as an independent prognostic predictor of
morbidity and mortality in patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (3,4,5), and heart
failure (2,6). For every 10 beats minute-1 (bpm) increase in heart rate, mortality increases by
16% in patients with heart failure (7). Before non-cardiac surgery, resting heart rate >87 beats
minute-1 is associated with myocardial injury and poorer outcome (8,9).
A prototypical feature of the surgical stress response is loss of cardiac vagal activity,
leading to higher resting heart rate (10). However, it is unknown whether increases in
perioperative heart rate persist beyond the first 72h after non-cardiac surgery. If so, heart rate
may be an overlooked modifiable risk factor for morbidity and/or mortality after discharge
from hospital following surgery. Here, we hypothesised that elevation in resting heart rate
after surgery persists until at least discharge from hospital. We performed a post-hoc analysis
of a single-centre observational cohort study of non-cardiac surgical patients to determine
whether cardiac vagal function and/or morbidity after surgery were associated with higher
heart rate at the time of discharge from hospital.

Methods
Study design
This was a post-hoc analysis of a single-centre, prospective, observational mechanistic cohort
study conducted at University College London Hospital. The study protocol was approved by
a research ethics committee (MREC:16/LO/06/35) and conformed to the principles of the
Helsinki declaration and the Research Governance Framework. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants for the collection of routinely collected clinical data prior
to surgery. The Strengthening and Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) guidelines (11) (STROBE statement in Supplementary Material) were followed.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients aged >18 years undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia,
regional anaesthesia, or both with a planned overnight stay in hospital were eligible for
recruitment, provided they satisfied the following criteria: American Society Anaesthesiology
(ASA) score ≥3, major surgery with expected surgical operating time ≥ 120 minutes.
Patients with atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias, (including permanent or temporary
pacemaker in-situ), on discharge or day of surgery, or who refused consent, were excluded.

Heart rate measurement
Resting preoperative heart rate values were measured once in the sitting position as part of
the patients’ routine pre-assessment clinic visit (Carescape V100 Dinamap Vital Signs
Monitor, GE Healthcare, UK). On the morning of surgery, continuous three lead
electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were made in a quiet temperature-controlled room.
Resting preoperative heart rate values were measured again as the mean heart rate during this

recording. These measurements were repeated at 24 hours and 48 hours after surgery at the
same time of day. Resting discharge heart rate was measured within 24h of discharge in the
sitting position by nursing staff (Carescape V100 Dinamap Vital Signs Monitor, GE
Healthcare, UK) and recorded on National Early Warning Score observation charts. Three
lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were made at a sampling rate of 1024Hz (Lifecard
CF digital Holter monitors, Spacelabs Healthcare, Hertford, UK).

Assessment of cardiac autonomic activity- time and frequency domain measures.
R-R intervals from ECG data were captured using Kubios heart rate variability (HRV)
Premium software Version 3.1.0 (Kubios, Kuopio, Finland), as described previously (12).
Holter data cleaning and analyses were performed blinded to perioperative data and
outcomes. HRV analysis was performed for five-minute segments according to Taskforce
guidelines (13). Serial measurements of cardiac autonomic activity were quantified by wellestablished measures of autonomic control of heart rate; time domain, frequency domain and
orthostatic modulation of heart rate (further detailed methodology in Supplementary
Material). We used the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of the successive
differences between adjacent beat-to beat intervals (RMSSD) and Standard Deviation of the
N-N interval (SDNN) as time domain measures.

We also analysed frequency domain

measures, using high frequency (0.15-0.4Hz) power spectral analysis of R-R interval time
series as a measure of cardiac parasympathetic activity. Low frequency (0.04-0.15Hz) power
spectral analysis was also assessed as a measure of arterial baroreflex activity.

Log

transformation of these measures was performed.

Perioperative management
Consultant doctors performed surgery and anaesthesia, and intraoperative management was
of the usual standard of care. Postoperative care was performed as per the local enhanced
recovery programme guidelines. All clinicians were blinded to Holter data and outcomes.

Baseline characteristics
Baseline data were obtained through chart abstraction and standardized interviews by trained
hospital research staff at the first preoperative encounter, discharge and most recent
postoperative encounter. The baseline characteristics recorded are detailed in the CRF
(Supplementary data):

Postoperative morbidity
Postoperative morbidity was recorded using the Postoperative Morbidity Survey (POMS),
which is an 18-item survey that investigates nine domains of postoperative morbidity
(Supplementary Table 1) (14).

Exposure of interest
The exposure of interest was the absolute heart rate value. Resting preoperative heart rate was
defined as the heart rate value taken during the preoperative assessment clinic visit.

Primary outcome: The primary outcome was the absolute resting heart rate within 24 hours
of discharge from hospital.

Secondary analyses: We also quantified the absolute change in resting heart rate from
preoperative to within 24 hours of discharge for each patient and the proportion of patients
with resting heart rate >87bpm.

Explanatory analyses
The associations between clinical characteristics before surgery, morbidity, autonomic
function and heart rate changes from preoperative values outcomes were investigated.

Statistical analysis
Normally distributed continuous data are presented as mean (standard deviation) and
compared using the paired t-test, repeated measures or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), as indicated in the text. Skewed data are presented as median (interquartile range)
and compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Categorical data are presented as
numerical values and compared using Chi-square tests. For explanatory analyses of morbidity
after surgery, quartiles of absolute discharge heart rate were compared. Multivariable
regression analysis explored the relationship between discharge heart rate and perioperative
factors that may influence heart rate, including age, sex, body-mass index, preoperative heart
rate, Revised Cardiac Risk Index, frequency-domain measures of heart rate variability and
postoperative morbidity. Two-sided P values <0.05 were considered significant. All statistical
analyses were performed with NCSS 11 (Kaysville, Utah USA).

Sample size calculation
To detect a mean (SD) increase in resting heart rate at discharge of 10 (5) beats minute-1,
compared to preoperative heart rate, at least 73 patients would be required (1-β=0.1; α=0.05).

Secondary outcomes: heart rate changes from preoperative values.
At hospital discharge, mean heart rate was 5 beats minute-1 (95%CI:3-7) higher, compared to
heart rate values recorded at pre-assessment clinic (P<0.001, by paired t-test). Heart rate
changes from preoperative assessment values ranged from 28 beats minute-1 lower, to 39
beats minute-1 higher, at the time of discharge from hospital (Figure 2). Qualitatively similar
results were seen when we compared preoperative heart rate on the day of surgery, recorded
by Holter monitoring (mean heart rate difference: 11 beats minute-1 (95%CI:9-13); P<0.001).
Mean preoperative heart rate in patients in the upper quartile of discharge heart rate
(85 (95%CI:82-88)) was 9 beats minute-1 higher (95%CI:2-16); P<0.001), compared to the
other three quartiles (Figure 2A). Patients with a resting discharge heart rate >87bpm had a
higher preoperative heart rate (84 beats minute1 (95%ci: 3-12); p=0.001), but also sustained a
greater increase in heart rate after surgery (+11 beats minute-1 (95% ci:7-15); p<0.0001),
compared to patients with a discharge heart rate <87bpm (Figure 2B).

Discharge heart rate and morbidity within first 7 days of surgery
Patients in the upper quartile of discharge heart rate (>87bpm) were more likely to sustain
pulmonary (OR:2.18 (95%CI:1.07-4.44); p=0.03), and infectious (OR:2.31 (95%CI:1.134.75); p=0.02) morbidity within seven days of surgery, compared to lower quartiles (Table 2).
A similar incidence of myocardial injury (OR:1.17 (95%CI:0.52-2.65); p=0.68) and POMSdefined cardiovascular morbidity (OR:1.01 (95%CI:0.45-2.26); p=0.68) was observed
between patients in the upper quartile of discharge heart rate (>87bpm), compared to lower
quartiles. Patients in the upper quartile of discharge heart rate (>87bpm) stayed in hospital for
longer after surgery (Supplementary data).

Cardiac autonomic function.
Heart rate was similar between patients who sustained, or avoided, early pulmonary and/or
infectious morbidity (Figure 3A-C). Time-domain HRV analysis revealed lower SDNN in
patients who sustained pulmonary and infectious morbidity within 5 days of undergoing
surgery (Figure 3D-F). Analysis of frequency-domain measures revealed that both lnLF
(p=0.02) and lnHF (p=0.03) were reduced in patients who sustained pulmonary and
infectious POMS-defined complications after surgery (Figure 3G-J).

Multivariable analysis of discharge heart rate
Older age (OR:1.07 (95%CI:1.02-1.13); p=0.01) and lower preoperative heart rate (OR:0.89
(95%CI:0.86-0.94); p<0.001) were independently associated with the highest heart rate
quartile at discharge, accounting for resumption of beta-blockade before leaving hospital,
morbidity after surgery, Revised Cardiac Risk Index and perioperative changes in cardiac
autonomic control (Supplementary data)

Discussion
We found that resting heart rate within 24h of discharge from hospital following major noncardiac surgery was frequently elevated, compared to resting preoperative values. The most
elevated discharge heart rate was associated with higher preoperative heart rate and cardiac
vagal tone, as reflected by low frequency-domain fast fourier transform analysis. There was
no association between use of beta/calcium channel blocking agents at discharge. Given the
well-established and mechanistically robust association between heart rate and development
of cardiovascular (and extra-cardiovascular) pathology, discharge heart rate appears to be a
plausible modifiable risk factor for delayed recovery after noncardiac surgery.
Discharge heart rate is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in
different populations treated for acute myocardial infarction (3,4,5), and heart failure (2,6).
Patients with myocardial infarction and left ventricular failure have demonstrated an
independent association between resting heart rate and risk of overall mortality during 10year follow-up (16). This notion is supported by a study of patients treated for ST-elevation
myocardial infarction patients by primary PCI, in which the association between elevated
discharge heart rate and increased 4-year mortality was independent of myocardial infarction
size and/or the development of heart failure (4). Elevated heart rate increases myocardial

oxygen consumption (17), and reduces diastolic filling time (and hence coronary perfusion)
(18). Raised heart rate also augments atherosclerosis severity and progression in experimental
models, with patients at higher risk of coronary plaque rupture (19). heart rate reduction has
attenuated atherosclerosis progression in experimental models, suggesting that therapeutic
heart rate reduction may improve endothelial function and confer cardioprotective effects
(20). Other proposed pathophysiological consequences of elevated heart rate include reduced
development of collaterals vessels and increased arterial rigidity (20). These processes may
subsequently lead to left ventricular dysfunction and a higher incidence of arrhythmias
(21,22), contributing to non-cardiac and cardiac morbidity and mortality. The randomized
placebo-controlled Systolic Heart failure treatment with the If inhibitor ivabradine (SHIFT)
trial investigated the association between heart rate and cardiovascular events in heart failure,
by treating a chronic heart failure patient population with the selective heart-rate-lowering
agent ivabradine versus placebo. Selective heart rate reduction with ivabradine lowered the
risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.(23) This indicates that heart rate greatly contributes
to the progression of heart failure, suggesting that heart rate reduction should be a key
therapeutic target (24).
Major surgery may result in elevated heart rate even in the absence of key stimuli for
chemoreceptor-driven

cardiovascular responses,

evoked by postoperative

hypoxia,

hypercapnia and acidosis (25), which quickly alter heart rate variability (26). Our study
shows that elevated discharge heart rate after elective non-cardiac surgery is associated with
pulmonary and infectious morbidity after surgery.

This finding is consistent with a

modulatory role of inflammation on autonomic control. Activation of toll-like receptors
(TLRs) in the peripheral carotid chemoreceptors by inflammatory danger-associated

molecular patterns (DAMPs) stimulates chemoreceptor-driven autonomic responses
including tachycardia, even in the absence of hypoxia. (27)
Our exploratory analysis identified resting heart rate before surgery to be strongly
associated with higher discharge heart rate. Cardiac vagal tone is the main determinant of
resting heart rate. (28) From VISION studies, resting heart rate >87 beats minute-1 before
surgery is independently associated with myocardial injury.(8) A substantial number of
patients either entered surgery with heart rate>87 beats minute-1 or breached this prognostic
theart rateeshold by the time of discharge. Moreover, the mean heart rate value within the
highest heart rate quartile was ~87 beats minute-1, suggesting that patients discharged with an
elevated heart rate following major elective surgery may be at increased risk of subsequent
morbidity, including cardiovascular and thrombotic complications that occur for at least 12
months after noncardiac surgery.(29) Elevated discharge heart rate may therefore be a
modifiable risk factor for enhancing recovery after noncardiac surgery.
The main strength of this prospective study was the capture of both resting
preoperative and discharge heart rate values, although we acknowledge that time-weighted
measures are more likely to accurately reflect heart rate changes after surgery. Nevertheless,
patients and clinicians were blinded to perioperative data and outcomes, which included an
established tool to measure perioperative morbidity. Although heart rate was measured
objectively using Holter monitors, recordings were made within 72h of surgery and may
therefore not reflect changes in heart rate thereafter. We could not standardise how heart rate
was measured by clinical staff, although patients had heart rate recordings in the sitting
position. We cannot also control for diurnal variation in heart rate (30), although this may be
abolished in any event by systemic inflammation synonymous with surgery.

Conclusion
On discharge from hospital after major elective non-cardiac surgery, heart rate is elevated
compared to resting preoperative values. Higher discharge heart rate is associated with
prognostically relevant autonomic dysfunction before, and inflammatory morbidity after,
surgery. Targeting elevated heart rate at discharge from hospital, which is a modifiable risk
factor, may accelerate recovery after elective non-cardiac surgery.

Holter monitoring.
Processing Electrocardiogram recording.
Electrocardiogram recordings were made using the Lifecard CF digital Holter monitoring
(Spacelabs Healthcare, Hertford UK) with a sampling rate of 1024Hz. The recordings were
uploaded onto Sentinel V9 Cardiology information software system (Spacelabs Healthcare,
Hertford, UK) and *.ecg files were then exported and loaded onto Kubios 3.1 software. All
electrocardiogram recordings were visually inspected for quality of recording. 5 min (300s)
epochs were selected for heart rate variability analysis after 2.5 min resting time to minimise
movement artefact and to maximise a stationary time series.

R-R time series.
5 min R-R interval time series were generated using the Kubios software in-built QRS
detection algorithm. After visual inspection, missed beats were manually added and/or
incorrect beats deleted. Patients whose ECG recordings could not generate a R-R interval
times series due to no electrical recordings were excluded from further analysis.

Artefact detection and correction.
After manual correction, ECG recordings with artefact or ectopic beats were processed using
automatic artefact detection and correction where detected ectopic beats, or too long or short
beats are corrected by replacing the R-R interval times with interpolated values. To account
for slow non nonstationarities in the R-R interval detrending using smoothing priors λ = 500
was employed. The mean percentage of beats corrected per sample for this study was 1.8%.
Time series where the % artefact correction was >5% were excluded from the analysis
(unsuitable quality).

Heart rate variability- time domain analysis.
Time domain and frequency domain analyses were performed on 300s R-R time series using
Kubios 3.1 software after manual inspection +/- automatic correction. Statistical analyses
derived directly from the 300s R-R interval time series used in this study were:
Mean heart rate, Standard Deviation of the RR interval (SDNN) and Square root of the, mean
squared differences between successive RR intervals (RMSSD). SDNN has previously been
shown to be a predictor of mortality in chronic heart failure patients and post myocardial
infarction. RMSSD is a measure of short term variation and correlate with parasympathetic
modulation.

Heart rate variability - frequency domain analyses:
Cubic spline interpolating at the sampling rate 4Hz was used to convert the R-R time series
into an equidistant sampled series prior to spectrum estimation. Fast Fourier time spectrum
was calculated using Welch’s Perdiodogram method (window width 128s with 50% overlap).
The frequency bandwidths used were low frequency (LF) 0.04-0.15Hz and high frequency
0.15-0.4Hz. The frequency measures reflect autonomic modulation of heart rate variability.
Power spectral density of HF is strongly associated with parasympathetic modulation of the
heart. LF power spectral density has been shown to better correspond with baroreceptor
function rather than sympathetic function. The absolute power (ms2) values were natural log
transformed for statistical analysis.
