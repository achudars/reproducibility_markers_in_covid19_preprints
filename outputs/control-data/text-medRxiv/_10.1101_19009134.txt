Abstract

41

Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with

42

posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic experience, but the underlying

43

mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the association among CRP, PTSD, and traits

44

related to traumatic events and social support using genome-wide data from the

45

Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (30,000 cases and 170,000 controls), the UK

46

Biobank (UKB; up to 117,900 individuals), and the CHARGE study (Cohorts for Heart

47

and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology, 148,164 individual). Linkage

48

disequilibrium score regression, polygenic risk scoring, and two-sample Mendelian

49

randomization analyses were used to investigate genetic overlap and causal

50

relationships. Genetic correlations of CRP were observed with PTSD (rg=0.16,

51

p=0.026) and behavioral and emotional response to trauma, exposure to traumatic

52

events, and the presence of social support (-0.28<rg<0.20; p<0.008). We observed a

53

bidirectional association between CRP and PTSD (CRP→PTSD: β=0.065, p=0.015;

54

PTSD→CRP: β=0.008, p=0.009). CRP also showed a negative association on the “felt

55

loved as a child” trait (UKB, β=-0.017, p=0.008). Due to the known association of

56

socioeconomic status (SES) on PTSD and social support, a multivariable MR was

57

performed to investigate SES as potential mediator. We found that household income

58

(univariate MR: β=-0.22, p=1.57x10-7; multivariate MR: β=-0.17, p=0.005) and

59

deprivation index (univariate MR: β=0.38, p=1.63×10-9; multivariate MR: β=0.27,

60

p=0.016) were driving the causal estimates of “felt loved as a child” and CRP on PTSD.

61

The present findings highlight a bidirectional association between PTSD and CRP

62

levels, also suggesting a potential role of SES in the interplay between childhood

63

support and inflammatory processes with respect to PTSD risk.

Introduction

66

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric condition that can

67

occur after experiencing or witnessing traumatic events.1 Inflammatory processes,

68

reflected by blood-based markers like C-reactive protein (CRP), could be involved in

69

the biology of the trauma response and PTSD.2 CRP is a protein that responds to

70

inflammatory stimuli by triggering cellular reactions such as those related to

71

macrophage recruitment during inflammation initiation.3 Elevated levels of pro-

72

inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukins; a downstream product of CRP signaling) and

73

acute-phase proteins (e.g. CRP) have been observed in the blood of individuals with

74

PTSD.4,

75

inflammation with traumatic events and PTSD.6,7 Longitudinal studies reported

76

evidence supporting a bidirectional association: elevated inflammation may contribute

77

to PTSD and that PTSD contributes to elevated inflammation.8-13 Additionally, PTSD is

78

well-known to be associated with many chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases,

79

type-2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis) with an established inflammatory

80

component.14-16 Understanding the mechanisms underlying the PTSD-inflammation

81

association can potentially lead to important translational implications. If inflammation

82

is causal for PTSD, inflammatory markers may be useful in identifying persons at risk,

83

and anti-inflammatory treatments may be therapeutic. If PTSD causes inflammation,

84

this would provide evidence for one pathway via which PTSD increases risk of chronic

85

disease and may support screening for inflammation in persons with PTSD. A third

86

hypothesis is that the relation between inflammation and PTSD is not causal in either

87

direction but accounted for by a third factor.

5

Meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies have confirmed the association of

88

Analytic approaches based on large-scale genome-wide datasets may help us to

89

understand how inflammatory processes and CRP levels are related to etiology or

90

consequences of PTSD. Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used to investigate

91

causal relationships using genetic variants (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms –

92

SNPs) as instrumental variables in genetic epidemiologic experiments analogous to

93

randomized control trials.17-19 In this context, we investigated the genetic overlap and

94

the putative causal relationships linking CRP and PTSD, leveraging large-scale

95

genome-wide datasets from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium PTSD Workgroup

96

(PGC-PTSD), the UK Biobank (UKB), and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research

97

in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) study. To investigate more broadly the

98

relationship between trauma and inflammation, we also tested traits related to

99

behavioral and emotional response to trauma, exposure to traumatic events, and the

100

presence of social support. Additionally, since socioeconomic status has a well-

101

established relationship with the traits investigated (i.e., PTSD, CRP, traumatic events,

102

and social support),20-22 we tested whether the associations observed are independent

103

from the effects that are mediated by socioeconomic status (SES).

Materials and methods

106

Cohorts Investigated

107

Genome-wide association data for PTSD were obtained from PGC-PTSD using Freezes

108

1.5 and 2. PGC-PTSD Freeze 2 includes 23,185 cases and 151,309 controls of European

109

descent, including both PGC and UKB samples. PGC-PTSD Freeze 1.5 includes only

110

12,823 cases and 35,648 controls available from PGC samples (i.e., UKB samples were

111

not included in the Freeze 1.5 meta-analysis). We used the PGC-PTSD Freeze 1.5

112

dataset to exclude the potential bias induced by the overlap between PGC-PTSD Freeze

113

2 and UKB samples in the PRS and MR analyses. PTSD diagnosis across PGC-PTSD

114

cohorts was obtained considering different version of DSM criteria (DSM-III-R, DSM

115

IV, DSM-5). A detailed description of the QC criteria and GWAS methods was reported

116

previously.23

117

To investigate inflammatory processes, we used the genome-wide data generated

118

by the CHARGE Inflammation Working Group, which investigated the genetics of

119

circulatory CRP levels measured via standard laboratory techniques in up to 148,164

120

subjects of European ancestry.24

121

Additionally, we obtained GWAS summary association data related to trauma

122

traits, behavioral and emotional response to trauma, exposure to traumatic events, and

123

the presence of social support from the UK Biobank (UKB)25 included in the category

124

“traumatic events” (UKB Field ID: 145). These were assessed via the UKB online

125

mental health questionnaire (up to 118,000 individuals of European descent).26 In

126

addition, we investigated indicators of SES, considering “Average total household

127

income before tax” (UKB Field ID: 738, household income) and “Townsend

128

deprivation index at recruitment” (UKB Field ID: 189, deprivation index)

Heritability and Genetic Correlation

138

To estimate observed-scale SNP-heritability and genetic correlation among the

139

phenotypes interrogated in this project (PGC-PTSD Freeze 2, CRP, trauma traits, and

140

socioeconomic status traits), we performed Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression

(LDSC)

pipeline

described

previously

(available

28

143

We also calculated the heritability z-score, which is defined as the heritability

144

estimate produced by LDSC divided by its standard error. The heritability z-score is

145

able to capture information about the genetic architecture of a trait and the reliability of

146

each heritability estimate. As recommended by LDSC best practice, we conducted

147

genetic correlation analysis only using traits with heritability z-score>4.28 Genetic

148

correlations were adjusted for multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR),

149

considering Q < 0.05 as the significance threshold.

Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Definition of the Genetic Instruments
PRS

were

calculated

using

PRSice

v1.25

software

(available

http://prsice.info/)29 and considering the following parameters: clumping with a linkage

154

disequilibrium (LD) cutoff of R2 = 0.001, 10,000-kb as clumping window, and

155

exclusion of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region of the genome because of

156

its complex LD structure. European samples from the 1000 Genomes Project were used

157

as the LD reference panel.

158

To conduct this PRS analysis, we used GWAS summary data from the cohorts

159

described above (PGC-PTSD freeze 1.5 - to avoid sample overlap between PGC-PTSD

160

Freeze 2.0 and UKB). We applied FDR multiple testing correction to correct the p-value

for the number of PRS p-value thresholds tested at Q < 0.05.

analysis: inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode,

168

and weighted mode.30 These methods were considered to verify the stability of the

169

causal effects of MR results and the IVW approach was reported as the main results due

170

to its higher statistical power.31 The MR analysis was conducted in accordance with the

171

STROBE (STrenghtening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology) -

172

MR reporting guidelines.32

173

Multiple MR sensitivity tests were performed to investigate the presence of

174

horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity among the variants included within the genetic

175

instruments tested: MR-Egger regression intercept,33 MR-PRESSO (Pleiotropy

176

RESidual Sum and Outlier) global test),34 and MR heterogeneity test.35 Outliers

177

contributing to the heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy within the genetic

178

instruments were identified via a leave-one-out analysis and considering MR-RAPS

179

(MR–Robust Adjusted Profile Score)36 standardized residuals that fall outside the 95%

180

confidence level.

181

Multivariable MR (MVMR) was applied to estimate the effect of two or more

182

traits (risk factors) on a specific outcome (disease) using the multivariable IVW

approach available in the MendelianRandomization R package.37

Results

186

Genetic Correlation and Polygenic Risk Scores analyses

187

SNP-heritability was estimated for all traits investigated in this study and we

188

found that 4 trauma response traits, 12 trauma exposure traits, and 2 socioeconomic

189

status traits had heritability z-score>4 (Supplemental Table 2). We found a positive

190

genetic correlation between CRP and PTSD diagnosis (PGC-PTSD Freeze 2: rg=0.155,

191

p=0.026). After multiple testing correction (FDR at 5%), we observed significant

192

genetic correlation of CRP with seven traits related to behavioral and emotional

193

response to trauma, exposure to traumatic events, and the presence of social support

194

(Figure 1). Positive genetic correlation was also observed between CRP and

195

socioeconomic status: deprivation index, rg=0.20, p=3.38×10-5; household income, rg=-

196

0.25, p=4.08×10-10. The direction of the genetic correlations of CRP was in line with

197

expectations: positive genetic correlation with the presence of PTSD, traumatic events,

198

and deprivation index; negative genetic correlation with social support and household

199

income.

200

Considering our genetic correlation findings, we conducted bidirectional PRS

201

between CRP and trauma traits, PGC-PTSD Freeze 1.5 case-control status, and

202

socioeconomic traits. After FDR 5% correction for the number of PRS thresholds, we

203

found 12 significant associations (Table 1). The most significant PRS association was

204

observed between household income and CRP (R2=0.08%; FDR Q-value=7.45×10-25).

205
206

Mendelian randomization (MR)

207

Based on the PRS findings, we performed two-sample MR to assess the

208

causality among the traits. If heterogeneity or pleiotropy was identified within the

209

genetic instruments, we removed the outlier variants to verify that the causal estimates

210

were not generated by potential biases within the genetic instruments.

211

In our MR analysis, we found evidence supporting several causal relationships

212

among the traits investigated (Figure 2; Supplemental Table 3). Our results suggest a

213

bidirectional association between PTSD and CRP, where genetically determined CRP

214

levels have a causal effect on PTSD (β=0.065, 95% CI: 0.012 to 0.119, p=0.015), and

215

genetic liability to PTSD has a causal effect on CRP (β=0.008, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.015,

216

p=0.024). We observed the presence of possible heterogeneity in SNPs evaluated in the

217

PTSD CRP association (heterogeneity test p=0.001). However, after removal of the

218

outlier variants from the genetic instrument, the PTSD CRP association remained

219

significant (β=0.008, 95% CI: 0.002 to 0.015, p=0.009).

220

Among the traits related to traumatic events and social support, we observed that

221

CRP also has a negative causal effect on the “Felt loved as a child” trait from UKB (β=-

222

0.02, 95% CI: -0.034 to -0.007, p=0.003). However, strong evidence of heterogeneity

223

was present among the variants included in the genetic instrument (heterogeneity test

224

p=4.26×10-5). Removing the variants contributing to heterogeneity within the genetic

225

instrument, we confirmed the CRP-“Felt loved as a child” association (β=-0.017, 95%

226

CI: -0.031 to -0.004, p=0.008). “Felt loved as a child” trait showed a protective effect

227

on PTSD risk (β=-0.139, 95% CI: -0.206 to -0.071, p=5.64×10-6). However, the genetic

228

instrument was affected by heterogeneity (heterogeneity test p 0.002). Removing the

229

variants generating the heterogeneity within the genetic instrument, we confirmed the

230

protective effect of “Felt loved as a child” trait on PTSD (β=-0.19, 95%CI=-0.124 to -

231

0.257, p=2.1×10-8).

232

We also observed that indicators of SES affect both CRP levels and PTSD risk.

Household income showed a negative bidirectional association with CRP (household

235

income β=-0.016, 95%CI=-0.027 to -0.005, p=0.004). Both household income and

236

deprivation index have a causal effect on PTSD (Household income: β=-0.277, 95% CI:

237

-0.312 to -0.142, p=1.57×10-7; Deprivation index: β=0.389, 95% CI: 0.262 to 0.515,

238

p=1.63×10-9). The effects were confirmed also after removing outlier variants when

239

heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was observed within the genetic instruments

240

(Supplemental Table 3)

241

Finally, we performed a MVMR analysis to verify whether the causal effects

242

observed among PTSD, CRP, social support, and SES are independent from each other

243

(Figure 3). We confirmed that genetically determined CRP has causal effect on PTSD,

244

independently of the “Felt loved as a child” association (β=0.066, 95% CI: 0.007 to

245

0.126, p=0.029; Figure 3A). However, the CRP PTSD association (univariate MR

246

β=0.066, 95% CI=0.013 – 0.119, p=0.015; multivariate MR β=0.043, 95% CI=-0.027 –

247

0.113, p=0.232) was not independent from the effect of deprivation index (Deprivation

Discussion

254

We used genome-wide data to investigate the genetic overlap and the causal

255

mechanisms between CRP levels and PTSD, also considering the effects of SES,

256

traumatic experiences, and social support. Our findings indicate that there is

257

bidirectional association between PTSD and CRP levels, which appears to be strongly

258

affected by SES.

259

CRP is a protein that responds to inflammatory stimuli by triggering cellular

260

reactions and it is normally induced through pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly by

261

interleukin-6 secretion.38, 39 CRP may be produced in the microvessel endothelial cells

262

that form the blood-brain-barrier, and peripheral CRP can affect the central nervous

263

system via mechanisms of blood-brain barrier disruption associated with elevated levels

264

of peripheral inflammatory cytokines.40, 41 Higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines

265

may influence neurotransmission, leading to altered production of serotonin,

266

norepinephrine, dopamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This effect on levels

267

of neurotransmitters may be associated with specific psychiatric symptoms, such as

268

anhedonia.42 Furthermore, these cytokines may influence the neurocircuitry, causing

269

alterations in motivation status, and anxiety, arousal, and alarm response.43 Twin and

270

family studies estimated that heritability of CRP is around 35%-40%.24 Several

271

environmental factors, such as sociodemographic variables, dietary habits, behavioral

272

and lifestyle factors, are also strongly associated with CRP level.44 Previous cross-

273

sectional and longitudinal studies highlighted the presence of a bidirectional association

274

between PTSD and CRP levels.6-13 Our findings confirm this scenario. However, we

275

also observed that the CRP-PTSD association is not independent from SES (i.e. high

276

deprivation index and low household income). The effect of SES on CRP levels was

277

previously observed in studies highlighting the association of increased CRP levels with

278

low SES and traumatic childhood experiences.45 In addition, low SES has been

279

associated with DNA methylation of genes involved in inflammation, suggesting that

280

alterations in epigenetics of specific genes might influence the inflammation response

281

leading to increased inflammatory markers.46, 47

282

A recent GWAS of social stratification in Great Britain showed that genetic

283

factors related to socio-economic status (educational, income, employment) are

284

associated with a wide range of physical and mental health outcomes.48 Lower

285

economic status might be a mediator of the negative association between educational

286

attainment and PTSD.49 In line with these previous findings, we found that SES might

287

affect the interplay among inflammatory processes (i.e., CRP level), PTSD, and

288

childhood social support. This confirms that SES may affects several of the comorbid

289

traits associated with PTSD.

290

Furthermore, we found that “Felt loved as a child” was a protective factor with

291

respect to genetic liability to PTSD and CRP levels. Social support systems have been

292

considered as an important protective factor for mental health and well-being of

293

individuals, and refer to social interaction which involves love, care, respect, affection,

294

acceptance, and financial assistance.50,

295

perception and cognitive processes and consequently reduce the risk to develop

296

Although we present novel results contributing to understand the association

has investigated other inflammatory biomarkers. Further studies will be needed to verify

303

whether the same effects are present across inflammation-related molecules such as IL-

304

6. The analyses were conducted using GWAS in subjects of European ancestry, thus we

305

cannot generalize these results to other populations. The magnitude of estimates for the

306

effect of CRP on PTSD is relatively small, which may indicate a minor contribution of

307

the associations reported in the biology of PTSD. The genetic information about PTSD

308

and trauma traits were obtained across different cohorts, which may cause heterogeneity

309

in the outcomes related to stress exposition. The datasets investigated were generated

310

from participants assessed using different instruments, also including online

311

questionnaires. Although this approach was needed to collect information from a large

312

cohort and the online instruments were validated,26 this may have affected the quality of

313

the data collected.

314

In conclusion, this study is the first analysis leveraging large-scale genome-wide

315

datasets to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking CRP, PTSD, and traumatic

316

experiences. Our findings support a bidirectional association between PTSD and CRP,

317

which appears to be strongly affected by SES. Additionally, SES traits seem to also

318

mediate the interplay among CRP levels, PTSD, and childhood emotional support.
