Abstract
Objective: To investigate the relation between deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the
posterior-subthalamic-area (PSA) and the ventral-intermediate-nucleus (VIM) and the
distance to the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT) in essential tremor (ET).
Methods: Tremor rating scale (TRS) hemi-scores were analyzed in 13 ET patients,
stimulated in both the VIM and the PSA in a randomized, crossover trial. Distances of
PSA and VIM contacts to population-based DRTTs were calculated. The
relationships between distance to DRTT and stimulation amplitude, as well as DBS
efficiency (TRS improvement per amplitude) were investigated.
Results: PSA contacts were closer to the DRTT (p=0.019) and led to a greater
improvement in TRS hemi-scores (p=0.005) than VIM contacts. Proximity to the
DRTT was related to lower amplitudes (p<0.001) and higher DBS efficiency
(p=0.017).
Conclusions: Differences in tremor outcome and stimulation parameters between
contacts in the PSA and the VIM can be explained by their different distance to the
DRTT.

1 Introduction
Essential tremor (ET) is the most common adult movement disorder, causes
significant disability, interferes with activities of daily living, and reduces quality of life.
For medication-refractory cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral
intermediate nucleus (VIM) is an established, effective, and safe treatment.1-3
However, different groups have suggested that the posterior subthalamic area (PSA),
which also incorporates the caudal zona incerta, might be an even more promising
stereotactic target.4-6 In a recent prospective, randomized, double-blind crossover
trial, our group compared stimulation in the VIM, the traditional DBS target, to
stimulation in the PSA.7 PSA-DBS proved to be more efficient, yielding optimal
stimulation effects at lower amplitudes with at least equivalent tremor control, while
there was neither a quantitative nor qualitative difference in stimulation induced side
effects between the two targets. However, the underlying neuroanatomical correlate
remained unexplored.
DBS most likely modulates pathologic activity within the tremor network via
cerebello-thalamo-cortical connections, i.e. the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT).8
Direct targeting of the DRTT has been demonstrated to successfully control tremor9,
10

and effective contacts were located inside or close to the DRTT.8 However a direct

correlation between clinical outcomes and the distance to the DRTT has not yet been
proven.8,

11

We hypothesized that the observed differences between PSA and VIM

stimulation depend on the proximity of contacts to the DRTT.

2 Methods
2.1 Study design
Ethics approval (Local vote 12-116), study registration (German Clinical Trials
Register No. DRKS00004235), patient selection, implantation procedure and study
design have already been described in detail.7 In brief, 13 patients with
medication-refractory

ET

underwent

bilateral

stereotactic

lead

implantation.

Landmark-based targeting was used to place leads with one contact on the
intercommissural plane and at least one contact below in the PSA and one contact
above in the VIM. Three months postoperatively patients entered a randomized,
double-blind crossover to evaluate tremor improvement after two months of

PSA-DBS and after two months of VIM-DBS. Current-controlled stimulation was used
in all patients and stimulation pulse width was always set to 60 µs while frequencies
ranged from 130 Hz to 200 Hz.
2.2 Clinical outcome and lead reconstruction
Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) hemi-scores (part A+B) were obtained at preoperative
baseline, after two months of PSA-DBS, and after two months of VIM-DBS.7 For
further analysis we calculated the DBS efficiency by dividing the TRS improvement
from preoperative baseline by the stimulation amplitude (in mA). DBS leads were
identified from postoperative CT scans and lead locations were transformed into the
preoperative MRI using the Lead-DBS toolbox (www.lead-dbs.org).12
2.3 Average DRTT
Since the original study did not include individual diffusion imaging, we created one
population-based averaged DRTT per hemisphere from high-quality diffusion imaging
data

of

32

healthy

subjects

of

the

Human

Connectome

Project

(see

acknowledgments), which consisted of multi-shell diffusion (bvals=1000, 3000, 5000;
256 directions) and T1 images. Brain extraction of the b0-images was performed
using the BET-tool as implemented in the FMRIB software library (FSL) (FMRIB,
Oxford, UK) and distributions of diffusion vectors were estimated for each voxel using
BEDPOSTX.13 The number of fibers per voxel was set to three and diffusion
coefficients were modelled using a Gamma distribution.14 Probabilistic fiber tracking
was performed separately for each DRTT with PROBTRACKX2 using modified Euler
integration.13 For all other parameters the respective default settings were used. The
contralateral dentate nucleus was chosen as seed region, while the contralateral
superior cerebellar peduncle, the ipsilateral red nucleus, and the ipsilateral precentral
gyrus served as waypoints.8,

anatomical accuracy, leading to 62 DRTTs included for further analysis. Each
individual track frequency map was transformed into a track probability map
according to Schlaier et al.15 and transformed back to MNI space. Finally, probability

values per voxel were averaged over all subjects. The course of the populationbased average DRTTs was validated in another cohort of nine essential tremor
patients with individual diffusion imaging (see supplementary material).
Distance to average DRTT
For further analysis, the centers of gravity (COG) of each DRTT were calculated for
each transversal slice as

with xCOG/yCOG representing the coordinates of the COG, and mi representing the
probability value of each voxel i with its coordinates xi and yi in the respective slice.
The resulting coordinates were transformed from MNI space to the DBS patients’
individual T1 image via ANTs. Subsequently, the Euclidean distances between the
right and left hemispheric VIM and PSA contacts and the closest COG of the
respective average DRTT were calculated. The workflow is summarized in Figure 1.

Figure 1 – Workflow

Legend: Regions of interest (dentate nucleus=green, superior cerebellar peduncle, red nucleus=red,

diffusion space of each individual of the human connectome project dataset to perform probabilistic
tracking. The resulting individual DRTTs were transformed back to MNI space and averaged to create
one DRTT (lilac) per hemisphere. Finally the euclidean distance between each contact (grey dots) and
the respective DRTT’s closest center of gravity (red hotspot) was calculated in the respective patient
space. Abbreviations: DRTT=dentatorubrothalamic tract; HCP=Human Connectome Project;

2.4 Statistical analysis
TRS hemi-scores were analyzed with a linear mixed model for repeated
measurements to account for the crossover design and multiple measurements per
subject and per hemisphere.7 Differences in distance from the DRTT between PSA
and VIM contacts were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The
relationship between distance to the DRTT and stimulation amplitude (in mA) as well
as DBS efficiency were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models with the multiple
measurements per subject as random-effect. Results are reported as (adjusted)
mean values ± standard deviations. P-values p < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

3 Results
Patient demographics, disease characteristics at baseline, and differences in
stimulation parameters have been reported previously.7 Figure 2 illustrates the
contact locations in relation to the DRTT. The adjusted means revealed better tremor
suppression in the TRS hemi-score under PSA stimulation than under VIM
stimulation (p=0.005, PSA: 4.54 (±1.19), VIM: 6.77 (±1.22); Figure 3A). The distance
to the respective DRTT was shorter for PSA contacts (p=0.019, PSA: 2.13mm (±1.0),
VIM: 2.81mm (±1.46); Figure 3B). Furthermore, the distance to the respective DRTT
showed an effect on the stimulation amplitude (R²=0.73; p<0.001; Figure 3C) and on
the efficiency of the stimulation site (R²=0.44; p=0.017; Figure 3D) with shorter
distances indicating lower stimulation amplitudes and higher stimulation efficiency.

4 Discussion
This study demonstrates that the superior efficiency of PSA contacts in comparison
to VIM contacts is related to their proximity to the DRTT. Distances to the center of
the DRTT were significantly shorter in the PSA and this proximity lead to lower
stimulation amplitudes and higher stimulation efficiency. So far, the evidence for a
relation between stimulation of the DRTT and tremor improvement remained
inconclusive.8, 11 One possible reason might be that the stimulation amplitude has not
been considered as a crucial factor. While proximity to the DRTT seems to allow
tremor control at low stimulation amplitudes, contacts farther from the DRTT could
still achieve similar effects at higher amplitudes. Furthermore, several previous

studies suggested that stimulation of the PSA or the caudal zona incerta might lead
to at least equivalent7, 19 or even better tremor suppression than VIM-DBS.5, 20 In line
with these studies, this post-hoc analysis indicates a superiority of the PSA by
showing significant differences in TRS hemi-scores.
The major limitation of this study is that it did not include individual diffusion imaging.
On the other hand, population-based21 or atlas-based22 DRTTs have been used to
investigate DBS effects before. Additionally, the diffusion data used from the human
connectome project is superior in quality to most images acquired during clinical
routine and while a population-based average tract might neglect individual
neuroanatomic aberrations, it might also be less prone to tracking errors which have
been shown to occur when identifying individual DRTTs.15 Most importantly, the
average deviation of individual patient DRTTs from our population-based DRTT was
within the range of image accuracy (see supplementary material). We employed
probabilistic fiber tracking, as it might be better in detecting the DRTT than the
deterministic algorithms embedded in commercially-available stereotactic planning
software.15
Even though landmark-based targeting was used when implanting our patients
(PSA vs. VIM)7, the results nonetheless could be explained by proximity to the DRTT.
In conclusion, direct targeting of the DRTT, which has been demonstrated to be
feasible, could improve outcome even further.9 Future studies, which prospectively
compare direct targeting of the DRTT to landmark-based targeting are needed.
Moreover, it should be explored whether visualization of the DRTT can also guide
postoperative DBS programming. With population-based averaged tracts this could
even be investigated in patients who have not received individual diffusion imaging
prior to implantation.
