Abstract
HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a common and often painful
neurological condition associated with HIV-infection and its treatment. However, data
on the incidence of HIV-SN in neuropathy-free individuals initiating combination
antiretroviral therapies (cART) that do not contain the neurotoxic agent stavudine are
lacking. We investigated the six-month incidence of HIV-SN in ART naïve individuals
initiating tenofovir (TDF)-based cART, and the clinical factors associated with the
development of HIV-SN. 120 neuropathy-free and ART naïve individuals initiating
cART at a single centre in Johannesburg, South Africa were enrolled. Participants
were screened for HIV-SN at study enrolment and then approximately every twomonths for a period of approximately six-months. Symptomatic HIV-SN was defined
by the presence of at least one symptom (pain/burning, numbness, paraesthesias)
and at least two clinical signs (reduced vibration sense, absent ankle reflexes or pinprick hypoaesthesia). Asymptomatic HIV-SN required at least two clinical signs only.
A total of 88% of the cohort completed three visits within the six-month period.
Eleven individuals developed asymptomatic HIV-SN and nine developed
symptomatic HIV-SN, giving a six-month cumulative incidence of neuropathy of 140
cases per 1000 patients (95% CI: 80 - 210) at an incidence rate of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.2
- 0.5) per person year. Increasing height and active tuberculosis (TB) disease were
independently associated with the risk of developing HIV-SN (p < 0.05). We found
that within the first six months of starting cART, incident SN persists in the poststavudine era, but may be asymptomatic.

Introduction
The prevalence of HIV infection is high in sub-Saharan Africa and is expected
to stay high for the foreseeable future 1. The high prevalence of HIV infections
persists despite reduced infection rates because of the wide-spread availability of
combination antiretroviral therapies (cART), which improve survival 2. But, this
improved survival means that the total burden of chronic complications of HIV
infection may increase, and therefore, these complications need to be monitored and
managed to mitigate the impact they may have on the lives of people living decades
with HIV 3,4.

One of the most common chronic neurological complications of HIV-infection
and its treatment with neurotoxic combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is HIVassociated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN). The neuropathy is often symptomatic, with
pain being the salient feature 5,6, and these symptoms have a detrimental impact on
quality of life and function 6,7. Unfortunately, there are no widely-available
pharmacological therapies with proven efficacy in the management of painful HIV-SN
8–10

, which means that prevention of symptomatic HIV-SN is a key strategy. To limit

side effects such as HIV-SN, the World Health Organisation (WHO) firstly lowered
the dose, and then removed, the neurotoxic antiretroviral drug stavudine from all
first-line cART regimens globally 11,12. With the worldwide elimination of stavudine in
all first-line regimens and its replacement with tenofovir (TDF), an agent with no
known neurotoxicity, together with earlier initiation of cART, it has been anticipated
that the incidence of HIV-SN will decrease.

Several African studies have investigated the incidence of HIV-SN and factors
associated with its development 13–20. However, none of these studies assessed the
incidence of HIV-SN in a cohort universally exposed only to TDF-based cART.
Instead, these studies included individuals who had been exposed to several ART
regimens (including stavudine) or who were on cART regimens that did not include
TDF (globally, the most common cART initiation regimen). Furthermore, the
assessments used within these studies to assess HIV-SN status are
methodologically questionable. For example, one study only assessed symptoms 15,
while other studies did not state the method used to screen for HIV-SN 13,14,17.

Consequently, we investigated the six-month incidence of HIV-SN, using
methods recommended for the assessment and grading of peripheral neuropathy for
research and clinical purposes 21–23, in ART naive South African people living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and who were initiating TDF-based cART. We investigated the
six-month period after starting cART because on older stavudine-based cART, the
neuropathy typically developed soon after starting therapy. As a secondary objective,
we also described the clinical, disease-related and demographic risk factors
associated with HIV-SN development in this cohort.

Methods and Materials
We approached all treatment-naïve adult PLWHA who were initiating TDFbased cART at the Lenasia South Community Health Hospital, Johannesburg, South
Africa, to partake in the study. Recruitment was conducted from January 2016 to
December 2016. Participants were followed up for a period of approximately sixmonths. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Human Research
Ethics Committee (Medical) of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa,
clearance number: M121018. Written, informed consent was obtained from all
participants. An interpreter fluent in English and six indigenous languages explained
the study rationale and procedures in the participant’s language of choice.

Study inclusion criteria
All study participants had to be ≥ 18 years of age, have a confirmed HIV
diagnosis, have never received any antiretroviral treatment (including monotherapy)
for their HIV infection, be initiating TDF-based cART, and be free of signs of distal
symmetrical polyneuropathy (see neurological assessment below), although isolated
lower limb symptoms were permitted.

Study exclusion criteria
We excluded all participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria, and/or
who had the presence of medical conditions that affected sensation in, or
assessment of, the feet and lower limbs (e.g. Kaposi’s sarcoma).

Eligible participants had the following demographic and anthropometric data
recorded: sex, age, height, weight, ethnicity, date tested positive for HIV infection,

other potential risk factors for neuropathy (diabetes, alcohol consumption, vitamin
B12 deficiency, diabetes mellitus and treatment for active TB disease). All participants
with confirmed active TB disease were treated with rifafour [a four-drug combination
TB disease treatment that includes the following: ethambutol, pyrazinamide (PZA),
Isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin]. In addition, the above-mentioned participants were
also given pyridoxine as prophylactic treatment to minimize the development of HIVSN. Participants who did not have a confirmed diagnosis of active TB disease,
received prophylactic Isoniazid Preventative Therapy (IPT), which consisted of INH
(5mg/kg/day) and pyridoxine (started at 25mg titrated up to 100mg daily) for six to
nine months. Participants without active TB had the choice of starting IPT.

The following laboratory data (where available) were obtained from
participants medical records: CD4 T-cell count at the time of HIV testing (baseline
CD4 T-cell count), current CD4 T-cell count (could be the same at baseline CD4 Tcell count), HIV viral load, current Hepatitis B infection, and current syphilis infection.
A venous blood sample was taken from each participant at each visit to assess
HBA1c percentage (HBA1c > 7% was used to define the presence of diabetes
mellitus) and vitamin B12 concentrations (vitamin B12 < 142pmol/L was used to
define clinically relevant deficiency).

Procedures
Neurological assessment
Participants were assessed for the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy
(SN) using an amended version of the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen (BPNS),
which included the original BPNS plus the assessment of sensitivity to pin-prick. In

its original format, the BPNS is a validated screening tool for HIV-SN 24, and has
been previously used in the South African population 25,26. The BPNS case definition
is for symptomatic HIV-SN and requires the bilateral presence of at least one
symptom (pain/burning, paraesthesias, numbness), and the bilateral presence of one
clinical sign (vibration sense in great toe and ankle reflex testing). We added the
assessment of pin-prick sensitivity, to the BPNS tool for the following reasons: i) the
two tests in the BPNS assess large fibre pathology, while pin-prick sensitivity
assesses small-fibre pathology, ii) pin-prick sensitivity has high specificity in the
detection of HIV-SN 27, and iii) we wished to the increase the specificity of the
assessment (at the cost of sensitivity) by increasing the number of bilateral clinical
signs required by our case definition to two signs (see case definitions below).

A diagnosis of symptomatic HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN)
was made based on the bilateral presence of at least two signs (decreased vibration
sense in the great toe, absent ankle reflex or decreased pin-prick sensitivity) and one
symptom (pain, paraesthesias or numbness) in the feet. A diagnosis of
asymptomatic HIV-SN was made based on the bilateral presence of at least two
signs, but no symptoms, in the feet. By using participants medical history,
symptomatology, clinical assessment of nerve function, and the anatomical
distribution of signs and symptoms, we met the recommendations of England and
colleagues 21, Haanpaa and colleagues 22, and achieved a diagnostic certainty (for
symptomatic SN) of ‘probable neuropathic pain’ based on the grading criteria of
Finnerup and colleagues 23.

Vibration sense was assessed using a 128Hz tuning fork on the distal
interphalangeal joint of the participant’s great toe. Vibration sense was recorded in
both feet, with a recording of 10 seconds or less deemed abnormal 24. Ankle reflexes
were assessed using a rubber reflex hammer, where the investigator firmly struck
the achilles tendon to elicit a response. A positive ankle reflex response was
indicated by the plantar flexion of the foot and a negative response was recorded
when there was no flexion of the foot. The reflex test was performed three times to
confirm the response. Pin-prick sensitivity was assessed using a size 4 ‘single use’
safety pin. The ‘sharp’ and ‘blunt’ ends of the safety pin were alternately placed on
the dorsal surface of the participants great toes, and participants were asked to
identify the sensation experienced as either ‘sharp’ or ‘blunt’. Identification of the
‘sharp’ stimulus as being ‘blunt’ or that it was not felt at all was deemed abnormal. If
participants gave an incorrect answer, we then tested lateral to the point and then
progressed proximally in order to identify the extent/borders of nerve dysfunction.

When symptoms were present, the anatomical distribution of the symptom(s)
was(were) recorded and participants were asked to rate the severity of the
symptom(s) on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NRS), anchored at 0 (no
symptom experienced) to 10 (worst pain/or sensation imaginable).

Blood samples
One blood sample (4ml EDTA tube) was drawn from each at baseline and at every
scheduled visit. Samples were analysed for CD4 T-cell count, HIV viral load, HbA1c
levels and Vitamin B12 levels.

Timing of follow-up
Study participants were recruited over about a six-month period, and each
participant was followed up for six months, with four scheduled visits with the
investigator. Following recruitment and consent procedures, visits were scheduled at
0 months (Baseline; day of treatment initiation), 2 weeks, 2-months, 4-months and 6months after starting cART (supplementary material 2, Figure S2). Participants were
contacted telephonically a few days prior to their scheduled return to the hospital to
confirm their appointment day and to remind them to meet with the investigator.

Statistical analysis
All analysis scripts and the outputs from the scripts can be accessed on
Figshare (reserved doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.7856660), or can be cloned from
GitHub (https://github.com/kamermanpr/hivsn-incidence.git).

Descriptive statistics are presented as mean (standard deviation, SD) for
parametric data, median (interquartile range, IQR) for non-parametric data, and
percentages for frequency data. 95% confidence intervals of the mean/median
difference and odds ratios between ‘SN-free’ individuals and individuals with SN
were computed for analysis of factors associated with SN across the study period.

Our primary objective was to determine the incidence of HIV-SN. We used
both cumulative incidence data and incidence rate data to determine the incidence of
HIV-SN in our cohort. We first determined cumulative incidence, which measures
the number of new cases per person in the population over a defined period of time
(i.e. a fixed follow-up period). Therefore, to calculate cumulative incidence we

defined a fixed 6-month follow-up period. We also subdivided this period into a 1st
and 2nd 3-month period of this follow-up. To standardize the periods of follow-up, we
cleaned the data and used only visits that fell into the indicated periods: (0-3
months), (3-6 months) and (0-6 months) to define SN status. Using this method,
participant’s whose last clinic visit occurred after 91 days (end of first 3-month
interval) or at 182 days (end of 6-month interval), and who were found to have newonset SN at this visit, were recorded as ‘SN-free’ over the 3 or 6-month period of
follow-up, respectively. This conservative strategy may have led to some underestimation of the cumulative incidence of SN. We also determined incidence rate,
which is a measure of the number of new cases per unit of time. We did not have
exact dates of SN onset to define the per patient unit of time, and nor was there
uniform spacing between clinic visits. We therefore chose to calculate an
approximate SN onset time, arbitrarily defined as the number of days between the
first neuropathy screening and the mid-point between the visit when neuropathy was
detected and the preceding visit. For participants who did not develop SN, the date
of censoring was defined by the number of days between the first neuropathy
screening and the last screening (study exit).

Our secondary objective was to determine possible risk factors for developing
HIV-SN in our cohort. We first carried out an exploratory analysis using Cox
proportional hazard models, however, various predictors violated assumptions of the
model (e.g., proportional hazard, linearity, no influence points). We therefore
performed multivariable logistic regression analysis with elastic net regularization for
variable selection, with visit 1 (baseline) characteristics as predictors of SN onset.
Elastic net regularization performs both variable selection and regularization in order

to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it
produces. The process involved performing a 10-fold cross-validation to find the
optimal lambda (penalization parameter) and thereafter running the analysis and
extracting the model based on the best lambda. The advantages of regularized
regression methods come at the cost of biased estimates, and so we have not
reported the odds ratios. The models included the baseline values of all variables,
except diabetes mellitus (as no participants had diabetes at baseline), Vitamin B12
deficiency (as only one person had a deficiency at baseline) and weight as it was colinear with height.

Results
From January 2016 through to December 2016, 151 confirmed HIV-positive
individuals were assessed for eligibility for the study. One hundred and twenty
individuals met the requirements for inclusion in the study (Figure 1). Of the
individuals not fulfilling the entry criteria, and so not recruited, nine (6%, 9/151) had a
pre-existing neuropathy. All study participants identified themselves as of black
African ancestry; 104 (87%) were South African.

Demographic and clinical characteristics
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the study cohort are
shown in Table 1. Over three quarters of the cohort were categorized under WHO
stage III and IV (92/120, 77%), indicating that the majority of our patients were
immunocompromised. The median (range) CD4 T-cell count at initiation of the study
was 228 (1-1347) cells/µL. No participants had ever previously been exposed to any
other antiretroviral therapy, and all participants were initiated on TDF-based fixeddose triple combination [tenofovir + emtricitabine + efavirenz (TDF + FTC + EFV)].
One sixth of participants (20/120, 17%) were currently being treated for active TB
disease with rifafour with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) prophylaxis. About one third of
participants (41/120, 34%) without a diagnosis of active TB disease were being
treated prophylactically with IPT.

Symptom prevalence at baseline
At baseline, 20% of participants (24/120) presented with pain, 14% (17/120)
had paraesthesias, and 5% (6/120) presented with numbness in the lower limbs.
Despite the presence of these symptoms they were all classified as ‘neuropathy-

free’, as none of these participants presented with any signs of SN. Symptoms were
located primarily in the foot region for 85% (40/47) of participants with symptoms,
with the remaining 15% (7/47) of participants experiencing the extension of these
symptoms up to the ankle and knee regions. In participants with pain, the median
pain intensity was 5 (IQR 2-10) on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale.

Patient follow-up
Of the cohort, 88% had at least 3 clinic visits. Although participant follow-up
was planned for 0 (the day of cART initiation), 2, 4 and 6-months of cART, there was
variability in the visit schedules of participants as depicted in (supplementary
material 3, Figure S3). Timing of clinic visits stratified according to SN status is
provided in Figure 2.

The median (IQR) number of clinic visits for the entire cohort (n=120) was 3
(3) (supplementary material 3, Figure S4). There was no difference in the number of
clinic visits between those individuals that remained ‘SN-free’ [median (IQR): 3 (3-3)]
and those that developed SN [3 (3 - 3.25)]; X2 (df:1) = 4.35, p = 0.2]. There was also
no difference in the number of days between the first and last clinic visit between
those individuals that remained ‘SN-free’ [median (IQR) 184 (133-199)] and those
that developed SN [195 (182-208)], (Z = -2.10, p= 0.03; Two sample van der
Waerden test) (supplementary material 3, Figure S5), or days between successive
visits (F(1) = 0.02, p = 0.87; Type II Wald F test with Kenward-Roger df)
[supplementary material 3, Figure S6].

Incidence of neuropathy
Of the 120 confirmed ‘SN-free’ patients who were enrolled at baseline, a total
of 31% (37/120) of patients were lost to follow-up by the 6-month study period.
However, 88% (105/120) completed at least three visits or more. A total of 17%
(20/120) developed HIV-SN and 83% (100/120) remained ‘SN-free’. Using these
data, we calculated the cumulative six-month incidence of HIV-SN to be 140 cases
per 1000 patients (95% CI: 80 - 210). The cumulative incidence over the first threemonths of follow-up was 60 cases per 1000 patients (95% CI: 20 - 100), and for the
second three-months of follow-up was 90 cases per 1000 patients (95% CI: 40 140). The incidence rate of SN was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.2 - 0.5) per person-year. Nine
(8%) individuals developed symptomatic HIV-SN and eleven (9%) individuals
developed asymptomatic HIV-SN.

The presence of symptoms at baseline (including pain, paraesthesias,
numbness and burning) were associated with an increased risk of development of
HIV-SN across the six-month period [X2 (df:1) = 15.09, p< 0.001]. Of the (47/120,
39%) of participants that had presented with symptoms at baseline, 13% (6/47)
developed symptomatic HIV-SN and 9% (4/47) developed asymptomatic HIV-SN.
The median pain intensity of the 15% (3/20) patients that developed symptomatic
HIV-SN in the first three-month period, was 4 (IQR: 3-5). The median pain intensity
of the 30% (6/20) patients that developed symptomatic HIV-SN in the second threemonth period, was 5 (IQR: 4-10).

Survival curve analysis
Figure 3 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curve with the number and
percentage of patients at risk for developing neuropathy across the study period. Of
the 20 individuals that developed neuropathy, 7% (8/120) of patients developed
neuropathy within the first 50 days of cART; one patient developed neuropathy at
about two weeks. Within the next 100 days of cART, 10% (12/120) individuals
developed neuropathy. The last event of neuropathy development occurred at about
140 days. A secondary Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of whether the onset of
neuropathy differed between those who developed a painful neuropathy compared to
those with an asymptomatic neuropathy found that the onset of painful neuropathy
was more rapid than the onset of asymptomatic neuropathy (X2 (df:1) = 13.4, p<
0.001; supplementary material 4, Figure S7). The first painful neuropathy occurred at
± two weeks. The development of asymptomatic peripheral sensory neuropathy had
a slightly delayed onset with the first asymptomatic neuropathy occurring at about
day 25.

Multivariable analysis
We included baseline clinical, demographic, and physical factors in the
modelling process. The full model included: sex, active TB disease, age, rifafour/INH
prophylaxis treatment, CD4 T-cell count, height, viral load, and alcohol consumption.
Across all alphas, and the optimal lambda at each alpha, the models repeatedly
returned only two variables: increasing height and active TB disease.

Discussion
We investigated the six-month incidence of HIV-SN in a cohort of PLWHA of
black African ancestry who were universally exposed to TDF-based cART. We report
a six-month cumulative incidence of HIV-SN of 140 cases per 1000 patients (95%
CI: 80 - 210). The incidence rate was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.2 - 0.5) per person year. A
roughly equal number of individuals developed symptomatic (8%, 9/120) vs.
asymptomatic (9%, 11/120) SN. The presence of neuropathic pain was associated
with a more rapid onset of symptomatic HIV-SN. Increasing height and having
current active TB disease were the only consistent independent predictors of HIV-SN
in the cohort across several modelling parameters. Given the absence of any
neurotoxicity by TDF-based regimens, we do not believe that the continued
occurrence of HIV-SN is a direct effect of the treatment regimen on peripheral
nerves.

Our findings are novel and provide the first incidence data for individuals
solely exposed to TDF-based cART. Our findings indicate that the number of new
cases of HIV-SN is still high, even if substantially lower than those observed in a
similar cohort initiating stavudine-based cART 28. In the previously mentioned cohort,
44 individuals initiated stavudine-based therapy, and 41% (18/44) of these
individuals developed SN within 6-months 28. Our findings in the era of TDF-based
cART highlight two key facts: i) Incidence of HIV-SN is lower on TDF-based cART,
but still higher than we anticipated based on the lack of neurotoxicity of these drugs,
and ii) HIV-SN in the TDF-based era tends to present asymptomatically more often
compared to stavudine-based therapy where symptomatic HIV-SN was more
prevalent [~61%] 28.

While the increase in the proportion with asymptomatic neuropathy is
welcomed, this finding needs to be regarded with some caution: we only followed
individuals for six months and so it is not clear if asymptomatic SN remained
asymptomatic or whether it may have progressed to being symptomatic. Indeed, one
high-quality study suggested that asymptomatic SN may transition into symptomatic
HIV-SN within a 12 to 24-month period on cART 29. When symptomatic neuropathies
developed within our cohort, they developed rapidly (most cases occurring within 3months of initiating cART, and as early as two weeks), compared to asymptomatic
neuropathies, which developed more slowly (most cases within ± 5-months of
initiating cART). Rapid onset, painful neuropathies have also been reported in
cohorts on other cART regimens including stavudine, zidovudine and zalcitabine 30.

The data regarding associations between HIV-SN and disease markers such
as CD4 T-cell count and viral load are equivocal 31–33. Indeed, we found no
association with these variables and HIV-SN. However, a role for immune
dysfunction in mediating HIV-SN cannot be excluded. For example, animal models of
HIV and ART-induced neuropathy show immune activation in the dorsal root ganglia
and nerve trunks, and these changes mimic those seen in post-mortem studies in
humans with HIV-SN (for review: 34. Moreover, there are preliminary data suggesting
a particular inflammatory profile may be responsible for neuropathy, and particularly,
rapid onset painful neuropathy. In individuals starting cART, patients with greater
interleukin-1-receptor (IL-1R)-antagonist levels at baseline, and two weeks later
elevated levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor-alpha and tumour necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor-II were more likely to develop a symptomatic HIV-SN 19. Thus, it is
possible that a particular inflammatory response results in a faster onset and painful

HIV-SN, rather than exposure to a particular ART-regimen. Future studies are
required to compare inflammatory profiles between those developing fast and slow
onset HIV-SN.

The presence of active TB disease was an independent predictor of HIV-SN
in our cohort. Importantly, there was no association found between rifafour exposure
and HIV-SN, in our setting. The association between HIV-SN and treatment for
active TB disease is well documented on stavudine-based regimens, even with
pyridoxine supplementation 18,25,35–37. However, our study is the first study to
associate TDF-based cART and confirmed active TB disease with the development
of HIV-SN. The association between active TB disease and HIV-SN in those
individuals starting ART, may not be specific to the type of ART, therefore, but
perhaps related to the timing of ART and concurrent active TB disease. The timing of
ART initiation in the face of active TB disease can lead to TB-immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This condition involves a strong inflammatory
response to TB antigens during the acute phase of immune system reconstitution
that leads to clinical deterioration 38. If such immune dysregulation also is associated
with immune activation in peripheral nerves, then the probability of clinically apparent
neuropathy would increase. However, none of our participants developed frank TBIRIS, so this cannot be the mechanism underlying this association. Instead, we
hypothesize concurrent active TB disease may reduce the decrease in inflammation
that typifies the initiation of cART 39, thus predisposing affected individuals to
develop a neuropathy. Whatever the mechanism, if the relationship between HIVSN, concurrent active TB disease and cART is causal, then HIV-SN will remain a

problem in countries with high co-infection rates despite the introduction of nonneurotoxic regimens.

Increased height was an independent predictor of HIV-SN in our cohort.
Increasing height is a well-established risk factor for length-dependent
polyneuropathies such as HIV-SN and diabetic sensory polyneuropathy 40.
Therefore, it is not surprising that taller individuals would be more susceptible to the
development of HIV-SN 41.

There are several limitations to our work. One of these limitations was the
sample size of our cohort. We aimed to recruit a sample size of n=150 individuals,
although we did not achieve this number of participants, our cohort still consists of
the largest study of HIV-SN in ART naïve individuals initiating TDF-based cART. Our
sample size was a direct result of the referral of ART naïve individuals to larger
tertiary-based hospitals when they presented to the local clinic (where our
recruitment was based) with existing opportunistic infections such as cryptococcal
meningitis, pneumonia and Kaposi’s’ sarcoma. These opportunistic infections are
better managed in these large tertiary hospitals, due to the availability of specialist
care. Such individuals were initiated on ART at these tertiary hospitals and they
typically did not return to their local clinic, thereby reducing the number of ART naïve
individuals available at site for study recruitment. It also meant that our cohort
represented uncomplicated cases of HIV infection, and our results cannot be
extrapolated to more complicated cases. The other limitation was our retention of
participants. We aimed to retain as many study participants as possible across the
six-month period of our study. Despite having specific times for patient visits on our

protocol and allowing ± 2 weeks before or after scheduled visits for patients to come
in for their follow up visits, we faced several issues at the research site which were
out of our control and which disrupted the timing of participants returning for followup visits. These issues included frequent community service delivery protests at our
research site, which were violent and resulted in all entrances to the hospital being
blocked.

Conclusion
We report that the incidence of HIV-SN on TDF-based cART is indeed lower
than that observed on stavudine-based therapies, and HIV-SN that develops in TDFexposed individuals is more likely to be asymptomatic. Whilst these findings are
good news, it is important not to become complacent. There was still a percentage of
individuals who developed a rapid onset symptomatic neuropathy, which we know
will impact quality of life irrespective of the severity of the symptoms 42. Active TB
disease associated with development of HIV-SN in the cohort here. HIV-SN may well
continue to be a clinical problem in resource-poor countries in Africa and India where
prevalence of comorbid TB and HIV remains high.
