Abstract
Background
Machine learning assisted MRI radiomics, which combines MRI techniques with machine
learning methodology, is rapidly gaining attention as a promising method for staging of brain
gliomas. This study assesses the diagnostic value of such framework applied to dynamic
susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI in classifying treatment-naïve gliomas from a multi-center
patient pool into WHO grades II-IV and across their isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation
status.
Methods
333 patients from 6 tertiary centres, diagnosed histologically and molecularly with primary
gliomas (IDH-mutant=151 or IDH-wildtype=182) were retrospectively identified. Raw DSCMRI data was post-processed for normalised leakage-corrected relative cerebral blood
volume (rCBV) maps. Shape, intensity distribution (histogram) and rotational invariant
Haralick texture features over the tumour mask were extracted. Differences in extracted
features between IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant gliomas and across three glioma grades
were tested using the Wilcoxon two-sample test. A random forest algorithm was employed
(2-fold cross-validation, 250 repeats) to predict grades or mutation status using the extracted
features.
Results
Features from all types (shape, distribution, texture) showed significant differences across
mutation status. WHO grade II-III differentiation was mostly driven by shape features while
texture and intensity feature were more relevant for the III-IV separation. Increased number
of features became significant when differentiating grades further apart from one another.
Gliomas were correctly stratified by IDH mutation status in 71% of the cases and by grade in
53% of the cases. In addition, 87% of the gliomas grades predicted with an error distance up
to 1.
Conclusion
Despite large heterogeneity in the multi-center dataset, machine learning assisted DSC-MRI
radiomics hold potential to address the inherent variability and presents a promising approach
for non-invasive glioma molecular subtyping and grading.

Key points
- On highly heterogenous, multi-centre data, machine learning on DSC-MRI features can
correctly predict glioma IDH subtyping in 71% of cases and glioma grade II-IV in 53% of the
cases (87% <1 grade difference)
- Shape features distinguish best grade II from grade III gliomas.
- Texture and distribution features distinguish best grade III from grade IV tumours.
Importance of study
This work illustrates the diagnostic value of combining machine learning and dynamic
susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI (DSC-MRI) radiomics in classifying gliomas into
WHO grades II-IV as well as across their isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status.
Despite the data heterogeneity inherent to the multi-centre design of the studied cohort (333
subjects, 6 centres) that greatly increases the theoretical challenges of machine learning
frameworks, good classification performance (accuracy of 53% across grades (87% <1 grade
difference) and 71% across mutation status) was obtained. Therefore, our results provide a
proof-of-concept for this emerging precision medicine field that has good generalisability and
scalability properties. Introspection on the classification errors highlighted mostly borderline
cases and helped underline the challenges of a categorical classification in a pathological
continuum.
With its strong generalisability property, its ability to further incorporate participating centres
and its possible use to identify borderline cases, the proposed machine learning framework
has the potential to contribute to the clinical translation of machine-learning assisted
diagnostic tools in neuro-oncology.

Introduction
The most recent grading system of gliomas has integrated the mutation status of key
encoding genes prompting a ground-breaking change in the context of glioma diagnosis and
treatment

1,2

with further molecular stratification achieved by determining CDKN2A/B

status3. Tumour anatomical features and gadolinium enhancement properties are not
sufficient for this task and are extremely variable across different types and grades of gliomas
with low specificity rates4,5. To overcome this limitation, advanced imaging techniques such
as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), MR spectroscopy, and dynamic susceptibility contrast
(DSC)-MRI (also known as perfusion-weighted MRI) have been tested. Perfusion-weighted
MRI provides biomarkers tightly linked to the tumour vascularity and thus indices of the
biochemical and genetic substrates related to neo-angiogenesis6,7. ‘Gain-of-function’
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations result in the accumulation of the “oncometabolite”
2-hydroxy glutarate (HG) and cause an increase in the activity of the hypoxia-inducible
factor-1, which has a pivotal role in the energy metabolism, angiogenesis and apoptosis8.
Therefore, perfusion MRI biomarkers carry the potential to act as diagnostic surrogates of
IDH mutation status and further for tumour grading.

DSC-MRI is often favoured, compared to other MRI-based perfusion techniques, for its
higher temporal resolution and sensitivity for detecting abnormal angiogenesis resulting in
high accuracy rates for baseline tumour grading and tumour surveillance7. To date, these
encouraging findings have been mostly obtained in single-institution settings utilising
different DSC-MRI acquisition techniques and post-processing software packages for
quantitative analysis. This can result in significant variation7 and, hence, limit the diagnostic
value of the technique impeding its large-scale application for non-invasive tumour
phenotyping9–11. Recently, a consensus paper for DSC-MRI acquisition guidelines aimed to
act as a blueprint and provide a framework for achieving routine success with this
technique12.

The vast majority of the published DSC-MRI studies have focused on establishing the value
of the tumour region of interest rather than encompassing the whole tumour. They have made
use of histogram analyses, which nonetheless reflect numeric values of the voxels and only
help to calculate first-order statistics. By contrast to first-order statistics, second- and higherorder statistical analyses, which allow measures of not only local voxel-wise values but also

incorporate neighbouring information, have been suggested as more reliable and elaborative
methods for characterisation of the region-of-interest13. Texture analysis, as a contextual
quantification method, has already embarked in the medical imaging literature as a method
that can detect tissue heterogeneity and complexity13,14. Radiomics, applied in the clinical
context of glioblastoma, have generally been performed on anatomical sequences and applied
to distinguish between GBM subtypes15, for prediction of survival rates16 and prognosis17,
prediction of response to treatment18, as well as risk stratification19. Deep-learning based
techniques have recently received a sustained attention due to their high performance in such
classification tasks20,21. Nonetheless, there is limited biological insight in their decision
process making failure cases difficult to interpret. An alternative is to use the classical
feature-based machine learning methods as diagnostic tool and to evaluate the relevance of
acquisition sequences. In such a framework, interaction between clinical interpretation and
machine learning is essential. Indeed, an iterative loop between clinical interpretation and
machine learning analysis based on advanced features can help to define most distinguishing
images properties and exclude non-relevant ones. Such process would result in the definition
of disease specific imaging signatures.

While the high heterogeneity among DSC-MRI acquisition protocols may contribute to
lowering the diagnostic value of any single first-order statistic, this work sought to examine
the role of higher-order analysis and machine-learning assisted radiomics in mitigating these
limitations and augment the diagnostic accuracy of DSC-MRI for tumour staging with
emphasis on IDH molecular subtyping. We hypothesise different combination of features are
to be used according to the distinctions to be looked after encompassing either tissue
heterogeneity between high grade GBM or measures of dissemination (using shape
assessment) at lower grades. Compared to the work presented by Lu et al, where a publicly
available database was used focusing solely on structural imaging, this work focuses for first
time on the use of DSC-MRI acquisition in a multicentre setting. The heterogeneity inherent
to the multi-centre quality of the data, makes the task of tumour and molecular phenotyping
even more challenging. If successful, the proposed platform is readily expandable to include
more participating institutions or utilising different machine learning approaches – all aiming
to increase the diagnostic capacity and power to determine the most appropriate parameters
for conducting DSC-MRI experiments. With this in mind, this work has potential to become
a first step for a widespread application of machine-learning assisted diagnostic aid in neurooncology.

Materials and methods
Study design and ethics
This multi-center study was based on retrospectively identified or prospectively acquired
neuro-oncology MRI data collection in the participating centres, according to the local
institutional review boards guidelines and the respective local ethical committees’ approvals.
Data sharing agreements between the collaborators and the central reading and postprocessing site were also in place.

Subjects
DSC-MRI data of 359 patients from 6 university hospitals with histopathologically and
molecularly confirmed primary, treatment naïve gliomas (WHO grades II-IV) between
January 2010 and May 2018 were consecutively collected and screened for this study. The
inclusion criteria were as follows: i) existence of preoperative DSC-MRI examination raw
data suitable for post-processing and ii) availability of histopathological and molecular
testing least for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations2. Images with non-correctable motion artefacts
(n= 8) and corrupt source data (n= 18) were excluded. Finally, 333 patients were included in
the analysis.

Histopathology
All gliomas in the cohort were diagnosed according to the WHO 2016 classification scheme,
complemented with molecular profiling for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations2,23–25. The assessment
of morphological features and immunostaining in the tumour samples was performed by
neuropathologists in each institution. All IDH1R132H immune-negative gliomas were
investigated by Sanger sequencing to identify out common tumour driver mutations of IDH1,
IDH2, histone H3F3A, TERT promoter and BRAF genes26,27. 1q/19p codeletion status,
EGFR amplification and 10q loss were determined by using a qPCR-based copy number
assay in a subset of the participating institutions.

MR Imaging
The eligible patients were examined on either 1.5T MR scanners (n=186, 56%) (Siemens

Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) or 3T MR units (n= 147, 44%) (Siemens Skyra,
Siemens Allegra, Siemens TrioTim, Siemens Biograph_mMR, Siemens Healthineers,
Erlangen, Germany; Philips Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands,
3T, Signa HDx, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA).

Tumour delineation and parametric modelling
Tumour segmentation was performed manually by the same radiologist, who was blind to the
immunohistopathological results, on axial T2 (n=167, 49.7%) or axial FLAIR (n=169,
51.3%) series using ITK-SNAP Version 3.6.028 excluding large cystic or necrotic tumour
components and large vessels in line with previous relevant literature. When available, 3D
T2/FLAIR series were preferred to their 2D counterparts.

Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps were generated from the DSC –MRI raw data
using dedicated commercially available postprocessing software (Olea Sphere, Version 3;
Olea Medical Solutions, La Ciotat, France). Perfusion source images motion correction,
temporal and spatial filtering was applied in all cases. Subsequently, the software
automatically defined the arterial input function (AIF) for each individual based on all voxels
throughout the time series using global clustering method as it was described by Mouridsen
et al29. Instead of the standard deconvolutional mathematical algorithms, a fully adaptive
Bayesian scheme, which has been shown to be superior to the widely used classical
approaches30,31, was chosen to derive the perfusion indices aiming at the most possibly
accurate contrast agent leakage correction.

Spatial and intensity normalisation
The customised pipeline for the post-processing of the tumour segmentations and perfusion
(rCBV) images is presented in Figure 1a. The data was prepared for advanced analysis by
isotropic resampling of the T1-weighted images followed by registration, normalisation of
the parametric rCBV maps, and biomarker extraction through distribution and texture
features. Isotropic resampling to 1mm3 voxels was facilitated using the NiftyReg open source
software (https://sourceforge.net/projects/niftyreg) to allow for the computation of rotational
invariant textural features. The T2-weighted/FLAIR images and rCBV maps were rigidly
registered to the T1 isotropic image using NiftyReg32 and trilinear interpolation. The resulting
co-registered maps were visually inspected to evaluate the success of the registration step. At

the third stage, automatic normalisation of the parametric maps was performed in order to
mitigate inter-subject variability and therefore, enable comparison of statistical and textural
features across subjects. At this step, the basal ganglia of both hemispheres were initially
segmented using the Geodesic Information Flows framework (GIF)33, a label fusion
framework allowing for a local weighting of the information from a labelled database
according to measures of local morphological similarities. The basal ganglia in the tumourfree hemisphere was used as a reference area for normalisation of the rCBV maps instead of
healthy white matter in order to mitigate the risk of variability across the subjects due to
white matter degeneration and vasculopathy. For tumours extending in the contralateral
hemisphere, any tumour tissue was first removed from the reference region. Consequently, zscore maps over the tumour mask were derived with respect to the intensity distribution over
the normalisation area.

Feature extraction
Comprehensive biomarker extraction was performed using the normalised parametric maps.
To capture tumour shape, four shape features (volume, surface/volume ratio, noncompactness) were extracted for each tumour mass. For distribution mapping, thirteen
histogram features (mean, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, 1st,
5th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, 95th and 99th percentiles) were extracted through all voxels in
each segmented tumour. Finally, the twelve Haralick features and including angular
secondary moment (ASM), contrast, correlation, sum square, sum average, inverse difference
moment (IDM), sum entropy, entropy, difference variance, sum variance, difference entropy,
IMC1) for each tumour were also extracted34.

Statistical analysis
All extracted intensity based features were corrected for the influence of MR acquisition
parameters on the extracted features was scrutinised by scanner manufacturer, magnetic field
strength (1.5T and 3T), TR (≤1499 ms and ≥1500 ms), TE(25-44 ms and 45-55 ms), FA (90°
and <90°)slice thickness (<5 mm and ≥5 mm), and matrix size (matrix size <128x128 and

≥128x128) and in plane resolution (<=1, >1 and <=2, >=2). Following correction for these
covariates, two-sample Wilcoxon test was used to report the differences in all extracted
features between IDH mutation status and across pairs of grades. Results were considered to
be significant if p-value ≤ 0.05 and all statistical analysis was carried out using Stata v14 and

python 3.7. Effect size difference was calculated using Cliff’s Delta.

Supervised learning from extracted features
All extracted features and acquisition parameters were used as input to a random forest35 to
classify gliomas according to their IDH mutation status (IDH-mutant vs IDH-wildtype as a 2class classifier) or according to their grade II, III and IV, as a 3-class problem. For each task
(IDH mutation or grade assessment) training was performed in a stratified two-fold crossvalidation setting with 250 repetitions to assess the value of rCBV-extracted features.
Hyperparameters were optimised in a cross-validation setting leading to two different settings
for the mutation task (200 trees, maximum depth of 10, minimum samples per leaf of 4) and
the grade separation task (800 trees, minimum samples per leaf=4, maximum depth of 50).
Error, computed as the difference between predicted and true classification was averaged
over the 250 iterations and t-test over the error distribution were performed to assess the
differences observed across acquisition parameters. Confusion matrices using the average
classification were constructed to summarise the classification performance of the machine
learning algorithm, from which the overall accuracy of classifying different gliomas cohorts,
as well as overall sensitivity and specificity rates were calculated.

Error introspection
In order to have more insight into the cases of erroneous classification, features were
compared for each category of misclassification (wild type classified as mutant, mutant as
wild type, grade II as grade III etc) and their rightly classified counterpart to investigate if
there was a consistency in the features leading to the misclassification and whether or not it
was consisted demographic findings between said classes. Wilcoxon 2 samples tests were
performed on the features corrected for acquisition parameters, age and gender as per the
demographic analysis.

Results
Demographic findings
Overall, data included 333 glioma patients comprising 198 males and 135 females with a
mean age 48.9 years (age range 20–81 years). Of these, 101 were classified as grade II, 74
were grade III and 158 were grade IV while 151 were IDH-mutant and 182 were IDHwildtype gliomas (Figure 1b). Details on the demographics of the patient population, tumour

location, histological grades and the molecular mutation status are contained in table S1 of
Appendix A.

Effect size of acquisition parameters are presented with the value of the Cliff Delta in
supplementary table S2. Shape, histogram and texture features for comparing gliomas by
mutation status and across three different grades are shown in Table 1, with Cliff’s Delta
effects sizes presented pictorially in Figures 2.

Glioma stratification for IDH mutation status
When comparing gliomas by mutation type, 20 out of the 29 extracted features were
significantly different between IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutants (column 6 on Table 1 and
Figure 4A). Tumour surface to volume ratio (SAV) and measure of non-compactness were
significantly lower in IDH-mutants compared to IDH-wildtype, as were six rCBV histogram
features, including mean, standard deviation, 25th,50th,75th, 95th and 99th percentiles. Among
the texture features, correlation and sum entropy were significantly higher in IDH-mutant
tumours than in the IDH-wildtype (p<0.0001), while sum square, sum average, sum variance,
entropy and difference variance features were significantly lower (p≤0.0001) in IDH-mutant
gliomas compared to IDH wildtype gliomas.

Glioma stratification for WHO-grade
When comparing gliomas grade III vs grade II, the surface to volume ratio shape feature, was
significantly (p=0.021) higher in grade III gliomas compared to grade II gliomas as was the
non-compactness feature (p=0.042) (Table 1, column 13). The IMC1 measure was also found
to be lower in grade III compared to grade II (p=0.040)

The shape features did not differ between grades III and IV. Among the histogram features, 8
out of the 13 features were different with 5 (mean, STD, 50th, 75th, 95th and 99tth percentile)
higher and skewness and kurtosis lower in grade IV compared to grade III gliomas. Finally,
among the texture features 9 out of 12 features were different. Notably texture features
related to appearance heterogeneity such as the entropy, sum square and sum variance were
larger in grade IV than III, while measures of correlation and inverse difference momentum
were lower.

Comparing gliomas grades IV with II, significant differences could be observed in most of
the extracted features (23 out of 29). Of the shape features, SAV and non-compactness were
higher, with non-compactness of greater degree, in gliomas grade IV compared to grade II.
Five histogram features (mean, 25th, 50th, 75th,95th percentile) were higher while skewness
and kurtosis were lower in grade IV compared to grade II gliomas. Finally, among the texture
features, 10 out of 12 features, with only the contrast and the difference variance not
presenting any statistically significant difference. Overall, comparisons between grade II and
IV combined the differences observed between grade II and III and grade III and IV.

Classification results
The confusion matrices describing the accuracy of the random forest algorithm are contained
in the supplementary table S5 and are depicted in Figure 4B. The random forest algorithm
correctly classified gliomas by IDH mutation status in 71% of the cases. This was slightly
higher when we considered data from 1.5T scanner only (77% accuracy) while the accuracy
dropped to 66% when we considered data from 3T scanner only. Stratifying gliomas by IDH
mutation status had an overall specificity of 77% and specificity of 65%. When magnetic
field strength was taken into consideration, at 1.5T the specificity rate increased up to 83%
with a sensitivity at 70% while the specificity was of 72% and the sensitivity of 60% at 3T.
Overall, we obtained significant (p=0.008) lower error rates of stratification at 1.5T (0.25) in
comparison to 3T (0.35) (Table S3 and confusion matrices). Resolution appeared also to be
associated with error, higher resolution leading to lower error rates (0.196 vs 0.320 p=0.024
for <=1mm vs between 1 and 2 mm) (see Table 3 Supplementary Table S2).

When classifying the gliomas by grade, 53% of included gliomas were classified correctly
and 87% of the cases received grade classification with a distance less or equal to 1. The
accuracy of classifying gliomas by grade was higher using perfusion data obtained at 1.5T
magnetic field rather than at 3T: 59% and 46% respectively, p=0.024, with grade distance of
less than 1 in 91% and 83% of the cases, respectively. Acquisition parameters had different
effect with a larger error for lower resolution (p=0.026), TR value (p=0.009) with a larger
error for TR below 1500 ms; a flip angle value of 90 degrees was associated with higher error
rates (p=0.006).

When investigating in more details the misclassified cases (see Figure 5), it appeared that the
characteristics of these gliomas reflected the texture properties of the classes they were
misclassified into both with respect to the mutation status or the grading. For instance,
similarly to what was observed between grade II and IV, the cases wrongly classified as
grade IV instead of grade II had a significantly lower compactness, with higher mean and
kurtosis and lower skewness as well as lower correlation and higher entropy among others.
Numerical mean of z-score differences for each of the possible error cases are reported in
Supplementary table 4.

Discussion
Our results suggest that the application of machine learning strategies to DSC-MRI extracted
features, can successfully classify gliomas from multi-center patients pool by IDH mutation
status and WHO grades II, III and IV. Applying a random-forest algorithm, we accurately
predicted IDH mutation status in 72% of the cases with an overall specificity of 77% and
sensitivity of 65%. On average, the algorithm classified 53% of the gliomas correctly into
three histological grades II-IV, and with 87% the classification with an error distance of less
than 1.
The novelty of our work is that we show that even simple shape features can help in the
distinction between grade II and higher grades. The measure of non-compactness was
significantly higher in WHO grade III or grade IV compared to grade II, reflecting possibly
higher infiltrative features in these tumours. Interestingly, this shape feature was not found to
be significantly different between WHO grade IV and grade III groups. It must be noted that
in the existing literature, histogram features have generally been favoured against shape
descriptors36–38. Falk et al. have found that 90th percentile rCBV values were significantly
lower in grade II gliomas than grade III (AUC=0.77, p=0.04), but they have also found the
standard deviation of rCBF was the best discriminative feature with the highest AUC in the
same setting (AUC=0.80, p=0.02). Our results do not confirm these findings, with histogram
features only relevant markers of grade difference between grades IV and II or IV and III.
Therefore, we suggest that shape descriptors, such as non-compactness and surface to volume
ratio, have to be considered in the mapping of the composition of gliomas as they correlate
well with histopathological findings. Perfusion texture features measuring the degree of
intensity heterogeneity (such as the correlation or the sum of variance) appeared to be
significantly different across the IDH mutation groups. Similar large number of markers of

tissue heterogeneity were found to be different across a paired comparison of grades IV vs III
and grades IV vs II. These observations are biologically relevant as they reflect
heterogeneous microenvironment in high-grade gliomas, which is also consistent with
diffusion studies14,39. It can be postulated that texture features reflect the continuum of
appearance evolution between grades but the results highlight the challenge of strictly
separating grades III from the two extremes of the spectrum (grade II and grade IV).

The prediction rate in our study performed better (65% of specificity, 79% sensitivity) than
the one reported by Kickingereder et al.8 in a single-centre trial despite the overall
heterogeneous nature of our large cohort in terms of molecular subgroups and DSC
acquisition protocols. Similar machine-assisted techniques for tumour grade prediction
demonstrated accuracy between 73% and 85%40–43. While our algorithm performance appears
slightly inferior to the aforementioned results, we note that in all these studies patients are
recruited from one centre, while we considered patients data from six centres. With multicenter data we expect higher variability and heterogeneity and hence anticipated lower
accuracy. Using a different simulation approach might however improve accuracy. Citak-Er
et al.43 have proposed the use of a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) with ten-fold
cross-validation based on features extracted from conventional and advanced MRI data (DTI,
DWI, DSC perfusion and MR- Spectroscopy), and reported 73.3% of overall sensitivity from
their multiparametric MR imaging. For the purpose of our study we chose random-forest
algorithm as an established method for three classes or more classification. Future work
would probably involve combining radiomics features from additional advanced MRI
sequences so as to better identify required sequences for an optimised performance. With the
recent rise of deep-learning techniques that do not rely on hand-crafted features, further
exploration on this end would be required notably to assess the behaviour of such solutions in
the identification of borderline cases, the associated uncertainty calibration as well as the
assessment of robustness to acquisition changes.

Our error analysis was performed to better characterise the existing continuum between
ordinal categories such as glioma grades. Analysis of the relationship between
misclassifications and used features was strongly in agreement with previously well-known
MRI shortcomings in tumour staging. For instance, some tumours incorrectly classified as
WHO grade IV instead as grade III had significantly higher mean intensity in rCBV images.
This highlights the inadequacy of first-order statistics to establish clear cut-off values

regardless the sophistication of the DSC technique. This paradigm exemplifies the biological
interpretability of machine-learning based radiomics compared to non-feature based methods
and illustrates how it can be used to re-evaluate categorical classifications and improve
characterisation and understanding of the pathological continuum in glioma grades, in
particular with emerging novel, validated molecular biomarkers, such as CDKN2A/B
deletion in IDH-mutant astrocytomas, which have been suggested to form a new clinical risk
group3. Such use of radiomics techniques parallels the findings of new biological definition
of GBM subgroups described in the work from Rathore et al44.

Overall, this proof-of-concept study aimed to assess the diagnostic value of the DSC-MRI
radiomics in treatment-naïve gliomas using multi-centre study design without a priori
consensus on the acquisition parameters and settings (incl. MR field strength, sequence type,
resolution, acquisition parameters). Different suggestions for sequence optimisation in DSCPWI, especially across TE and FA, are available in the literature30. The large protocol
variability observed in our cohort allowed us to investigate the effect of these key
characteristics. Acquisition metrics were dichotomized based on existing literature30,45, and
subsequently analysed prediction results across defined groups. Higher acquisition resolution
was significantly associated with lower error rates. Error in grade prediction was more
sensitive to acquisition parameters than the distinction between IDH wild-type and mutant.
Additionally, lower field strength associated with lower variability in scanning protocols led
to lower absolute errors (p= 0.02 and p=0.01 for IDH and WHO grade respectively). Higher
sensitivity and specificity rates with lower errors were achieved in the estimation of IDH
mutation (82%, 70%, 0.26 at 1.5T, and 72%, 60%, 0.37 at 3T, respectively), and better WHO
grade predictions, exact or with a distance, at 1.5T systems when compared to 3T. In fact,
while higher spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio from higher magnetic fields may turn
into an advantage in DSC imaging, which eventually leads decrease in the dose of contrast
material and acquisitions time, protocol variability may increase image appearance
heterogeneity. This result cannot be generalised in favour of the 1.5T field strength scanners
as this would need a controlled randomised study but it stresses the need for imaging
acquisition guidelines to harness the potential of technological advances, such as higher MRI
fields. Last but not least, partial volume effect caused by surrounding tissues in the point of
arterial input function may also result in erroneous estimation of rCBV.

The main strength of this work lies in both the multi-centre design and, though limited for

optimised learning approaches, still the largest cohort in the literature to utilise machinelearning based radiomics as a predictive diagnostic tool. Since the analyses were purposefully
performed across perfusion data only, further studies are needed to assess a combined impact
of a multimodal approach (e.g. DWI, T1-weighted MR perfusion, MR spectroscopy, PET) in
the imaging phenotyping in gliomas, though this carries the risk of introducing further
considerable variability. The small number of patients in some groups did not allow to form
integrated molecular subgroups, akin to previous work and undertake multi-class optimised
learning classification according to the integrated histomolecular WHO classification
scheme. Further data is continuously being gathered from the existing and new participating
centres to extend the work in this direction.

In conclusion, the findings underscore the satisfactory diagnostic contribution of DSC-MRI
extracted higher-order features combined with machine-learning in the automated
classification of grading and IDH mutation status of gliomas mitigating the high imaging
heterogeneity. The promising results obtained through the proposed random forest radiomicsbased framework, are an additional step towards the clinical translation of machine learning
tools as diagnostic aid aiming at facilitating the implementation of tailored treatment based
on precision imaging
