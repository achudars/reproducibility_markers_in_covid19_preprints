Abstract

28

Objective: Observing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends is critical to identify emerging

29

pathogens and potential disease outbreaks. Determining these trends also allows for policy

30

evaluations and development of interventions. We performed a retrospective analysis of

31

microbiological testing results from a hospital and diagnostic facility in Lahore, Pakistan that

32

represents country-wide sampling. Within this analysis, data was disaggregated by nationality, as

33

it has been suggested that migration increases the burden of AMR. We sought to determine any

34

trends in AMR among populations, which are often at-risk, while contributing to AMR

35

surveillance in Pakistan, which currently does not have a national surveillance network.

36

Methods: Retrospective analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility records from 2014 to 2018 from

37

Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre (SKMCH&RC) in Lahore,

38

Pakistan was performed. All positive microbiological cultures from patients was analyzed to

39

assess antibiotic resistance rates of the most common bacterial isolates and incidence of

40

ESKAPE pathogens and emerging outbreaks among adults and children.

41

Results: For all years, data for a total of 12,702 and 78,130 bacterial and fungal isolates from

42

children and adults, respectively, with Pakistani nationality were analyzed. For all years, data for

43

597 and 2470 bacterial and fungal isolates for children and adults, respectively, with Afghan

44

nationality were analyzed. AMR rates largely did not vary between populations, but rather

45

followed similar trends. AMR rates also largely agreed with the World Health Organization

46

Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System results for Pakistan.

47

Conclusion: Pakistan requires increased AMR surveillance to identify emerging resistance

48

infections and outbreaks.

1. Introduction

51

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health concern worldwide. As of 2018, Pakistan was

52

the 5th most populous country in the world with 212.2 million people [1] . While Pakistan has a

53

national action plan to combat AMR[2], there is no national surveillance network, and global

54

reporting is done through the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Surveillance

55

System (GLASS) [3]. However, there is a voluntary coalition from major hospitals and

56

institutions that self-report antimicrobial resistance data, known as the Pakistan Antimicrobial

57

Resistance Network (PARN). A recent national situational report from 2018 highlighted the

58

burden and challenges of antimicrobial resistance in Pakistan[4]. Indeed, it has been recognized

59

as a national concern since 2014, however without comprehensive surveillance data it is difficult

60

to make accurate estimates of the burden of AMR throughout the country.

61

62

Adding to the complex situation in Pakistan is the influx of migrants and displaced populations.

63

The United Nations refugee agency estimates that Pakistan hosts more than 1.4 million registered

64

Afghan refugees [5]. It has been postulated that migrant groups add to the burden of AMR due to

65

poor sanitation conditions and access to medicines and healthcare, however this sentiment is

66

often anecdotal or without supporting data which can cause unnecessary stigmas. A recent

67

comprehensive systematic review that looked at the pooled prevalence of AMR among migrant

68

groups in Europe found that AMR was higher in refugees and asylum seekers than other migrant

69

groups, but did not find evidence of higher rates of transmission of AMR from migrant to host

70

populations [6].

72

Here, we add to AMR surveillance data in Pakistan, broken down by nationality (either Pakistani

73

or Afghan nationals). The strength of this data set is the large sample size, much larger than

74

GLASS reporting sample sizes for Pakistan, and the ability to analyze temporal trends.

75

Limitations include that official migrant status of patients and patient medical history is

76

unknown, therefore interpretation of data should be done with caution.

2. Methods

79

2.1 Sample collection

80

The retrospective descriptive study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer

81

Hospital & Research Centre (SKMCH&RC), Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised data related to all

82

microbiological cultures reported positive between 2014 and 2018. The hospital is a 195-bed

83

non-profit tertiary-care specialist cancer hospital with a referral base from all over the country

84

and adjoining regions. Additionally, the laboratory attached with the hospital runs through a

85

network of laboratory collection centers located in 50 major cities and towns of Pakistan. All

86

data was retrieved from the online records on the in-house information system database.

87
88

2.2 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing/Bacterial identification

89

All bacterial isolates tested during the above time period were identified by standard techniques

90

and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted according to Clinical

91

Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria.

92

93

2.3 Data Extraction

94

Migrants are defined as individuals born outside Pakistan; however, their patient history and

95

migrant status is unknown. Children were defined as individuals under the age of 18. Data was

extracted from de-identified patient records stored in a standardized Excel format using a

3. Results

102

3.1 Study Population

103

Among all years, data for a total of 12 702 and 78 130 bacterial and fungal isolates from children

104

and adults, respectively, with Pakistani nationality were obtained. Among all years, data for 597

105

and 2470 bacterial and fungal isolates for children and adults, respectively, with Afghan

106

nationality were obtained (Table 1).

107

108

3.2 Distribution of bacterial isolates

109

Among the top 5 most common bacteria isolated among adults for both populations were

110

Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae,

111

and this did not change between 2014 to 2018 (Table 2). In the adult Pakistani population

112

Enterococcus species filled out the top 5 most common bacterial isolate for each year, while for

113

the Afghan population it was Staphylococcus epidermidis. For Pakistani children, a similar

114

distribution including S. epidermidis is seen. For Afghan children, S. epidermidis, E. coli and S.

115

aureus are the most common bacteria across all years (Table 3). The full distribution of bacterial

116

infections for each year is provided in Supplemental File 1.

117

3.3 Trends in incidence of ESKAPE pathogens and Salmonella typhi

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19012617; this version posted November 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

119

The ESKAPE pathogens are the leading cause of hospital acquired infections[7], and as such we

120

mapped the trends in incidence of these bacteria from 2014 to 2018. S. aureus is the most

121

prevalent ESKAPE pathogen in adults for both populations, followed by P. aeruginosa and K.

122

pneumoniae (Fig. 1A&B). This does not change between 2014 and 2018. Plotting this data for

123

children from Pakistan shows a similar trend and rates to adult (Fig. 1C). Similar analysis was

124

not performed for Afghanistan due to low numbers (Table S4). The incidence of Enterococcus

125

faecium, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter spp. remain low.

126

127

While the incidence of A. baumannii did not increase dramatically (Fig. 1), we wanted to

128

determine if resistance to last-line antibiotics, carbapenem and colistin, changed. Carbapenem

129

resistant A. baumannii is an emerging infection in Pakistan[8]. We find that resistance to

130

imipenem and meropenem for both adults and children from Pakistan are within the reported

131

confidence intervals for data reported to GLASS in 2017 (53-72%)[9] and appear to be on a

132

downward trend from 2014 to 2018 (75.4% resistant to imipenem in 2014, 66.6% in 2018).

133

Colistin resistance in A. baumannii remains low ((highest percentage was 1.7% reported in 2016,

134

Table 4). For the population from Afghanistan, there were less than ten A. baumannii isolates, so

135

resistance rates were not calculated

136

137

We also looked at the incidence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi which have recently

138

occurred in Pakistan. Since 2016, over 300 extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid cases

139

emerged in Sindh, Pakistan. These bacteria were resistant to fluoroquinolones and the third-

140

generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone but typically still susceptible to azithromycin and

141

carbapenems [10]. Among the adult population from Pakistan, from 2014 to 2017 there were no

142

cases of ceftriaxone resistant S. typhi , however in 2018, 20% of cases (n=45) were now

143

ceftriaxone resistant (Table 4). No resistant to carbapenems and low resistance to azithromycin

144

were observed (Table 4). In Pakistani children, low resistance to ceftriaxone was observed (0-

145

5.9%) between 2014 to 2017. In 2018, 37.8% of S. typhi isolates (n=82) were resistant to

146

ceftriaxone but none were resistant to azithromycin. In 2017 however, 14.3% (n=35) of S. typhi

147

isolates from Pakistani children tested against azithromycin were resistant. There were no

148

detected cases of S. typhi in Afghan adults and only 1 case in 2018 in children which was

149

sensitive to all antibiotics tested.

150

151

3.4 Antibiotic resistance profiles and temporal trends

152

We extracted the antimicrobial susceptibility data of the most common bacterial isolates

153

Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae

154

for each year. The full table of resistance of these bacterial is provided in the supplemental data

155

(Supplemental Tables S1-S4).

156

157

For adults, we compared trends in % resistant for fluoroquinolones and carbapenems between the

158

two populations. We also looked at the % of oxacillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates

159

between the adult populations. Since the sample size for children from Afghanistan were very

160

low (below 10 and 20) we did not perform a comparative analysis. Looking at ciprofloxacin, %

161

resistance is similar between the two population, with the Afghan resistant rates being lower than

162

the population from Pakistan (Fig. 2), except for 2015 and 2016 for E. coli in which

163

ciprofloxacin resistance increases before decreasing (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, for S. aureus we see

164

that the upward trend follows each other (Fig. 2B). For imipenem, resistance is overall low for

7

165

both populations (Fig. 3). Again for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae resistance rates for the

166

Afghan population are overall lower than that of Pakistan. In K. pneumoniae, resistance to

167

carbapenems seems to be increasing for both populations (Fig. 3C). For P. aeruginosa for both

168

ciprofloxacin and imipenem, the % resistant for Pakistan appears to be stable while the %

169

resistant for the Afghan population is trending upwards but has not reached the levels of isolates

170

of those from Pakistan (Fig. 2C & 3B). For oxacillin resistance for S. aureus and S. epidermidis,

171

rates are very similar and strikingly follow a very similar trend (Fig. 4). It should also be noted,

172

that the sample size between the Pakistani and Afghan population differed by over 25-fold which

173

makes direct comparison complicated.

174

175

Another important last-line antibiotic is colistin. Colistin resistance for E. coli, S. aureus, P.

176

aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae was detected at <1% for adults and children in Pakistan with the

177

exception of K. pneumoniae in 2018. In this year colistin resistant K. pneumoniae for adults rose

178

to 5.9% (n=222) and 2.2% for children (n=45) (Table S1-S4). It is important to track these types

179

of changes to see if this is an emerging phenomenon. Colistin resistance was only detected in P.

180

aeruginosa isolates at 1.4% (n=74) in 2016 in the adult population from Afghanistan.

181

182

3.5 Comparison to WHO GLASS reporting

183

Data available from the WHO GLASS for 2017 as reported by the Center for Disease Dynamics

184

& Policy ResistanceMap[11] was compared to resistance rates reported here[9]. It should be

185

noted that both Pakistan and Afghanistan are enrolled in GLASS. There is currently no reported

186

AMR data for Afghanistan and data from 6 surveillance sites (4 hospitals and 2 outpatient

187

facilities) from the 2018 call for data for Pakistan. For S. aureus, oxacillin for both populations

188

levels were slightly below the confidence interval from GLASS for 2017 (63% (56-70%)), Table

189

4. For E. coli for both populations, ciprofloxacin resistance was ~15% higher outside the

190

confidence interval (56-62%) from GLASS. Carbapenem resistance was lower by ~5% lower

191

than the confidence interval reported (8-12%) (Table 5). Ampicillin and ceftriaxone were also

192

just below confidence intervals reported (Table 5). For K. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin resistance

193

for the Pakistan population fell within GLASS values while that of the Afghanistan population

194

was lower. For both carbapenems and third generation cephalosporins, % resistance for both

195

populations were lower than reported by GLASS (Table 5). Our sample size, especially for the

196

Pakistani population, is between 5.5 to 13-fold greater than the number of isolates that make up

197

the resistance rates in GLASS.

198

199

4. Discussion

200

Here, we present a situational report on antimicrobial resistance from a hospital and diagnostic

201

center in Lahore, Pakistan. We find that the resistance rates largely are within or close to the

202

range of previously reported values with a few notable differences (Table 5). However, national

203

reporting for all antibiotics and bacteria are still sparse and increased reporting would provide a

204

more comprehensive comparison. Notably, there were no striking difference in AMR rates for

205

the Afghan population compared to the Pakistani population. As discussed early, a recent

206

systematic review on AMR among migrant groups in Europe found AMR was higher in refugees

207

and asylum seekers than other migrant groups, but did not find evidence of high rates of

208

transmission of AMR from migrant to host populations [6]. Differences have been shown in the

209

type of AMR between migrant and host populations. For example a study comparing German

210

nationals to refugees shows differences in microbiome and prevalence of resistance genes [12].

211

A study of AMR in Vibrio cholera stains from Afghan patients in Iran showed differences in

9

212

resistance patterns. In Afghan patients resistance to erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole

213

trimethoprim and ampicillin was prevalent. In Iranian patients, resistance to tetracycline and

214

nalidixic acid was enriched, however the sample size for this study were low[13]. We do not

215

have genetic information to determine the underlying mechanisms of resistance.

216

217

Overall, this report agrees with previously reported levels of antibiotic resistance in Pakistan and

218

does not demonstrate any strong differences among the AMR burden between national

219

populations from one hospital and research facility in Lahore, Pakistan that provides diagnostic

220

testing for locations around the county. This report, though, represents a specific clinical

221

situation and more standardized reporting is needed to generate more robust country-wide

222

estimates. Retrospectively, we observe the emergence of ceftriaxone resistant S. typhi (Table 3),

223

however real-time analysis is critical for preventing outbreaks as they first emerge. National

224

averages and baselines are important for hospitals to measure incidence of resistance and note

225

any unusual changes or up or downward trends.
