Abstract
Intestinal

microbiome

alterations,

necessitating cross-disease comparisons and the use of multi-disease models. Here, we

performed meta-analyses on fecal metagenomes of Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative

colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), and identified 65 marker species and 74 marker

pathways that were significantly altered in >=2 studies of the same disease. We grouped

marker

species

by

their

co-occurrences

into

disease-specific

and

mixed

clusters

according to whether all the cluster members belong to the same disease, and revealed

their

distinct

phylogenetic

relationships:

species

in

disease-specific

clusters

are

phylogenetically related, while those in mixed clusters are more distant; strikingly, UC-

and CRC-specific species are phylogenetically closer than to CD-specific ones, likely

because

UC-patients

have

higher

risk

of

CRC.

Consistent

to

their

phylogenetic

relationships, marker species had similar within-cluster and different between-cluster

metabolic preferences. In CD and CRC, most marker species correlated with an indicator

of leaky gut, suggesting a link between gut dysbiosis and human derived contents. In fact,

our results suggested that due to physio-metabolic alterations, the diseased gut may

represent

a

stressed

environment

and

pose

stronger

selection

to

gut

microbes;

consequently, marker species in diseases showed more coordinated changes than the

controls. With the marker species and pathways, we constructed three high-performance

(including multi-disease) models with AUROC of 0.88 and true positive rates up to 89%,

due

to

industrial

urbanization and Western life-styles [1-6]. For example, IBD, comprising mainly Crohn’s

disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), has increased incidence in newly industrialized

countries in Africa, Asia and South America [7]; populations previously considered ‘low

risk’ including Indian and Japanese also witnessed significant increase in incidence [6]. In

addition, as the overall incidence of CRC remained high in major western countries, an

alarming trend of increased risk has been observed in young adults [3, 4].

IBD and CRC share several symptoms, including rectal bleeding, abdominal pain,

diarrhoea, weight loss, and anaemia; furthermore, CRC in young patients has similar ages

of onset to IBD (<50 years) [8]. In addition, patients with IBD are considered at high risk of

developing colorectal cancer, due to duration of inflammation and expansion of lesions.

The accumulative risk of CRC in IBD patients is increasing decade by decade [9]. The

European

Crohn’s

and

Colitis

(ECCO)

and

the

American

Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommend the IBD patients need to strengthen

But long-period surveillance

the

problem because of deficiencies of regular colonoscopies in detecting dysplasia and other

high risk factors in the elderly patients [10]. It thus can be challenging to accurately

research has pointed out [8].

Recent studies suggested that IBD and CRC are linked with complicated interplay of

various

components,

involving

genetics,

environmental

factors,

gut

microbiome

and

immune system [11, 12]. So far, a few hundreds of genes have been identified, whose

mutations and/or dysregulation of expressions were linked to increase risk of IBD and

CRC [13-16]. However, genetic factors together can only explain limited proportions of the

disease

incidences

[17-19].

Conversely,

other

factors

are

believed

to

be

major

contributors, especially gut microbes [12, 20-22]. The latter, along with metabolites and

antibiotics that they produced through digesting nutrients from food, the host and other

microbes, could

play important

roles

in modulating

host immunity

and inflammation,

maintaining gastrointestinal equilibrium and resisting alien invaders [23].

Fecal microbial dysbiosis in IBD and CRC have been observed, and subsequently

utilized to generate predictive models for patient stratification and/or risk evaluation [22,

24-26]. For example, IBD patients showed a reduction of taxa from

Firmicutes phylum and

enrichment of pathogenic species [25, 27, 28]. Several studies showed the IBD subtypes,

namely CD and UC had distinctive gut microbiota and metabolic profile, though results

differ across studies [29]. Gut microbes have been identified as potential markers in

distinguishing patients from controls in IBD and CRC individually, as both the increase of

pathogens and development of lesions in gut contribute to the dysbiosis through affecting

metabolic functions of bacteria [24, 30, 31].

However, binary models (i.e. models capable of distinguishing patients of a particular

disease from controls) created for single disease may lead to misdiagnosis, on account of

population and may not perform well on other populations [25, 27]. In addition, though

limited by the use of 16S amplicon sequencing data with low resolution, a study across

multiple diseases to search for disease-specific markers raised the issue that whether we

could distinguish one gut illness from others using solely the gut microbiome data [32].

In

it

necessary

to

multi-class models capable of distinguishing these common intestinal diseases which can

have very similar symptoms and associate with consistent gut microbiome alterations. It is

also

to

for

biases.

Meta-analysis is a method combining diverse projects and help us avoid biases from

individual study [33]; moreover, the latest surveys about CRC via meta-analysis suggest

the necessity in collecting metagenome data as much as possible to identify consistently

altered microbes in certain state [34, 35].

In this research, we collected thirteen metagenomics datasets for common intestinal

diseases known to have strong links to gut microbiota, including three, three, and seven

datasets for CD, UC and CRC respectively, and performed meta-analysis to (1) determine

disease-specific and consistent microbial alterations, (2) elucidate possible mechanisms

underlying the altered species associated with different disease states, and (3) generate

high-performance multi-class models using taxonomic and metabolic profiles for easier

and better clinical applications.

as

comparing with controls, we collected and processed raw data from thirteen shot-gun

sequencing datasets, consisting of three ulcerative colitis (UC), three Crohn’s disease

(CD) and seven colorectal cancer (CRC) datasets. We first assessed whether microbial

diversity differed between cases and controls in each of the datasets. In all CRC datasets

except PRJDB4176, significant differences of Shannon diversity between controls and

CRCs were not found (Supplementary Figure 1a). By contrast, alpha diversity decreased

generally in CD patients, while didn’t display a stable trend in UC patients (Supplementary

Figure 1b, c). We also found that the human DNA contents (HDCs), as calculated as the

percentage of sequencing reads mapped to the human genome, were significantly higher

in patients in all diseases (all blocked p-value < 0.001 in CRC, UC and CD separately;

We then performed meta-analysis on each disease to identify microbes that showed

significantly differential abundances in at least two datasets of the same disease and

referred them as “marker species” accordingly. We used univariate Wilcoxon rank sum

test (see Methods) on relative abundance of species to identify differential species in each

dataset (Supplementary Figure 3). Consequently, we identified in total 13, 47 and 16

marker species in UC, CD and CRC respectively; among which, ten were found in at least

two diseases and one was common to all diseases (Figure 1a). For CRC, marker species

were largely disease-enriched, including

and

Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra

Peptostreptococcus stomatis, most of which were consistent with previous studies [34,

35]. Conversely, CD patients showed a depletion of control-enriched species, including

Akkermansia muciniphila

and a few within the

Bacteroides

genus, which were also in

accordance with previous studies [25, 27, 28]. However, marker species in UC were a mix

of both but mainly driven by disease-enriched microbes (Figure 1a), unlike a recent study

that primarily showed a decreasing of control-enriched species [27]; the discrepancies are

likely due to study-specific results (Figure 1a).

To further characterize these marker microbes, we first focused on patient-enriched

ones and clustered them according to their distributions (i.e. prevalence) in all the case

samples. To overcome the variances in species abundances in different studies, we

defined positive samples for a given species as those in which the species was found with

higher relative abundance than 95% controls. We obtained a binarized matrix with each

row representing adisease-enriched marker microbe, and each column representing a

patient; the contents of the matrix could be either “1”, indicating the presence of a species

in

patient,

or

“0”

indicating

showed highest prevalence and were significantly enriched in their respective diseases

(Figure 1c).

The

results

suggest that

with

the

disease-specific clusters, it

would

be

possible to stratify different diseases using microbial profiles; however, it is noteworthy

that the

prevalence

was

generally higher for marker microbes in the mixed clusters

(Figure 1c, Mixed II & I) than those in the disease-specific clusters, highlighting the

challenges in distinguishing different diseases.

We further revealed interesting patterns among the disease-enriched marker species

based on their phylogenetic relationships (Figure 2). Firstly, disease-specific markers

often form their own branches, and are mostly closely related on the phylogenic tree, i.e.

they have rather low-levels of last common ancestors (LCAs) at the order, family and even

genus levels (Figure 2). Secondly, the taxonomic composition of shared marker microbes

is much more diverse; although they could form a single cluster on the phylogenetic tree

(with the exception of

they have an LCA of

F. nucleatum) and most of them belong to the Firmicutes phylum,
Bacteria

at the Kingdom level. Lastly and most importantly, this

phylogenetic tree revealed closer relationships between UC and CRC than to CD. For

example, UC- and CRC-specific markers are next to each other on the tree and all belong

to the order of

Bacteroidales.

Furthermore, they form a branch together with the shared

markers (Mixed I & II), which is parallel to the branch formed by CD-specific markers

(Figure 2). These results are consistent with the facts that UC patents are at higher risk for

developing CRC, as compared with CD patients [9].

F. nucleatum

was an outlier of the

shared clusters (Mixed I & II): it was known as a CRC biomarker [34, 35], belonging to the

Mixed I cluster, but was phylogenetically closer to the CD-specific markers (Figure 2); this

was likely due to the fact that

F. nucleatum

could be found in fecal samples with high

prevalence in many diseases, including UC and CRC (Supplementary Figure 4, using

data from GMrepo, a curated online database of human gut metagenomes [38]). Together,

we revealed phylogenetic patterns of the marker microbes that could only be revealed

through cross-disease analysis.

In addition to taxonomic profiles, we also processed the metabolic profiles predicted

from metagenomics data using HuManN2 (see Methods), and identified in total 74 marker

pathways with significantly different abundances between cases and controls in at least

We next characterized the marker metabolic pathways. Interestingly, we found that most

of the disease-altered pathways showed statistically correlations with the marker species.

As shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 6, we were able to recaptulate the

species clusters (including the control-enriched cluster identified in the previous sections)

using their correlated metabolic capacities, especially in degradation (Figure 3). This was

expected since most of the within-cluster microbes were phylogenetically close (Figure 2)

and expected to have similar metabolic capacities.

We focused mostly on the degradation pathways (Figure 3) because the latter could

better reflect the overall physio-metabolic properties of the gut environment in diseased

states. For example,

Eubacterium ventriosum

and a few control-enriched species were

positively correlated with most CRC-depleted pathways, such as starch degradation Ⅴ,

sucrose degradation III and D-galactose degradation V (Figure 3). These species are

capable of fermentating general carbohydrates and producing butyrate, which are of

anti-inflammatory effects in the gut [40]. Additionally, a few disease-enriched pathways

previously linked to CRC were also found to correlate with disease-enriched microbial

markers. For example,

Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7 1 58FAA

had a evident link with

L-glutamate degradation V, a CRC-specific pathway via D-2 hydroxyglutarate that could

drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition and induce CRC progression [41, 42]. Similarly,

IBD-enriched

had an association with creatinine degradationⅠ, a vital

function in supplying energy and keeping balance between ADP and ATP, indicating

disruption of gut mucosal barrier dynamics [43]. Besides, the CD-enriched cluster, in

association

with

HDC, also correlated significantly with several pathways for energy

production, including superpathway

of glucose

and xylose degradation,

glucose and

glucose-1-phosphate degradation, superpathway of fucose and rhamnose degradation

and superpathway of methylglyoxal degradation (Figure 3). Of note, most of the pathways

that related with the CD-specific cluster didn’t associate with any UC-altered bacteria,

indicating that although microbial and pathway profiles overlapped significantly, they could

capture different aspects of the gut metagenomics. Thus, clustered marker microbes

could signify (at least in part) the changes in the overall metabolic capabilities in diseases

and controls; in addition, these correlations between bacteria and microbial functions

across studies and diseases revealed differences in metabolism among patients with

different diseases, in particular IBD subtypes.

The gut metabolic properties are known to be influenced by food and microbial

activities. Recenlty, researchers also revealed that cells/metabolites derived from the

human host, likely due to compromised intestinal barrier (CIB), can also influence the

growth of individual bacterium and the gut microbes as a whole [25, 29]. CIB could lead to

increased human DNA contents in the gut metagenomics. As expected, we found that

HDCs were significantly elevated in cases of all projects (Supplementary Figures 2).

Suprisingly, we found HDCs were also significantly correlated with most marker species in

CD and

CRC

(Supplementary Figure

7).

Most interestingly,

E. ventriosum,

the

only

control-enriched bacterial marker shared by all three diseases, was negatively correlated

with HDCs in UC and CD (Supplementary Figure 8); the correlation was not significant in

Together, our results suggested that the increased human derived contents could be an

were in the controls of respective disease datasets (Figure 4). For example, we found 18

pairs of correlated marker species (meta fdr<0.05, see Methods) in CRC, increased from

12 in the controls (Figure 4a,d). Similarly, we found much more correlations among

markers in cases than in controls in CD; notably, we found increases in both positively and

negatively correlated species pairs (Figure 4b,d). In UC, we found 9 pairs of correlated

marker species (meta fdr<0.05) in cases, increased from 5 in the controls (Figure 4c,d).

We also identified the potential powerful species in the networks using eigenvector

centrality scores (ECSs) (Supplementary Figure 9). ECS served as assessment of node

influence in a weighted network, measures the importance of the given node considering

not only its connections with others, but also the connections of its related nodes. We

Nevertheless, health-related species were also the hub bacteria in patients with IBD.

Nonetheless, we achieved slightly better classification performance (i.e. TPs) on UC and

CD than a recent study (0.58 and 0.89 TRPs for UC and CD samples in our study, as

compared to 0.49 and 0.66 in ref [25]).

We also built two additional models, used one to distinguish cases from controls

(referred to as “binary” model), and the other to assign cases to distinct diseased states

(referred to as “three-class” model). The latter was particularly important and clinically

relevant due to the clinical overlap in presentation of these diseases, as well as the risk of

IBD patients to eventually develop CRC. We evaluated the performance for the binary

models on the 685 controls and 963 cases through 10-time 10-fold cross-validation, and

model with the combined profile attained a highest accuracy (Figure 5b). Surprisingly but

expected, models using only the marker species/pathways performed comparable to

those that used all species/pathways, especially the combined-based model (Figure 5b),

suggesting that the much-shortened list of markers are of practical and clinical value.

Surprisingly, all three-class

out-performed taxonomic-based models (Supplementary Figure 11); the combined model

of course performed the best with an overall accuracy of 0.9 (i.e. 90% of patients could be

accurately diagnosed) (Supplementary Figure 11c). Again, we found that models using

only the markers performed similarly to those using all the data, with an overall accuracy

of 0.89 on the combined species and pathway markers (Figure 5c).

We noticed significant differences among diseases in terms of TP values in the

“three-class” models. In particular, we achieved high accuracies for CRC and CD (99%

and 92% TP rates respectively) (Figure 5c), as compared with the relatively low TP rate

for UC (74%). The latter was likely due to the fact that UC shared most of its markers with

CD and had only few unique markers; consequently, most of the misclassified UC cases

were predicted as CD (Figures 1a & 5, Supplementary Figure 5). These results suggested

that additional information other than fecal metagenomics, such as physiological, genetic

and clinical information of the human hosts are required to further improve the prediction

accuracies.

Conclusions
In this study, we collected fecal metagenomics datasets for three common intestinal

diseases, namely colorectal cancer (CRC), Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis

(UC), totaling 11 projects, 13 datasets, 963 patients and 685 controls. We selected these

diseases because they all have strong associations with gut microbiota dysbiosis, share

clinical presentations and are pathogenically linked, i.e. both UC and CD patients are at

high risk of developing CRC. We performed meta-analysis and identified in total 65

marker species and 74 marker pathways that were significantly changed in the same

direction (i.e. case-depleted or case-enriched) in at least two independent studies of the

same disease. We clustered the marker species into disease-specific and mixed clusters

according to whether or not the member species were unique to a certain disease, and

revealed their distinct phylogenetic relationships: for example, member species of the

disease-specific clusters are often closely related and belong to the same genus or family

and can form a single clade on the NCBI taxonomic tree; conversely, although species of

the mixed clusters can also form a single clade, they are much more diverse and have the

last common ancestor of the phylum or kingdom level. Strikingly, UC- and CRC- specific

species are phylogenetically closer to each other than to those of CD (Figure 2), in part

due to the fact that UC-patients are at higher risk of developing CRC [9].

We then characterized the marker pathways. We first revealed that almost all marker

pathways correlated significantly with marker species (Figure 3 & Supplementary Figure

6); additionally, clustered marker species tended to correlate significantly with the same

sets of pathways (Figures 2&3). These results were not unexpected since marker species

that are closer phylogenetically tend to have similar metabolic capacities. We then noticed

strong correlations between a significant proportion of marker species and human DNA

contents (HDCs). HDC has been shown to be significantly increased in many intestinal

diseases, and could be used as an indicator for the extent of leaky gut caused by

compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) (Supplementary Figure 2). The elevated HDCs in all

datasets may signify significant changes in physio-metabolic properties of the local gut

environment due to leaked human derived contents under diseased states. Our results

thus suggested that human derived contents due to CIB could have stronger impact on

“four-class” model could separate samples into controls (presumably healthy) or individual

diseases (Figure 5a), with an overall true-positive rate (TPR) of 0.77. UC has the lowest

TPR (0.58, Figure 5a) in this model; however, most of the wrongly classified samples went

to CD, consistent with previous efforts [25] and the fact that UC had very few unique

markers and shared most of its marker with CD (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 5).

Regardless, it represents one of the best models that could classify IBD subtypes with

TPR as 0.58 and 0.89 separately in UC and CD samples, while in a previous study TPR

from the cross-validation model built on the abundance of metabolites and species only

achieved 0.49 and 0.66 in UC and CD respectively [25]. We also built two additional

models, including a “binary” model to distinguish cases from controls, and a “three-class”

model to assign cases to distinct diseased states (referred to as “three-class” model). In

our opinion, both are relevant in clinical applications. For example, the binary model, with

metagenome-based multi-disease classifications. The few selected marker species and

pathways had similar performances to all the taxonomic and metabolic features, and

could be easily translated to clinical uses. Our meta-analysis methods and cross-disease

comparisons improved our understanding on the differences and relationships among

common intestinal diseases that could have similar clinical symptoms; and could be

expanded to include more gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and

colon polyps.

Methods
Data collection

Raw sequencing reads

of the seven

colorectal cancer and four inflammatory

bowel

disease datasets, were retrieved from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the

following ENA identifiers in order: PRJEB6070 [22], PRJEB27928 [34], PRJEB12449 [47],

PRJEB10878 [26],

PRJEB7774 [48], PRJDB4176 [34], PRJNA447983 (cohort1) [34],

SRP057027 [24], PRJEB1220 [49], PRJNA400072 [25] and

PRJNA389280

[28]. We

obtained metadata from the corresponding studies. In total 863 patients and 675 controls

were included in the meta-analysis. For detailed analyses, we split two IBD projects into

two CD datasets and two UC datasets. In total we obtained three UC datasets, three CD

datasets and seven CRC datasets. Details of the datasets and associated meta-data are

provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Truseq3 adapter files and a MINLEN cutoff of 50 [50]. To detect and remove human DNA

contents (HDCs), we aligned the remaining reads to the human reference genome (hg19)

using bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.3) [51] with default settings, and computed HDC as the

percentage of mapped reads out of total remained reads in each sample. The subsequent

reads were then quantified in taxonomic and functional levels via using MetaPhlAn2

mapping to mpa_v20_m200 database and HUMAnN2 mapping to ChocoPhlAn database

and full UniRef90 database [52, 53].

In each dataset, species with max abundance <0.1% in all samples and species

whose average abundance across all samples below 0.01% were removed. Pathways

with maximum relative abundances below 1×10-6 in all samples and with zero value in

over 15% samples were removed. The abundance data were then loaded into R and

analyzed (https://www.r-project.org; version 3.5.1).

Statistical analyses

Shannon index as overall composition in per dataset

was calculated using diversity

function in vegan package. Differences were estimated using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.

We took case-control comparisons on the fecal HDCs in each disease type and examined

significances through the wilcox_test function blocked with “dataset” in coin package.

Univariate analyses on the relative abundances of species and metabolic pathways were

performed to detect significant differential features between cases and controls with a

non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test in each dataset. p-values were corrected using

p.adjust function with method=”fdr. Features with adjusted p-value < 0.05 in the same

direction in at least two studies of the same disease were considered as consistently

taxonomy using an online tool, phyloT (https://phylot.biobyte.de/), setting internal nodes

collapsed and polytomy as no. The tree file then was visualized using Evolview ver3, a

webserver for annotation and management phylogenetic trees [54]. The nodes were

colored depending on their corresponding clusters identified in previous section. The last

common ancestors were determined according to the NCBI taxonomy of the species in

markers showed distinct prevalence

profiles in patients and controls. a. Microbial markers and their trends (i.e. case- or

control- enriched) in common intestinal diseases. Species significantly enriched in cases

(or controls) in at least two datasets of corresponding disease are shown (fdr < 0.05,

Wilcoxon rank sum test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction), with their phylum shown

on top. Red indicates case-enriched species, and blue indicates control-enriched one. b.

Clustering of case-enriched microbes according to their Jaccard similarity of prevalence in

all cases. The clustering was generated using the hclust function of R with the ward.D2

algorithm (see Methods); red indicates higher similarity of prevalence and white indicates

higher divergence. The five clusters were named according to their members; UC-, CD-

disease-specific

markers,

while

Mixed

contained markers from at least two diseases. c. The barplot shows the fraction of cases

that are “positive” for given clusters in per disease type. Here positive samples for a given

species

were

assessed

via

Crochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with ‘dataset’ as the stratified factor; the ‘star’ symbols on

the bars were used to indicate that marker species of a given cluster were significantly

more prevalent in cases than in their corresponding controls ( *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01).
