Abstract

19

Background:

20

Growth curve modelling such as trajectory analysis is useful for examining the longitudinal

21

nature of depressive symptoms, their antecedents and later consequences. However, issues in

22

interpretation associated with this methodology could hinder the translation from results to

23

policy changes and interventions. The aim of this article is to provide a “model interpretation

24

framework” for highlighting growth curve results in a more interpretable manner. Here we

25

demonstrate the association between childhood trauma and trajectories of depressive

26

symptoms. Childhood trauma has been shown to a be strong predictor for later depression,

27

but less is known how childhood trauma has an effect throughout adolescence and young

28

adulthood. Identifying when childhood trauma (and its severity) is likely to have its greatest

29

impact on depression is important for determining the timing of interventions for depression.

30

Methods:

31

We used data on over 6,500 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and

32

Children (ALSPAC) to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms between the ages of 11

33

and 24. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short mood and feelings

34

questionnaire (SMFQ) across 9 occasions. Childhood trauma was assessed between the ages

35

of 5 and 10 years old, and we estimated population averaged multilevel growth curves of

36

depressive symptoms for exposure to trauma (yes vs no) and then in a separate model, the

37

number of trauma types reported such as inter-personal violence or neglect (coded as 0, 1, 2,

38

3+). We then calculated what the depressive symptoms scores would be ages 12, 14, 16, 18,

39

20, 22, 24, between these varying trajectories.

40

Results:

41

Reported exposure to childhood trauma was associated with less favourable trajectories of

42

depressive symptoms across adolescence, mainly characterised by exposed individuals

43

having worse depressive symptoms at age 16. There was an exposure-response relationship

44

between the number of childhood traumas and trajectories of depressive symptoms.

45

Individuals exposed to 3 or more types of trauma had substantially steeper and less

46

favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms: becoming worse at a more rapid rate until the

47

age of 18. By age 18, individuals that reported the greatest exposure to trauma (3+ types of

48

trauma) had 14% more depressive symptoms compared to non-exposed participants.

49

Limitations:

50

This study was subject to attrition, particularly towards the latter ages of the SMFQ.

51

Conclusion:

52

Childhood trauma is strongly associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive

53

symptoms across adolescence. Individuals exposed to multiple types of inter-personal

54

violence or neglect are at the greatest risk of worsening depressive symptoms throughout

55

adolescence and young adulthood. Individuals exposed to traumatic experiences in childhood

56

should be identified as at high risk of depression and other adverse outcomes as early trauma

57

may disrupt social development and have lasting consequences on mental health outcomes.

58

The model interpretation framework presented here may be more interpretable for

59

researchers, clinicians and policy makers as it allows comparisons of depression across

60

multiple stages of development to highlight when the effects of depression are greatest.

1. Introduction
Growth curve modelling is useful for examining the longitudinal nature of depression

63

across development (Musliner, Munk-Olsen, Eaton, & Zandi, 2016; Sutin et al., 2013).

64

Growth curve models allow researchers to estimate trajectories that describe patterns of

65

change in depressive mood over time. These are potentially more useful than analysis of data

66

from any single occasion, as it is possible to estimate the longitudinal nature of depression

67

across periods of development. Furthermore, it is possible to examine the antecedents of

68

varying trajectories of depressive symptoms (Ferro, Gorter, & Boyle, 2015a; Ge, Natsuaki, &

69

Conger, 2006; Mazza, Fleming, Abbott, Haggerty, & Catalano, 2010), their later

70

consequences (Whalen et al., 2016; Yaroslavsky, Pettit, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Roberts,

71

2013), their relationship with other co-occurring traits (Marmorstein, 2009; Mumford, Liu,

72

Hair, & Yu, 2013; Wiesner & Kim, 2006) and the identification of critical points that could

73

be translated into preventions and interventions (Kwong et al., 2019). Consequently, growth

74

curve or trajectory analysis is not only a useful tool for research, but also potentially for

75

clinical inference and identifying at risk groups for treatment (Schubert, Clark, Van,

76

Collinson, & Baune, 2017).

77

Methodology exploring trajectories of depressive symptoms has been increasingly

78

used in recent years (Musliner et al., 2016; Schubert et al., 2017; Shore, Toumbourou, Lewis,

79

& Kremer, 2018). However, much of this research has yet to impact on policy and clinical

80

inference, which could be a result of difficulties in translating findings to inference.

81

Estimating trajectories of depressive symptoms can be done in several ways: one approach is

82

to plot the mean scores by age and depressive symptoms and compare differences at each age

83

(i.e., with a t-test/ANOVA). However, one problem with this approach is that there may be

84

different samples at the various ages, and this can lead to biased estimates with missing data.

85

A more popular approach is to stratify population trajectories into multiple sub-group

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

86

trajectories (e.g., latent classes growth analysis or growth mixture models, see (Muthen &

87

Muthen, 2000)). An alternative approach is to estimate population-averaged trajectories, with

88

individuals being allowed to vary around this population average (e.g., multilevel growth-

89

curves and structural equation models, see (Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006)). These latter

90

approaches quantify the degree of change, making them useful methods for estimating how

91

depression changes over a certain period of time, and what might predict this change. These

92

two approaches are somewhat similar but can produce different results and interpretations,

93

thus harmonising results from both analyses is challenging and could impact on how

94

clinicians and policy makers interpret and implement these findings.

95

One issue with the longitudinal analyses of depressive mood is that depression

96

fluctuates and is characterised by periods of rapid growth and varying ages of onset (Ferro,

97

Gorter, & Boyle, 2015b; Kwong et al., 2019), especially during heightened risk periods such

98

as adolescence (Thapar, Collinshaw, Pine, & Thapar, 2012). In many studies, modelling

99

trajectories of depressive symptoms and the subsequent interpretation is complex. For

100

example, changes in depression are rarely linear. Studies may typically use higher order

101

polynomials to model non-linear trajectories (e.g., quadratic and cubic functions of age),

102

which can result in complicated model estimates (positive quadratic terms but negative cubic

103

terms etc). This can be difficult for researchers and clinicians to interpret and inform policy

104

and practise. Therefore, it is important to find alternative ways to highlight results from

105

trajectory methods. An example of this has been demonstrated in longitudinal assessments of

106

autistics traits (Mandy, Pellicano, St Pourcain, Skuse, & Heron, 2018). Here, Mandy and

107

colleagues estimated differences in the predicted autistic traits scores between male and

108

female trajectories at several ages.

109
110

This approach could be beneficial when applied to the longitudinal study of
depressive symptoms. It is often important to not only highlight the course of depression over

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

111

time, but also when differences may be occurring and whether two or more trajectories (i.e.,

112

exposed to trauma vs not exposed to trauma) differ at a certain age or stage of development.

113

The results in many studies highlighting differences between trajectories are not straight

114

forward, as the presented estimates are typically the estimated coefficients of polynomials

115

and the coefficient of each term in the polynomial is hard to interpret in isolation. More

116

clarity in this area could assist clinicians and policy makers to understand the implications of

117

results from analyses of trajectories of health outcomes. Therefore, the first aim of this study

118

is to highlight how the results from these analyses can be made more interpretable to

119

researchers, clinicians and policy makers by presenting an alternative model interpretation

120

framework to highlight results that show the depressive symptoms scores of different

121

trajectories at different ages.

122

One of the most useful applications for growth curve modelling is to examine how

123

early antecedents or risk factors may predict the trajectory of depressive symptoms over time.

124

Here, we use the example of exposure to childhood trauma to examine its association with

125

depressive symptoms across adolescence and young adulthood. Childhood traumas is a key

126

predictor for adolescent and young adulthood depression (Copeland et al., 2018; Lewis et al.,

127

2019; Sara & Lappin, 2017), yet its effect on depression throughout the course of adolescence

128

and young adulthood is still not clear.

129

Latent class analysis has found that exposure to abuse before the age of 18 years old is

130

associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms (Olino, Klein,

131

Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seeley, 2010). Here, Olino and colleagues found that individuals who

132

scored higher on a scale of childhood adversity and abuse has increased odds of belonging to

133

the ‘persistent’, ‘increasing’ and ‘initially high’ trajectories, but interestingly not the ‘later

134

onset’ trajectory of depressive symptoms. Maltreatment in childhood has also been associated

135

with steeper trajectories of depressive symptoms, and those who experienced sexual abuse

136

younger were more likely to have trajectories that started off higher, but then reduced over

137

time (Carlson & Oshri, 2018; Keane, Magee, & Kelly, 2018). These results suggest that the

138

effects of childhood trauma may have more damaging effects during the formative years of

139

adolescence, as opposed to an increased risk of depression at a later age. There is also

140

evidence to suggest that more stressful life events in childhood are associated with higher

141

trajectories of depressive symptoms in other longitudinal studies (Fernandez Castelao &

142

Kroner-Herwig, 2013; Lee, Wickrama, Kwon, Lorenz, & Oshri, 2017; Stoolmiller, Kim, &

143

Capaldi, 2005; Weeks et al., 2014). However, in many of these studies, depressive symptoms

144

are not measured across the entire period of adolescence and therefore the true longitudinal

145

nature of childhood trauma on trajectories of depressive symptoms is not known.

146

For population averaged trajectories, there is less evidence that negative life events in

147

childhood may impact on trajectories of depressive symptoms. However, recent studies have

148

found that adverse childhood experiences including abuse and neglect were associated with

149

less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms (Barboza & Dominguez, 2017) and that

150

increased stressful life events were associated with a steeper slope for trajectories of

151

depressive symptoms across adolescence (Adkins, Wang, Dupre, van den Oord, & Elder,

152

2009; Ge, Lorenz, Conger, Elder, & Simons, 1994).

153

Identifying when childhood trauma is likely to have its greatest impact on depression

154

throughout adolescence and young adulthood is important for indicating when interventions

155

and support may be most beneficial. Currently, there is a paucity of knowledge on when

156

childhood trauma is likely to have the greatest impact on trajectories of depressive symptoms.

157

There is also some evidence to suggest that negative life events such as trauma and stressful

158

life events are not associated with worsening trajectories (Mazza et al., 2010; Sallinen,

159

Rönkä, Kinnunen, & Kokko, 2016). However, we note that in one of these studies, negative

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

160

life events were assessed by parental report (Mazza et al., 2010), which could lead to an

161

underreporting of the exposure.

162

Research has also yet to focus on how the number of traumatic experiences may

163

predict the longitudinal nature of depression. There is some evidence to suggest that the

164

number of stressful life events may explain the extent to which the risk of depression is

165

increased by exposure to trauma. More than two stressful life events early in childhood have

166

been associated with higher trajectories of depressive symptoms (Weeks et al., 2014).

167

However, little is known about traumatic experiences in childhood and later trajectories of

168

depression. Life-course models suggest that an accumulation of negative events may be more

169

harmful than traumatic exposure on a single occasion (Dunn, Soare, et al., 2018). It is

170

therefore important to examine if the number of childhood traumatic experiences might

171

differentially predict varying trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence.

172

Thus, the second aim of the current study is to build upon previous research by

173

examining the association between childhood trauma and trajectories of depressive symptoms

174

across adolescence and young adulthood. We are also interested in extending previous

175

research by investigating how this association might change depending on the number of

176

childhood traumatic experiences.

2. Method

179

2.1. Study sample

180

We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC),

181

a birth cohort that recruited pregnant women residing in Avon, UK with expected dates of

182

delivery 1st April 1991 to 31st December 1992 (Boyd et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013). The

183

initial cohort consisted of 14,062 children and all participants provided written informed

184

consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and

185

the Local Research Ethics Committees. The study website contains details of all the data that

186

is available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool:

190

2.2. Measures

191

2.2.1. Depressive symptoms

192

Self-reported depressive symptoms were measured on nine occasions between ages 10

193

and 24 using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ) (Angold, Costello, Messer,

194

& Pickles, 1995). The SMFQ is a 13-item questionnaire that measures the presence of

195

depressive symptoms in the last two weeks and was administered via postal questionnaire or

196

in clinics. Each item is scored 0,1 or 2, resulting in a summed score between 0-26. The

197

SMFQ correlates strongly with clinical depression (Thapar & McGuffin, 1998; Turner,

198

Joinson, Peters, Wiles, & Lewis, 2014) and has been used to explore trajectories of

199

depressive symptoms in other studies (Kwong et al., 2019; Mahedy et al., 2017; Rice et al.,

200

2018).

204

2.2.2. Trauma
Two measures of trauma were used for this analysis derived from previous analysis

205

(Croft et al., 2018; Houtepen, Heron, Suderman, Tilling, & Howe, 2018): (1) A binary

206

measure of inter-personal violence and neglect during mid-childhood (age 5-10.9 years;

207

[no=0; yes=1]) and (2) the number of trauma types reported during mid-childhood (0, 1, 2 or

208

3 or more [3+]). Briefly, these variables were derived from 121 self-report and parent report

209

questions about traumatic experiences. The data used to create these variables were taken

210

from multiple trauma questions collected from both parents and children regarding exposure

211

to sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, domestic violence and

212

bullying.

213

2.2.3. Confounders

214

The following confounders were included based upon previous literature examining

215

early social risk factors and trajectories of depressive symptoms (Kingsbury et al., 2016;

216

Kwong et al., 2019; Mahedy et al., 2017): sex (coded as a dummy variable for being female

217

[male = 0; female =1]), maternal postnatal depression (no vs yes), maternal socioeconomic

218

status at birth (manual vs non-manual), maternal educational attainment at birth (A-level or

219

higher vs O-level vs < O-level) and parity (1st born vs 2nd born vs 3rd born or more).

221
222

Insert Table 1 Here
2.3. Statistical methods
Trajectories of depressive symptoms were estimated using multilevel growth-curve

223

modelling (Hedeker & Gibbons, 2006; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Briefly, multilevel

224

growth-curve models estimate population averaged trajectories, with individual level

225

trajectories varying around these population averages (i.e., each person can have their own

226

trajectory that deviates from the average for their population). Descriptive statistics and

227

previous analysis on this data has shown that change in depressive symptoms over time is

228

non-linear (Kwong et al., 2019). To model this non-linearity, a multilevel quartic age

229

polynomial growth-curve model was chosen in line with previous research using higher-order

230

age polynomials for examining trajectories of depressive symptoms (Ferro et al., 2015a;

231

Kwong et al., 2019; Rawana & Morgan, 2014). Age was first grand-mean centred around

232

16.53 years (the mean age of all assessments) in order to improve interpretation (Ferro et al.,

233

2015a; Kwong et al., 2019; Rawana & Morgan, 2014), since model intercept and intercept

234

variance then correspond to the middle of adolescence. Model fit was assessed using

235

likelihood-ratio tests and information criteria, consistent with other studies using multilevel

236

growth-curve models (Singer & Willett, 2003).

237

We ran separate models to examine the association between each trauma variable and

238

these trajectories of depressive symptoms. The first model examined population-averaged

239

trajectories for the exposure to trauma (no vs yes) by interacting the fixed-effects quartic age

240

polynomial terms with the “any trauma” dummy variable. This produced two trajectories of

241

depressive symptoms corresponding to the sub-populations with and without trauma. The

242

second model repeated this approach by entering dummy variables representing the number

243

of traumatic experiences (1, 2 and 3+). In all the analyses, the quartic polynomial age terms

244

varied randomly across individuals to capture each individual’s unique trajectory.

245

We then predicted depressive symptoms scores at each of the following ages: 12, 14,

246

16 18, 20, 22 and 24, separately for each population averaged trajectory. We used the delta

247

method to compare these predicted scores across the different trajectories at each of these

248

ages.

249

All analyses were conducted using Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA)

250

using the user-written runmlwin command (Leckie & Charlton, 2013), which calls the

251

standalone multilevel modelling package MLwiN v3.01

252

(www.cmm.bristol.ac.uk/MLwiN/index.shtml). We note that MLwiN can also be called

253

within R using the R2MLwiN package (Zhang, Parker, Charlton, Leckie, & Browne, 2016).

254

For the analysis using the delta method, non-linear comparisons were estimated using the

255

‘nlcom’ command in Stata. Model equations and additional information are provided in the

256

supplementary materials for further interpretation. To facilitate replication, annotated Stata

257

code can be found here: https://github.com/kwongsiufung.

258

2.3.1 Missing data

259

Missing data in the repeated measures data were handled using full information

260

maximum likelihood (FIML), which assumes that data are missing at random (Little &

261

Rubin, 2019). This means that once we account for the series of depressive symptoms scores

262

and any covariate information that we do observe on a subject, the probability that they are

263

missing in the data at any occasion does not depend on their unknown level of depressive

264

symptoms at that occasion. Previous analysis has found that FIML is an appropriate method

265

for handling missing data when examining trajectories of depressive symptoms (Kwong et

266

al., 2019). Likewise, previous research has shown that there is no substantive change in the

267

model estimates when removing individuals with more extreme missing data patterns

268

(Kwong et al., 2019; Lopéz-Lopez et al., Forthcoming). We therefore include individuals in

269

our analysis with at least one measurement of depressive symptoms in order to increase

270

power to detect an association between the various trauma types and depressive symptoms.

3. Results

272

3.1. Sample characteristics

273

Participant demographics are described in Table 1. Additional descriptive statistics

274

and reliability measures for the SMFQ are described in Supplementary Table 1. There were

275

6,711 individuals with data on the number of traumas, at least one measurement of depressive

276

symptoms and all confounders. The interpretation of the results did not vary substantially

277

with the inclusion of confounders, thus only the adjusted analysis are reported here.

278

Unadjusted analyses are reported in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.

279

3.2. Direct model output vs alternative model parameterisation

280

Estimates from each trauma model can be parameterised in two ways. As the trauma

281

variables were coded as dummy variables for both any trauma variable (coded as 0/1) and

282

number of traumas (coded as 0/1/2/3+), the 0 coded dummy variable can be thought of as the

283

baseline trajectory. Therefore, the effect of trauma (being coded as 1) or the number of

284

traumas (coded as 1/2/3+) are ‘added’ onto the baseline trajectory to represent the effect of

285

having any trauma/number of traumas. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the direct model output

286

shows the intercept and age term coefficients in the dummy variable regression format.

287

However, it is also possible to calculate an alternative parameterisation of the model in a

288

more interpretable manner by showing the complete trajectory estimates for an individual

289

with no trauma compared to an individual with trauma or the number of traumas. This is

290

achieved by adding the coefficient of the trauma variable onto the coefficient of the reference

291

variable which then calculates the intercept or age terms for each distinct population

292

trajectory.

294

As shown in Figure 1, individuals exposed to trauma (between ages 5-10) had worse

295

trajectories of depressive symptoms compared to those who had not experienced trauma.

296

Both trajectories increased throughout adolescence until the age of 18, where symptoms

297

decreased. However, symptoms then began to rise again from the age of 22. The main

298

differences between the two trajectories were characterised by individuals exposed to trauma

299

having a higher intercept1 at age 16 (β = 6.4, SE= 0.13 [95% CI: 6.15, 6.65]) compared to

300

non-trauma exposed individuals ((β = 5.17, SE= 0.11 [95% CI: 4.96, 5.38]; pdiff < .001).

301

There was a weak association between individuals exposed to trauma and the linear age term

302

(β = 0.38, SE= 0.03 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.43]), compared to non-trauma exposed individuals (β =

303

0.32, SE= 0.02 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.36]; pdiff = .09), which suggested that individuals with

304

trauma may have higher linear growth. However, there was no association between the

305

remaining age terms (e.g., quadratic, cubic and quartic age terms) and the non-trauma and

306

trauma exposed individuals (psdiff = .11), implying that overall growth was not substantially

307

different between the two trajectories. Full estimates are shown in Table 2.

3.4. Association between the number of types of trauma and trajectories of depressive

310

symptoms

311

As shown in Figure 2, there was an exposure-response relationship between the

312

number of types of traumas (between ages 5-10) and later trajectories of depressive

313

symptoms, with a tendency for more traumatic experiences in childhood to be associated with

314

steeper trajectories of depressive symptoms. All four trajectories increased throughout

315

adolescence and began to decrease from about the age of 18 and all trajectories again began

316

to rise from the age of about 22. These differences between trajectories were mainly

Intercepts were centered to 16.53 years, the grand mean age. Centering the intercepts is common practice
and allows for easier interpretation (Kwong et al., 2019).

characterised by individuals who experienced no trauma having a lower intercept score at age

319

5.9, SE= 0.15 [95% CI: 5.61, 6.18]; pdiff < .001), two traumas (β = 6.87, SE= 0.23 [95% CI:

321

322

traumas and the linear age term (β = 0.43, SE= 0.06 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.54]), compared to non-

323

trauma exposed individuals (β = 0.32, SE= 0.02 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.36]; pdiff = .05), which

324

suggested that individuals exposed to two traumatic experiences may have higher linear

325

growth. There were no associations between the remaining age terms and the non-trauma,

326

one trauma and two traumas exposed individuals (psdiff = .13), suggesting that overall growth

327

of the trajectories did not differ substantially between no trauma and the one/two traumas

328

trajectories. There were also associations between individuals exposed to three or more types

329

of traumatic experiences and the linear (β = 0.51, SE= 0.09 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.67]), quadratic

330

(β = -0.2, SE= 0.03 [95% CI: -0.26, -0.15]), cubic (β = -0.009, SE= 0.002 [95% CI: -0.01, -

331

0.005]) and quartic age terms (β = 0.004, SE= 0.001 [95% CI: 0.003, 0.005]), compared to

332

the linear (β = 0.32, SE= 0.02 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.36]; pdiff = .03), quadratic (β = -0.1, SE= 0.01

333

[95% CI: -0.11, -0.08]; pdiff = <.001), cubic (β = -0.004, SE= 0.001 [95% CI: -0.01, -0.003];

pdiff = .05) and quartic age terms (β = 0.002, SE= 0.0001 [95% CI: 0.001, 0.002]; pdiff =

335

<.001) for those individuals who were not exposed to any trauma respectively. This

336

suggested that individuals exposed to three or more types of traumas had less favourable

337

trajectories that had a higher rate of change compared to the non-trauma exposed group. Full

338

estimates are shown in Table 3.

341

To aid the interpretation of our analysis we compared predicted depressive symptoms

342

scores at various ages throughout adolescence and young adulthood. We then examined

343

whether these symptoms scores differed by the varying trajectories. To correct for multiple

344

hypothesis testing, we used a Bonferroni adjustment of 0.0012 to estimate corrected main

345

effects between these differences. As shown in Table 4, the predicted depressive symptoms

346

scores at all ages were higher for individuals exposed to any trauma, compared to those who

347

experienced no trauma (psdiff = <.001). The largest difference between these two trajectories

348

occurred at age 20 (β = 1.37, SE= 0.16, pdiff = <.001), which corresponded to a 5.27%3

349

difference in depressive symptoms.

350

Results were comparable for the analysis on the number of traumas with individuals

351

with more types of traumas having greater depressive symptoms score differences compared

352

to those who had experienced no trauma. However, there was no difference in predicted

353

depressive symptoms at age 24 between the no trauma trajectory and those with 1 trauma (β =

354

0.7, SE= 0.23, pdiff = .003 [Bonferroni adjusted]). Likewise, there were no differences

355

between symptom scores for individuals in the one trauma trajectory, and those in the two

356

traumas trajectory at ages 12, 14 and 22 (psdiff > .0.002 [Bonferroni adjusted]), and the one

357

trauma trajectory and the three or more trauma trajectory at ages 12 and 22 (psdiff > .0.002

358

[Bonferroni adjusted]). There were no differences in symptoms scores between the two

359

traumas trajectory and the three of more trauma trajectory at ages 12, 20, 22 and 24 (psdiff >

360

.0.016 [Bonferroni adjusted]). The largest difference between the trajectories occurred

361

between the no trauma trajectory and three or more traumas trajectory at age 18 (β = 3.67,

362

SE= 0.38, pdiff = <.001), which corresponded to a 14% difference in depressive symptoms.

2

The Bonferroni adjustment was calculated by assuming an alpha level of 0.05. We ran 49 statistical
comparisons. Thus, the adjusted Bonferroni corrected level was calculated by 0.05/49 = 0.001. Thus we only
declared comparisons with p-values less than 0.001 as significant at the 5% level.
3
The % difference in depressive symptoms was calculated by taking the predicted difference score (e.g., 1.37)
and dividing it by the total maximum depressive symptoms score of 26 (1.37/26=5.27).

4. Discussion

365

4.1. Main findings

366

We examined the association between childhood trauma and trajectories of depressive

367

symptoms between the ages of 11 and 24 years. We also examined how the number of types

368

of trauma exposure reported during mid-childhood may be associated with higher trajectories

369

of depressive symptoms. One of our main goals was to convey these results in a more

370

interpretable manner that might be beneficial for researchers, clinicians and policy makers.

371

Previous research tends to just display the coefficients from a model, thus making it difficult

372

to interpret results that are non-linear over time. We have provided a framework which easily

373

transforms direct model output into more interpretable coefficients that can be compared

374

across multiple stages of development. Figure 1 demonstrates the utility of this approach.

375

The use of this framework quantifies how different population averaged trajectories vary

376

between each other at varying times (i.e., how no trauma individuals differ from exposed to

377

trauma individuals at age 12 or age 18 etc). We hope that future research will utilise this

378

approach for other trajectory comparisons in the hope of developing and improving

379

treatments and interventions.

380

Exposure to childhood trauma was strongly associated with a steeper trajectory of

381

depressive symptoms. As well as having higher predicted depressive symptoms scores at age

382

16, predicted symptoms scores were also higher between the ages of 12 and 24. However, the

383

growth or rate of change did not change substantively depending on exposure to trauma.

384

Importantly, our analysis on the number of trajectories revealed an exposure-relationship

385

response which demonstrated that a greater number of the types of traumatic experiences in

386

childhood was associated with less favourable trajectories. Whilst the overall rate of change

387

did not differ substantially between those not exposed to trauma and those who reported

388

either one or two types of trauma exposure, individuals exposed to three or more trauma

389

types (i.e., those who are polyvictimised) had a substantively higher rate of change compared

390

to non-exposed individuals. Specifically, polyvictimised individuals had an increased rate of

391

depressive symptoms throughout adolescence, which implies that depression was getting

392

worse more rapidly compared to individuals who did not report exposure to trauma.

393

Importantly, we also observed that depressive symptoms scores were higher at almost every

394

two-year interval for the non-exposed individuals compared to those with exposure to one,

395

two or three or more types of trauma. The greatest difference occurred between the no trauma

396

trajectory and the three or more traumas trajectory at age 18 (corresponding to nearly a 4

397

point or 14% difference in depressive symptoms).

398

These findings support previous research examining the effects of trauma and

399

negative life experiences on later trajectories of depressive symptoms (Barboza &

400

Dominguez, 2017; Carlson & Oshri, 2018; Keane et al., 2018; Olino et al., 2010), and the

401

number of stressful events on higher trajectories (Weeks et al., 2014). These findings are

402

consistent with additional research that suggests that childhood trauma does impact on later

403

depression (Copeland et al., 2018; Lewis et al., 2019) and efforts should be made to prevent

404

traumatic experiences occurring in childhood and support those individuals who are exposed

405

to trauma (Sara & Lappin, 2017). Our research highlights that those most at risk (i.e.,

406

polyvictimised in childhood) have substantially less favourable trajectories of depressive

407

symptoms and efforts should be made to support this at-risk group, potentially through

408

community and individual-level interventions to mitigate or prevent the risk of adverse

409

mental health outcomes post-trauma and throughout adolescence.

410

There are several mechanisms, both psychological and biological, that have been

411

considered to contribute to the pathway from exposure to traumatic experiences to the

412

development of depression. Our findings of the association between exposure to trauma and

413

the trajectory of depressive symptoms may inform theoretical frameworks of these

414

mechanisms. Trauma in early life may have lasting effects on the risk of depression due to its

415

impact during development, and as such reduces the ability to build resilience in adolescence

416

which results in an increased risk of greater depressive symptoms later in life (Copeland et

417

al., 2018; Dunn, Gilman, Willett, Slopen, & Molnar, 2012; Dunn, Nishimi, Gomez, Powers,

418

& Bradley, 2018). Chronic exposure to childhood trauma is associated with repeated

419

victimisation and psychological distress in adolescence (Dierkhising, Ford, Branson, Grasso,

420

& Lee, 2019), and a range of negative functional outcomes in adulthood (Copeland et al.,

421

2018). Previous research has also found that extreme stress during childhood and adolescence

422

may have stronger or longer lasting effects on the HPA axis compared to trauma exposure in

423

adulthood (Lupien, McEwen, Gunnar, & Heim, 2009), and is considered a key mediator in

424

the relationship between trauma and negative mental health outcomes (Heim, Newport,

425

Mletzko, Miller, & Nemeroff, 2008; Owens et al., 2018). Our findings for increased risk of

426

depressive symptoms from exposure to trauma over the course of adolescence is consistent

427

with evidence of sustained dopamine dysregulation from trauma exposure during early life.

428

4.2. Considerations

429

We have transformed the direct model output into two potentially more helpful

430

frameworks which better highlight results and we consider this one of the key contributions

431

of this work. The first is to transform the original model coefficients into a calculated set of

432

alternative estimates: the “Alternative Parametrisation”. This simply adds the baseline

433

intercept and age terms onto the additional groups giving a clearer idea of what depressive

434

symptoms scores are at the intercept age and how they change over a one-year period.

435

However, as the trajectories are non-linear and have multiple age terms, even this can be

436

challenging to interpret, so the second approach is to create predicted depressive symptoms

437

scores at various ages for different population averaged trajectories and to compare them with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

438

degrees of uncertainty. This takes into account the non-linearity of the age terms and

439

represents an easy way to interpret the coefficients from the model. Both these methods

440

improve interpretation from the direct model output and are important to highlight as it is

441

important to know the coefficients for change over time, not just what the scores are at the

442

intercept. Such analysis could be useful for individuals without statistical backgrounds, and it

443

is much easier to interpret a predicted mean difference in symptoms at a particular age, rather

444

than interpreting complex non-linear and contrasting coefficients (e.g., interpreting a positive

445

linear age term but negative quadratic and positive cubic terms). Interpreting these

446

coefficients in isolation is often not practical, but the framework presented in Table 4 and

447

Figure 1 could aid in the interpretation of complex results into clinical practise and treatment.

448

However, there are certain considerations that must be made. Firstly, in this analysis,

449

we chose to use multilevel growth-curve models. Alternative analysis could have used a

450

growth mixture modelling or latent class approach to derive multiple sub-population

451

trajectories and then compared depressive symptom scores at various ages between differing

452

sub-population trajectories (i.e., differences in depression at age 12 between a stable low,

453

increasing and decreasing trajectory). We chose to use a population-averaged approach with

454

quartic polynomials in order to quantify the population averaged rate of change of depressive

455

symptoms associated with exposure to varying degrees of trauma. However, higher order

456

polynomials may constrict the data to take a quartic shape, thus giving estimates that are

457

extrapolated beyond the data. This problem would also be present in the growth mixture and

458

latent class approach. It could be possible to use other functions of time in place of higher

459

order polynomials such as splines and fractional polynomials (Tilling, Macdonald-Wallis,

460

Lawlor, Hughes, & Howe, 2014). However, extrapolation beyond the data is still as issue

461

with these models. Thus, a safer option to account for extrapolation would be to refrain from

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

462

computing estimates close to the tails of the trajectory. This would avoid calculating

463

nonsensical estimates that are beyond the range of the date.

464

A second consideration regards the number of tests that could be run in the framework

465

presented here. As shown in Table 4, we ran multiple comparisons between the no trauma

466

and yes trauma trajectories, and with the no trauma and number of trauma trajectories,

467

resulting in 49 statistical comparisons. Whilst it is important to compare these multiple ages,

468

one concern is that by running multiple sets of analysis, the chances of obtaining a type one

469

error increase (i.e., reporting a sample mean difference to be significant when there is not

470

mean difference in the population: a chance result). Alternatively, such methods may also

471

facilitate research that searches for “statistically significant” differences. This is not the point

472

of such analysis and we advocate the use of Bonferroni adjusted comparisons, or false

473

discovery rates (FDR) to minimise the impact of both scenarios.

474

4.3. Limitations and future research

475

Attrition plays a part in any longitudinal study. Missing data could be biasing our

476

results. Previous analysis using similar methods has shown that when using multiple methods

477

for dealing with missing data, the estimates do not change substantively (Lopez-Lopez et al.,

478

forthcoming; Kwong et al., 2019). To account for this missing data, we used full information

479

maximum likelihood (FIML) which makes a missing at random (MAR) assumption.

480

However, even though we used this approach to account for missing data, we cannot fully

481

rule out the effect of missing data on our results. One alternative approach would be to use

482

multiple imputation where auxiliary variables can be introduced into the imputation model to

483

make the MAR assumption more credible

484
485

Additionally, we only examined childhood trauma between the ages of 5 and 10 years
old. There may be varying effects for traumas at earlier or later ages that could be

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

486

investigated further. However, this was beyond the scope of this study and would likely

487

require advanced modelling techniques, in order to approximately capture the time-varying

488

element of childhood trauma. For instance, childhood trauma may cause depression, but there

489

may also be reverse-causal effects from depressive symptoms on the risk of childhood

490

trauma. Future models should take such modelling into account when examining the

491

longitudinal relationship between childhood trauma and depression. Future research should

492

also consider the timing and accumulation of exposures as these are important for later

493

depression (Dunn, Soare, et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2016). For example, those who have

494

exposure to multiple instances of trauma over consecutive periods of development may be at

495

the greatest risk, but research has yet to explore this.

496

Also, many of the childhood trauma items were parent-reported, which may be

497

subject to report bias. However, sensitivity analyses using this data has found little difference

498

in parent-child reports for trauma (Croft et al., 2018). The measure of exposure frequency

499

used in the study is based on the number of different types of trauma reported, which is only

500

an approximate measure of how chronic trauma exposure is during the age period. There may

501

be variation in the frequency of a single type of trauma exposure and its severity that this

502

analysis is unable to account for. This study also assumes that there is an equal effect of each

503

trauma type on the risk of depression, which may not be the case. These analyses were not

504

the primary focus of this study, however, future research should look to explore the impact of

505

different types of trauma and their associations with later depression as this may help identify

506

at risk individuals, who could be targeted for interventions and treatment.

507

Previous research has also shown that sex differences in child trauma and depression

508

may exist , and evidence suggests that stressful life events increase female trajectories of

509

depressive symptoms, but not males (Adkins et al., 2009; Meadows, Brown, & Elder, 2006).

510

However, the opposite effect has also been observed in another study (Fernandez Castelao &

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

511

Kroner-Herwig, 2013). Sex differences were beyond the scope of this study as we were

512

initially interested in presenting a model interpretation framework for trajectories analysis

513

with a binary and then categorical variable. However, this methodology could be extended to

514

run a three-way interaction between sex, exposure to trauma and varying trajectories of

515

depressive symptoms.

516

In conclusion, exposure to childhood trauma was associated with less favourable

517

trajectories of depressive symptoms. Further to this, there was an exposure-response

518

relationship with the number of reported types of trauma, with individuals exposed to 3 or

519

more childhood traumas having substantially higher trajectories of depressive symptoms.

520

These results suggest that polyvictimised children should be considered at higher risk of

521

depression during adolescence, which could inform intervention approaches. We have also

522

provided an alternative model interpretation framework for examining and comparing

523

trajectories of depressive symptoms, which shows depressive symptoms scores at different

524

ages for different trajectories. This framework could be more interpretable for researchers,

525

clinicians and policy workers, which could eventually aid in the translation of such findings

526

into preventative interventions and treatments.

The no trauma variable should be viewed as the reference category as trauma was coded as a dummy variable (0/1). Thus, the intercept coefficient (and the
coefficients for subsequent age terms) for an individual with trauma are the trauma intercept + yes trauma intercept (i.e., 𝛽0 + 𝛽5 ). The same applies for all
age terms. The Alternative Parametrisation results can therefore be thought of as the calculated scores and therefore the 𝛽𝑥 refer to the direct model output
only. The standard error and p-value correspond to the differences between the trauma estimates and the no trauma differences. The adjusted analysis
included confounders (all entered as main effects) child sex, maternal postnatal depression, maternal education and social economic status at birth and parity.
Intercepts are centred to age 16, the mean age of all assessments

The no traumas variable should be viewed as the reference category as the number of traumas were coded as dummy variable (0/1/2/3). Thus, the intercept
coefficient (and the coefficients for the subsequent age terms) for an individual with 3+ traumas is the no trauma intercept + 3+ traumas intercept (i.e., 𝛽0 +
𝛽15 ). The same applies for all age terms. The Alternative Parametrisation results can therefore be thought of as the completed results. The standard error and
p-value correspond to the differences between the trauma estimates and the no trauma differences. The adjusted analysis included confounders (all entered as
main effects) child sex, maternal postnatal depression, maternal education and social economic status at birth and parity. Intercepts are centred to age 16, the
mean age of all assessments

DS: Depressive symptoms. SMFQ: Short mood and feelings questionnaire. Predicted mean depressive symptom scores calculated at various ages for each
trajectory (standard errors are given in parenthesis). All analysis was Bonferroni corrected (an alpha level of 0.05 divided by the number of statistical
comparisons (49) is therefore 0.05/49= 0.001) to allow for multiple hypothesis testing. * denotes results were not significant at the Bonferroni adjusted level.
