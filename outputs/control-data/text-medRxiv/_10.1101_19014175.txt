Title
[Knowledge and attitudes regarding infant BLS among babysitters and nursemaids in
north rural Jordan]

51

52

Abstract

53

Background: There is a lack of national data related to the public knowledge and attitudes

54

concerning Basic Life Support (BLS) for an infant. This study is the first to assess the

55

knowledge and attitude regarding infant BLS among babysitters and nursemaids who are

56

working in registered nurseries in North Jordan.

57

Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was conducted among a convenience sample of 77

58

child caretakers (babysitters and nursemaids) who were looking after infants in registered

59

nurseries in north of Jordan.

60

Results: The findings show that the majority of participants were not aware of skills for

61

managing foreign body aspiration (or CPR) among infants, while more than two-thirds of

62

them never attended training and or education sessions regarding managing foreign body

63

aspiration among infants.

64

Conclusions: This research strongly recommends training for babysitters and care center

65

staff. The findings of this study indicated that caregivers in Jordanian kindergartens and

66

nurseries lack awareness regarding safe infant care. As such, there is a lack of basic skills for

67

resuscitation in urgent cases; which can increase the risk of sudden and unexpected child

68

death. Accordingly, the infant life support course is highly recommended for babysitters and

69

nursemaids. Health care professionals could help to implement infant basic life support

70

training courses through local community basic service centers, non-governmental

71

organizations, local associations, universities and health colleges through providing

Introduction

79

Approximately 11% of children die each year as a result of a variety of causes including road

80

traffic accidents (RTAs), falls, blast injuries, burns, insect bites, drowning, suffocations, and

81

aspiration.(1) Pediatric cardiac arrest is a life-threatening event, which often is required a fast

82

effective intervention.(2,3) There are more than 5,000 cases of pediatric cardiac-arrests out-

83

hospital annually.(2,3) In particular, one-fifth of total child deaths were due to mechanical

84

suffocation where the child was younger than four years.(3, 4) Dealing with infants' urgent

85

life-threatening situations and providing life support measures may improve infant survival

86

rate. Moreover, the quality of the CPR administered is of paramount importance because it

87

directly affects the infants' hemodynamics, their survival, and the neurological outcomes after

88

the arrest.(3)

89

90

The aspiration of the foreign body is a potentially life-threatening event especially in those

91

under the age of 5 years.(5) An aspirated child can be presented to the emergency as a

92

spectrum, ranging from an event that has no symptoms to more severe events including

93

suffocation, cyanosis, respiratory distress, or even death.(5-7) However, in some cases,

94

previous foreign objects that were topical in the lung can travel back to the mouth and are

95

swallowed, after some severe cough episodes.(7)

The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that children's caregivers should

98

have life support skills and be trained to deal with life-threatening situations.(8) Survival after

99

cardiopulmonary arrest is depending on the effectiveness of the intervention which includes

100

the early management, CPR quality and the time to defibrillation.(9) Babysitters and the local

101

community in Jordan lack awareness regarding safe infant care and basic skills for urgent

102

cases which can increase the risk of sudden and unexpected child death.(10)

103

104

Background

105

Choking and foreign body aspiration remain among the major causes of mortality and

106

morbidity in young children, however, it could be preventable.(4, 5, 6, 11-14) Anyone can be

107

a lifesaver for a cardiac arrest victim with the proper awareness and training.(10, 14, 15)

108

Primary and secondary infant caregivers including parents, babysitters, and nursemaids

109

should have the basic skills for life support to be able to use it when the baby's life is at stake.

110

(10-14) Young children aging between 0 and 3 years, are at the highest risk for accidental

111

suffocation, due to several factors; young children tend to put small things in their mouths and

112

often crying, screaming, running, and playing while such objects are still in their mouths; all

113

of which could be accidentally ingested and cause suffocation. (4) In addition, they do not

114

have molar teeth to chew some foods completely. (4) The most common reported cases of

115

foreign body aspiration are organic or food related, especially when the child begins to eat

116

solid food. (4)

117

118

CPR accurate application depends on experiences, skills, training, and confidence of the

119

rescuer.(12) The American Heart Association released revised CPR recommendations in 2010

120

which state that the compression to breathing ratio is 30:2 for children with one rescuer, and

121

15:2 for children with two rescuers.(12)

Public awareness campaigns and the strict guidelines for toy manufacturers to be within

124

safety requirements in the developed countries have contributed to decreasing the number of

125

childhood deaths due to foreign body aspiration over the past decade.(11) However, in

126

developing countries like Jordan, the public knowledge and skills related to infant basic life

127

support and safety care are still not well established.(1, 10, 13)

128

129

Study significance

130

In Jordan, there is a lack of data related to the public knowledge and attitudes towards Basic

131

Life Support (BLS) for an infant. Therefore, assessing the knowledge and attitudes regarding

132

infant BLS among babysitters and nursemaids who are working in registered kindergarten and

133

nurseries in Jordan is crucial to providing and improving care.This study was the first of its

134

kind in the region that investigated babysitters' and nursemaids' knowledge about Infant BLS

135

and provided basic information which can be used to construct more appropriate and effective

136

intervention programs.

137

138

Aims

139

This study was designed to assess the level of awareness and the attitudes caregivers held

140

towards the practice of BLS for an infant, among registered nurseries in north rural Jordan.

141

METHODS

142

A cross-sectional study conducted during February 2017, child caretakers (babysitters and

143

nursemaids) who were looking after infants in registered nurseries in north state of Jordan. A

144

semi-structured questionnaire was distributed among babysitters and nursemaids who agreed

145

to participate in the study. The questionnaire explored their knowledge, attitudes and

146

perceptions regarding Infant BLS.

Instruments

149

A semi-structured questionnaire was used, which was adapted from a study conducted by

150

Chia and Lian (2014) in Singapore to assess parental knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions

151

towards IBLS.(15) The questionnaire is to collect information about the demographic profile

152

of the participants; knowledge for participants on IBLS skill, and questions of perceptions and

153

attitudes about infant BLS. The questionnaire contains multiple options, True or False

154

questions, and open ended questions. (15)

155

156

Ethical Considerations

157

This study was approved by the concerned institutional review board. All participants signed

158

a consent form after had information about the study and they have been notified that their

159

participation was voluntary and they could withdraw at any time. They were guaranteed

160

anonymity and confidentiality

161

162

Data Analysis

163

Data were analyzed using SPSS 19 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL, USA). Descriptive statistical

164

analysis was used to identify frequencies and percentages of studied categories, and

165

corrolelation between demographical proflile and knowledge regardibg BLS.

166

167

RESULTS

168

A total of 77 babysitters and nursemaids from an eighteen registered nurseries were recruited

169

to participate in the study. The demographic characteristics are presented in Table-1. As seen

170

in the table, approximately half of the participants have a diploma degree (52%), while

171

another third (34%) has a bachelor’s degree, with only 14% having a secondary or less degree

of education. In terms of age groups, around half of the participants (47%) were between 26

173

to 35 years old, while a quarter (26%) were between 36 to 45 years old, followed by (21%) of

174

25 years or less, and only (6%) were more than 45 years old. Lastly, concerning nationality,

175

the majority (70%) were of Jordanian nationality, while the rest (30%) were refugees or

176

migrants.

178

Babysitters' and Nursemaids' Knowledge of IBLS

179

The study investigated babysitters' and nursemaids’ knowledge of the guidelines for IBLS,

180

according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association;

181

including foreign body aspiration and CPR. Table-2 presents the responses related to

182

participants' knowledge regarding IBLS and foreign body aspiration. Based on babysitters'

183

and nursemaids' responses, more than a third of them (38%, n= 29) never heard about CPR

184

for children. Furthermore, the vast majority of participants (70%, n= 54) did not attend the

185

training/education session regarding managing foreign body aspiration. However, 84 percent

186

(n= 65) indicated that they would welcome participating in IBLS if it is offered to them.

187

189

The Proportion of Participants Who Obtained Passing Marks on General Information
for BLS

190

As shown in Table-3, more than one-quarter (27%) of the participants were unaware of the

191

Jordanian ambulance access number. Furthermore, only (66%) of nursemaids and babysitters

192

answered correctly in relation to the child's brain survival without oxygenation (breathing).

193

When asked about the location to check a pulse in a child aged less than one year old, only

194

22% could identify the correct answer.

Additionally, when asked the nursemaids and babysitters about the methods they may use to

197

wake an unresponsive infant, only 44% answered correctly and indicated that they need to tap

198

or flick the infant's feet soles gently. Finally, participants were asked about how they can

199

confirm if the baby is not breathing, about 48% of the participants answered the first item

200

correctly, while correct answers composed 29% for the second item, and 12% for the third

201

item (see Table-3).

202

203

With regards to their knowledge of the correct ratio of chest compression to breath rescue

204

during BLS, only 13% of the participants were aware of the correct ratio compression to

205

breath to provide an effective CPR for an infant with only one rescuer, and 39% indicated the

206

correct answer for providing effective CPR for an infant when two rescuers are available (see

207

Table-3).

208

209

As shown in Table-3, the questionnaire further investigated participants' knowledge about

210

proper interventions to be done in case of infant foreign body aspiration. Four alternative

211

answers were provided with the right answer being “Provide infant of five back blows and

212

five chest thrusts until the object is expelled,” only 21% participants were able to provide

213

correct answer. Another 43% indicated that they should remove the piece aspirated if only

214

were able to see it.

215

The Main Source for the Information about IBLS

216

The majority of study participants, (52%, n=40), indicated that social media was their main

217

source for information regarding BLS. While less than a quarter (21%, n=16) indicated that

218

they learned about IBLS from conferences and training workshops, and only (16%, n=12)

219

learned about it from friends and colleagues. Of the participants, few (12%, n= 9) reported

220

that they access professional journals.

Perception for Confidence Level among Babysitters and Nursemaids Regarding IBLS
Skills

224

The study sample varied in their responses regarding their confidence in providing IBLS and

225

dealing with foreign body aspiration situations. A high proportion of babysitters and

226

nursemaids reported being not confident (42%) or not confident at all (22%). While only 30%

227

of babysitters and nursemaids reported being somewhat confident, and just 6% were very well

228

confident of being able to provide IBLS.

222

229

230

Contrarily, when they were asked about their ability to manage foreign body aspiration in

231

infants, 35% of participants reported being not confident, and another 13% reported being not

232

confident at all. Those who were somewhat confident composed 42% of the babysitters and

233

nursemaids, while only 10% were very confident that they could provide proper intervention

234

if such emergent event happened (see Table-4).

235

236

Furthermore the level of awareness among the babysitters/nursemaid regarding infant BLS

237

was significantly (p<0.01) associated with level of education and age. Babysitters/nursemaid

238

with no university/instition degrees were have less knowledge than babysitters/nursemaid

239

holding college/university degrees. As well babysitters/nursemaid of ageing more than age

240

of 35 have better knowledge, while there is no relation with residencey status (p>0.01).

242

Challenges for Attending IBLS Courses

243

The study participants were asked to indicate their most significant challenge for attending

244

such BLS training courses. The study participants indicated that the major challenge they face

245

for attending IBLS courses was a time limitation due to overload work and busy schedule at

246

nurseries. They also indicated that the long day shift prevent them from engaging in such

247

course, some participants indicated that they only have a one day off work per week and so it

248

difficult to attend these training events. In addition, participants indicated financial

249

difficulties, and transportation difficulties were a challenging factor for attending the IBLS

250

course.

251

Suggestion for getting the training

252

The participants were also asked to choose their more significant way they prefer to receive

253

such training or information about BLS. Less than quarter (21%) preferred the online training

254

courses if it offered. Another 33% chosen face-to-face training, while 53% indicated that they

255

prefer both ways to get the knowledge about BLS, another 3% were unsure about the method

256

to receive such training.

257

258

DISCUSSION

259

This study was conducted among 77 babysitters and nursemaids with the majority having a

260

bachelor’s or diploma degree. The majority of babysitters and nursemaids were not aware of

261

skills for managing foreign body aspiration among infants, and more than two-thirds of them

262

never attended training or education sessions regarding managing foreign body aspiration and

263

CPR practicing among children. However, the majority indicated that they are motivated to

264

participate in such an event if it is offered to them. Significant differences were found in a

265

previous randomized controlled trial study conducted in a tertiary pediatrics' hospital in UK,

266

which aimed to compare the infant CPR technical skill performance among several groups—

267

one which participated in a self-motivated CPR refresher course using a competitive

268

leaderboard, another with a CPR training feedback device, and a final group who did not

269

participate in the course. The results showed that those who chose to participate in the

270

refresher course by self-motivation scored significantly higher than the other groups. The

271

study concluded that self-motivated participation in infant CPR training would help to

272

improve knowledge and skills to manage infants in a critical situation.(16) Furthermore, the

273

level of awareness among the babysitters/nursemaid regarding infant BLS was associated

274

with the level of education and age, while there is no relation with residency status.

275

Babysitters/nursemaid with college or university education level could have a chance of

276

getting information about life support skills through meetings or studying. Also,

277

babysitters/nursemaid with higher ages may have more life experiences.

278

279

One of the alarming findings of the current Jordanian study is that almost two-thirds of the

280

proportion of babysitters and nursemaids were not confident in performing CPR for the

281

infants in case of emergency. Furthermore, they lacked knowledge about the guidelines that

282

they should follow in managing foreign body aspiration among infants. Babysitters and

283

nursemaids were also unaware of how to confirm that a child is not breathing when is

284

unconscious. There is insufficient training or qualification for kindergarten staff, especially in

285

rural areas, where factors such as distance from the city centre may play a role in reducing the

286

opportunities for continuous training of nursery staff. The economic factor could be a

287

challenge, transport costs and training fees may influence the opportunity to get babysitters

288

involoved in such training courses.

289

290

A descriptive study was conducted by Chia and Lain (2014), utilizing a survey questionnaire

291

for knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of parents in Singapore about IBLS.(15) The results

292

of the study showed that IBLS training, as part of basic cardiac life support training, is

293

important given that CPR can significantly alter the outcome in children with

294

cardiopulmonary arrest. The study revealed that knowledge gaps can be filled through official

295

training. It recommended a refreshing course regularly update ' knowledge and skills among

296

child caregivers.(15) Developing such training intervention for babysitters and nursemaids is

297

highly needed in Jordan. Education campaigns have succeeded in part, and primary health

298

care providers can play a crucial role in increasing education efforts about the risk of

299

suffocation and management measures.(17)

300

301

Collaboration between the ministry of health, the ministry of education, the ministry of social

302

development and civil defense in creating programs and policies for enhancing awareness of

303

basic life support skills would be beneficial in accomplishing the mission. More than half of

304

babysitters and nursemaids in this study indicated they use social media to gain information

305

regarding basic life support skills. Using the Internet and adapting online training courses to

306

address this need would be beneficial for targeting babysitters and nursemaids providing a

307

suitable time for them to access the information, as well as being cost-effective by eliminating

308

transportation needs. Value is added when thinking about further benefits of online training

309

courses, such as increasing candidate independence, lowering teacher burden, and

310

maintaining better standardization of course materials; additionally, it would be effective in

311

terms cost.(18) However, first aid online courses may be useful for acquiring knowledge, but

312

maybe not effective for performing BLS skills.(19) Nonetheless, pre-training evaluation of

313

care providers knowledge and skills may be particularly beneficial in improvement BLS skills

314

acquisition immediately after the course of the training.(20) Officials, governmental decision-

315

makers, and stakeholders should support such initiative programs

316

317

The present study had a limitation with regard to the small sample size which affects general

318

claims about all of the babysitters and nursemaids in Jordan. However, conducting this

319

research was highly needed in Jordan, as far it was the first of its kind in the region that

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

324

A majority of the study participants had not attended any CPR or BLS courses. However, it

325

was encouraging that most of them expressed an interest in attending such a training session

326

in the future. It is highly needed that administers run continuous education and training

327

programs on IBLS for babysitters and nursemaids and to provide them with updated

328

information and keep them aware of best practices for dealing with an urgent situation, such

329

as choking that may often occur among young children. Policy changes are needed so that

330

each kindergarten will include a child nurse at each setting; so nurses can lead the

331

development of regular in-service training to improve caregivers' skills through their

332

participation in IBLS courses. This regular and continuous scheduling will minimize any

333

challenges that prevent caregivers form attending IBLS course including time limitation,

334

transportation issues, and financial difficulties. Further, providing such Internet-based

335

resources would help eliminate barriers like cost and transportation. Officials, governmental

336

decision-makers, and stakeholders should support such initiative programs.

337

A special effort could be made to engage the newly graduated students by including them in

338

such repairing courses before they begin working in the nurseries and kindergartens. At the

339

community level, local community basic service centers, non-governmental organizations,

340

local associations, universities and health colleges could support awareness through providing

341

courses that aimed at enhancing knowledge and skills for basic life support among child

342

caregivers and babysitters
