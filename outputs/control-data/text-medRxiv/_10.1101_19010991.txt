Abstract
Objective: To study the role of GBA variants in the risk for isolated rapid-eye-movement
(REM)-sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and conversion to overt neurodegeneration.
Methods: A total of 4,147 individuals were included: 1,061 iRBD patients and 3,086 controls.
GBA was fully sequenced using molecular inversion probes and Sanger sequencing. We
analyzed the effects of GBA variants on the risk for iRBD, age at onset (AAO) and conversion
rates.
Results: GBA variants were found in 9.5% of iRBD patients compared to 4.1% in controls (odds
ratio [OR]=2.45, 95% CI=1.87–3.22, p=1x10-10). The estimated OR for mild p.N370S variant
carriers was 3.69, 95% CI=1.90–7.14, p=3.5x10-5, while for severe variant carriers it was 17.55,
95% CI=2.11–145.9, p=0.0015. Carriers of severe GBA variants had an average AAO of 52.8
years, 7-8 years earlier than those with mild variants or non-carriers (p=0.029). Of the GBA
variant carriers with available data, 52.5% had converted, compared to 35.6% in non-carriers
(p=0.011), with a trend for faster conversion among severe GBA variant carriers. However, the
results on AAO and conversion were based on small numbers and should be taken with caution.
Conclusions: GBA variants robustly and differentially increase the risk of iRBD. The rate of
conversion to neurodegeneration is also increased and may be faster among severe GBA variant
carriers, although confirmation will be required in larger samples. Screening for RBD in healthy
carriers of GBA variants should be studied as a potential way to identify GBA variant carriers
who will develop a synucleinopathy in the future.

Introduction
Isolated rapid-eye-movement (REM)-sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) can be considered a
prodromal synucleinopathy since >80% of iRBD patients will eventually convert to an overt
neurodegenerative syndrome associated with a-synuclein accumulation: Parkinson’s disease
(PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA),1 with a conversion
rate of about 6% a year.2 For unknown reasons, while some iRBD patients convert rapidly,
others can remain free of parkinsonism or dementia for decades.3, 4
Variants in the gene encoding for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, GBA, are
strong and relatively common risk factors for PD 5, 6 and DLB,7 yet their role in MSA is still not
clear.8-10 PD patients who carry GBA variants, as a group, tend to have higher rates of non-motor
symptoms, including RBD, cognitive impairment, hyposmia and autonomic dysfunction.11 GBA
variants can be classified as severe or mild based on the type of Gaucher disease (GD) associated
with the variant.12 Accordingly, patients with severe GBA variants have a higher risk for PD, an
earlier average age at onset (AAO)5 and faster cognitive decline,13, 14 compared to PD patients
with mild or no GBA variants .
Thus far, only few studies with small sample size have examined the role of GBA in
iRBD, including studies of 69,15 17116 and 265 iRBD patients,17 all supporting an association
between GBA variants and iRBD, but with different risk estimates. In addition, it has been shown
that in PD cohorts with available data on probable RBD (pRBD), GBA variants are more
frequent in the group with pRBD.17 However, there are no accurate estimates of the risk for
iRBD among GBA variant carriers, and there have been no studies separately analyzing severe
and mild GBA variants. Furthermore, it is not clear whether GBA variants affect the rate of
conversion from iRBD to overt synucleinopathies, as only two small sample size studies with

contradicting results examined this hypothesis. In one, there was no association with the rate of
conversion in 8 GBA variant carriers with iRBD;15 in the other, a faster conversion was shown
for 13 GBA variant carriers with iRBD compared to non-carriers.18
In this study, we analyzed GBA variants in a large, multicenter study including 1,061
iRBD patients, more than double the sample than all previous studies combined, and 3,086
controls, all of European origin. We further examined the effects of severe vs. mild GBA variants
on risk for iRBD, reported AAO of iRBD, and the potential effects on conversion from iRBD to
an overt neurodegenerative disease.

Methods
Population
The patient population included 1,061 individuals diagnosed with iRBD with videopolysomnography according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 2 or 3
(ICSD-2/3) criteria.19 The recruiting centers and the number of patients from each center are
detailed in Table 1. Additional data were available for subsets of samples, including reported
AAO of RBD (n=594), age at diagnosis of iRBD (n=599), eventual phenoconversion to an overt
neurodegenerative disease (data available for n=584, converted n=218), and rate of
phenoconversion (n=217). The data on these variables were collected in 2018. The control
population included a total of 3,086 individuals, comprised of 1,317 in-house controls of
European origin (confirmed by principal component analysis using available genome-wide
association study [GWAS] data compared to data from HapMap v.3 and hg19/GRCh37), and
additional 1,769 previously published European controls in which GBA was fully sequenced and
all the variants were reported (Supplementary Table 1 details these controls and the reported
GBA variants in each of the papers). The in-house controls had a mean age of 46.5 ± 15.0 years
and included 46.6% men, compared to 60.5 ± 9.9 and 81% men in the patients, therefore when
analyzing these populations, adjustment for age and sex was performed (see statistical analysis
and results).
GBA sequencing and classification of GBA variants
GBA was fully sequenced as previously described,20 and the full protocol is available upon
request. In brief, molecular inversion probes (MIPs) targeting the coding sequence of GBA were
designed, and next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed post capture. Alignment,

variants calling and annotations were done as previously described,20 using standard pipeline.
Exons 10 and 11 were also sequenced using Sanger sequencing, since the coverage of NGS of
these exons was low. Supplementary table 2 details the probes used for the MIPs capture.
Classification of GBA variants as severe or mild was performed as previously described,5, 12
based on the occurrence of these variants in the severe (type II and type III) and mild (type I)
forms of GD. The p.E326K and p.T369M variants, which do not cause GD but have a
comparable risk for that of the p.N370S variants in PD,21, 22 were therefore included in the mild
variant group.
Statistical analysis
To examine the association between GBA variants and risk for iRBD and controls, association
tests (chi-square or Fisher exact test), logistic regression adjusted for sex and age, and burden
tests were used. To examine the association of GBA variants with risk for iRBD comparing all
controls, Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used, since there was no available data on age and
sex from the controls collected from the literature to perform adjusted logistic regression. We
therefore further performed this association using only our in-house European controls for which
data on age and sex were available, using logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex. Of
note, having younger controls may result in under-estimation of the risk, as some of the young
controls with GBA variants may develop iRBD and/or overt neurodegeneration in the future.
Therefore, if the statistical adjustment is not complete, the risk estimations that were calculated
could be slightly lower (i.e. false positive results are not likely, rather under-estimated risk is
likely). We also performed burden tests using the R package SKAT. Association with AAO and
specific types of GBA variants (severe or mild) was tested using the non-parametric KruskalWallis test since the group of severe GBA variants included only five patients. The association

Results
GBA variants are associated with increased risk of iRBD, with differential effects of severe
and mild variants.
The variants in GBA identified in each of the participating centers are detailed in Table 1, with a
total of 17 distinct variants found in patients and controls (Table 2). Supplementary Table 1
details the variants found in each of the previously published control populations. Out of 1,061
iRBD patients, 101 GBA variant carriers (9.5%) were identified, compared to 126 out of 3,086
(4.1%) controls (Table 2, OR=2.45, 95% CI 1.87–3.22, p=1x10-10). We repeated this analysis
using a logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex using the controls with available data
(n=1,317), which yielded very similar results (OR=2.12, 95% CI 1.34-3.36, p=0.001). Burden
tests using the R package SKAT also yielded similar results (p=2.6x10-6 using the in-house
controls and p=1.7x10-12 using all controls). Similar to previous observations in PD, different
GBA variants have different effects on the risk for iRBD. The mild p.N370S variant was found in
20 iRBD patients (1.9%) compared to 16 (0.5%) in the controls (OR=3.69, 95% CI 1.90–7.14,
p=3.5x10-5), while severe variants (p.L444P, p.D409H, p.W291X, p.H255Q and p.R131L) were
found in six (0.6%) iRBD patients and in one (p.L444P, 0.03%) control (OR 17.55, 95% CI
2.11–145.9, p=0.0015). Of the two polymorphisms known to be risk factors for PD, p.E326K
and p.T369M, only p.E326K was associated with iRBD (4.4% vs. 1.5% in patients and controls,
OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.12-4.84, p=6x10-9), and the carrier frequency of p.T369M was only slightly
elevated in iRBD but not statistically significant (1.9% vs. 1.7%, OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.68-1.89,
p=0.6). The carrier frequencies of the p.N370S, p.E326K and p.T369M variants in gnomAD
(https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) European population are 0.4%, 2.4% and 1.9% respectively,
similar to the frequencies in our controls.

Estimated age at onset of iRBD may be affected by the type of GBA variant
AAO as reported by the patients could be an unreliable estimate, and data was not available for
all patients. Therefore, the following results should be considered with caution. Carriers of the
severe GBA variants had an average AAO of 52.8 years ± 2.8 years (data was available for five
out of six patients with a severe GBA variant), carriers of all other variants had an average AAO
of 59.7 ± 9.6 years (data was available for 58 patients), and non-carriers of GBA variants had an
average AAO of 60.6 ± 9.9 years (data was available for 531 patients). Since in the severe
variants group there were only five patients, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was
performed, demonstrating a possible association with the type of variant (χ2=7.083, df=3,
p=0.029).

Do GBA variants affect the rate of conversion of iRBD to overt neurodegenerative
diseases?
Data on conversion of iRBD was available for 59 GBA variant carriers and 525 non-carriers of
GBA variants. Of the GBA variant carriers, 31 (52.5%) had converted, and in non-carriers 187
(35.6%) had converted (p=0.011). Data on time from iRBD diagnosis to phenoconversion or last
follow-up was available for 29 GBA variant carriers and for 276 non-carriers. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis suggested that GBA variant carriers progressed faster but the difference with
non-carriers of GBA variants was not statistically significant (Figure 1A). When severe GBA
variant carriers were compared to mild GBA carriers and non-carriers, a possible association was
demonstrated (Figure 1B; Breslow p=0.017, Tarone-Ware p=0.051, log-rank p=0.24). However,
these results should be interpreted with caution for several reasons: a) They include the cohort

from Montreal in which it was previously reported that GBA variants are associated with rate of
conversion, but it does not include the negative study from Barcelona (data could not be shared).
b) The results are based on a small number of variant carriers (four patients with a severe GBA
variant, 25 with other GBA variants). Therefore, larger studies will be required to conclusively
determine whether GBA variants are associated with the rate of phenoconversion.

Discussion
Our results confirm the association between GBA variants and increased risk for iRBD, and
suggest that severe and mild GBA variants have differential effects on risk, similar to previous
reports in PD.5 Furthermore, our results suggest that iRBD patients with severe GBA variants
may have earlier AAO, and may convert faster to overt neurodegenerative disease. However, the
results on AAO and conversion should be considered as preliminary only and with caution, due
to several limitations discussed below.
Three previous small sample size studies have examined the association between GBA
variants and iRBD.15-17 Two of these studies included full sequencing of the gene,15, 17 and the
third only examined two specific variants (p.N370S and p.L444P).16 Due to their size, analyses
of specific variants or types of variants such as severe or mild were not possible. The current
study includes two of the previously published cohorts,16, 17 and additional cohorts of European
ancestry. With the larger sample size accrued, we were able to demonstrate a much larger risk in
carriers of severe GBA variants. However, given the small numbers of these variants and the
wide range of the confidence interval, the risk estimates may be different in future, larger studies.
Nevertheless, the current results are in line with previous results from PD, which clearly
demonstrated similar relationships between severe and mild GBA variants and risk for PD.5
Furthermore, previous studies have also suggested that the type of GBA variants may affect PD
progression,13, 14 which is further supported by our preliminary findings on AAO and conversion
of iRBD.
In recent years, it has been demonstrated that the two coding variants, p.E326K and
p.T369M, which do not cause GD, are risk factors for PD.21-23 In DLB, the association between
p.E326K and risk for the disease is clear, yet it is still unclear whether p.T369M is a risk factor

for DLB. Only a few studies that examined p.T369M in DLB have been performed, and in most
of them there was no association between p.T369M. A multicenter study which included over
700 DLB patients reported lack of association, and in a GWAS with over 1,700 DLB patients,
only the p.E326K variant was reported to be associated with the disease.7 Conversely, recent data
from 556 DLB patients did suggest an association.24 The lack of association in the current study
in iRBD may also provide further support for lack of association of p.T369M with iRBD and
DLB. However, it is important to keep in mind that the association of this variant with PD was
only reported in much larger studies,21, 22 due to its lower effect on risk compared to other GBA
variants. Only much larger studies can determine conclusively whether p.T369M is associated
with iRBD and DLB. Furthermore, there was a large difference between the frequency of
p.T369M in our in-house controls (2.7%) and the controls from the literature (1.1%), perhaps due
to population structure. However, the combined frequency (1.7%) is comparable to that seen in
the gnomAD European population (1.9%), rendering our results for this variant as likely
unbiased.
Our study has several limitations. The possible association between GBA variants and
rate of conversion reported here, although potentially very interesting, should be taken with
caution. As detailed in the results, they are based on a small number of patients with severe GBA
variants, and include samples that were previously included in a study suggesting a positive
association between GBA variants and rate of conversion. An additional potential limitation is
that the measured duration from age at diagnosis or iRBD to conversion might not reflect the
actual length of disease duration, as patients can remain unaware for many years about their
dream enactment behaviors, especially if they do not have a bed partner or if they do not have
very active or violent dreams. The small number of severe GBA variants is also a limitation in

the risk analysis, as it created a wide confidence interval. However, since the effect of severe vs.
mild variants is in line with previous studies in PD, it is likely that these risk estimates for iRBD
are overall correct, yet the precise estimate might change in future, larger studies.
The mechanisms underlying the association between GBA variants, the enzyme encoded
by GBA, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and the development of neurodegeneration are still
unknown.11 Several mechanisms have been proposed, including interaction of GCase substrates
with a-synuclein which may lead to its accumulation,25 changes in the lysosomal membrane
composition which may lead to reduced autophagy and mitophagy,26, 27 accumulation of
misfolded GCase and endoplasmic reticulum stress,28 and others. The association with iRBD
may suggest that studying these mechanisms in non-dopaminergic neuronal models which are
involved in RBD could lead to new discoveries and better understanding of these potential
mechanisms.
To conclude, our results clearly demonstrate that GBA variants are associated with
increased risk for iRBD, and suggest that severe and mild GBA variants may have differential
effects on the risk, and possibly on AAO of iRBD and conversion to overt neurodegenerative
disease. Due to the limitations mentioned above, the latter associations should be considered as
preliminary, with additional, larger studies on GBA in iRBD required to confirm or refute them.
One important implication of the association between GBA variants and iRBD, is the possibility
to perform screening for iRBD in healthy GBA variant carriers. This may allow for even earlier
detection of prodromal neurodegeneration, and could be especially useful when home detection
of iRBD will be made possible.
