Abstract
Introduction
The major global public health problems now days are diabetes especially the burden is high in
low income countries including Ethiopia due to the limited resource for screening and early
diagnosis of the diabetes. To prevent diabetic complications including organ damage and micro
vascular complications blood glucose level should be maintained at an optimum level. However
there was no pooled national picture on poor glycemic control and its associated factors.
Methods
Different data base searching engine including PubMed, Google scholar, the Cochrane library,
MEDLINE,, HINARY and African journal online (AJOL) were used.

The Joanna Briggs

Critical Appraisal Tools and Newcastle Ottawa scale for assessing the quality of cross sectional
studies were used for quality assessment. The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 14
software. I2

statistic and egger weighted regression were used to assess heterogeneity and

publication bias.
Results
A total of 134 studies were identified from different database searching engines and other
sources. After removing for duplication, absence of abstract and review of the full text 12 studies
were including in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of poor glycemic control among
diabetic patients in Ethiopia is 64.72% with 95% confidence interval 63.16-66.28%. The sub
group analysis of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in different region of the
country shows consistent and high prevalence of poor glycemic control ranging from 62.5% in
Tigray region to 65.6% in Oromia region of the country. Residence, dyslipidemia and diet
adherence were significantly association with poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in
Ethiopia.
Conclusion
The prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients was high in Ethiopia and
consistent across different regions of the country. The most important factors associated with
poor glycemic factor among diabetic patients were being rural residence, having dyslipidemia
and not adhering to dietary plan.
Keywords: Poor glycemic control, diabetes, Fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin,

Introduction
Diabetes is chronic disease occurred due to increased blood glucose level because of the body
cannot produce at all or secrets in sufficient insulin hormone or not use it effectively. Hence,
the nonexistence of insulin or the cell is not sensitive to use insulin leads to increased blood
glucose level which is the hallmark of diabetes(1). Globally 425 million adult population have
diabetes and an estimated of 15.5 Millions of them are living in Africa and it is projected that by
2040 about 34.2 million are expected to be diabetic(2). One of the major global public health
problems now days are diabetes especially the burden is high in low income countries including
Ethiopia due to the limited resource for screening and early diagnosis of the diabetes (3).
To prevent diabetic complications including organ damage and micro vascular complications the
blood glucose level should be maintained at an optimum level because poor glycemic control
leads to diabetic keto acidosis, cognitive impairment, immune dysfunction and hospital
admissions due to May complications. The magnitude of poor glycemic control is high
throughout the world and specifically in Ethiopia greater than 50% of the diabetic patients does
not had optimum blood glucose level(4–7).
Several primary Studies have been conducted in Ethiopia on the magnitude of poor glycemic
control and their associated factors among diabetic patients. However the result of these studies
were not consistent on the prevalence of poor glycemic control and even the factors that have
significant association with poor glycemic control among diabetic patients varies across the
studies. Moreover, there is no a study that shows the national pooled prevalence of poor
glycemic control and contributing factors as well. . Therefore, this systemic review and metaanalysis on poor glycemic control and associated factors in Ethiopia are filling these gap and will
generating new attention on the significant contributing factors to maintain the optimum blood
glucose level among diabetic patients in Ethiopia.

Methods
Study design and search strategy
A systematic review and meta-analysis on the poor glycemic control and associated factors
among diabetic patients in Ethiopia has been conducted. Different data base searching engine
including PubMed, Google scholar, the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, HINARY and African
journal online (AJOL) were used. Besides, grey literature and the reference list of former
studies were also searched for extra articles.

The Boolean operators was used to search the

articles by using the following key and medical subject hedging terms

separately and in

combination “glycemic control” “glycemic control”, “blood glucose control”, “fasting blood
glucose”, “glycated hemoglobin” , prevalence, magnitude, “associated factor”, predictors,
Ethiopia. Language was limited to be only English. From May 2019 up to July 2019 was the
period used to search the studies.
Study selection and eligibility criteria
Study selection
Selection of articles for the systemic review and meta-analysis were if the study conducted in
Ethiopia and studies reporting poor glycemic control and/or the associated factors. Two
independent researchers assessed the abstract and full text of all articles after preliminary
screening of the studies for their title. A third researcher has been resolved the disagreement
between the two researchers. A total of 134 studies were found from database searching and
grey literatures (figure 1).

Eligibility criteria
Inclusion
All articles published until the end of July 2019
Only researches measured the poor glycemic level and/or associated factors among
diabetic patients published and grey literatures were included
Fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test and hemoglobin a one c(Ha1c)
measurement for poor glycemic control according to the standard cut off point were
included
For duplicated articles the most recent were used
Only English language published articles were used
Exclusion
Studies used random blood glucose level to determine poor glycemic control were
excluded
Poor glycemic level that do not adhere to the standard world health organization
definition and international diabetic federation were excluded.
Article that are rated as low quality assessment was rejected.
Studies that have response rate of <80% were excluded
Data extraction
Data extraction form has been developed by two researcher in excel spread sheet format and
appraised by the third author. The data abstraction includes author, year of study, year of
publication, study area(region of the country), study design, study setting( hospital/community
based), sampling technique, sample size, response rate, outcome measured by( fasting blood
glucose/ HbA1c), prevalence of poor glycemic control, age, gender, residence(urban/rural),
monthly income, educational status, occupation, regular follow up, serum lipid level, presence
of comorbidity, duration of disease, physical exercise, medication adherence, diet adherence,
type of diabetes(type 1/type 2), medication(insulin, oral and combined), and body mass index
(BMI) of the study participant were extracted. In addition to the total prevalence of poor
glycemic control and sub categories by region of the country and outcome measured by fasting
blood glucose or hemoglobin HbA1c has been extracted.

Operational definition of outcome measures
Poor glycemic control is the level of blood glucose rages out of the normal value that is Fasting
blood glucose measurement greater than 130mg/dl and less than 70 mg/dl

and glycated

hemoglobin(Ha1c≥ 7%).
Study quality and critical appraisal
Quality of the studies was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tools and Newcastle
Ottawa scale for assessing the quality of cross sectional studies in meta-analysis(8). Parameter
for quality assessment contains sampling procedure, representativeness in terms of their sample
size, response rate, and blood glucose measured by standard measurement tool.
Heterogeneity and publication bias
Cochranes Q test which shows the presence of heterogeneity among studies and I2 statistic were
used to test heterogeneity.

The estimate of variation in effect estimate that is due to

heterogeneity rather than sampling error or chance differences

was evaluated by I2 statistic.

Hence, the presence of heterogeneity was checked by Cochranes Q test ( p<0.10 indicates
statistically significant heterogeneity as cut off point) and the value of I2 test 25%, 50%, 75%
indicates low, medium and high heterogeneity among studies.
To assess for publication bias egger weighted regression and Begg rank correlation test ( p< 0.05
were considered as statistical significant publication bias) method used.
Statistical analysis
The data entry was conducted on Microsoft excel spread sheet for windows 2010 and exported to
STATA version 14 statistical software for analysis. Descriptive summary of the original studies
were conducted and presented in forest plot, tables and texts. Fixed effect model was used to
compute the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence interval of poor glycemic control since
there was no heterogeneity among the articles and random an fixed effect model was computed
to identify the factors that had significant association with poor glycemic control among diabetic
patients in Ethiopia.

Pooled prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients
The pooled prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in Ethiopia is 64.72%
with 95% confidence interval 63.16-66.28. Heterogeneity test was checked in this analysis and it
was I2 =73.8% indicating of no heterogeneity. Egger’s test was used to test for publication bias
and

t-test= -48, p-value = 0.638, hence we declare that there were no publication bias in this

analysis. Figure 2

Subgroup analysis of poor glycemic control by region of the country
The sub group analysis of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in different region of
the country shows consistent and high prevalence of poor glycemic control ranging from 62.5%
in Tigray region to 65.6% in Oromia region of the country. In Amhara region five studies have

Subgroup analysis of poor glycemic control by method of measuring blood
glucose level
The subgroup analysis of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients by the fasting blood
glucose (FBG) and by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shows that there was no difference in the
result of poor glycemic control. Eight studies has been included in quantitative meta analysis of
the systemic review measured by fasting blood glucose and the overall poor glycemic control
measured by FBG was 64.74%. Studies measured the poor glycemic control in the review were
four and the overall poor glycemic contral was 64.68%. Figure 5

Factors associated with poor glycemic control among diabetic patients
To identify factors that have significant association with poor glycemic control among diabetic
patients we had conducted the quantitative meta-analysis of with random and fixed effect model
based on the heterogeneity of the studies and random effect model is the more conservative
method. There were a total of 14 factors investigated for poor glycemic control, among those
only residence, dyslipidemia and diet adherence were significantly associated with poor
glycemic control among diabetic patients in Ethiopia after conducting meta-analysis.

Residence
In the quantitative meta-analysis total of seven studies have been including to identify residence
(rural/urban) as a significant factor associated with poor glycemic control. Fixed effect model
was used because there was no heterogeneity (I2 =0.0%, p=0.43). Being rural residence was 1.74
times more likely to have poor glycemic control among diabetic patients as compared to urban
residences. Figure 6

Discussion
Poor glycemic control among diabetic patients is the major cause of macro vascular and micro
vascular complication and lead to hospital admissions.
In the current systemic review and meta-analysis a total of twelve studies have been used to
summarize the pooled prevalence of poor glycemic control and their associated factors among
diabetic patients in Ethiopia. The overall pooled prevalence of poor glycemic among diabetic
patients was 64.72% and being rural residence, dyslipidemia, and not adhering to dietary plan
were factors that had significant association with poor glycemic control.
The result of poor glycemic control in the current study 64.72% with 95% CI (63.16 – 66.28) is
consistent with study conducted in Jordan 65.1%, (9), India 63% (10),. However the current

finding is higher than a study conducted in china 50.3%(12), Zimbabwe 58.2% (13), Israel
58.4%(14). This discrepancy might be due to the study population characteristics, study design
and the kind of medication they were given. Besides, the pooled prevalence of poor glycemic
control among diabetic patients is lower than a study conducted in Bangladish 82% (19),
manipal/India 78.2%(20), 78.6% , Kenya 91.8%(21), Saudi Arabia 74.9%(22). This variation
could be due to the measurement tool used for the outcome determination.
In the Meta analysis to identify significant factors associated with poor glycemic control among
diabetic patient’s twelve studies has been included. Being rural residence was 1.74 times more
likely to have poor glycemic control as compared to urban residence( OR=1.72, 95%CI
1.39,2.19), this result is in line with a study conducted in Bangladesh(19),. This could be
explained by peoples living in rural residence might have lower awareness, and also may not
have sufficient access to health facility for professional support to maintain their glycemic
control as compared to urban residences(25).
In addition being dyslipidemia was 4.69 times more likely to have poor glycemic control as
compared to the patients having normal lipid level ( OR=4.69, 95%CI 2.51,8.71) this result is in
line with a study conducted by Kakade A. et al 2018 in Mumbai/India(21), systemic review by
mohammad J. et al 2018 in Arabian gulf countries(26),. This could be due to the fact that
continuous entry of fatty acids in to the β-cells of the pancreas creates β-cell lipotoxicity and this
causes pancreases β-cell failure follow on poor glycemic control(27–29).

Similarly finding of this study revealed being no adherent to the dietary plan was 5.45 more
likely to have poor glycemic control as compared to patients that adhere to their dietary paln (
OR=5.45, 95%CI 1.99,14.92) this result is in line with a study conducted by Kakade A. et al
2018 in Mumbai/India(21), systemic review by Mohammad J. et al 2018 in Arabian gulf
countries(26), and Khattab M. et al. 2010 in Jordan(9). This could be due to the fact that diet is
the most important treatment that can modify may aspects of the body physiology including the
pathophysiology of pancreas that secretes the hormone insulin(5).

Conclusion
The prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients was high in Ethiopia and
consistent across different regions of the country. The most important factors associated with
poor glycemic factor among diabetic patients were being rural residence, having dyslipidemia
and not adhering to dietary plan.
