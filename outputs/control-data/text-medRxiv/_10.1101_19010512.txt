ABSTRACT
Background
Current research does not provide a clear explanation for why some patients with Parkinson’s
Disease (PD) develop psychotic symptoms. In the field of schizophrenia research the ‘aberrant
salience hypothesis’ of psychosis has been influential. According to the theory, dopaminergic
dysregulation leads to the inappropriate attribution of salience to otherwise irrelevant or
non-informative stimuli, allowing for the formation of hallucinations and delusions. This
theory has not yet been extensively investigated in the context of psychosis in PD.
Methods
We investigated salience processing in 14 PD patients with a history of psychotic symptoms,
23 PD patients without psychotic symptoms and 19 healthy controls. All patients received
dopaminergic medication. We examined emotional salience using a visual oddball fMRI
paradigm (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006) that previously has been used to investigate early stages

of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, controlling for resting cerebral blood flow as assessed

with arterial spin labelling fMRI.
Results
We found significant differences between patient groups in brain responses to emotional
salience. PD patients with psychotic symptoms revealed senhanced brain responses in the
striatum, the hippocampus and the amygdala compared to PD patients without psychotic
symptoms. PD patients with psychotic symptoms also showed significant correlations
between the levels of dopaminergic drugs they were taking and BOLD signalling, as well as
psychotic symptom scores. Furthermore, our data provide a first indication for dysfunctional
top-down processes, measured in a ‘jumping to conclusions’ bias.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that enhanced signalling in the striatum, hippocampus and amygdala
together with deficient top-down cognitive regulations is associated with the development of
psychotic symptoms in PD which is similar to that proposed in the ‘aberrant salience
hypothesis’ of psychosis in schizophrenia.

Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients frequently suffer from psychotic symptoms, especially as
the disease advances, which most commonly takes the form of visual hallucinations, delusions
and illusions (Aarsland et al, 1999). With disease progression psychotic symptoms may shift
to other modalities such as the auditory domain, comprising auditory hallucinations of
incomprehensible voices (Inzelberg et al, 1998) or non-verbal sounds (Fenelon, 2000). PD
psychosis characterises a spectrum of such psychotic symptoms that occur throughout the
course of the disease, but especially in those with longer disease duration, giving an overall
prevalence of 26% (Mack et al, 2012) (Forsaa et al, 2010; Gibson et al, 2013). Its development
is associated with increased risk for mortality and nursing home placement as well as lower
overall global functioning and well-being (Ffytche et al, 2017).

Current research suggests that PD psychosis combines a set of symptoms with a specific

pathophysiology (comprehensive review (Ffytche et al, 2017)), rather than a single

mechanistic dysfunction. Risk and modulatory factors include genetics, the use of

dopamine-based antiparkinsonian drugs, and disease-specific factors such as cognitive

impairment, dementia, duration and severity, depression, sleep disorders, and age and the

presence of intercurrent infections or illnesses (Fénelon and Alves, 2010; Friedman, 2010).

Although there are clear differences between the primary psychiatric disorder of

(schizophrenia spectrum) psychosis and PD psychosis, a disturbed dopaminergic system is a

unifying element in both diseases, possibly contributing to the occurrence of psychotic

symptoms in both disorders (Carter and Ffytche, 2015; Garofalo et al, 2017). PD psychosis

is particularly interesting as it is commonly found as a comorbidity in PD patients but does

not affect all.
A dysfunctional dopaminergic signal, perhaps in the mesolimbic regions, is argued to be
associated with the inappropriate attribution of salience to otherwise irrelevant or noninformative stimuli, allowing for the formation of hallucinations and delusions; this theory has
been termed the ‘aberrant salience hypothesis’ of psychosis (Heinz, 2002; Kapur, 2003; Roiser
et al, 2013) . Some models propose that within the hippocampal-striatal-midbrain circuits,

hippocampal dysfunction leads to an enhanced subcortical dopaminergic signalling through
descending projections to the dorsal striatum (Lisman and Grace, 2005; Lodge and Grace,
2007). Supporting the involvement of these circuits, a recent study investigating novelty

salience processing reported increased connectivity of hippocampal to striatal and midbrain
regions, but decreased connectivity between the striatum and the midbrain in subjects at high
risk of developing psychosis (Modinos et al, 2019). Furthermore, our previous work in firstepisode psychosis patients, using the same salience paradigm as Modinos et al, showed
reduced midbrain, striatal and occipital activation while processing novelty and negative
emotional salient stimuli (Knolle et al, 2018). In Parkinson’s disease research, the investigation
of salience processing has received comparably little attention. One study showed that the
use of a dopamine agonist (pramipexole or ropinirole) in young, medication-naïve PD patients
led to an increase in aberrant motivational salience by facilitating arbitrary and illusory
associations between stimuli and rewards, and by faster reaction times to task-irrelevant
stimuli (Nagy et al, 2012). Unmedicated patients in that latter study did not suffer from
psychotic symptoms, but had increased scores on the O-LIFE unusual experience score after
treatment with dopaminergic agents (Nagy et al, 2012). Furthermore, another study (Mannan
et al, 2008) suggested impaired salience processing in PD: in an eye-gaze experiment, patients
showed an impaired ability to detect a salient stimulus in a visual search task. No psychotic
symptoms were reported for the patients in that latter study. In our previous work (Garofalo
et al, 2017), we investigated reward processing, a form of motivation salience, in PD patients
with and without psychotic symptoms and in controls. PD patients with psychotic symptoms
showed very similar patterns of reduced activation (including in the striatum and cingulate
cortex) as reported in primary psychosis individuals (Ermakova et al, 2018; Murray et al,
2008).
In this new study we report here, we sought to explore whether the ‘aberrant salience
hypothesis’ of psychosis can be applied to PD psychosis and thus provide an explanation as to
how psychotic symptoms arise in PD patients. To our knowledge, the current study is the first
to investigate brain responses to non-motivational salient visual stimuli in PD psychosis. We
specifically investigated salience processing in PD patients with psychotic symptoms, in PD
patients without psychotic symptoms and in healthy controls. We used an fMRI salience
paradigm (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006) that previously has shown significantly altered midbrain,
striatal, hippocampal and amygdala activations and connectivity in early stages of

“psychiatric” psychosis in young adults (Knolle et al, 2018; Modinos et al, 2019). Based on the
literature and our previous findings, we hypothesised, first, that PD psychosis patients would

demonstrate altered brain responses in the substantia nigra, the striatum, the hippocampus
and the amygdala compared to healthy controls and, second, that PD patients without
psychotic symptoms would show intermediate processing in response to negative emotional
salience.
The aberrant salience theory of psychosis has posited that whilst perceptual salience may be
misattributed in psychosis, higher-order cognitive processes are invoked to shape abnormal
experiences into abnormal beliefs. Whilst our focus in the current study is on brain correlates
of emotional salience processing, in a preliminary analysis we also examined whether higherorder (probabilistic) reasoning is affected in PD psychosis.

Methods
Subjects
In total, we recruited 26 participants, who had a diagnosis of PD without any psychotic
symptoms using established diagnostic criteria; 15 participants with a diagnosis of PD and
ongoing or previous psychotic symptoms, and 19 healthy control subjects, without any history
of neurological or psychiatric disorder, matched in age, gender, education (see Table 1). We
assessed psychotic symptoms in Parkinson’s patients using the Comprehensive Assessment
of At Risk Mental States (CAARMS) (Yung et al, 2005)- also see our previous work (Garofalo
et al, 2017) for a detailed description and Table 1). For two participants, one healthy control
and one PD patient with psychotic symptoms, the fMRI session had to be aborted during
scanning of the relevant task, as both participants felt uncomfortable inside the scanner. Both
participants decided not to continue with the scanning and so were excluded from any
analysis. Additionally, two PD patients without psychotic symptoms were excluded due to
excessive movement artefact in the scanner (see details below). Finally, two outliers were
identified during our analysis, one healthy control and one PD patient without psychotic
symptoms, who exceeded -/+ two standard deviations from the averaged imaging signal in all
regions of interest (ROI). The final sample therefore comprised of 52 participants: 23 PD
patients without psychotic symptoms, 17 healthy controls and 14 PD patients with psychotic
symptoms.

Patients were recruited via the PD research clinic at the John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair
(VGB). All patients met the Queen Square Brain Bank Criteria for idiopathic PD (Gibb and Lees,
1988). Patients with dementia were excluded (mini-mental state score less than 24). In all
cases, the patients anti-PD medication remained unchanged during testing, and was
converted to a LED using a standard approach (Tomlinson et al, 2010). The two patient groups
did not significantly differ in the LED they received (p=.572). Before scanning, each of the
participants underwent a general interview and clinical assessment using the Positive and
Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al, 1987), and the Global Assessment of Functioning
(GAF) (Hall, 1995). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al, 1996) was used to assess
depressive symptoms during the last two weeks and IQ was estimated using the Culture Fair
Intelligence Test (Cattell and Cattell, 1973) and cognitive impairment was measured using the
mini-mental state examination (Folstein et al, 1975).
All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and were without any
contraindications for MRI scanning. At the time of the study, none of the participants were
taking antipsychotic medications or had drug or alcohol dependence. The study was approved
by the Cambridgeshire 3 National Health Service research ethics committee. All subjects gave
written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Salience oddball task
We used a visual oddball paradigm (Bunzeck et al, 2007) in order to investigate negative
emotional salience (Figure 1). A detailed description of the paradigm can be found in our
previous work (Knolle et al, 2018): in summary, participants saw a series of greyscale images
of faces and outdoor scenes. 66.6% of these were ‘standard’, neutral images. Then four types
of deviating images were randomly intermixed with these; each type occurred with a
probability of 8.3%. These deviant events were: stimuli that evoked a negative emotional
response (‘emotional oddball’, angry face or image of car crash); neutral stimuli that required
a motor response (‘target oddball’); neutral stimuli that presented a novel image every time
they appeared (‘novel oddball’); and neutral stimuli of the same face or scene that did not
require a motor response or

contained negative/positive emotional valence (‘neutral

oddball’) (Figure 1). All participants completed 3 blocks of 240 trials each (160 standard trials,

and 20 oddball trials each of target, neutral, emotional and novel stimuli), resulting in a total
of 720 trials. The task contained 50% faces and 50% outdoor scenes, to avoid category-specific
habituation and to make stimulus exploration biologically relevant. Participants were
introduced to the target stimulus prior to the experimental session for 4.5s, and they were
required to make a simple button press in response using their left or right index finger to
each of its subsequent appearances during the experiment within the fMRI-scanner.
Participants used their preferred or less affected hand to press the buttons on the button box
for the target picture. No motor responses were associated with any of the other stimulus
types.
During the fMRI-experiment, the pictures were presented for 500ms followed by a white
fixation cross on a grey background (grey value=127) using an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of
2.7s. ISI was jittered with ±300ms (uniformly distributed). All of the stimuli were taken from
Bunzeck and Düzel (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006). The scalp hair and ears of faces were removed
artificially; the outdoor scenes did not include faces. All pictures were grey scaled and
normalised to a mean grey value of 127 (SD 75). The pictures were projected on to the centre
of a screen, and the participants watched them through a mirror mounted on the head coil,
subtending a visual angle of about 8°.
In the current study, we focussed on negative emotional salience, this contrast was the most
robust in terms of generating within and between group brain activations in our previous
study in young adults with first-episode psychosis (Knolle et al, 2018). We contrasted
activation associated with the emotional and neutral oddball. The contrast between these
stimuli allowed us to examine brain responses to the pure stimulus negative emotional
valence (‘emotional’ vs. ‘neutral’) (Figure 1) given that both images appear at the same
frequency. In contrast, the classical oddball effect is sought by looking at the contrast
between neutral oddball and the standard stimuli, which is based on frequency differences.

Additional behavioural testing: probabilistic reasoning
Additionally, some participants completed a ‘jumping to conclusion’ task (Ermakova et al,
2019): 12 of 23 PD patients without psychosis, 5 of 15 patients with psychotic symptoms, and

18 of 19 controls subjects. Due to the incomplete nature of the data we report these data in
a preliminary analysis in the supplementary materials.

Behaviour analysis
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate group differences in responses to
the target stimuli (i.e. button presses) as well as reaction times. All blocks in which
participants missed more than five button presses were excluded. Behavioural data were
analysed using SPSS 21 (IBM Corp.).

Neuroimaging acquisition and analysis protocol
Data were collected using a Siemens Magnetom Trio Tim syngo MR B17 operating at 3 T.
We used a previously described protocol for the acquisition of the functional imaging data
(Knolle et al, 2018). We acquired gradient-echo echo-planar T2*-weighted images depicting
BOLD contrast from 35 non-contiguous oblique axial plane slices of 2mm thickness to
minimise signal drop-out in the ventral regions. No images of the whole brain were retrieved;
the superior part of the cortex was not imaged. We used the following setup: relaxation time:
1620m; echo time: 30ms; flip angle: 65°; in-plane resolution: 3×3×3mm; matrix size: 64×64;
field of view: 192×192mm; and bandwidth: 2442Hz/px. We acquired a total of 437 volumes
per participant (35 slices each of 2mm thickness, inter-slice gap 1mm). The first five volumes
were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects.
We used FSL software (FMRIB’s Software Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) version five to
analyse the functional data. Participants’ data (first-level analysis) were processed using the
FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT). Functional images were realigned, motion corrected
(MCFLIRT(Jenkinson et al, 2002)) and spatially smoothed with a 8mm full-width halfmaximum Gaussian kernel. A high-pass filter was applied (120s cut-off). All images were
registered to the whole-brain echo-planar image (EPI) (i.e., functional image with the wholebrain field of view), and then to the structural image of the corresponding participant
(MPRAGE) and normalised to an MNI template, using linear registration with FSL FLIRT.

The five explanatory variables (EVs) that we used were the onset times of the standard, target,
emotional, novel and neutral pictures. They were modelled as 1s events and convolved with
a canonical double-gamma response function. We added a temporal derivative to the model
to take into account possible variations in the haemodynamic response function. To capture
residual movement-related artefacts, six covariates were used as regressors of no interest
(three rigid-body translations and three rotations resulting from realignment). We used four
contrasts: target-neutral, emotion-neutral, novel-neutral, and neutral-standard. However, in
this study we only investigated the contrast of emotional-neutral. In the “second-level”
analysis, we averaged the 3 blocks of the task for each participant using FEAT with Fixed
Effects.
Region of interest analysis for all voxels within one cluster
For our main analysis, we pursued a region of interest (ROI) approach: For our salience type
of interest – negative emotional salience – our primary hypothesis involved four regions that
had been found to be most active in a former study using the same paradigm (Knolle et al,
2018). These four regions included the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental
area/substantia nigra), the ventral and dorsal striatum, the bilateral hippocampus and the
bilateral amygdala. The mask for the dopaminergic midbrain region was generated using the
probabilistic atlas of Murty and colleagues (Murty et al, 2014) and has been used successfully
in our own previous work (Ermakova et al, 2018; Knolle et al, 2018). Masks for all other
regions were anatomically derived using the Harvard-Oxford subcortical structural atlas
supplied with FSL. For planned group comparisons, we extracted contrast values (contrast of
parameter estimates, or COPEs in FSL) for each individual from all the voxels within each of
the four ROIs. We furthermore used the Featquery application in FSL to extract parameter
estimates for individual event types within regions of interest for analysis presented in the
supplementary materials. Average COPE values per region of interest were entered into a
multivariate analysis of variance to compare groups.
Voxelwise permutation analysis
For analysis at the voxel-based resolution, all four ROIs were combined in one mask. For
estimation of group comparison (higher level, or “third level”) statistics, we used permutation
testing utilising the FSL randomise tool within our ROIs mask and the whole brain, with

threshold-free-cluster enhancement, which enhances cluster-like structures but remains
fundamentally a voxel-wise statistical testing method (Winkler et al, 2014). We used 5000
permutations and report significant results at p=0.05 or less following family-wise error
correction for multiple comparisons, using the variance smoothing option (3mm) as
recommended for experiments with small to modest sample sizes, as is common in fMRI
research (Nichols and Holmes, 2002). We applied this method to our combined ROI and the
whole brain. We used fslmeants to extract means from voxels revealing a significant group;
we then used the extracted values purely for visualization of the group effect.
Resting cerebral blood flow
Interpretation of BOLD activation effects is complicated by difficulties in assessing whether
any results are truly due to differences in evoked activation, or to baseline resting cerebral
blood flow (CBF) (perfusion) differences “at rest” (Fleisher et al, 2009; Simon and Buxton,
2015). CBF could be altered by disease course or medication, as dopaminergic drugs act
directly on the blood vessels and lead to vasodilation which increases CBF (Leenders et al,
1985). We therefore assessed resting CBF at baseline for all participants except for one PD
patient without psychotic symptoms. For this assessment, we used a continuous arterial spin
labelling (cASL) protocol described in Wang and colleagues (Wang et al, 2005) and adopted
in other studies (Viviani et al, 2009). We used the following setup: relaxation time: 4000ms;
echo time: 17ms; sequence: gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with anterior-toposterior phase encoding; multi-slice mode: interleaved; number of images: 120 with and
without labelling; flip angle: 90°; in-plane resolution: 3.8×3.8×6mm; slice thickness: 6mm;
matrix size: 64×64; field of view: 249×249mm; and bandwidth: 2442Hz/px. We inserted a 1s
delay between labelling pulse and image acquisition. We used the SPM2 package (Wellcome
Department of Cognitive Neurology, London; online at http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk) for
realignment and stereotactic normalization to an EPI template (Montreal Neurological
Institute, resampling size: 2 × 2 × 2 mm). Using the Perf_resconstruct_V02 SPM add-on
software by Rao and Wang (Department of Radiology and Center for Functional
Neuroimaging at

University

of

Pennsylvania;

online

at http://www.cfn.upenn.edu/perfusion/software.htm), we reconstructed resting CBF
values. We then used a ‘simple subtraction’ method (Wang et al, 2003). All volumes were
smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel of full width half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm

prior to the analysis. We used the SPM PET basic models setup to generate our group
statistics and then a one-way ANOVA with an explicit mask and an ANOVA normalisation. We
also used the Marsbar toolbox to extract mean CBF for our regions of interest and then
employed those values as covariates in our planned group comparisons for the task
activations. Statistical analyses were generated using SPSS 21 (IBM Corp.).

Movement differences during fMRI scan
The task was split into 3 blocks of 11.5min. Blocks in which movement exceeded 3mm on
average or 10mm maximum were excluded from the analysis. We only included participants
with at least two blocks. We identified two PD patients without psychotic symptoms that had
movement exclusion criterion in two out of three blocks and so they were excluded from all
the analyses.
We compared the maximum and mean movement across the three blocks in two separate
repeated measure ANOVAs (Table 2). We did not find any significant group, block or
interactions effect, neither for mean movement nor for maximum movement (all p>0.1).

Results
Behavioural results
Throughout the task, participants were asked to press a button in response to two target
pictures - one for face stimuli and one for the scene stimuli. This ensured that participants
maintained their attention throughout the task. In two separate repeated measure ANOVAs,
we analysed the number of button presses and the reaction times in response to both target
pictures together (Supplementary Figure 1 and 2, respectively). We found a significant effect
for the number of misses across blocks (F(2)=3.82 p=.025, 68.3%power), but no group effect
or interaction. Bonferroni corrected post hoc-tests revealed that participants missed
marginally more button presses in the third compared to the second block (p=.059). On
average, participants failed to press the button on 6 target trials per block (mean run1=5.78
(SD=2.4); mean run2=5.45 (SD=2.4); mean run3=6.4 (SD=3.1)). Furthermore, we found a
significant effect for reaction time across blocks (F(2)=6.31 p=.003, 88.9%power), but no

group effect or interaction. Bonferroni corrected post hoc-tests revealed that participants
reacted significantly faster to target images in block 1 compared to block 2 (p=.014) and block
3 (p=.019). On average, participants required between 500 and 600 ms (mean run1=.531
(SD=.1); mean run2=.555 (SD=.1); mean run3=.560 (SD=.1)) to make a response, which is
consistent with previous findings (Knolle et al, 2018).

Imaging results

Group analysis of resting cerebral blood flow
The one-way ANOVA on resting CBF data did not reveal any significant group differences.

fMRI activation to emotional salience
In our main analysis, we investigated potential group differences in emotional salience related
activation, while controlling for resting CBF. We extracted the mean BOLD activation (COPE,
contrast of parameter estimates between neutral and emotional oddballs) as well as the
mean resting CBF from each individual region used in the ROI cluster. We conducted a
multivariate analysis of variance to determine whether there were any statistically significant
differences between the Parkinson’s patients with psychotic symptoms, Parkinson’s patients
without psychotic symptoms and healthy controls on the BOLD activation per region
controlling for CBF in the corresponding region (Figure 2).
The multivariate test revealed a significant group effect on brain activation in response to
negative emotional salience within the ROIs, controlling for resting CBF in ROIs respectively,

supplementary materials) are very similar and this supports the conclusion that they are not
driven by differences in the CBF.
In the amygdala, we found bilaterally significantly greater (p=.004) activation in PD patients
with psychotic symptoms (mean: 28.51, SE 9.8) compared to those without (mean: -8.82, SE
7.6). Controls (mean: 4.95, SE 9.2) did not significantly differ from either patient group.
In the hippocampus bilaterally we found significantly greater (p=.028) activation in PD
patients with psychotic symptoms (mean: 14.84, SE 9.0) compared to those without (mean: 10.85, SE 7.1). Controls (mean: 11.41, SE 8.5) had marginally significantly greater activity
compared to PD patients without psychotic symptoms but this did not significantly differ from
PD patients with psychotic symptoms.
In the striatum we found significantly greater (p=.017) activation in PD patients with psychotic
symptoms (mean: 32.33, SE 14.7) compared to those without (mean: -13.37, SE 11.5).
Controls (mean: 12.4, SE 13.9) did not significantly differ from either patient group.

Exploratory correlations of symptom scores, brain responses and medication
We conducted exploratory Pearson correlations between medication, symptom scores and
brain activations.
Importantly, in PD patients with psychotic symptoms, we found a positive correlation
between LED and the BOLD activation in the ROIs (bilateral amygdala: r=.696, p=.017, bilateral
hippocampus: r=.624, p=.040, substantia nigra: r=.678, p=.022, striatum: r=.721, p=.012).
Furthermore, LED was positively correlated to BDI score (r=.641, p=.034) and LED and apathy
score (AES, r=.891, p=.007). There was also an additional negative correlation between LED
and the GAF disability score (r=-.603, p=.050). In the same patients, we found, however, that
the BDI score was positively correlated to resting CBF bilaterally in the hippocampus (r=.631,
p=.015), the amygdala (marginally significant: r=.515, p=.059) as well as the substantia nigra
(r=.646, p=.013). We did not find any such correlations in either of the other groups.
Pearson correlation analysis within each group did not reveal any significant interactions
between BOLD activation and resting CBF. Furthermore, we did not find any significant
correlations between symptom scores (GAF disability and BDI scores) and brain responses to

negative emotional stimuli, except for one. In patients without psychotic symptoms, we found
that the BDI score was positively correlated to resting CBF in the substantia nigra (r=.450,
p=.036).

We used the Fisher r-to-z transformation to test whether the correlations in PD patients with
psychotic symptoms were significantly different from the correlations in the other groups (see

Supplementary Table 1). We found that the correlations of LED and BOLD activation as well

as symptom scores were significantly different between the two patient group. Correlations

between BDI and resting CBF in patients with psychotic symptoms differed significantly from

those in controls, but not from the other patient group.

Voxelwise permutation analysis on negative emotional salience BOLD activation
In our ROI, we found two clusters within the striatum, the left putamen and left pallidum, in
which groups significantly differed (Table 3, Figure 3 A, B).
Furthermore, a whole brain analysis revealed significant differences in the parietal
operculum, the supramarginal gyrus, planum temporale and pre- and postcentral gyrus (Table
3, Figure 3 A, C).
We extracted parameter estimates from the significant clusters to visualise the group
differences (Figure 3 B and C).
Additionally, we extracted the parameter estimates separately in response to emotional and
neutral oddballs, as the conditions which define the contrast of interest. These are presented
in the supplementary materials (Supplementary Figure 3) for all regions within the ROI. The
parameter estimates indicate the potential drivers of the COPE (contrast of parameter
estimates) effect.

Discussion
In the current study we investigated negative emotional salience in PD patients with and
without psychotic symptoms and compared them to healthy controls. Based on previous
studies and the literature (Ermakova et al, 2018; Garofalo et al, 2017; Knolle et al, 2018), we

hypothesised there would be altered brain activity in the striatum, substantia nigra,
hippocampus and amygdala in both patients’ groups compared to control subjects, with an
intermediate alteration in PD patients without psychotic symptoms. In line with our
hypothesis, we found significant differences between both patient groups. PD patients with
psychotic symptoms revealed strongly enhanced brain responses in the striatum, the
hippocampus and the amygdala compared to PD patients without psychotic symptoms. PD
patients with psychotic symptoms showed enhanced responses compared to controls but the
difference did not reach significance. PD patients without psychotic symptoms only differed
from controls in the striatum.
Our study is the first to investigate emotional salience processing in PD patients with and
without psychotic symptoms. Our findings suggest that salience processing differentiates the
two patient groups, and that overactivation within the hippocampal-striatal-midbrain circuits
might contribute to the occurrence of psychotic symptoms in PD patients. Importantly, our
study controls for putative dopaminergic medication effects on the baseline BOLD signal
strength by assessing the resting cerebral blood flow (resting CBF) in all groups.
The current study reveals that PD patients with psychotic symptoms show a strongly
enhanced response to salience in the striatum, amygdala and hippocampus compared to PD
patients without psychotic symptoms. The pattern of activation in the PD patients with
psychotic symptoms is reversed to that which has been reported in patients with primary
psychosis (Knolle et al, 2018). Interestingly, however, in that work we also found that the
stronger the psychotic symptoms the stronger the activation in response to emotional
salience which is in line with the results in the PD patients with psychotic symptoms.
Correspondingly, an exploratory analysis revealed that in PD patients with psychotic
symptoms, the dose of dopaminergic medication as measured by LED, positively correlated
with the BOLD activation in all ROIs (i.e., bilateral amygdala, bilateral hippocampus, substantia
nigra). In addition, the dopaminergic medication dose was positively linked to measured
depression (BDI) and apathy (AES), as well as negatively linked to global functioning (GAF
disability). In patients without psychotic symptoms, we did not find any significant
correlations between brain activation and psychopathology or medication, controls also not
showing any correlations between brain activation and psychopathology. There was no
significant difference in the overall medication dose between both patient groups. We

therefore suggest a potential imbalance in the interaction between medication dependent
tonic dopamine levels and phasic dopamine responses to sensory input in PD patients with
psychotic symptoms. Our study indicates a link between the use of medication, processing
alterations of salient stimuli as well as symptom scores. This is consistent with a study showing
that the administration of a dopamine agonist (pramipexole or ropinirole) in young
medication-naïve PD patients led to an increase in aberrant motivational salience by
facilitating arbitrary and illusory associations between stimuli and rewards, and by faster
reaction times to task-irrelevant stimuli as well as a slight increase in psychotic like symptoms
(Nagy et al, 2012). Furthermore, in PD patients with psychotic symptoms only, we found
positive correlations between the resting CBF within the four ROIs and depression severity,
linking higher depression severity with higher resting CBF. When comparing the correlations
across groups, PD patients with psychotic symptoms were only significantly different from the
correlations in healthy controls. As the correlations were stronger in patients with, compared
to without, psychotic symptoms, the results provide some additional indication for the
mechanistic link between risk factors like depression and PD psychosis. Bold signal strength
has been reported to depend on CBF levels (Simon and Buxton, 2015) but importantly we did
not find that there were any significant differences in these parameters between groups.
Therefore, it is unlikely that this correlation could fully explain the opposing signal between
the two patient groups.
Our results are consistent with prior evidence that the use of dopaminergic medication is
linked to the development of psychotic symptoms in PD patients (Zahodne and Fernandez,
2008). However, we still lack a full mechanistic explanation of why the use of dopaminergic
drugs lead to psychotic symptoms in some patients but not in others. The aberrant salience
hypothesis of psychosis suggests, first, that a dysregulated dopaminergic system in the
mesolimbic system leads to the attribution of salience to otherwise irrelevant signals (Kapur,
2003); and, second, that these irrelevant signals are taken as valid information, and integrated
by seemingly plausible top-down explanations, which supports the development of delusions
and hallucinations.
With regard to the first prerequisite, PD patients show a clear dopaminergic pathology, which
may involve dysregulation in some patients. Deficits in critical reasoning and accepting hasty
cognitive explanations have often been reported in psychosis, mainly in schizophrenia but

also other psychotic disorders (Garety et al, 2005; Lincoln et al, 2010). ‘Jumping to
conclusions’ reflects a bias in critical reasoning where individuals draw a conclusion based on
too little information for making an informed decision. In psychosis, ‘jumping to conclusions’
is considered a trait contributing to developing delusions (Garety and Freeman, 2013), as
individuals who jump to conclusions might be prone to accepting implausible ideas and
disregard alternative explanations. Djamshidan and colleagues were able to detect a bias in
generating and accepting abnormal explanations for aberrantly salient stimuli in medicated
(Djamshidian et al, 2012) and unmedicated (de Rezende Costa et al, 2016) PD patients. We
speculate that this could relate to a cortical pathology, which is now well recognised in
Parkinson’s disease (Kövari et al, 2003; Mattila et al, 2000). In our current study, we report
some exploratory ‘jumping to conclusions’ results on our cohort of patients and controls in
the supplementary materials given that only some of the patients/controls completed this
part of our study. The results indicated that PD patients with psychotic symptoms showed a
‘jumping to conclusion’ bias by sampling less information before making a decision, which
therefore also had a lower probability of being correct. This bias was not present in PD
patients without psychotic symptoms or controls. We therefore suggest that the
development of psychotic symptoms in PD patients may result from a combination of
aberrantly enhanced salience signals in the striatal-hippocampal-midbrain circuits and
deficient cognitive reasoning (possibly cortical) processes.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence for the first time that aberrant striatal,
hippocampal and amygdala signalling during processing of non-motivational salient stimuli
differentiates PD patients with and without psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, the results
indicated impaired top-down processing in PD patients with psychotic symptoms. Taken
together, the results suggest that enhanced signalling in these regions and deficient top-down
cognitive regulations, possibly lead to the development of psychotic symptoms, in a similar
way as that proposed in the ‘aberrant salience hypothesis’ of psychosis.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Task design. During this visual oddball paradigm, participants are presented with a
random series of greyscale images of faces and outdoor scenes. 66.6% of these were
‘standard’ images. The remaining 33.4% consisted of four types of rare or contextually
deviant events, which were randomly intermixed with the standard stimuli; each occurred
with a probability of 8.3%. These deviant events were: neutral stimuli that required a motor
response (‘target oddball’); stimuli that evoked a negative emotional response (‘emotional
oddball’, angry face or image of car crash); novel stimuli (‘novel oddball’, different neutral
images that appear only once); and neutral stimuli (‘neutral oddball’, neutral image of face
or scene). In the current study, we were only interested in the contrast between negative
emotional and neutral oddball stimuli (image from (Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006)).
