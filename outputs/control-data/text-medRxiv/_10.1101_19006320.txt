Abstract:
Background: Fibromyalgia is characterised by chronic widespread pain. Quality of
life is further reduced by autonomic and cognitive symptoms, including subjective
‘brain-fog’ and dissociative experiences. Although an association with joint
hypermobility suggests variant connective tissue is a factor in both fibromyalgia and
dysautonomia, the mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric symptoms are
poorly understood.
Methods: 21 fibromyalgia patients and 21 healthy controls were assessed for joint
hypermobility dissociative experiences, autonomic symptoms and interoceptive
sensibility. Mediation analyses were conducted according to the method of Baron
and Kenny.
Results: Patients with fibromyalgia reported greater dissociative experiences and
autonomic symptoms. The relationship between fibromyalgia and dissociative
experiences

was

fully

mediated

by

symptoms

of

orthostatic

intolerance.

Fibromyalgia, dissociative experiences and orthostatic intolerance all were
associated with joint hypermobility and interoceptive sensibility.
Conclusions: This exploratory investigation highlights the relationship between
dissociative experiences in the context of fibromyalgia and subjective experience of
aberrant physiological responses. These findings can enhance the recognition and
management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia, wherein
dissociative experiences reflect disturbance of self-representation that can arise
through abnormalities in internal agency, autonomic (dys)control and interoceptive
prediction errors.

INTRODUCTION

Fibromyalgia is characterised by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain lasting for
more than 3 months 1 and has a prevalence in the UK population of approximately 25% 2. Patients with fibromyalgia score significantly lower in health-related quality of
life domains than either those in the general population or patients with other
musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis 3.
Symptom domains that are associated with lower quality of life alongside pain
include neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional fatigue, subjective and
objective cognitive dysfunction (i.e. brain-fog) and dissociative experiences 4. These
have recognised phenomenological overlap. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of
brain-fog and dissociative experiences is associated with higher pain intensity and
decreased mental well-being 4. Although patients frequently report these extramusculoskeletal

manifestations of fibromyalgia, the mechanisms underlying

neuropsychiatric symptoms are poorly understood.
Many patients with fibromyalgia also experience symptoms of autonomic dysfunction
(dysautonomia), particularly in association with orthostatic intolerance, which may
reach criteria for Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS)

5

. Fibromyalgia and

dysautonomia are additionally both associated with connective tissue conditions
specifically joint hypermobility

6 7

. Joint hypermobility can be classified into

generalised joint hypermobility (GJH) or and symptomatic joint hypermobility
(Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, formerly known as Joint Hypermobility
Syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos

syndrome

hypermobility

type)

in

which

GJH

is

accompanied with significant musculoskeletal or connective tissue symptoms. The
Brighton Criteria are currently the only validated research criteria for diagnosis of
symptomatic joint hypermobility 8.
This study aimed to investigate a possible mechanism for the basis of dissociative
experiences in fibromyalgia, based on emerging theory linking the consciousness
experience of integrity of self-integrity to the predictive control of internal bodily state
9

.

METHODS
Participants
We recruited 22 patients with fibromyalgia from a Rheumatology Clinic in Sussex.
Fibromyalgia was defined using modified 2010 The American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) criteria 1. These participants were compared to 22 heathy
controls recruited via advert free of major psychiatric or neurological disorder.

Data collection
After collection of demographic and medical information, each participant underwent
formal clinical assessment of joint hypermobility by a trained medical professional.
Each participant then completed questionnaires examining dissociative and
autonomic symptoms.

In addition they completed self-report measure of

interoceptive sensibility.
The Dissociative Experiences Scale-II (DES-II)

10

is the most commonly used tool to

measure dissociative experiences and consists of 28 experience items respondents
mark on a 11-point Likert scale.
An autonomic and quality of life self-administered questionnaire (AQQoL)

11

was

used to quantify self-reported symptoms indicative of autonomic dysfunction across
different domains, including orthostatic, gastrointestinal, bladder, secretomotor,
sudomotor and sleep. Here we focus on orthostatic intolerance symptom severity
(rather than impact on quality of life) as variable of interest because of the
established link between fibromyalgia and orthostatic intolerance..
Interoceptive sensibility

12

was measured using the awareness subsection of the

Porges Body Perception Questionnaire13.

Participants were assessed for presence of symptomatic joint hypermobility using
the Brighton Criteria which incorporate the Beighton Scale 8.
Informed consent was received from all participants. The study was approved by the
NRES Ethics Committee (South East Coast) (12.LO.1942)

Statistical analysis
Anonymised datasets were analysed in SPSS (Version 25, SPSS Inc.).
Between-group differences in dissociative experience scores and symptoms of
autonomic dysfunction were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test as they were
normally distributed. Between group differences in interoceptive sensibility scores
were assessed using independent samples T test as these data were normally
distributed. A statistical significance threshold of p <0.05 was used.
Analysis of whether orthostatic intolerance mediated the relationship between
fibromyalgia and dissociative experiences was conducted according to the method of
Baron and Kenny

14

and was adjusted for gender.

Correlation analyses were

conducted using linear regression.
This method necessitates that an independent predictor variable (fibromyalgia) is
significantly and independently related to the mediator variable (orthostatic
intolerance) and dependent variable (dissociative experiences). Full mediation is
suggested if the relationship between the independent variable and dependent
variable is rendered non-significant by addition of a mediator.

RESULTS
Characteristics of study population
After exclusion of 1 healthy control and 1 participant with fibromyalgia due to
incomplete data, the study population included 21 patients with fibromyalgia (20
female; mean age 41.86 years) and 21 heathy controls (15 female; mean age 43.48
years). There were no significant differences in age between the two groups.

Dissociative experiences
Patients with fibromyalgia reported significantly greater (mean, SEM) dissociative
symptoms (48.67, 10.00) compared to controls (18.14, 2.72), (U= 134.0, p= 0.029).

Autonomic dysfunction symptoms
Total autonomic symptom severity across all domains (mean, SEM) was higher in
patients with fibromyalgia (83.48, 9.62) than controls (19.29, 2.49), (U=23.0,
p=<0.001) and was significantly higher in each individual autonomic domain.
Symptom severity in all atuonomic domains except bladder was significantly
correlated with increase in dissociative symptoms. Orthostatic intolerance symptom
severity explained 94% of the variance of total autonomic symptom severity.

Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance
Patients with fibromyalgia reported significantly greater (mean, SEM) symptoms of
orthostatic intolerance (41.90, 4.93) compared to controls (8.48, 1.06) (U=14.5,
p<0.001)

Analysis

of

relationship

between

fibromyalgia,

dissociative

experiences and orthostatic intolerance
It was shown that there was a significant correlation between fibromyalgia
(independent variable) and dissociative experiences (dependent variable), which
remained after adjusting for gender (β =0.406, p=0.011).
Correlation analysis, adjusting for gender suggested there was a significant
relationship between fibromyalgia and orthostatic intolerance (β=0.693, p=<0.001)
and between orthostatic intolerance and dissociative experiences (β=0.412,
p=0.010).
Additionally, adjusting for symptoms of orthostatic intolerance rendered this
relationship non-significant (β=0.231, p=0.281), suggesting full mediation (Figure 1).

Correlation with symptomatic joint hypermobility
All

three variables

(Fibromyalgia,

dissociative experiences and

orthostatic

intolerance) correlated significantly with the presence of symptomatic joint
hypermobility as defined by Brighton Criteria. Only 3 participants with Fibromyalgia
did not meet Brighton Criteria, whereas only 6 controls met Brighton Criteria – this
was significant (X2 14.00, 1, p=<0.001).

Patients meeting Brighton Critereria

reported significantly greater (mean, SEM) dissociative symptoms (45.00, 3.15)
compared to controls (17.94, 3.15), (U= 137.0, p=0.045). Patients meeting Brighton
Criteria reported significantly greater (mean, SEM) orthostatic intolerance symptoms
(36.04, 5.17) compared to controls (10.72, 1.82), (U=77.5, p<0.001).

Relationship to interoceptive sensibility

DISCUSSION
This is the first study, to the authors’ knowledge, that explores dissociative
experiences in the context of fibromyalgia in relation to autonomic symptoms. The
results are significant suggesting, for a patient population vulnerable to
neuropsychiatric symptoms, dissociative experiences are mediated by symptoms of
orthostatic intolerance.
The results reinforce existing evidence for the known associations between
fibromyalgia and dysautonomia
experiences

5

and between fibromyalgia and dissociative

4

. Importantly, this is the first account to explicitly link all three

phenomena.
Previous work has suggested that hypermobility, a common connective tissue
condition, has a multisystem phenotype and its presence is a vulnerability factor for a
variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms

15

. Our study suggests that abnormalities of

connective tissue found in joint hypermobility disorders and linked to fibromyalgia
may also fundamentally underlie the expression of autonomic dysfunction and, in
turn, predispose to dissociative experiences.
These results offer fresh avenues to enhance the formal recognition and treatment of
cognitive symptoms including dissociative experiences and brain-fog, which can be
debilitating and significantly lower quality of life 4. Therapeutic methods to alter both
autonomic function itself and how autonomic changes are subjectively experienced
may be useful approaches to the management of these cognitive symptoms.
Nevertheless, this small study indicates a need for more research to develop and
fully characterise these results. In addition to larger sample sizes, further studies
would usefully combine objective autonomic testing, a more representative gender
mix, updated definitions of hypermobility syndromes, and a broader set of measures
to differentiate dissociative experiences.
Significantly, our results are also in line with theoretical advances in consciousness
science that hypothesise a basis to dissociative experiences in abnormalities of self
representation arising through aberrant internal agency 9. This model is based on
Bayesian neural computations and the signalling of interoceptive prediction error,

which may be revealed by subjective symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Of note
patient participants had enhanced interoceptive sensibility.
In conclusion, this exploratory study of fibromyalgia points to a mechanism behind
commonly reported neuropsychiatric symptoms; our results indicate that subjective
symptoms of orthostatic intolerance mediates the relationship between fibromyalgia
and dissociative experiences.
