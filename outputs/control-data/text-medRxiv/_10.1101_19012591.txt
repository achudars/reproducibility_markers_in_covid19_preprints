Title of the article: Shifting of economic responsibilities on vulnerable shoulders for
survival of families: a scenario from mining industry in India
Abstract
Context: Mining industry has boomed precipitously to provide for demand of metal and
minerals for emerging infrastructure. It is major occupation in India involving large work
force, although it is hazardous. Aims: To assess the socio-demographic profile of sandstone
mine workers in Jodhpur and to identify their major social issues.
Material and Methods: Study design: Cross-sectional study; Setting: Residential area of mine
workers, Jodhpur, Rajasthan; Participants: Mine workers residing in residential areas in
Jodhpur district for more than 6 months, and who gave consent for participation in study.
Data on socioeconomic status and occupation of each family members was collected;
Analysis: Data was analysed using SPSS v.23. P value <0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
Results: One thousand six hundred four mine workers were enrolled in study. More than
three fourth (78.7%) of them were male. Their age ranged between 14 to 82 years with mean
age of 37.62 ± 12.30 years. Mean age of female workers was significantly higher than of
male workers. Average years of working for males was significantly higher than females.
Mean age of entry into mines for male workers (20.33 ± 6.69) was significantly lower than
females (24.59 ± 8.52). About 2.68% children below 14 years of age were involved in any
sort of income generation activity. Conclusions: Majority of mine workers were of young age
group. Major socioeconomic issues found were illiteracy, child marriage, child labour,
loneliness and shifting economic responsibilities on females.
Strengths and limitations: Robust dataset, complete enumeration, large sample size.
Key-words: Silicosis, Occupational health, Economic burden, Mining, Females

Key messages
What is already known about this subject? The miners work under exploitative conditions
and their families live in severe poverty with no access to health services. Families living
close to the mines and are prone to developing silicosis from secondary exposure, they are
also prone for malnourishment, tuberculosis and other comorbid conditions. Early deaths of
the male earning member lead to vulnerable members of family to take the job for their
livelihood. There are many reported widow villages where there is no male member due to
death of the same by pneumoconiosis.
What is the new findings? There is increasing burden on the shoulders of the vulnerable
groups (children, females and elderly) among families of sandstone miners in India.
Illiteracy, child marriage, child labour and loneliness are among major social problems in
these families.
How might this impact on policy in the foreseeable future? Families where the main bread
earner died of pneumoconiosis could be provided pension to supplement for their food and
health expenses requirement. Rajasthan state in India has recently launched “Silicosis
Policy”, and this study signifies the importance of implementing such polices in other states
in India.

Introduction:
Importance of mining has increased precipitously to provide for the demand of metal and
minerals for the emerging infrastructure.1 Although mining is a hazardous occupation, yet it
is one of the major occupations in India involving large number of work force which is going
to grow in future. 2,3
Approximately 90% sandstone in India is acquired from the land of the state of Rajasthan
which is largest state of India. This is used in India as well as exported to Canada, Japan, and
countries in the Middle East.4 There are near about 30,000 mines in Rajasthan, in which
more than 2.5 million people are employed. Out of those mines around 1300 are sandstone
mines, in which more than 71,000 miners are working.4 Those workers are involved in
various activities in mines like; drilling, blasting, crushing the large stone to smaller one and
loading-unloading of slab from trucks, that expose them to high levels of silica dust for
prolonged periods of time.1 The geological configuration of Jodhpur district of Rajasthan is
interesting and is represented by rocks like; sandstone, limestone, granite, rhyolite, schist,
phyllite, and slate.5 It shares a common border with five districts: Bikaner and Jaisalmer in
the north and north-west, respectively; Banner and Pali in the south-west and south-east,
respectively; and Nagaur in the northeast. Jodhpur is the zonal headquarter to controls all
mineral- related activities in western part of Rajasthan.
Although there are studies carried out on mine workers in Jodhpur but they are focused on
disease aspects (silicosis).6-8 It has been proved that mine workers, especially males are
usually exposed to silica since childhood, and die due to silicosis at quite early age.9 After
their death somebody from their dependent family members, who in most of the cases are
either their widows or young children, is bound to work in mines for their survival. And this
cycle is continuing over generations. There is deficiency of robust datasets to prove these

facts, henceforth this study was carried out with the aim to assess the socio-demographic
profile of sandstone mine workers in Jodhpur and to identify their major social issues.
Material and Methods:
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study which was conducted for one year (April 2018 to
March 2019) in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan state. Study was carried out in residential area
of mine workers. Mine owners of all the selected mines were contacted and explained about
the purpose of the study. All the mine workers who were present at the time of survey were
included in the study. After establishing the rapport with mine owners they were informed
about the study, its objective and the questions we were going to ask. Informed consent was
taken. Participants who gave consent for the study were asked questions on socioeconomic
status and occupation of each family members. The study was approved by Institutes Ethical
Committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur. Data was analysed
using SPSS v.23, appropriate tables and graphs were prepared and inferences were drawn
using chi-square and t-test. P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Patient and Public involvement: Just after the conception of idea of this study the
investigator talked to the resident mine workers regarding the study and how it will be
conducted, the information that will be asked and the benefit of the study. Mine workers were
not involved in the design of study/ framing of the research question/ conduct of the study.
The study findings were discussed with the mine-workers verbally and appropriate advise
was given.
Results
Table 1 depicts that a total of 1604 mine workers were enrolled in the study. More than three
fourth (78.7%) of them were male. Their age ranged between 14 to 82 years with mean age of

37.62 ± 12.30 years. The data was normally distributed according to age of the mine workers
(Figure 1). Most of the workers (78%) were in the age group of 20- 49 years. Thirty-nine
workers were below 20 years of age and 7.1% workers were elderly. Mean age of female
workers was significantly higher than the mean age of male workers. Majority (93.7%) of
them were married. The proportion of widows was significantly higher among female
workers, while proportion of unmarried was significantly higher among males. It was
affirmed that 13.22% mine workers got married below the legal age of marriage (21 for male
and 18 for female). This proportion was significantly higher for females. More than half of
the mine workers were illiterate (53.4%), and this status of illiteracy was significantly higher
among females.
It is evident from table 2 that about two third (62.6%) of the workers were working for more
than 10 years in mines. The mean period of work was 16.71 ± 9.72 years and ranged between
1 year to 60 years. Average years of working for males was significantly higher than females.
The mean age of entry into mines for male workers (20.33 ± 6.69) was significantly lower
than female workers (24.59 ± 8.52). Workers started working in mines from 9 years of age to
62 years of age.
Table 3 depicts that 110 (6.9%) mine workers were living alone. As much as 124 (7.7%)
workers were having only one family member in their house. It is evident from figure 2 and 3
that, the other family member for majority (82.1%) of the male workers was their wife
followed by parents (8.4%), brother (4.2%), son/grandson (3.1%) and daughter (2.1%). While
for most of the female miners (45%) the other family member was son/grandson followed by
husband (38%), daughter (14%) and mother in law (3%). Average family size of the mine
workers was 4.45 ± 1.57 which was ranging from 1 to 11. This average family size was
significantly large for male workers (4.87±1.93) as compared to female workers (4.23±1.98).

Almost 40% of the mine workers were having at least one more family member as mine
worker.
Table 4 illustrates the age and sex distribution of family members of mine workers.
Table 5 depicts that 2.68% children below 14 year of age were involved in any sort of income
generation activity. This child labour was significantly more prevalent among male children.
The youngest child who was labour was of 6 years old. Youngest mine workers were two,
and both were 7 years old. Besides that, 6.5% children between age 14 to 18 year of age were
mine workers, which is a hazardous occupation.
Discussion:
After extensive literature search, it was observed that there is lack of epidemiological studies
which describes the socio-demographic profiling of sandstone mine workers in India and
highlight their social issues. This study was conducted to fulfil this knowledge gap.
Demographic and occupational profiling of mine workers
In this study, about three fourth of the mine workers were males. Similar pattern of gender
distribution of mine workers has been reported by Shamim M. et.al. (2017) in Rajasthan and
Tiwari RR (2010) in Gujarat.10,11 Different gender distribution (55.1% males and 44.9%
females) has been observed by Tiwari RR (2005) among quartz stone workers.12
In the present study, about two third (62.6%) of the workers were working in mines for more
than 10 years. Nandi S et.al. (2018) has also reported similar level of work experience among
mine workers.3 Contrary to this Rajashekar S et al. (2017) has reported that majority of the
mine workers in Karnataka had total work experience of five years.13 The mean years of
working in the present study was 16.71 ± 9.72 years which is lower than the mean years of
work reported by Ahmad A (2015)14 and Shamim M et al. (2017).11 Mine workers were

involved in various activities in the mines from drilling, blasting, cutting of stones to carrying
the stones, loading the stones in the vehicles, cleaning of the waste material.

Social issues of mine workers
In this study, following major social issues were identified among mine workers and their
family members.
1. Illiteracy
More than half of the mine workers were illiterate in the present study. Higher level of
illiteracy among mine workers in North India has also been reported by other studies.10,14,15
Mine workers of Southern part of India had relatively better educational status.13 The
proportion of illiteracy was significantly higher among the female workers compared to the
male workers. Study also highlights that among family members of mine workers, more than
half of the children between 14 to 18 year age group were dropped out from the schools. This
proportion of dropouts was significantly more for girls, which is opposite to the findings
reported by Government of India.16
2. Child marriage
India has maintained laws against child marriage since 1929, but still child marriage is quite
prevalent in certain areas of the country.17,18 Prevalent and deep routed social norms pushes
children and especially girls for early marriage and discourages education.19 It was observed
that 13.22% mine workers got married below the legal age of marriage (21 for male and 18
for female) in the present study, and this proportion was significantly higher among the
female workers. Girls are bounded by social norms which force them for early marriage and

discourage education.19 This figure is quite lower than the proportion reported by National
Family Heath Survey 4th round (NFHS IV) for both males and females for rural Rajasthan.20
3. Loneliness
Loneliness is considered as a disease. It may lead to a decline of well-being, depression,
suicidal behaviour, sleep problems, disturbed appetite etc.21 A strong need of the specific
public support systems and health care strategies to take care of these people has already been
emphasised.22,23 Although average family size of the mine workers in this study was 4.45 ±
1.57, which is in accordance with the average family size reported in NFHS IV 24, about 7%
of the mine workers were living alone in their houses. Relatively larger average household
size for mine workers was reported by Ahmad A (2014 &2017).14,25
4. Female mine workers
In the present study, the mean age of the female mine workers (39.16 ± 12.56 years) was
significantly higher than the male workers (37.62 ± 12.30 years). This could be due to late
age of entry into the mining work, as evident by the significantly higher age of entrant in
female workers (24.59 ± 8.52 years) in mines as compared to the male workers (20.33 ± 6.69
years). This higher mean age of entry into mine for females may be due to the reason that
females start working in mines to fulfil their financial needs only after marriage, when their
husband got diseased or died due to silicosis and they have several children to care for.26
This statement can be supported by the fact that the proportion of widows was significantly
higher among female workers (6.4%), compared to male workers (0.2%), and mean years of
working was significantly lower among female workers (14.57 ± 9.09) compared to male
workers (17.29 ± 9.81). Among two-member family of male mine workers, the other member
who was living with them was wife for majority (82.1%), while husbands as other family
member was with only 38% of the female mine workers living in two-member family. This

also supports the finding that wives join the work after the husband could no longer support
them because of illness/death.
Significant strides have been taken by Government of Rajasthan in this direction by
launching the Silicosis Policy in October 2019. As per this policy, widow of a mine workers
died due to silicosis, will get all the social security benefits from the state government
including a monthly pension of up to Rs. 1500.27
On the other side of the coin, the mean age of entry into the mining occupation for males may
be lower because generation wise these families are following the patriarchal culture of
working in mines. So, the male members start working at early age to earn for their family,
giving very less priority to education. Sometimes the carry forwarded loans taken by their
ancestors also forced male members to start work in mines at early age.25
5. Child Labour
Child labour is physically, mentally, socially and morally dangerous and harmful to children,
and also negatively relates to school attendance and learning.28,29 Although there is provision
of free and compulsory education for children between 6 to 14 years of age, and prohibition
of employment of children between 14 to 18 years of age in hazardous occupations in
Constitution of India, yet child labour is quite prevalent in India.30 Children are forced into
labor and sometimes in hazardous occupations due to poverty and to pay family debt.31,32
Child labour was quite prevalent in the study area. This finding is well supported by the
prevalence of child labour reported in 2011 census survey of the country.30 A substantial
contribution of child labour force among mine workers has also been highlighted by
Murlidhar V. (2015).9 The existence of child labor in the mining industry is to supplement
the earning of parents.33 The other reason can be the premature death of bread earner due to
silicosis.34

6. Elderly mine workers
In the present study, most of the mine workers (78%) were in the age group of 20-49 years.
This corresponds to the age groups of miners observed by Solanki J et.al. (2014) and Nandi S
et.al. (2018) in Jodhpur district.35,36 Mine workers were belonging to almost all age groups
(adolescents to elderly) with mean age of 37.62 ± 12.30 years. Mining is a hazardous
occupation and is not considered safe workplace for elderly people. As much as 7.1% mine
workers were elderly in the present study. These findings are in accordance to the findings
reported by other studies.4,37
Conclusion
In the present study, it was found that most of the mine workers were in young age group and
predominantly males. Major social issues among mine workers were illiteracy, child
marriage, child labour, loneliness and shifting economic responsibilities on females. Based
on the findings it can be concluded that, economic responsibilities are shifting on vulnerable
shoulders (children, females and elderly) in sandstone mines in India.
