Abstract
Somatic genomic structural variations (SVs) are promising personalized biomarkers for
sensitive and specific detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in liquid biopsies.
However, affordable and fast identification of such SV biomarkers is challenging,
which hinders routine use in the clinic. Here, we developed a novel approach - termed
SHARC - for rapid discovery of somatic SVs as personalized tumor biomarkers. SHARC
combines low coverage cancer genome sketching by using Oxford Nanopore
sequencing with random forest classification and a dedicated filtering pipeline to
enrich for somatic SVs. Our method ​leverages the real-time and long-read capabilities
of nanopore sequencing to identify somatic SV breakpoints at nucleotide resolution
from a tumor tissue biopsy within three days. We applied SHARC to tumor samples of
high-grade ovarian and prostate cancer and validated on average ten somatic SVs per
sample with PCR mini-amplicons. An accompanying method for SV breakpoint
detection from liquid biopsies was devised based on digital PCR, enabling detection of
cancer in a quantitative manner. Using this method, we retrospectively monitored
treatment

Our work

demonstrates that SHARC forms a universal framework for rapid development of
personalized biomarker assays for blood-based monitoring of any cancer type.

Introduction
The pursuit of true precision medicine in oncology prompts us to improve the detection
of cancer recurrence as well as accurate and fast monitoring of response to treatment.
The current diagnostic paradigm for monitoring of cancer relies on imaging (CT/MRI
scans), which inherently lacks sensitivity for both the initial diagnosis and to detect
changes over time​1,2​. A promising approach to improve tumor detection is the use of
liquid biopsies, that can be used to detect circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from body
fluids, such as blood, in a minimally invasive manner​3,4​. In patients with cancer,
apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells shed fragmented DNA into the bloodstream
(circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA), which contributes to the total levels of cfDNA​5​. A
positive linear correlation between levels of ctDNA and tumor burden has been
observed for multiple cancer types​6,7​. Furthermore, previous studies successfully
utilized ctDNA to capture intra-tumoral genomic heterogeneity from all tumor
locations within one patient​8,9​. In multiple cases, ctDNA analysis identified cancer
recurrence months before clinical symptoms presented​10–12​.
The most commonly used biomarkers to differentiate between cfDNA from normal
cells and ctDNA from tumor cells are somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs).
However, detection of somatic SNVs in liquid biopsies requires high coverage
sequencing to reach sufficient sensitivity​3​. Moreover, the detection of these mutations
in plasma in a sensitive manner requires the design of mutation specific detection
assays or gene enrichment panels for ultra-deep sequencing of target loci​3,4​. Somatic
genomic structural variation (SV) may serve as another type of tumor-specific
biomarker to detect and quantify ctDNA with high sensitivity in liquid biopsies​11–14​.
Most common solid cancers contain dozens to hundreds of somatic SVs​15,16​. Besides
some recurrent gene fusions, like TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer, the vast majority of
these somatic SVs are patient- and tumor-specific​17​. Furthermore, SVs form a unique
breakpoint junction between two joined DNA strands and can be validated by
straightforward junction-spanning (quantitative) PCR assays​12​. Personalized detection
of somatic SVs could be a powerful addition to point-mutation based assays for
detection of ctDNA in patients with cancer.
Somatic SVs are commonly detected with short-read paired-end next generation
sequencing (NGS). However, as SVs can be very large, short reads are less suited for SV
detection, particularly in genomic regions with low complexity or in multi-breakpoint

events​18–20​.

Recently, long-read sequencing techniques from Oxford Nanopore

Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) have emerged and their increased
power for germline and somatic SV detection has been extensively demonstrated​19–23​.
Moreover, ONT enables a short turnaround time and real-time data analysis for clinical
applications​24​. ​We leveraged the long-read and fast sequencing capabilities of nanopore
sequencing to develop SHARC (​S​tructural c​h​anges ​a​s bioma​r​kers for ​c​ancer). Our
approach combines ONT-based low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) of tumor
tissue with a computational method to detect somatic SVs without the need for
sequencing a reference control sample. The computational part of SHARC combines
random forest classification and germline SV filtering to enrich for somatic SVs, which
subsequently enables the design of tumor-specific PCR-assays within three days. We
demonstrate the clinical applicability of SHARC by tracking somatic SVs in longitudinal
cfDNA samples of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

Results
Detection

of

somatic structural variations from low coverage nanopore

sequencing of tumor biopsies
To rapidly identify tumor-specific SV breakpoints, which can be used to track tumor
dynamics in blood, we developed SHARC. The first step of the SHARC assay involves
low coverage nanopore sequencing of genomic tumor-derived DNA (​Fig. 1A​). A single
nanopore run on the MinION or GridION platforms typically generates between 5-15
Gbs of data​25​, corresponding to 1.5-5x coverage of the human genome. Next, the low
coverage sequencing data are mapped to the reference genome followed by the
​ .
detection of SV breakpoint junctions from split read mappings (​Fig. 1B​)21​
Subsequently, a classification and filtering pipeline is applied to enrich for somatic SV
breakpoints (​Fig. 1B​). Finally, PCR assays with mini-amplicons are designed to validate
somatic SVs. SVs are confirmed as either somatic or germline by breakpoint PCR on
tumor and corresponding lymphocyte DNA (​Fig. 1C​). Successful breakpoint PCR assays
for somatic SVs detected with SHARC can then be utilized for ctDNA-based monitoring
of treatment response and disease recurrence (​Fig. 1D​).
Establishment of a somatic SV reference set to test SHARC
To verify the ability of our pipeline to detect somatic SVs, we used genomic data from
the melanoma cell line COLO829​26 and the ovarian cancer organoid line HGS-3​27​. We
utilized short-read WGS data from both lines (90x and 30x coverage for COLO829 and
HGS-3, respectively) and matching reference samples (30x coverage in both cases) to
establish two reference sets of somatic SVs (​Methods​). By using state-of-the-art SV

detection pipelines​16,28​, we detected 92 and 295 somatic SVs in COLO829 and HGS-3,
respectively. Additionally, we generated long-read nanopore sequencing data for
COLO829 and HGS-3, reaching high coverages of 59x ​(COLO829) and 56x ​(HGS-3)
(​Suppl. Fig. 1 and Suppl. Table 1​). To simulate low coverage long-read sequencing of
tumor genomes, we randomly subsampled the nanopore sequencing reads to
coverages of 4x, 3x and 2x. The subsampling was performed 20 times independently
for each case, to mitigate the effect of chance on the subsampling and subsequent
analysis.
Next, we tested the ability of SHARC to detect SVs from high and low coverage
nanopore sequencing data. SHARC uses NanoSV​21 to call SVs from the nanopore
sequencing data. In total, 82,918 (COLO829) and 85,039 (HGS-3) SV candidates were

called in the high coverage sets and an average of 12,886 (COLO829) and 11,284 (HGS-3)
SV candidates were called in the low coverage subsets (​Suppl. Table 2)​. Based on the
overlap with the somatic short-read reference set, raw SV calls were classified as
somatic (true-positives) or non-somatic (false-positives). The vast majority of the raw
SV calls in all the different coverage datasets were false-positives, on average 99.84%
(range 99.81-99.9%, COLO829) and 99.55% (range 99.4-99.74%, HGS-3) ​(Fig. 2A)​.
Nevertheless, in the high coverage datasets, we identified 84 (91% of the short-read
reference set, 0.1% of the total calls) and 219 (74% of the short-read reference set, 0.3%
of the total calls) true-positive somatic SVs for COLO829 and HGS-3, respectively (​Fig.
2A and Suppl. Fig. 2A​). The fraction of true-positives with respect to the total number
of SV calls was similar in the low coverage subsets (average of 0.18% and 0.5% for
COLO829 and HGS-3, respectively) (​Fig. 2A​). Thus, we show that we can identify
somatic SVs from both high and low coverage tumor-only nanopore sequencing data,
despite the major fraction of SV calls being false-positives.
Enrichment for true-positive SV calls from nanopore sequencing data
To reduce false-positive SV calls, we implemented a panel of filtering steps. First, we
selected only “PASS” SV calls (based on default NanoSV filter flags​21​, ​Methods​).
Secondly, we excluded calls involving chromosome Y or the mitochondrial genome.
Finally, we removed all insertions, since the exact inserted sequence cannot be
accurately defined, thus hampering the final PCR assay development at a later step. As
a result of these filtering steps, 72.6% (COLO829) and 76.2% (HGS-3) false-positive calls
were removed in the high coverage sets (​Fig. 2B and Suppl. Table 2)​. For the low
coverage sets, the filtering removed on average 50.9% (COLO829) and 49.9% (HGS-3) of
false-positive calls (​Fig. 2B and Suppl. Table 2​). In contrast, the vast majority of
somatic true-positive SV calls was maintained following SV filtering (on average 76.9%
in COLO829 and 93.9% in HGS-3, ​Fig. 2B​).
To further reduce the number of false-positive SV calls, we employed a random forest
(RF) machine learning approach (​Methods​), similarly as previously described for SV

calling of nanopore data​21​. We applied the RF classifier to the filtered high and low

coverage subsets of COLO829 and HGS-3. For the high coverage sets, the RF labelled
84% (COLO829) and 81.3% (HGS-3) of false-positive SV calls as false (​Fig. 2C​). For the
low coverage sets, on average 70.6% (COLO829) and 68% (HGS-3) of false-positive SV
calls were labelled as false (​Fig. 2C​). In addition, in the high coverage sets, 81.25%
(COLO829) and 97.88% (HGS-3) of true-positive SV calls were labelled as true. Similar

percentages of true-positive SV calls were labelled as true in the low coverage sets, on
average 73.7% (COLO829) and 98.6% (HGS-3) (​Fig. 2C​).
These results show that the RF classifier filters out the majority of false-positive
breakpoints, while maintaining true-positive somatic SV calls. However, germline SV
calls are also maintained at this step. Therefore, somatic true-positive SVs still
represent a minor fraction of the total remaining SV calls: 0.3% COLO829 high
coverage, 0.3% average COLO829 low coverage, 1% HGS-3 high coverage and 1%
average HGS-3 low coverage ​(Suppl. Fig. 2B).
To reduce the number of germline SVs, we implemented a blacklist filtering step.
Therefore, the remaining SV calls were overlapped with two databases (DBFilter): (i)
SharcDB, containing SV calls from nanopore sequencing of 12 samples (​Methods​) to
remove both germline SVs and nanopore-specific false-positives, and (ii) RefDB,
containing germline SV calls from 63 control samples previously sequenced using
Illumina WGS in our group (​Methods​). Following this filtering step, 100% of
true-positive somatic SV calls from both the COLO829 and HGS-3 high and low coverage
sets were retained (​Fig. 2D​). In contrast, 88.6% (COLO829, high coverage), 76.2%
(HGS-3, high coverage) and on average 89.9% (COLO829, low coverage) and 84.5%
(HGS-3, low coverage) of remaining false-positive SV calls were filtered out (​Fig. 2D​).
Due to this filtering, the fraction of true-positive somatic breakpoints in the remaining
SV calls in the high coverage set increased to 11.2% (COLO829) and 18.7% (HGS-3) and
to an average 6.6% (COLO829) and 15.6% (HGS-3) for the low coverage subsets (​Fig. 2E
and Suppl. Fig. 2A​).
Finally, to further enrich for somatic SVs, we implemented a ranking method. Based on
the observation that large SVs are more likely to be somatic than germline SVs (​Suppl.
Fig. 3​), we ranked the remaining events based on length. Selecting the Top20 largest SV
calls increased the percentage of true-positive somatic SVs to 85% (COLO829) and 65%
(HGS-3) in the high coverage sets, and to on average 43% (COLO829) and 64.1% (HGS-3)
in the low coverage sets (​Fig. 2E​).
Altogether, our SV filtering pipeline strongly enriches for true-positive somatic
breakpoints and filters out the majority of false-positives and germline SVs. We
demonstrate a total enrichment of true-positive somatic SV calls from 0.1% in the raw
calls to 85% in the final Top20 ranked calls (17/20, COLO829, high coverage), 0.26% to
65% (13/20, HGS-3, high coverage), on average 0.18% to 41.7% (8.3/20, COLO829, low

coverage sets) and on average 0.49% to 64.2% (12.8/20, HGS-3, low coverage sets) (​Fig.
2F and Suppl. Fig. 4​).
Validation of SHARC in tumor tissue from patients with ovarian and prostate
cancer
Next, we tested SHARC on four high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Ova1-4) and six
prostate cancer (Pros1-6) samples. We sequenced tumor DNA on one nanopore flow
cell per sample. The ovarian cancer samples and three prostate cancer samples
(Pros1-3) were sequenced on commercial ONT flow cells. For the ovarian cancer
samples, we started library preparation with minimally 1 µg of DNA. For the prostate
cancer samples limited material was available, and we started library preparation with
250 ng of DNA. For one sample (Pros3), not enough sequencing data was produced to
confidently detect somatic SVs and this sample was therefore excluded from all
subsequent analyses (​Suppl. Table 1)​. Three additional prostate cancer samples
(Pros4-6) were sequenced on ONT research prototype flow cells with higher sequencing
sensitivity, thus requiring less DNA input material. In these cases, library preparation
was started with an average of 108 ng (80-128 ng) of DNA and an average of 10 ng of
library was loaded for sequencing (​Suppl. Table 1)​. We obtained an average sequence
coverage of 2.3x (range: 1.8 - 4.0) (​Fig. 3A and Suppl. Table 1) and average read
lengths of 7.8 Kbp (range: 4.2-16.3 Kbp) (​Fig. 3B and Suppl. Table 1​). The sequencing
throughput was not affected by the lower DNA input when using the high-sensitivity
prototype flow cells. (​Suppl. Table 1)​.
On average we identified 8,488 (range 5,024-19,695) raw SV calls in these samples (​Fig.
3C). Following the pre-filtering, the RF classification and the database filtering steps, an
average 2.8% (range of 1.0%-4.4%) of SVs per sample were retained (​Fig. 3C​). We
performed breakpoint PCR assays on lymphocyte and tumor DNA for the Top20 ranked
SVs and validated an average of 50% (range 25-80%) somatic SVs per sample (​Fig. 3D​).
We investigated the recall of validated somatic SVs at different timepoints during the
sequencing run. We found that, on average, 81.6% (range 50-100%) of validated
somatic SVs were already detected within the first 24 hours of sequencing (​Suppl. Fig.
5)​. This offers the opportunity to reduce the sequencing time, accelerating our SHARC
assay with one day.

Detection of SVs, identified by SHARC, in cfDNA from patients with ovarian and
prostate cancer
To show the applicability of SHARC to detect clinically relevant biomarkers, we next
tested if we could detect the validated somatic SVs in cfDNA of patients. Ascites fluid,
which is known to contain cfDNA and ctDNA​29 was available for Ova2 at time of
recurrence. We extracted cfDNA from the ascites and tested all 16 validated somatic
SVs by PCR. 100% of somatic SVs could be detected within the cfDNA from ascites
(​Suppl. Fig.6​), and not in the germline or water controls. Next, we tested whether SVs
identified and validated by SHARC, could be detected in cfDNA from blood. Therefore,
we selected two patient-specific SVs for each of the four prostate cancer patients (Pros1,
4, 5 and 6) based on a high signal to noise ratio observed in qPCR assays for SV
breakpoints (​Fig. 4A and Methods​).
To enable sensitive and quantitative detection, we designed digital PCR (dPCR) assays
for the eight selected SVs (​Fig. 4B​). For each SV, we aimed to design a probe for both
wild-type alleles (up- and downstream) and for the mutant allele (across the breakpoint
junction). For five SVs we could design an assay that quantified both the wild-type
upstream and the wild-type downstream allele. For the three other SVs, primers/probes
for only one of the wild-type alleles were designed, as appropriate primer design for
the other allele was hindered by repetitive sequences at the target site. As the amount
of cfDNA within one liquid biopsy is limited, we used a conditional breakpoint
detection approach: (i) if dPCR on pre-amplified cfDNA (input pre-amplification: 0.2-1
ng cfDNA) confirmed the presence of the SV within cfDNA, (ii) then subsequent dPCR
on non-preamplified cfDNA (stock cfDNA) (input dPCR: 5 ng cfDNA) was performed.
The latter enabled calculation of both the variant allele frequency (VAF) and the
number of mutant molecules per milliliter plasma (MM/mL plasma). First, we selected
two timepoints per patient, one at baseline and one at progression of disease and
confirmed the presence of all eight SVs with dPCR on pre-amplified cfDNA (​Suppl Fig.
7​). Thereafter, dPCR on the stock cfDNA successfully detected all SVs in the four
patients, both in baseline and progression samples (​Fig. 4C and 4D​). Despite the fact
that the VAF in pre-amplified cfDNA correlates to the VAF in stock cfDNA (r​s ​= 0.928),
they should be considered two separate outcome measurements (regression coefficient
= 0.72 ≠ 1) (​Suppl. Fig. 8A​). Moreover, VAF based on the wild-type upstream allele was
highly similar to VAF based on the wild-type downstream allele in stock cfDNA (r​s =
​
0.996, regression coefficient = 1.05) (​Suppl. Fig. 8B​), suggesting no significant
imbalances between the two sides of the breakpoint.

Monitoring treatment response in patients with prostate cancer
In addition to the detection of SVs in cfDNA at baseline and progression of disease, we
explored the capacity to use SVs, identified with SHARC, to monitor treatment response
over time. To enable reliable response monitoring, measurements should be accurate
and repeatable. As VAFs are ratios and in principle not influenced by technical
variations between timepoints, we chose to report VAFs only. To verify the accuracy of
dPCR, we performed two technical replicates for all pre-amplified samples of Pros5 and
Pros6 and confirmed a high correlation of VAFs between the replicates (r​s =
0.987,
​
regression coefficient = 0.918) (​Suppl. Fig. 8C​). Finally, we quantified the eight SVs of
the four prostate cancer patients in the longitudinally collected samples from before,
during and after treatment. For Pros1, SV-A shows the potential to improve response
evaluation as its dynamics corresponds to the response to treatment with cabazitaxel
and increases towards the end of treatment, resulting in the highest levels at clinical
progression of disease (​Figure 4E​). These changes also seem to correlate with other
blood biomarkers, including PSA and ALP. In addition, SV-B in Pros1 similarly
correlates with response to treatment (​Figure 4E​). Also for Pros5 both SV-A and SV-B
show clear changes over time correlating with clinical parameters, and Pros4 and
Pros6 have less compelling dynamics of the detected SVs (​Suppl. Fig. 9A-C​).

Discussion
Recent studies have described the use of somatic SVs for tracking tumor burden from
liquid biopsies​11–14​. Although these studies showed the potential of this methodology,
they lacked sufficient turn-around time to have personalized biomarkers ready before
the initiation of patient treatment. This is a result of lengthy short-read WGS
approaches for SV detection and an associated substantial number of false-positive
somatic SVs, requiring laborious testing to validate SVs. To overcome these limitations,
we developed SHARC. SHARC utilizes the real-time and long-read capabilities of
nanopore sequencing combined with a machine learning approach to efficiently
identify somatic SVs from tumor tissue within three days. The rapid nature and simple
workflow of SHARC offers great potential for routine monitoring of cancer treatment
response or detection of recurring disease. We demonstrate the applicability of SHARC
to measure tumor burden by using a series of longitudinally gathered blood samples
from metastatic prostate cancer patients. SHARC provides a universal method that can
be applied for any cancer that is rich in somatic SVs.
Obtaining enough tumor material for DNA isolation is often a limiting factor for
next-generation sequencing assays​12​. We show that nanopore sequencing and somatic
SV detection is possible from limited amounts of DNA that can be extracted from a
tumor needle biopsy. DNA input can be decreased even further to as little as 80 ng
when using flow cells with increased sensitivity for DNA (research prototype flow cells
provided by ONT). Thus, our assay can also be applied to patients with metastatic
cancer that undergo a needle biopsy for diagnostic purposes, which is an important
requisite for clinical viability.
Long-read sequencing is an excellent method for the detection of SVs at nucleotide
resolution, even at low sequencing depth, because each long-read that bridges a
breakpoint-junction provides direct information on the breakpoint position and
sequence​21​. Sequencing of a tumor sample on a single GridION/MinION nanopore flow
cell generates insufficient sequencing data to establish an accurate genomic profile.
However, using the SHARC pipeline developed here, we efficiently enriched for somatic
SVs despite very low coverage and without germline sequencing data. These assets
make SHARC a cost-efficient assay for detection of somatic SVs as personalized cancer
biomarkers. Furthermore, on average 50% of the SVs resulting from our pipeline are
somatic, which minimizes the hands-on effort needed for validation purposes. For all
analyzed tumors in this study, we identified at least five somatic SV biomarkers per

patient, which is within the range described in previous work​11,13,30​. With expected
increases in sequencing throughput from ONT sequencing, the performance from the
SHARC pipeline will improve significantly. Furthermore, the use of cheap disposable
flow cells (Flongle) could reduced assay costs to ⅕ of the current sequencing price of
800€​31​. The minimal costs of this assay would enable the broader application of such
individualized SV tracing in patients with cancer.
We retrospectively applied SHARC to four patients with prostate cancer tracing levels
of ctDNA by using SVs and compared tumor-dynamics to clinical biomarkers such as
PSA and ALP. The quantitative measurement of SVs in ctDNA suggest that VAFs of SVs
correlate with tumor load (Pros1 and Pros5). Moreover, the SVs would have indicated
progression of disease earlier than PSA did in some patients (Pros1 and Pros 4). This
clearly illustrates the potential clinical utility of quantifying ctDNA with SVs identified
by SHARC to monitor response to treatment. However, further studies are needed to
determine the universal applicability of the methods and the characteristics of the SVs
that are particularly suitable for such strategies. Furthermore, SV-selection requires
further improvement, to not only select tumor-specific SVs, but also SVs that represent
the dominant disease clone. The approach of combining machine learning algorithms
and experimental data could prove useful in optimizing this part of the assay. Larger
prospective studies should confirm that indeed measuring SVs improves clinical
decision making in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
These data open the way to contemplate true individualized diagnostic platforms that
are affordable in the current day clinical practice. The use of ONT or other desktop
sequencing platforms combined with DNA printing machines that could provide
individualized primers as needed, would enable such individualized approaches. The
main barrier in curing cancer remains a lack of dynamic knowledge acquisition. We
are very well aware of the dynamic response of cancer to treatment but lack the tools
to monitor these changes in real time and thus generally respond to alterations too late
for true treatment success. Individualizing disease monitoring could increase
sensitivity to such levels that more intelligent treatment approaches could be
envisioned.

Materials and methods
Patients
Tumor samples of four patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (OC) and six
patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (PC) were used in this
study. Patients with OC participated in the HUB-OVI study, in which tumor tissue and
blood were obtained for organoid culture (tumor) and whole genome sequencing
(WGS) (tumor and blood). Clinical data was extracted from the patient file in
collaboration with the Dutch Cancer Registration. Patients with PC participated in both
the CPCT-02 study (NCT01855477) and the CIRCUS study (NTR5732), in which tumor
tissue from a metastatic lesion for WGS and longitudinal cfDNA samples were
obtained. Longitudinal ctDNA quantification was performed for four patients with PC.
Informed consent was obtained within all studies. Clinical data for patients with PC
were collected in an electronic case report form (ALEA Clinical). All studies were
performed according to the guidelines of the European Network of Research Ethics
Committees (EUREC) following european, national and local law.
DNA Isolation and nanopore sequencing:
COLO829 (ATCC® CRL-1974™) cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and grown according to standard procedures as recommended by
ATCC. DNA was isolated using a phenol chloroform protocol​32​. For some nanopore
sequencing runs, DNA was sheared using g-tubes (Covaris). DNA was size selected on
the PippinHT (Sage Science). Library preparation was performed using the Lib
SQK-LSK109 kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and DNA was then sequenced in 49
separate runs using R9.4 flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) on the MinION
(44), GridION (3) and PromethION (2) instruments ​(Suppl. Table 1)​.
HGS-3 organoid line was cultured following the ovarian cancer organoid culture
protocol​27​. DNA was isolated by using a phenol chloroform protocol​32​. DNA was size
selected on the PippinHT (Sage Science). Library preparation was performed using the
Lib SQK-LSK109 kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and DNA was then sequenced in
40 separate runs using R9.4 (23) and R9.5 (17) flow cells (Oxford Nanopore
Technologies) on the MinION (35) and GridION (5) instruments ​(Suppl. Table 1)​.
Tumor DNA from patients with ovarian cancer was isolated with the Genomic-tip kit
(Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol for tissue samples. DNA was prepared

for nanopore sequencing with the Lib SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).
The library from one tumor sample was loaded on one revD (Ova1) or R9.4 (Ova2-4)
flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Sequencing was performed on a MinION
(Ova2, Ova4) or GridION (Ova1, Ova3) instrument (Oxford Nanopore Technologies)
(Suppl. Table 1)​. Lymphocyte DNA for PCR validation assays was isolated from blood
with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen).
Tumor and germline DNA from patients with prostate cancer were obtained from a
fresh frozen core needle biopsy of a metastatic lesion and blood, respectively. DNA was
isolated on an automated setup with the QiaSymphony according to the supplier's
protocols (DSP DNA Midi kit for blood and DSP DNA Mini kit for tissue). In the context
of the CPCT-02 study, WGS was performed by the Hartwig Medical Foundation,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands​33​. Residual tumor DNA (80-250 ng) was used for nanopore
sequencing. DNA was prepared for nanopore sequencing with the Lib SQK-LSK109
(Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The library from one tumor sample was loaded on
one R9.4 (Pros1), revD (Pros2,3) or high-sensitivity research prototype (Pros4-6) flow
cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Sequencing was performed on a GridION
instrument (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) (​Suppl. Table 1​).
Illumina sequencing and analysis (COLO829 and HGS-3):
Short read WGS was obtained for matched tumor and normal DNA from the COLO829
cell line​34​ and the HGS-3 organoid line​27​.
SV calling was performed by using GRIDSS (v. 2.0.1)​28 in joint calling mode
(tumor+reference) for COLO829 and HGS-3 separately. Somatic SV calls were filtered as
in​34
(​https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline/blob/master/scripts/gridss_somatic_filter.R
)
SV calling and filtering pipeline:
The SHARC pipeline is available through ​https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/SHARC​.

Mapping is performed in parallel for each FASTQ file by using minimap2 (v. 2.12)​35
with settings “-x map-ont -a --MD”. The reference genome used is version GRCh37.
Sorting and merging of BAM files was done by using sambamba (v. 0.6.5)​36​. SV calling
was performed by using NanoSV (v. 1.1.2)​21​. Default NanoSV settings were used except
a minimum read count of 2 (cluster_count=2) and minimum mapping quality of 20
(min_mapq=20).

VCFs are filtered by using the command `awk ‘$7 == "PASS" && $1 !~ /(Y|MT)/ && $5 !~
/(Y|MT):/ && $5 != "<INS>"’` to select PASS calls and remove insertions and SVs
involving chromosomes Y or MT.
VCFs are then annotated with the distance to the closest single repeat element in the
reference genome​37,38​, the closest gap element in the reference genome​38,39​, and the
closest segmental duplication element in the reference genome​38​. These elements were
taken

from

the

UCSC

genome

browser (​http://genome.ucsc.edu/​)38​
​ , using the

GRCh37/hg19 genome version.
We trained a random forest (RF) model to filter out false-positive SV calls from
nanopore data, similarly as previously described​21​. We expanded the selection of input
features for the RF, by including read length, SV calling features, and overlap with
repeat features in the reference genome (​Suppl. Table 3​). We trained the classifier on

the well-characterized NA12787 Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) sample​25,40,41​, for which
high-quality germline SV call sets have been obtained by using Illumina​41 , PacBio​40 and
Nanopore​25 sequencing. The GIAB SV truth set was generated by intersecting these
three GIAB SV sets resulting in a set of 1,515 germline SVs. We used ⅔ of the GIAB truth
set as a training set and ⅓ as a test set. We established a precision-recall curve from 100
bootstrapping runs (​Suppl. Fig. 3)​, where the training data were split into 90%-10%
train-test subsets. Based on the precision-recall curve, we defined an operating point of
96% ​precision and 99.5% recall (​Suppl. Fig. 3). The final model was then re-trained on
the whole training set and tested on the ⅓ test set. The performance on the test set was
95.1% precision and 99.6% recall, representing an accuracy of 97.2% (​Suppl. Fig. 3)​. SV
candidates are classified as “true” or “false” based on this RF model.
We set up two databases of SV calls: (i) SHARCDB: containing raw NanoSV calls from
nanopore sequencing data of 14 samples: COLO829-T, COLO829-BL, HGS-3, VCAP
(prostate cancer cell line​42​), GIAB​25​, Ova1, Ova2, Ova3, Ova4, Pros1, Pros2, Pros4, Pros5
and Pros6 and (ii) RefDB: containing germline calls obtained from WGS short-read data
of 59 controls: 19 blood controls from patients with ovarian cancer​27​, where germline
SVs were called with Manta (v. 1.0.3)​43 with default parameters and 40 healthy
individuals (biological parents of individuals with congenital abnormalities)​44 where
germline SVs were called with Manta (v. 0.29.5)​43​ with default parameters.
SV calls from tumor samples are overlapped with those two databases by using
VCF-explorer (​https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/vcf-explorer​).
Only samples classified as “true” by the RF model and that do not overlap with any
sample in the databases qualify for primer design.

Primer design for filtered SV calls is automatized by using Primer3 (v. 1.1.4)​45 with a
product size range of 30-230 bp.
SVs with a successful primer design are ranked based on SV length and the 20 largest
are selected for PCR validation.
Breakpoint PCR
To validate SVs, breakpoint PCR with AmpliTaqGold (Applied Biosystems) was
performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 ng primary tumor DNA
(somatic) and 10 ng lymphocyte DNA (germline) per primer-pair were used as input.
PCR products were loaded and visualized on a 2% agarose gel.
cfDNA isolation
cfDNA was isolated from ascites fluid of Ova2 by using the ​QIAamp Circulating Nucleic
Acid Kit ​(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasma samples from
patients with prostate cancer were obtained longitudinally during treatment in 3x10
ml CellSave preservative tubes (Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Huntingdon Valley, PA,
USA) and processed within 96 hours as previously described​46​. Circulating DNA was
isolated with the QIAsymphony® DSP Circulating DNA Kit (Qiagen) according to
manufacturer’s protocol with some minor modifications​47​. All cfDNA samples were
quantified by Qubit​TM​ fluorometric quantitation (Invitrogen).
Quantitative PCR
As primer specificity is essential for reliable interpretation of an end-point assay like
dPCR, primers for the detection of structural variants were validated by quantitative
PCR (qPCR) on whole genome amplified (WGA) tumor and germline DNA. In brief,
qPCR was performed by using the CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the final reaction mix consisted of 10 µL SensiFAST​TM SYBR
® Lo-Rox mix (Bioline), 0.5 µM forward and reverse primers, 10 ng of WGA DNA and
Ultrapure DNas/RNAse free H​2​O to bring up the reaction volume to 20 µL. The Cycle
conditions were as follows: 14 cycles of 10s at 95°C and 30s at from 65-58°C
(touchdown), followed by 20-40 cycles of 10s at 95°C and 30s at 60°C. In addition, a melt
curve was generated from 56°C to 95°C to assess the generated PCR products. Based on
qPCR results, two primer sets for the detection of SVs in each patient were selected for
quantification by digital PCR (dPCR). Primer sets were excluded from use with dPCR

when one of the following ocurred: >1 PCR product, Cq​germline​- Cq​tumor <5 and/or Cq​tumor >
​
20.
DNA sonication and fragment size analysis
To mimic the length of cfDNA and improve DNA molecule partition, WGA DNA of both
tumor and germline were sonicated to a peak size of ~150 bp with the S220
Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
sonication conditions were as follows; 200-250 ng WGA DNA (concentration
determined by Qubit​TM fluorometric quantitation) in 50 µL Ultrapure DNas/RNAse free
H​2​O, Peak Incident Power: 175 W, Duty Factor: 10 %, Cycles per Burst: 200, Treatment
Time: 280 s, Temperature: 7°C, and Water Level: 12. After sonication DNA fragment
sizes were analyzed with the High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies) on the
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and the sample concentration was re-quantified by
Qubit​TM​ fluorometric quantitation (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Design of digital PCR assays for absolute quantification of SVs in cfDNA
To quantify SVs in cfDNA, dPCR was performed. First, the exact position of the
breakpoint as determined by nanopore sequencing was validated. We used already
available sequenced Illumina data from the CPCT-02 study (Pros1, Pros4, Pros5 and
Pros6), but Sanger sequencing of the particular qPCR product could be used as well. To
enable quantification of both mutant and wild-type alleles, additional primers for the
detection of wild-type upstream (WT-U) allele and wild-type downstream (WT-D) allele
of the breakpoint and fluorescent probes for both mutant and wild-type alleles were
developed by using the Primer Express Software v3.0 (ThermoFisher) and the online
tool Primer3Plus​45​. All primers and fluorescent probes (​Suppl. Table 4​) were ordered
from Eurogentec.
Pre-amplification of cfDNA
To enable sensitive detection of multiple SVs in limited amounts of cfDNA, two SVs per
patient were pre-amplified with 0.2-1 ng of cfDNA. Pre-amplified tumor and germline
DNA

samples

were

used

as

respectively

positive

and

negative

control.

Pre-amplification was performed by using 4 µL of TaqMan™ PreAmp Master Mix
(cat.no: 4488593, Life Technologies), 2 µL primer pool (0.25 µM) consisting of SV
forward (SV-F) and reverse (SV-R) primers and upstream (WT-U) and downstream
(WT-D) wild-type primers, and 2 µL (cf)DNA for a total volume of 8 µL.
Pre-amplification cycle conditions were: 10 min at 95°C followed by 14 cycles of 15 s at

95°C and 4 min at 60°C, and finally pause at 4°C. After the pre-amplification reaction, 72
µL of Ultrapure DNase/RNAse free H​2​O was added to each sample. Next, pre-amplified
cfDNA was diluted 40x per 1 ng input, used for the pre-amplification, to prevent
overloading of the dPCR chips.
Absolute quantification of SVs in cfDNA with digital PCR
For the quantification of SVs in (cf)DNA, dPCR was performed with the Naica Crystal
PCR system (Stilla Technologies) by using the following optimized reaction mix: 1 µL of
diluted pre-amplified (cf)DNA sample, 5.6 µL PerfeCTa Multiplex qPCR ToughMix
(Cat.No: 733-2322PQ, Quantabio). 0.25 µM probes (SV​FAM​, WT-U​HEX​, WT-D​CY5​), 0.75 µM of
the SV forward (SV-F) and reverse primer (SV-R), 0.25 µM of the WT-U and WT-D
primers, 0.1 µM Fluorescein (Cat.No: 0681-100G, VWR) and Ultrapure DNAse/RNAse
free H​2​O to bring up the total volume to 28 µL. Samples were loaded onto Stilla
Sapphire chips (Cat.no. C13000, Stilla Technologies) and dPCR was performed with the
same cycle conditions as for the primer validation with qPCR. Median number of
analyzable droplets was 21,357, inter quartile range 19,837-22,736. dPCR reactions
were optimized with 10 ng sonicated tumor and germline WGA DNA. When an SV
could be detected in pre-amplified cfDNA samples, a dPCR of all longitudinal cfDNA
samples was performed on 5 ng of stock (no pre-amplification) cfDNA to enable
absolute quantification of mutant molecules in plasma.
Statistics
qPCR experiments were analyzed with Bio-Rad CFX Manager version 3.1. dPCR
experiments were analyzed with Crystal Miner™ software, version 2.1.6 (Stilla
Technologies). Thresholds for positive fluorescence were determined per primer pair
based on positive and negative controls. Variant allele frequency (VAF) was calculated
according to the following formula:
number of mutant molecules per µl in chip (as defined by Crystal Miner™ software) /
(number of mutant molecules per µl in chip + number of wild-type molecules per µl in
chip) * 100%.
Absolute number of mutant molecules per mL plasma was calculated as follows:
number of mutant molecules per µl in chip * 28 µl (input in chip) / (used eluate/total
volume of eluate * volume of plasma used for isolation).
To correct for zero values on a log scale, +1 was counted to every value and axes were
corrected with -1. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated for comparisons of

(​A​) (Needle) biopsy or resection from a tumor as well as blood are obtained from a
patient at initial diagnosis. Germline DNA (red) and cfDNA (blue) isolated from blood
and tumor DNA (brown) from tumor material. Tumor DNA is sequenced on one ONT
flow cell. (​B​) Tumor-specific SV detection and filtering is performed with the
bioinformatic SHARC pipeline. (​C​) SV-specific breakpoint spanning primers are
designed. Breakpoint PCR with SV-specific primers is performed on germline and
tumor DNA to confirm somatic SVs. (​D​) Somatic SVs are used as biomarkers and traced
within cfDNA from a patient to monitor disease dynamics in a longitudinal manner.

Figure 2 : Detection of somatic SVs with the SHARC pipeline based on high and low
coverage nanopore data.
High coverage nanopore sequencing data from COLO829 (melanoma cell line) and
HGS-3 (ovarian cancer organoid) were subsampled to low coverages. Outer circles
represent the high coverage sets (59x for COLO829 and 56x for HGS-3) and inner circles
represent low coverage subsets (4x 3x, 2x). ​A​) Median percentage of non-somatic (red)
and somatic (blue) breakpoints in the raw NanoSV calls for COLO829 (top) and HGS-3
(bottom). (​B​) Median percentage of non-somatic (left) and somatic (right) SV calls kept
(green) or removed (brown) in the pre-filtering step for COLO829 and HGS-3. (​C​)
Median percentage of non-somatic (left) and somatic (right) SV calls kept (green) or
removed (brown) by the Random Forest SV classifier for COLO829 and HGS-3. (​D​)
Median percentage of non-somatic (left) and somatic (right) SV calls kept (green) or
removed (brown) by the database filtering for COLO829 and HGS-3. (​E​) Median
percentage of non-somatic (red) and somatic SV (blue) calls in the complete SHARC
output (left) and top 20 largest SVs (right) for COLO829 and HGS-3. (​F​) Total number of
non-somatic (red) and somatic (blue) SV calls at each step of the pipeline for both
COLO829 and HGS-3. In low coverage subsets, all data points are shown and the square
box represents the median value. RF: Random forest; DBFilter: Database filter.

low-pass nanopore tumor sequencing data
Plots showing the distribution of (​A​) coverage and (​B​) read length for the nine tumor
samples sequenced on one flow cell each. Dashed lines represent averages for each
sample. (​C​) Total number of somatic SVs present at each of the steps throughout the SV
calling and filtering pipeline. RF: Random forest; DBFilter: Database filter (​D​) The
Top20 ranked breakpoints for each sample were tested by breakpoint PCR using tumor
and germline DNA. Graph depicts the number of breakpoints validated as somatic
(blue), germline (green) or breakpoints that could not be validated (red).

quantification of tumor-specific SVs, identified by SHARC, in cfDNA from blood by
using qPCR and dPCR. (​B​) Primer and probe design for dPCR. The wild-type upstream
and wild-type downstream allele share each one primer with the mutant allele. Three
probes with different fluorescents were designed to specifically detect the mutant allele
or one of the wild-type alleles. (​C​) Detection of two tumor-specific SVs in cfDNA from
blood from four patients with prostate cancer at baseline and at progression of disease
with dPCR. Shown are VAF and (​D​) mutant molecules per mL plasma. (​E​)
