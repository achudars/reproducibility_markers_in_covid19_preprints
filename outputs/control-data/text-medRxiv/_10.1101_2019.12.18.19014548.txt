Clinical research in neurodevelopmental disorders remains reliant upon clinician and caregiver
measures. Limitations of these approaches indicate a need for objective, quantitative, and reliable
biomarkers to advance clinical research. Extant research suggests the potential utility of multiple
candidate biomarkers; however, effective application of these markers in trials requires additional
understanding of replicability, individual differences, and intra-individual stability over time. The
Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is a multi-site study designed to
investigate a battery of electrophysiological (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) indices as candidate
biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study complements published biomarker
research through: inclusion of large, deeply phenotyped cohorts of children with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) and typical development; a longitudinal design; a focus on well-evidenced candidate
biomarkers harmonized with an independent sample; high levels of clinical, regulatory, technical, and
statistical rigor; adoption of a governance structure incorporating diverse expertise in the ASD

biomarker discovery and qualification process; prioritization of open science, including creation of a
repository containing biomarker, clinical, and genetic data; and use of economical and scalable
technologies that are applicable in developmental populations and those with special needs. The
ABC-CT approach has yielded encouraging results, with one measure accepted into the FDA’s
Biomarker Qualification Program to date. Through these advances, the ABC-CT and other biomarker
studies in progress hold promise to deliver novel tools to improve clinical trials research in ASD.

There are currently no validated biomarkers for use in clinical trials in autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). Clinical research remains reliant upon standardized but intrinsically subjective
clinician and caregiver/self-report measures. These tools have supported significant but incomplete
progress in diagnosis, selection of intervention, and measurement of treatment response; however,
advancement on other key objectives, such as designation of subgroups of individuals (i.e.,
stratification) within this heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition, have stagnated. Notably, the
most recent diagnostic taxonomy for ASD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) discarded
behaviorally defined subtypes because they were not reliable and had limited utility for treatment
selection or determination of prognosis (Lord, Petkova, et al., 2012). As highlighted by other articles
in this collection (Ewen, Sweeney, & Potter, 2019), there is a widely recognized and urgent need for
biomarkers to support clinical research in ASD (McPartland, 2017).
This Frontiers in Neuroscience Perspective highlights the specific challenges that have
impeded progress in biomarker research in ASD and presents the rationale, design, and progress of
the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT). The ABC-CT is a multisite study
specifically designed to evaluate a set of promising EEG and eye-tracking (ET) markers while
addressing shortcomings of prior research and establishing a comprehensive approach to biomarker
validation in ASD. Within this context, we describe the study design of the ABC-CT in terms of
specific strategies implemented to address limitations of published research and to provide
opportunities for enhancing understanding of ASD biomarkers. We highlight recent advances that
have been made in the context of this project and describe recommended directions for future
investigation.

A primary factor slowing progress in biomarker development for ASD is the heterogeneity
associated with the disorder. The diagnosis of ASD is based on a constellation of widely variable
behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Additional phenotypic variability is introduced
by associated non-diagnostic features, such as intellectual disability, and comorbidities, such as
epilepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Myriad genetic, epigenetic and environmental
factors contribute to the etiology of ASD. While there is some neurobiological convergence in
common neural circuits, many upstream molecular pathways lead to this disruption of network
function (Jeste & Geschwind, 2014). Given that biomarker development strategies frequently focus
on measurement of an identified mechanism, the challenge in ASD is significant, as candidate
biological factors are selected, in large part, by purported connection to behavior rather than a clearly
defined biological pathway. For example, impaired social-communication is a hallmark and universal
feature of ASD, but there is neither a single neural pathway for nor standard means of quantifying
social-communication. The lack of clear target mechanisms is further complicated by the dynamic
and variable nature of human development. In a neurodevelopmental condition in which symptoms
evolve and change throughout the lifespan, applicability of biomarkers across ages is uncertain.

Other impediments to biomarker development in ASD reflect elements of the research
enterprise itself. Multiple factors, such as high costs of human subjects research and limitations on
recruitment in single site studies, encourage dissemination with the minimal viable sample size, often
permitting assessment of group discrimination or simple associations but not analysis of complex
interactions or stratification. Such small studies may also be prone to generation of spurious or
idiosyncratic results that are unlikely to replicate. Even in biomarker studies utilizing large samples,
the task of understanding individual differences and relationships to the clinical phenotype is only
possible with deep phenotyping of these behavioral and clinical correlates, which is resource
intensive. Publication and procurement of research funding explicitly value innovation, creating a
pressure to explore novel biomarkers that is, to some degree, at odds with the goal of examining the
replicability and reproducibility of well-studied biomarkers to provide more conclusive evidence of
viability. Even fewer studies include a designated replication sample to verify findings in an
independent group.
For even the most well-studied biomarkers in ASD, there are several near universal gaps in
understanding. Methodological rigor, such as variation among studies, is a significant and poorly
understood concern. Factors such as stimulus presentation, experimental design, and variation in
hardware and software could all influence biomarker measurement in unpredictable ways. For most
biomarkers, it is not understood whether or how such factors contribute to observed variability in
results. Few biomarker studies have included multiple sampling points in a longitudinal design,
preventing inference regarding the stability of measurement in a person over time (i.e., test-retest
reliability, developmental stability). This is critical information for the potential use of biomarkers in
clinical trials.

The scientific objectives of the ABC-CT were to evaluate a set of candidate EEG and ET
biomarkers, alongside lab-based tasks, in terms of: (1) feasibility of administration in children with
ASD; (2) reliability of data collection across sites; (3) construct validity of the assays (i.e., whether
they manipulated neural processes as predicted in TD children); (4) test-retest reliability; (5) ability
to discriminate children with ASD from those with TD; (6) utility for stratification into meaningful
subgroups of children with ASD; (7) association with clinical phenotype; (8) developmental
stability/sensitivity to change in symptom severity. Below we describe specific elements of ABC-CT
study design intended to address the aforementioned challenges for biomarker development in ASD
(Sections 3.1 to 3.6), as well as additional features of the study innovated for this purpose (Sections
3.7-3.9).

A considerable strength of the ABC-CT was the administration of the selected paradigms in a
large sample of children with ASD and TD. The study enrolled 280 children with ASD and 119
children with typical development (TD). Heterogeneity in the sample was considered carefully. Age
range was constrained from 6 to 11 years to limit age-related confounds. Presence of a known genetic
syndrome or neurological condition putatively causally related to ASD or known metabolic disorder
and/or mitochondrial dysfunction were exclusionary criteria. Because medication use may influence
biomarker measurement, a stable regimen was required for 8 weeks prior to enrollment; all
medications were allowed in order to enroll a representative sample. Cognitive ability spanned full
scale IQ from 60 to 150, as assessed by the Differential Ability Scales – 2nd Edition (Elliott, 2007),
to permit evaluation of the feasibility of biomarker ascertainment procedures across a range of

An extensive phenotyping battery provided rigorous characterization, including observation,
interview, and multiple perspectives (i.e., clinician and caregiver). Diagnostic characterization relied
upon research gold standard instruments: DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD based on the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule (Lord, Rutter, et al., 2012) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised
(Rutter, LeCouteur, & Lord, 2003). Clinician administered assessments also included the Differential
Ability Scales, 2nd Edition (Elliott, 2007), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd Edition
(Sparrow, Cicchetti, & Saulnier, 2016). Caregiver questionnaires included the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist (Aman, Singh, Stewart, & Field, 1985), the Autism Impact Measure (Kanne et al., 2014),
the Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory (Cohen & Sudhalter, 2005), and the
Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition (Constantino & Gruber, 2012). To assess clinical status, the
Clinical Global Impression Scale (Guy, 1976) was employed, as this scale is widely used as an
outcome measure in pharmacologic treatment studies. Finally, interventions and medications utilized
both prior to and during the course of study participation were carefully recorded. The study was thus
positioned to evaluate biomarkers with respect to current best practices in terms of clinical
assessment.

Candidate biomarkers were selected to measure social-communicative function or related
processes, to be feasible in children with ASD across a wide range of functioning, and to be scalable
for clinical trials (Section 3.9). Importantly, all biomarkers had been studied in prior research and had
shown strong potential to distinguish between children with ASD and TD children or to correlate
with clinical characteristics. Four EEG paradigms and five ET paradigms were included in the ABCCT main study biomarker battery. EEG tasks included: resting state, with eyes open, acquired during
viewing of abstract videos (Wang et al., 2013); N170 event-related potential (ERP) to upright human
faces, compared to inverted faces and non-social stimuli (McPartland, Dawson, Webb, Panagiotides,
& Carver, 2004); ERPs to biological motion, contrasting signal between coherent and scrambled
point-light animations of walking adults (Kroger et al., 2014); and visual evoked potentials, in
response to presentation of phase-reversing black and white checkerboards (Siper et al., 2016). ET
tasks included: activity monitoring, comparing percentage of ocular focus (POF) to human faces and
heads during videos of highly structured shared activities (Shic, Bradshaw, Klin, Scassellati, &
Chawarska, 2011); visual attention to biological motion, quantified as POF to biological motion
versus scrambled and rotating point-light animations (Annaz, Campbell, Coleman, Milne, &
Swettenham, 2012; Klin & Jones, 2008); pupillary light reflex (PLR), measuring relative pupil
constriction amplitude and latency in response to a flash of light (Nystrom, Gredeback, Bolte, &
Falck-Ytter, 2015); an interactive social task, measuring POF to human heads and faces during
videos of two children at play (Chevallier et al., 2015); and static scenes, measuring POF to human
heads and faces during images showing naturalistic scenes of children and adults (Loth et al., 2017).

The ABC-CT coordinated study design and analyses with other networks engaged in ASD
biomarker studies. For several biomarker assays (N170 ERP, ET static scenes, ET biological motion,
ET PLR), acquisition paradigms were harmonized with the European Autism Interventions

coordinated processing pipelines and analytic strategies to ensure comparability of study results. The
Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine (JAKE; Ness et al., 2017) study applied several conceptually
analogous assays (e.g., a face ERP biomarker with a different acquisition paradigm), enabling
evaluation of robustness of results across different assays.

The study design incorporated a high level of methodological rigor in terms of both clinical and
biomarker data acquisition. Identical equipment was used for EEG (EGI 128 channel system) and ET
(SR Research EyeLink System) data acquisition and processing at all five data collection sites;
equipment was installed and tested by a central data acquisition team to ensure identical setup
parameters. Detailed manuals of procedures (MOPs) were established for all biomarker paradigms
and standardized protocols were adopted for data collection, processing, and analysis (Webb et al.,
2019). Likewise, MOPs guided clinical data collection, and all staff underwent comprehensive
training, addressing participant screening, clinical measurement, biomarker data collection
procedures, data entry, and study management processes. Fidelity in procedures was maintained for
clinical measurement through regular conference calls and monitoring of clinical interview reliability
within and across sites. Rigor was enhanced via conduct of the study according to Good Clinical
Practice standards, optimizing ABC-CT infrastructure for the conduct of clinical trials.

The naturalistic, longitudinal design of the ABC-CT allowed for the examination of test-retest
reliability and stability over time, paralleling the structure and timeline of a clinical trial. Children
were assessed across three time points (Time 1: Baseline, Time 2: 6 weeks after baseline, and Time
3: 24 weeks after baseline). At each time point, clinical assessments, parent-rated measures of social
impairment, independent ratings of clinical status, and the biomarker battery were completed. These
time points were selected to provide information about short-term test-retest reliability (6 weeks) and
developmental stability/change over time (24 weeks).

The ABC-CT adopted a complex governance structure to incorporate expertise relevant to
biomarker development (See Figure 1). Funded through a NIH U19 collaborative agreement, the
project was a public/private partnership that brought together specialists spanning academia,
government agencies, and industry. Administration of the project was overseen by a Steering
Committee including ABC-CT members, as well as the Program Officer and project scientists
associated with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH). The ABC-CT was designated a project of the FNIH Biomarkers Consortium,
and a Biomarkers Consortium Project Team was assembled to provide additional guidance from
experts from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, drug development and neuroscience,
autism biomarker projects in industry (JAKE), EU-AIMS, the Simons Foundation, and FDA
scientists from the Division of Psychiatry Products. An External Advisory Board included specialists
in ASD clinical trial design, an individual with ASD, a family member of individuals with ASD,
neurogeneticists, and experts in the conduct of large scale ASD biomarker studies. These three
groups informed study design, study conduct, interpretation of results, and preparation of biomarker
qualification documentation.

Efficient sharing of all study data was a priority for the ABC-CT. All data were uploaded to the
National Database for Autism Research (NDAR, a database within the National Institute of Mental
Health Data Archive) on a quarterly basis and made publicly available within four months of
uploading (permitting time for quality assurance and control). Blood samples collected from
participants and available biological parents have been shared via the NIMH Repository and
Genomics Resource (www.nimhgenetics.org). Through a collaboration facilitated by the FNIH
Biomarkers Consortium, samples are being genotyped, creating a publicly available repository with
complete clinical, biomarker, and genotypic information across the large, longitudinal sample.

Biomarker acquisition modalities utilized in the ABC-CT were selected based on their potential
to yield high public health impact. Both EEG and ET are relatively economical biomarker assays,
particularly within the class of neurophysiological or neurobehavioral measurements. These methods
are also highly scalable and accessible, with electrophysiological recording facilities widely available
in existing health care systems, supporting efficient large-scale implementation with extant
infrastructure. Though ET is not readily available in most health care settings, commercially
available products can be obtained at low cost. These technologies are applicable across a
developmental range (e.g., infancy though adulthood) and to individuals with neurodevelopmental
conditions and intellectual disabilities.

The ABC-CT was initiated in July 2015. After a series of in-person meetings and
teleconferences involving project governance, a feasibility study of 25 children with ASD and 26 TD
children was conducted between December 2015 and March 2016. Based on results of the Feasibility
Study, the Main Study design (described in this manuscript) was finalized (for details of review of
feasibility and transition to main study: see Webb et al., 2019 sections 2.6 and 2.7). The first subject
in the Main study was enrolled in October 2016, data collection was completed in May 2019, and
final analyses of the complete data set are in progress, with planned dissemination in Spring 2020.
Based on strong performance of the N170 biomarker at interim analyses conducted in April
2018, a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the N170 latency to upright human faces was submitted to the
FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Biomarker Qualification Program (BQP) in
November, 2018. In May, 2019, this index was accepted into the Biomarker Qualification Program
(https://www.fda.gov/drugs/cder-biomarker-qualification-program/biomarker-qualificationsubmissions), marking a milestone for the field as the first biomarker for a neurodevelopmental
disorder or psychiatric condition accepted into the BQP. A Biomarker Qualification Plan, the second
step in the program, for the N170 is in development. In October 2019, a second LOI was submitted
for the ET biomarker, Oculomotor index of orienting to human faces. Ongoing analyses will
determine the appropriateness of other candidate biomarkers for potential submission to the BQP.
As outlined above, the ABC-CT was designed to evaluate promising biomarkers in several
areas. The large sample and thorough characterization enable inference regarding group
discrimination and relationships among the biomarkers, as well as evaluation of individual
differences in clinical characteristics and demographic factors. The longitudinal design provides
information about test-retest reliability and developmental stability. However, there are several
biomarker properties that the ABC-CT was not designed to address. Because it was a naturalistic

longitudinal study, without an active treatment, there is limited clinical change observed in
participants during the six month course of the study, limiting the ability to evaluate biomarker
sensitivity to change. This key objective may be addressed in future research by studies that evaluate
biomarkers in the context of intervention or through naturalistic studies in younger cohorts, receiving
initial diagnoses and being channeled into their first interventions, when significant progress in a six
month span may be more likely. It is important to recognize that generalizability of the ABC-CT
results to other populations has not yet been established; although extant research provides strong
evidence of the potential utility of these biomarkers in other cohorts (e.g., younger/older children and
adults, individuals with IQ below 60), studies of the scope and rigor of the ABC-CT have yet to be
conducted and may be required before biomarker qualification in these groups can be pursued.

The ABC-CT represents a comprehensive, collaborative approach to biomarker development
in ASD. Building upon a strong foundation of prior research that has put forward candidate markers,
the ABC-CT has advanced understanding by innovating in terms of study design and scope. The field
of neurodevelopmental disorders has emerged as a leader within psychiatry, with the first biomarker
of this nature accepted into the FDA’s BQP. We move closer to a scientific reality in which clinical
research may rely upon objective and sensitive biological measurements to bolster the clinical
instruments on which we currently rely. The ABC-CT seeks to provide a foundation upon which
novel treatments for ASD can be rigorously evaluated and that, ultimately, may lead to more
effective methods for diagnosing and treating ASD.
