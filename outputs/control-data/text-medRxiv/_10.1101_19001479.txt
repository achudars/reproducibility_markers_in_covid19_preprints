Abstract

48

Carriage duration of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is uncertain. We

49

followed 21 CPE carriers over one year. Mean carriage duration was 86 (95%CrI= [60, 122])

50

days, with 98.5% (95%CrI= [95.0, 99.8]) probability of decolonization in one year. Antibiotic

51

consumption was associated with prolonged carriage. CPE-carriers' status should be reviewed

52

yearly.

Introduction

55

The rapid global dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) poses a

56

public health threat [1]. The lack of effective therapy is associated with high mortality and

57

healthcare costs [1]. Infection prevention and control are important measures to prevent the

58

spread of CPE to vulnerable patients.

59
60

Early identification, isolation, and contact precautions are advocated by international guidelines

61

to prevent the spread of CPE in healthcare settings [2,3]. Understanding the natural history and

62

duration of CPE carriage will help in the design of rational infection control policies. In this

63

study, we estimate carriage duration of CPE in a hospital cohort and identify risk factors for

64

prolonged carriage.

65
66

Methods

67

We conducted a prospective cohort study involving CPE carriers from October 2016 to February

68

2018. Study participants were recruited from two tertiary centers with over 1600 beds in

69

Singapore. All admitted patients above 21 years with prior hospitalization within 12 months were

70

screened for CPE carriage. We collected stool samples from study participants on enrolment,

71

weekly for four weeks, monthly for five months, then bimonthly for six months. Demographic

72

characteristics, healthcare contact and medication history were recorded. The study received

73

ethics approval from the Singapore National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board

74

(NHG DSRB Reference: 2016/00364) prior to commencement.

75
76

Stool samples were inoculated onto selective chromogenic agar (ChromID Carba SMART), and

77

species identification was done with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-

78

mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF (Bruker)). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed

79

using VITEK-2. All Enterobacteriaceae isolates with a minimum inhibitory concentration of

80

≥2mg/L for meropenem, or ≥1.0mg/L for ertapenem, underwent polymerase chain reaction

81

(PCR) for the presence of blaNDM-1, blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaIMI-1 and blaIMP genes [4]. All CPE

82

isolates and stool DNA underwent sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer. The

83

Shannon diversity index was used to measure α-diversity for stool microbial communities [5].

84
85

We analyzed the data with Bayesian multi-state Markov models to account for interval censoring

86

(Supplementary material). First, we estimated the overall transmission rates by considering

87

patients to be in either CPE colonized or non-colonized states. Secondly, we considered CPE

88

colonization on a species level, and included CP-Escherichia coli (CP-EC) colonized, CP-

89

Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-KP) colonized, CP-EC/KP co-colonized as separate states

90

(Supplementary figure 1). All analyses were performed using R 3.4.4 and RStan [6,7].

93

Twenty-one patients were enrolled with a mean follow-up period of 294 (SD=77) days, and each

94

participant provided 12 (SD=1.5) samples. Patient details on demographics and medical history

95

are in Table 1.

96
97

Throughout follow-up, 15/21 (71.4%) participants carried more than one species of CPE, while

98

only 3/21 (14.3%) participants carried more than one type of carbapenemase genes (χ² of

99

difference in proportions=14.8, simulated p-value=0.0005) (Supplementary table 1). The most

100

common species carried by the participants were K. pneumoniae (18/21, 85.7%) and E. coli

101

(16/21, 76.2%). The most frequently observed carbapenemase genes were OXA-48 (11/21,

102

52.4%) and KPC (8/21, 38.1%). Seventy-six CP-KP were isolated from the samples, out of

103

which sequence type (ST) 307 (25/76, 32.9%) was the most common. Amongst the CP-EC

104

isolates, ST131 (22/83, 26.5%) was the most common. Most participants (17/21, 81.0%) had

105

continuously positive samples until clearance. Four participants had negative samples followed

106

by positive samples, with the longest period being three negative samples over three consecutive

107

weeks (Figure 1).

108
109

The estimated mean duration of CPE carriage was 86 (95%CrI= [60, 122]) days. The probability

110

of decolonization was 98.5% (95%CrI= [95.0, 99.8]) in one year, assuming a constant

111

decolonization rate within the time interval. The longest observed carriage duration was 387

112

days. We analyzed age, co-colonization with other multidrug resistant organisms, presence of

113

urinary catheter, antibiotic use during follow up, Charlson comorbidity index, re-admission, and

114

Shannon diversity index as covariates to explore their association with decolonization

115

(Supplementary Figure 2). Antibiotic use during follow up was the only factor associated with

116

prolonged CPE carriage (HR= 0.48, 95%CrI= [0.20,0.93]). The rate of decolonization from CP-

117

EC was lower than that of CP-KP (0.018/day, 95%CI=[0.007,0.031] versus 0.030/day,

118

95%CI=[0.016, 0.049]) (Supplementary table 2 and figure 3).

119
120

Discussion

121

CPE infections are typically preceded by asymptomatic carriage, especially in vulnerable

122

patients such as the immunocompromised and critically ill [8]. Active surveillance to identify

123

CPE carriers is essential to prevent transmissions, but may be associated with high cost-benefit

124

ratio if implemented without understanding the natural history of CPE carriage.

125
126

Previous reports of CPE carriage duration are highly varied, with median duration ranging from

127

43 days to 295 days[8,9]. This is likely due to different follow-up schedules, microbiological and

128

molecular methods used to identify CPE, and criteria to define clearance. Studies that reported

129

longer carriage duration tended to adopt an opportunistic sampling strategy, and considered both

130

clinical and stool samples to determine carriage [9]. Opportunistic sampling may lead to

131

selection bias as patients with more healthcare contacts would have more samples taken.

132

Infrequent and inconsistent sampling is more likely to misclassify re-colonization from a new

133

transmission event as continuous colonization, resulting in perceived longer duration of carriage.

134
135

Our systematic sampling and robust methods to identify CPE allowed us to closely follow the

136

participants’ carriage status. With combined detection methods of culture on carbapenem-

137

resistance selective media, antibiotic susceptibility testing and PCR, we found that a proportion

138

of patients (4/21, 19.0%) had intervening negative samples, ranging from one to three weeks

139

apart. To confidently declare eradication, a patient should have at least two negative samples

140

four to six weeks apart. Given that the probability of decolonization is 98.5% in one year, we

141

suggest that CPE carriers status should be maintained for one year. Further health economics

142

analysis is needed to make institution-specific recommendations on frequency of re-screening.

143

Given the finding that antibiotic use was the most important factor associated with prolonged

144

CPE carriage, antibiotics should be avoided if not clinically indicated.

145
146

An interesting finding is that the participants carried more species of CPE than types of

147

carbapenemase genes. While this may be due to new acquisition events, this observation is more

148

parsimoniously explained by active interspecies horizontal gene transfer especially in a low-

149

transmission setting such as in Singapore. Differential rate of clearance of CP-KP and CP-EC

150

can be related to colonizing affinity of the species and fitness cost of carbapenemase genes,

151

which are highly variable amongst different species [10]. Further studies incorporating both

152

between and within host transmission dynamics of resistance will be important to shed light on

153

the roles of bacterial clones and plasmids in spreading and maintaining resistance.

154
155

A limitation of the study is that the participants were screened after hospital admission and the

156

time of initial colonization could not be confidently determined. However, a recent survey of the

157

Singapore community showed that none out of 305 community dwellers carried CPE in their

158

stools [11]. Therefore, the likelihood that the participants were already colonized by CPE in the

159

community is low. Though our sample size is relatively small, to our knowledge, this study is the

160

most rigorously conducted in terms of frequency of stool sample collection, duration of follow

162

shown to preserve power with modest sample size given more frequent follow-ups [12].

To estimate rates of colonization and duration of carriage, we modeled colonization and carriage
ge

330

dynamics using multi-state Markov models. First, we considered CPE to be a homogeneous
us

331

bacterial group and at any sampling time point patients belonged to one of two states: “non--

332

colonised” or “colonised “. Secondly, we considered CPE by species with patients being “not
ot

333

colonized by any CPE”, “colonized by CP-E. coli”, “colonized by CP-K. pneumoniae” or

334

colonised by “both CP-E. coli and K. pneumoniae”, resulting in a four-state Markov model. In

335

either models, transitions from one state to another was governed by a

We implemented the models in STAN modelling language within the R environment. We used

352

N~(0,1) as prior distributions for parameters estimates, while posterior distributions were

353

sampled using the Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The prior is a generic

354

weakly informative prior as recommended by Rstan which contains enough information to

355

regularize i.e. rule out unreasonable values but is not so narrow as to rule out probable values

356

(Gelman, Github. 2019). Posterior distributions were sampled from 4 chains run over 20,000

357

iterations (including 10,000 burn-in) and we assessed model convergence using the Gelman-

358

Rubin convergence diagnostic statistic and through visualization of trace plots.
