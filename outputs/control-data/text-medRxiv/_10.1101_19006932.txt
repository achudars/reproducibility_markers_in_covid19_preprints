ABSTRACT

2

Here we describe genomic screening of the healthy elderly to identify those resilient to adult-onset genetic

3

disease, despite being at exceptionally high genetic risk. We sequenced 13,131 individuals aged 70 or

4

older (mean age 75 years) from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial.

5

Participants had no prior history of cardiovascular disease, life-threatening cancer, persistent physical

6

disability or dementia. We compared the prevalence of pathogenic variants in medically actionable

7

autosomal dominant disease genes with that from the UK Biobank population, and assessed their clinical

8

impact using personal medical history and adjudicated study outcomes during 4.5 years of follow-up. The

9

frequency of pathogenic variants was less than reported among the younger UK Biobank population,

10

suggesting these variants confer a survival disadvantage during the middle years of life. Yet we identified

11

141 individuals with pathogenic variants free of any associated disease up to average age 79.5 years.

12

Further study of these elderly resilient individuals might help uncover genetic mechanisms that protect

13

against the development of disease.

INTRODUCTION

15

Few genetic studies focus on the healthy elderly (1-6). By contrast, most genetic studies ascertain

16

participants based on clinical presentation and/or family history of genetic disease (7-11). The healthy

17

elderly, especially those who remain unaffected despite carrying genetic risk factors, are uniquely valuable.

18

These resilient individuals may be enriched for protective genetic factors, which if understood, could inform

19

the design of novel preventive or therapeutic strategies (12).

20

Previously, we identified rare exceptional ‘resilience candidates’ with protection against severe Mendelian

21

childhood disorders by analysis of 589,306 genomes (13). Here, we take a new approach to identify

22

individuals resilient to adult-onset genetic disease by direct screening of a healthy elderly cohort (14). As

23

a means of identifying factors that protect against disease in resilient individuals, screening the healthy

24

elderly provides a path to employ statistical approaches for their identification (15). The number of

25

individuals in healthy elderly populations resilient to adult-onset disease is significantly higher than those

26

resilient to childhood-onset disorders, where extremely large numbers need to be screened to identify small

27

numbers of resilient individuals (13).

28

To estimate the rate at which individuals from a healthy elderly population are resilient to adult-onset,

29

autosomal dominant disease, despite carrying pathogenic variants for a lifetime, we sought to screen 13,131

30

healthy elderly individuals enrolled in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial (16-

31

18). We focused on screening for pathogenic variants in dominant genes of high clinical interest, defined

32

as medically actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) (19).

33

Sequencing of participants aged minimum 70 years (mean age 75 years) is accompanied by documented

34

outcome assessment from a clinical trial, to confirm the presence or absence of associated disease.

METHODS

36

STUDY POPULATION

37

All participants were enrolled in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study, a

38

randomized, placebo-controlled trial for daily low-dose aspirin (16-18). Study design (20), recruitment

39

(21), baseline characteristics (22) and results (16-18) have been published previously. Genetic analysis

40

was conducted on 13,131 samples from Australian participants aged 70 years or older at enrolment, free

41

from cardiovascular disease, dementia diagnosis, physical disability, or serious illness likely to cause

42

death within 5 years (ASPREE eligibility criteria in Supplementary Appendix).

43

DNA SEQUENCING AND VARIANT ANALYSIS

44

A custom panel of genes with Mendelian inheritance and disease-association was designed, including 55

45

dominant genes defined as medically actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and

46

Genomics (ACMG) (19). Following standard protocols, DNA was extracted and sequenced using the

47

Thermo Fisher Scientific S5TM XL system, to average 200X depth (see Supplementary Appendix).

48

Variants with ‘pathogenic’ or ‘likely pathogenic’ annotation (23) and/or high-confidence predicted loss-

49

of-function in coding regions (24) were curated following ACMG/AMP Standards and Guidelines for the

50

Interpretation of Sequence Variants (25), including review by laboratory scientists and a clinical geneticist.

51

Analysis was restricted to single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions. Variants of uncertain

52

significance or conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity were excluded.

53

PHENOTYPES AND CLINIAL OUTCOME ASSESSMENT

54

Available disease outcomes from the ASPREE study associated with autosomal dominant genetic

55

conditions are summarized in Table S1. This includes self-reported medical history at enrolment (cancer

56

history by type) and study endpoints collected during mean 4.5 years follow-up (to mean age 79.5 years).

57

Adjudicated secondary endpoints included cancers (by type), cardiovascular events (stroke, coronary

58

heart disease, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure) and all-cause mortality. Coding and

59

adjudication of endpoints has been described previously (16-18).

60

DISEASE ASSOCIATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF RESILIENT CASES

61

We compared the prevalence of pathogenic variants in autosomal dominant genes in ASPREE versus the

62

UK Biobank, a younger population of 49,960 adults aged average 58 years recruited from the UK general

63

population (26). We grouped dominant genes together into related groups, then calculated the relative risk

64

of associated disease per group in ASPREE variant carriers and 12,936 non-carriers in the trial, using

65

personal medical history and prospective diagnoses during follow-up. We identified all pathogenic variant

66

carriers with no evidence of associated disease symptoms to mean age 79.5 years (resilience cases).

PATHOGENIC VARIANTS IN MEDICALLY ACTIONABLE GENES

80

We detected 172 different pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants meeting ACMG/AMP guidelines (25)

81

in 59 genes. Of these, 129 variants were in dominant genes, detected in 176 participants. We validated a

82

representative sample of 10% of these 129 variants by Sanger sequencing (N=14), with 100% concordance.

83

The highest number of pathogenic variants found in any one dominant gene was N=22 (BRCA2 and KCNQ1)

84

We compared the prevalence of pathogenic variants in selected autosomal dominant genes in ASPREE

85

versus the UK Biobank, a younger population of 49,960 adults aged average 58 years (26) (Table 2). We

86

did this to determine if the prevalence of medically actionable variants was depleted in the healthy elderly,

87

compared with a population-based cohort, irrespective of associated disease outcomes or age.

88

Table 2 shows the number of variants detected in both studies across selected gene groups, and the

89

prevalence of pathogenic variants per 1000 individuals (see Table S2 for individual gene frequencies). In

90

ASPREE, pathogenic variants in medically actionable dominant genes were found in 1 in 75 healthy elderly

91

adults (13 per 1000 participants). This was a lower carrier rate to 1 in 50 (20 per 1000) reported in the UK

92

Biobank (26). Some genes had similar frequencies of pathogenic variants between the two studies. Notable

93

differences were the lower prevalence of BRCA2 variants observed in ASPREE, and lower prevalence of

94

female BRCA1/2 carriers (2 per 1000) versus the UK Biobank (4 per 1000).

95

We found no individuals carrying two or more variants in any autosomal recessive gene (homozygotes or

96

compound heterozygotes). However, we found two individuals carrying pathogenic variants in two

97

different dominant genes (PMS2+KCNQ1 and MYBPC3+LDLR respectively).

CLINICAL IMPACT OF PATHOGENIC VARIANTS OVER THE LIFETIME OF PARTICIPANTS

105

We compared the relative risk of associated disease in ASPREE variant carriers versus 12,936 non-

106

carriers in the cohort, to mean age 79.5 years. In almost all cases, we found no statistically significant

107

difference in relative risk of associated disease between pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers,

108

despite detection of pathogenic variants that infer high lifetime disease risk (Table S3). This was due to

109

the high proportion of ASPREE participants who were free of the disease expected to be associated with

110

the pathogenic variant at end of trial (Table S4).

111

The two exceptions were female BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers in ASPREE who were at increased

112

risk of breast cancer versus non-carrier females (P=0.0003) and carriers of pathogenic variants in inherited

113

cardiac disorder genes, who were at increased risk of rapid/sudden cardiac death versus non-carriers

114

(P<0.0001). In the latter group, absolute risk was still low. Among 91 variant carriers, only two sudden

115

cardiac deaths occurred in trial (97.8% associated disease-free). We compared the likelihood of death

116

from any cause between pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers to mean age 79.5 years, and found

117

no statistically significant differences for any genes (Table S5).

118
119

IDENTIFICATION OF RESILIENT INDIVIDUALS

120

To identify resilient individuals in the ASPREE population for medically actionable autosomal dominant

121

genetic conditions, we excluded all pathogenic variant carriers in the cohort who had any symptoms of

122

associated disease to mean age 79.5 years (for conditions where direct clinical phenotypes were available).

123

This identified a total of 141 resilient candidates, who despite carrying pathogenic variants in dominant

124

medically actionable genes, showed no apparent associated disease symptoms to the end of the trial

125

(Table 3).

126

Of these 141 individuals, 22 carried pathogenic variants in genes associated with hereditary breast and

127

ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2), 19 in genes associated with Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous

128

polyposis (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6, APC), 12 in genes associated with familial hypercholesterolemia

129

(LDLR, APOB, PCSK9), and 88 in genes associated with other inherited cardiac disorders or genetic

130

arrythmias (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, MYBPC3, LMNA, MYH11, MYH7, MYL3, TNNT2, GLA, PKP2,

DISCUSSION

148

In the present study, we sequenced the DNA of 13,131 healthy elderly individuals and identified 141

149

apparent resilient carriers of pathogenic variants in genes which typically predispose to autosomal

150

dominant conditions. Despite having a supposedly high genetic risk of disease, these individuals remained

151

apparently unaffected until a mean age of 79.5 years. They were identified among a population of healthy

152

elderly individuals meeting the strict eligibility criteria of the ASPREE trial (22). These elderly surviving

153

pathogenic variant carriers are likely to be enriched for protective genetic factors.

154

There are important differences between resilience to childhood-onset and adult-onset genetic disorders.

155

Many childhood-onset genetic disorders are autosomal recessive and fully penetrant, meaning when a copy

156

of a pathogenic genetic variant is inherited from both parents, it almost always results in severe disease

157

from an early age. Adult-onset conditions, by contrast, tend to be autosomal dominant, with only a single

158

pathogenic variant required to infer risk or predisposition to disease. These conditions tend to occur later

159

in life (25). Such conditions include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (7), Lynch syndrome (9) and

160

familial hypercholesterolemia (27). Most autosomal dominant conditions are not fully penetrant, meaning

161

not all carriers of pathogenic variants develop the associated disease. Thus, a sub-set of pathogenic variant

162

carriers for autosomal dominant conditions will remain unaffected, despite being at high genetic risk (28).

163

These individuals (the lifelong unaffected) are less likely to be recruited in traditional genetic studies that

164

ascertain participants on the basis of family or personal history of disease symptoms.

165

The pathogenic variants identified in this study might prompt medical interventions if detected at younger

166

ages. For example, the risk management of pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants might include risk-reducing

167

bilateral mastectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in younger women. Variants in other cancer-

168

associated genes can also lead to risk-reducing surgeries or long-term high-risk cancer surveillance (29-

169

31). Detection of pathogenic variants in inherited cardiac disorder genes might lead to implantation of

170

automatic defibrillators (32). These interventions have substantial implications for both individuals and

171

the healthcare system.

172

By comparison with the largest available population-based sequencing dataset (the UK Biobank) (26), we

173

found the overall prevalence of pathogenic autosomal dominant variants to be higher (20 per 1000) than

174

in ASPREE (13 per 1000). Differences in sequencing technology, variant curation or ethnic diversity may

175

account for some variation in frequencies of pathogenic variants between the studies. However, the

176

difference is also compatible with a survival disadvantage during the middle years of life.

177

In particular, the frequency of female BRCA1/2 variant carriers in ASPREE was half that reported in the

178

UK Biobank, reflecting a high penetrance of the BRCA1/2 genes. Similarly, lower frequencies of variant

179

carriers for the more penetrant Lynch syndrome genes (MSH6, MLH1, MSH2) was also observed, but not

180

for the less penetrant (PMS2). For other genes, the carrier rate per 1000 was equivalent between ASPREE

and the UK Biobank (e.g. BRCA1, PMS2, MYBPC3, PKP2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD) and for occasional

182

genes the carrier rate in ASPREE was higher (e.g. KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A).

183

Our previous analysis of 589,306 genomes identified 13 rare exceptional ‘resilience candidates’, who

184

despite having mutations that cause severe childhood-onset genetic disease, had no reported clinical

185

symptoms to adulthood (13). Unfortunately, these individuals were identified through data aggregation

186

from several different studies, meaning recontact or follow-up were not possible. Here, individuals have

187

been identified who are resilient to adult-onset genetic disease by direct genomic screening of a healthy

188

elderly cohort, accompanied by documented clinical outcome assessment, and with consent for re-contact

189

(14).

190

The 141 resilience candidates identified now represent a unique sub-cohort for identification of protective

191

genetic factors. Follow-up studies include deeper genomic characterization by whole genome sequencing

192

and genome-wide genotyping, to determine the contribution of rare and common genetic factors towards

193

risk modification (28). Contributions from environmental and lifestyle factors will also be examined

194

through access to detailed longitudinal data collected by the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older

195

Persons (33). Comparisons of ASPREE resilience candidates with other sample cohorts (e.g. case

196

collections of those affected by early-onset disease for the same genes/conditions) are also being planned.

197

A strength of the current study is the detailed phenotyping with ascertainment and adjudication of outcome

198

events during the 4.5 years of follow-up. The age of the cohort (all participants being above the average

199

age of onset for most dominant conditions) has also facilitated the identification of those most likely to

200

be resilient to disease development. Other strengths include the depth of sequencing coverage and

201

stringency of variant curation applied, ensuring all pathogenic variant calls were of high confidence.

202

Our findings provide a scalable approach for more expansive genomic screening of the healthy elderly,

203

to identify those resilient to adult-onset genetic disease. We identified resilience candidates in the healthy

204

elderly at a rate of 1.07% (141 in 13,131 ASPREE participants). Projecting this to a larger sample

205

population of 1 million healthy elderly individuals would estimate identification of over 10,000 resilience

206

candidates. Such a population would provide the foundation for a statistical genetic study, with sufficient

207

sample size to potentially identify protective genetic variants of genome-wide statistical significance (15).

208

Such an approach is currently under consideration, involving both data mining of existing large

209

population-based datasets for the healthy elderly, such as the UK Biobank (26), and direct screening of

210

more community-based biobank cohorts of the healthy elderly, including the Statins in Reducing Events

211

in the Elderly (STAREE), which is currently recruiting (14).

212

Our study also raises a clinically relevant question of whether there is an indicative age at which

213

pathogenic variant carriers for dominant conditions outlive their genetic risk; that is, whether there is an

214

age at which genetic risk and population risk for carriers of autosomal dominant pathogenic variants

converge and become equal. Previous studies suggest the majority of clinical risk attributed to dominant

216

pathogenic variants diminishes by age 70, especially for cancer (7, 9).

217

Limitations of our study include the ASPREE trial not originally being designed to analyse certain

218

dominant genetic disease phenotypes. For example, electrocardiograms were not collected on all

219

participants to detect cardiac abnormalities in pathogenic variant carriers for arrhythmia-related genes.

220

We instead relied on hard study endpoints such as sudden cardiac death to define disease association in

221

those genes. Technical limitations include a sequencing assay that was not capable of detecting pathogenic

222

structural variants, including those in MSH2 and other mismatch repair genes. This, in addition to the

223

strict variant curation and filtering criteria, may have resulted in an under-estimation of pathogenic variant

224

carriers identified. Some pathogenic variant carriers detected in ASPREE may have undergone risk-

225

reducing surgery prior to study enrolment (including hysterectomy, for example, which removes ovarian

226

cancer risk if ovaries are removed), and not reported this to ASPREE in the cancer screening history

227

questionnaire (22). If this occurred in the absence of any cancer diagnosis, it could result in mis-attribution

228

of resilience. Although unlikely, we cannot currently rule out this possibility without re-contacting the 41

229

resilient candidates for cancer-associated genes.

230

In summary, the study demonstrates that a proportion of healthy elderly carry pathogenic variants in

231

medically actionable genes yet remain mostly free of associated disease. This provides a platform for the

232

discovery of protective genetic factors in this uniquely resilient population, and a scalable method for

233

identification of more resilient individuals in the future.
