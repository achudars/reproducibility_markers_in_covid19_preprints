Abstract
Background: The cost and complexity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing
is a significant barrier for the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with
hepatitis C virus (HCV). We investigated the cost-effectiveness of various testing
strategies using antigen as an alternative to PCR.
Methods: We developed a mathematical model for HCV to estimate the number of
newly diagnosed individuals and cases of different stages of liver disease. We
compared the following testing strategies: antibody test followed by PCR in case of
positive antibody (baseline strategy); antibody test followed by HCV-antigen test
(antibody-antigen); antigen test alone; and PCR test alone. We conducted costeffectiveness analyses considering the costs of HCV testing (of both infected and
uninfected individuals) (A1), liver-related complications (A2) and all costs including
HCV treatment (A3). The model was parameterized for the country of Georgia, and
several sensitivity analyses were conducted to generalize the findings for different
settings.
Results: Using the current standard of testing, 89% of infected individuals were
detected. Comparatively, antibody-antigen and antigen testing alone detected 86%
and 88% of infected individuals, respectively. PCR testing alone detected 91% of
the infected individuals with the remaining 9% dying or spontaneously recovering
before testing. In analysis A1, antibody-antigen testing was not found to be
essentially cheaper compared to the baseline strategy. In analysis A2, strategies
using PCR were cheaper than antigen-based strategies. In analysis A3, antibodyantigen testing was the cheapest strategy, followed by the baseline strategy, and
PCR testing alone.
Conclusion: Antigen testing, either following a positive antibody test or alone,
performed almost as well as the current practice of HCV testing. The costeffectiveness of these strategies strongly depends on the inclusion of treatment
costs.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease and liver-related mortality.1-3 The World
Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 71 million people worldwide are
chronically infected with hepatitis C, and almost 400,000 people die from HCV every year,
mostly due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the majority of the HCV infected
individuals are not aware of their infection.4 Simple and effective hepatitis testing strategies and
tools are needed to achieve the WHO target of eliminating HCV as a major public health threat
by 2030.5
Since 2014, Direct Acting Antivirals (DAA) form the standard treatment for HCV. To be
successfully treated with DAA, diagnostic tests are needed to diagnose the infected patients
and confirm the clearance of viral replication 12-24 weeks after the end of treatment.6-8 Two
types of tests are usually used for diagnosing HCV: serological assays that detect antibodies to
HCV, and nucleic acid tests that detect HCV RNA genomes in order to confirm active infection.9
The most commonly used testing protocol is to first use an antibody test, and in the case of a
positive test result, to use a nucleic acid test (most commonly a polymerase chain reaction test,
PCR) to check the presence of the virus.6 The sensitivity and specificity of PCR tests are high.9
PCR testing requires time and trained laboratory personnel, which increases the costs. The cost
of PCR testing is an important barrier in implementing comprehensive testing, especially in lowand middle-income countries.
HCV antigen testing is a serological assay that directly detects a viral protein and can give a
positive test result as soon as the virus component is present. This test can be done on the
same platform as the antibody test.8 Antigen testing is cheaper10 and requires less special
training than PCR testing. While antigen tests have a specificity of up to 100%, viral loads below
3000 IU/ml may not be detected.7,11-13

With a limited budget, replacing PCR by antigen testing could increase testing coverage, but
people with very low viral loads may be missed. Using the country of Georgia as an example, we
aimed to study the cost-effectiveness of different testing strategies using a mathematical model.

Materials and methods
Model structure and inputs
We developed a mathematical model for HCV disease progression, similar to a previously
published model.14 We simulated cohorts of patients who were followed from the time of
infection until death. The progression of HCV is represented by a directed acyclic graph of
health states. In each state, the model samples transition times to all possible destination states.
The minimum of these times determines when and to which state the patient will move next. The
process is repeated until the patient reaches a terminal state (death). The patients progress
along two dimensions: progression of liver disease, and course of the HCV infection including
cascade of care (Figure 1). The condition of liver disease is represented by the METAVIR
scoring system (F0 to F4), followed by decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) and liver transplantation (LT). Death is represented using separate states depending on
the cause of death: liver-related death, HIV-related death, drug use related death, and death due
to other causes. At the beginning of the simulation, patients are assigned the following
characteristics: age at infection, year of birth, gender, HIV co-infection, level of alcohol
consumption, and duration of intravenous drug use (IDU).
Many studies have shown that hepatitis C viral load is relatively stable in untreated patients with
chronic infection.9,15-16 We therefore assumed that viral load remains approximately constant in
untreated individuals. We used the distribution of hepatitis C viral load among patients in the
Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS) database11 and assigned each patient a baseline viral
load. Viral load values at the time of HCV testing were sampled from a log-normal distribution

around the baseline viral load. We denote viral loads below 3000 IU/ml as very low viral loads
(VLVL). 7,11-12
We considered the following strategies of testing: HCV-antibody followed by PCR testing in case
of a positive antibody test (baseline strategy); HCV-antibody followed by HCV-antigen testing in
case of a positive antibody test; HCV-antigen test alone; and PCR test alone. In all strategies, a
second test (either PCR or antigen, whichever was used for confirming the diagnosis) was taken
12 weeks after completion of treatment to confirm sustained virologic response (SVR). We
assumed that all individuals were tested for HCV once during the years 2015 to 2018. In case of
a negative test result, the individual was not retested.
The probability of HCV detection depends on the rate of HCV testing and the sensitivity of the
test. We assumed that the probability of HCV detection by antibody test increases
exponentially during the first year of the infection and stabilizes at 99% thereafter. The
sensitivity of the antigen test was assumed to be 98.2% for patients with a viral load above
3000 IU/ml, and 33.0% for patients with VLVL.11 The PCR test was assumed to be 100%
sensitive. As our model only simulates infected patients, the expected numbers of tests among
HCV uninfected people were calculated from the estimated HCV prevalence in the target
population. We assumed 100% specificity for HCV-antigen and PCR tests.
We assumed that all detected patients are treated with DAAs, and 98% of the treated patients
achieve SVR6. The parameters related to liver disease progression are shown in
Supplementary Table 1. We assumed that HCV viral load was not independently associated
with fibrosis progression rates.2, 17
We parameterized the model to represent the epidemic in the country of Georgia. Georgia was
among the first countries that aimed to eliminate HCV and started an HCV elimination program18
in April 2015. Enlarged-scale HCV screening began already in January 2015, before the launch
of the program. Screening services continue to be provided in various settings free of charge.
As of June 30, 2018, a total of 1,175,291 HCV screening tests had been done and 1,125,808
persons registered in the elimination program, of whom 93,181 (8.3%) were positive for HCV

antibody. Among persons receiving HCV testing, most were screened during inpatient
hospitalization (44%); other groups of persons receiving HCV screening included blood donors
(18%), and pregnant women (9%).19 The current laboratory testing process in Georgia is as
follows: patients with unknown or no documented HCV serological status first undergo anti-HCV
antibody testing by rapid or laboratory-based methods (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay [ELISA] or chemiluminescent immunoassay [CIA]). Patients with documented HCV
serological status and positive anti-HCV antibodies undergo testing to determine active HCV
infection by PCR, or since December 2017 alternatively with core antigen testing.20

We

assumed that HCV prevalence was 66.2% among IDUs and 5.4% among the rest of the
population.21-22 IDUs represented 25% of the simulated cohort.19 Table 1 and Supplementary
Figures 1-2 present the detailed baseline characteristics of the simulated individuals. The
simulated population included only patients who were infected before the year 2019, and who
had not cleared the virus spontaneously or been treated before 2015. We only considered the
infected individuals who were not diagnosed by the year 2015.

Model outcomes
We estimated the number of diagnoses for each testing strategy and compared the number of
people who experienced severe liver disease (F3), cirrhosis (F4), DC, HCC, and liver-related
death within their lifetime.
We also conducted cost-effectiveness analyses comparing the different testing alternatives.
We conducted three analyses with different assumptions regarding costs. In Analysis A1, we
only considered the direct costs of the HCV tests (diagnosis and treatment monitoring),
including also HCV uninfected individuals who were not explicitly simulated. In Analysis A2,
we included in addition other laboratory costs during treatment (including clinical assessment,
complete blood count, HCV-associated consultations, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
test)20 as well as the lifetime costs associated with liver disease. This analysis takes the
perspective of the health care payer in situations like in the country of Georgia where

treatment costs are covered by external donors. In Analysis A3, we included all costs of
HCV testing, liver disease and HCV treatment. We reviewed the literature and contacted
persons directly involved in the elimination project in the country of Georgia who helped to
interpret already published data to obtain costs related to HCV testing, DAA treatment and
liver disease, as well as HCV- and liver-related utilities (Table 2).21-24 As studies reporting
average costs related to liver disease are scarce, we decided to adopt the life-time costs from
Turkey for viremic individuals, and modified the costs in a sensitivity analysis.23 We assumed
that the costs of liver disease in stages F0 to F3 decreased by 50% after achieving SVR. In all
analyses, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between the
strategies, comparing the incremental costs with incremental gain in quality-adjusted life
expectancy at time of infection.
The results are presented per infected individual. We discounted all future costs and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) at 3% per year.

Sensitivity analyses
In order to address the uncertainty around key parameters and generalize our findings to other
settings, we conducted several sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table 2). First, we modified
the costs of tests by reducing the unit cost of either the PCR test (sensitivity analysis S1) or the
antigen test (sensitivity analysis S2). Second, we reduced the liver-related costs after SVR to
zero for liver stages F0-F2 (sensitivity analysis S3). Third, we used an alternative estimate of
costs for liver diseases from France (sensitivity analysis S4). Finally, we calculated the results
for a population consisting completely of non-IDUs with decreased HCV prevalence (sensitivity
analysis S5), or an IDU population with an increased HCV prevalence (sensitivity analysis S6).
Results
In the baseline scenario, 89,400 persons out of 100,000 infected individuals were diagnosed
during the four-year screening period. In the strategy with antibody followed by antigen testing,
fewer infected individuals were detected (86,100 persons per 100,000 infected individuals). For

antigen test alone the number of diagnoses was 87,500 persons per 100,000 infected
individuals. PCR test alone could detect the highest number of infected individuals (91,000
persons): the remaining 9% of infected individuals either died or spontaneously recovered
before testing.
The proportion of patients who experienced severe liver disease was highest for antibody
testing followed by antigen testing, and lowest for PCR testing alone (Figure 2). In the baseline
strategy, 22.5% of infected individuals experienced at least liver disease stage F3 in their life.
The percentages of people who experienced at least liver disease stage F3 were 23.5%,
22.9%, and 21.7% for antibody followed by antigen test, antigen test alone, and PCR test
alone, respectively. The percentages of people who reached stage F4 ranged between 10.0%
and 12.0% across all strategies. For DC, HCC, LT and liver-related death the corresponding
ranges were 2.2%-3.0%, 1.4%-2.1%, 0.5%-0.6% and 3.7%-5.0%, respectively.
Figure 3A presents the cost versus QALY for Analysis A1, considering only the cost of testing.
Antibody followed by antigen testing was the cheapest strategy with a total cost of $215 per
infected individual a mean quality-adjusted life expectancy of 15.51 QALYs. The most costeffective strategy compared with antibody followed by antigen was the baseline strategy, with a
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 15.56 QALYs and an ICER of $369/QALY gained. Antigen
alone had higher costs than the baseline strategy. PCR alone, which had a mean qualityadjusted life expectancy of 15.60 QALYs, was the most effective strategy with an ICER of
$10,763/QALY gained compared with the baseline strategy.
Life-time liver disease costs including the cost of laboratory testing and treatment monitoring
(Analysis A2) are presented in Figure 3B. In this analysis, the baseline scenario was the
cheapest scenario with a life-time cost of $6,275. PCR test alone, the only strategy performing
better than the baseline, had an ICER of $9,281/QALY gained compared with the baseline
scenario.
In Analysis A3 considering all costs of testing, liver disease and treatment, antibody followed by
antigen was again the cheapest scenario, with an average life-time cost of $44,340 (Figure

3C). Compared with antibody followed by antigen testing, the baseline strategy was the most
cost-effective strategy with an ICER of $26,363/QALY gained. Compared with the baseline, the
ICER of PCR testing alone was $26,643/QALY gained.

Sensitivity analyses
Changing the input costs of diagnostic tests or liver disease did not change the patterns of
cost-effectiveness substantially (Supplementary Figures 3-6). The largest differences were in
the analyses of the low- and high-prevalence populations. In the case of a low-prevalence nonIDU population, the results of all three analyses were driven by the costs of testing the negative
individuals. Replacing the two-step testing (i.e. antibody test followed by PCR or antigen test)
with antigen alone increased the costs of testing (analysis A1) by $2,000 per infected
individual; for PCR alone costs increased by $4,000 per infected individual (Supplementary
Figure 7). In the high HCV prevalence IDU population, the situation was reversed
(Supplementary Figure 8). Considering the costs of testing only (analysis A1), antigen and
PCR testing alone were slightly cheaper than their corresponding two-step procedures. If costs
of liver disease were also included (analysis A2), PCR testing alone was even the cheapest
strategy. Considering all costs (analysis A3), antibody followed by antigen was again the
cheapest scenario. Of the remaining strategies, antigen testing alone was the most costeffective strategy with an ICER of $12,265/QALY gained compared to the cheapest strategy.
Discussion
Principal findings
Strategies using an antigen test to diagnose HCV infection performed reasonably well
compared with the traditional PCR based approach, but the cost-effectiveness of these
strategies depends on the perspective taken. In situations like in the country of Georgia, where
treatment is provided from external sources20, the current two-step testing procedure using

antibody and PCR tests has the lowest costs from the healthcare system’s point of view. When
we added the HCV treatment costs to our analysis, the two-step procedure with antigen instead
of PCR as the confirmatory test was the cheapest, but also the least effective, strategy. The
maximum difference in quality-adjusted life expectancy across all strategies was however only
one month. Antigen testing alone performed better than antibody followed by antigen, but not as
well as the baseline strategy. PCR testing alone was clearly the most effective but also most
expensive strategy. These additional costs could however be compensated by cost savings
related to liver disease, if we did not consider the costs of HCV treatment.
Antigen testing alone has been considered a potential alternative for the current two-step testing
procedure, which requires the patient to visit the clinic multiple times. Both strategies miss some
HCV infected individuals. According to our study, antigen alone missed about 3% and the
baseline strategy 2% of those infected. The characteristics of the missed patients are however
different. The HCV antibody test can detect a positive result only about 35 days after infection25,
and strategies using antibody tests as the initial test, such as the baseline strategy, may lead to
possible under-diagnosis in populations with ongoing transmission. However, the Georgian HCV
epidemic can be characterized as an “old epidemic”: most HCV infections were acquired during
the first years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.26 Also, in immunosuppressed patients, the
antibody test may always be negative.27 The antigen test in turn misses around two thirds of
individuals with VLVL. Antigen testing was less beneficial than the baseline strategy for two
reasons: the number of VLVL patients was higher in patients with chronic infection than in
recently infected patients, and VLVL patients, as chronically infected persons, reach end-stage
liver disease on average earlier than those recently infected. Antigen testing saved costs mainly
by missing the VLVL infected individuals and therefore reducing the number of treated patients.
However, spontaneous cure is frequent among VLVL individuals, as compared to chronically
infected patients11. Moreover, if low viral load values would slow down the progression of liver
disease, antigen might no longer be inferior to the baseline. The probability of onward HCV
transmission may also be clearly lower in persons with VLVL.28 Using a one-step simple test

could have other advantages, such as reducing the risk of loss to follow-up (LTFU). In Georgia,
more than 25% of anti-HCV positive individuals did not get a confirmatory test and were
considered LTFU in 2015.18 Using a one-step simple test would also reduce the unnecessary
anxiety among individuals with a false positive result or with spontaneous cure.
Although PCR testing is more expensive than antigen testing, our analysis revealed some
situations where the total costs may be lower with PCR based strategies. If the costs of
treatment are not considered, the costs saved by preventing progression to advanced liver
disease in a few patients could outnumber the additional costs needed for testing by PCR, either
according to the current practice, or even by using PCR alone. In addition to the country of
Georgia, where treatment is covered by external sources, this may also be relevant for other
countries that have negotiated special agreements with treatment manufacturers. In the
“subscription model”29,30, where the government pays a flat fee for treating all infected residents
within a given time period, the costs of treatment do not depend on the number of treated
patients, and the cost-effectiveness evaluations should thus focus on the costs of liver disease
and diagnostics. PCR testing alone was used in our analysis as a theoretical best-case
comparator: testing the population with this test costing more than $40 is unlikely. However, in a
setting with extremely high prevalence and ongoing transmission, such as active IDU, PCR
testing alone could be cost-saving.
In a setting with a limited health budget, investments in less expensive tests can free
resources to test and treat more infected individuals. When comparing the current practice to
the less expensive strategy using antibody followed by antigen testing, the ICER was about
$19,600 per QALY if all costs including treatment were included, and the high costs were
mainly caused by the increased need of treatment. This shows that in higher-income
countries, the use of PCR as the confirmatory test can be justified from the financial point of
view. However, in low-income settings, it may not be efficient to invest in PCR tests, in
particular if those with low viral loads have a lower rate of HCV transmission and high
probability of spontaneously recovery. The formal cost-effectiveness analysis also does not

take into account other factors such as budget restrictions. If only a fixed budget is available
for testing within a given time period, the use of less expensive tests allows to test more
individuals, thus leading to more diagnoses and better clinical outcomes. Under some
conditions, the use of antigen as a confirmatory test may thus be a beneficial solution.

Strengths and limitations
Several studies have compared antigen and PCR testing in different settings and proposed the
use of antigen testing.24,31,33-34 These studies were however usually limited to compare the costs
of the diagnosis, or other short-term costs, alone. Our study compares different HCV testing
strategies on the life-time burden of HCV infection in a nationwide setting.
Our study is subject to limitations. First, HCV transmission was not included. We ignored the
additional burden of the disease and costs that each missed case might cause due to onward
transmission of HCV. A massive scale-up of therapy may reduce the number of new infections.
Second, we did not consider HCV reinfection after achieving SVR. Reinfection has been might
reduce the overall difference in QALYs as well as increase the overall costs. Third, we did not
model any extrahepatic manifestations (EHM) explicitly. EHM could increase the overall lifetime costs associated with HCV.35 Including the costs of EHM could further favor the more
effective strategies. Fourth, we did not allow for HCV re-testing. Individuals who identify
themselves at high risk of infection, such as active IDUs, are recommended to get retested at
least once a year.6 This is also the population with most acute infections. As antibody testing
misses those recently infected, our model may overestimate the benefit of strategies with
antibody testing for populations with a high number of acute infections. Fifth, we did not take
into account some factors that could favor the use of antigen testing, such as the possibly
slower progression, lower risk of onward transmission and higher rate of spontaneous cure
among patients with VLVL, the potentially better retention of one-step testing strategies, and
potential reductions of the cost of antigen testing. Sixth, our analyses took the perspective of a
health care payer. Although in the Georgian elimination program all costs are now paid from

the governmental expenditure, in other settings where a considerable part of the costs is
covered with out-of-pocket payments the question of finding the most cost-effective strategy
becomes more complicated.

Conclusions
A single antigen test can be a reliable and practical alternative for the current two-step
procedure to diagnose HCV infection, but the cost-effectiveness of this strategy depends on
various factors. In settings where the costs of treatment do not directly depend on the number
of treated patients, the higher costs of PCR testing are likely to be compensated by the
savings in liver disease related costs. However, a full consideration of treatment related costs
may favor simpler and easier tests such as antigen alone, or antigen after antibody testing.
The change to a simple one-time test could offer several advantages, and the vast majority of
individuals chronically infected with HCV have viral loads above 3000 IU/ml, a level at which
the diagnostic capacity of antigen tests does not differ from PCR. The policy-makers should
therefore carefully review the situation in each country to decide the optimal strategy of
diagnosing HCV infection.
