INTRODUCTION

25

Typhoid fever (typhoid) is an enteric bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi

26

(Salmonella Typhi; S. Typhi). It is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in

27

the developing world,[1] with an estimated 10.9 million new cases worldwide and 116.8 thousand

28

deaths in 2017.[2,3] Paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi A, B and C

29

(S. Paratyphi) results in a disease that can have an identical clinical syndrome to typhoid fever,[4] but

30

is often less severe.[5] Typhoid fever is most common in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with

31

children predominantly affected. Like many febrile illnesses, typhoid presents with non-specific

32

symptoms and signs, especially in its early stages. In routine healthcare settings in low- and middle-

33

income countries (LMIC), typhoid fever is commonly suspected and treated empirically with

34

antibiotics.[6] This overuse of antibiotics creates a selective pressure for the development of

35

antimicrobial resistance (AMR),[7] that has resulted in the emergence and spread of typhoid strains

36

that are resistant to all first-line antibiotics.[8] Similarly, the low specificity of current rapid

37

diagnostic tests (RDTs) can lead to an over diagnosis of typhoid fever that may result in the overuse

38

of antibiotics and delay the proper treatment for underlying conditions. For example, the use of the

39

Widal test during an outbreak of acute febrile illness in Nepal led to misdiagnosis of typhoid which

40

delayed the appropriate treatment of the causative agent (scrub typhus), resulting in dozens of

41

deaths.[9] The potential harms of current typhoid RDTs are compounded by the fact they are widely

42

available, cheap and easy to use.[10]

43
44

Various aspects of S. Typhi biology make diagnosis by standard laboratory methods challenging. S.

45

Typhi is able to bypass the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier that restricts other enteric bacteria and can

46

evade the typical innate immune responses with limited activation of inflammatory pathways.[11] S.

47

Typhi infection begins with invasion of the mucosa of the terminal ileum, and the organism is thought

48

to only be transiently present in the blood before dissemination throughout the reticuloendothelial

49

system into the bone marrow, liver and spleen.[12] The bacterial load in peripheral blood peaks in the

50

first week of illness,[13] but is still very low with a median of 0.1-1.0 colony forming units (CFU)/mL

51

in symptomatic patients.[14] This concentration is difficult to detect by blood culture or PCR,

52

resulting in lower sensitivity for these diagnostic tests. S. Typhi is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae

53

family, and antibodies that have been produced in response to prior infections with other

54

Enterobacteriaceae tend to cross-react with S. Typhi,[12] due to significant conservation of surface

55

antigens. This cross-reactivity lowers the specificity of antibody-based diagnostic assays that

56

otherwise are well suited for a simple, rapid and inexpensive test format. Compounding the challenge,

57

the muted immune response that occurs through expression of the Vi capsular polysaccharide[12] may

58

further hinder the utility of serological tests for typhoid diagnosis.

60

In clinical settings supported by a microbiology laboratory, invasive typhoid infection is confirmed

61

through isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures, but this is relatively expensive, can take >48 hours,

62

has low sensitivity, and requires laboratory infrastructure and trained staff that are not commonly

63

available in LMIC where typhoid is most prevalent.[15] Bone marrow cultures have high sensitivity

64

for detection of S. Typhi but are not routinely used because of the invasive techniques needed to

65

obtain bone marrow aspirates. PCR testing for typhoid is expensive and has a low diagnostic

66

sensitivity when used on peripheral blood samples.[16] Other available point-of-care (POC)

67

diagnostic tests include the Widal test,[17] TUBEX,[18] Typhidot,[19] Test-it Typhoid,[20] and the

68

Typhoid-Paratyphoid diagnostic assay (TPTest). However, these tests all have significant drawbacks

69

that limit their clinical use.

70
71

A Cochrane review of the accuracy of the commercially available antibody-based rapid RDTs showed

72

moderate sensitivity and specificity for the TUBEX colorimetric test that detects anti-O:9 antibody

73

titres (78%, 87%), the Typhidot dot enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that measures IgG

74

and IgM antibodies against the outer membrane proteins of S. Typhi (84%, 79%) and the Test-it

75

Typhoid immunochromatographic lateral flow assay that detects IgM antibodies against S. Typhi O

76

antigen (69%, 90%).[21] The TPTest is a newer serological test that detects circulating IgA using

77

ELISA with a sensitivity and specificity of >95%.[22] But it takes 24-48 hrs hours to produce a result,

78

and requires blood culture equipment not widely available in resource-limited settings.[14,22] Due to

79

the limited sensitivity of all current typhoid POC tests they cannot be relied upon to guide treatment

80

prescribing.

81
82

If developed and implemented effectively, an accurate typhoid RDT could reduce morbidity and

83

mortality through faster diagnosis. Further, it could help to reduce the overuse of antibiotics that

84

contributes to the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant strains of S. Typhi and other bacteria.

85

In recent years, novel approaches have been described to develop typhoid diagnostic tests with

86

improved accuracy in resource-limited settings, including serological, molecular, metabolomic,

87

proteomic, and transcriptomic methods.[7] For example, a recent study has shown that IgA and IgM

88

against S. Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may be a specific marker of acute typhoid infection and is

89

a promising target for diagnostic test development.[23]

90
91

As the need for appropriate fever case management becomes more apparent,[24] the need for

92

improved typhoid diagnostics suitable for use in low-resource environments becomes more pressing.

93

Building on the recent momentum around improved typhoid surveillance[25] and advances in typhoid

94

detection,[1] this report describes the development of a target product profile (TPP) in an attempt to

95

define the diagnostic needs for this important pathogen. The TPP is intended to guide product

96

development and to ensure an optimized solution that meets the needs of endemic countries and

97

results in tangible improvements in patient management. In addition, the TPP aims to re-invigorate

98

the discussion of diagnostics as a crucial part of the global typhoid agenda. This report focuses on the

99

process of TPP development with an emphasis on key test characteristics and discussion points

100

identified by typhoid experts and experienced stakeholders.

102

METHODS

103

Data gathering

104

A structured review of relevant literature related to Salmonella Typhi diagnosis was performed to

105

develop a draft TPP with minimal and optimal desired characteristics for a next-generation typhoid

106

diagnostic test. The test characteristics chosen for the TPP were selected based on previous TPPs

107

published by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND)[26,27], and include the scope,

108

target population, intended use, expected test performance, as well as operational and financial

109

parameters (Table 1). Each desired test characteristic was classified as either a minimum requirement

110

that a test must meet to be useful for healthcare providers treating patients in resource-limited settings,

111

or an optimum threshold that would make the test highly desirable for both healthcare providers and

112

patients. The Ovid Medline database was accessed on June 21, 2018 using the Medical Subject

113

Heading (MeSH) “Typhoid fever” and the subheading “Diagnosis”. Results were restricted to English

114

language articles published in the previous 10 years. Titles and abstracts of retrieved articles were

115

scanned for relevance, with articles of interest thoroughly reviewed by RM for content relevant to the

116

TPP. Additional documents were identified by searching for “typhoid” on the websites of the

117

Cochrane library, WHO, and FIND, and by screening references and studies that cited articles

118

selected in the initial search. Expert stakeholders to be contacted for the Delphi survey were identified

119

as part of the literature review.

120
121

Delphi survey

122

Stakeholders were contacted for input on the draft TPP using a Delphi survey. Stakeholders included

123

specialists in clinical medicine (n = 14), laboratory medicine (n = 2), microbiology (n = 6),

124

diagnostics (n = 11) and public health and global health. An online survey (supplementary table 1)

125

was used and respondents were asked to rate their agreement with each of the TPP characteristics

126

using a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = mostly

127

agree, 5 = fully agree). A consensus agreement was defined as ≥75% of respondents who either

128

mostly or fully agreed with a TPP characteristic. Results from the first round of the survey (Oct/2018)

129

were used to refine the TPP, and a second draft of the TPP was distributed (Nov/2018) to all initial

130

participants as well as two additional stakeholders identified after the first round of the survey was

131

completed.

RESULTS

142

An Ovid Medline search using the MeSH “Typhoid fever” produced 10,698 results, with 1,558 results

143

for the subheading “Diagnosis”. Limiting search results to English language articles published after

144

January 1st, 2008, provided 298 articles that were screened for relevance. Additional documents were

145

included as outlined in the Methods and selected articles were thoroughly reviewed to develop a draft

146

typhoid TPP with minimum and optimum criteria for the test characteristics in Table 1.

147
148

Feedback on the draft TPP was obtained from key stakeholders through the first round of the Delphi

149

survey, with 40 stakeholders contacted and 19 (19/40, 48%) completed surveys received. Survey

150

respondents had experience working in low resource settings in Africa, the Americas, Europe, the

151

Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific region. Consensus agreement of

152

≥75% was achieved for 34/36 (94%) TPP criteria. TPP criteria that generated the most discussion in

153

the Delphi survey were related to the scope of the test including the goal, target population, level of

154

the health care system, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, as well as cost. Based on feedback from

155

survey respondents, “multiplexing” was removed as a TPP characteristic, and the remaining minimum

156

and optimum TPP criteria were revised. For criteria that had achieved consensus agreement, revisions

157

were made if survey respondents provided compelling suggestions for improvement.

158
159

A second draft of the TPP was distributed to the 19 people who responded to the initial Delphi survey,

160

and two additional stakeholders identified after completion of the first round. A total of 12 completed

161

surveys were received from 13 stakeholders, including two who submitted a joint survey, with

162

consensus agreement achieved for 33/35 (94%) TPP characteristics. The two criteria that did not meet

163

the consensus threshold were the target level of the health system and diagnostic sensitivity, both of

164

which received 67% agreement. Survey respondent feedback was used to revise these two criteria,

165

and to make minor changes to four criteria that had ≥75% agreement, before inclusion in the final

166

version of the TPP presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4.

167
168

Scope of test

169

Delphi survey feedback emphasized that a next-generation RDT for typhoid fever should not focus

170

solely on the diagnosis of S. Typhi. To reduce the empiric use of antibiotics that generates selective

171

pressure for AMR, a typhoid RDT would ideally be combined with diagnostics for malaria and other

172

causes of acute febrile illness as part of a case management algorithm (Table 2). Due to the similar

173

clinical presentation and the changing epidemiology of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi, survey respondents

174

advised that a next-generation test for typhoid fever should be able to detect both S. Typhi and S.

175

Paratyphi.

176

The target population was identified based on published data from Africa and Asia.[25,28] Children

177

aged two to 14 years bear the brunt of the global typhoid burden but there is substantial variability

178

both within and between regions in terms of who is most affected. A recent study from Pakistan found

179

higher rates of typhoid fever in adults than in children.[28] These data highlight the need for a typhoid

180

RDT that can detect the disease in individuals of all ages, as confirmed by the Delphi survey.

181
182

When designing new diagnostic tests, the level of the healthcare system where a test will be deployed

183

is an important consideration. Ghani, et al., have identified five healthcare system levels, with

184

different types of diagnostic or prognostic tools suitable for different levels.[29] Typhoid is most

185

prevalent in LMIC with limited healthcare resources, and in these contexts the optimal typhoid test

186

would not require sophisticated equipment and could be easily interpreted by non-laboratory

187

personnel.[6,7] Respondents agreed that a test would optimally be usable at the lowest level of a

188

healthcare system, which in many cases is a community health worker seeing patients in an informal

189

environment. However, as the current gold standard of blood culture requires laboratory equipment,

190

but has suboptimal sensitivity and specificity, some respondents felt it was acceptable for a typhoid

191

RDT to require basic laboratory facilities, with a trained laboratory technician, providing it meets all

192

other TPP criteria. Based on feedback from the initial round of the Delphi survey the minimum target

193

level was adjusted upward to a higher level of the health care system, but consensus agreement was

194

not achieved as some respondents felt strongly that the minimum requirement should be a test that can

195

be used in informal settings at the lowest level of the healthcare system.

Test performance

201

Blood culture is commonly used as the reference standard for typhoid diagnosis but requires

202

sophisticated equipment not readily available in LMIC where typhoid is endemic.[6] Typhoid blood

203

cultures require a minimum of two to 10 mL of venous blood due to the low bacterial load in

204

peripheral blood, and have poor sensitivity estimated at only 61% in a recent systematic review.[31]

205

The most commonly used typhoid POC tests (Widal, Typhidot, Tubex, Test-It Typhoid, TPTest)

206

require between 5 µL and 1 mL of blood, but have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.[21]

207

Survey respondents agreed that an optimal next-generation typhoid RDT would use a capillary blood

208

sample with a volume of ≤100 µL, or a less invasive sample type, excluding urine and stool[12,26].

209

However, survey respondents indicated that ≤1 mL of venous blood was an acceptable minimum

210

requirement due to the current difficulty in accurately diagnosing typhoid fever (Table 3). The TPP

211

allows for up to two sample processing steps as an RDT may require serum to be separated from

212

whole blood, with at most five steps for the test of which no more than two should be timed,[26] and a

213

total hands on time of less than five minutes. Based on a published expert consensus TPP for

214

diagnostics for acute febrile illness, RDT performance ideally would entail three or fewer steps, of

215

which at most one step is timed, with a total hands-on time of one minute or less.[26]

216
217

For a new typhoid diagnostic test to have the greatest impact on prescribing and clinical outcomes it

218

would need to yields results in less than a few hours.[32] There was consensus agreement that the

219

optimum requirement would make results available within 15 minutes to coincide with the average

220

development time of other point-of-care diagnostics commonly used in LMIC environments (for

221

example, malaria antigen-detecting RDTs). A minimum requirement of results within two hours was

222

agreed; this would be a significant improvement from the ≥48 hours required for blood culture, and

223

two hours was deemed the longest time that outpatients could wait for test results, particularly in rural

224

settings where patients may have to travel long distances to reach a health facility.[26]

230

Researchers have proposed that an ideal typhoid diagnostic test would have a simple positive/negative

231

read-out similar to a home pregnancy test,[6] with results easily interpretable by non-laboratory

232

personnel.[7] The typhoid TPP therefore requires a binary read-out of results, with data that either do

233

not require interpretation, or that are easily interpretable. No specific analyte or limit of detection is

234

specified for the typhoid TPP, with any analyte or combination of analytes acceptable providing the

235

test meets all other TPP requirements.

236
237

The minimum TPP requirement for diagnostic sensitivity is ≥90%, with an optimum sensitivity of

238

≥95%, based on modelling data and expert opinion.[21,35–38] Consensus agreement in the Delphi

239

survey was not achieved for test sensitivity, which reflects the substantial variation in published

240

expert opinions regarding the desirable accuracy for a typhoid RDT. However, survey respondents did

241

agree on a minimum specificity of 95% and an optimum specificity of 98%.

242
243

Operational characteristics

244

Survey respondents agreed on operational characteristics of the typhoid TPP (Table 4). Typhoid

245

diagnostic test kits ideally should consist of individually packaged tests with individual reagents (if

246

required) and a user manual in local languages, based on TPP characteristics for other POC tests in

247

regions where typhoid is endemic.[26,40,41] Up to one reagent preparation step is acceptable, to

248

allow for reconstitution of a powdered reagent. The test should not require a cold chain, with

249

operating conditions that reflect the high temperatures and humidity that are present in many regions

250

in Africa and Asia where typhoid is prevalent.

Currently most typhoid treatments are provided in outpatient settings, including informal medical

255

shops, so an ideal POC test would not require any sophisticated equipment or a formal laboratory

256

infrastructure.[7] A small, portable or handheld battery-operated instrument is acceptable,[44] but

257

ideally no equipment would be required. To be truly transformative, a typhoid POC test needs to be

258

useable in settings without a reliable power or water supply. If power is required, then it should be

259

provided by a combination of rechargeable batteries and solar power.

260
261

Empiric treatment of suspected typhoid cases is common, typically using relatively inexpensive

262

antibiotics.[7] To reduce the overuse of empiric antibiotics, the end-user cost for a typhoid POC test

263

was set at <$3.00 USD (minimum requirement) or <$1.00 USD (optimum requirement) to reflect the

264

cost of empiric antibiotics in endemic regions.[7] Delphi survey feedback indicated that the highest

265

cost to the end-user in Africa should be equivalent to one US dollar.

DISCUSSION

268

Typhoid diagnostic tests currently lack the sensitivity and specificity required for an accurate

269

diagnosis at the point of care, resulting in the overuse of antibiotics through empiric treatment. The

270

WHO has developed a list of characteristics that make a test suitable for the resource-limited settings

271

where typhoid is prevalent: the ASSURED acronym stands for affordable, sensitive, specific, user-

272

friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and delivered to those in need.[44] TPPs build upon these

273

criteria and increasingly are used in the global health community to guide development of diagnostic

274

tests and to inform donors about global health priorities.[26,40,41] This TPP outlines the minimum

275

and optimum desired characteristics for an improved typhoid RDT and is intended to accelerate

276

development of optimized diagnostics that meet the needs of users in endemic regions.

277
278

Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to typhoid treatment, with strains of S. Typhi that are resistant

279

to three first-line agents now prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa.[8] The emergence of multi-drug

280

resistant strains that have acquired additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generation

281

cephalosporins, known as extremely drug resistant S. Typhi, has left azithromycin and the costly

282

intravenous carbapenem drugs as the only antibiotic options for some patients.[8] There have been

283

sporadic case reports of azithromycin-resistant S. Typhi,[8] but if extremely drug resistant strains

284

acquire azithromycin resistance, carbapenems could be left as the only effective treatment. To prevent

285

the further spread of resistant S. Typhi it would be beneficial to conduct drug susceptibility testing for

286

individual patients before commencing antibiotic therapy. Drug susceptibility testing was not included

287

as a TPP requirement because it is not likely to be feasible in non-culture POC tests due to the

288

evolving nature of typhoid resistance[8] and may make interpretation of test results too complex for

289

users at the lowest healthcare level[29]. However, some Delphi survey respondents felt that for an

290

RDT ever to replace blood culture it must include susceptibility testing. An RDT for diagnosis

291

combined with epidemiological knowledge of the antibiotic sensitivity of strains, updated at intervals,

292

could be a compromise solution.

293
294

The 2017 Global Burden of Disease study estimated that S. Paratyphi affected 3.4 million people

295

annually, with 19.1 thousand deaths, compared to 10.9 million cases and 116.8 thousand deaths for S.

296

Typhi.[2,3] The higher morbidity and mortality of S. Typhi makes it a greater public health concern,

297

but the increasing prevalence of S. Paratyphi in certain regions makes it prudent for a next-generation

298

test to detect S. Paratyphi as well as S. Typhi.[5,30,45] Delphi survey feedback noted that not being

299

able to detect S. Paratyphi could undermine clinician confidence in a next-generation typhoid POC

300

test as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi may cause indistinguishable clinical syndromes.[4] As drug-resistant

301

typhoid continues to spread, it may become necessary to differentiate between these two serovars

302

prior to starting therapy due to different antibiotic susceptibility profiles.[46]

304

The minimum diagnostic requirement for a typhoid RDT in this TPP was ≥90% sensitivity and ≥95%

305

specificity, with an optimum threshold of ≥95% sensitivity and ≥98% specificity. Consensus

306

agreement was achieved in the Delphi survey for specificity but not sensitivity, reflecting the

307

substantial variability seen in the published literature with proposed targets ranging from 80-90% for

308

sensitivity and 90-98% for specificity.[21,36,37] The poor sensitivity of blood culture as a reference

309

standard for typhoid diagnosis makes it difficult to accurately assess the performance of novel

310

diagnostic tests.[47] A composite reference standard that combines multiple tests with high specificity

311

but suboptimal sensitivity has been proposed as a possible way to improve diagnostic accuracy.[7,47]

312

Various test combinations have been used as a composite reference standard for typhoid,[47] but

313

respondents in this Delphi exercise advised that the adoption of a standardized composite is required

314

before it can be included in a TPP. A standardized composite might include tests (bone marrow

315

culture, PCR, transcriptomics etc.) that contribute to a reference standard but are not suitable for use

316

in regular practice.

317
318

Typhoid fever is transmitted by the faeco-oral route in water and food contaminated by S. Typhi in

319

human faeces and so is endemic in low-resource environments that lack access to clean water and

320

adequate sanitation. While improvements in the infrastructure for water, sanitation and hygiene could

321

reduce or eliminate typhoid, these are costly long-term endeavors. The newly approved Typbar-TCV

322

vaccine may help to reduce the global burden of enteric fever caused by S. Typhi,[48] but an improved

323

diagnostic test is required to accurately estimate disease incidence and facilitate targeted vaccine

324

deployment. To have a meaningful impact on the overuse of antibiotics that has contributed to the

325

emergence of resistance in S. Typhi and other bacteria, an improved typhoid POC test needs to be

326

used as part of a treatment algorithm in conjunction with diagnostics for malaria and other causes of

327

acute febrile illness. The isolated use of a disease-specific diagnostic test for a febrile patient may help

328

focus treatment if positive, but a negative test may result in alternative empiric antibiotic therapy, as

329

seen for malaria.[24,49] Drug susceptibility testing for S. Typhi, performed at reference laboratories,

330

could inform local treatment algorithms based on regional antibiotic susceptibilities.[50]

331
332

This work provides the first comprehensive TPP for a next-generation POC test for typhoid fever. The

333

main limitations of this study were the lack of consensus agreement for all TPP characteristics, and

334

the relatively low response rate in the second round of the Delphi survey. The length of the survey

335

may have been a barrier to completion due to the amount of time required to provide feedback on all

336

35 TPP characteristics. Further discussion among the typhoid community is needed to settle on the

337

optimal target level of the health care system and the required diagnostic sensitivity. While this TPP is

338

a first step toward improved awareness of the typhoid diagnostic needs, it is crucial to keep the

339

conversation going and to engage global health funders, diagnostics developers, and national policy

340

makers in the discussion on how improved diagnostic tools and related innovations can be used to
