Abstract
BACKGROUND: With the emergence of web-based data collection methods, large digital health
cohorts offer the opportunity to conduct behavioral and epidemiologic research at an
unprecedented scale. The size and breadth of such data sets enable discovery of novel
associations across the phenotypic spectrum.
METHODS: We deployed the digital symbol substitution test (DSST) online to consented
23andMe research participants 50-85 years of age. We tested cross-sectional associations
between DSST performance and 824 phenotypes using linear regression models adjusted for age,
sex, age*sex interaction, device, time of cohort entry, and ancestry, separately among discovery
(n=144,786) and replication (n=93,428) samples; additional analyses further adjusted for
education. We post-stratified association estimates on age, sex, and education to adjust for
discrepancies across subsamples. Leveraging the rich genetic and phenotypic data available at
23andMe, we also estimated genetic and environmental correlations between DSST and its top
correlates using linkage disequilibrium score regression.
RESULTS: 97 phenotypes were significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) and strongly
(standardized effect size > |0.5|) associated with DSST performance in the discovery phase. Of
those, 60 (38 with additional adjustment for education) demonstrated both statistical significance
and consistent direction of association in the replication sample. The significantly associated

phenotypes largely clustered into the following categories: psychiatric traits (e.g. anxiety, β per 1
SD = -0.74, P-value=3.9x10-169), education (e.g. highest math class completed, β per 1 SD =
2.11, P-value<1 x 10-300), leisure activities (e.g. solitary activities like puzzles, β per 1 SD = 1.85,
P-value<1.0x10-300), social determinants (e.g. household income, β per 1 SD = 1.20, P-value=
8.9x10-245, and lifestyle (e.g. years smoked, β per 1 SD = -0.98, P-value= 2.2x10-78). We
identified several reproducible genetic correlations between DSST and its top associated
exposures (e.g. 0.48 for leisure activities like puzzles, 0.28 for years of education, and -0.24 for
anxiety; all P ≤ 7.9x10-26). For almost all exposures, genetic correlations with DSST were
considerably stronger than environmental correlations.
CONCLUSIONS: We have conducted the largest study of cognitive performance to date,
building evidence supporting its correlations with many social, lifestyle, and clinical exposures.
We established that the observed associations are in part underpinned by shared genetic
architecture. Our study illustrates the potential of large-scale digital cohorts to contribute to
epidemiologic discovery.

Introduction
The advent of web-based data collection has dramatically transformed the landscape of
epidemiologic studies, allowing fast and cost-effective phenotype ascertainment at an
unprecedentedly large scale. The promise of this technology is well illustrated by behavioral,
perceptual, and cognitive research. Even with potential noise introduced by device or hardware
variability, digital assessments offer enhanced precision and greater accessibility at a lower cost
(1). Consequently, the field of psychometrics has been steadily transitioning towards digital,
specifically web-based, implementation of classic neurocognitive tasks.
The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), a widely used measure of cognitive
processing speed, has been successfully computerized (2) and administered online (3). DSST
asks a participant to match symbols to numbers according to a provided key; performance is
operationalized as the number of correct matches over a predefined time interval (usually 90
seconds). A compelling body of evidence characterizes DSST as valid, reliable, brief, and
especially sensitive to changes in cognitive function over time (4). In addition to capturing
neurocognitive variability, DSST scores (adjusted for age and other demographic factors) have
been prospectively linked to cardiovascular risk (5) and overall mortality (6). Performance on
DSST is inversely correlated with age (7) and male sex (8), and has a substantial genetic
component (twin study-derived h2=0.62) (9). However, evidence in support of other potential
contributors, including education, medical conditions, or lifestyle factors, is either inconsistent
across studies or does not yet exist. A deeper understanding of environmental contributions to
DSST performance is essential for rigorous applications of this test in clinical and epidemiologic
studies, e.g. for unbiased and precise estimation of associated disease risk, or for planning
neurocognitive interventions.

To date, the 23andMe customer database contains the largest sample of DSST
completions (N>200,000), coupled with a broad spectrum of genetic and environmental data.
Leveraging this unique resource, we have conducted the first comprehensive, environment-wide
study (ENWAS) of DSST performance in the 50-85 year age group. We integrated our findings
with genotype data to estimate genetic correlations between DSST performance and its top
environmental correlates, and compared genetic and environmental contributions to the observed
phenotypic correlations. Finally, we evaluated reproducibility of our findings in an independent
subsample of the 23andMe dataset. Our manuscript highlights the feasibility of administering
DSST online in large-scale studies, as well as the utility of the 23andMe database to advance
etiologic understanding of cognitive function.

Methods
Throughout the study, we used R (10) for all statistical analyses and figures.
Study population
The study population comprised 23andMe customers of European ancestry between 50 and 85
years of age, who resided in the United States, provided informed consent, and completed the
DSST task online. Due to the visual nature of the DSST, we excluded participants who selfreported serious vision deficiencies, including age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein
occlusion, and retinitis pigmentosa. Differences in demographic and clinical covariates were
compared using t-tests for continuous variables and Chi-squared tests for categorical variables.
The human subjects research protocol was approved by Ethical and Independent Review
Services (www.eandireview.com), an external institutional review board accredited by the

Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs. This study complied
with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Trait selection for the ENWAS
All traits tested for association with DSST were ascertained via web- or mobile-based surveys
developed either in-house by 23andMe or previously published (e.g. the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index, PSQI)(11). We started with a broad range of phenotypes including health behaviors,
personality traits, socioeconomic status, demographic variables, or clinical conditions. We
subsequently included additional phenotypes derived from surveys focused on sleep, nutrition,
and leisure activities. We excluded phenotypes that were later used as covariates in the ENWAS
association models (e.g. age), traits with a predominantly genetic etiology (e.g. eye color), or
those pertaining to medication response. These selection procedures yielded an initial list of 1033
traits. To avoid redundancy, we computed pairwise correlation coefficients for the 1033 initial
phenotypes. For pairs that were highly correlated (|r|>0.80), we removed the phenotype with the
smaller sample size to maximize statistical power. We further removed traits for which models
would fail to converge due to lack of variation in the sample. The final phenotype list for the
ENWAS included 824 traits.
DSST administration and quality control
Two versions of DSST were deployed to our participants via the 23andMe website: one
developed externally (the discovery dataset) and one developed in-house following identical
specifications (the replication dataset). In both versions, the participants were presented with a
key linking numbers and nine symbols (chosen at random from a symbol bank). They were first
given the opportunity to practice selecting the correctly paired number for each of the four
symbols sequentially shown on the screen. Following the practice round, the participants were

asked to indicate as many correct pairings of numbers to symbols as possible during a 90 second
interval.
The DSST score (i.e. number of correct trials per 90 seconds) distribution did not
significantly deviate from normal, thus we did not transform the outcome. We excluded
participants deemed outliers in DSST performance (100 or more correct trials per 90 seconds).
After exclusions, we had data from a total of 238,214 individuals in the 50-85 age range who had
completed the DSST game by the time of the analysis. Given the importance of age to cognitive
outcomes and its potential for non-linear effects, we used loess regression to model the
relationship between DSST performance and age in the total sample, stratified by sex.
ENWAS
We modeled environment-wide associations using linear regressions with the number of correct
DSST trials per 90 seconds as the outcome and each of the phenotypes as the main predictor,
adjusted for age, sex, age*sex, device (desktop vs. laptop), five ancestry principal components,
and version of the genotyping platform (used as a proxy for time of cohort entry). The model fit
as a sensitivity analysis further adjusted for self-reported years of education. For the phenotypes
that were sex-specific (e.g. age at first menses or azoospermia), the models above excluded sex
and its interaction term with age. To protect against possible model misspecification, standard
errors for all association estimates were derived from robust sandwich variance estimators. We
additionally computed standardized (i.e. expressed per one standard deviation of the exposure)
association estimates in each model to facilitate comparisons across traits. P-values were
adjusted using the Benjamini-Yakutieli false discovery rate (FDR) approach to account for the
residual phenotypic correlations, and adjusted P < 0.05 was used as a cut-off. We additionally
filtered on post-stratified standardized effect size estimates, with |0.5| as a cut-off to ensure a

meaningful association. Exposures that met these two criteria were carried forward to the
replication phase. Models including identical covariates were fit to the discovery and replication
data sets. Criteria for successful replication were set as 1) FDR P < 0.05 and 2) same direction of
association in both discovery and replication analyses.
Post-stratification of environment-wide association estimates
Data on the 824 putative correlates of DSST were collected via many different surveys, and most
23andMe participants typically only complete a subset of these surveys. Therefore, sample sizes
for each environment-wide model varied widely. Moreover, the subsamples varied in their
distributions of key demographic covariates: age, sex, and education. Because of these
imbalances, we considered the total sample with available DSST data as the reference population
and post-stratified association estimates for each environment-wide model. To create weights for
post-stratification, we started with proportions of age groups (50-59, 60-69, and 70-85 years) and
education (college-educated or not); unless the predictor was sex-specific (e.g. age at first
menses), weights also included the male vs. female proportion. We then employed the iterative
raking algorithm (12), which converges on a set of weights that ensure that the joint distribution
of the post-stratification variables (i.e. age, sex, and education) matches that in the total DSST
sample. The sandwich variance estimator described earlier was used to approximate the standard
error of each post-stratified association estimate.
Genetic correlations
We leveraged available genotype data on all participants (previously described in (13)) to
explore the shared genetic architecture of cognitive performance and its top phenotypic
correlates. We estimated genetic correlations between the DSST score and 32 phenotypes using
linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (14), a widely used method predicated on the

relationship between association test statistics for a given variant and its LD score under a
polygenic model. Because most replicated correlates of DSST could be assigned to distinct
groups (e.g. socioeconomic variables, health behaviors, psychiatric traits), we chose
representative traits from each group for the genetic correlation analysis, taking into account
sample size and strength of the association. We also included two negative controls, i.e. traits we
found to be unassociated with DSST (red meat intake and kidney stones), for which we would
expect a null genetic correlation. Advantages of the LD score regression approach include
computational efficiency and validity under the condition of sample overlap, which was
observed in our data. Genetic correlations were computed separately in the discovery and
replication data sets; similarly to the environment-wide association study, successful replication
was defined as P < multiple-testing corrected significance threshold and consistent direction of
the genetic correlation across samples. The Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for
multiple comparisons.
Environmental correlations
In addition to genetic correlations, we also estimated environmental correlations between DSST
and its top environmental correlates using the formula proposed by Sodini et al.(15):

The majority of study participants were female, reflecting the sex breakdown of the source
population of 23andMe customers. As DSST was targeted to individuals who were 50 years of
age or older, median participant age was in the mid-60s. Compared to the overall US population
in the 50+ year age group (16), our sample was approximately twice as likely to graduate from
college. However, lifestyle characteristics (namely the percentage of never smokers and median

BMI) were consistent with nationwide estimates (17, 18). Participants had the option to complete
the task on either desktops or laptops; women were more likely to report the latter. Average
performance on the DSST was comparable to that reported in a prior meta-analysis of data from
3,876 older adults (7). Similarly consistent with prior literature (8, 19), women on average
performed better than men. In the combined discovery and replication sample, we observed a
significant interaction between age and sex on DSST performance, with women exhibiting a
slower age-related decline in average DSST performance (Supplementary Figure 1).
Most tests comparing demographics between discovery and replication cohorts were
statistically significant; however, sample sizes of this magnitude typically lead to small P-values
without meaningful differences. For example, the P-value comparing age distributions was
3.2x10-15, while the mean was 64.3 years in the discovery cohort and 64.0 in the replication
cohort. Hence Table 1 does not contain P-values comparing the two subcohorts but rather shows
measures of central tendency and dispersion for continuous variables and subgroup proportions
for categorical variables. An important difference was observed for income and education, which
were more likely to be missing in the replication cohort. This phenomenon arose from a change
in data collection strategy: collecting data on socioeconomic variables was deprioritized.
ENWAS
Definitions of all traits used in the ENWAS are provided in Supplementary Text 1. Subcohorts
for each trait, which contained all participants who completed the DSST and had data on that
specific trait as well as model covariates, ranged in size from 200 to 132,281 (discovery) and 948
to 74,744 (replication). We did not consider exposures for which N<200 for reasons of statistical
power. Of the 824 exposures considered in the study, 557 were significantly (FDR < 0.05)
associated with the DSST outcome in the discovery cohort after adjustment for relevant

covariates (age, sex, proxy variable for cohort entry, age*sex interaction, and ancestry principal
components) (Supplementary Table 1a). Additional adjustment for education (defined as less
than college/ college or above) attenuated most estimates of association and reduced the number
of significant associations to 532. We post-stratified the trait-specific estimates to the overall
DSST sample on age, sex, and education (only age and sex in education-adjusted models). Poststratification did not meaningfully impact association estimates for most variables, except for
those collected on smaller (N<5,000) subsets of participants. Similarly and predictably, the
largest shifts in variance estimates due to the implementation of the sandwich estimator also
occurred in the smallest subcohorts.
To enable comparisons of associations across models and facilitate interpretation, we
multiplied post-standardized regression coefficients by the standard deviation of the exposure;
such standardized effect estimates ranged from -1.02 to 2.11 (-0.93 to 1.84 in education-adjusted
models). We focused all subsequent analyses on exposures for which the absolute value of the
post-stratified association estimate exceeded 0.50 – an effect size per SD of exposure comparable
to that of some antidepressants or benzodiazepines in prior studies of DSST (4). In the discovery
phase, 97 traits met this criterion in addition to statistical significance (67 traits when
additionally adjusted for education). Top traits associated with DSST were grouped into the
following categories: education/socioeconomic status (e.g. vocabulary test score), musical ability
(e.g. self-reported ability to sing back a note), mental health traits (e.g. the depression anxiety
stress scale (DASS) anxiety subscore (20)), other health traits (e.g. self-rated general health),
lifestyle (e.g. the PSQI score (11) as a measure of sleep), and other (e.g. tendency to eat before
sleep). Post-stratified and standardized association estimates for representative traits from each

namely red meat intake and kidney stones), is presented in Table 2 (discovery) and

In the LD score regression analyses, heritability of DSST performance was estimated at 0.16
(SE=0.008). LD score regression performs less reliably for traits with lower heritability;
therefore, Bulik-Sullivan et al. (14) have proposed a heritability Z-score cutoff of 4. One variable
in our data set (small lateral incisors) had a Z-score < 4 and was removed; therefore, 31 traits
were retained for the correlation analysis. Exposure heritabilities varied from 0.03 (self-reported
sleep problems) to 0.17 (highest math class taken). As expected, DSST was neither genetically
nor environmentally correlated with the negative controls. Overall, 30 traits had a significant
genetic correlation and 12 had a significant environmental correlation with DSST; of those, 24
genetic correlations and 11 environmental correlations were successfully replicated. As a
general pattern with few exceptions (e.g. household income), estimates of genetic correlation

Discussion
Using the ENWAS framework, we carried out the first comprehensive investigation of nongenetic contributions to cognitive performance in a large sample of US-based 23andMe research

customers of European descent. We identified numerous reproducible associations between
DSST scores and predictors that are both known (e.g. smoking (21) or sleep (22)) and novel (e.g.
mathematical ability or numbness of extremities). Leveraging genotype data available on the
same individuals, we also showed that the observed phenotypic correlations are in part due to the
shared genetic architecture of DSST performance and its top environmental predictors.
We chose DSST as a metric of cognitive performance for several reasons. DSST is easily
administered via the web, and reliable (23); it is indicative of multiple cognitive functions,
including processing speed, attention, visual and spatial perception, and executive function (24).
Optimally for our cohort, DSST offers higher sensitivity at moderate to high levels of cognition
compared to other tests, e.g. the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (25). Notably, DSST
performance is widely believed to be only minimally affected by linguistic, cultural, or
educational factors (4). However, most associations observed in our study were sensitive to
adjustment for educational achievement, and measures of socioeconomic status and education
prominently figured on the list of top associations, indicating that the impact of education may
not be so minimal after all. The underlying mechanisms likely include both direct effects of
education on cognition and cognitive effects of socioeconomic status, for which education may
be used as a proxy. For example, the latter (socioeconomic) effect may be mediated by stress,
triggered by financial insecurity and known to affect DSST performance (26). Consistent with
this hypothesis, perceived stress was strongly (standardized effect size: -1.02, P=2.30*10-120) and
reproducibly associated with DSST performance in our sample. As for the former (direct) effect,
education has previously been postulated to increase cognitive reserve, defined as an individual’s
ability to maintain higher function despite onset of various brain pathologies (27), by increasing
controlled (i.e. not automatic) cognitive processes and conceptualization abilities (28). Although

the buffering role of cognitive reserve has been established for most chronic brain pathologies
(27), previous investigations of the effect of education on DSST performance yielded mixed
results. In some disease settings (e.g. Alzheimer’s (29)), evidence favors a protective effect of
education on age-related decline in DSST performance, and in others (e.g. brain infarct (30))
such effects are null. In contrast to disease-focused studies, our sample was recruited from the
general population of 50-85 year old 23andMe customers rather than a neurodegenerative disease
cohort, enriched for college-educated individuals, and restricted to individuals who could
independently complete at least one survey and the DSST task. Consistently with our
observations, education was strongly associated with DSST performance in other healthy
populations (8). Our findings highlight the importance of education and socioeconomic status to
DSST performance in non-clinical settings, and suggest that future studies of DSST would
benefit from accounting for educational heterogeneity in both design and analysis.
The ENWAS paradigm provides a useful way to systematically and agnostically
interrogate many potential associations while properly controlling for multiple testing. It is
especially well suited for large-scale cohorts with a broad spectrum of phenotypic measurements,
such as the 23andMe population. Several methodological caveats, however, complicate the
interpretation of such studies. A recent review by Manrai et al. (31) identified several threats to
the validity of ENWAS findings: unadjusted confounding, challenges of measuring dynamic
environmental exposures, the correlated nature of the exposures, and ‘excessive’ statistical
power leading to detection of etiologically insignificant, small effects. We would like to add the
difficulty of comparing effects across both traits and subpopulations to this list and offer several
suggestions for ENWAS best practice. First, we ensured that our discovery results (both in
ENWAS and the genetic/environmental correlation analyses) are reproducible in an a priori

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19009076; this version posted November 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

selected data set of independent individuals representing the same source population of 23andMe
customers. Second, we standardized our association estimates to enable easy comparisons and
prioritization of findings. Third, because the subsets of participants with information on each
trait often varied in age, sex, and education, we post-stratified our association estimates on these
variables to reduce the spurious effects of such unbalances. In our study, post-stratification and
the use of robust variance estimators did not dramatically change our estimates for most
subcohorts in our study because of their large sample size. Nevertheless, for subcohorts ranging
from several hundred to several thousand (N<5,000) individuals (i.e. cohorts comparable in size
to most epidemiologic studies), these procedures did have a pronounced effect and should be
implemented to reduce bias and appropriately quantify uncertainty. Fourth, we filtered our
findings on absolute standardized effect size, so that the impact of our reported findings exceeds
that observed in experimental studies of clinically meaningful exposures (namely antidepressant
use and sleep deprivation) on DSST performance. Such filtering reduces the likelihood that our
findings were falsely positive (heeding Hill’s strength of association guideline (32)) and focuses
the subsequent analyses on exposures that are likely to matter most for cognition. Fifth, we
incorporated genomic data to probe some of the mechanisms underlying the observed
associations, which can be challenging to do in a large-scale, cross-sectional study.
Specifically, we established that many of the replicated ENWAS associations are at least
partially underpinned by shared genetic architecture. Estimates of genetic correlation were
especially striking for engagement in solitary leisure activities like puzzles (rg=0.48, P=7.44x1091

), as well as for various metrics of mathematical and musical education (e.g. whether someone

played music before the age of eight, rg=0.29, P=7.91x10-18). These are predictors that are
commonly considered environmental rather than genetic. For example, exposure to music

lessons in childhood is more likely to be construed as a marker of parental socioeconomic status
rather than of innate ability. But even parental socioeconomic status is not an exclusively
environmental predictor, because it is strongly correlated with parental educational attainment,
which in turn has a genetic component (33) that is also passed down to the offspring. Therefore,
it is not surprising to see statistically significant genetic correlations between DSST performance
and measures of education/socioeconomic status. Crucially, numerous prior studies have
demonstrated that genetic influences on cognition are more pronounced in a) older adults and b)
more affluent populations (34): both conditions accurately characterize the 23andMe DSST
cohort. Supporting this hypothesis, our estimates of environmental correlations between DSST
and our variables of interest (e.g. for playing music before the age of eight, re= 0.13, P=
P=7.61x10-5) were significant yet consistently lower than their genetic counterparts. These
findings may not generalize to cohorts with greater socioeconomic and educational diversity,
where environmental factors account for a larger percentage of cognitive variability (35).
Combining the ENWAS framework with genomic data, we have identified multiple
strong associations with DSST performance. Many of these associations have previously been
reported; for example, the inverse relationship between psychiatric symptoms and DSST scores
is well known. However, evidence supporting relationships between DSST performance and
other health conditions or lifestyle variables is only beginning to emerge. A recent analysis of the
UK Biobank data (36) has linked self-reported chronic inflammatory conditions, defined broadly
to include musculoskeletal, endocrine, autoimmune, and other conditions, to decreased DSST
performance. In our data set, self-reported administration of anti-inflammatory medication was
similarly associated with lower DSST scores (standardized effect: -0.35, P-value= 4x10-16 in the
discovery cohort), although it did not pass the effect size threshold we used to prioritize the

associations. Moreover, our data set offers greater granularity of associations: among chronic
conditions included under the UK Biobank’s umbrella definition of inflammatory, we note that
the greatest reductions in DSST were observed for participants with type 2 diabetes, followed by
COPD and rheumatoid arthritis (Supplementary Table 1a). Furthermore, we showed the
associations with inflammatory conditions and DSST were considerably (>10%) attenuated upon
adjustment for education attainment. The breadth of our database also enabled identifying novel
inverse associations between chronic disease and cognitive performance, e.g. among patients
with nephritis or back pain. Other novel and reproducible findings included positive relationships
between mathematical and musical education earlier in life and DSST performance in older
adulthood, as well as between current engagement with leisure activities (e.g. puzzles or
computer games) and cognitive performance.
Because we are reporting on cross-sectional data, we are limited in inferring both
temporality and causality from observed associations. For exposures pertaining to childhood or
early adulthood (music lessons, education), the temporality of exposure preceding the DSST
outcome is implied, because all of our participants were 50 years of age or older at the time of
DSST. For many other exposures, cognitive ability (as measured by DSST) may affect both the
quality of collected information (thus leading to bias) or be upstream of the exposures considered
in our study (reverse causality). Another potential limitation is the possibility of residual
confounding. Although we adjusted for education as the best proxy of socioeconomic status
available on most individuals, the role of other potential confounders should be explored in
future, more narrowly focused studies. Finally, the demographic composition of our cohort-mostly college-educated older individuals of European descent-- limits generalizations to other,
more diverse populations.

Like in previous ENWAS, the primary application of our findings lies in generating
etiologic hypotheses and prioritizing non-genetic exposures for future studies in smaller, well
phenotyped cohorts. In agreement with previous twin and SNP-based heritability studies, our
analyses also show that many of the exposures identified in our study have a genetic component
that can be leveraged in pursuit of greater etiologic understanding. For example, a recent
Mendelian randomization study (37) used genetic anchors to investigate the causal relationship
between sleep duration and cognition in the UK Biobank and found evidence of a non-linear
relationship. These insights can inform interventions to improve cognition in older adults,
focusing on modifiable factors with the strongest causal effects. However, the cost and effort
involved in such interventions requires rigorous selection of appropriate exposures, and we
demonstrated that ENWAS on large-scale cohorts can be its fruitful first step. In conclusion, the
findings of our study showcase the utility of 1) the combined ENWAS + genomics approach and
2) the 23andMe database to comprehensively interrogate contributions to cognitive performance
in older adulthood.
