Abstract
The spread of dengue through global human mobility is a major public health concern. A
key challenge is understanding the transmission pathways and mediating factors that
characterized the patterns of dengue importation into non-endemic areas. Utilizing a network
connectivity-based approach, we analyze the importation patterns of dengue fever into European
countries.
Seven connectivity indices were developed to characterize the role of the air passenger
traffic, seasonality, incidence rate, geographical proximity, epidemic vulnerability, and wealth of
a source country, in facilitating the transport and importation of dengue fever. We used
generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the relationship between dengue
importation and the connectivity indices while accounting for the air transport network structure.
We also incorporated network autocorrelation within a GLMM framework to investigate the
propensity of a European country to receive an imported case, by virtue of its position within the
air transport network.
The connectivity indices and dynamical processes of the air transport network were
strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe. With more than 70% of the variation in
dengue importation patterns explained. We found that transportation potential was higher for
source countries with seasonal dengue activity, high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, lower
economic status, and geographical proximity to a destination country in Europe. We also found
that position of a European country within the air transport network was a strong predictor of the
country’s propensity to receive an imported case.
Our findings provide evidence that the importation patterns of dengue into Europe can be
largely explained by appropriately characterizing the heterogeneities of the source, and topology
of the air transport network. This contributes to the foundational framework for building
integrated predictive models for bio-surveillance of dengue importation.

Introduction
During the last few decades, dengue fever has rapidly spread into new geographical
regions with a resultant increase in its global incidence [1, 2]. This global spread has notably
been linked to increasing human mobility, particularly air travel [3-5]. Global aviation network
has increased in volume by almost eight-fold in the past 40years, enabling human movement
across long distances in a relatively short time [6-8]. Thus, creating a mobility network for the
spread of infectious diseases like dengue [9-11]. Infected air travelers have contributed
significantly to the importation of dengue to non-endemic areas [12-14].
As human mobility and connectivity continue to advance, dengue spread via importation
will continue to increase at unpredictable rates [4, 15]. The complexity of the air transport
network poses a substantial challenge in the understanding of the dynamics of dengue spread and
importation [16, 17]. How to effectively tackle dengue spread mediated via the complex air
transport network is a priority of vector-borne disease surveillance and control [18-20]. In this
context, understanding the dynamics by which dengue fever is transported, across the complex
and dynamic mobility network, is an important first step [5].
Previous work on network-mediated epidemic often assumes a common framework, that
the probability of an imported infection is directly correlated with the number of arriving air
passengers [13, 21]. However, a simple correlation between imported cases and crude travel
statistics is insufficient to explain the transmission pathways [21]. Such an approach does not
allow to differentiate imported cases arriving from countries with higher infection risk and
transport potential, or if the variance in the number of cases is also mediated by other socioeconomic and anthropogenic factors. Neither does this capture the connectivity patterns of the
mobility network that influence or constrains the dynamics of importation.
Recent studies have applied a range of social network modeling approaches to
understanding the transmission pathways of a network-mediated epidemic. From a general
perspective, these methods combine the derived attributes of the epidemic source country and the
topology of the transporting network to explain importation dynamics [17, 22]. Epidemic source
attributes are characterized by the heterogeneities in the passenger’s air travel volume, socioeconomic and anthropogenic factors, that mediate the risk of infection and transport of the

disease [23]. While the network topology is characterized by centrality measures of the nodes
(countries) in the air transport network. [24, 25]. To our knowledge, there are no studies that
apply this explanatory power of social network analysis to characterize dengue importation
patterns into Europe.

Here, we adopt a refined network connectivity approach to analyze data on imported
dengue cases from 21 European countries, within a 6-year period (2010 – 2015). Specifically,
our approach is outlined in the following: (1) We integrate a source-to-destination country
combination to construct a network connectivity for dengue importation; (2) We then examine
connectivity measures accounting for factors mediating the transport and importation potential
from the source country; (3) Lastly, we investigate how the topology of the air transport network
influences the importation risk from a source and the propensity of a destination country to
receive an imported case.

Methods
Conceptual framework
Our proposed network connectivity framework adapts techniques from previous work on
dispersal connectivity, spatial autocorrelation and network modelling [25-28] to capture the
dynamics of dengue importation. The inputs for our analysis consist of the dengue importation
data, air travel data and the underlying air transport network structure.
In the sections below, we describe the various inputs and our modeling approaches. In the
first section, we describe the disease and air travel data, with their respective sources. Next, we
describe the connectivity indices representing factors that potentially facilitate the transport and
importation of dengue from a source country into Europe. We then describe the generalized
linear mixed effect (GLMM) modelling approach for quantifying the variation in dengue
importation as explained by the indices.
The next section introduces the concept of dependency network analysis to account for
the influence of the air transport network structure. Firstly, we describe the construct of the

weighted directed network from the air passenger’s data and then define centrality measures to
characterize each individual node’s (i.e. country) influence within the network. The centrality
measures of the source countries were then added to the GLMM model of the connectivity
indices to account for the influence of network structure. Finally, we describe an extension of our
analysis to model the propensity of a country in Europe to receive an imported case, by virtue of
its network topology (i.e. centrality measures).

Disease data
We analyzed imported cases of dengue fever reported in Europe for the period of 2010 –
2015. Dengue fever data was obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC) [29]. Routine (weekly) Europe-wide infectious disease surveillance data is
collected from European Economic Area member states (EU/EEA) countries by the ECDC. Data
is collected and managed through The European Surveillance System (TESSy) database; a
database provided by the ECDC national focal points for surveillance [30].
Here, we considered confirmed cases of dengue, according to the 2012 EU case
definition for viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) which defines a confirmed case as any person
meeting the clinical and the laboratory criteria [31]. The subset of imported cases or travelassociated cases are categorized as persons having been outside the country of notification
during the incubation period of the disease. Place/country of infection was defined as the place
the person was during the incubation period of the disease. A total of 21 EU/EEA countries
reported data on imported dengue, within the period of 2010 – 2015 (inclusive of zero reporting).
For our analysis, we considered each imported case, its country of infection (as source country),
the reporting country (as destination country) and the reporting month.

Air travel data
To describe the flow of individuals into Europe, we obtained the passenger air travel data
for 2010 – 2015, from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) [32]. IATA Passenger
Intelligence Services (PaxIS) data, is the most comprehensive airline passenger’s data available

today. Data includes the complete passenger itineraries, true origins and destinations, route
segments and connecting points. The data contained over 11,996 airports in 229 different
countries and their territorial dependencies, with calibrated passenger travel volumes for each
route at a monthly timescale. The passenger volumes were available at the country level, i.e. the
total number of passengers traveling from each country worldwide. We used these data to
construct a monthly directional passenger flow from all countries worldwide with a final
destination in Europe (also accounting for all connecting flights). This passenger flow was
inclusive of flow in-between European countries.

Connectivity indices
We assembled seven indices representing factors potentially mediating the importation
risk of dengue from a source country. These indices are decomposed into components
representing the ‘source strength’ (the risk of dengue infection); and the transport and
importation potential (the connection between the source country and the potential destination
country in Europe).
Indices 1 and 2, characterize dengue monthly activity and annual seasonality in the
source country. These indices were created using worldwide dengue outbreak notifications data
from DengueMap (a unified data collection tool, that brings together disparate dengue reports of
local or imported dengue cases from official, newspapers and other media sources globally) [33].
Index 1 is defined as having one or more confirmed cases in a given month (January-December)
in the years of 2010 through 2015, index 2 is defined as having dengue activity (i.e. notification
of one or more confirmed cases) in a given month in two or more years from 2010 through 2015
[34]. Index 3 is the annual dengue incidence estimates of source country adjusted for the
country’s population, obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [35,
36]. Index 4 is the geographical distance between centroids of source country and destination
country, often modelled as a proxy for travel time and predictor for epidemic arrival times [37].
This assumes that proximity to an endemic source increases transport and importation potential
to destination. Index 5 is the epidemic vulnerability of the source country, represented by the
recent infectious disease vulnerability index from RAND cooperation [38]. This index identifies
countries' vulnerabilities to control potential disease outbreaks by assessing a confluence of

seven broad country level factors: demographic, health care, public health, disease dynamics,
political-domestic, political-international and economic [38]. This index assumes that most
vulnerable countries might pose a higher risk of infection and transportation. Index 6 is the
income per capita (GDP) of source countries; poor countries with weak economies are associated
with poor health outcomes, lesser abilities to detect, prevent and respond effectively to infectious
disease. Hence, we assume greater importation risk from poorer source countries. Index 7 is the
total arriving passengers from source country to destination country (i.e. accounting for both
direct and connecting flights) which has often been correlated with disease importation [13], with
an implicit assumption that infection risk is equal for all source countries. Hence an increase in
passengers, in turn, increases the transport and importation potential.
Source strength for all indices was determined by the endemicity of dengue in the source
country, while transport and importation potential were modelled based on each unique factor, as
detailed in Table 1 below.

To quantify the variation in dengue importation as explained by our proposed

analysis was the monthly source-destination country combination, with a binary response
variable coded to indicate a reported case of imported dengue (1) or not (0). The GLMM was
fitted with logit link functions for binomial errors and fixed effects of the connectivity indices
and a crossed random effects (intercepts) of the destination country and time step (in a month).
We also included a fixed effect for time to control for the following: specific global aviation

traffic effects, i.e. increase or decrease in traffic to a specific country, due to a major event (e.g.
traffic increase to London, during the 2012 summer Olympics), and to account for underreporting or no report for countries in specific months. To improve normality, the continuous
fixed effects variables were transformed using the log(𝑥 + 1) function, then centered on zero,
and standardized to unit variance, before model fitting. Model fits were evaluated by calculating
the marginal and conditional GLMM 𝑅 2 [40]. Likewise, model post-estimation using model
diagnostic measures and residuals plots were evaluated using the DHARMa residual diagnostics
for hierarchical models [41].

Dependency network

Next, to explore the influence of the air transport network structure on the variation of
dengue importation, we incorporate the dependency network approach. This is a system level
analysis of the activity and topology of the air transport network to investigate the capacity of a
country to influence or be influenced by, other countries within the network by virtue of their
connections [42-44]. The specificity of network influence on dengue importation risk is that the
connectivity between a source country (𝑖) and a destination county (𝑗) is not analyzed in
isolation, but in consideration for the effects of 𝑧, where 𝑧 , is the other countries within the
network structure. The implication of this network structural view is that the connection between
𝑖 and 𝑗 is also dependent on the connections between 𝑖 and 𝑧 and between 𝑗 and 𝑧. Therefore, the
distributed heterogeneity in the connections is characterized by interdependencies within the
network and must be accounted for statistically [25, 45].

Using IATA passengers air travel data, we constructed 72 weighted directed networks, to
represent the monthly flow of air passengers into Europe, from 2010 to 2015. For each network,
countries are represented by a node while edges represent the flow of passengers between pairs.
The network graph is denoted by 𝐺𝑚 = (𝑉, 𝐸), where 𝑉𝐺 is a set containing all the nodes (or
vertices), while 𝐸𝐺 contains all the edges, with 𝑚 indicating the month. Edges are denoted as 𝑒𝑖,𝑗 ,
where 𝑖 is the source and 𝑗 is the destination of a travel route represented by the edge. For each

connected pair of nodes 𝑖 and 𝑗, the edge was weighted with the total number of passengers from
𝑖 to 𝑗 given by 𝑊𝑖𝑗 (Fig 1).

Fig 1. Air transport network. The weighted, directed network, constructed from IATA passenger’s data with a
final destination in Europe. Each node is one country, and the size of a node is proportional to the average number of
passengers in a month.

The role of a node in the network and its likelihood to influence the transport and importation
potential of dengue was then characterized by the following centrality measures (Table 2):

Degree centrality. The number of links or connections that a node has, this assigns a
score based on the number of nodes within the network, that an individual node is connected to
[42, 45]. The higher a node's degree, the more it associates with neighboring nodes, potentially
increasing its transport potential or increases its vulnerability to importation (in the case of a
destination country).

Betweenness centrality. Measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path
between other nodes in the network [42]. A node with high betweenness metric is expected to
have a higher transport potential, as it bridges between different nodes that are not directly

connected. Alternatively, destination countries with high betweenness are at higher risk of
importation.
Closeness centrality. measures how close (in terms of topological distance) a node is
with respect to all other nodes [46]. The topological distance between any pair of connected
nodes is given by the inverse of the number of passengers in the corresponding edge. Therefore,
the higher the number of passengers in a given edge, the shorter the distance between them, the
faster an infection gets transported or imported.
Eigenvector centrality. The basic idea of the eigenvector centrality is that a node’s
centrality is determined by the combination of its connections and that of its neighbors [47, 48].
A node will have high eigenvector centrality if it has strong connections with other highly
connected nodes. In our context, if a node is connected to other highly influential nodes, the
higher its transport potential or the higher its vulnerability to importation from a random source
in the network.

To quantify the influence of the air transport network topology, we employ two different
modelling approaches. Firstly, we account for the network structure in our connectivity
framework, by including the centrality measures of the source country. We tested whether
GLMMs based on connectivity indices and the air network centrality measures outperformed the
base model based on the connectivity indices alone. GLMMs were fitted with the same random
effect structure as above. All possible combinations of centrality measures were considered,
resultant models were compared based on their fixed effects ∆AIC and marginal GLMM 𝑅 2 .

Secondly, we model the network topology of the focal destination country as a dependent
variable. This assumes that dengue importation into a focal destination country could be directly
related to the country’s position in the air transport network. For this model, centrality measures
were fitted as fixed effects, with crossed random effects (intercepts) of each node (i.e. each
destination country) and time step (m). As above, all possible models were fitted and compared
based on their fixed effects ∆AIC and marginal GLMM 𝑅 2 .

All analysis and plots were performed in R software, version 3.5.2 [49], using the
following libraries: glmmtmb [50], igraph [51], tnam [52], DHARMa [41], sjstats [53], ggplot2
[54], circlize [55] and their varying dependencies.

Results
Among the 7,277 imported dengue cases reported in Europe from 2010 to 2015, 4,112
(57.0%) cases had known travel history, i.e. source country of infection. The cases with the
known source were imported into 21 European countries, from 99 different countries distributed
across all global regions. 62.1% of reported cases originated from South-East Asia Region, with
Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka being the major source of import; 18.0% originated
from Region of the Americas, with most cases coming from Brazil; 12.1% from the Western
Pacific Region, where Vietnam and the Philippines were the major import source. The data

common in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Most of the identified
dengue importation hot spots were characterized by a high influx of air passengers, with a
tendency for an increase in importation risk. However, the high influx of passengers does not
necessarily lead to a high number of imported cases of dengue, as total number of arriving
passengers was weakly correlated with the number of imported cases (Spearman’s ƿ = 0.13,
p=<0.01, S1 Fig).

Connectivity indices and dengue importation
Our first model investigated the relationship between dengue importation and the
connectivity indices. Table 3 presents the results of the GLMM model with estimated
coefficients, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each connectivity index. The estimated
coefficients represent the relative influence of each connectivity index on the risk of dengue
importation between source–destination country combinations. In this model, dengue
importation was significantly associated with the following connectivity measures: dengue
activity, seasonality, incidence rates, geographical distance, the wealth of source country and
arriving passengers. Evaluating the model independently of random effects variance component,
these connectivity indices account for 48% (marginal GLMM 𝑅 2 of 0.478) of the variation in
dengue importation patterns. Overall the GLMM model accounted for 74% (conditional GLMM
𝑅 2 of 0.740) of the variation in dengue importation into Europe. The model fit was adequate, the
simulated residual diagnostics test for overall uniformity showed no evidence of model
misspecification.

Influence of air transport network topology
The resulting air transport network from the passenger’s data was a directed graph
structure with 229 nodes and 10261 edges. We took the mean of each centrality measure across
the 72 weighted networks to obtain a single value for each node. Based on the mean centrality
measures, the following source countries were most central in respect to all metrics: Canada,
United States, Australia, United Arab Emirates, China and Brazil (Fig 4). The network metrics
displayed notable relationships, with moderate-to-high correlations amongst themselves (S2 Fig).
Betweenness and Eigenvector centrality pairs were the most highly correlated (Spearman’s ƿ =
1.00, p <.001). Hence to avoid redundancy in model fitting, we added the correlated pairs in
separate models. All the network metrics examined were significant predictors of dengue
importation. Compared with the base model of the connectivity indices alone, GLMM fits were
substantially improved by including the effects of the network topology (Fig 5). The best-fitting
model was the model with degree and betweenness centrality measure pair, alongside the
connectivity indices (Table 3). The inclusion of these covariates slightly changed the relative
influence of the connectivity indices, with the epidemic vulnerability index becoming
statistically significant.

Network topology as a predictor of importation
Focal destination countries that were most central in the network were the United
Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France (Fig 6). Therefore, they are most vulnerable to
dengue importation from a random source country. The centrality measures were highly
correlated amongst themselves, hence it was practically redundant to include all measures in a
single model (S2 Fig). We added each centrality measure in separate models, to capture the
influence of the unique aspect of each nodal centrality. Each centrality measure was a significant

Discussion
The importation of dengue into non-endemic regions is primarily initiated by global
human mobility, hence it is critical to understand the dynamics of the transmission pathways
based on the mobility networks. Here, we applied a refine network connectivity approach to
model the importation of dengue into Europe. Our analysis accounted for factors that mediate the
risk of importation from a source country through their effects on source strength and transport
potential. In addition, we considered the influence of the air transport network topology on the
importation risk from a source and the propensity of a destination country to receive an imported
case. Our analysis demonstrated that the co-dynamics of the connectivity indices and the network
topology explained more than 70% of the variance in dengue importation patterns. Likewise, the
topologically positioning of a focal destination county in the network, played a key role in the
importation patterns. These results contribute to our understanding of the transmission pathways
of dengue importation and the role of the dynamical processes of the air transport network.

A major focus of our study was the understanding of importation patterns of dengue in
Europe, with consideration to source strength and the characterized air transport network. Air
passengers’ data and transport connections have been used to infer relationships with imported
cases of dengue [13, 57]. However, with the growing complexity of global mobility and
transportation links, it is increasingly difficult to model importation solely on the crude aggregate
statistics of air traffic [16, 58]. Air traffic connections between source and destination account
for a fraction of required modeling parameters for general patterns of importation, other
epidemiological and anthropogenic parameters need to be accounted for. A fundamental
understanding of other mediating factors and transportation dynamics is required to achieve a
more reliable predictive model.

Our analysis addresses this by endowing each source with a specific pattern of
connectivity that mediates, its strength (risk of infection), transport and importation potential.
Source strength was the risk of infection derived from the endemicity of dengue in a source
country, distinguishing endemic and non-endemic countries. Heterogeneities in source strength
were further characterized by dengue activity and seasonality patterns in the source country. As
expected, an ongoing activity and seasonal pattern of dengue in a source country significantly
increase the transport and importation potential. Transport and importation potential were also
modelled uniquely for each source by the confluence of the various connectivity indices,
accounting for other mediating factors. This modelling approach is corroborated by other similar
studies [13, 23, 59]. With the results matching our a priori expectations, i.e. higher transport
potential for source countries with high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, lower economic
status, and geographical proximity to a destination country.

A new feature of interest in our analysis was the utilization of the infectious disease
vulnerability index as an epidemiological factor. The vulnerability index presents a robust tool
that identifies a country’s ability to limit the spread of outbreak-prone diseases [38]. The
combined multifarious nature of this index offers an intuitive understanding of the indigenous
vulnerability of a source country. For our analysis, we modelled source strength, transport, and
importation potential to increase with higher vulnerability, as expected most vulnerable countries
poses a greater risk (model 3). Although our study was focused on the earliest stages of a

network mediated epidemic, the inclusion of this index for focal destination country could
provide insights for modeling the establishment potential of an imported case of dengue. With
the assumption, that recipient countries with higher vulnerability might present greater
dissemination and establishment risk from an imported case, assuming appropriate vector
presence [60].

Our analysis went further to incorporate the dependency network approach to account for
the influence of the air transport network topology on dengue importation. Utilizing centrality
measures to quantify the influence of connection topology and the dynamical processes of the
network to influence the importation of dengue [24]. We applied two different network analysis
modelling approach, to quantify the unique contributions of each topological descriptor to
dengue importation. The first approach incorporates network autocorrelation from the source
country’s centrality measures, within the GLMM framework of the connectivity indices. The
addition of the centrality measures within the modeling framework addresses the issue of
covariance driven by the network structure. All the network descriptors were significant
predictors of dengue importation, however the combined effect of degree and betweenness
centrality were the most influential. This result suggests that source countries that are highly
connected (having multiple air routes into Europe) and act as connecting links to others countries
(large airport hubs connecting other countries), intuitively have higher transport and importation
potential, as they have the capacities to quickly connect with the wider network.

The second approach investigates if there is evidence of a correlation between the
centrality measures of a destination country and its propensity to receive an imported case. We
applied this approach as a valuable measure of a direct relationship between the air transport
network structure and dengue importation into Europe [25]. Similar to the above results, all the
network metrics were strong predictors of the variation in dengue importation. However, the
eigenvector centrality, was the most fitting single predictor, explaining over 70% variance in
dengue importation. These results suggest that the risk of dengue importation for a country (in
Europe) can be largely explained by its position in the air transport network. Meaning countries
have higher tendency for an imported case as a result of having more direct ‘one hop’
connections with high passengers traffic (as measured by degree centrality); having large airport

hubs, bridging other countries (betweenness centrality); being effectively closer to other
countries because of large passenger traffic (closeness centrality); and having multiple direct and
indirect connections to other higher connected countries (eigenvector centrality). Overall, these
results are particularly valuable in identifying countries in Europe that needs to prioritize
investment in real-time surveillance systems, as a health security measure [35, 61], due to their
increase propensity to receive an imported case.

In summary, our paper presents a refined approach to the modelling of a networkmediated epidemic for dengue fever. The connectivity indices presented here captures the
variation in source strength, transport, and importation potential, by accounting for other
mediating socio-economic and anthropogenic factors. These indices are an amenable
representation of real-world risk factors but offer a different approach for analyzing the
connectivity dynamics of network-mediated importation of dengue. Our analysis went further to
characterize the role of the air transport network topology in the dynamics of dengue importation
into Europe. By investigating the network autocorrelations influencing transport potential from
source countries and the network positioning of the destination country as a predictor of
importation. Our analyses show that the connectivity indices and dynamical processes of the air
transport network are strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe. Therefore, the network
connectivity modelling approach could be useful in predicting source countries, importation
patterns and destination countries with greater risk of dengue. Thereby, allowing for preemptive
strategies to mitigate the impacts of imported cases in a timely, accurate and cost-effective
manner [62, 63]. Finally, this modeling approach could serve as a pivotal prerequisite for the
development of an early warning surveillance system to monitor and forecast the spread of
dengue fever.
