ABSTRACT
Introduction: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by deposition of straight
filament tau aggregates in the grey matter of deep nuclei and cerebellum. White matter
changes are increasingly documented as a feature of degenerative parkinsonism. We therefore
examined the relationship between tau pathology (assessed via 18F-AV1451 positron emission
tomography) and white matter integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) in PSP.
Methods: Twenty-three people with clinically probable PSP-Richardson’s syndrome (age
68.8 ± 5.8 years, 39% female) and 23 controls underwent structural 3T brain MRI including
DTI. Twenty-one patients also underwent 18F-AV145 PET imaging. DTI group comparisons
were performed using Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD) and Radial
Diffusivity (RD). Voxel-wise white matter integrity was correlated with 18F-AV1451 binding
in typical subcortical PSP regions of interest (i.e. putamen, pallidum, thalamus and midbrain).
DTI and 18F-AV1451 imaging measures were correlated with clinical impairment.
Results: Widespread DTI changes in PSP subjects relative to controls (family-wise error
FWE p<0.01) were observed. In PSP, higher

18

F-AV1451 binding correlated with reduced

white matter integrity in the bilateral internal capsule, corona radiata, and superior
longitudinal fasciculus (FWE p<0.05). Association between cognitive impairment (ACER
score) and white matter deficits were found in the genu of corpus callosum and cingulum
(p<0.005).
Conclusion: This cross-sectional study demonstrates an association between in vivo proxy
measures of tau pathology and white matter degeneration in PSP. Longitudinal studies and
more specific PET probes for non-Alzheimer tauopathies are warranted to assess the complex
interplay between microstructural changes and protein deposition in PSP.

INTRODUCTION
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) encompasses a broad spectrum of motor, cognitive, and
behavioural impairments. These include akinesia, postural instability with early falls,
oculomotor deficits, fronto-executive dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric features such as
apathy and impulsivity 1, 2. Neuropathological studies have shown that PSP is characterized by
intra-neuronal and astrocytic aggregation of toxic microtubule-associated protein tau (of 4repeat tau isoforms, with straight filaments)

3, 4

. Using

18

F-AV1451 positron emission

tomography (PET) allows to quantify and localise in vivo tau burden. 18F-AV1451 binding is
consistently increased in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and dentate cerebellum in patients with
PSP relative to controls 5-7, mirroring the neuropathological distribution 4. Albeit 18F-AV1451
affinity for tau inclusions in non-AD tauopathies is less than in AD 8-10, and it is not specific
to tau

11

, the distribution of

18

F-AV1451 is distinct in PSP 6. Therefore, where high clinic-

pathological correlations indicate likely PSP tau pathology,

18

F-AV1451 can be used to

quantify it and compare to other disease processes such as white matter pathology.
The integrity of white matter can be assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), on the
basis of the restriction of motion of water molecules’ motion by natural ‘barriers’ such as the
axon proteins and myelin sheets. Using fractional anisotropy (FA), mean and radial diffusivity
(MD and RD, respectively), abnormal white matter has been consistently observed for PSP in
the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), as well as in the internal capsule
and fornix 12-15.
Despite the separate insights from DTI and 18F-AV1451 PET, the relationship between
tau burden and white matter degeneration in PSP has remained unknown. We therefore
directly compared DTI changes and

18

F-AV1451 binding to assess the voxel-wise and

regional associations between white matter damage and tau pathology in PSP, focusing on
subcortical nuclei. We assessed clinical correlations of both

18

F-AV1451 binding and DTI

metrics with motor and cognitive impairment. Considering the extensive white matter damage
observed in PSP in previous studies, we predicted a profound loss of microstructural integrity
related to higher

18

F-AV1451 binding, and that the severity of these changes are related to

motor and cognitive deficits.

METHODS
Participants
The present study is part of the Neuroimaging of Inflammation in MemoRy and Other
Disorders (NIMROD) protocol (Bevan-Jones et al., 2017). We included 23 participants with
probable PSP (PSP-Richardson syndrome) who were recruited according to NINDS-SPSP
1996 criteria 3 but reconfirmed as meeting the current clinical diagnostic criteria of probable
PSP-RS 2. 23 similarly aged healthy controls were also recruited, with MMSE >26/30,
absence of regular memory complaints, and no history of major neurological, psychiatric or
significant medical illness. Patients were identified from the regional specialist PSP-clinic at
the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. Healthy controls were recruited via the
Dementias and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network volunteer register. Informed
written consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study
received a favourable opinion from the East of England Ethics Committee (Cambridge
Central Research, Ref. 13/EE/0104). Clinical and cognitive assessment included MMSE and
revised Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACER), and the PSP rating scale (PSP-RS)
for PSP subjects 16.
MRI acquisition and preprocessing
Participants underwent MRI imaging acquired on a 3T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Tim
Trio) using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) T1-weighted sequence

(repetition time = 2300 ms, echo time = 2.98 ms, field of view = 240 x 256 mm2, 176 slices,
flip angle = 9°, isotropic 1mm voxels).
Diffusion-weighted images were acquired with a 65-direction encoding scheme, 2 mm
thickness, TE = 106 ms, TR = 11700 ms, field of view = 192 x 192 mm2. 64 volumes were
acquired with a b-value of 1000 s/mm2 following an initial volume with a b-value of 0 s/mm2.
The

were

with

the

software

package

(http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) using FSL Diffusion Toolbox. First, the series was adjusted
for head movement and eddy currents using eddy and realigned to the b0 image. A brain mask
was then produced by applying the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) to the (mean) b0 image.
DTIfit was next used to independently fit the diffusion tensor at each voxel, resulting in the
derivation of FA, MD and RD maps.
PET acquisition and preprocessing
21 PSP participants underwent 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging. The radioligand was prepared at
the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre (WBIC), University of Cambridge. PET scanning was
performed on a GE Advance PET scanner or a GE Discovery 690 PET/CT (General Electric
Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, USA). A 15-min

68

Ge/68Ga transmission scan was used for

attenuation correction. The emission protocol was as follows: 90 min dynamic imaging

F-AV1451 injection. Each emission image series was aligned using

acquisition

registered to the T1-weighted image to extract values from both the Hammers atlas regions of
interest (ROIs) and those in a reference tissue defined in the superior grey matter of the
cerebellum using a 90% grey matter threshold on the grey matter probability map produced
by SPM8 smoothed to PET resolution 17. Regional PET data were corrected for CSF partial
volumes.

region of interest using a basis function implementation of the simplified reference tissue
model (SRTM) 18.

Statistical analyses
Demographic data were analyzed with Stata software Version 14.2 (College Station, TX).
Assessment of distribution for continuous variables was performed with Shapiro–Wilk test
and visualization of histogram plots, followed by t test or Mann–Whitney U, accordingly.
Categorical variables were compared with Chi-Square test. Statistical significance was
considered when p<0.05.
The DTI pipeline aligned each subject’s FA image to a pre-identified target FA image
(FMRIB_58) 19. Affine registration into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) MNI152
space was performed. A mean FA image and skeleton were created from all subjects and each
individual's FA image was then projected onto the skeleton, with a threshold of 0.2 applied to
the mean skeleton in order to include white matter tracts that were common across all subjects
and to exclude voxels that may contain grey matter or CSF. The aligned DTI parameter map
of each subject was then back-projected onto the mean skeleton. In addition, other DTI
parameters (i.e., MD and RD) were aligned by applying the original FA non-linear spatial
transformations to the corresponding datasets and projecting them onto the mean FA skeleton.
Subsequently, the randomise function in FSL was implemented to identify group differences
in DTI metrics between PSP subjects and controls, using an independent sample t-test, with
age and gender as covariates of no interest.
Similarly, voxel-wise correlational models between DTI measures and average (of left and
right) 18F-AV1451 binding in specific ROIS in PSP subjects included age, gender, and disease
severity (as measured with PSP-RS) as covariates of no interest. Subcortical ROIs’

permutation testing (n=10’000 permutations), applying threshold-free cluster enhancement
(TFCE) and adjusting for multiple comparisons with family-wise error (FWE) p< 0.05

20

.

Anatomical labelling of significant TBSS white matter clusters were facilitated using the John
Hopkins – ICBM white matter atlas, available as part of the FSL package.
For PSP subjects, correlation analyses between clinical scales (ACER and PSP-RS) and
regional 18F-AV1451 BPND or DTI metrics were performed, using multiple linear regressions
correcting for age and gender. For DTI, extraction of the mean FA/MD/RD values in the
white matter tracts that showed significant deficits in PSP participants compared to controls
was performed. Bonferroni-corrected p-value (p = 0.05/n with n being the number of distinct
white matter tracts tested) was considered as significant for clinical measures and DTI
correlations.

RESULTS
Demographics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of PSP and controls participants are shown in Table
1. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, gender and education attainment. As
expected, cognitive scores (i.e., MMSE and ACER) were lower in the PSP group (p=0.01 and
p<0.001, respectively).
DTI group comparisons
Voxel-based TBSS analyses confirmed that relative to controls, PSP subjects had diffuse
white matter damage in the corpus callosum (genu, body, and splenium), bilateral internal
capsule (anterior and posterior limb), corona radiata (anterior, superior, and posterior parts),

posterior thalamic radiations, cingulate white matter, SLF, sagittal stratum, uncinate
fasciculus, and fornix (cres)/stria terminalis (TFCE p< 0.01). These abnormalities were
consistent across the three DTI metrics (i.e., decreased FA, increased MD and RD in PSP)
(Figure 1).

Voxel-wise correlation of DTI imaging and 18F-AV1451 binding
As shown in a previous publication 6, subcortical ROIs for which PSP subjects had
significantly higher

18

F-AV1451 BPND relative to controls included putamen, thalamus,

pallidum and midbrain (all p<0.02). We therefore used individual ROI

18

F-AV1451 BPND

values to assess their voxel-wise correlation with DTI imaging. For each ROI, higher

18

F-

AV1451 BPND was correlated with white matter measures (e.g., increased MD/RD or
decreased FA) in the retro-lenticular part of internal capsule, superior and posterior corona
radiata, posterior thalamic radiations and SLF (TFCE p<0.05) (Figure 2). Higher 18F-AV1451
binding in the thalamus and midbrain was associated with additional increased MD/RD and
reduced FA in the body of corpus callosum, anterior corona radiata, cingulate white matter,
fornix (cres) / stria terminalis and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (TFCE p<0.05).
Clinical correlations with 18F-AV1451 and DTI metrics
We did not find significant univariate correlations between regional

18

F-AV1451 BPND and

either ACER or PSP-RS (all p>0.2). Lower ACER score was correlated with white-matter
deficits in the genu of corpus callosum (FA: t = 3.85, p = 0.001; RD: t = -3.45, p = 0.003) and
cingulate white matter (FA: t = 3.96, p = 0.001). We did not find significant correlations
between DTI metrics and PSP-RS (all p > 0.015).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that higher 18F-AV1451 binding in subcortical regions affected
by PSP was correlated with changes in the diffusion tensor characteristics of white matter. We
interpret these correlations in terms of a correlation between tau pathology and
microstructural integrity of white matter, while recognizing important caveats below.
In comparing PSP patients with controls independently of

18

F-AV1451 binding,

extensive white matter impairment was found, including the corpus callosum, internal
capsule, corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiations, SLF, and fornix. These results are in
keeping with previous observations 12, 14, 15, which suggest a key role of white matter changes
in the pathophysiology of PSP, especially the PSP-Richardson syndrome 21.
We also observed that

18

F-AV1451 in high-binding regions for PSP (i.e. thalamus,

midbrain, putamen and pallidum) was positively correlated with increased MD/RD and
reduced FA in motor tracts (corona radiata, internal capsule), posterior thalamic radiations
and SLF, the latter being particularly involved in spatial attention, oculomotor function and
motor behaviour 22. In relation to higher 18F-AV1451 binding in the thalamus and midbrain,
we observed changes in additional white matter regions. These included the body of corpus
callosum, whose fibres pass through the corona radiata to reach the brain surface, the
cingulum (which is densely connected to the thalamus and spinothalamic tract) and superior
fronto-occipital fasciculus. These cross-modal association shed light onto the intricate in vivo
relationship between the integrity of connecting fibres and 18F-AV1451 binding. MD and RD
seem able to detect more subtle changes than FA in PSP

23-25

. However, it is still unclear

whether microstructural damage is a direct consequence of tau pathology in the white matter
(as observed post mortem) or consecutive to Wallerian degeneration.

We did not find a correlation between motor (i.e., PSP-RS) or cognitive (i.e., ACE-R) severity
and regional 18F-AV1451 binding. This is in accordance with Schonhaut et al. 7 but contrasts
with Smith et al., who found a correlation between pallidal 18F-AV1451 binding and PSP-RS
9

. One explanation could be the relatively small sample sizes or early disease stage of our

patients. In AD,

18

F-AV1451 binding in the temporal cortex was negatively related to

temporal (especially its medial portion) cortical thickness change 26. In addition, Bejanin et al.
showed that tau deposition was related in a region-specific manner to cognitive decline
That

18

27

.

F-AV1451 is a more sensitive marker of paired helical filaments than straight

filamentous might also play a role.
We did find that lower cognitive performance was significantly associated with impaired
diffusion metrics in the genu of corpus callosum and cingulum. These highlight the prominent
role of frontal dysfunction in PSP 28, 29 as both the genu of corpus callosum and cingulum are
densely connected to the frontal lobe

30

. In a previous study, Piattella et al. showed that

MMSE score in PSP was correlated with whole white matter mean FA 31.
Our study is not without limitations. First, our results would require confirmation in larger
18

F-AV1451 and white

and independent samples. Second, the present relationship between

matter integrity is based on a cross-sectional design: longitudinal studies are required to fully
assess the spatial and temporal interplay between white matter integrity and
PSP, and test causal models of pathology in humans. In addition,

18

F-AV1451 in

18

F-AV1451 off-target

binding is a caveat to our interpretation. Neuromelanin-containing cells in the substantia nigra
and monoamine oxidase in the striatum are bound by this ligand

32

. However, we recently

showed that off-target binding in basal ganglia, cortex or adjacent white matter is not
sufficient an explanation, as post mortem data did not show relevant neuromelanin-containing
cells 6. The very high clinic-pathological correlations in PSP-Richardson syndrome preclude
TDP43

11

or concurrent AD-pathology as an alternative explanation, noting that the six

patients in our study who have come to post mortem examination were confirmed as PSP
without significant dual pathology.
In conclusion, we present evidence of the in vivo association between white matter integrity
and

18

F-AV1451 in PSP. Longitudinal studies would be helpful to determine the dynamic

changes occurring for both tau deposition and microstructural integrity. Tau PET probes more
specific and sensitive for straight filaments would also enable confirmation of the complex
interplay between cortical tau aggregation, white matter tracts degeneration and disease
progression in PSP.
