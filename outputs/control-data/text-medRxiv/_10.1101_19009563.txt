ABSTRACT

67

(HBV) infection. However, therapy is not curative and long-term administration is therefore

68

required in most cases, with a risk of selecting resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). There

69

is a high genetic barrier to the selection of TFV resistance, but the distribution and clinical

70

significance of TFV RAMs are not well understood, and the topic remains contentious. We

71

here present assimilated evidence for TFV RAMs with the aim of cataloguing and

72

characterising mutations that are likely to be of most clinical significance, and starting to

73

develop relevant mechanistic insights.

74

Methods: We carried out a systematic literature search in PubMed to identify clinical, in vitro

75

and in silico evidence of TFV resistance. The structure of HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) has

76

not been solved; we therefore compared HBV RT to the crystal structure for HIV RT in order

77

to map the likely sites of RAMs.

78

Results: We identified 37 putative TFV RAMs in HBV RT, occurring within and outside sites

79

of enzyme activity, which we have mapped onto a homologous HIV RT crystal structure. Most

80

resistance arises as a result of suites of multiple RAMs. Other factors including adherence,

81

HBV DNA viral load, HBeAg status, HIV coinfection and NA dosage may also influence

82

viraemic suppression.

83

Conclusion: There is emerging evidence for polymorphisms that reduce susceptibility to TVF.

84

If clinically significant TFV resistance increases in prevalence, there will be a pressing need

85

for the development of new agents. A better understanding of HBV drug resistance is

86

imperative to ensure that these do not impact on the international elimination targets that are

87

to be met by 2030.

Background: Tenofovir (TFV) is a widely used antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus

INTRODUCTION

97

Nucleot(s)ide analogues (NA) are the most widely used antiviral treatments for chronic HBV

98

(CHB) infection (1). These agents inhibit the action of HBV reverse transcriptase (RT), acting

99

as DNA chain terminators. NA therapy can be effective in suppressing HBV viraemia, thus

100

reducing the risks of inflammation, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as

101

lowering the risk of transmission (1,2). However, NAs are not curative due to the persistent

102

intracellular hepatic reservoir of HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Long-term

103

administration is therefore required in most cases (3), with a risk of selection of resistance

104

associated mutations (RAMs) in the virus (1). RAMs are mostly likely to arise in the context of

105

high viral replication, with variants arising as a result of the error prone RT enzyme (1). NAs

106

such as lamivudine (3TC), telbivudine (LdT) and adefovir (ADV) have been largely phased out

107

of use in HBV management, mainly due to the predictable development of resistance over

108

time (1). Resistance to 3TC is best documented arising from substitutions at position M204,

109

representing the second position of the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (‘YMDD’)

110

motif in viral RT (1,4,5).

111
112

Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide analogue originally licensed for the treatment of HIV infection,

113

either formulated as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). The

114

success of TDF in CHB was first described in HBV/HIV coinfected individuals; the agent was

115

licensed for treatment of HBV mono-infection in 2008 (6,7), and remains a first-line choice

116

(2,3). There is a risk of proximal tubular nephrotoxicity, but TDF is tolerated at higher doses

117

than other NAs such as ADV (3). To further mitigate this risk, TFV can be administered as

118

TAF, which has higher plasma stability than TDF, enabling administration of lower doses to

119

achieve the same effect (8–10), Suppl Fig 1.

120
121

HBV resistance to TFV (whether administered as TDF or TAF) remains controversial. Unlike

122

other NAs, TFV has a high genetic barrier to resistance (1), corroborated by studies that report

123

no resistance after many years of treatment (11). An on-line tool, ‘geno2pheno’, that can be

124

used to call drug resistance lists only one position (N236T) in association with reduced TFV

125

susceptibility (12), while other studies have considered both N236T and A181T/V (13,14).

126

However, there are emerging reports of a wider range of amino acid substitutions in the viral

127

RT that are associated with reduced TFV sensitivity, described in both treatment-experienced

128

and treatment-naïve individuals with CHB (15,16).

129
130

There is some degree of homology between the sequence, structure and function of HIV and

131

HBV RT enzymes, explaining why certain NAs (including 3TC and TFV), are active against

132

both viruses (17–19). Studying mutations associated with TFV resistance in HIV may therefore

133

provide insights into resistance in HBV. Although no crystal structure has been resolved for

134

HBV RT, some studies have modelled this enzyme based on the HIV crystal structure (19–

135

21), suggesting that insights into HBV drug resistance mechanisms can potentially be inferred

136

from what is known about HIV.

137
138

A better understanding of the role of NA therapy in driving HBV elimination at a population

139

level is crucial to underpin efforts to move towards targets set by international sustainable

140

development goals to eliminate viral hepatitis by the year 2030 (22). CHB remains a

141

considerable global health problem given that it is a leading cause of death from liver cirrhosis

142

and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (23,24). For populations in which HIV and HBV are both

143

endemic, as exemplified by many settings in sub-Saharan Africa, there are particular concerns

144

about drug resistance in HBV, given the widespread population exposure to TDF as a

145

component of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV (22). In order to progress twoards

146

these global targets, many more people will need to be tested and treated in the decade

147

ahead. We have therefore undertaken a systematic approach to assimilate the evidence for

148

the development of clinical or virological HBV breakthrough during TFV therapy, with the

149

specific aim of collating all the currently available evidence for TFV resistance.

150
151
152
153

METHODS

154

We undertook a systematic search of PubMed and Scopus in February 2019, using PRISMA

155

criteria (Suppl Fig 2). We used the search terms (“Hepatitis B virus” [Mesh] OR "hepatitis b"

156

OR HBV) AND (Tenofovir OR TDF OR TAF OR “Tenofovir alafenamide” OR “Tenofovir

157

Disoproxil Fumarate”) AND (resista* OR drug muta* OR DRMs OR RAMs). We reviewed the

158

titles and abstracts matching the search terms and included those reporting virological HBV

159

breakthrough after exposure to TFV, only including studies that presented original data and

160

had undergone peer review. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool

161

checklist (25) to assess for quality of case reports. For assessment of quantitative studies, we

162

used the BMJ quality assessment tool (26).

Search strategy

163
164

Sequence analysis

165

To assess similarity between HIV and HBV RT, we downloaded HIV and HBV reference

166

sequences from publicly available HIV (27) and HBV (28) sequence databases. We aligned

167

amino acid RT sequences using MAFFT version 7 (29). The alignment illustrates regions of

168

similarity and differences between HIV and HBV RT. We obtained RAMs associated with HIV

169

resistance to TFV from Stanford University HIV drug resistance database (30).

171

Structural analysis

172

The crystal structure for HBV RT has not been solved, However, the enzyme is homologous

173

to HIV RT. In order to further assess the list of 37 RAMs, we therefore considered evidence

174

for a mechanistic influence by mapping HBV RAMs onto a previously solved crystal structure

175

of HIV RT (PDB code 3dlk (31)) using ICM [http://www.molsoft.com/icm_pro.html].

176
177

RESULTS

178

Nature and quality of the evidence identified

179

We identified 15 studies that met our search criteria. Seven studies were case reports

180

(15,16,32–36), four were in vitro studies (37–39) and four were longitudinal studies of CHB

181

(with or without HIV coinfection) (40–43). Studies were from Asia (15,16,32,34,39), Australia

182

(43), Europe (33,36,38,40–42) and USA (35,37,44). Eight studies reported HBV genotypes,

183

representing genotypes A-G (16,32,35–37,40–42,44). Metadata for individual studies are

184

provided in Suppl Table 1.

185
186

A detailed quality assessment of each individual reference is included in Suppl Table 2.

187

Among the case reports, three were of high quality as they clearly described patients’

188

characteristics, clinical history, current clinical condition, diagnostic tests or assessment

189

methods, interventions or treatment procedures, post-intervention clinical condition, and

190

concluded with take away lessons (32–34). Three further case reports did not describe

191

diagnostic test or assessment methods (15,35,36), and one study did not describe post-

192

intervention clinical condition of the participant (16). The overall quality rating for four cohort

193

studies was strong because participants selected represented the target population,

194

characteristics of participants were clearly described, there a clear hypothesis for the study,

195

and inclusion/exclusion criteria were specified (40–43). Two studies had a weak rating

196

because there was no description of the characteristics of study participants and it was not

197

clear whether participants were representative of the target population (37,44). Two natural

198

experimental studies were not rated because the quality assessment questions were not

199

applicable (38,39).

200
201

Approach to defining resistance

202

Resistance was studied based on exposure to TDF in 13 studies and TAF in two studies; we

203

therefore refer to TFV throughout the results section. TFV resistance was determined using

204

a range of strategies, which can be summarised as follows:

205

i.

A sequencing approach to identifying possible RAMs in HBV sequence isolated from

206

individuals in whom viremia was not suppressed by TFV therapy, undertaken in seven

207

studies (15,32,34–36,40,43);

208

ii.

209

In vitro assays to measure the effect of TFV on viral replication in cell lines, reported
by three studies (37,38,44);

210

iii.

Approaches (i) and (ii) in combination, applied in four studies (16,33,41,42);

211

iv.

Approach (ii) combined with an animal model, described by one study (39).

212
213

In 12/15 studies, HBV mutations were reported in association with TFV resistance or reduced

214

TFV susceptibility (16,32,33,36–42,44). In the remaining three studies, persistent viraemia

215

was reported among individuals with chronic HBV infection while on TFV but either no RAMs

216

were identified (35,43) or viral sequencing was not performed due to low viral load (34).

217
218

Location and number of RAMs associated with TFV resistance

219

In total, 37 different sites of polymorphism were reported, arising both within (n=15) and

220

outside (n=22) enzymatically active sites in RT (Fig 1; Suppl Table 3). HBV mutations outside

221

active sites of the enzyme occurred in combination with RAMs located within active sites (with

222

the exception of A194T). Only two studies (33,38) reported TFV resistance arising from the

223

selection of a single mutation, S78T and A194T. RAM S78T was defined by sequencing HBV

224

from two individuals in whom vireamia was not suppressed by TDF, combined with in vitro

225

assays (33), while A194T was only defined in vitro (38). In all other studies, ≥2 RAMs were

226

required to confer TFV resistance (2 RAMs in four studies (37,39,40,44); 3 RAMs in one study

227

(42); 5 RAMs in one study (16), and ≥8 RAMs in a further four studies (15,32,36,41). This

228

pattern supports the high genetic barrier to selection of TFV resistance.

229
230

We narrowed the list of 37 sites down to compile a list of TFV RAMs that have been identified

231

in ≥2 studies, regarding these sites as having the strongest evidence base (9 sites; Table 1).

232

The most frequently described RAMs were L180M (32,41,42), A181T/V (37,40,41,44),

233

M204I/V (16,32,41,42), and N236T (37,40,44). Among these, the M204 mutation (within the

234

‘YMDD’ motif) is well established in association with 3TC resistance, commonly arising in

235

combination with substitutions at positions V173, L180 and A181, while N236 substitutions

236

are more specifically associated with reduced susceptibility to ADV and TFV (13). Mutations

237

at sites 177, 194 and 249 may also be more specific to TFV resistance, having been less

238

clearly reported in association with resistance to other agents (45–47). Polymorphisms at

239

positions 80,173, and 184, have been described as compensatory changes to allow the virus

240

to accommodate the primary drug escape substitution (13).

242

Some reported polymorphisms associated with drug resistance represent wild type sequence

243

in some genotypes (Y9H, F122L, H126Y, R153W/Q, F221Y, S223A, C256S, D263E, V278IV

244

and A317S), and our assimilation shows more resistance in genotype D (Suppl Table 4). Most

245

of these polymorphisms are located outside the active site of the enzyme, with the exception

246

of position 256. The barrier to selection of TFV resistance may therefore be lower in certain

247

genotypes, (Fig 1, Suppl Table 4).

248
249

One study assessed the replication competence and susceptibility to TFV of mutated HBV

250

clones in vitro and in vivo using mice models. The introduction of P177G and F249A mutations

251

(substitutions in active sites of the RT enzyme) in HBV clones, resulted in a reduction in their

252

susceptibility to TFV (39).

253
254

RAMs occurring as minor quasispecies

255

There is limited evidence for the significance of TFV RAMs occurring as minor quasispecies.

256

One study that performed ultra-deep pyrosequencing enrolled HIV/HBV co-infected

257

individuals on (or about to start) TFV-containing ART, reporting minor variants present at

258

<20% with mutations (V173, L180M, A181T/V and M204V) in 2/50 TFV naïve samples and

259

1/14 sample obtained from a TDF-experienced individual (43). One other study performed

260

deep sequencing using Illumina on HBV clones (16), revealing that RAMs S106C, H126Y,

261

D134E, M204I/V & L269I were predominant. Only one study reported sequencing the whole

262

HBV genome, but this was undertaken following in vitro introduction of RAMs into a clinically

263

isolated virus (44), so does not provide any evidence of the association between TFV RAMs

264

and other polymorphisms that might arise on the same viral haplotype.

265
266

Duration of therapy and treatment compliance prior to detection of tenofovir resistance

267

Five studies reported the duration in which individuals were on TFV prior to treatment failure,

268

with virological breakthrough occurring between 48 weeks and 48 months of therapy (48

269

weeks (32), 18 months (34), 20 months (41), 26 months (16), and 48 months (15,33)).

270

Compliance was assessed in six studies, among which virological breakthrough despite good

271

treatment compliance was reported in five (16,32,34,41,42), and one reported concerns with

272

compliance (36). Quantification of drug levels in plasma supported good compliance in two

273
274

studies (16,41).

275

Comparison between HIV and HBV RT

276

HBV RT has been classified into subdomains (termed ‘finger’, ‘palm’, and ‘thumb’) which are

277

further divided into conserved regions annotated A – G (17), which form the main catalytic

278

core of the enzyme (Fig 1). We investigated the similarity between the RT enzyme in HBV and

279

HIV, demonstrating 25-27% homology between different HBV genotypes and the HXB2 HIV

280

reference sequence (Fig 2). We aligned amino acid RT consensus sequences to compare

281

sites that have been reported in association with drug resistance in HBV vs HIV (Fig 3, Suppl

282

Table 5). Of the 37 sites with RAMs identified in HBV RT, two sites had identical amino acid

283

substitutions to RAMs in HIV RT (M204 and L229 in HBV (19,21,48), corresponding to M184

284

and L210 in HIV, respectively (30,49), Fig 3). Other sites reporting an association with TVF

285

resistance in HBV have substitutions that overlap with HIV RAMs, but not all of these are

286

associated with TFV resistance, Suppl Table 5.

287
288

Six established TFV RAMs in HIV RT (M41L, K65R, K70E, Y115F, Q151M and T215F/Y) (30)

289

do not correspond to an equivalent mutation in HBV RT, although three of these HIV RAMs

290

have an HBV RAM within 3 amino acids up- or down-stream in the equivalent sequence,

291

suggesting there may be homology in the mechanism through which drug resistance is

292

mediated.

293
294

We mapped HBV RAMs onto the crystal structure of the likely structurally-related HIV RT (pdb

295

code 3dlk) in order to visualise their approximate 3D locations and infer possible functional

296

consequences (Fig 4) (Suppl Table 6). The RAMs are primarily located within the ‘fingers’,

297

‘palm’, ‘thumb’ and ‘connection’ subdomains of the p66 polymerase domain of HIV RT (31),

298

with the majority within the ‘palm’. A number of RAMs (e.g. V207, M204, F249) are spatially

299

adjacent to the catalytically critical (and highly conserved) residues D110, D185 and D186 in

300

HIV RT (D83, D204 and D205 in HBV), suggesting that these RAMs are highly likely to

301

affected catalytic competency. Twenty-two RAMs map to HIV RT residue positions which, if

302

mutated, are likely to cause structure destabilisation, suggesting that many of these RAMs are

303

likely to impact upon resistance.

DISCUSSION

306

TFV is a safe and effective treatment choice for CHB in the majority of cases. However, we

307

have assimilated evidence of cases in which reduced TFV susceptibility has been

308

demonstrated either by persistent viraemia and/or reduced in vitro susceptibility. Based on

309

existing evidence, most TFV resistance arises as combinations of suites of mutations (most

310

commonly including L180M, A181V/T, M204I/V and/or N236T), overlapping with RAMs that

311

allow escape from other NA drugs. There is also a suggestion that, rarely, single mutations

312

can confer TFV resistance, which is currently best demonstrated for S78T. Notably, the

313

literature to date is limited and heterogenous, and there remains a lack of evidence about the

314

frequency and likely impact of proposed TFV RAMs either within individual patients or at

315

population level.

316
317

Algorithms to report TFV resistance

318

Assays and software tools that have been designed to determine genotype and drug

319

resistance may bias against detection of relevant mutations, if they do not provide read-outs

320

for all the relevant sites that contribute to reducing TFV susceptibility. For example,

321

‘TRUGENE’ captures common HBV RAMs but does not include positions 78, 177, or 249

322

which may be pertinent to TFV resistance (50) and geno2pheno only lists one TFV mutation

323

at position 236 (12).

324
325

Overlap of TFV RAMs with RAMs to other NA agents

326

RAMs L180M, M204I/V and A181T/V have been associated with resistance to 3TC, LdT and

327

ETV (14,47,51–53); their reported association with TFV resistance is of concern in suggesting

328

that prior NA exposure can increase the likelihood of cross-resistance to TFV. A study of

329

HIV/HBV co-infected individuals previously demonstrated a decreased likelihood of HBV DNA

330

suppression with TDF among individuals exposed to prolonged 3TC treatment, possibly due

331

to accumulation of such mutations (7). A large study in China reported finding mutations at

332

one or both A181 and N236 in 11% of the population (14). which may underpin reduced

333

susceptibility to TFV. The structural similarities between ADV and TFV, and similar interaction

334

with HBV polymerase (1,3) explain why the ADV RAMs A181T/V and N236T are also reported

335

to confer resistance to TFV (1,54,55).

336
337

Although TFV has been considered effective (and may be used as salvage therapy) in the

338

context of resistance to other NAs (56,57), the current evidence we have undoubtedly

339

suggests that the shared mechanisms of action may lead to increasing TFV resistance (58).

340

There is some evidence showing co-location of RAMs conferring resistance to different

341

antiviral agents on the same viral haplotype (59), although this study did not specifically assess

342

TVF resistant variants. These findings suggesting cross-resistance are of concern, especially

343

for many settings in sub-Saharan Africa, where there has been widespread use of NA therapy

344

(especially 3TC) as a component of ART (47).

345
346

Sites of TFV RAMs in HBV RT

347

Resistance to TFV can be explained by RAMs both within and outside the active site of the

348

RT enzyme, some of which may have similar mechanisms to those described in the equivalent

349

HIV enzyme (17–19). In evolutionary terms, selection of RAMs is a trade-off for the virus,

350

offering escape from drug-mediated suppression but being potentially detrimental to viral

12

351

fitness or replicative capacity if they are associated with structural or functional changes.

352

Mutations outside the enzyme’s active sites may incur lower costs to viral fitness as they are

353

less likely to interfere with the RT function. The mechanism of resistance in most of these

354

polymorphisms remains unknown but may interfere with drug access to sites of activity

355

through steric hindrance. Other changes may represent compensatory mutations, that are

356

selected to optimise structure and function of the molecule in the presence of primary RAMs.

357

For example, substitution at position 269 has been previously described as a compensatory

358

mutation that, when selected together with RAMs to 3TC and ETV, restores impairments to

359

function of the RT enzyme (60).

360
361

TFV resistance may be associated with specific HBV genotypes; given that C256S has been

362

linked to TFV resistance and is a wild type sequence in genotype C, (Suppl Table 4). This

363

could suggest that the genetic barrier to TFV resistance in genotype C is lower than in other

364

genotypes. However, a study of >1000 individuals in China found no differences in drug

365

resistance rates between Geno-B vs Geno-C infection (14). Currently, genotyping is not

366

routinely undertaken in clinical practice, so it is difficult to amass data for any potential

367

relationship between clinical (phenotypic) resistance and viral genotype. More data are

368

required to enhance an understanding of the relationship between resistance and HBV

369

genotypes.

370
371

Other factors associated with persistent vireamia

372

In addition to RAMs, there are other explanations for incomplete suppression of HBV viraemia

373

on therapy, supported by reports of phenotypic resistance in the absence of any known RAMs

374

(35,43). Factors associated with persistent HBV DNA viraemia on TDF treatment include a

375

higher baseline HBV DNA level (7,61,62), positive baseline HBeAg status (61), prior history

376

of 3TC exposure (7), a lower nadir CD4+ T cell count in the context of HIV coinfection (7,63)

377

and high serum HBV RNA levels (64). Given that HBV DNA is inhibited in a dose-dependent

378

manner (3), it is also possible that insufficient drug delivery to the infected hepatocyte could

379

be the cause of persistent viraemia even in the absence of specific RAMs. These diverse

380

phenomena make it difficult to be certain of a clinical (phenotypic) definition of drug resistance

381

and may confound studies that set out to identify viral sequence (genotypic) variants that are

382

genuinely associated with altered TFV susceptibility.

383
384

Incomplete adherence to drug therapy can also contribute to virological breakthrough (65).

385

Two studies included in our review assessed treatment compliance by measuring drug

386

concentration in plasma (16,41). Studies assessing treatment adherence in chronic HBV have

387

also used questionnaire-based approaches (66–68), but these are subject to bias as self-

13

388

reporting of compliance may be inaccurate. Evidence of potential TFV resistance may emerge

389

when individuals with HIV/HBV coinfection are treated with a TFV-containing regimen leading

390

to suppression of HIV but with sustained HBV vireamia (69). Plasma, PBMCs and dried blood

391

spots have been useful in assessing drug concentration in HIV infection (70–74), however,

392

they only offer information on treatment exposure over a short period (typically 7-14 days)

393

(74). Hair samples have been used as an alternative way to measure drug residue in some

394

studies (74–76); this is an appealing option given that collection is generally acceptable, non-

395

invasive, and provides information on treatment exposure over weeks to months (74).

396

However, to date we have been unable to identify any evidence that this method has been

397

applied to quantify drug levels in HBV infection.

398
399

The time to virological breakthrough on TFV treatment ranged from 48 weeks to 48 months in

400

the studies we identified. A previous study reports a long time line of three years before ~90%

401

of HBV infected individuals on TFV therapy demonstrate viraemic suppression (77,78). It is

402

striking that TDF suppression is slow in HBV compared to HIV, in which 88% of patients

403

supress the virus within the first year of treatment with a TDF based regimen (79). In the

404

studies we have reported in this review, persistent HBV viraemia on therapy could be due to

405

the slow and variable timeline for viraemic suppression; however, in most studies there was a

406

reduction in viral load when TDF was initiated, with subsequent virological breakthrough that

407

is more in keeping with the selection of resistance.

408
409

Implications for patient management

410

There are not currently sufficient data about TFV RAMs to underpin robust universal

411

guidelines for clinical practice. However, it is undoubtedly the case that a greater body of

412

sequencing data, together with contemporaneous viral load measurements, is required in

413

order for us to advance understanding of the relationship between viral sequence and

414

outcomes on therapy. In the context of failure of viraemic suppression in a patient prescribed

415

therapy, assessing and supporting drug compliance is crucial. If viraemia persists despite

416

adherence to treatment, sequencing should be advocated in order to explore the potential for

417

RAMs. Therapeutic failure of TFV – whether in the presence or absence of known RAMs –

418

should lead to an expert clinical decision about switching therapy or combining agents, for

419

which there is currently limited guidance. If resistance continues to emerge, there will be a

420

need for expert guidelines to include practical recommendations in order to unify clinical

421

approaches. In the longer term, evidence of TFV resistance calls for the development of robust

422
423
424

novel direct acting antivirals and immune therapies for HBV.
Caveats and limitations

425

There is sparse literature on HBV resistance to TFV, and studies are of varying quality.

426

However, by assimilating these data, we have been able to present a better picture of the

427

most likely candidate RAMs. While there is a high genetic barrier to selection of TFV

428

resistance, it is likely that there is under-reporting of cases of resistance, particularly in

429

low/middle income settings in which routine monitoring of HBV VL on treatment is not

430

undertaken. The lack of studies reporting on TDF resistance in Africa reflects the lack of

431

routine diagnostic screening for HBV and/or inadequate routine monitoring of those on

432

treatment (47,80). It can be difficult to infer the impact of common polymorphisms on drug

433

resistance phenotype; for example, it is plausible that M204I/V may be enriched among TFV

434

resistant strains simply as a ‘footprint’ of prior exposure to 3TC.

435
436

Most studies to date have used Sanger sequencing, and it is possible that significant minority

437

variants may be under-represented, as suggested by one report in which phenotypic TFV

438

resistance was associated with RAMs in <20% of minor variants (43). Low HBV DNA viral

439

loads are a further barrier to sequencing, and bias existing data towards samples from

440

individuals with high viral loads, in which the full spectrum of relevant RAMs may not occur. It

441

is therefore important to invest in deep sequencing platforms that offer the opportunity to

442

explore the full landscape of HBV variants isolated from an infected individual, and to improve

443

sensitivity of sequencing methods including both Sanger and ‘next-generation’ approaches.

444

Sequencing methods that can generate long reads, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies,

445

can generate long reads that allow reconstruction of complete viral haplotypes, providing

446

improved certainty about linkages between sites (81).

447
448

We recognise the limitations of drawing direct comparisons between HIV and HBV RT, given

449

the limited (<30%) sequence homology between the two enzymes, and the finding that only

450

2/37 sites associated with TVF resistance in HBV are homologous RAMs in HIV. This

451

highlights a need for future work to solve the crystal structure of HBV RT. Understanding the

452

consequences of combinations of polymorphisms is an important aspiration. To be able to

453

undertake an appropriate haplotypes analysis would require datasets with robustly

454

phenotyped patients (displaying clinical evidence of drug resistance) together with full length

455

viral sequence data; such datasets have not been generated to date but are an important long-

456

term aim.

457
458

Conclusions

459

We have assimilated emerging evidence for HBV RAMs that reduce susceptibility to TFV, also

460

acknowledging the potential influences of other viral and host factors in cases of persistent

461

viraemia on therapy. While the genetic barrier to resistance is high, evidenced by the large

462

number of mutations that typically have to be selected to produce resistance, of concern is the

463

overlap with other NA resistance mutations, and the instances in which individual amino acid

464

polymorphisms may be sufficient to produce phenotypic resistance. Enhanced studies

465

representing larger numbers of patients, tracking longitudinal viral sequence changes, and

466

monitoring viral suppression over time are needed. In addition, the evolution of better in vitro

467

models will support experiments to investigate the effect of individual and combined RAMs. In

468

order to optimise the use of NA therapy as a tool in driving advancements towards elimination

469

at a population level, improved insights into drug resistance are essential. If resistance

470

emerges as a substantial clinical problem, there will be a need for consideration of synergistic

471

drug regimens, new agents that inhibit a target other than viral RT, and for the development

472

of new therapeutic strategies that can bring about cure.
