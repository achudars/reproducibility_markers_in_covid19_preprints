ABSTRACT
Background: There is growing recognition that recent global increases in obesity are the product of a
complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. However, in gene-environment studies
of obesity, ‘environment’ usually refers to individual behavioural factors that influence energy balance,
while more upstream environmental factors are overlooked. We examined gene-environment
interactions between genetic risk of obesity and two neighbourhood characteristics likely to be
associated with obesity (proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and availability of physical activity
facilities).
Methods: We used data from 335,046 adults aged 40-70 in the UK Biobank cohort to conduct a
population-based cross-sectional study of interactions between neighbourhood characteristics and
genetic risk of obesity, in relation to BMI. Proximity to a fast-food outlet was defined as distance from
home address to nearest takeaway/fast-food outlet, and availability of physical activity facilities as
the number of formal physical activity facilities within one kilometre of home address. Genetic risk of
obesity was operationalised by 91-SNP and 69-SNP weighted genetic risk scores, and by six individual
SNPs considered separately. Multivariable, mixed effects models with product terms for the geneenvironment interactions were estimated.
Results: After accounting for likely confounding, the association between proximity to takeaway/fastfood outlets and BMI was stronger among those at increased genetic risk of obesity, with evidence of
an interaction with polygenic risk scores (P=0.018 and P=0.028 for 69-SNP and 91-SNP scores,
respectively) and in particular with a SNP linked to MC4R (P=0.009), a gene known to regulate food
intake. We found very little evidence of a gene-environment interaction for availability of physical
activity facilities.
Conclusions: Individuals at an increased genetic risk of obesity may be more sensitive to exposure to
the local fast-food environment. Ensuring that neighbourhood residential environments are designed
to promote a healthy weight may be particularly important for those with greater genetic susceptibility
to obesity.

BACKGROUND
Obesity has a heritable component,[1] but the rapid rise in global obesity prevalence suggests an
important role for environmental influences.[2] However, individuals may have differing physiological
or behavioural responses to the increasingly ‘obesogenic’ environment, suggesting that a complex
interplay between genetic and non-genetic factors affects weight.[3,4]
Advances in genotyping technologies have enabled the investigation of gene-environment (GxE)
interactions.[4,5] For obesity outcomes, the ‘environment’ in GxE studies is often operationalised as
the lifestyle or behavioural factors that influence energy balance,[6] rather than more upstream features
of the built and social environments; the settings where behavioural ‘choices’ are made and constrained.
Some recent studies have examined interactions between genetic risk and birth cohort as a means of
capturing exposure to an increasingly obesogenic environment in very broad terms,[7–9] but there has
been limited investigation of specific features of the environment that might plausibly interact with
genetic risk,[10–14] despite a number of ‘socio-ecological’ environmental factors long being
recognised in social epidemiology as potentially important determinants of weight status.
The residential neighbourhood environment comprises many features that potentially influence energy
balance. These include the proximity, density and relative proportions of healthy and unhealthy food
retailers,[15–17] and resources for physical activity (PA), such as leisure centres, swimming pools,
gyms and sports fields.[18–21] Other neighbourhood features linked to energy balance include
walkability, access to public transport and local resources such as public parks and greenspace.[22,23]
If the genetic risk of obesity modifies the influence of these neighbourhood exposures, we would expect
to observe differential effects of the residential environment on body mass index (BMI) according to
level of genetic risk. The influence of the environment may be strongest in people with high genetic
risk due to increased sensitivity to external factors,[24,25] or it may be strongest in people with low
genetic risk, who maximise their genetic ‘advantage’ within a healthier environment while those at
greater risk express a higher BMI phenotype regardless of environmental factors.[6]
In this study we use the UK Biobank cohort to examine whether genetic risk of obesity modifies the
effect of two residential environment exposures likely to influence BMI: proximity to fast-food and
availability of formal PA facilities. We operationalise genetic risk in two ways. First, using polygenic
risk scores derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to BMI, and second, using the
individual SNPs most strongly linked to BMI and thought to be involved in diet or PA pathways.

METHODS
Data
We used baseline data from UK Biobank.[26] Data were potentially available from 502,656 individuals
who visited 22 UK Biobank assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Individuals
aged 40–69 years living within 25 miles of an assessment centre and listed on National Health Service
(NHS) patient registers were invited to participate.
Linked to UK Biobank is the UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform (UKBUMP), a highresolution spatial database of objectively measured characteristics of the physical environment
surrounding each participant’s residential address, derived from multiple national spatial datasets.[27]
Environmental measures include densities of various land uses and proximity to various health-relevant
resources. Measures for the current study are available for 96% of the UK Biobank sample.
Genome-wide genetic data are available for 488,363 participants. Genetic data are missing from 3% of
the sample as insufficient DNA was extracted from blood samples for genotyping assays. SNP
genotypes not directly assayed were imputed. Procedures used to derive the genetic data and undertake
quality assurance are reported in Bycroft et al.[28] Genetic data for the relevant SNPs were downloaded,
decrypted and linked to participant IDs to facilitate analysis.
Outcome
Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated from weight and height measurements collected by
trained staff using standard procedures.[26] The variable was normally distributed and analysed as a
continuous outcome variable.
Neighbourhood exposures
We examined interactions between genetic risk and two neighbourhood characteristics likely to
influence BMI: availability of formal PA facilities (number of indoor and outdoor sporting and leisure
facilities within a one-kilometre street-network distance of an individual’s home) and fast-food
proximity (distance in metres to nearest takeaway/fast-food outlet). Greater neighbourhood availability
of PA facilities may influence BMI through increased opportunities for physical activity, and greater
distances from home to fast-food outlets may influence BMI by reducing access to fast food.[29,30] In
prior analyses we found both were associated with BMI in the expected direction – that is, living further
from a fast-food outlet, or having more PA facilities near home, was associated with having a lower
BMI.[18] Both exposures were analysed as continuous variables, with higher values of each (more
facilities; greater distance to nearest fast-food outlet) representing lower exposure. Due to the positively

skewed distribution of these variables, number of PA facilities was capped at 15 (<1% recoded from
>15) and distance to nearest fast-food outlet was log transformed (base 10) such that regression
coefficients were interpreted as the mean difference in BMI associated with a 10-fold increase in
distance to nearest fast-food outlet e.g. 100 metres to one kilometre.
Genetic risk scores and individual SNPs
A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 97 SNPs associated with BMI.[31] We
constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 91 of these SNPS, excluding six SNPs identified
elsewhere[32] as being in linkage disequilibrium with other included SNPs (rs17001654, rs2075650
and rs9925964) or having pleiotropic effects (rs11030104, rs3888190, rs13107325), both of which may
produce bias in associations between the genetic risk score and the outcome, and in interaction
analyses.[33] We also constructed an alternative GRS, the same as one by used Tyrrell and
colleagues[32] in a study of UK Biobank participants of White British ancestry, in which they tested
interactions between genetic risk and behavioural exposures using a GRS derived from 69 of the SNPs
identified in the recent GWAS. Their GRS excluded SNPs from secondary meta-analyses of studies of
regional, sex-stratified or non-European-descent populations,[31] and one SNP (rs2033529) that was
unavailable at the time of their study. Full lists of the SNPs included in each of the 91-SNP and 69-SNP
risk scores are provided in Supplementary Table 1. The GRSs were constructed by summing the number
of BMI-increasing alleles across the set of 69 or 91 loci, and weighting the allele count at each SNP by
its published effect size.[31] For imputed SNP genotypes we used the imputed allelic dosages.
From the literature we identified individual SNPs with a well-established link to obesity and the largest
published effect sizes (rs1558902 rs6567160 rs13021737, markers of the FTO, MC4R and TMEM18
genes respectively),[1,31] and three SNPs recently linked to physical activity (rs13078960, rs10938397
and rs7141420, markers of CADM2, GNPDA2 NRXN3).[34,35] We tested for interactions between the
number of BMI-increasing alleles at each of these loci, and each neighbourhood variable. We
hypothesise that if GxE interactions are observed for these SNPs, those SNPs implicated in dietary
behaviour will only interact with the fast-food environment, and those implicated in PA behaviour will
only interact with the PA environment.
Covariates
Models were adjusted for potential confounding by age, sex, educational attainment, household income,
employment status, area deprivation (Townsend score), urban/non-urban status, and neighbourhood
residential density and mutually adjusted for the other neighbourhood exposure. We also corrected for
population stratification by adjusting for the first ten of 40 UK Biobank-provided genetic ancestry
principal components from a genome-wide PCA of UK Biobank’s genetic data.[28]

Statistical analysis & analytic sample
Accounting for the nested structure of the data (individuals within assessment areas), we used mixed
effects models with a random coefficient for the neighbourhood exposure and assuming an unstructured
variance/covariance matrix. Models included an interaction term between the neighbourhood exposure
and the genetic risk score, with both analysed as continuous variables. BMI difference per unit change
in the exposure was estimated for each quintile of genetic risk. The p-value for the additive interaction
term was interpreted as strength of evidence of effect modification. The marginal predicted values of
BMI associated with different levels of each neighbourhood exposure from these models were plotted
for the top and bottom quintile of genetic risk, to visualise observed effect heterogeneity according to
genetic risk. A complete case analysis was used, restricted to UK Biobank participants of White British
ancestry (defined by concordant self-report and PCA results for White British/Caucasian ancestry) for
the primary analyses because the smaller GRS was limited to SNPs associated with BMI in analyses of
individuals with European ancestry. The sample size for the primary analysis was 335,046. Analysis
was performed using Stata SE v14.2.
Sensitivity analyses
As the 91-SNP GRS included SNPs associated with BMI in populations of non-European descent, we
undertook a sensitivity analysis that tested for an interaction with the 91-SNP GRS in a sample
unrestricted by ethnicity to test generalisability to the wider source population. To explore the
possibility that results might be biased by latent genetic structure in the sample – a concern regarding
genetic analyses involving UK Biobank[36] – we also performed sensitivity analyses in which models
were adjusted for all 40 genetic ancestry principal components, and for birth location. Finally, although
weighting of the polygenic risk scores is appropriate due to the varying degree to which each SNP is
associated with BMI, we performed sensitivity analyses using an unweighted version of each GRS.
Evidence of a GxE interaction using unweighted scores is expected to be weaker, due to dilution of the
effects of the more influential SNPs.
Ethics
UK Biobank has ethical approval from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee
(reference 16/NW/0274), the Patient Information Advisory Group (PIAG), and the Community Health
Index Advisory Group (CHIAG). Additional ethical approval for the specific study was obtained from
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s Research Ethics Committee in September 2016
(reference 11897).

RESULTS
The sample was 52.2% female, with a mean age of 56.5 years (range 40-70 years at baseline). Mean
BMI was 27.4 kg/m2 (SD=4.7), median distance to nearest fast-food outlet was 1171 metres and median
number of PA facilities within one kilometre of home was one. Sample characteristics are summarised
in Table 1.
Using the two alternative weighted genetic risk scores, we observed evidence of an interaction between
fast-food proximity and genetic risk (P=0.028 for the 91-SNP GRS, P=0.018 for the 69-SNP GRS). The
magnitude of the estimated effect between fast-food proximity and BMI was small at all levels of
genetic risk, but increased as genetic risk increased. In the highest quintile of genetic risk of obesity
(based on the 91-SNP GRS), each 10-fold increase in distance to the nearest fast-food store was
associated with a 0.194kg/m2 lower mean BMI (95%CI: -0.326,-0.062), which was twice the magnitude
of association in the lowest risk quintile (β=-0.081; 95%CI: -0.213,0.052) (Table 2; Figure 1).
There was less evidence that the association between availability of PA facilities and BMI was modified
by genetic risk. The magnitude of the association between number of formal PA facilities within 1km
of home and BMI was similar at all levels of genetic risk, and while effect estimates did increase slightly
with increasing genetic risk, differences between risk groups were small with weak evidence of
interaction for both the 91-SNP GRS (P=0.530) and 69-SNP GRS (P=0.178). For both environmental
exposures, the results obtained from the two different weighted GRSs were substantively similar, but
evidence of an interaction with the 69-SNP GRS was somewhat stronger (Table 2; Figure 1). The plots
in Figure 1 also demonstrate that the BMI difference between the highest and lowest risk quintiles is
greater for the 91-SNP GRS than the 69-SNP GRS, reflecting the fact that the larger GRSs captures
more of the genetic variation in BMI.
Examination of interactions between neighbourhood variables and specific SNPs revealed strong
evidence of one interaction: with the marker of MC4R, which encodes the melanocortin-4 receptor
previously shown to be important in the regulation of food intake. Among people homozygous for the
high risk allele at the marker of MC4R, each 10-fold increase in distance to the nearest fast-food store
was associated with a 0.258 kg/m2 lower BMI, compared with only a 0.096 kg/m2 difference per 10fold increase in distance among people with no risk alleles at this locus ((Pinteraction=0.009, Table 3;
Figure 2). Some evidence of an interaction between fast-food proximity and rs1558902, the marker of
the FTO gene (P=0.067), where again the higher risk group showed a stronger association between fastfood proximity and BMI. We also observed some evidence of a GxE interaction between the availability
of PA facilities and rs13021737 (in the TMEM18 gene) (P=0.076). In this case, increased genetic risk
attenuated the association between availability of PA facilities and BMI (Figure 2).

In sensitivity analyses, interactions between fast-food proximity and genetic risk were – as expected –
weaker when the genetic risk scores were not weighted by the effect sizes of the component SNPs, with
mean differences in BMI more similar across levels of genetic risk than we observed using the weighted
score (Supplementary Table 2). Expanding the sample to include non-White ethnicities, we observed
slightly increased P-values for the interaction terms but otherwise no substantive difference from the
primary analysis (Supplementary Table 3). For all models, the impact of adjusting for 40 rather than 10
genetic ancestry principal components was negligible, while some attenuation of the interaction
between fast-food proximity and polygenic risk occurred when adjusting for birth location
(Supplementary Table 4).

DISCUSSION
In UK Biobank we found evidence that genetic risk of obesity modifies sensitivity to the neighbourhood
food environment, though effects are small. We found that people at higher genetic risk of obesity have
higher average BMI the closer they live to a fast-food outlet, whereas for those at low genetic risk of
obesity, distance to the nearest fast-food outlet does not appear to be associated with BMI. In contrast,
an overall negative association between neighbourhood availability of PA facilities and BMI varies very
little across levels of polygenic risk.
The observed gene-environment interaction for fast-food proximity using polygenic risk scores was
supported by stronger evidence of an interaction between fast-food proximity and a specific SNP near
MC4R, a gene known to be involved in regulation of food intake[37]. Previous research has linked
MC4R specifically to binge eating[38] although this remains contested.[39] We also observed some
evidence of a possible interaction with a SNP marker of FTO, a gene with well-established links to
obesity. While FTO has long been recognised as an obesity-associated locus, and has been implicated
in central nervous system regulation of appetite, its exact function remains poorly understood.[1] In a
study of gene-diet interactions, genetic risk scores for BMI were found to be associated with fried food
consumption, and, consistent with our results, individual loci in or near both MC4R and FTO
contributed to this.[40]
Limited evidence for an interaction between genetic risk and the PA environment is consistent with
findings from a recent study in adolescents that found that availability of recreation facilities did not
contribute to the attenuation by PA of genetic risk of obesity.[34] While overall genetic risk of obesity
did not interact with the PA environment in our study, the weaker association we observed between the
availability of PA facilities and BMI in those with more risk alleles at the TMEM18 locus suggests that
some specific SNPs might. Further examination of other SNPs is warranted. Lack of interaction with
specific SNPs might be explained by the pathways they influence being less sensitive to environmental

exposures. As the functional pathways by which most BMI-associated loci influence BMI remain
poorly understood, it is difficult to speculate further.
Stronger evidence for interactions with specific SNPs highlights the lack of specificity of polygenic risk
scores. While useful in exploratory studies, grouping all SNPs statistically associated with a complex
phenotype such as BMI into a single score, regardless of the function of the genes they represent, may
dilute or obscure important interactions. Scores based on known or putative biological mechanisms may
prove more valuable, particularly for elucidating causal relationships. We observed very similar results
for both the 69-SNP and 91-SNP genetic risk scores, although the smaller GRS yielded stronger
evidence of interaction. It may be that the additional SNPs in the larger GRS diluted the interaction due
to being associated with BMI only in some population subgroups, and some having been linked to BMI
only in more ethnically diverse populations than our primary sample.
We have reported elsewhere that the main association between fast-food proximity and BMI in UK
Biobank may be attenuated due to measurement error in the exposure,[18] and because the exposure
does not account for other, healthier elements of the food environment.[41] Compared with other
measures of the fast-food environment, proximity measures may also produce more conservative
estimates of association with relevant outcomes.[42] In a regional sub-sample of UK Biobank, others
have recently improved on this measurement of the food environment and found stronger
associations.[43] In this study, where the main effect sizes are relatively small, even the reasonably
strong interaction effects we observed translate to small differences between high and low risk groups.
However, given the likely measurement error and the distal and complex nature of the relationships
under investigation, detecting even weak associations and small differences might point to potentially
important processes. Other studies have reported evidence of a GxE interaction between genetic risk of
obesity and birth cohort[7–9], with this interpreted as evidence that recent increases in the
‘obesogenicity’ of our environments increases the susceptibility of those with a genetic predisposition
to become obese. Here we examined two characteristics of neighbourhood environments likely to be
obesogenic; but others may also interact with genetic risk. For example, GxE interactions have recently
been reported for neighbourhood walkability and obesity,[13] and neighbourhood deprivation and
BMI.[12] Given that unhealthy characteristics of neighbourhoods often cluster together,[44] the
combined effects of multiple ‘obesogenic’ features on those at increased genetic risk of obesity may be
substantial.
Our findings provide evidence for a potentially important GxE interaction, but further confirmatory
studies are required. Another recent study found a strong GxE interaction between genetic risk of
obesity and socioeconomic status, and while our analyses are adjusted for several socioeconomic
indicators, if there remains any residual confounding by SES it may be contributing to the GxE

interactions we observed. Geographical genetic structure in the sample remains a risk, even after
adjustment for ancestry components and geography. Such structure may induce spurious associations
with polygenic risk scores in particular.[36] In sensitivity analyses we found that adjustment for
additional ancestry principal components had negligible impact on the strength of evidence for the GxE
interactions we tested, but evidence for a genetic interaction with fast-food proximity was slightly
weaker following adjustment for birth location. Further investigation of the effect of the residual genetic
structure in the sample is warranted. GxE interactions are also sensitive to the scaling of environmental
variables, and the power to detect a GxE interaction can depend on the main effect sizes, and distribution
and measurement quality of the genetic and environmental variables.[45] Studies using UK Biobank
are also at risk of selection bias due to a low response rate.[46] It is important these analyses are
replicated in other samples at lower risk of these biases.
It is widely accepted that environmental factors are important in explaining the recent rise in the global
prevalence of overweight and obesity. In this study, we find evidence that people at higher genetic risk
of obesity may more sensitive to exposure to the residential fast-food environment. Ensuring that
neighbourhood residential environments are designed to promote a healthy weight may be particularly
important for those with genetic susceptibility to obesity.
