Abstract
Recent debate has focused on the significance of platelets generated in lung tissue. Here, we
retrospectively analyzed platelet count changes in neonates requiring inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)
pulmonary vasodilation therapy for pulmonary hypertension. There were no clinically significant
changes in platelet count upon iNO initiation or during iNO therapy. Unexpectedly, platelet
counts increased after iNO cessation. These findings argue against a clinically meaningful
untapped pulmonary repository of megakaryocytes and platelets in this context, although acute
platelet count increases might be expected after discontinuing iNO in some patients. Further
work is needed to clarify the underlying etiology for these observations, and to better delineate
the mechanisms for platelet count increases after recovery from lung injury.

Introduction
Thrombocytopenia, platelet count below 150 x109 per L, results from inadequate production or
increased consumption of platelets. Thrombocytopenia affects up to 35% of all NICU patients,
including up to 90% of very low birth weight neonates (Gunnink et al, 2014). Donor-derived
platelet transfusions are frequently given empirically to prevent bleeding in thrombocytopenic
infants. The optimal platelet transfusion threshold is a point of contention, with wide clinical
practice variations (Sparger et al, 2015). Importantly, platelet transfusions increase morbidity
and mortality in preterm infants (Curley et al, 2018). These findings highlight a need to
anticipate clinical scenarios that might permit more judicious use of platelet transfusions.
Traditionally, platelets have been thought to derive from precursor megakaryocytes in bone
marrow (Elagib et al, 2018). However, some platelets are generated from megakaryocytes that
have migrated to the lung (Lefrançais et al, 2017; Zucker-Franklin & Philipp, 2011). The clinical
significance of lung-derived platelets remains a matter of debate.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) can severely diminish pulmonary blood flow and is
frequently encountered in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). PH often results from
persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), meconium aspiration syndrome, or
abnormal lung development from congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), omphalocele, or
pulmonary hypoplasia. Acute severe neonatal PH can be treated with mechanical ventilation,
direct pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and/or extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO). PPHN and idiopathic PH are associated with
thrombocytopenia (Mojadidi et al, 2014; Le et al, 2019).
We aimed to determine whether increased pulmonary blood flow in the setting of PH treatment
affects platelet counts. Infants with severe PPHN have had diminished pulmonary circulation in
their lifetime, with relatively naïve pulmonary vascular environments in which to study the effects
of acute changes. Clinical scenarios in which neonates develop severe PH often include
independently risk factors for thrombocytopenia, including sepsis (Guida et al, 2003). While this
complicates parsing a clear association of PH and platelet counts, we reasoned that the rapid
(seconds to minutes) effects of iNO would permit temporal correlation (Dupuy et al, 1992). In
contrast, slow temporal changes in platelet counts are more likely derived from bone marrow
production, as normally occurs over time during infancy (Sparger et al, 2015).

Methods
Subject identification
Subjects were identified via retrospective review of laboratory and clinical data from admissions
to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from 2010-2018. Inclusion criteria were admission at
<28 d of age and receiving iNO. All infants that met these clinical inclusion criteria in our NICU
would be expected to have clinically significant pulmonary hypertension. Indeed, most of these
infants carried a formal diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in their medical record. Excluded
were subjects who received platelet transfusions or were treated with ECMO, as these are
independent factors that would independently elevate or decrease platelet count, respectively.
Those with diagnoses of CDH, pulmonary hypoplasia or omphalocele were excluded from our
primary patient cohort. Those with CDH, who typically have abnormal lung parenchyma, were
considered as a separate subpopulation.
To achieve adequate subject numbers without sacrificing specificity for the acute changes
induced by iNO, we considered subjects for whom complete blood counts (CBCs) were
available within 48h prior to iNO initiation and within 48h following iNO discontinuation. We also
included results from time periods during iNO therapy, specifically within 48h after starting iNO
and within 48h before stopping iNO. We focused on platelet counts, using red blood cell (RBC)
and white blood cell (WBC) counts as control indices. We grouped up to 5 laboratory values
within each time frame to obtain a best estimate of the average blood count values.
Respiratory severity score (RSS) correlates well with oxygenation index in neonates (Iyer &
Mhanna, 2013). RSS is calculated by multiplying the fraction of inspired oxygen by mean airway
pressure in mechanically ventilated subjects, and was used as a surrogate marker of pulmonary
response to iNO. This was used in favor of oxygenation index, since in many instances the
arterial partial pressure of oxygen was unknown.
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism 8 was used to calculate statistics and to generate graphs. Statistical
significance was defined as a p-value less than 0.05 in all tests.
We analyzed laboratory values using mixed effects analysis and Tukey’s multiple comparison
tests, given that some subjects did not have blood counts obtained in the analyzed time points
during iNO therapy. Linear regression analysis determined best fit lines for temporal trends.
Ethics
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Review Board deemed this study exempt
from review.

Results
We retrospectively identified infants admitted to our quaternary care NICU at <28 d of age who
were treated with iNO and had at least one complete blood count (CBC) performed in the 48h
prior to initiating iNO and within 48h after stopping iNO (Table 1). The average duration of iNO
therapy in this cohort was 22.7 d. We excluded those who required therapies that would
confound endogenous platelet measurements, such as ECMO or allogeneic platelet
transfusions. Our initial analysis also excluded patients with pulmonary hypoplasia, including
those with omphalocele and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). We considered as a
separate population those patients with CDH, to assess whether abnormal lung development
might alter platelet count responses to iNO.
We began by assessing platelet count surrounding iNO initiation. Platelet count did not change
in the setting of iNO initiation (Fig. 1A, ‘Pre’ vs ‘Start’), despite a significant decrease in
respiratory severity scores reflecting improved pulmonary vascular dynamics upon iNO initiation
(Fig. 1B). Platelet counts remained stable yet mildly depressed for the duration of iNO therapy.
Unexpectedly, upon iNO discontinuation there was an acute increase in platelet count in this
cohort (Fig. 1A, ‘Post’). We were surprised by the magnitude of change, with platelet count
increasing by 50% or an average of 114 x109 per L compared to pre-iNO treatment levels
(239±89 pre-iNO vs 353±220 x109 per L post-iNO initiation, mean±SD). As comparators, white
blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts remained stable during all analyzed time
periods (Fig. 1C-D).
The observed trends in platelet counts, as well as respiratory severity scores and other blood
cell counts, were consistent in those with CDH (Supplementary Fig. 1). Of note, there was a
trend toward increased platelet count toward the end of iNO therapy that did not reach statistical
significance (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
Temporal analyses confirmed that there were no clinically meaningful changes in platelet count
in the first 7 d of iNO treatment for these patient cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 2). At minimum,
these analyses confirm that platelet count does not acutely increase at the onset of pulmonary
vascular dilation in the setting of iNO initiation.

Discussion
Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 x109 per L) is frequently encountered in the NICU
(Gunnink et al, 2014) and has been associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow (Mojadidi
et al, 2014; Le et al, 2019). Allogeneic platelet transfusions are standard therapy to increase
platelet count, but increase morbidity and mortality in NICU patients (Curley et al, 2018).
Pulmonary hypertension of is also frequently encountered in the NICU, and large randomized
controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of iNO in facilitating pulmonary vasodilation
(Barrington et al, 2017). These studies have not focused on platelet count trends in the setting
of PH or iNO therapy.
Of patients meeting inclusion criteria for our study, 37% (31/84) had thrombocytopenia prior to
iNO treatment, and almost half (46%) received a platelet transfusion. Infants who received
transfusions had significantly lower platelet counts prior to iNO initiation (152±94 x109 per L,
mean±SD) compared with those who did not receive transfusions (239±89 x109 per L). Hence,
neonates with pulmonary hypertension are at significant potential risk for complications
associated with thrombocytopenia and its treatment.
Bone marrow-derived platelets take about 7 days to form from stem cells, whereas pre-formed
megakaryocytes in the lung might be expected to yield platelets substantially faster. In our
cohort, platelet counts did not significantly change following iNO initiation. It is possible that
these findings were confounded by dilutional changes related to fluid resuscitation in these
critically ill patients, but we would have expected RBCs and WBCs to also fall if this were the
case. Alternatively, even minimal pulmonary blood flow in infants with PH might be sufficient to
promote platelet elaboration from lung megakaryocytes. Overall, however, bone marrow
megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis seem primarily responsible for increased platelet counts
seen over time for infants with normal or abnormal lung parenchyma.
We were surprised to see a marked increase in platelet counts following iNO termination. The
observed platelet count increase was clinically significant, in similar magnitude to increases
seen following 10-15 ml/kg platelet transfusions (Kline et al, 2008). Despite historical concern
surrounding reduced platelet function in the context of iNO, there has been no correlation
between iNO therapy and bleeding (Barrington et al, 2017). Biochemical studies suggest that
nitric oxide may acutely increase platelet production by promoting megakaryocyte apoptotic
mechanisms (Battinelli et al, 2002), but over time this might be expected to cause an overall
decrease in megakaryopoiesis and/or thrombopoiesis. It is also possible that this change
reflects a reactive thrombocytosis following resolution of lung injury, as seen in patients with
sickle cell disease (Villagra et al, 2007). Further studies are needed to address specific iNO
effects that could alter thrombopoiesis in our patient cohort.
In summary, PPHN predisposed our cohort to relative thrombocytopenia that improved once
iNO therapy was discontinued. The lack of correlation between pulmonary blood flow and
platelet counts suggests that lung-resident megakaryocytes are not a significant untapped
reservoir for platelets for this population, at least in the context of PPHN and/or critical illness.
However, acute platelet count increases might be expected following iNO discontinuation for
some infants. These findings could ultimately help inform empirical platelet transfusion
decisions, but it will be important to investigate and confirm these trends in larger cohorts.
