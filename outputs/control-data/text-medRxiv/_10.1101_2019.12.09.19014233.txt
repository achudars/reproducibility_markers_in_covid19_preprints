Abstract
High-frequency longitudinal tracking of inflammation using dried blood microsamples provides a
new window for personalized monitoring of infections, chronic inflammatory disease, and clinical
trials of anti-inflammatory drugs. Using 1,662 dried blood spot samples collected by 16 subjects
over periods of weeks to years, we studied the behavior of 12 acute phase response (APR) and
related proteins in inflammation events correlated with infection, vaccination, surgery, intense
exercise and Crohn’s disease. Proteins were measured using SISCAPA mass spectrometry and
normalized to constant plasma volume using low-variance proteins, generating high precision
within-person biomarker trajectories with well-characterized personal baselines. The results shed
new light on the dynamic regulation of APR proteins and offer a new approach to visualization of
multidimensional inflammation trajectories.

Introduction
In this paper we explore the longitudinal behavior of inflammation-related acute phase
response (APR1) proteins in a unique collection of dried blood spot (DBS) samples. These included
1,522 samples collected longitudinally by eight individuals over periods of up to nine years (with
extended periods of daily sampling) and 140 samples collected by eight elite athletes at multiple
time points per day during one week of Olympic training using a Sportomics approach [1]. Using
peptide-based SISCAPA immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry (SISCAPA-MS) and a novel
optimized plasma volume normalization method, we measured the scale and temporal
relationships between inflammatory proteins and the frequencies of large and small changes from
personal baselines. We also developed novel means for visualizing this rich data.
Inflammation is central to the understanding of human health and disease. Underlying the
classical definition (heat, pain, redness, and swelling), inflammation involves a complex balance
between protective and destructive processes implemented by a varied cast of proteins under active
regulatory control. In clinical contexts, these complex processes are usually summarized by
measuring only a single blood biomarker: C-reactive protein (CRP [2]), a key component of the
innate immune system involved in recognizing and destroying bacterial pathogens. Enormous
clinical value has been obtained through quantitative measurement of CRP, as reflected by the fact
that there are more FDA-cleared commercial tests for CRP than for any of the >100 other clinically
measured blood proteins. CRP levels have well-established clinical significance over a very wide
dynamic range, from small (less than 2-fold) increases associated with increased cardiovascular
disease risk [3] to increases of more than 100-fold in major infections [4]. Considered more
broadly, increases in CRP are associated with negative developments in a wide range of health

situations, including infection [5], arthritis [6], surgery [7], intense exercise [8], sleep apnea [9],
depression [10], air pollution [11], welding fume exposure [12], Parkinson’s disease [13],
pregnancy [14], inflammatory bowel disease [15] and various cancers [16], to name a few
examples.
Many therapeutics that reduce inflammation are in use or under development. These
usually act either directly (by targeting inflammation pathway signaling) or indirectly (by treating
causes of inflammation). Inflammation signaling is generally targeted by biologics, including a
wide and rapidly growing range of molecules such as the anti-TNF alpha antibodies infliximab
[17] and adalimumab [18]; TNF inhibitor etanercept [19]; anti-IL-6 mAbs siltuximab [20] and
olokizumab [21]); anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab [22]; anti-IL-1β mAb canakinumab [23]; and IL1 receptor antagonist anakinra [24]. ISIS 329993, an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to
the coding region of the human CRP messenger RNA, directly targets CRP translation [25]. A
similarly wide spectrum of small molecules target causes of inflammation, including antibiotics
(such as teicoplanin [26], vancomycin [27] and cefuroxime [28]), various statins [29], the COX/5LOX inhibitor tenidap [30], methotrexate [31], the Lp-PLA2 inhibitor darapladib [32], and the
MAPK inhibitor dilmapimod [33]. All of these drugs reduce CRP levels, and in fact CRP has been
used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in trials of many of them as a means of selecting dose and
dosing schedule [18,19,21–23,31]. CRP thus carries a heavy load in measuring inflammation,
both in terms of diagnostic evaluation and in the assessment of treatment efficacy.
Can a single biomarker adequately summarize such complex mechanisms and outcomes?
The current use of CRP as a biomarker implicitly assumes that inflammation can be considered a
fixed response [34] to many disparate triggers, following the same basic script in all individuals.
In reality, the inflammatory response exhibits wide variations in scope and timing, as well as major
differences between individuals. At the molecular level, it involves significant changes in the
concentrations of many proteins besides CRP, including cytokines (short-lived, low-abundance
signaling proteins that regulate inflammatory responses [35]) and a broad set of acute phase
response (APR) proteins [36] that implement many of the functions required to recognize and deal
with inflammatory stimuli. The cytokines, including primary inflammation regulators such as
interleukin-6 (IL-6), are of central importance in research on regulatory mechanisms, but are only
occasionally used as clinical diagnostic tests because of their short half-lives, localized pleotropic
effects and very low concentrations (low pg/mL). APR proteins like CRP, on the other hand,

represent the systemic effects of cytokine regulation and have longer half-lives, a wide range of
specific effector functions and higher concentrations. Differences among APR proteins in terms
of their regulation, half-lives and functions imply that each has the potential to contribute
additional non-redundant diagnostic information, which in turn suggests that a panel of APR
proteins would have greater sensitivity and power than CRP alone in analyzing inflammatory
responses. In this paper we explore that concept using a set of twelve APR and APR-related
proteins in blood, each with distinct roles and behaviors. These include clinically-established
molecules involved in both innate (SAA, CRP, LPSBP, MBL; see Table 2 for complete list of
protein abbreviations) and adaptive (IgM) immune responses, as well as proteins involved in drug
transport (Alb, A1AG), iron scavenging and transport (Hp, Hx), the complement cascade (C3),
coagulation (FibG) and neutrophil activity (MPO). High precision measurement of protein panels
in DBS is achieved by mass spectrometry combined with a sample preparation workflow involving
stable isotope standards and capture by anti-peptide antibodies (SISCAPA [37–39]). From an
informatics viewpoint, this breadth of analysis increases the functional dimensionality of
inflammation measurement, giving a clearer picture of what is happening at any moment in time.
Tracking biomarker changes through time completes the biological picture.
Concentrations of various inflammation markers change over timescales ranging from minutes to
years, exposing associations with a variety of underlying time-dependent disease mechanisms and
contextual variables. For this reason, longitudinal studies of serial blood (plasma, sera) samples
provide the clearest path to detailed understanding of the dynamics of inflammatory processes
needed to distinguish specific causes, guide therapy, predict outcomes and account for differences
between individuals. In medicine, longitudinal sampling allows interpretation of results against
personal baselines for each protein, thereby personalizing diagnostic interpretation. Such an
approach exposes relationships between biomarkers over time, potentially uncovering novel
diagnostic multi-parameter indices.

In pharmaceutical trials, longitudinal sampling allows

construction of mathematical models relating the changing levels of a drug in vivo
(pharmacokinetics; PK) to changes in one or more biomarkers of effect (pharmacodynamics (PD);
together referred to as PK/PD models). However, since frequent longitudinal blood sample
collection by venipuncture is generally impractical outside a medical environment (and generally
discouraged for ethical reasons, including the associated reduction of subject hematocrit [40]),

longitudinal sample collections rarely include more than a 5-10 samples per individual. Thus highfrequency (e.g., daily) sampling is rarely attempted, even in clinical trials.
Longitudinal sample collection can be radically improved by using a less intrusive means
of blood collection: fingerprick capillary blood dried on filter paper (“dried blood spots”: DBS).
DBS have been used as clinical samples since the pioneering studies of Guthrie [41] on inborn
errors of metabolism in neonates. As practiced routinely by diabetic patients, individuals can
collect capillary blood by lancet fingerprick several times each day for glucose measurement
without injury or undue discomfort, blood that can be collected and stored in the form of DBS by
subjects themselves. Numerous efforts are now underway to further improve the user-friendliness
and reproducibility of capillary blood collection that will further enable the approach described
here.
Here we report results that illustrate the complex and informative behavior of APR proteins
(and related proteins) in tracking inflammation due to multiple causes. The data demonstrate the
potential for major improvements in diagnostic test interpretation using personalized baseline
values and the feasibility of personalized multiparameter biomarker response models useful in
clinical trials.

Results
Amounts of selected APR and related proteins were measured using an automated,
multiplexed SISCAPA-MS protocol [37,39] and normalized to a consistent plasma volume using
a personalized approach based on a combined index of three proteins (Alb, Hx, IgM) whose levels
are generally very stable in an individual over time (i.e., they exhibit low within-person variance
[39]). The calculated scale factors applied to individual longitudinal DBS spots in this study fell
in the range of 0.7-1.3 as expected. This volume normalization substantially reduces longitudinal
baseline “noise” in measurements from an individual: Supplementary Figure 1A shows DBS
protein levels before and after normalization in 250 serial samples collected by subject S-04 over
almost 5 years.
In addition to maintaining stable levels over time, two of the normalizing proteins (Hx and
IgM) exhibit large quantitative baseline differences between individuals. As a result, each
subject’s sample set, in many cases including hundreds of samples collected over many years,
forms a tight cluster on a plot of Hx vs IgM, almost completely separated from the other subjects
(Figure 1A). In general, points diverging from the cluster centroids are associated with major
inflammation events. Subjects S-04 and S-18 (of opposite sex, contributing 411 and 250 samples
respectively) share a living environment, while their sample sets appear as completely separated
clusters, indicating that most of this between-subject variation is not determined by environment
at the time of collection. Most of the other APR proteins measured showed significant interindividual differences as well (Supplementary Figure 2).
While the selected normalizing proteins exhibit striking longitudinal stability, we
nevertheless observed two significant sources of variation in these proteins within subjects. Figure
1B shows small (+/- 10%) systematic changes in three proteins in three subjects that correlate with
average ambient temperature on the date and location where the samples were collected, an effect
previously noted in the form of seasonal variation in some DBS analytes [39]. In addition, as
shown in Supplementary Figure 1B, extreme inflammatory events such as major infections affect
the concentrations of most plasma proteins to some degree, including those used here for
normalization. With the present approach, normalization bias due to inflammation is mitigated
due to the fact that while IgM varies little, Alb shows a weak negative APR and Hx shows a weak

positive APR, so that the combined index is to a great extent balanced with respect to
inflammation.
Inflammation events
The largest perturbations observed in levels of most proteins occurred during inflammatory
events that were noted by the study subjects and were coincident with increases in the acute phase
reactants CRP (Fig. 1C) and SAA. However, many events were observed that appear to be “subclinical”: in the five subjects for which extended (>150) longitudinal sample series were available,
we identified 57 inflammation events in which CRP was increased significantly above baseline
levels in multiple samples collected over a brief interval, allowing identification of a temporal
maximum (colored spikes in the CRP time series presented in Fig. 1C). Of these events,
approximately half (29 events) included at least one sample in which CRP was increased by more
than 10-fold above baseline and all events were confirmed by coordinated increases in CRP, SAA
and LPSBP. In contrast to the large increases seen in SAA and CRP in these events, the remaining
APR proteins (LPSBP, A1AG, Hp, MBL, FibG, C3 and Hx) showed much smaller effects
(Supplementary Figure 1B), with fold-increases relative to baseline ranging from 0.036 (LPSBP)
as great as the fold-increase in CRP to 0.002 (Hx).
Given the significant fraction of samples that showed evidence of an inflammatory
response, we defined personal “normal” baseline levels for each biomarker protein based on the
subset of samples with CRP below a cutoff equal to the personal median CRP value across all of
a subject’s samples; i.e., selecting the half of each subject’s samples with lowest CRP values. For
each protein, the median value in these low-inflammation baseline samples was taken as the
subject’s personal baseline. The standard deviation in these baseline samples allowed calculation
of a personal baseline CV. The average baseline CV over all subjects, samples and proteins was
12.3% (12.4%, 17.0% and 10.2% in Datasets A, B, and C respectively) compared to 38.0% (39.2%,
68.7% and 31.3% in Datasets A, B, and C) for combined baseline and non-baseline (i.e., all)
samples (Supplementary Table 3). On average, the ratio of assay CV (from replicate standards) to
average subject baseline CV (from subjects’ longitudinal samples) was 0.52, satisfying the
criterion (<0.6) allowing statistically meaningful analysis of within-subject biological variation
[43] at very low levels of inflammation. In subject S-22, CRP and SAA showed maximum
increases of up to 497- and 1,062-fold (equivalent to 2,673 and 3,688 personal standard deviations)
respectively, above personal baselines in a major kidney infection, illustrating the >1,000-fold

dynamic range of statistically significant (>2 SD) within-person changes. The proportion of
samples in which CRP was more than 2-fold higher than the personal baseline ranged from 1245% among these 5 subjects (Supplementary Table 2).
Infection
Infections of various kinds constituted the major driver of inflammation events. Figure 2A
shows time course plots for 7 significant infections occurring in 5 subjects, each involving SAA
increases >100-fold from personal baseline median values. These events were reported by subjects
as: respiratory infection (S-01 E7; i.e., event 7 in subject S-01); respiratory infections (S-04 E2,
E3 and E8); food poisoning (S-10 E11); pneumonia confirmed by X-ray (S-18 E6); and kidney
infection (S-22 E2). Subject S-18, with the largest sample series, exhibited a number of discrete
events (Fig. 1C) in addition to S-18 E-6 that were subject-annotated as “nose colds” and have a
remarkably consistent magnitude and structure, likely indicating a reproducible response to similar
infectious agents (e.g., rhinoviruses). None of the infections required hospitalization, though in
some cases antibiotics were administered.
The ratio of SAA over CRP (each in terms of fold-change from personal baseline median;
Figure 2B) shows large changes through the course of each infection. SAA induction exceeds
CRP induction at the peak of each event, while it appears that CRP exceeds SAA before and after
the peak.
Influenza vaccination
Two subjects collected daily samples in periods that included a vaccination against
influenza (Fluzone™ high dose 2017). Inflammatory responses (Figure 2A; S-04 E10 and S-18
E20) in SAA and CRP were measurable (1.3 – and 2.2-fold increases in SAA from respective
personal baselines), but were ~100 x smaller than those associated with major infections. Of the
57 identified inflammation events, 41 involved SAA increases larger than 2.2-fold (i.e., a greater
response than seen with either of these 2 vaccination events).
Surgery
Subject S-04 underwent elective anterior total hip arthroplasty involving a short (~2 hr)
surgical procedure and subsequent recovery period of 97 days during which daily (or more
frequent) samples were collected (Figure 2C). Following an initial rapid rise after surgery,
inflammation markers (here plotted on two log scales, left and right, differing by 20-fold in

magnitude), declined at different rates until day 55, at which point the levels approached a new
baseline approximately 50% below the pre-surgery level. CRP and SAA were induced much more
strongly than other inflammation indicators (with maximum inductions of 113- and 136-fold
respectively). The magnitudes of the observed responses (in fold-change from personal baselines)
were: SAA > CRP >> LPSBP >FibG, Hp, A1AG > MBL, C3 > Hx (136, 113, 5.4, 3.0, 2.9, 2.7,
2.0, 1.8, and 1.2-fold respectively), overall a ~500-fold range of response magnitudes relative to
personal baselines. In the period between days 8 and 30, a series of post-surgical jumps in SAA
and CRP (e.g., days 9, 18 and 22) indicated renewed inflammatory activity that generally coincided
with increased requirement for pain medication (Figure 2D) and subject reports of strains in the
surgical area, followed by smooth declines to baseline. Figure 2C also includes an infection event
(an upper respiratory tract infection perceived by the subject as a “nose cold”) on day 62 following
surgery. While the overall magnitude of the inflammation response in this infection was roughly
10% as great as the response to surgery, the kinetics of the early response of the 5 proteins shown
were similar.
Figure 2E shows the time course after surgery of nine acute phase proteins normalized to
the same peak response (0-100%) and smoothed in order to reveal relative peak times. LPSBP
achieved its peak level first (~1.2 days post-surgery), followed by SAA, CRP, A1AG and MBL,
Hp , FibG , Hx and C3, with the last peaking approximately 5 days post-surgery.

Crohn’s disease
A combination of rapid APR protein changes superimposed on a slow declining trajectory
were observed in subject S-10, who has Crohn’s disease and has diligently explored dietary and
other measures to control symptoms. Over a period of ~2.5 yr, CRP and SAA levels were
substantially elevated on numerous occasions (Figure 3A shows the entire time period consisting
of almost 2 yrs of weekly samples followed by 180 daily samples shown expanded in Fig 3B).
Overall, CRP was above 2 times the median personal baseline value in 48% of the individual’s
samples, a significantly higher proportion than exhibited by the other subjects. The subject made
careful notes of perceived Crohn’s attacks (reported on a scale of 0.5-2 in intensity at times
indicated in Fig 3); “colds” (labeled “C”) and one episode attributed to food poisoning (“FP”). It
is noteworthy that three of eight recorded Crohn’s attacks occurred at times of lowest CRP (150,

460 and 800 days from first sample), while the rest coincide with CRP peaks. Conversely, at least
eight CRP peaks of magnitude equal to those linked to Crohn’s attacks are not noted by the subject
as either Crohn’s attacks or infections. Over the period of sample collection, S-10 reported success
in significantly reducing the frequency and intensity of gut inflammatory events and this was
reflected in the significant downward trend in CRP and SAA, reduced intensity of CRP spikes and
a progressive decline of almost 3-fold in Hp, a slowly-responding acute phase protein.
Fig. 3C shows results from weekly samples (Thursdays) extracted from the daily sample
set shown in Fig. 3B. Weekly sampling gives a significantly different picture of inflammation
activity than the daily samples in this case, consistent with the short timespan of most Crohn’s
flares in subject S-10.
Intense exercise
The most rapid APR protein changes observed were the result of intense physical training,
in this case using dried venous blood samples from elite Brazilian beach volleyball athletes during
a week of Olympic training. Four samples were collected on each training day: Figure 4 shows
longitudinal changes in 4 teams (1-4) of two athletes (A and B) training together over the course
of 4 training sessions and 2 subsequent recovery samples later in the week. Hp decreased
significantly during training sessions, presumably due to complexation with Hb released through
RBC hemolysis associated with violent muscle contraction [44], declining by a total of ~10-60%
among the 8 athletes by the end of session 4, and then recovering to normal levels 3 days later.
Myeloperoxidase (MPO; reflecting the neutrophil count) increased by ~10-100% during training
sessions and rapidly returned to baseline [45], exhibiting large differences between athletes. CRP
and SAA were not strongly affected during training sessions, though SAA appeared to decrease in
most athletes during the 4 days of training. There were, however, several specific events indicating
inflammatory responses from other sources: athlete A of team 3 (A3) began the week with CRP
and SAA strongly elevated, and both declined according to typical half-lives.

Athlete 4B

experienced a large increase in neutrophils (MPO) during the first training session, followed by
the largest observed CRP increase the following day, suggesting a potential injury (though none
was noted by the coaches). While the overall pattern of Hp and MPO responses to intense training
was consistent, individual athletes differed significantly in the magnitude of these changes.

Figure 5A shows a protein:protein correlation matrix calculated over all 1,522 samples
from subjects in sample set I after volume normalization and division by personal baseline median
values (to minimize the impact of between-subject differences in protein amount). The positive
APR proteins showed significant correlations overall as expected, with the highest pairwise
correlations occurring between proteins with similar time signatures (Figure 3E): thus CRP and
SAA (both fast APR’s) show a pairwise correlation of 0.89; A1AG and Hp (both slow APR’s)
correlate at 0.84. CRP and Hp (fast vs slow responses) showed a correlation of only 0.49. Alb
and IgM showed strong negative correlations with the positive APR proteins, consistent with their
known roles as negative APR markers. The 3 normalizing proteins Alb, Hx and IgM also exhibited
strong negative correlation with each other, as expected given their collective balancing role in the
volume normalization process.
Non-linear regulation
Figure 5B explores the correlation of CRP with SAA and LPSBP in more detail using
log:log plots in samples that are above (blue) and below (orange) personal median CRP levels for
the 5 subjects with large sample numbers. During inflammatory events, where CRP varies by up
to ~100-fold, the SAA response was consistent across subjects, increasing by up to 1,000-fold
over baseline in major infections. LPSBP levels increased in a similar pattern, but the observed
increase was less than 10-fold at maximum. The strong relationships evident in the blue samples,
while appearing linear in log:log format, are, in fact, non-linear (best-fit here by exponential
relationships). This is confirmed in the set of events (Figure 5C) in which a local maximum SAA
timepoint was determined (i.e., for which samples were available with lower levels just before and
after a maximum), which shows that SAA’s maximum induction relative to baseline exceeds
CRP’s for the highest-level events, but CRP generally achieves higher levels of induction than
SAA for the smaller events. This non-linear relationship can be modeled by an exponential fit in
which SAA is related to CRP raised to a power between 1.31 and 1.52, except for subject S-10 for
which the power is 1.75.
Figure 5B also reveals significant correlations between CRP and SAA or LPSBP in the
half of each subject’s samples (orange) with lowest CRP (i.e., in the baseline low-inflammation
data). Such persistent correlations among proteins in what could be considered baseline samples
demonstrate that small changes in APR proteins represent real biological signal
(“microinflammation”), not simply noise in pre-analytic and analytic steps.

Visualization of inflammation responses and recovery
Differences in timing between earlier and later-peaking inflammation markers suggest an
improved method for visualizing an inflammatory response trajectory as loops in two dimensions,
starting at baseline, through injury and returning to baseline [46]. Figure 6A shows 3 such event
trajectories in one subject (S-04) visualized by plotting SAA (fast response, up to 439-fold above
baseline on a log scale) vs. Hp (slow response, maximum at 5.3-fold above baseline, also on a log
scale) in successive DBS from the respective events. These events include a “deep cough with
earache” (S-10 E2; red), as well as the hip replacement surgery (S-10 E8; green) and “nose cold”
(S-10 E9; blue) events shown in Figure 2C. The largest magnitude event (cough) reaches
maximum response at days eight and nine after first increase, while the much smaller response to
a cold reaches maximum in three-four days. Response to the comparatively short two hr surgical
intervention peaked in two-three days, and proceeded through initial healing (day eight), followed
by a period of re-inflammation (days 10-27; coincident with increased use of pain medication) and
recovery to baseline (day 86; blue).
The same approach can be applied (Fig 6B) to visualize three subjects’ complete
inflammation trajectories presented in Figure 1C. In these plots the identified inflammation events
are drawn in colors, while the samples constituting baseline are shown in green. Subjects S-04 and
S-18 each experienced a number of inflammation loops (all associated with infections except S04 E7 (surgery). Subject S-10 (Crohn’s) has a different distribution of measurements, with only a
single major infection (E11) and a wider range of Hp variation due to the progressive decline of
this marker during the 2.5 yrs of sample collection.

Discussion
Here we present a high-resolution multi-dimensional molecular picture of inflammation
events and personal baseline biomarker levels in 16 individuals, combining dense longitudinal
sampling via DBS, a broad panel of acute phase proteins and precise, multiplexed wide-dynamicrange quantitation using SISCAPA-MS. This picture captures details of inflammation processes
on multiple time scales, reveals complex relationships among inflammation-related proteins and
extends the measurable dynamic range downward to cover biology-driven fluctuations in APR
baselines (“microinflammation”). The results move beyond what can be observed through
sporadic measurements of a single marker such as CRP and offer the potential for major
improvements in diagnostic medicine and for monitoring subject responses in clinical trials.
While previous studies have examined many of these proteins alone, or occasionally in
small groups, this study is unique in applying a broad set of APR markers across many indications
at high frequency. Key to this broader coverage is selection of a group of APR proteins that vary
widely in response kinetics, magnitudes and function. Each inflammation-associated protein
biomarker shows a different characteristic time course of expression during an inflammation event.
APR proteins, which are generally produced in the liver, exhibit a protein-specific early phase
increase, likely governed by mRNA transcription and expression triggered by a short-lived
cytokine signal. Among the APR proteins, LPSBP typically rises most rapidly, followed in order
by SAA, CRP, A1AG, FibG, Hx, MBL, Hp, and C3. MPO, which in the context of whole blood
serves as a surrogate for the neutrophil count, typically shows a spike just before or coincident
with LPSBP, reflecting the fact that pre-existing neutrophils can be released from the bone marrow
immediately upon cytokine signaling, without a time-lag required for new protein synthesis. APR
proteins decline following an order (SAA, CRP, LPSBP, Hp, Hx, FibG, MBL, A1AG, C3) that is
generally consistent with previously measured half-lives of CRP, LPSBP, A1AG and C3 of 26,
32, 104 and 84 hours respectively [47]. Proteins peaking earlier and later provide complementary
information, analogous to the relationship between glucose and HbA1c measurements in diabetes:
fast responders provide a measure of inflammatory stimuli in the previous 1-3 days, while the
slower responders reflect stimuli that have occurred over much longer periods comprising a slower
initial rise and a slower decay. Thus at any given timepoint, the combined set of proteins provides
a readout reflecting inflammatory stimuli occurring over the previous 2-4 weeks

In addition to different expression times, the APR proteins also differ widely in the
amplitude of changes during inflammation events. Proteins exhibiting fast responses typically
show very large changes (10- to 1,000-fold from personal baseline values) while those showing
smaller, though still statistically significant changes (in some cases 1.1- to 1.5-fold changes from
personal baselines), typically show slow responses. Changes in Alb and IgM generally involve
decreases from baseline during major infections (i.e., they are negative APRs, changing with
polarity opposite to APRs like CRP).
The data also demonstrate directly, for the first time, that the quantitative relationships
between strongly responding APR proteins such as CRP, SAA and LPSBP are non-linear; i.e.,
producing different relative change magnitudes in large vs small scale inflammation events. The
APR panel used here thus achieves its overall design goal: to include proteins responding
differently in time, magnitude, polarity and functional responses to inflammatory signals.
Distilling these complex data in a way that provides maximum value in clinical diagnostics
or pharmaceutical trials presents several challenges. In the past, efforts to move beyond single
point CRP measurements have explored two scenarios: a multi-protein ratio at one time point, or
alternatively a single protein measured at multiple time points. Both approaches have significant
limitations.
In the first scenario, several ratios involving CRP have been explored for clinical diagnostic
applications, including, for example, the ratio of SAA to CRP, proposed as an indicator of
infectious disease severity in children [48]. In our results this ratio does appear to distinguish
between large and small infection responses when measured at the peak of response (Fig 5C);
however, the ratio changes so rapidly during an infection (up to 20-fold change over the course of
a few days as shown in Fig 2B) that sampling at any point off-peak can generate an incorrect
prediction. Likewise the ratio of fibrinogen to CRP has generated equivocal results [49–51] since
it also varies in time due to the difference in expression time courses for the two proteins.
Somewhat more success has been achieved using the ratio of CRP to albumin as a long-term
outcome predictor in pancreatic cancer [52], surgery in the elderly [53], sepsis [54], and stent
restenosis [55], while a similar 3-level index combining CRP and Alb measurements (the Glasgow
Prognostic Score [56]; GPS) has achieved more widespread use as an outcome predictor in many
cancers. The greater success of the CRP/Alb ratio and GPS may be attributed to the fact that the
components move in opposite directions during the APR (being positive and negative APR

respectively), so that inflammation-driven change of either protein from baseline drives the ratio
upwards. Nevertheless, the fact that individual APR proteins follow different time courses,
making any ratio between proteins time-varying, substantially limits the utility of protein:protein
ratios at any single timepoint.
The second scenario, using an index of CRP changes over time, has been more generally
successful for evaluating infection severity [57], risk of death in intensive care [58], presence of
post-surgical infection [59] and likelihood of success or failure of treatment in communityacquired pneumonia [60], sepsis [61], Crohn’s disease [62] and stem cell transplantation [63].
These methods make use of changes occurring between sample timepoints and thus provide more
information than single point CRP measurements. Nevertheless, because of the fast-response
nature of CRP, they do not incorporate information on inflammation levels outside narrow timewindows bracketing sample collection, nor, without effective prior measurement of personal
baseline levels, can they provide a personalized indication of inflammation severity.
A more powerful approach explored here incorporates measurements of multiple proteins
at multiple time points. As a first step, we have used two APR proteins responding on different
timescales (fast-responding SAA and slower-responding Hp) which allows inflammation events
to be visualized in two dimensions as shown in Fig. 6A. In this representation, inflammatory events
unfold as counterclockwise loops [46], beginning at baseline values for both proteins (coordinates
near 1:1 in the lower left), moving first to the right (rise of fast APR), then up (rise of slow APR),
then left (decline of fast APR) and finally down towards baseline (decline of slow APR). Loop
size and distance from the subject’s baseline samples indicate the magnitude of the response: the
2-week long upper respiratory infection (“Cough”) extends further than the surgical loop, which
in turn is larger than the loop corresponding to a cold. Deviations from a smooth loop trajectory
are attributable in the surgical case to post-surgical strains noted by the subject and correlated to
increased pain medication (Fig 2C and 2D). Any two adjacent (i.e., consecutive) samples on such
a loop generate a directional line segment whose position and slope indicate a) the size of the loop
(whose area approximates the intensity and duration of the whole response) and b) where the
subject is on the loop trajectory at that time (i.e., position on the path from insult, through recovery
and back to baseline). Given the relatively smooth structure of these loops, it appears that
comparison of two samples taken 6 hr (0.25 d) apart would provide a useful estimate of a subject’s

position and direction on the response loop, given the assay precision and baseline data obtained
here.
Our long-term objective, however, is to create a true multi-dimensional, personalized
longitudinal inflammation model including additional APR components and related features such
as neutrophil bursts (measured here as released MPO) preceding APR and adaptive immune
responses (measured here as IgM) following some infections. Such a model will incorporate the
temporal and magnitude relationships among the biomarkers (including the non-linear regulatory
effects first reported here), fitting multi-protein data from observed events to generate important
derived parameters. These include the integrated time and intensity of inflammation (the loop
areas in Fig. 6A being analogous to area under the curve for drug effects), as well as inferred time
of the start of inflammation (when sampling only begins after an event has started) and deviation
from a classic response trajectory (as a means for distinguishing inflammation events with different
causes). Some of the required methods may be adapted from classical pharmacodynamic (PD)
modeling, in which biomarkers are used to measure response to a known cause (e.g., a
pharmacokinetic (PK) drug dosing model). Simple PD models using CRP as a single biomarker
have been developed and used successfully in clinical trials of antibiotics [26–28], various
biologics [20,21,23,24]; antisense to CRP [25], and a MAPK inhibitor [33]. However PD-like
models of inflammation have not been adopted in clinical diagnostics despite a small handful of
successful examples [64], due in part to the rarity of applicable longitudinal samples and in part to
the inverse nature of the problem: whereas in PK/PD modeling the goal is to model the effects of
a known cause, in diagnostics one seeks to infer the cause from the effects on biomarkers.
Personalized PD inflammation models, developed using baselines and responses to inflammation
events (e.g., vaccinations, colds) in a subject’s longitudinal samples, would provide increased
precision in tracking inflammatory phenomena and optimal design of sampling protocols.
Additional methods for uncovering disease:biomarker relationships, including machine learning
approaches developed in “big data” applications, are also likely to benefit from personalized
longitudinal multiplex data described here.
A number of novel observations emerged from examination of our extended longitudinal
sample series. First is the unexpectedly large number of identifiable inflammation events, most of
which were apparently due to infections in apparently normal subjects. A surprisingly high
proportion (12-45%) of each subject’s samples showed indications of inflammation, whether
17

defined as CRP levels >2-fold above personal baselines, or inclusion in the 57 discernable APR
events. Similar proportions are obtained when considering only those samples collected on a neardaily basis (about 1/3 of the samples), in which the timing of collection should be less susceptible
to subjects’ selection bias. Such high event frequencies, if confirmed in a larger subject population,
suggest that unrecognized short-term “sub-clinical” inflammatory events are likely to occur
frequently during investigational studies and drug trials, and perhaps at even higher frequency in
unwell individuals (of which the Crohn’s disease subject is an example). Such changes may impact
behavior of drugs not directly related to inflammation, e.g., due to the well-known binding of many
small molecules to the APR proteins albumin and A1AG [65].
The frequency of small inflammation events also suggests that randomly-timed single CRP
measurements (such as those included in annual checkups) may overestimate a patient’s true
baseline level if collected during an inflammatory episode (i.e., 12-45% of the time according to
our estimate of samples indicating inflammation), and thus bias predictions of cardiovascular
disease risk [3,66]. Conversely a single CRP measurement is likely to underestimate the
likelihood that a patient has inflammatory episodes when used as a qualification for antiinflammatory therapy [67]. A clear improvement will be to use personal median baseline APR
levels (including CRP) derived from a series of longitudinal samples thus providing a significantly
better risk estimate by capturing baseline inflammation separately from fluctuations related to
transitory subclinical events.
Characterizing personal baseline inflammation proved to be more challenging (and
interesting) than anticipated. In the half of each individual’s samples with the lowest CRP
(presumably the samples showing the lowest levels of inflammation) we observed persistent
correlations between CRP, SAA and LPSBP, indicating that a significant amount of the observed

(“microinflammation”), rather than analytical “noise”. As a result, the spectrum of inflammatory
responses measurable using APR biomarkers appears to extend smoothly from +/- 10% (i.e., 0.91.1-fold) to 1,000-fold, a total dynamic range of over 10,000. This observation suggests the
possibility of correlating detectable subclinical inflammatory triggers with a variety of contextual
data including diet, environmental exposures, recurring infections and chronic inflammatory
disease.

The 57 discrete inflammation events we cataloged included events driven by a variety of
causes, both “planned” (surgery, vaccination, and intense exercise) and “unplanned” (infections,
and episodic inflammation related to Crohn’s disease). Given the small number of subjects
covered, these observations represent individual case reports and require follow-up in welldesigned studies of larger cohorts to confirm the generality of our observations.
Total hip replacement surgery in subject S-04 represented a “planned” inflammatory
intervention, whose known start time and 2 hr duration allowed precise timing of samples with
respect to the inflammatory stimulus (Figure 2C, D, E and Fig. 6A). In this case SAA rose rapidly
to maximum in less than 48 hours and fell to near baseline by day seven, while Hp and other slow
APR proteins reached a maximum on day four and did not return to baseline for four-eight weeks.
During the post-surgical recovery period, three clearly discernable peaks (~9, 18 and 22 days after
surgery) interrupted the recovery trajectory, the latter two of which correlate in time with physical
“strains” noted by the patient, causing increased requirement for pain medication (Fig. 2D).
Between 50-60 days post-surgery, the levels of APR proteins reached a new baseline significantly
below pre-surgery levels, a decrease in inflammation that provides a quantitative measure of the
benefit of replacing an arthritic hip joint. The level of temporal detail observable by this approach
provides a much more complete picture of recovery, including interruptions, than shown in
previous studies using a single marker (typically CRP) to detect post-surgical infection [59] or to
assess surgical damage [68].
A series of infection events generated the largest APR protein changes observed here,
seven of which resulted in SAA levels ³100-fold above personal baselines (Fig. 2A). These events,
and a series of smaller events usually attributed to common “nose colds”, provides evidence of a
non-linear relationship between maximal CRP and SAA inductions, as well as the lack of
synchrony mentioned above which limits use of the SAA/CRP ratio. Influenza vaccination
resulted in detectable APR responses that were ~100-fold lower than those observed with the major
infections. In addition to acute phase proteins, we also observed increases in IgM and MPO in a
subset of infections. While most infections did not cause measurable increases in IgM, three
episodes resulted in increases of 30-50% in total IgM 8-10 days after SAA peaked (Supplementary
Fig. 4), after which the levels subsided to pre-existing baseline levels. The production of such
large amounts of IgM after specific infection events is consistent with the expected timeframe for
an adaptive immune response to a pathogen, and may provide an opportunity to identify

endogenous human monoclonal antibodies from DBS samples with potential therapeutic value as
anti-infectives. In contrast, MPO, which serves in whole blood as a surrogate for neutrophil count,
was frequently increased at the earliest stage of infection followed by spikes every two or three
days (Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with periodic release from and regeneration of neutrophil
pools in the bone marrow [69].
In a single case of Crohn’s disease we observed a higher frequency of APR events than in
the other subjects, including 8 subject-identified “Crohn’s attacks”, 3 “colds” and one instance of
food poisoning. Interestingly, 3 of the Crohn’s attacks occurred at times of minimal APR levels,
while the others coincided with APR spikes of 2- to 10-fold above baseline levels. The brief
timecourse of the attacks highlights the necessity for frequent sampling as a basis for selecting an
optimal sampling strategy for any given condition: a weekly sampling schedule would have
completely missed most of the events (Fig 3B and C). A significant number of similar intensity
APR increases were not annotated and may represent subclinical events in unknown cause. Of
practical importance, over a 2-5 yr period, average CRP, SAA and Hp levels decreased alongside
steady improvement in the subject’s control of the disease. Since the relationship of Crohn’s
disease activity to inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP may be useful in a “treat-to-target”
approach to biologic therapy [70], it will be important to further elucidate these relationships in
multiple subjects.
Intense exercise with accompanying heat stress and strong sun, in this case occurring
during Olympic training for beach volleyball, was included here to assess the potential magnitude
of very short-term physical effects on APR responses. The most significant changes observed
were large decreases in Hp (presumably due to rapid removal of Hp:Hb complexes formed as a
result of exercise hemolysis [71]) and increases in MPO (presumably due to release of pre-formed
bone marrow neutrophils) during daily training sessions, neither of which depend on expression
of new protein. One substantial induction of CRP was noted in athlete 4B, occurring ~18 hr after
the largest spike in MPO, possibly indicating minor muscle damage.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that DBS collected under field conditions and
stored for periods up to nine years can be analyzed by SISCAPA-MRM to deliver high-precision
biomarker measurements spanning a very wide dynamic range. The automated workflow used
here [39], together with a personalized normalization strategy to remove DBS volume variation,

reduced assay CVs to ~5% in standard samples, a level substantially below previously estimated
within-person variation [72].
We note several limitations of the present study. While the sample numbers analyzed here
exceed those in all but a handful of biomarker studies, the number of subjects is modest, with only
5 individuals contributing more than 100 longitudinal samples each. Future studies will require
larger numbers of subjects in order to generalize conclusions about the frequency, scale and time
courses of inflammation events, to link this data with specific causes and outcomes, and to
determine optimal sampling frequencies for specific applications. While not strictly necessary in
studies such as ours that refer biomarkers to personal baselines, we also look forward to reporting
calibration of the individual biomarkers against validated clinical assays, and rigorous comparison
of dried capillary blood with liquid venous serum (manuscripts in preparation).
Future Perspective
In the future, a number of important opportunities can be addressed using inflammation
and other protein panels measured in subject-collected DBS and interpreted against carefully
defined personal baselines. Aside from obvious diagnostic needs in infectious and chronic
inflammatory diseases, APR responses are frequently noted in cancer biomarker discovery studies
and are likely to prove useful in monitoring cancer patients during treatment and in detection of
recurrence. Clinical trials of anti-inflammatory biologics can likewise benefit from detailed
tracking of APR responses covering a wider range of timescales than can be obtained with CRP
alone. In addition, patients can potentially benefit from more precise monitoring of inflammation
in relation to lifestyle changes, medical challenges and associated treatments.

Executive Summary
Background
• Inflammation is a key clinical feature of many disease states and its reduction is the goal
of a rapidly expanding range of biologics and small molecules
• C-reactive protein is currently used as a single diagnostic indicator of inflammation in
patients and is the primary biomarker of efficacy in anti-inflammatory drug trials
• Here we explore a higher-resolution picture of inflammation, using multiple protein
biomarkers and high-frequency sample collection to provide deeper insights into structure
of inflammatory events as well as asymptomatic normal baseline.
Experimental
• A unique set of 1,658 dried blood samples (DBS) was collected from 16 individuals over
periods up to 9 years, including daily collection for extended periods
• A panel of nine positive and three negative APR proteins was measured by SISCAPA-LCMRM mass spectrometry
• Spot-to-spot volume variation in dried blood spots (DBS) was reduced substantially by
normalization of a three-protein panel, providing total workflow assay CVs on replicate
DBS samples of 2.5-6%
Results
• A total of 57 discrete inflammation events were observed related to major infections,
vaccination, surgery, extreme exercise and Crohn’s disease
• APR proteins were differentially regulated during these events, with unique nonsynchronous time courses and non-linear regulatory relationships that require PD-like
modeling and interpretation more advanced than currently-used ratios
• CRP, SAA and LPSBP remained correlated in the subset of samples with lowest CRP,
indicating that very low level “microinflammation” phenomena can be measured and
extending the dynamic range of measurable APR to >10,000.
Discussion
• Multiplexed measurement of a broad panel of acute phase response (APR) proteins,
including CRP, at frequent timepoints using DBS microsamples provides improved
insights into the magnitude and dynamics of inflammation processes
• The approach provides personal baselines for each protein, allowing improved diagnostic
performance
• Clinical trials of anti-inflammatory biologics, antibiotics, and cancer therapeutics can
benefit from improved multi-marker pharmacodynamic models of inflammation.

Materials and Methods
Samples
A unique set of 1,522 long-term longitudinal capillary blood DBS samples (sample set I)
was self-collected at home between 2008 and 2017 by 8 participants using lancet finger-pricks
(Medlance Plus Extra or Special, HTL Strefa; Medline, Cat. No. HTD7045BX) and dried on
Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Table 1). The DBS cards were stored at 4° C in the
presence of desiccant except for brief periods at room temperature or at -20° C and were barcoded
prior to analysis. Transportation of specimens to the laboratory for processing followed the
guidelines provided by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for shipment of
DBS specimens. In addition, a set of 140 EDTA-treated venous whole blood samples (sample set
II) was collected from eight Brazilian professional athletes during four consecutive days of
Olympic-level beach volleyball training in a study organized by Prof. L.C. Cameron and A.
Bassini-Cameron (Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Samples were

Table 2. Proteotypic peptides and their proteins measured by SISCAPA-MRM
SISCAPA-LC-MRM protein measurement
A panel of proteins of known clinical significance was measured using SISCAPA-MRM
mass spectrometry. These included a broad set of APR proteins and other inflammation-related
proteins reported here (Table 2) and other biomarkers to be reported elsewhere. Sample
preparation and SISCAPA peptide enrichment were performed using an automated protocol
essentially as described [37–39,42] for all three datasets, with different, but largely overlapping,
sets of measured protein targets. Target protein amounts were expressed as femtomole (fmol) of
proteotypic peptide in each sample, calculated by multiplying the observed peak-area ratio (PAR;
the ratio of the endogenous target peptide MRM peak area to that of the stable isotope standard
(SIS)) by the known amount of added SIS. SIS peptides were labeled with 13C, 15N lysine or
arginine as the c-terminal amino acid.
Data analysis
PAR data were assembled in Tableau Prep Builder (www.tableau.com) and joined with
Excel tables defining sample characteristics (e.g., date of collection, subject contextual health
notes, SIS concentrations, analytical run structures, etc). Data analysis and visualization were
performed in Tableau Desktop (Tableau Software, Inc.).

To minimize the effect of variations in plasma volume between DBS from the same
individual (typically +/- 10-15%), we refined and applied a method developed previously [39] to
normalize plasma volume using a sample-specific scale factor computed from an equally-weighted
combination of three proteins (albumin, hemopexin and IgM) whose abundances are usually very
stable within individuals over time.
Replicate standard DBS samples were included in each 96 well plate processed for
SISCAPA measurement, normalized using the above methods and used to evaluate the precision
of each assay in each dataset. The average coefficient of variation (CV) across the assays used in
Datasets A, B and C were 6.7%, 5.9% and 4.5% respectively, consistent with expectations for
clinically useful assays.
After this subject-specific normalization, subject-specific baselines were computed for
each protein as the median level in the half of samples with lowest CRP (i.e., the samples showing
least evidence of current inflammation). Fold-changes were computed relative to these baselines
and so focus on relative responses in the individual rather than absolute scale of change.
