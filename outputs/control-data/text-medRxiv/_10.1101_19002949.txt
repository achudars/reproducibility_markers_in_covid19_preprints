Abstract

104

polymorphism is involved in a wide range of clinical outcomes. This makes ACE I/D an

105

important genetic marker. Updating the genetic profile of ACE I/D and raising the evidence

106

for its role in renal disease is therefore needed. Reported associations of ACE I/D with

107

progressive renal failure (PRF) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)

108

have been inconsistent, prompting a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates.

109

Methods Multi-database search yielded 18 articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Risks

110

(odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals) were estimated by comparing the ACE

111

genotypes (heterozygote ID, homozygotes DD and II). Heterogeneous (random-effects)

112

pooled associations were subjected to outlier treatment which yielded fixed-effects outcomes

113

and split the findings into pre- (PRO) and post- (PSO) outlier status. Subgroup analysis was

114

based on ethnicity (Asian/Caucasian) and minor allele frequency (maf). The ≥ 0.50 maf

115

subgroup indicates higher frequency of the variant II genotype over that of the common DD

116

genotype, otherwise, the subgroup is considered < 0.50 maf. Stability of the associative

117

effects was assessed with sensitivity treatment. Temporal trend of association was examined

118

with cumulative meta-analysis.

119

Results In the PSO analysis, overall effects were null (ORs 0.99-1.02) but not in the

120

subgroups (Asian and ≥ 0.50 maf), where in presence of the D allele (DD/ID) and the I allele

121

(II), increased (ORs 1.63-5.62) and reduced (OR 0.22) risks were observed, respectively.

122

Of these pooled effects, the Asian and ≥ 0.50 maf homozygous DD genotypes had high ORs

123

(5.01-5.63) indicating elevated magnitude of effects that were highly significant (Pa < 10-5)

124

and homogeneous (I2 = 0%), in addition to their robustness. In contrast, the Caucasian and

125

< 0.50 maf subgroup effects were: (i) non-heterogeneous (fixed-effects) at the outset, which

126

did not require outlier treatment and (ii) non-significant (ORs 0.91-1.10, Pa = 0.15-0.79).

127

Cumulative meta-analysis revealed increased precision of effects over time.

128

Conclusions PRF in ADPKD impacted the Asian and ≥ 0.50 maf subgroups where DD

129

homozygote carriers were up to 6-fold susceptible. The high magnitude of these effects

130

were highly significant, homogeneous and robust indicating strong evidence of association.

Introduction

139

characterized by fluid filled cysts in the kidneys leading to end stage renal failure in later

140

years of life [1]. Preventing progressive renal failure (PRF) is mainly treated with controlling

141

blood pressure and reducing proteinuria [2]. However, these reno-protective measures do not

142

benefit all patients [3]. These differential treatment outcomes may in part be attributed to

143

genetics. Studies on mouse and human models suggest that genetic variation plays a

144

significant role in PRF associated with ADPKD [4,5]. One genetic variation is the insertion/

145

deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, a 24 kb

146

sequence of DNA in intron 16 of chromosome 17q23. This gene encodes the ACE protein,

147

which is found in mammalian tissues and body fluids as ectoenzymes on cell surfaces and in

148

serum [6]. The I/D polymorphism has been shown to determine the levels of circulating ACE

149

enzymes [7]. ACE enzyme levels have been suggested to associate with the ACE genotypes

150

(heterozygote ID, homozygotes DD and II) possibly affecting therapeutic response [8].

151

Individuals carrying the DD homozygote genotype were found to exhibit the highest serum

152

ACE activity when compared to carriers of II homozygote and ID heterozygote genotype

153

who showed low and intermediate activity, respectively [7]. The relationship between ACE

154

activity and ACE genotypes, specifically homozygous DD appears to be the central concept

155

in the clinical genetics of renal disease [9]. In a modification of ACE activity, a meta-analysis

156

of 46 studies revealed that the genotypes (ID, DD) containing the D allele showed higher

157

plasma ACE activity than the homozygous II genotype [10]. In ADPKD patients, the DD

158

homozygote genotype was found to correlate with progression of renal insufficiency [11]. In

159

addition, ADPKD patients have hypertension, a severe complication in which the ACE gene

160

is most likely involved [10]. The value of ACE I/D as a genetic marker lies in its association

161

with risk of a wide range of clinical outcomes that include response to ACE inhibitor therapy

[12], cardiovascular diseases [10], diabetes-related [13,14], cancer [15], longevity [16],

163

Alzheimer’s disease [17] and muscle performance [18]. The span of ACE involvement in a

164

wide variety of clinical conditions and evidence of elevated ACE activity associated with the

165

ACE D allele prompted a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) from the quantitative

166

trait loci perspective [19], with no mention of ADPKD. Another GWAS profiled ADPKD

167

from an epigenetic perspective [20], with no mention of ACE I/D. Thus, GWAS has involved

168

ACE I/D and ADPKD which were not reported in the same study. One study that examined

169

both ACE I/D and ADPKD was a meta-analysis, which was published in 2006 [21]. Since

170

then, new primary studies have emerged, with inconsistent results. Given the variability of

171

results and length of time (13 years) since the last synthesis, we undertook this meta-analysis

172

for three reasons: (i) obtain less ambiguous, clearer estimates and updated role of ACE I/D

173

with renal failure progression in ADPKD; (ii) apply novel meta-analysis techniques (e.g.

174

outlier treatment) in order to raise the strength of evidence and (iii) examine the cumulative

175

trend of association. Simultaneous application of meta-analysis treatments that focus on the

176

pathophysiological role of ACE I/D precluded inclusion of other polymorphisms in this study.

177

This meta-analysis aims for better understanding of the genetics of PRF in ADPKD, so that it

178

may provide important information that might be useful to decision makers in healthcare,

179

particularly in the field of nephrology.

(i) case–control study design evaluating the association between ACE I/D and PRF in

193

ADPKD and (ii) sufficient genotype or allele frequency data to allow calculation of odds

194

ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Exclusion criteria are: (i) studies without

195

controls or studies whose genotype or allele frequencies were unusable/absent; (ii) those that

Data extraction

200

Two investigators independently extracted the data that resulted in consensus. Extracted

201

information from each article included the first author’s name, publication year, country of

202

origin, ethnicity, study design and whether the articles addressed the Hardy-Weinberg

203

Equilibrium (HWE). Articles which were not included in a previous meta-analysis [21] are

204

indicated by an asterisk under the author column (Table 1). Primary study authors were

205

contacted in order to obtain more information on incomplete data. Less than a third of the

206

included studies mentioned influence of the environment, but data were not provided.

207

Data distribution, power calculations and HWE assessment

208

Data distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilks (SW) test using SPSS 20.0 (IBM

209

Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Normal distribution (P > 0.05) warranted descriptive and

210

inferential expressions of mean ± standard deviation (SD) and the parametric approach,

211

respectively. Otherwise, the median (with interquartile range) and non-parametric tests were

212

used, respectively. Using the G*Power program [22], we evaluated statistical power as its

adequacy bolsters the level of associative evidence. Assuming an OR of 1.5 at a genotypic

214

risk level of α = 0.05 (two-sided), power was considered adequate at ≥ 80%. HWE was

studies [23]. The CB criteria include P-values, statistical power, correction for multiplicity,

220

comparative sample sizes between cases and controls, genotyping methods and the HWE. In

221

this scale, low, moderate and high have scores of < 5, 5-6 and ≥ 7, respectively.

222

Genetic models

223

From the 18 included studies [24-41], minor allele frequency (maf) of the homozygous II

224

genotype among controls was < 0.50 in 11 of them [25,30-33,35-37,39-41] and not (≥ 0.50)

225

the remaining seven [24,26-29,34,38]. Non-uniformity of the maf across the studies (S1

226

Table) influenced our study design in two ways: (1) maf data were dichotomized into

227

≥ 0.50 maf (DD < II) and < 0.50 maf (DD > II) and (2) precluded the use of standard genetic

228

modeling. Thus, we opted for the allele-genotype model, wherein we compared (i) DD

229

homozygotes with the ID/II genotype; (ii) II homozygotes with ID/DD genotype and

230

(iii) heterozygous ID genotype carriers with homozygotes of the II and DD genotypes.

Data synthesis

comparing the effects on the same baseline, we calculated pooled ORs. We performed a

237

cumulative meta-analysis to examine changes in the pooled ORs with accumulation of data

238

over time. Subgrouping was ethnicity-based (Asians and Caucasians) and maf-based (≥ 0.50

239

maf and < 0.50 maf). To assess the strength of evidence, we used three indicators: First, the

240

magnitude of effects are higher or lower when the pooled ORs are farther from or closer to

241

the OR value of 1.0 (null effect), respectively [42]. Second, the P-value is contextualized

242

from the Bayesian perspective of the Bayes Factor (BF). The BF compares support from the

243

null and alternate hypotheses, in contrast to the P-value, which addresses the null only [43].

244

Thus, P-values (Z-scores) of 0.05 and 0.001 (corresponding to minimum BFs of ≥ 0.15 and

245

0.005) indicate moderate and strong (to very strong) evidence, respectively [44]. The BF rests

246

on the likelihood paradigm [45], indicative of how strong the hypotheses are supported by the

247

data [43]. Thus, the likelihoods between the absence (null hypothesis) and presence (alternate

248

hypothesis) of association of ACE I/D with PRF in ADPKD are compared. Third,

249

homogeneity is preferred to heterogeneity, but heterogeneity is unavoidable [46]. Thus,

250

occurrence of heterogeneity between studies was estimated with the χ2-based Q test [47],

251

with threshold of significance set at Pb < 0.10. Heterogeneity was also quantified with the I2

252

statistic which measures variability between studies [48]. I2 values of > 50% indicate more

253

variability than those ≤ 50% with 0% indicating zero heterogeneity (homogeneity). Evidence

254

of functional similarities in population features of the studies warranted using the fixed-

255

effects model [49], otherwise the random-effects model [50] was used. Sources of

256

heterogeneity were detected with the Galbraith plot [51] followed by re-analysis (outlier

257

treatment). Of note, outlier treatment dichotomized the comparisons into pre-outlier (PRO)

258

and post-outlier (PSO). Sensitivity analysis, which involves omitting one study at a time and

259

recalculating the pooled OR, was used to test for robustness of the summary effects. We

260

assessed publication bias for comparisons that met two conditions: (i) ≥ 10 studies only [52]

261

and (ii) significant outcomes. Except for heterogeneity estimation [47], two-sided P-values of

262

≤ 0.05 were considered significant. All associative outcomes were Bonferroni-corrected in

263

order to control for Type 1 error. Data for the meta-analysis were analyzed using Review

level, however, power in both ethnic subgroups was > 80% (Asian: 97.3%; Caucasian:

was marginally significant (Pa = 0.05) and nullified in the PSO analysis (OR 1.02, Pa = 0.78).

322

HWE analysis validated the overall outcomes (Table 2). In the subgroups (Table 3), seven

323

associative outcomes (Asian and ≥ 0.50 maf) were statistically significant, moderate in PRO

324

(Pa = 0.01-0.02) and high in PSO (Pa < 10-4 to 10-5). The PSO outcomes survived the

325

Bonferroni-correction, but the PRO did not. The highly significant PSO outcomes had the

326

following features: (i) all were homogeneous (I2 = 0%); (ii) magnitude of the homozygote

327

DD increased risk effects was more (ORs 5.01-5.62) than that in heterozygote ID (ORs 1.63-

328

1.68); and (iii) the pooled homozygote II effect indicated reduced risk (OR 0.22). In contrast,

329

Caucasian and < 0.50 maf outcomes were non-associative between ACE I/D and PRF in

330

ADPKD (ORs 0.91-1.10, 95% CI 0.79-1.31, Pa = 0.15-0.79), and initially non-heterogeneous

331

(fixed-effects) which precluded outlier treatment (Table 3).

is visualized in Figs 2-4. Fig 2 shows the PRO forest plot, moderately significant (OR 2.84,

362

95% CI 1.25-6.44, Pa = 0.01) and heterogeneous (Pb < 10-4, I2 = 83%). The Galbraith plot

363

identifies two studies [25,26] as the sources of heterogeneity (outliers), located below the -2

364

confidence limit (Fig 3). In Fig 4, the PSO outcome (outliers omitted) shows eliminated

365

heterogeneity (Pb = 0.96, I2 = 0%); intensified increased risk effect (OR 5.62, 95% CI 3.93-

366

384

(Table 4). Thus, the Asian DD effects were more stable than that in ≥ 0.50 maf.

387

evidence of publication bias (Kendall’s τ = 0.23, P = 0.19).

Summary of associations
Evidence of association between the ACE homozygous DD genotype and risk of PRF in

417

ADPKD is tenuous in the overall analysis but strong in the subgroups (Asian and ≥ 0.50) at

418

the PSO level. This strength rests on the three indicators: (i) high magnitude of effects (up to

419

5.6-fold), which were (ii) homogeneous (indicating combinability of the studies) and (iii)

420

highly significant (up to Pa < 10-5). Of note in the Asian subgroup, the II homozygous effect

421

indicating 78% reduced risk also met the high strength of evidence criteria (Table 3), but was

422

found to be non-robust, which contrasted with robustness of the homozygous DD effect. Our

423

use of subgroup analysis and outlier treatment have unraveled significant and homogeneous

424

associations in three contexts, (i) not achieved in a previous meta-analysis; (ii) neither present

425

in the overall analysis; (iii) nor in the component single-study outcomes. However, the

426

process of subgrouping and performing outlier treatment reduced the number of studies and

427

sample sizes of the comparisons. These may decreased statistical power and risked Type 1

428

error, especially in light of a few (three to five) PSO studies generating multiple significant

429

outcomes in the subgroup analyses. Fortunately, adequate statistical powers of the three to

430

five Asian studies (82.2-97.3%) and their P-values surviving the Bonferroni correction served

431

to minimize the possibility of false-positives and increase confidence in the outcomes. Non-

432

associative outcomes in previous primary studies may be attributed to their lack of power and

433

small sample sizes. Underpowered outcomes appear to be common in candidate gene studies

434

[55] and are prone to the risk of Type 1 error. Other highlights of our findings are differential

435

effects between the ethnic (Asian versus Caucasian) and maf (≥ 0.50 versus < 0.50)

436

subgroups. Significant outcomes in Asian but not in Caucasians may be attributed to

437

differences in maf between the two ethnicities [56].

438

Cumulative meta-analysis

439

Studies on associations between ACE I/D and PRF in ADPKD from the last 20 years

440

produced outcomes that reduced the magnitude and retained the heterogeneity of

441

associations. On the other hand, the sustained increased precision and cumulative

442

significance of effects as well as increase in the number of studies may help establish

443

evidence of association.

444

Comparison with other meta-analyses

445

Five previous meta-analyses relate to our study, four of them not as direct as the fifth. The

446

first [57] focused on angiotensin II types 1 and 2 receptor genes (AGTR1 and AGTR2) in

447

various renal diseases that did not include ADPKD. The second to the fourth meta-analyses

448

[13,14,58] focused on ACE I/D with the outcome of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). All

449

three demonstrated associations of ACE I/D with ESRD, two of which drew race-specific

450

conclusions, one for Caucasians [58] and the other for Asians [14]. The fifth [21] directly

451

relates to our study which was published 13 years ago (2006); the features of both are

452

outlined in Table 4. Pereira et al [21] included non-English articles and meeting abstracts,

453

which we did not in our study because we evaluated methodological quality of the included

454

studies. Methodology-wise, Pereira et al used the recessive model (homozygous DD versus

455

heterozygous ID + homozygous II genotypes) versus the genotype model (homozygous DD,

456

and II, heterozygous ID) in ours. Comparative outcomes are based on the homozygous DD

457

genotype (Table 5). Three differences mark the overall analyses (ours and the previous): (i)

458

the number of studies (18 versus eight); (ii) significance of outcome (Pa = 0.05 versus P =

459

0.21) and (iii) magnitude of outcome (1.4-fold versus 1.2-fold). In the racial subgroups,

460

Pereira et al showed no material differences between the Asian and Caucasian outcomes

461

(both indicated non-significant increased risks, randomly-derived). In contrast, our outcomes

462

differentiated between the Asians and Caucasians (up to 6-fold versus null). In the Asian

463

outcomes, ours and the previous differed in terms of: (i) significance (Pa = 0.01-10-4 versus P

464

= 0.23) and magnitude of effect (up to 5.6-fold versus 1.6-fold). In the Caucasian analyses,

465

ours versus previous differed in the number of studies (12 versus four) and outcomes (null

466

versus 1.2-fold).

Genetic correlates

481

homozygous DD genotype in PRF and/or variable responses to renoprotective therapy.

482

Based on the evidence that the homozygous DD genotype elicits high ACE activity [7], it

483

was hypothesized that the homozygous DD genotype were resistant to renoprotective therapy

484

[9]. However, it has also been hypothesized that ACE I/D is in linkage disequilibrium with an

485

unknown DNA section containing a silencer motif that could inhibit ACE mRNA translation

486

[59,60]. This suggests variability of ACE expression at the DNA/mRNA level. Studies have

487

reported increased ACE mRNA expression in homozygous DD genotype patients in renal

488

[61] and other tissues [62,63]. It is then possible to identify different polymorphisms in the

489

ACE gene to identify patients at risk for PRF or therapy resistance. Evidence for the

490

association between serum ACE levels and ADPKD has not been consistent [33,39]. The

491

numerous studies that examined associations at the gene level had conflicting outcomes. An

492

association between the D allele of ACE I/D among ADPKD patients has been detected in

493

various populations [24,30,37,40], but not in others [25,29,32,33,35,36,39].

Understanding the impact of ACE I/D on renal disease might clarify the role of the

494
495
496
497

ACE gene, ACE protein and RAAS

498

electrolyte balance [64,65]. The activity of RAAS system in turn, is regulated by the ACE

499

protein where it mediates the rate of production of angiotensinogen from renin [66]. RAAS is

500

activated in progressive kidney disease leading to hypertension [67]. The role of hypertension

501

in the progression of kidney deterioration in ADPKD places the ACE I/D polymorphism at

502

the core of this research. On a morphological level, the pathophysiology of ADPKD involves

503

RAAS where it directly stimulates the growth of renal cysts [68]. Angiotensin II, a RAAS

504

component was observed within cysts and tubules leading to the cyst expansion [69].

The renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is critical in regulating blood pressure and

Strengths and limitations

508

(i) Eighty-nine percent of the component studies were underpowered; (ii) of the 29

509

comparisons, 22 (76%) were heterogeneous; (iii) pathological conditions of the some cases

510

were diluted, where ADPKD comprised part of the patients’ condition and (iv) despite the

511

high significance (Pa < 10-5) and magnitude (5-fold) as well as homogeneity (I2 = 0%) of the

512

homozygous DD PSO pooled effects in the Asian and ≥ 0.50 maf comparisons, their wide

513

CIs (3.60-8.04), suggests imprecision which may have compromised the durability of effects.

514

Larger sample sizes may be needed to ameliorate this limitation [70]. Of note, precision in

515

this study had opposing effects, reduced (wide CIs) with subgroup treatment but increased

516

(narrow CIs) with cumulative meta-analysis. The methodology may explain this paradox in

517

terms of sample size and number of studies (n), which was reduced with subgroup analysis

518

but increased with cumulative meta-analysis.

519

Interpreting our findings should consider its limitations and strengths. Limitations include:

On the other hand, the strengths comprise of the following: (i) the combined sample

520

sizes of the overall and subgroups translated to high statistical power; (ii) ten (56%) of the

521

18 articles addressed HWE concerns. Confining the analysis to studies in HWE did not

522

materially alter the pooled ORs; in fact, HWE-analysis validated the overall pooled effects.

523

Given this outcome, the risk of genotyping errors appears to be a minor issue which

524

minimizes methodological weakness in our study; (iii) outlier treatment reduced and

525

eliminated heterogeneity and enabled significance; (iv) the significant PSO ORs in the Asian

526

and ≥ 0.50 maf subgroups survived the Bonferroni correction, thus minimizing the possibility

527

of a Type 1 error; (v) sensitivity treatment conferred robustness to the overall and Asian

528

homozygous DD findings and (vi) publication bias was not evident in the PRO overall

529

comparison.

Conclusions

534

Substantial amount of evidence presented here may render ACE I/D useful as prognostic

535

markers for PRF in ADPKD. In spite of the evidence for associations, the complexity of

536

ADPKD involves interactions between genetic and non-genetic factors allowing for the

537

possibility of environmental involvement. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions

538

have been reported to have roles in associations of other polymorphisms with ADPKD. All

539

but five [29,32,38,39,41] of the 18 articles acknowledged gene-environment interaction.

540

Addressing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions [71] may help address the

541

pathophysiological significance of ACE I/D and PRF in ADPKD. Four of the included

542

articles mentioned haplotype analysis [26,27,35,39] with one presenting haplotype data [26].

543

Focus on ACE haplotypes have been suggested for future association studies [72]. Additional

544

well-designed studies exploring other parameters would confirm or modify our results in this

545

study and add to the extant knowledge about the association of the ACE polymorphism and

546

PRF in ADPKD.

We have shown that associations of ACE I/D with PRF in ADPKD are genotype dependent.
