Abstract

23

This large, retrospective case-control study of electronic health records from 56 million unique adult patients

24

examined whether or not treatment with a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocking agent reduced risk for

25

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and other inflammatory diseases

26

which are mediated in part by TNF and for which a TNF blocker is an approved treatment. The analysis

27

compared the diagnosis of AD as an outcome measure in patients receiving at least one prescription for a TNF

28

blocking agent (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) or for methotrexate. RA increased the risk for AD

29

(Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.06, 95% Confidence Interval: (2.02-2.10), P-value <0.0001) as did psoriasis

30

(AOR = 1.37 (1.31-1.42), P <0.0001), ankylosing spondylitis (AOR = 1.57 (1.39-1.77), P <0.0001) ,

31

inflammatory bowel disease (AOR = 2.46 (2.33-2.59), P < 0.0001), ulcerative colitis (AOR = 1.82 (1.74-1.91), P

32

<0.0001), and Crohn’s disease (AOR = 2.33 (2.22-2.43), P <0.0001). The risk for AD in patients with RA was

33

reduced by treatment with etanercept (AOR = 0.34 (0.25-0.47), P <0.0001), adalimumab (AOR = 0.28 (0.19-

34

0.39), P < 0.0001), and infliximab (AOR = 0.52 (0.39-0.69), P <0.0001). Methotrexate also reduced risk for

35

Alzheimer’s disease (AOR = 0.64 (0.61-0.68), P <0.0001), while further risk reduction was achieved in patients

36

with a prescription history for both a TNF blocker and methotrexate. Etanercept and adalimumab also reduced

37

the risk for AD in patients with psoriasis: AOR = 0.47 (0.30-0.73 and 0.41 (0.20-0.76), respectively. There was

38

no effect of gender or race, while younger patients showed greater benefit from a TNF blocker than did older

39

patients. This study identifies a subset of patients in whom systemic inflammation contributes to risk for AD

40

through a pathological mechanism involving TNF and who therefore may benefit from treatment with a TNF

41

blocking agent.

Introduction

43

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Characteristic pathology in brain includes the

44

presence of plaques (deposits of amyloid-β peptide) and tangles (intraneuronal deposits of hyperphosphorylated

45

tau protein) [1, 2]. These occur in hippocampus and associational cortex, regions of the brain important for

46

cognitive function. Accumulation of amyloid plaque occurs over many years and generally precedes accumulation

47

of intraneuronal tangles and cognitive dysfunction [2]. Progression of disease is associated with neuronal

48

degeneration, cortical thinning, and deepening and severe cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammatory changes

49

around the amyloid plaques include reactive astrocytosis and microglial cell activation [3]. Microglia cells, the

50

resident macrophages in the brain, derive embryonically from the same myeloid stem cells in bone marrow that

51

give rise to monocytes and macrophages elsewhere in the body [4]. Macrophages are one of the important drivers

52

of systemic inflammation through the overproduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other proinflammatory

53

cytokines [5]. In the brain, elevation of TNF in cerebrospinal fluid collected from subjects with mild cognitive

54

impairment is associated with progression to Alzheimer’s disease at 6 months follow up [6]. Multiple lines of

55

evidence indicate that TNF may trigger or amplify aberrant microglia signaling in the brain [7-10] and thereby

56

contribute to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis.

57

Multiple systemic inflammatory diseases are caused in part by the production of TNF by activated macrophages

58

and these can be treated effectively with a TNF blocking agent. Approved indications for TNF blockers include

59

rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s

60

disease (CD) which are subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [5]. Inflammation in RA is localized to

61

the synovial lining of the joints where synovial cell proliferation leads to a thickening of the lining, infiltration of

62

activated macrophages and other inflammatory cells, elevated production of TNF, and irreversible destruction of

63

the joint architecture and function [11]. TNF produced systemically may directly enter the brain through receptor-

64

mediated transcytosis [12]. In mice, both types of TNF receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, participate in the transport

65

of TNF across the blood brain barrier while other proteins present in blood are excluded. Thus, systemic

66

production of TNF may directly affect inflammatory processes in the brain relevant to Alzheimer’s disease.

67

We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that systemic inflammation involving TNF is associated with increased

68

risk for Alzheimer’s disease and that this could be mitigated by a TNF blocking agent. A previous case-control

69

study of 8.5 million insured adults in the United States (US) reported increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease in

70

patients with RA and that etanercept, a TNF blocking agent prescribed for the treatment of RA, was associated

71

with reduction of risk for AD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.30; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.08-0.87. P-

72

value = 0.02) [13]. The study was based on 9,253 patients with Alzheimer’s disease in the private insurance

73

database.

74

Alzheimer’s disease is underrepresented in US private insurance databases as most patients with Alzheimer’s

75

disease are older than 65, an age in the US when the majority of Americans transition from employer provided,

76

private insurance to Medicare, a national health insurance program. We therefore undertook a retrospective study

77

using the IBM Watson Healthcare Explorys Cohort Discovery platform which contains electronic health records

78

(EHR) from patients with private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. The Explorys Cohort Discovery platform

79

contains the de-identified EHR of nearly 56 million unique patients with age ≥ 18 years from 26 healthcare

80

systems across all 50 states in the US from 1999 to 2018. We expanded our analysis to other inflammatory

81

diseases and to additional drugs in the class of TNF blocking agents to assess their potential effect on risk for

82

Alzheimer’s disease. Recent studies have shown that with this unique EHR database and built-in informatics

83

tools, large hypothesis-driven case-control studies can be undertaken [14-16]. Sufficient patient EHR were

84

available for the evaluation of co-morbid AD in patients with RA or psoriasis that were treated with etanercept,

85

adalimumab, and infliximab. Etanercept (Enbrel®) is a fusion of soluble TNF receptor 2 with the Fc portion of

86

mouse immunoglobulin G1 [17]. Adalimumab (Humira®) is a fully human, anti-TNF monoclonal antibody [18],

87

while infliximab (Remicade®) is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody in which the antigen combining

88

region of a mouse anti-TNF monoclonal antibody was fused to a human Fc domain [19]. Such large, biologic

89

drugs are not expected to have good access to brain after subcutaneous or intravenous injection due to exclusion

90

of protein macromolecules by the blood brain barrier [12, 20].

Methods

93

Database description

94

We performed a retrospective case-control study using de-identified population-level EHR collected by the IBM

95

Watson Health Explorys Cohort Discovery platform from 360 hospitals and 317,000 providers [15]. The de-

96

identified data are accessed using the Explore application from the Explorys Cohort Discovery platform. Explorys

97

collects data from multiple health information system using a health data gateway (HGD) server. The data

98

collected include patient demographics, disease diagnoses, medication history, findings, procedures, and

99

laboratory test results. The EHR are de-identified in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and

100

Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health

101

(HITECH) Act standards. After the de-identification process, the HGD server normalizes the data to facilitate

102

search using the clinical ontologies from the United Medical Language System (UMLS) [21]. Specifically,

103

systematized nomenclature of medicine – clinical terms (SNOMED-CT) are used to map disease diagnoses,

104

clinical findings, procedures, and pharmacological drug classes [22]; individual drug names are mapped into

105

RxNorm [23], and lab results and measurements are mapped into logical observation identifiers names and codes

106

(LOINC) [24]. For HIPAA-compliant, statistical de-identification, the IBM Watson Health Explorys Cohort

107

Discovery platform does not report cohort counts less than 10. At the time of the study, the Explorys Cohort

108

Discovery platform contained over 64 million unique patients among which nearly 56 million were over 18 years

109

of age (21 % of the U.S. population).

110

Study population

111

Patients were drawn from the Explorys platform and categorized based on their disease diagnoses and medication

112

history. We defined patients as having Alzheimer’s disease if they had any encounter diagnosis in their

113

contributing EHR of Alzheimer’s disease based on the SNOMED-CT disease name. A similar method was

114

applied for identifying patients with the broader diagnosis of dementia. Since Alzheimer’s disease is a

115

subdiagnosis of dementia within SNOMED-CT, the group of patients with dementia included all patients with a

116

diagnosis of dementia (Table 1). SNOMED-CT disease names also were used to identify patients diagnosed with

117

one of eight inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,

118

inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is a SNOMED-

119

CT diagnostic category that includes all patients with the subdiagnosis of ulcerative colitis but excludes patients

120

with Crohn’s disease. Patients diagnosed with more than one inflammatory disease were excluded from the

121

analysis. For example, a patient diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis who also was diagnosed with ankylosing

122

spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis with arthropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s

123

disease was excluded from the analysis. The effects of each inflammatory disease on Alzheimer’s disease or

124

dementia were compared to a non-inflammatory disease group that comprised patients who had no diagnosis of

125

any of the eight inflammatory diseases.

126

A patient was considered “taking a medication” if at least one outpatient prescription for the medication had been

127

written for the patient. Patients who took a drug treatment were identified by searching the generic drug names.

128

The Explorys Cohort Discovery platform has standardized all drug names to their generic names based on

129

RxNorm. There are five TNF blocking agents that have been approved by US Food and Drug Administration

130

(FDA): etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab. Sufficient numbers of subjects

131

(at least 10 patients in each cell in a two by two table for at least one strata) were available to study the effects of

132

etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab. For the analysis, subjects were included if they were treated with a single

133

TNF blocker but were excluded if they were treated with two or more TNF blocking drugs. For example, in the

134

etanercept group, patients who also were prescribed adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, or golimumab

135

were excluded. Similarly, in the methotrexate group, patients who also were prescribed at least one of the TNF

136

blocking agents were excluded. The effects of the TNF blockers were assessed with and without a prescription

137

history for methotrexate. The effects of each drug treatment on the risk for Alzheimer’s disease or dementia

138

including Alzheimer’s disease were compared to a control group of patients who did not have prescriptions for

139

any TNF blocking agents or for methotrexate. Figure 1 is a screenshot that illustrates how the Explorys Cohort

140

Discovery platform was used to perform cohort identification for the case-control study using the Explore fast

141

search tool.

142

Statistical Analysis

143

The crude Odds Ratio (OR), 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and P-values were calculated using the Fisher exact

144

test in univariate analysis. The Adjusted OR (AOR), 95% CI and P-values were calculated using the Cochran-

145

Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method by controlling for confounding factors such as age, gender, and race [25].

146

Statistical tests were conducted with significance set at P-value < 0.05 (two-sided).

147

To compute the AORs of dementia for the drug use group versus the corresponding non-drug use group, or for the

148

inflammatory disease group versus the non-inflammatory disease group, we first calculated the OR for each of the

149

8 strata (tabulation of 2 age groups: 18-65, and >65 years; 2 genders: male and female; and 2 races: Caucasian and

150

Non-Caucasian) and then calculated the weighted average across all strata using the CMH method [25]. The AOR

151

comparing the drug use group versus the non-drug use group were calculated separately in patients with a

152

diagnosis code of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. There were not enough patients (at least one cell in a two by

153

two table have counts lower than 10 for all the strata) to test the effect of TNF blocking agents in patients with the

154

other inflammatory diseases. To assess the effects of gender, age, and race on the risk associations between the

155

therapeutic drugs and dementia, we separately calculated the crude OR of dementia among the 2 age groups, 2

156

gender groups, and 2 race groups. To adjust for methotrexate prescription status in psoriasis patients, we

157

separately calculated the crude OR for a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia among 16 strata (tabulation

158

of 2 age groups, 2 gender groups, 2 race groups, and 2 methotrexate groups (history of methotrexate or no

159

methotrexate) and then calculated the weighted average across all strata using the CMH method [25].

160

Similarly, the AOR of co-morbid Alzheimer’s disease for each inflammatory disease group versus the control no-

161

inflammatory disease group were calculated by weighted average across all 8 strata. The AOR comparing the

162

drug use group with non-drug use group on Alzheimer’s disease were only calculated among patients > 65 years

163

due to the limited sample size for patients <65 years that were diagnosed with both Alzheimer’s disease and a

164

TNF-related inflammatory disease. Specifically, the AORs of Alzheimer’s disease were the weighted average of

165

OR across all 4 strata (tabulation 2 genders: male and female; and 2 races: Caucasian and non-Caucasian) using

166

the CMH method [25].

167

We used patient insurance types (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance) as a proxy for their socioeconomic

168

status. We calculated the AOR of dementia by taking the insurance status into account. We performed this

169

procedure for patients with age between 18-65 and patients with age > 65 years old separately, since the majority

170

of patients with age > 65 use Medicare insurance. For patients 18 - 65 years old, the AOR were calculated by

171

controlling for gender (male and female), race (Caucasian and non-Caucasian), and insurance status (private

172

versus no-private insurance). For patients > 65 years old, the AOR were calculated by controlling for gender

173

(male and female), race (Caucasian and non-Caucasian), and insurance status (Medicare versus no-Medicare).

174

Results

175

Structure of the Study Population

176

The IBM Watson Health Explorys Cohort Discovery platform contained EHR from 55,902,250 unique adult

177

patients (≥ 18 years of age) at the time of the study. The baseline characteristics of the study population are

178

presented in Table 1. The proportion of female patients is slightly higher than the proportion of male patients

179

(54.88% versus 44.80%), while only a small proportion of patients (176,170: 0.32%) have a missing value for

180

gender. The proportion of Caucasian patients is higher than non-Caucasians (57.75% versus 42.25%). Patients

181

between 18-65 years (70.25%) are the majority age group while only a small proportion of patients (870,670:

182

1.56%) have a missing value for age. 35.51% (19,851,070) of adult patients have private insurance, while

183

12.61% (7,048,160) are enrolled in Medicare and 6.16% (3,448,710) receive Medicaid. Since the majority of

184

patients older than 65 years in the US transition from private insurance to Medicare, the Explorys Cohort

185

Discovery platform contains a study population that represents the general US population and the age-dependent

186

prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease due to the inclusion of Medicare patients. Patients with missing values for

187

gender or age were excluded when performing statistical analysis.

188

In the absence of confirmatory brain imaging for amyloid or tau, or pathology post-mortem, the diagnosis of

189

Alzheimer’s disease is a clinical diagnosis made by a physician based on an interview and cognitive assessment.

190

Even with carefully selected patients enrolled in large, multi-center, Phase 3 clinical trials, Alzheimer’s disease is

191

misdiagnosed based solely on clinical criteria in up to 25% of patients [26, 27]. In a database such as the

192

Explorys Cohort Discovery platform that aggregates EHR from large, integrated health delivery systems and

193

community-based networks, the rate of misdiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease may be even higher. Therefore, we

194

structured our analysis to proceed in two stages. We first calculated the AOR for a SNOMED-CT diagnosis of

195

Alzheimer’s disease and second, expanded the analysis using the SNOMED-CT diagnosis of dementia. Within

196

SNOMED-CT, dementia is a general diagnostic term that includes all patients with a specific diagnosis of

197

Alzheimer’s disease. Within our study population, 338,400 (0.60%) patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s

198

disease while 999,800 (1.79%) patients were diagnosed with dementia including Alzheimer’s disease. In

199

addition to Alzheimer’s disease, the SNOMED-CT diagnosis of dementia includes subdiagnoses of presenile

200

dementia, mild, mixed, moderate and severe dementia, dementia associated with human immunodeficiency virus

201

infection, and frontal temporal lobe dementia, but excludes dementia associated with Huntington’s disease,

202

Parkinson’s disease, Rett’s syndrome and vascular dementia. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in the 2018

203

US population is estimated at about 2% of persons older than 18 years, so the Explorys study population of

204

dementia including Alzheimer’s disease approximates the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in the US [28].

205

Based on prescription history, a substantial number of patients with suspected Alzheimer’s disease are likely

206

classified within the Explorys Cohort Discovery platform with a diagnosis of dementia. For example, the

207

approved uses of the cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) and memantine by the

208

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are for treating mild, moderate or severe dementia of the Alzheimer’s

209

type. Rivastigmine has an additional FDA approval for use in mild-to-moderate dementia associated with

210

Parkinson’s disease. Of 338,400 patients with a diagnosis code for Alzheimer’s disease, 172,750 (51%) received

211

at least one prescription for a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, while an additional 157,850 patients with a

212

diagnosis code for dementia were also treated with at least one drug approved for Alzheimer’s disease (24%). A

213

high proportion of these patients likely represent cases of dementia due to suspected Alzheimer’s disease.

214

Querying more broadly in the Explorys Cohort Discovery platform for any use of a cholinesterase inhibitor or

215

memantine, 145,860 patients were prescribed at least one of the four drugs without a SNOMED-CT diagnosis of

216

dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. This included 9,540 patients with a diagnosis code for Parkinsonism,

217

3,900 with a diagnosis code for degenerative disease of the central nervous system, and 3,990 patients with a

218

diagnosis code for traumatic brain injury. Thus, Explorys captures both approved and off-label use of

219

prescription drugs.

220

Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease is Increased by Systemic Inflammation

221

We hypothesized that systemic inflammatory diseases which in part are mediated by TNF increase the risk for

222

Alzheimer’s disease. We therefore selected for study those inflammatory diseases for which a TNF blocking

223

agent is an FDA approved treatment [5]. Approved indications include rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing

224

spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease.

225

Five TNF blocking agents have been approved by FDA, of these, sufficient patients were prescribed etanercept

226

(44,210 patients), adalimumab (66,820 patients), and infliximab (40,290) to allow inclusion in the retrospective,

227

case-control study. In addition, 161,560 patients received at least one prescription for methotrexate but had not

228

been treated with a TNF blocking agent. Methotrexate is a small molecule inhibitor of immune cell activation

229

that suppresses systemic TNF [29]. In normal clinical practice, patients are started on methotrexate and those

230

who fail methotrexate may progress to a treatment with a TNF blocking agent. Of those who progress to the TNF

231

blocking agent, 60% will continue on methotrexate and 40% will drop the methotrexate [29, 30].

232

The cumulative age distribution for patients with a diagnosis code for rheumatoid arthritis, dementia or

233

Alzheimer’s disease is shown in Figure 2. Given that the Explorys Cohort Discovery platform includes at least

234

some information on patients making up over 20% of the US population, the cumulative age distribution should

235

reasonably represent the age-dependent prevalence of these diseases in the US. As expected, the age distribution

236

of patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis skews younger, while patients with dementia or Alzheimer’s

237

disease skew older. The average treatment retention time varies among the three TNF blocking agents selected

238

for study with etanercept having a better than 50% patient retention rate at 12 years of treatment, while the 50%

239

retention rates for adalimumab and infliximab are about 2 and 3 years, respectively [30, 31]. To comply with

240

HIPAA compliant de-identification of EHR, the Explorys Cohort Discovery platform does not allow patient level

241

access to prescription data. Therefore, we compared the benefit of etanercept to adalimumab and infliximab as a

242

surrogate for duration of exposure as a modifier of treatment benefit.

243

Systemic inflammatory disease is a substantial risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (Figure 3). Greatest risk is

244

associated with inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s disease followed by rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative

245

colitis (as a subcategory of inflammatory bowel disease), ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. There is no

246

additional risk associated with psoriatic arthritis. Inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid

247

arthritis increase the risk for Alzheimer’s disease over two-fold (AOR 2.06 (2.02-2.10) – AOR 2.46 (2.33-2.59)).

248

The increased risk contributed by systemic inflammation was replicated in patients with a diagnosis code for

249

dementia in which Alzheimer’s disease is a subcategory (Figure 4). Risk for dementia was elevated two-fold in

250

patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and

251

Crohn’s disease (AOR 2.00 (1.94-2.06) -AOR 2.69 (2.66-2.72)). Psoriasis also increased risk for Alzheimer’s

252

disease and dementia although to a lesser extent (AOR 1.37 (1.31-1.42) and AOR 1.49 (1.46 – 1.53),

253

respectively). Thus, systemic inflammation increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease across multiple diseases

254

involving the joints, the gut and the skin.

255

TNF Blocking Agents Reduce Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease in Patients with Systemic Inflammation

256

If the increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease is associated with TNF, then TNF blocking agents should reduce risk

257

for Alzheimer’s disease in patients with co-morbid inflammatory disease. Since TNF blocking agents frequently

258

are prescribed as an add-on to methotrexate, we compared subjects who received a TNF blocking agent without

259

methotrexate with those who received the TNF blocking agent and methotrexate. Treatment of rheumatoid

260

arthritis with etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab significantly reduced the risk for Alzheimer’s disease with

261

etanercept and adalimumab having the greatest benefit (AOR 0.34 (0.25 – 0.47) and AOR 0.28 (0.19 – 0.39),

262

respectively), Figure 5. The benefit of etanercept and adalimumab was replicated in patients with a diagnosis

263

code of dementia (AOR 0.30 (0.26 – 0.35) and AOR 0.35 (0.30 – 0.41), respectively). Etanercept and

264

adalimumab have similar benefit even though the treatment retention time with etanercept (50% at 12 years) is

265

considerably longer than adalimumab (50% at 2 years) [30, 31]. Infliximab had slightly greater benefit than

266

methotrexate, but methotrexate alone significantly reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia (AOR 0.52

267

(0.39 – 0.69) and AOR 0.64 (0.61 – 0.68), respectively), Figure 5. We therefore asked if the benefit of the TNF

268

blocking agents replicated in patients with a prescription history of a TNF blocker and methotrexate compared to

269

methotrexate alone. Etanercept and adalimumab had similar benefit in reducing risk for co-morbid Alzheimer’s

270

disease in patients who also had a prescription history for methotrexate (AOR 0.53 (0.42 – 0.67) and AOR 0.61

271

(0.49 – 0.77), respectively) while the benefit of infliximab was less (AOR 0.77 (0.63 – 0.67), Figure 6.

272

Reduction of risk for Alzheimer’s disease also was seen in psoriasis patients treated with a TNF blocking agent

273

(Figure 7). Etanercept (AOR 0.47 (0.30 – 0.73) and adalimumab (AOR 0.41 (0.20 – 0.76) significantly reduced

274

risk for Alzheimer’s disease in patients with psoriasis and the benefit of adalimumab (AOR 0.54 (0.44 – 0.66) was

275

replicated when expanded to patients with a diagnosis code for dementia (Figure 7). Infliximab and methotrexate

276

had no benefit. A substantial number of psoriasis patients had a prescription history of a TNF blocker with

277

methotrexate. Methotrexate alone did not reduce risk for Alzheimer’s disease, nor did use of a TNF blocker

278

provide additional benefit adjusting for methotrexate prescription status beyond the benefit of etanercept or

279

adalimumab alone (AOR 0.53 (0.37 – 0.76) and AOR 0.50 (0.32 – 0.78), Figure 8. The Explorys Cohort

280

Discovery platform does not permit access to patient level data, so a limitation of this analysis is that we do not

281

know if the TNF blocker was prescribed as an add-on to methotrexate or if the two drugs were prescribed

282

sequentially with methotrexate dropped once treatment with the TNF blocker was started.

283

We separately assessed the effects of gender, age, and race on the effect of TNF blocking agents on the risk of

284

dementia among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Data are shown for etanercept in Figure 9. Female and male

285

patients had a similar benefit when treated with etanercept (P = 0.14), adalimumab (P = 0.14), or infliximab (P =

286

0.71). There was a significant difference in benefit when comparing Caucasian versus non-Caucasian patients

287

with a prescription history for etanercept (P = 0.022) but not for adalimumab (P = 0.34) or infliximab (P =

288

0.078). Interestingly, the risk reduction was greatly increased for younger patients (18-65 years) as compared to

289

older patients (> 65 years) with AOR 0.16 (0.11 – 0.22) in younger patients as compared to AOR 0.40 (0.34 –

290

0.46) in older patients (Figure 9). Greater benefit also was seen in younger patients prescribed adalimumab (P =

291

0.022) or infliximab (P = 0.00026) as compared to older patients.

292

We also explored insurance status as a potential confound for age (comparing younger patients with private

293

insurance as compared to patients over 65 years with Medicare) and socioeconomic status (patients with Medicaid

294

or private insurance). There was no difference between patients with private insurance as compared to Medicare,

295

nor does adjusting insurance status influence the effect of TNF blockers on the risk for dementia (Figure 10).

296

There were too few patients with Medicaid and Alzheimer’s disease (21,030, 6.2%) or Medicaid and a diagnosis

297

of dementia (84,040, 8.4%) for analysis (Table 1).

298

Finally, we sought to understand if treatment with a TNF blocking agent simply reduced the additional risk for

299

Alzheimer’s disease contributed by a co-morbid inflammatory disease, or if the TNF blocking agent could reduce

300

risk for Alzheimer’s disease below the risk in the general population in the absence of inflammatory disease as a

301

risk factor and excluding a prescription history for a TNF blocker or methotrexate. Indeed, the risk for

302

Alzheimer’s disease was reduced below the general population risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with

303

adalimumab (AOR 0.62 (0.43 – 0.89) and in psoriasis patients treated with etanercept (AOR 0.58 (0.37 – 0.90) or

304

adalimumab (AOR 0.48 (0.23 – 0.88), Figure 11. The benefit of adalimumab also replicated for reduction of risk

305

in psoriasis patients with a diagnosis code for dementia (AOR 0.82 (0.67 – 1.00), Figure 11.

306

Discussion

307

This study shows that inflammatory diseases involving TNF are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s

308

disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or Crohn’s disease are at highest risk for

309

Alzheimer’s disease. For rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, treatment with a biologic drug that targets TNF

310

correspondingly reduces the risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

311

This case-control analysis provides an assessment of the additional risk for Alzheimer’s disease that can be

312

attributed to co-morbid inflammatory disease involving TNF. Although there are genetically-defined subgroups

313

at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease, for example, patients with highly penetrant, autosomal dominant APP, PS1

314

or PS2 mutations,[1] late-onset Alzheimer’s disease generally is viewed as a heterogenous disease with multiple

315

genetic, medical and environmental risk factors [2, 32]. Our analysis suggests that co-morbid inflammatory

316

disease defines a subgroup of Alzheimer’s patients in which systemic production of TNF contributes to

317

pathogenesis. Systemic TNF may promote neuroinflammation in the brain through receptor-mediated

318

transcytosis [12]. Biologic drugs such as etanercept and adalimumab distribute poorly to brain, so we presume

319

the TNF blockers act systemically to prevent TNF from reaching the brain and thereby prevent or delay the onset

320

of Alzheimer’s disease.

321

Our study indicates that systemic inflammatory conditions involving TNF are a potentially treatable risk factor for

322

Alzheimer’s disease. This is a small, but potentially treatable subgroup of people at risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

323

The total number of patients with Alzheimer’s disease in the US is estimated to be 5.3 million in 2018 [28].

324

Based on our estimate of population attributable risk, 0.21 million cases (4.04%) of Alzheimer’s disease might be

325

preventable by treating rheumatoid arthritis with a TNF blocking agent, 0.08 million cases (1.51%) of

326

Alzheimer’s disease might be preventable by treating Crohn’s disease with a TNF blocking agent, and 0.026

327

million cases (0.50%) of Alzheimer’s disease might be preventable by treating psoriasis with a TNF blocker or

328

nearly 6% of cases of Alzheimer’s disease.

329

Etanercept previously was evaluated in a small, placebo-controlled study enrolling 41 patients with mild-to-

330

moderate Alzheimer’s disease [33]. End points in the study assessed improvement in cognitive function and

331

activities of daily living. There was a trend for etanercept benefit at 24 weeks of treatment across multiple

332

assessments. These results are encouraging given the small size of the clinical trial and support further study of

333

the treatment benefit of etanercept in symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. Etanercept also was evaluated in a small,

334

open label clinical trial in Alzheimer’s disease with report of clinical benefit [34], while therapeutic benefit was

335

reported earlier for reducing risk of major depression in a pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial of etanercept for the

336

treatment of psoriasis [35]. A previous study also suggested that TNF blocking agents are associated with

337

decreased incidence of co-morbid Parkinson disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [36].

338

Supporting evidence for a role of TNF in Alzheimer’s disease comes from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership

339

– Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD), a large-scale, precompetitive public private partnership led by the National

340

Institute on Aging (NIA). Nominated targets with supporting evidence include multiple elements of the TNF

341

signaling pathway such as TLR4, NFKBIA, NFKBIZ, TNFSR1A [37]. TLR4 encodes the Toll like receptor 4, a

342

receptor in microglia, monocytes and macrophages that triggers TNF release when activated by

343

lipopolysaccharide, or in the case of microglia, by amyloid beta peptide [32]. TLR4 and a second Toll-like

344

receptor, TLR5, are upregulated in the Alzheimer’s brain and soluble fragments have been shown to act as decoy

345

receptors to ameliorate disease phenotypes in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease [38]. NFKBIA

346

and NFKBIZ are components of the nuclear I kappa B protein signaling pathway that regulates the expression of

347

TNF while TNFSR1A encodes the TNF receptor superfamily member 1A that is activated by TNF [39].

348

Microglia activation and gliosis formerly were considered secondary to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s

349

disease, however, recent genetic studies in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease implicate microglia- and astrocyte-

350

related pathways in disease pathogenesis.[10, 40, 41] One focus of interest is TREM2, an innate immune receptor

351

expressed on microglia and myeloid cells [42, 43] . Rare TREM2 mutations associated with Alzheimer’s disease

352

suggest that TREM2 deficiency contributes to Alzheimer’s disease risk [44, 45]. TREM2 is a negative regulator

353

of the release of TNF and other inflammatory cytokines through activation of the Toll-receptor pathway [8, 43,

354

46].

355

TNF signaling can be targeted by small molecule therapeutics [7, 9, 47]. For example, this pathway is modulated

356

in monocytes, macrophages and microglia by phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) [48, 49], while treatment with a

357

PDE4B allosteric inhibitor after acute brain injury reduces microglial activation, reduces production of TNF, and

358

provides neuroprotective benefit in rats [50]. Small molecule drugs targeting the TLR4-TNF pathway may

359

produce greater therapeutic benefit than large, biologic drugs for which brain penetration may be limited.

360

Epidemiologic studies previously suggested that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce the

361

risk for Alzheimer’s disease [51]. In a case-control study of 49,349 US Veterans, protective effects were seen with

362

ibuprofen, naproxen and other NSAIDs with > 5 years of use (OR 0.76 [0.68-0.85]). Use of an NSAID was most

363

frequently associated with osteoarthritis (46-48% of cases and controls). The risk reduction associated with use of

364

an NSAID was less than the risk reduction of Alzheimer’s disease due to use of methotrexate in patients with

365

rheumatoid arthritis (OR 0.51 [0.49-0.54]), Figure 3. Multiple randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have

366

failed to show benefit of treatment with an NSAID in prodromal or symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease [52-54].

367

NSAIDs are one of three categories of therapeutics used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.[5] The other categories are

368

corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). NSAIDs are used for the control of pain

369

and inflammation while corticosteroids and DMARDs are used to reduce the cellular immune response that leads

370

to destruction of the joint. NSAIDs suppress prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes

371

COX-1 and COX-2, and thereby reduce immune cell activation, but may increase TNF production [47, 55]. The

372

lack of efficacy seen with NSAIDs in Alzheimer’s disease may be associated with the lack of a strong suppressive

373

effect on TNF production. Low dose prednisone (10 mg/day) is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, presumably by

374

suppressing immune activation and TNF production, but long term use is associated with increasingly

375

unacceptable side effects. Treatment with low dose prednisone for 1 year failed to show benefit in patients with

376

mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease [56].

377

Strengths and Limitations

378

The strength of the current study is that the massive-scale of the EHR database allowed us to access real-world

379

patient populations. With 64 million unique patient EHR, the IBM Watson Health Explorys Cohort Discovery

380

platform has aggregated the medical records from approximately 20% of the US population. Such a massive

381

database covers the full spectrum of disease diagnoses and the use of prescription drugs for both approved and

382

off-label indications. Access to large data sets is particularly useful in the case of Alzheimer’s disease where a

383

substantial fraction of patients in a clinical setting are either misdiagnosed as having the disease when they do not

384

or for whom the physician is unwilling to make a specific diagnosis even though Alzheimer’s disease is suspected

385

and an approved medication for Alzheimer’s disease is prescribed. This allowed us to test for the association of

386

co-morbid Alzheimer’s disease with systemic inflammatory disease and to test the benefit of TNF blocking agents

387

by first selecting patient cohorts with a specific diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and then by replicating that

388

finding in a larger cohort of patients with dementia which better reflects the uncertainty of the diagnosis of

389

Alzheimer’s disease in a community health setting.

390

The scale of the Watson Health Explorys Cohort Discovery platform allowed us to maintain adequate statistical

391

power while we studied disease association and the benefit of TNF blockers across multiple inflammatory

392

diseases. This often is difficult in traditional observational studies which frequently are limited in sample size.

393

Compared to the private insurance database used in the previous study [13], the Explorys Cohort Discovery

394

platform contains a study population that includes patients with private insurance and Medicare. This is

395

particularly critical for the study of diseases that primarily affect an elderly population as the majority of patients

396

older than 65 years in the US transition from private insurance to Medicare.

397

The current study has limitations. First, the quality or incompleteness of the EHR for individual patients may

398

affect the sensitivity and specificity of the analysis and misdiagnosis will contribute to false positives and false

399

negatives within the patient cohorts selected for study Second, the retrospective case-control analysis suggests a

400

potential therapeutic benefit of TNF blocking agents in Alzheimer’s disease, however, the analysis does not

401

distinguish an effect on treatment of prevention, nor does our analysis address how the severity of disease may

402

influence benefit. A limitation of the Explorys Cohort Discovery platform is the inability to access patient level

403

data for reasons of confidentiality. We are unable to extract age at diagnosis, duration of treatment, or years of

404

follow up which are potential confounding factors to this analysis, nor are we able to build an exposure-response

405

relationship for the reduction in risk due to use of a TNF blocking agent. Due the fact that we used population-

406

level data, we relied on the odds ratio for the statistical analysis and cannot calculate an incidence rate ratio [36].

407

Additionally, the Explorys Cohort Discovery platform considers patients to be “taking a medication” if at least on

408

outpatient prescription has been written for the medication, but does not record if medications were prescribed

409

sequentially after the first drug failed, or whether two or more medications were prescribed concurrently. These

410

potential confounds may lead our findings to underrepresent the “true findings.” Without access to patient level

411

data, we were only able to control for known confounding factors using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)

412

method [25] instead of systematically identifying and controlling for potential confounding factors using a more

413

rigorous multivariable regression method. Even with these limitations, the results of our study are consistent with

414

a previous study using patient-level data [13] and with a unpublished study reported in the popular press. As

415

shown in Table 2, the therapeutic benefit of etanercept on risk for co-morbid Alzheimer’s disease that we report

416

in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is consistent with a previous case-control analysis of 8.5 million privately

417

insured patients [13] and with an unpublished study that reportedly analyzed claims data from 254,000 patients.

418

Thus, our study conducted with a massive EHR database is consistent with smaller studies conducted with

419

patient-level data collected using private insurance claims databases.

420

Conclusions

421

Our analysis demonstrates the value of a large, population-based database aggregating EHR from nearly 56

422

million adult patients for the rapid interrogation of the treatment benefit of prescription drugs. Patients diagnosed

423

with a systemic inflammatory disease are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, while TNF

424

blocking agents reduce the risk for co-morbid Alzheimer’s disease in real-world patients diagnosed with

425

rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis.
