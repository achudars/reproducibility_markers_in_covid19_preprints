Abstract
Background. Cognitive impairment associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) is well-supported by meta-analytic studies, but population-based estimates remain
scarce. Previous UK Biobank studies have only shown limited evidence of cognitive
differences related to probable MDD. Using updated cognitive and clinical assessments in UK
Biobank, this study investigated population-level differences in cognitive functioning
associated with lifetime MDD.
Methods. Associations between lifetime MDD and cognition (performance on six tasks and
general cognitive functioning (g-factor)) were investigated in UK Biobank (N-range 7,45714,836, age 45-81 years, 52% female), adjusting for demographics, education and lifestyle.
Lifetime MDD classifications were based on the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview. Within the lifetime MDD group, we additionally investigated relationships
between cognition and (i) recurrence, (ii) current symptoms, (iii) severity of psychosocial
impairment (while symptomatic), and (iv) concurrent psychotropic medication use.
Results. Lifetime MDD was robustly associated with a lower g-factor (β = -0.10, PFDR =
4.7×10-5), with impairments in attention, processing speed and executive functioning (β ≥
0.06). Clinical characteristics revealed differential profiles of cognitive impairment among
case individuals; those who reported severe psychosocial impairment and use of psychotropic
medication performed worse on cognitive tests. Severe psychosocial impairment and
reasoning showed the strongest association (β = -0.18, PFDR = 7.5×10-5).
Conclusions. Findings describe small but robust associations between lifetime MDD and
lower cognitive performance within a population based sample. Overall effects were of
modest effect size, suggesting limited clinical relevance. However, deficits within specific
cognitive domains were more pronounced in relation to clinical characteristics, particularly
severe psychosocial impairment.

1. Introduction
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent condition, affecting around one
in five people in their lifetime globally (1–3). Previous clinical research has shown that
individuals with MDD show cognitive deficits, particularly in executive functioning, working
memory, attention, and processing speed (4–7), as well as affect-related cognitive biases,
including negative information biases for perception, attention, and memory (8,9).
Additionally, there is evidence that residual cognitive deficits are present in remitted cases
(4,10–12). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis that investigated studies including
individuals remitted from MDD revealed significant small to moderate deficits in the same
domains of cognitive functioning, and showed worse cognitive functioning associated with
recurrent episodes (12).
Meta-analyses are invaluable for investigating patterns of results from smaller studies
that are heterogenous in nature. One disadvantage however is that included studies show
differential procedures of participant inclusion and recruitment, of which some will be more
focused on certain clinical populations (e.g. allowing bipolarity or including participants after
antidepressant treatment). As a result, meta-analytically derived effect sizes may overestimate
cognitive impairment related to MDD compared to the general population. Understanding the
degree of impairment associated with lifetime MDD (current or past diagnosis) in the general
population thus requires further investigation within a sufficiently powered community-based
sample. This summarises the added value of population-based studies which are not biased by
specific clinical characteristics and that are sufficiently powered to detect potentially modest
effect sizes.
UK Biobank is a large-scale adult population-based study that is well-suited to
investigate population-level cognitive differences related to lifetime MDD. Previous
population-based studies that investigated baseline assessments of the UK Biobank cohort
study indicated modestly decreased visuospatial memory performance in participants with
lifetime MDD (13), but showed comparable cognitive performance to controls for other
cognitive measures of reasoning, reaction time and memory (13,14). Robust evidence from
population-based studies is currently limited, so that the degree and patterns of cognitive
impairment in community-based individuals with lifetime MDD remain uncertain.
Of note, UK Biobank follow-up assessments were recently extended to include
updated cognitive measures with improved reliability (15,16). These tests also cover a broader
range of cognitive domains previously implicated in MDD and show sufficient performance

variability within the healthy population. Furthermore, previous mood disorder groupings
relied on a combination of self-report and relatively unstructured questionnaire items, whereas
the more recent lifetime MDD assessments were based on a structured diagnostic interview
questionnaire, i.e. the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF) (17). In the
current study we used the opportunity provided by these updated assessments to further
investigate patterns of cognition functioning in lifetime MDD within the large populationbased UK Biobank sample.
Furthermore, the novelty and clinical relevance of this study was increased by
additionally conducting a population-based investigation of clinical characteristics associated
with cognitive functioning. The first clinical variable of interest was recurrence of depressive
episodes, given the usually highly recurrent nature of MDD and the ongoing discussions with
regard to ‘scar theories’ (which propose that disease-related psychological or biological
changes may result in a predisposition to future depressive episodes) (18). Although earlier
research did not consistently report recurrence of MDD being associated with lower cognitive
functioning (10,19), recent evidence suggests that cognitive deficits do accumulate with
repeated episodes (12). Furthermore, although no optimal measure of MDD remission was
available from UK Biobank assessments, we investigated associations with the putative
presence of current depressive symptoms. There is a general consensus that low mood can
negatively affect cognitive performance, and more pronounced cognitive impairment for
symptomatic individuals is supported by previous meta-analytic studies (6,10,20). However,
another meta-analysis showed similar effect sizes for the current and remitted state (4), and
associations with depressive symptoms may be attenuated within the general population (21).
Thirdly, we addressed associations between psychosocial functioning during the depressive
episode and subsequent cognitive deficits. Previous research suggests that cognitive deficits
contribute to impaired psychosocial functioning (22–24), which impacts on quality of life.
Furthermore, cognitive deficits were found to mediate of decreased work performance,
contributing to the overall cost attributable to MDD (25,26). The fourth clinical variable of
interest was use of psychotropic medication concurrent with cognitive assessment.
Pharmacological treatment is expected to have a complex influence on cognitive functioning,
although reliable evidence is limited (27). Meta-analyses suggest that some antidepressants
may improve cognition (28,29), but these results appear to be specific to particular treatments
(30–32), while for other treatments, medication side-effects may potentially affect cognitive
performance negatively (6,14,33). Given the variety of psychotropic medications, we did not
aim to investigate their differential effects, but rather investigated the overall association

between psychotropic medication and cognitive functioning within the general population.
In summary, the aim of the current study was to investigate cognitive functioning in
the context of lifetime MDD within the general population, as conducted within the largescaled population-based UK Biobank sample. Robustness of associations was tested via
inclusion of different combinations of demographic, education and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol
consumption and Body Mass Index [BMI] (34,35)) covariates. We also examined clinical
characteristics that are considered relevant to cognitive functioning in the context of lifetime
MDD and may therefore influence the association: (i) recurrence of depressive episodes, (ii)
current MDD symptomatology, (iii) severe psychosocial impairment (while symptomatic),
and (iv) use of psychotropic medication (at time of assessment). These characteristics were
hypothesised to distinguish case subgroups with more severe cognitive impairment, or
specifically for psychotropic medication, either increased or reduced impairment.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Adults (40 to 69 years) were recruited for participation in UK Biobank
(http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) between 2006 and 2010 (36). The present study included
participants with data for at least one of the neuropsychological test scores from the third UK
Biobank assessment (2014 onwards; N = 28,480). Participants with self-reported neurological
conditions were excluded from all analyses. A g-factor, representing general cognitive
function, was derived from all remaining participants with complete data for included
cognitive test measures (N = 13,589). When assessing individual tasks, complete cognitive
data was not required. Participants with specific psychiatric disorders or an
unclassified/missing lifetime MDD status were excluded from further analyses
(Supplementary Materials 1, Figure S1). Following exclusion criteria, N = 14,877 individuals
(ncases = 4,486, Mage = 63.5, SDage = 7.4, age range 45-81 years, 52% female) were included
across all analyses, with sample sizes ranging from N = 7,457 to N = 14,386 per case-control
analysis.
2.2. Measures and procedure
At the third assessment, participants visited the assessment centre where they provided
demographic and health information in response to a series of touchscreen questions and
completed computerised cognitive tests on a touchscreen. Medical history and current
medication use were assessed during interviews led by health professionals. Furthermore,

participants completed a web-based mental health questionnaire (MHQ) at home (37). Most
participants (all those with complete cognitive data) completed the MHQ between 2.2 years
before and 0.4 years after their assessment centre visit. UK Biobank received research ethics
committee (REC) approval for the centre assessments (ref 11/NW/0382), later amended to
also cover the MHQ, and all participants provided informed consent before assessment
(http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=200).
2.2.1. Classification of lifetime Major Depressive Disorder
Case-control classification was based on the short form of the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF) (17), administered as part of the MHQ (37). This included
two binary questions regarding (i) ever having experienced depressive feelings or (ii) loss of
interest, for a period of two or more weeks. Participants who responded ‘Yes’ to either
question then answered a question about the lifetime number of depressive episodes, followed
by six binary questions on experience of other DSM-IV MDD symptoms during their worst
episode, including: (iii) feelings of worthlessness, (iv) tiredness, (v) difficulty concentrating,
(vi) suicidal thoughts, (vii) changes in sleeping pattern, and (viii) changes in weight. Summed
responses to all eight depression symptom questions provided a symptom score (range 0-8).
Participants were also asked how often they had experienced depressive feelings / loss of
interest during their worst episode, how long these feelings lasted, and whether they interfered
with their “roles, life or activities” (psychosocial impairment). Participants were classified as
lifetime MDD cases if all of the following applied (37):
i)

Summed symptom score >= five

ii)

At worst, symptoms experienced “almost every day” or “every day”, and lasted
“most of the day” or “all day”

iii)

Symptoms impaired psychosocial functioning “somewhat” or “a lot”

2.2.2. Clinical characteristics
Within individuals who were classified with lifetime MDD as described above, we
further identified four clinical characteristics: (i) recurrent MDD, reflecting more than one
depressive episode, (ii) putative current MDD symptoms, as derived from responses on the
touchscreen questionnaire (Supplementary Materials 2), (iii) severe psychosocial impairment
(at the time of the depressive episode), indicated by the maximum CIDI-SF symptom score of
eight in combination with the maximum score for psychosocial impairment (37); and (iv)
concurrent use of psychotropic medication, which was derived from reported use of

antidepressant (94.6%), antipsychotic (3.9%) or anxiolytic (1.5%) medication as assessed
during the nurse-led interview (Supplementary Materials 3, Figure S2).
2.2.3. Cognitive assessment
In the current study we considered cognitive tests from the third UK Biobank
assessment. We included data from the following cognitive tests:
i)

Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST)

ii)

Trail Making Test, alphanumeric trail (TMT-B)

iii)

Numeric Memory (NM)

iv)

Matrix pattern completion (Matrix)

v)

Verbal Numeric Reasoning (VNR)

vi)

Tower rearranging (Tower)

This selection comprises all updated cognitive test data available at time of analysis
(DSST, TMT-B, Matrix, Tower), and additionally included two cognitive tests repeated at this
assessment that were also administered at earlier UK Biobank assessments (VNR, NM).
Further details on each cognitive test can be found in Table 1. Psychometric properties,
advantages and limitations of the UK Biobank cognitive tests have been discussed in detail
elsewhere (16).
2.2.4. Education and lifestyle data
Measures of education, alcohol consumption and smoking were derived from
touchscreen questionnaire responses (Supplementary Materials 4). For education, a multiplechoice question allowed participants to report all qualifications. Participants were classified
into one of five categories depending on the highest qualification they had attained. Alcohol
consumption was measured as alcohol units per week (38). Past smokers were categorised by
pack years (39) quartiles, with participants who had never regularly smoked in a fifth
category. BMI (in kg/m2) was derived by the UK Biobank team from physical measurements.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.2.3). Continuous variables were
visually inspected and log-transformed where necessary to more closely approximate normal
distribution. We reversed the TMT-B variable before statistical modelling, so that for all tests,
higher scores represented better performance. For all outcome variables, negative regression
coefficients thus indicated negative associations with cognitive performance. Regression

coefficients are standardised throughout. Significance level was determined by a two-tail
threshold of α = .05.
2.3.1. Derivation of g-factor
We derived a g-factor as single measure of general cognitive functioning (40) by
application of Principal Component Analysis (R function ‘prcomp’) including only complete
observations (n = 13,589), extracting scores on the first principal component. This derived gfactor accounted for 45.0% of the test score variance. Component loadings of the model were
all in the expected direction (loadings range 0.34 to 0.47; Supplementary Materials 5, Table
S1 and Figure S3).
2.3.2 Statistical Modelling
Associations between lifetime MDD and cognitive performance were tested using
linear models. Each model included lifetime MDD as the predictor of interest and a cognitive
score as the outcome variable. Primary models included age and sex as confounds (Tables 2
and 3). Additional models also included (i) education, (ii) lifestyle factors (alcohol, smoking
and BMI), and (iii) both education and lifestyle factors (full model) as potential confounds.
All results were false discovery rate (FDR) corrected across the 24 test-specific models and
separately across the four g-factor models. Explorative analysis assessed age by MDD
interactions on cognitive functioning.
With the aim of investigating whether cognitive performance related to specific
clinical features of depression, we also examined relationships, within the case group only,
with recurrent depression, putative current depressive symptoms, impact on psychosocial
functioning, and psychotropic medication use. Firstly, we tested a linear model including
participants classified with lifetime MDD only (n = 2,179; Figure 2A) that predicted g-factor
from all four clinical characteristics, including age and sex as covariates. Given the large
degree of overlap between clinical characteristics within our sample, these variables were
entered as simultaneous predictors in order to model their unique contributions to cognitive
functioning. Secondly, we further explored whether the four clinical characteristics were
associated with differential profiles of cognitive performance. Using the same approach, we
tested another six univariate linear models (applying FDR-correction) that predicted each
cognitive test scores from all four clinical characteristics, including age and sex as covariates.

3. Results
3.1. Sample Characteristics
Table 2 summarises demographic and lifestyle information on participants who
completed all cognitive tests. The MDD group included a higher proportion of females
(45.6% of controls, 67.2% of cases, χ2(1) = 293.2, P < 2.2×10-16). MDD cases were also
younger (M difference = 2.2 years, t(4357.9) = 12.1, P < 2.2×10-16), had higher BMI (Mdn
difference = 0.7 kg/m2, H(1) = 40.1, P = 2.4×10-10), were more often lifetime regular smokers
(20.7% of controls, 27.9% of cases, χ2(1) = 46.0, P = 1.2×10-11), and among smokers, they had
smoked more cigarettes (Mdn difference = 1.8 pack years, H(1) = 7.8, P = 5.3×10-3).
Conversely, control group participants reported more alcohol consumption (Mdn difference =
1.7 units/week, H(1) = 46.6, P = 8.7×10-12). Education did not significantly differ between
groups (χ2(4) = 5.6, P =.23). Case and control sample sizes for individual cognitive tests, as
well as test descriptive statistics, can be found in Table S2 (Supplementary Materials 6).
3.2. Associations between lifetime MDD and cognitive performance
Results indicated significant associations between lifetime MDD and cognitive
performance (Table 3). The primary models consistently showed lower cognitive performance
for the case group relative to controls with small effect sizes in terms of the g-factor (β = 0.10, PFDR = 4.7×10-5) and four of the six cognitive tests (DSST, β = -0.13, PFDR = 1.1×10-7;
TMT-B, β = -0.08, PFDR = 1.1×10-3; VNR, β = -0.06, PFDR = 2.0×10-3; Tower, β = -0.06, PFDR
= 3.4×10-2) (Figure 1). These results were robust over subsequent models that additionally
included confounding variables, and almost all significant results (except for the Tower
lifestyle model) survived multiple comparison correction. Associations between cognitive
performance and covariates are reported in Supplementary Materials 7. Explorative analyses
did not suggest any age by MDD interactions on cognitive functioning (Supplementary
Materials 8, Table S4).
3.3 Associations between clinical characteristics and cognitive performance
For the associations between clinical characteristics and cognitive impairment, as
measured by g-factor, we found no effect of recurrent depression (β = 0.02, P = .56), and a
very modest, non-significant point estimate for putative current symptoms at time of
assessment (β = -0.07, P = .15). Conversely, severe psychosocial impairment during the
depressive episode was significantly associated with lower g-factor (β = -0.14, P = 1.5×10-2).
Use of psychotropic medication showed a small, non-significant point estimate for its

association with general cognitive functioning (β = -0.10, P = .10).
Further exploration within the lifetime MDD case group revealed differential cognitive
profiles related to clinical characteristics (Figure 2B-E and Supplementary Materials 9, Table
S5). Severe psychosocial impairment was associated with worse VNR performance (β = 0.18, P = 1.2×10-5, PFDR = 7.5×10-5). Furthermore, results indicated nominally significant
associations with lower TMT-B performance for severe psychosocial impairment (β = -0.11,
P = 2.3×10-2, PFDR = 0.07) and psychotropic medication (β = -0.13, P = 2.7×10-2, PFDR =
0.16).
4. Discussion
The findings of the current study describe a robust association between lifetime MDD
and lower general cognitive performance within a population-based sample. The DSST,
TMT-B, VNR and Tower results further indicate that executive functioning, processing speed
and aspects of reasoning were predominantly affected. These effects were of modest overall
effect size (β = -0.10 for general cognitive performance), suggesting that they are of limited
clinical relevance, although such differences may have substantial consequences for whole
populations. Comparisons within the case group however showed that severe impact on
psychosocial functioning (while symptomatic) and use of psychotropic medication (at time of
assessment) predicted the lowest measures of cognitive performance. These clinical
characteristics also showed differential profiles of cognitive impairment, whereby severe
psychosocial impairment was associated with reasoning (VNR) deficits. Severe psychosocial
impairment, along with use of psychotropic medication, were also related to moderately lower
mental flexibility and processing speed (TMT-B). These results highlight that cognitive
functioning is impaired among individuals with current but also past MDD, and that deficits
within specific cognitive domains may be more pronounced – and therefore of potential
clinical relevance – in relation to impact of the depressive episode on psychosocial
functioning (after recovery) and continued use of psychotropic medication.
Meta-analyses of small case-control studies have previously indicated cognitive
deficits associated with current and remitted MDD within the domains of processing speed,
executive functioning, memory and attention (4,12). This study corroborates such previous
findings, but we also note that these population-level effect sizes are smaller than in
traditional case-control studies. Of note, psychosocial impairment while symptomatic was
also significantly associated with greater cognitive deficits in individuals with lifetime MDD,
and we found some evidence for an association between psychotropic medication use and

lower processing speed. This implicates that clinical studies that recruit from treatment
centres, and thereby include participants from a patient group more likely to experience
severe psychosocial impairment and/or use psychotropic medication, may show inflated effect
sizes in comparison with the general population because of their sample characteristics.
Psychosocial impairment during the depressive episode was found to be associated to
lower cognitive functioning subsequent assessment. Because other clinical characteristics
such as the putative presence of current depressive symptoms were taken into account, this
suggests that the impact of a depressive episode on quality of life may not be limited to the
symptomatic phase. This result is consistent with previous adult clinical studies (23) and may
reflect a subgroup of remitted individuals vulnerable to cognitive impairment, who potentially
also experienced greater cognitive deficits during the depressive episode. Previous clinical
research also showed that cognitive impairment in remitted MDD was associated with
psychosocial dysfunction in multiple domains (24). Future research will need to address the
underlying causality of the relationship between severe psychosocial impairment and
impaired cognitive functioning in the context of lifetime MDD. If functional impairment
persists specifically in remitted individuals who experience residual cognitive deficits, quality
of life could be increased with interventions that target cognitive symptoms (24,41–43).
Findings of the current study did not indicate robust associations of cognitive
impairment with recurrent depressive episodes current MDD symptoms, as well as less robust
associations with psychotropic medication. Thus, within the healthy and non-clinical UK
Biobank population, these MDD characteristics were less relevant to the association between
lifetime MDD and cognitive impairment.
Of note, however, the current investigation was limited by the phenotypes available in
UK Biobank, and one disadvantage was that no certain measure of remission or continuous
measure of depressive symptoms at time of cognitive assessment could be established.
Furthermore, although the current study benefited from the availability of newer, more
reliable cognitive assessments in UK Biobank, this did impose the limitation of a crosssectional design. We also note that the classification of lifetime MDD was based on the CIDISF, which, although based on diagnostic criteria and well validated, is still limited by reliance
on retrospective self-report. Given the aim of the current study to investigate (residual)
cognitive impairment associated with lifetime MDD in the general adult population, the midlate life age range of UK Biobank participants at the time of the third assessment could also
be considered a limitation. However, the cohort has been previously described as a relatively
healthy mid-late life cohort (37), from which we excluded individuals with reported

neurological or degenerative conditions from the current study, and exploration of age
interaction effects did not suggest that results were driven by accelerated age-related cognitive
decline. Future large-scale longitudinal research will be needed to unravel the relationship
between MDD and cognitive impairment over the disease course as well as the lifespan.
In summary, the present findings suggest that lifetime MDD relates to impaired
cognitive functioning among adults in their mid-late life, with most prominent deficits in the
cognitive domain of processing speed (DSST). Severe psychosocial impairment during the
depressive episode was associated with greater overall cognitive impairment, and specifically
on tasks of reasoning (VNR) and mental flexibility and processing speed (TMT-B).
Furthermore, clinical characteristics showed differential profiles of impairment of modest
effect. These findings add to meta-analytic evidence by providing accurate population-level
estimates, which is an important foundation for future studies addressing cognitive
functioning in the context of MDD. Longitudinal trajectories of cognitive performance in
lifetime MDD and the differential influences of pharmacological treatments on these
trajectories are important targets for further research. The longitudinal association between
psychosocial impairment while symptomatic and subsequent cognitive impairment, also when
remitted, reflects their likely impact on quality of life and suggests that both cognitive and
psychosocial functioning should be key targets in the treatment of MDD.
