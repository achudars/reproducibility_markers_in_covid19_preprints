Abstract
Background—Mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
are not well understood. We hypothesized that HCM is characterized by the specific
electrophysiological substrate as compared to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), or
healthy individuals.
Methods—We conducted a prospective case-control study. HCM patients at high risk for
ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) (n=10; age 61±9 y; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
60±9%) and three control groups (Healthy individuals (n=10; age 28±6 y; LVEF>70%), ICM
patients with LV hypertrophy (LVH) and known VT (n=10; age 64±9 y; LVEF 31±15%), and
ICM patients with LVH, and no known VT (n=10; age 70±7y; LVEF 46±16%). All participants
underwent 12-lead ECG, cardiac CT or MRI, and 128-electrode body surface mapping (BioSemi
ActiveTwo, Netherlands). Non-invasive voltage and activation maps were reconstructed using
the open-source SCIRun (University of Utah) inverse problem-solving environment.
Results—In endocardial basal anterior segment, HCM patients had the slowest ventricular
conduction [54.3±8.6 vs. 64.0±8.0 (ICM with VT) vs. 63.3±5.4 (ICM no VT) vs. 66.1±5.4 cm/s
(Healthy); P=0.019], the largest unipolar voltage [1086±241 vs. 982±230 (ICM with VT) vs.
853±281 (ICM no VT) vs. 802±108 µV (Healthy); P=0.016], and the greatest voltage dispersion
[median(interquartile range) 178(162-276) vs. 146(89-157) (ICM with VT) vs. 161(102-214)
(ICM no VT) vs. 101(53-147) µV (Healthy); P=0.017]. Differences were also observed in other
endo-and epicardial basal and apical segments.
Conclusion—Ventricular conduction velocity is slower in HCM when compared with ICM,
even in myocardial segments remote from the region of maximal wall thickness, suggesting a
distinct electrophysiological substrate in HCM.

Introduction
Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are at high risk of life-threatening
ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD).1 Mechanisms of arrhythmogenicity in
HCM are complex and incompletely understood. It was previously shown that the late sodium
current is increased in HCM, suggesting the importance of repolarization abnormalities.2 At the
same time, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies have shown that the myocardium in HCM
is characterized by increased fibrosis burden, supporting an alternative mechanism for
arrhythmogenesis - heterogeneity in electrical activation. The degree of late gadolinium
enhancement in HCM is associated with SCD and appropriate implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) therapy.3 Previously, a similar frequency of both reentrant monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) was observed in HCM patients
with ICD,4 suggesting similarity of mechanisms with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). While
the presence of patchy scar in HCM suggests likely similarity in macro-reentrant VT
mechanisms with post-myocardial infarction (MI) VT, VT ablation in HCM is less successful
than in post-infarction VT. In HCM patients who underwent VT ablation, the incidence of VT
recurrence, death, and cardiac transplantation at one year was one of the highest amongst all nonischemic cardiomyopathies (NICM),5 even after adjusting for comorbidities. This may be due to
anatomic limitations for ablation (predominantly mid-myocardial septal location of the scar), or
diffuse nature of cardiomyocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis that features histopathological
hallmark of HCM6. By and large, electrophysiological (EP) substrate in HCM is incompletely
understood. Recently, the non-invasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGi), a state-of-the-art
technology, became available as a tool to study mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias.7 We

designed this study with the goal to describe the EP substrate of HCM, in comparison to
relatively well-understood EP substrate of post-infarction macro-reentrant VT.
Methods
Study population: inclusion and exclusion criteria
We conducted a single-center case-control study of high-risk HCM cases with three control
groups (Clinical Trial Registration—URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov Unique identifier:
NCT02806479). The study was approved by the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and all participants signed an informed consent form.
Enrollment was performed at OHSU in 2016-2018. Adult (age≥18y) non-pregnant participants
were enrolled if the inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, as described below.
Inclusion criteria for HCM group were: (1) history of resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest, or
documented sustained VT, or (2) maximal left ventricular (LV) wall thickness above 30 mm, or
extensive fibrosis on CMR (above 10% of total myocardial volume), or (3) high risk of SCD
(>7.5%/5y) as determined by HCM risk-SCD8 score.
Healthy control group I (Healthy) was designed to include individuals who were free from
structural heart disease and arrhythmogenic substrate in ventricles. The inclusion criterion
required evaluation by a cardiac electrophysiologist for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia.
Exclusion criteria were diagnosed structural heart disease, or known risk factors of structural
heart disease9 (history of hypertension, smoking, diabetes, body mass index < 18.5 or >30 kg/m2,
and family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnosed at age 50 or younger).

Control group II (post-MI VT-free) included post-MI patients without a history of sustained
ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as shown either by the history of freedom from sustained VT/VF
during at least one generator life of primary prevention ICD, or medical record.
Control group III (post-MI VT) included post-MI patients with arrhythmogenic substrate as
proven by the history of sudden cardiac arrest and implanted secondary prevention ICD, or, if
ICD was implanted for primary prevention of SCD, and there was documented sustained (cycle
length < 240ms) VT/VF event treated by appropriate ICD shock. MADIT-RIT programming
criteria were applied, to avoid inclusion of treated non-sustained VT events. Sudden cardiac
arrest due to a transient cause was an exclusion criterion.
In addition, exclusion criteria for all study participants were the age of less than 18y,
pregnancy, persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic (above 5%) right ventricular (RV) or
biventricular pacing, renal insufficiency with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30
ml/min, congenital heart disease, and contraindications for CMR or cardiac computed
tomography (CT) with contrast. By design, we planned to enroll 10 participants in each group.
Cardiac imaging and assessment of cardiac structure and function
Healthy controls underwent non-contrast CMR using a Siemens TIM Trio 3 Tesla with VB17
software and Siemens Prisma Fit 3 Tesla scanner with E11C software. The other three groups
underwent prospectively ECG-triggered contrast-enhanced 256-detector row cardiac CT (Philips
iCT, Philips Medical Imaging, Cleveland, OH). The images were acquired in mid to end diastole
with a slice thickness of 0.6 mm and in-plane resolution of approximately 0.5 mm. All cardiac
CT and CMR images were reviewed by a cardiologist (DMG) and ventricular volumes were
obtained in a semiautomatic fashion using commercially available software (IntelliSpace Portal;
Philips Healthcare, Redmond, WA, USA; and CVI42; Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc.,

Calgary, Alberta, Canada). The standardized myocardial segmentation and nomenclature10 were
used to define 17 segments of LV.
Additionally, data from the most recent echocardiogram was abstracted to provide additional
information on baseline cardiac structure and function. For subjects who underwent CMR, left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated from ventricular volume measurements. For
all other individuals, LVEF was calculated from the echocardiogram using the biplane Simpson
method of discs. Regional LV function was evaluated by the echocardiographic wall motion
score index. Motion and systolic thickening in each segment were scored as: normal or
hyperkinesis = 1, hypokinesis = 2, akinesis = 3, and dyskinesis (or aneurysmal) = 4. Wall motion
score index was calculated as the sum of all scores divided by the number of visualized
segments. Resting peak LVOT gradient was calculated for all participants. In addition, HCM
participants had peak LVOT gradient measured during Valsalva maneuver and at peak exertion.
Body surface potentials recording and ECG electrodes localization
A routine clinical resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded during the study
visit, and ECG metrics were measured by the 12 SL algorithm (GE Marquette Electronics,
Milwaukee, WI).
Unipolar ECG potentials were recorded on the body surface using the ActiveTwo
biopotential measurement system (BioSemi, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) with 128 Ag/AgCL
electrodes (4 panels of 32 electrodes; each panel is arranged as four strips of 8-electrodes;
diameter of the ECG electrodes 5 mm), as previously described.11 The sampling rate of the signal
was 16,384 Hz; bandwidth DC-3,200 Hz. ECG electrodes were localized by three-dimensional
(3D) photography approach, using a Kinect camera (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA), as

previously reported.11 In addition, for co-registration of torso images, five CMR- or CT- specific
markers were placed on each patient’s chest during scanning, to mark ECG electrodes locations.
Reconstruction of torso and heart meshes
We constructed 3D meshes of a continuous surface of the endocardium (excluding papillary
muscles) and epicardium of both ventricular chambers. The 3D heart and torso meshes were
reconstructed using a semi-automatic approach – image growing method of a continuous
surface11, 12 from CMR/CT images using ITK-snap software (PICSL, USA).13 Each cardiac mesh
was manually reviewed to ensure a continuous segmentation of epicardium and endocardium of
both ventricular chambers and exclude atria chambers and papillary muscles. Both torsi meshes
segmented by the 3D photography method, and DICOM images were matched using the coregistered CMR/CT markers and electrode position, as previously described.11 The resolution of
the cardiac mesh was 3.6 ± 0.5 mm with 3992 ± 735 nodes.
Inverse solution and reconstruction of the cardiac activation map
The workflow is shown in Figure 1. One clean normal sinus beat was selected for analysis;
an absence of extrasystole before and after selected beat was verified. We used the open-source
SCIRun problem-solving environment developed at the Center for Integrative Biomedical
Computing (University of Utah, UT),14, 15 which was previously used to compute forward and
inverse solutions16 and reconstruct unipolar epicardial and endocardial electrograms (EGMs).
The inverse problem was solved as the potential-based formulation (boundary element method),
as a weighted minimum norm problem by applying a Tikhonov L2-norm regularization.
The steepest downslope of each unipolar EGM was determined automatically, using
MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) software application. Then, each pair of
neighboring unipolar EGMs together with resulting bipolar EGM (calculated as their difference)

was reviewed by at least two investigators (AW, KY, NMR, EAPA) blinded to the study groups
assignment, to verify the consistency of morphology and the steepest downslope detection
(Figure 2). Unipolar EGMs were excluded from further analysis in case of disagreement between
all 3 EGMs. Recalculation of the steepest downslope was performed in case of morphology
agreement but steepest downslope disagreement detection. For calculation of the time reference
point, the three limb leads (I, II, and III) were used to define the averaged QRS onset on the
surface ECG. Local activation time (LAT) in each node of the mesh was calculated as the time
difference between averaged (surface ECG) QRS onset and the time of the steepest downslope
on a corresponding unipolar EGM. To reconstruct cardiac activation map on the epicardial and
endocardial surface, LAT was plotted in each epicardial and endocardial node.
Unipolar voltage potential map
Unipolar voltage was measured in each reconstructed EGM, and a unipolar voltage potential
maps were constructed. The peak-to-peak voltage on each unipolar EGM was automatically
measured using MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) software application. An accuracy
of unipolar EGM peaks detection was validated by investigators (AW, KY, NMR, EAPA)
blinded to groups assignment. We used the standardized myocardial segmentation and
nomenclature10 to define 17 segments of LV. Mean unipolar voltage was calculated for each
segment. RV endocardial surface in 5 segments (basal anteroseptal and inferoseptal, mid-cavity
anteroseptal and inferoseptal, and apical septal) served as an “epicardial” surface of LV.
Standard deviation (SD) of unipolar voltage distribution in each segment served as a measure of
voltage dispersion within each segment.

Ventricular Conduction Velocity
Ventricular conduction velocity between each pair of neighboring nodes was calculated as a
distance between nodes divided by the difference in LATs between corresponding nodes. Mean
conduction velocity was calculated for each LV segment.10 RV endocardial surface in 5
segments (basal anteroseptal and inferoseptal, mid-cavity anteroseptal and inferoseptal, and
apical septal) served as an “epicardial” surface of LV. Dispersion of conduction velocity was
measured as SD of ventricular conduction velocity in each segment.
Statistical analysis
Statistics of normally distributed variables are summarized as mean ± SD. Distributions of all
variables were reviewed. Outliers of ventricular conduction velocity representing nonphysiological values (> 100cm/s) were removed from further analyses. After verifying the
normality of distribution, we tested the hypothesis that the means (mean voltage and mean
conduction velocity) are the same across four study groups while removing the assumption of
equal covariance matrices. The Wald chi-squared statistic with James’s approximation17 was
used to calculate P-values.
We used a Kruskal–Wallis test of the hypothesis that four study groups are from the same
population, to compare voltage and velocity dispersions (measured as an SD of velocity and
voltage in each of 17 segments10), which have a non-normal distribution. Non normally
distributed variables are summarized as the median and interquartile range (IQR).
A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed
using STATA MP 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).

Results
Study population
Clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Most of HCM patients
(80%) had previously undergone genetic testing. The definitive, disease-causing MYHBPC3
mutation was found in 2 patients. Half of the HCM participants had survived a sudden cardiac
arrest, and another half had documented the history of sustained VT/VF. While half of the HCM
patients had a history of severe LVOT obstruction (up to 153 mmHg at peak exertion), they had
already undergone surgical myectomy, resulting in vastly improved LVOT gradients (provoked
peak LVOT gradient 20±20 mmHg), at the time of enrollment.
In VT-free post-MI group, the scar was located in the anteroseptal region in 90% of
participants. In post-MI VT group, the scar was located in the inferoposterior region in 40% and
anteroseptal in 60%. Single-chamber ICD was implanted in approximately 50% of groups II-III
controls, and HCM. The other half of the population had a dual-chamber ICD implanted.
LV systolic function was normal in healthy controls and HCM participants, whereas
ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) with reduced LVEF was confirmed for both post-MI groups
(Table 1).
Mean unipolar voltage and unipolar voltage dispersion
A representative example of a voltage map is shown in Figure 3A. Mean unipolar voltage
(Supplemental Table 1 and Figure 4) was significantly different across all 4 study groups in basal
anteroseptal and apical septal segments, on both sides of septum – LV and RV endocardium.
Also, a significant difference in voltage across all four groups was observed on both endocardial
and epicardial surface of basal anterior and anterolateral segments, the endocardial surface of
anterior apical segment, and the epicardial surface of basal inferior and mid-inferolateral

segments. Healthy individuals had the smallest mean unipolar voltage, whereas HCM was
characterized by the largest voltage (Figure 4). Unipolar voltage in two post-MI groups was
similar, and had intermediate values, as compared to healthy and HCM participants.
Voltage dispersion was significantly smaller in healthy controls, as compared to the other
three groups (Supplemental Table 2 and Figure 5). Remarkably, in several segments, voltage
dispersion in HCM was the highest amongst all four groups, significantly exceeding voltage
dispersion in both ICM groups. The unipolar voltage dispersion was significantly different across
study groups in both endocardial and epicardial segments in basal anterior, basal anterolateral
and inferolateral, apical inferior, and the epicardial surface of the apex.
Mean ventricular conduction velocity and velocity dispersion
A representative example of the activation map is shown in Figure 3B. In Healthy controls,
we observed a normal activation pattern, which initiated in the septal region and propagated from
endocardium to epicardium, with several breakthroughs – near the RV apex and anterior
paraseptal aspects of the epicardium in regions adjacent to the left anterior descendent coronary
artery. Activation proceeded from apex to the inferior basal area in both RV and LV, with the
inferolateral LV base and the region near right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) being the latest
to activate.
Overall, mean conduction velocity was mostly similar in all 4 study groups (Supplemental
Table 4 and Figure 6). In most LV segments, there was no difference in mean conduction
velocity in healthy as compared to both ICM groups. Mean conduction velocity was significantly
slower in HCM participants as compared to other groups in endocardial basal anterior, and
epicardial basal inferior, basal anterolateral, apical anterior, and apical septal segments.

Overall, velocity dispersion was largely similar across all four study groups. Velocity
dispersion in HCM participants was significantly greater than in the other three groups only in
one segment: RV endocardial surface corresponding to the basal anteroseptal segment
(Supplemental Table 4).
Discussion
Our study revealed important features of EP substrate in HCM, which differentiate HCM
substrate from ICM substrate in patients with VT history and post-MI scar located in the same
areas (anterior and anteroseptal segments). HCM is characterized by significantly slower mean
ventricular conduction velocity in many basal and apical segments, as compared to ICM. Areas
of relatively slow ventricular conduction in HCM are large, and overall ventricular conduction
slowing in HCM being diffuse. At the same time, the degree of ventricular conduction slowing
was small, and mean ventricular conduction velocity remained within a range of normal values
in all groups. Slow ventricular conduction facilitates the development and maintenance of
reentrant VT. Diffuse nature of EP substrate in HCM may explain the low success rate of VT
ablation in HCM, providing suggestions regarding the likelihood for success of VT ablation as a
standing-alone long-term treatment solution for HCM. In the near future, the HCM registry
study18 may add understanding to the underlying cellular architecture of the myocardium and the
impact of diffuse EP substrate in HCM.
EP substrate and mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in HCM
HCM is the most common monogenic cardiac disease, with the incidence of up to 1 in 200
live births.19 Diagnosis of HCM is challenging, although some preliminary machine learning
studies are promising.20, 21 Previous studies provided inconsistent results about the correlation
between electroanatomical mapping with 3D-imaging in HCM. Aryana et al22 reported a good

correlation between low voltage areas on the map, co-localized with a post-infarction scar in
post-MI patients. However, scattered intramural fibrosis in HCM did not manifest by the low
voltage on endocardial, nor epicardial maps. Reported findings included local conduction delay
or conduction block, fractionated electrograms, and reduced voltage.23 Hutchinson et al24 showed
that unipolar endocardial voltage mapping could accurately identify epicardial scar that is
manifested by reduced unipolar voltage. Schumacher et al23 also reported reduced bipolar
voltage in the septal region in HCM patients.
In contrast, we observed significantly larger unipolar voltage in HCM as compared to healthy
persons or ICM patients, and the difference was especially prominent in HCM-affected regions
of the heart: both endocardial and epicardial basal and apical septal segments. The different
methodology of voltage mapping may explain the observed discrepancy between our results and
previous contact mapping studies. Our study is the first to report endocardial and epicardial
voltage in HCM obtained by inverse solutions. A previous HCM case report25 describing ECGi
findings did not provide results of voltage map in its HCM patient. Consistently with our
findings, Yoshida et al26 in 1986 conducted body surface isopotential mapping and showed that
HCM patients have significantly larger peak-to-peak voltage than patients with LVH due to
essential hypertension.
We showed a greater degree of voltage dispersion in HCM as compared to post-MI patients
in both endocardial and the epicardial segments in basal anterior, basal anterolateral and
inferolateral, apical inferior, and the epicardial surface of the apex. This finding may be
explained by an underlying phenomenon of diffused interstitial fibrosis in HCM, generating
greater voltage dispersion as compared to patchy post-MI fibrosis. Further MRI studies18
utilizing late gadolinium enhancement and T1-mapping are needed to evaluate the agreement

between voltage dispersion on ECGi voltage map and imaging-defined type of fibrosis, and their
associations with clinical outcomes in HCM patients. HCM is characterized by a disorganized
sarcomeric alignment, which can augment nonuniform anisotropic conduction, creating a
substrate for reentry (both slow conduction and unidirectional block).27 Disorganized bundles of
ventricular fibers can lead to asymmetry in conduction. An impulse conducting in one direction
meets a different sequence of muscle branching and changes in muscle bundle diameter, as
compared to an impulse conducting in the opposite direction. Such asymmetry affects the sourcesink relationships.28
Our findings are consistent with previous clinical observations in HCM, indicating that
neither myectomy nor alcohol septal ablation reduces risk of SCD or VT. Most of HCM patients
who undergo myectomy, develop left bundle branch block, and approximately a quarter of HCM
patients who underwent alcohol septal ablation develop complete heart block.29 Few case reports
showed that a scar formed after alcohol septal ablation could serve as a substrate for reentrant
VT30. Thus, surgical HCM treatment may reduce heart failure symptoms but do not change SCD
risk in HCM. Diffuse nature of ventricular conduction slowing in HCM explains these previous
clinical observations. Regardless of the type of intervention targeting reduction of septal
thickness, diffused conduction slowing maintains pro-arrhythmic substrate facilitating the
development of life-threatening reentrant VT.
Noninvasive mapping of ventricular activation
In this study, we used the Forward/Inverse problem toolkit from the SCIRun problem-solving
environment, which is used by many investigators in the field.14, 15, 31, 32 However, knowing the
limitations of ECGi method,33 we intentionally limited our analysis by averaged “per segment”
data. Duchateau et al33 observed mean activation time error of approximately 20 ms. In this

study, we observed ventricular activation dispersion of approximately 20 cm/s in all study
participants, including healthy controls, with no meaningful differences in ventricular activation
dispersion between groups. Therefore, we interpret that ventricular activation dispersion in our
study quantifies an error of local ventricular conduction velocity measurement between two
nods. Thus, we accept that actual ventricular conduction velocity can be on average either higher
or lower by 20 cm/s. This study error precludes interpretations of specific ventricular conduction
phenomena, yet our findings still provide insight into HCM mechanisms.
Limitations
A case-control study is susceptible to bias. We selected only high-risk HCM patients, and our
HCM cases sample may not be representative of all HCM patients. To minimize selection bias,
all control groups were enrolled in the same single center. Further development of inverse
solution noninvasive activation mapping method is needed to enable interpretation of local
ventricular activation patterns.
