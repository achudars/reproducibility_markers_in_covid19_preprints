Abstract

Freezing of gait (FOG), a devastating symptom of Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD), can be refractory to
current treatments such as medication and open‚Äêloop deep brain stimulation (olDBS). Recent
evidence suggests that closed‚Äêloop DBS (clDBS), using beta local field potential power from the
subthalamic nucleus (STN) as the control variable, can improve tremor and bradykinesia;
however, no study has investigated the use of clDBS for the treatment of FOG. In this study, we
provide preliminary evidence that clDBS was superior to olDBS in reducing percent time freezing
and in reducing freezing behavior (gait arrhythmicity) in two people with PD and FOG, with less
total energy delivered. These findings warrant further investigation into the use of clDBS to treat
FOG while also minimizing the total energy delivered to maintain a therapeutic effect.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating symptom of Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD), affecting over half
of the patient population [1] and drastically impacting mobility and patient quality of life. These
symptoms have been difficult to treat with dopaminergic medications, and they can become
refractory over time [2]. Moreover, it is debated how much deep brain stimulation (DBS)
provided in an open‚Äêloop manner (olDBS) can mitigate FOG [3]‚Äì[5].

Closed‚Äêloop deep brain stimulation (clDBS) has been demonstrated to alleviate the signs and
symptoms of PD by adjusting stimulation in response to elevations in local field potential (LFP)
beta band power in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Improvements in tremor and bradykinesia on
clDBS have been observed using beta power as the control variable in both single and dual
threshold algorithms [6]‚Äì[8]. To date, no study has used similar closed‚Äêloop paradigms to reduce
FOG, although we have shown that STN olDBS attenuated pathological beta fluctuations while
improving FOG [9]. In this paper, we demonstrate preliminary evidence that clDBS driven by STN
beta band power was superior to conventional olDBS in reducing the percent time freezing during
a stepping in place task on dual force plates.

Methods

Two male participants with PD and FOG symptoms participated in the study. Both participants
were implanted with an investigative sensing neurostimulator (Medtronic Activa¬Æ PC+S, FDA IDE
approved) and bilateral STN DBS leads (Medtronic model 3389). All procedures were approved

by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board and participants provided informed written
consent.

Participants performed a stepping in place (SIP) task [10] during three stimulation conditions: off
DBS (OFF), on open‚Äêloop DBS (olDBS), and on closed‚Äêloop DBS (clDBS). All testing was performed
in the off medication state (refrained for 12 hours for short‚Äê and 24 and 48 hours for long‚Äêacting
dopaminergic medication). The clDBS was modulated by the power of the local field potentials
contained in beta frequency range (13‚Äê30 Hz) [6].

The dual threshold control algorithm

parameters (beta thresholds) were determined from beta band power during movement as
opposed to during the resting state. Movement band beta power was measured during voltage
titration in 5 voltage increments performed between 0 and 100% of VMax while stepping in place.
The movement bandwidth was 3‚Äê4 Hz around the peak frequency of elevated beta band power
during SIP [9], [11]. The maximum voltage that provided clinical improvement without side
effects (VMax) in each STN was determined for each participant. A single beta threshold was used
for Participant 1 based on the movement band power measured at 0% and VMax for the left and
right STNs, respectively. The upper and lower values of the dual threshold controller for
Participant 2 were set to the average beta measured during the stepping in place task at VMax
(upper threshold) and the minimum voltage (VMin) that showed improvement in stepping and
freezing behavior (lower threshold, 25% of VMax). For Participant 1, the stimulation settings for
olDBS were set to VMax for each STN, while the settings of olDBS for Participant 2 were set to the
average voltage observed in each STN during the clDBS condition.

Freezing events were detected offline using an automated algorithm [10]. FOG and freezing
behavior were assessed using the percent time freezing during the task and SIP arrhythmicity
(coefficient of variation (CV) of stride time), respectively. Total electrical energy delivered (TEED)
was calculated for both olDBS and clDBS using the following equation:

where V = stimulation voltage, p = stimulation pulse width, f = stimulation frequency, t = time,
and Z = electrode impedance.

Results

Both participants experienced FOG in the off‚Äêstimulation (OFF) condition as their stepping
behavior began to break down (i.e., loss of force modulation), Figure 1A and B.

During olDBS there was improvement in the duration of normal stepping but FOG episodes were
still detected for both participants, Fig. 1C and D. During clDBS, no FOG was detected for
Participant 1, Fig. 1E, and only a short start hesitation episode was detected for Participant 2, Fig.
1F. The percent time freezing was: 36.4% OFF DBS, 0.94% during olDBS, and 0% during clDBS for
Participant 1, and: 68.7% OFF DBS, 23.5% during olDBS, and 1.5% during clDBS for Participant 2.
SIP arrhythmicity also improved during DBS, with Participant 1 having slightly more improvement

during clDBS compared to olDBS (Participant 1: 30.4% OFF, 16.3% olDBS, 15.6%

clDBS;

Participant 2: 20.4% OFF, 10.4% olDBS, 13.1% clDBS). In addition to the improvements in
behavior, TEED was lower in the clDBS conditions compared to olDBS, with a larger reduction
being observed in Participant 2 (Participant 1: 5%, Participant 2: 46%).

Discussion

These findings, to the best of our knowledge, are the first to demonstrate that neural closed‚Äêloop
stimulation (clDBS) was superior to open loop DBS (olDBS) and no stimulation (OFF) in reducing
FOG in PD. Freezing behavior, manifesting as arrhythmic stepping and lack of maintaining a
consistent rate of force/amplitude control during stepping (i.e., the ‚Äúsequence effect‚Äù[12], [13]),
also improved more during clDBS compared to olDBS and OFF DBS. Interestingly, similar
improvements were observed using both a single (Participant 1) and dual‚Äêthreshold (Participant
2) algorithm aside from a larger reduction in TEED using the dual threshold algorithm compared
to the single threshold algorithm. Future investigations should evaluate how much the system
needs to adapt to maintain a therapeutic effect while also minimizing the energy needed.

The most dramatic effects observed in this study were the decrease in FOG and improvement in
sustained stepping by clDBS, especially compared to conventional olDBS. These findings suggest
that allowing the stimulation to adapt during the trial may allow the motor system to sustain or
regain movement control, whereas continuous stimulation cannot prevent the ‚Äúsequence effect‚Äù
[12] because it is not changing in response to the oscillations of neural activity in the STN. Overall,

these findings warrant further investigation into the use of clDBS for improving FOG as well as
other Parkinsonian symptoms.
