ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate neuroanatomical correlates of memory impairment 30-90
days after stroke, including the role of white matter connections in the core circuit for
episodic memory.
Methods: A cohort of 179 patients with first symptomatic ischaemic stroke were
enrolled into a longitudinal cognitive study, STRATEGIC. Verbal and visual memory
were assessed at 50±19 (range 22-109) days. Lesion topography was defined by
imaging (n=152). In a representative subgroup (n=53), 3T MRI and tractography was
used to define patterns of tract injury and microstructure of uninjured tracts.
Results: Lesion location, defined by arterial territory, was associated with verbal
memory impairment (F(12,164)=2.62, p=0.003), independent of other factors such as
age, risk factor status and lesion volume. Independent lesion symptom mapping
identified regions of the left posterior temporal white matter, within the left posterior
cerebral artery territory, associated specifically with verbal recall. Visual recognition
memory was associated with microstructure of the uninjured fornix but not with lesion
location.
Conclusions: Infarct location strongly influenced verbal recall performance 50 days
after stroke. Damage in two locations underpinned this relationship: the thalamus;
and within the left PCA territory, where disconnection of parahippocampal white
matter projections contributed to verbal memory impairment in some cases. The
correlates of early cognitive prognosis were domain-specific with a different pattern
of associations with executive function. The association between microstructure of
the uninjured fornix and visual memory might reflect the effects of comorbid
pathology on hippocampal circuits.

BACKGROUND
Memory difficulty is a common sequel of stroke. 43% of stroke survivors in the
community report memory difficulties1 and objective deficits are confirmed in
approximately a quarter of patients by neuropsychological tests2. Memory
dysfunction is an unmet need1 and, in a proportion of patients, goes on to become a
cornerstone of post-stroke dementia3.

The importance of lesion location in post-stroke memory impairment is incompletely
understood. Investigation in large cohorts has often been limited to crude
localisation, classifying lesions by hemisphere or cerebral lobes2. Conversely,
descriptions of strategic locations are derived highly selected case series, so that the
importance of these strategic infarct syndromes on a more representative scale is not
clear.

In the healthy brain, verbal episodic memory is supported by the extended
hippocampal network, which includes anterior thalamic nuclei, mammillary bodies
and also key connections between these structures4, 5. The fornix is the major route
of connection between the hippocampus and diencephalic, basal forebrain and
prefrontal regions5. In older adults, fornix microstructure is the main correlate of recall
performance6. Posterior parahippocampal projections also support verbal memory in
the normal brain7 and become increasingly important in individuals with early
memory symptoms8. The fornix is rarely affected by ischaemic injury but is highly
susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease with structural alterations that are well established
by the emergence of first symptoms8-10. Parahippocampal connections, in contrast,
are often injured by infarction in the middle and posterior cerebral artery territories.

AIMS
This article is based on analysis of data from the first subacute follow-up time point of
STRATEGIC. The objective was to define factors associated with verbal and visual
memory after stroke. In a subgroup, diffusion MRI was acquired to determine the
extent to which undamaged connections, known to be important to memory in the
healthy brain, might contribute to prognosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design and Participants
Patients with first symptomatic ischaemic stroke were recruited within 7 days of onset
from a single stroke centre. Inclusion criteria were: age over 50; clinical,
supratentorial stroke corroborated by CT or MRI. Exclusion criteria were: previous
stroke (clinical or old large-artery infarct on imaging); existing diagnosis of dementia;
lack of fluency in English; active malignancy; major neurological or psychiatric
disease (defined by DSM-IV-TR); previous moderate to severe head injury (Mayo
clinic classification of severity); lack of capacity to consent (including aphasia); other
factors precluding cognitive evaluation (e.g. severe visual impairment). Consecutive
patients meeting these criteria were invited to take part. Stroke subtype was
established based on the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke (TOAST) criteria, using
information from brain imaging and other etiological investigations. All participants
gave written, informed consent. The study was approved by the London and Bromley
Research Ethics Committee (ref: 13-LO-1745) and is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03982147).

Stroke subtyping, risk factors and infarct delineation
Patients were invited to return for follow-up at a target interval of 30-60 days after
stroke (study flowchart, Supplemental Figure I, mean±S.D. interval from onset
49.8±19.3 days, range 22-109 days). Investigation results and risk factor status were
reviewed and etiological subtypes of stroke verified or updated. Atrial fibrillation (AF)
was defined as >7 mins AF measured by either admission ECG or subsequent
prolonged recordings. Carotid stenosis was defined by greater than 50% vessel
narrowing on either Doppler ultrasound or CT angiography. Ischaemic heart disease
(IHD) was defined by a history of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery
intervention. Smoking and hypertension were defined by self-report. Infarcts involving
cortex were classified into anterior (ACA), middle (MCA), or posterior (PCA) cerebral
artery territories. The MCA territory was further subdivided into anterior, posterior or
deep (striatocapsular territory). Non-thalamic lacunar lesions were defined as lesions
in the white matter or deep grey matter with a diameter less than 15mm. Severity of
white matter disease on clinical images was graded using the Fazekas scale (see
Supplemental Material)12.

Cognitive Evaluation
Six tests was performed at the initial visit: the National Adult Reading Test Revised
(NART-R)13, to estimate premorbid intellectual function; Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA)14; Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), a measure of
information processing speed and executive function15; Trail-making Test; Digit Span,
an index of working memory15; and The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Task
(FCSRT)16. The FCSRT provided the principal evaluation of verbal episodic memory.
In this test, participants learn 16 written words presented on 4 cards, each with 4
words belonging to 4 semantic categories, with three rounds or recall, giving a

maximum score of 48 for each participant. Additional neuropsychological evaluation
of memory was performed in the patients with research MRI (see below), using the
Doors and People Test17, and a Face Recognition Test of visual memory based on
the CAL/PAL Face Database18,19.

Memory-Tractography Substudy
Patients without contraindications to MRI were invited to take part in a research MRI
substudy. Scans were performed on a 3T MR750 MR scanner (GE Healthcare)
67.6±16.5 days after onset(range 30-95 days). T2-weighted fast recovery fast spin
echo (FRFSE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences were
acquired to delineate infarcts and other vascular lesions (see Supplemental
Methods). Lesions were drawn manually by a single rater (PW) using FLAIR
images20 and tract damage from infarction was inferred from assessing overlap with
the JHU white matter atlas.

Diffusion images (see Supplemental Methods for details on acquisition, preprocessing and tractography) were processed as in previous studies8. The fornix and
parahippocampal cingulum (left and right) were reconstructed with tractography8, and
used to derive tract-specific measures of microstructure. In two patients with lesions
adjacent to the fimbria-fornix on one side, fornix reconstruction was limited to the
undamaged hemisphere only.

Analysis and Statistics
The first analysis tested associations with lesion location by vascular territory (7
regions per hemisphere). Clinical and demographic variables found to have
significant univariate associations with cognitive scores (potential confounders for

associations between location and cognition) were added as covariates in a
univariate General Linear Model for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Identical
covariates were used to generate comparable models for each of the three cognitive
scores.

To corroborate this approach, and to test for anatomical associations at a more finegrained anatomical level, lesion-symptom mapping was performed using anatomical
labels from the AAL and Catani white matter atlases, defining 150 regions of interest
per brain. This analysis included 152 of 179 patients with identifiable lesions.
Standard space images were analysed using NiiStat
(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/niistat/). Differences in verbal recall, DSST and MoCA
scores between damaged and intact groups, for each region, were tested using twosample t-tests, with each score analysed separately. Significance values were
corrected using permutation testing with 5000 permutations21 (further details in
Supplemental Material). Finally, lesion-symptom mapping was also applied to test for
associations at the single voxel level.

RESULTS
General factors associated with cognition
Verbal recall scores varied significantly by lesion territory (Table 2). Left thalamic and
left PCA lesions were both associated with poor verbal recall (Figure 1). An ANOCA
model revealed an association between vascular territory and verbal recall that was
independent of covariates (F(12,164)=2.62, p=0.003). Lesion vascular territory was
not, however, associated with executive function (DSST) or global cognition (MoCA).
DSST score was associated with the extent of white matter lesions and diabetes
mellitus (Table 2), with DSST scores decreasing monotonically with increasing
Fazekas score (Supplementary Figure IV).

Regional Lesion-symptom mapping
Sites of injury associated with verbal recall were limited to the left hemisphere. Four
regions met the permutation-corrected threshold for significance: the left
hippocampus (z = -3.24), the left thalamus (z = -3.75), the left cingulum (z = -3.32)
and the left inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus (z = -3.54). Executive function was
associated with damage in the right hippocampus (z = -3.25) right parahippocampal
gyrus (z = -3.49) and right cingulum (z = -3.76). Voxel-level analysis revealed a
similar pattern with only a cluster in the left thalamus reaching whole brain
significance.

Uninjured Connections and Memory: the Fornix
Visual recognition memory scores correlated with mean diffusivity of the unaffected
fornix (face recognition total hits, r = -.38, p < .01; remembered hits r = -.45, p < .001;
Doors and People verbal recognition r = -.30, p < .05; visual recognition r = -.23,

p = .058). Fornix microstructure was not associated with verbal recall, creating a
double dissociation for verbal and visual memory (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
In a sample of 179 patients with first symptomatic ischaemic stroke, lesion location
was found to have the strongest influence on verbal recall performance in the first
three months after stroke. Lesion location, represented by vascular territory,
remained a significant factor after accounting for other variables in a multi-variable
model. In contrast, vascular territory was not associated with executive function
(DSST) or MoCA score. An independent lesion-symptom mapping analysis
evaluated 150 regions in the brain and identified critical white matter regions within
the left PCA territory. Age, smoking and infarct volume were associated with
cognitive function in univariate analyses but these associations were not sustained
once other variables were taken into account, which is consistent with previous
investigations2.

The role of posterior temporal white matter pathways in memory has been a topic of
controversy23. One previous case series suggested that unilateral posterior temporal
infarction was sufficient to cause amnesia24. However, this series was based on
1980s CT imaging only, which provides limited sensitivity to hippocampal injury. A
subsequent study of experimental PCA lesions in the macaque suggested that
memory was only impaired when the hippocampus was injured25. The present
analysis was able to exclude involvement of the hippocampus in most cases and
reasserts the message that damage to posterior temporal white matter can cause
marked verbal memory impairment in the absence of overt hippocampal injury24. The

most likely substrate – supported by analysis of a number of individual cases in this
cohort (Figure 4) – is damage to the parahippocampal portion of the left cingulum
bundle (left PHC) which has been found to have a role in verbal memory in healthy
volunteers8. Interestingly, the left PHC seems to have a disproportionate importance
for supporting memory in individuals who have already developed mild cognitive
impairment8. Memory deficits in patients with left PCA lesions were often
unrecognised clinically, perhaps because the hippocampus was not obviously
injured. This illustrates the importance of awareness of the risk of memory
dysfunction in patients with left PCA infarction.

At a single voxel-level only a cluster of voxels within the left thalamus retained
significant association with verbal recall. Executive function was associated with a
distinct set of regions in the right hemisphere. Although the study lacked the power to
infer relationships with cognition at a single-voxel level, it still represents an
approximate 20-fold improvement in the anatomical precision of associations
between lesion location and cognition, which in previous literature was limited to
location by hemisphere or lobe of the brain, in contrast to a parcellation of the brain
into 150 separate regions in the regional lesion-symptom mapping analysis.

Microstructure of the fornix correlated with visual recognition memory performance
independent of lesion volume and location. Measurements of fornix microstructure
were restricted to undamaged white matter. These results indicate that both the
direct effects of injury and the status of critical connections remote from injury
contributed to the profile of memory impairment. One possible interpretation is that
secondary degeneration of the fornix, caused by the index infarct, had already
developed when imaging took place at 30-90 days. This explanation seems unlikely

as fornix microstructure was not associated with volume of infarction or the interval
between clinical onset and imaging. An alternative explanation is that the
microstructure of the fornix provides a potential biomarker of early neurodegenerative
pathology9, 10. Population-based studies suggest that undiagnosed mild cognitive
impairment may be present in up to 37% in individuals aged 70-90 years26.

The current sample was limited to patients who had capacity to consent and who
could perform cognitive tests involving reading, writing and verbal responses. Thus,
our findings do not extend to patients with more severe strokes or specific deficits
such as aphasia or alexia. The current analyses show that approximately 30% of the
variance in verbal memory at 30-90 days can be accounted for by the features of the
incident infarct, structure of important connections, and background factors such as
age and risk factor status. The extent to which secondary or independent structural
changes in the cortex, thalamus or striatum – assessed, for example, by cortical
thickness measurements and assays of vascular lesions not visible on 3T MRI – are
able to account for additional variance in cognitive outcome is an important topic for
future analyses. A limitation of lesion symptom mapping approaches is that the
power to make inferences about any one region depends on frequency of
involvement of that region. In the present study, there were more lesions, and
therefore more power, in the right hemisphere. The lateralisation of associations with
executive function is likely to reflect this factor. The current study only included
patients with a single large artery lesion and therefore cannot elucidate additive or
synergistic impairments from multiple lesions. This important issue would require a
much larger study sample to address using multivariate statistical methods.
