Confounding adjustment performance of ordinal analysis methods in stroke studies

v5.3 dd 24-10-2018

Abstract
Background In acute stroke studies, ordinal logistic regression (OLR) is often used to analyze outcome on the
modified Rankin Scale (mRS), whereas the non-parametric Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (MWS) has also
been suggested. It is unclear how these perform comparatively when confounding adjustment is warranted. Our
aim is to quantify the performance of OLR and MWS in different confounding variable settings.

Methods We set up a simulation study with three different scenarios; (1) dichotomous confounding variables, (2)
continuous confounding variables, and (3) confounding variable settings mimicking a study on functional outcome
after stroke. We compared adjusted ordinal logistic regression (aOLR) and stratified Mann-Whitney measure of
superiority (sMWS), and also used propensity scores to stratify the MWS (psMWS). For comparability, OLR
estimates were transformed to a MWS. We report bias, the percentage of runs that produced a point estimate
deviating by more than 0.05 points (point estimate variation), and the coverage probability.

Results In scenario 1, there was no bias in both sMWS and aOLR, with similar point estimate variation and coverage
probabilities. In scenario 2, sMWS resulted in more bias (0.04 versus 0.00), and higher point estimate variation
(41.6% versus 3.3%), whereas coverage probabilities were similar. In scenario 3, there was no bias in both methods,
point estimate variation was higher in the sMWS (6.7%) versus aOLR (1.1%), and coverage probabilities were 0.98
(sMWS) versus 0.95 (aOLR). With psMWS, bias remained 0.00, with less point estimate variation (1.5%) and a
coverage probability of 0.95.

Conclusions The bias of both adjustment methods was similar in our stroke simulation scenario, and the higher
point estimate variation in the MWS improved with propensity score based stratification. The stratified MWS is a
valid alternative for adjusted OLR only when the ratio of number of strata versus number of observations is
relatively low, but propensity score based stratification extends the application range of the MWS.

Confounding adjustment performance of ordinal analysis methods in stroke studies

Introduction
The ordinal modified Rankin Scale (mRS) measures functional outcome after stroke on a 7-step scale from 0 (no
symptoms) to 6 (death), and is the primary outcome measure in most acute stroke trials.(1) To analyze the
differences in mRS between treatment arms, pivotal stroke trials primarily use the ordinal logistic regression (OLR)
method.(2-4) The OLR produces a single effect size estimate (a common odds ratio) based on the odds ratios for
each cut-point across the mRS, and this estimate can be interpreted as the odds ratio of ending up in a higher
category of the scale. But as OLR is based on several assumptions, such as a linear and proportional effect of the
independent variables on the outcome variable,(5) the Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (MWS) was recently
proposed as a more robust analysis method of an ordinal outcome scale.(6) In contrast to regression methods, the
MWS is a non-parametric rank-based test based on proversions, which are one to one comparisons of outcome
between observations. In short, each observation in one group (A) is compared to each observation in the other
group (B), and the following three complementary probabilities (Ps) are derived: P(A>B), P(A=B), and P(B>A). The
MWS for A is then given by the formula P(A>B) + 0.5P(A=B). As a result, the MWS ranges from 0 to 1, with 0.5 as
the value of no difference between groups A and B.
Importantly, OLR and MWS differ fundamentally in their confounding adjustment technique. In regression methods
such as the OLR, independent variables can be added to the equation. However, these models are also subject to
aforementioned assumptions. As a non-parametric method, the MWS uses stratification for confounding
adjustment: the basic concept is that the proversions are performed only within the defined strata. For example,
when adjusting for sex, proversions are only made between males from group A versus males from group B, and
females from group A versus females from group B. Stratification is however linked to estimation problems. Most
notably, residual confounding and instability through empty cells might occur, especially when adjusting for
multiple confounding variables. A possible solution to overcome these issues is to form strata based on percentiles
of propensity scores, which estimate the probability of being exposed based on measured confounding
variables.(7)

It has previously not been investigated how the different adjustment techniques of OLR and MWS perform
comparatively. Our objective was to compare and quantify the bias/variance trade-off of these methods in a
simulation model with varying confounding conditions, focusing on those conditions typically present in an acute
ischemic stroke cohort.

Methods
Scenarios
We generated data in three distinct scenarios, differing from each other only in their confounding variable settings
(table 1). In scenario 1, we modeled five dichotomous confounding variables all with a prevalence of 0.5 and all
with a regression coefficient of ln(1.5) (which is equivalent to an odds ratio of 1.5) in relation to the outcome. In
scenario 2, we modeled five continuous confounding variables, with a standard normal distribution and regression
coefficient of ln(1.5) in relation to the outcome. In scenario 3, we modeled five varying confounding variables, with
distributions and regression coefficients reflecting known important characteristics (sex, age, stroke severity,
previous stroke, systolic blood pressure) associated with functional outcome after stroke.(8, 9) In our main
simulations we generated 1000 observations, which we changed to 250 and 4000 in sensitivity analyses. Each
scenario was run 1000 times. All simulations were performed in Stata/IC 15.1 for Windows (32 bit), with full code
provided in the appendix.

Data generation process
First, we generated a seven-step ordinal outcome variable, based on the presence or value of the confounding
variables and their assumed relationship with the outcome (as specified in the respective scenario). Second, we
constructed a dichotomous exposure variable also based on the confounding variables present, yet conditionally
independent of the outcome. Importantly, we did not model a direct relationship between the exposure variable
and the ordinal outcome variable, nor did we model a correlation between any of the confounding variables. See
appendix 1 for a detailed description of our data generation process and appendix 2 for the full Stata code used.

Comparison of analysis methods
For each run, we performed a crude OLR and MWS analysis, and an adjusted analysis for both methods; regression
adjustment in OLR (aOLR) and stratified adjustment in MWS (sMWS). Ordinal and continuous confounding variables
were stratified based on quartiles; this resulted in up to 32 (2^5) possible strata in scenario 1, up to 1024 (4^5)
possible strata in scenario 2, and up to 256 (2*4*4*2*4) possible strata in scenario 3. We calculated a propensity
score per observation based on all confounding variables present in the respective scenario. This score was

subsequently divided into quartiles for the propensity based stratified MWS (psMWS). For comparison purposes,
we converted the odds ratios (ORs) generated by the OLR to Mann-Whitney measures of superiority, with the
2

following approximation formula: MWS = (OR/(OR-1) ) x ((OR-1)-ln(OR)).(6)

Outcome parameters
The validity of each method is assessed by the extent of the bias, which we defined as the difference between the
mean of the observed point estimates and the simulated, true effect. In order to quantify the variation in (point)
estimates of each method, we report the percentage of runs that produced a point estimate deviating more than
0.05 MWS from the true effect (i.e. an estimate lower than 0.45 or higher than 0.55, roughly equivalent to an OR
lower than 0.74 or higher than 1.35 using the approximation formula stated above). Finally, we also report the
coverage probability, defined as the proportion of 95%- confidence intervals encompassing the true effect. With
our 1000 runs, calculated coverage probabilities within the range of 93.6% - 96.4% are compatible with a true
coverage of 95%. Of note, as the number of proversions decreases when the number of strata increases, there were
no or only very little proversions to construct the MWS estimate in some runs. As this results in extreme estimates
and impossibility to construct a valid confidence interval, we discarded runs that resulted in less than 11

proversions. We created boxplots of the five analysis methods’ (OLR, MWS, aOLR, sMWS, psMWS) point estimates,
th

th

displaying the lower adjacent value, 25 percentile, median, 75 percentile, and upper adjacent value (extreme
outliers not shown).

Results
Scenario 1: Dichotomous confounding variables
In the scenario with five dichotomous confounding variables (resulting in 32 possible strata for sMWS), sMWS and
aOLR performed similar; bias was 0.00 in both methods, and point estimate variation (percentage of runs that
produced a point estimate deviating more than 0.05 MWS from the true effect) was 2.1% in the sMWS versus 1.8%
in the aOLR. The coverage probability was 96% in the sMWS versus 95% in the aOLR. Propensity score based strata
adjustment in the MWS (psMWS) resulted in a bias of 0.01, a point estimate variation of 2.1%, and coverage
probability of 93%. See figure 1 for the boxplots (including the results for 1 to 4 dichotomous confounding
variables).

Scenario 2: Continuous confounding variables
In the scenario with five continuous confounding variables (resulting in 1024 possible strata for sMWS), aOLR
outperformed sMWS; bias was 0.04 in the sMWS versus 0.00 in the aOLR, and point estimate variation was 41.6%
in the sMWS versus 3.3% in the aOLR. The coverage probability was 96% for both methods. With psMWS, bias was
0.02, point estimate variation was 8.1%, and coverage probability was 88%. See figure 2 for the boxplots (including
the results for 1 to 4 continuous confounding variables).

Scenario 3: Varying confounding variables
In the scenario with five varying confounding variables (resulting in 256 possible strata for sMWS), sMWS and aOLR
performed similar; bias was 0.00 in both methods, and point estimate variation was 6.7% in the sMWS versus 1.1%
in the aOLR. The coverage probability was 98% for sMWS and 95% in the aOLR. With psMWS, bias was 0.00, point
estimate variation was 1.5%, and coverage probability was95%. See figure 3 for the boxplots (including the results
for 1 to 4 varying confounding variables).

Varying sample size (table 2)
Sensitivity analyses with 250 observations in scenario 1 resulted in similar bias (sMWS 0.00, aOLR 0.00, psMWS
0.01) and coverage probabilities (sMWS 96%, aOLR 95%, psMWS 96%) as the main analyses, but with higher point

estimate variation (sMWS 30.5%, aOLR 25.0%, psMWS 23.7%). In scenario 2, bias was also similar to the main
analyses (sMWS 0.05, aOLR 0.00, psMWS 0.02), but point estimate variation increased particularly in the sMWS
(91.0% versus 32.2% with aOLR, and 34.5% with psMWS). Coverage probabilities were 100% (sMWS) versus 95%
(aOLR), and 93% in the psMWS. In scenario 3, bias was similar to the main analyses (sMWS 0.01, aOLR 0.00, psMWS
0.00), but point estimate variation increased particularly in the sMWS (58.3% versus 22.5% with aOLR, and 20.4%
with psMWS). Coverage probabilities were 98% (sMWS) versus 94% (aOLR), and 96% in the psMWS.
Sensitivity analyses with 4000 observations in scenario 1 resulted in similar bias (sMWS 0.00, aOLR 0.00, psMWS
0.01) and coverage probabilities (sMWS 95%, aOLR 95%, psMWS 86%), but, as expected, with lower point estimate
variation (all methods 0.0%). In scenario 2, bias was also similar to the main analyses (sMWS 0.03, aOLR 0.00,
psMWS 0.02), and point estimate variation lowered proportionally (sMWS 14.7%, aOLR 0.0%, psMWS 0.1%).
However, the coverage probability was only 49% with sMWS versus 95% with aOLR, and 71% with psMWS. In
scenario 3, bias was 0.00 and point estimate variation was 0.0% in all analysis methods. Coverage probabilities
were 95% (sMWS) versus 94% (aOLR), and 92% in the sMWS.

Discussion
In our simulation scenario with structures of confounding variables based on stroke cohorts (scenario 3), we found
that both stratified MWS (sMWS) and adjusted OLR (aOLR) produced unbiased point estimates. The variation in
point estimates was higher for sMWS, but this was fixed with propensity score based stratification in the MWS
(psMWS). Interestingly, whereas sMWS performed worse than aOLR when modeling fewer observations, but
psMWS produced similar results to aOLR. When modeling a larger number of observations, differences disappeared
and all methods produced unbiased and precise point estimates. In the scenario with dichotomous confounding
variables (scenario 1), both methods performed similar in terms of bias and point estimate variation. In the
scenario with continuous confounding variables (scenario 2), sMWS resulted in more bias and higher point estimate
variation than aOLR, as can be expected from any stratification based methodology.(10) Although psMWS resulted
in improved results compared to sMWS, performance of aOLR remained superior in this scenario.
To our knowledge, this is the first study directly comparing the performance of confounding adjustment of a
parametric model (OLR) with a non-parametric test (MWS) regarding bias and precision of resulting effect
estimates. Although it is well known that in most cases stratification methods are less effective,(11) we still
compared these methods head-to-head as it reflects the choice that stroke researchers have to make in scientific
practice. Our comparison was primarily focused on quantifying the differences, to provide researchers with more
detailed characteristics of these analyses methods. The MWS seems primarily suited for situations when no
adjustment for confounding is indicated, i.e. in primary analyses of interventional studies. But our simulations
showed that sMWS also performs comparably to aOLR in a range of confounding variable settings. However, with
increasing number of continuous confounding variables (and thus strata), the sMWS becomes more biased and
shows higher point estimate variation, which is corrected for only partly by psMWS.
Our simulations have the limitation that they do not address other issues relevant when deciding which analysis
technique should be applied. These issues include residual confounding, measurement error and misclassification,
model misspecification, and missing data patterns. Although important, we believe these issues are in some sense
secondary to the more basic question that we addressed in our simulations. Another limitation is that we modeled

proportional effects of our confounding variables on the outcome; further research could focus on exploring the
comparative performance of MWS and OLR when violating the proportional odds assumption. A final limitation is
inseparably linked with the nature of the MWS; as it performs proversions between two groups only, it can only be
used when studying a binary exposure variable. This might not be a problem in most intervention studies, but
dichotomization of a non-dichotomous exposure invariably leads to a loss of information. We firmly believe that
the choice on how the exposure is modeled should be based on subject matter knowledge in combination with a
weighing of potential drawbacks of analysis techniques. Therefore, we are not able to provide a general statement
whether the benefits of the assumption free MWS approach outweigh drawbacks that come from the required
categorization of both the exposure and the confounding variables. Other research fields than stroke might have a
different constellation of known confounding factors, which renders it difficult to extrapolate our results to other
fields. Yet, as we provide the used Stata code, readers could modify the provided code in the appendix to generate
results more relevant to their specific setting.
In conclusion, the confounding variable settings in our stroke simulation scenario resulted in an unbiased
performance of both methods, and the higher point estimate variation in the stratified MWS was corrected with
propensity score based stratification. Continuous and ordinal confounding variables strained the performance of
stratified MWS, and this led to unacceptable problems when fitting a large number of strata over a small number of
observations. In future stroke research, the stratified MWS is a valid analysis method only when adjustment is
needed for a limited number of confounding variables, and when sufficient observations are available to prevent
model instability due to empty cells. If it is not possible to keep this ratio of number of strata versus number of
observations relatively low, OLR is the superior analysis method. However, propensity score based stratification
improves the confounding adjustment performance of MWS, and this should be weighed against the specific
limitations of any regression method.

Figure 1. Bias of Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (MWS), ordinal logistic regression (OLR), stratified MannWhitney measure of superiority (sMWS), adjusted ordinal logistic regression (aOLR), and propensity score based
stratified Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (psMWS) in scenario 1. The psMWS was not performed in the
scenario with one confounding variable. Runs (N): 1000.
The x-axis shows the number of confounding variables modeled. The y-axis shows the bias, with estimates from
the OLR analyses converted to a MWS. Boxplots display the lower adjacent value, 25 th percentile, median, 75th
percentile, and upper adjacent value (extreme outliers are not displayed).
