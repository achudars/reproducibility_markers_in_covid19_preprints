Abstract:
Objective:

No diagnostic biomarkers are available for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Magnetic

resonance imaging (MRI) studies have provided evidence for structural abnormalities in distinct brain

regions, but effect sizes are small and have limited clinical relevance. To investigate whether individual

patients can be distinguished from healthy controls, we performed multivariate analysis of structural

neuroimaging

data

from

the

ENIGMA-OCD

consortium.

completely new data from other sites, model performance did not exceed chance-level (AUC—0.51

(SD=0.11;Pcorr>.99) to 0.54 (SD=0.08;Pcorr>.99)). In contrast, good classification performance (>0.8 AUC)

was achieved within subgroups of patients split according to their medication status.

Conclusions:

Parcellated structural MRI data do not enable good distinction between patients with OCD and controls.

However, classifying subgroups of patients based on medication status enables good identification at

the individual subject level. This underlines the need for

longitudinal studies on the short- and long-

term effects of medication on brain structure.

Introduction

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe and disabling condition that occurs in 2-3% of the

population [1]. It is characterized by recurrent, intrusive, irrational and distressing thoughts (obsessions)

and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) [2]. So far, no biomarkers that may aid differential

diagnosis are available, and diagnosis relies entirely on recognition of behavioral features assessed by

clinical interview [3]. Many neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for abnormalities in cortico-

striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits, as well as distributed changes in limbic, parietal and cerebellar

regions [4, 5]. This has recently been confirmed by meta- and mega- analysis of neuroimaging studies

within the Enhancing Neuro-Imaging and Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium [6–8].

However, inference was done at the group-level, and the small effect sizes that were reported precludes

clinical application.

Analytic tools such as multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) enable inference at the individual-

level,

from controls with accuracies ranging from 66-100% (reviewed in [12]). Although these results are

promising, sample sizes have typically been small, limiting model performance optimization and leading

to high variance in estimated accuracy and overly optimistic classification rates [13]. Additionally, most

Here, we used data from the ENIGMA-OCD consortium, including 4,372 participants recruited at

36 research institutes around the world, with a full range of technical and clinical heterogeneity. We

Materials and methods

Study population
The ENIGMA-OCD working group includes 46 data sets from 36 international research institutes, with

neuroimaging and clinical data from adult (≥18 years) and pediatric (<18 years) samples. In total, we

analyzed data from 4,372 participants, including 2,304 OCD patients (n=1,801 adult, n=503 child) and

2,068 healthy controls (HC; i.e., free of psychopathology; n=1,629 adult, n=439 child), with 38 of 46

datasets identical to those described in previous mega-analyses by this working group [6, 7, 17]. All

participating sites obtained permission from their local institutional review boards or ethics committees

to provide anonymized data for analysis, and all study participants provided written informed consent.

used for classification included cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA) and subcortical volumes of ROIs,

two lateral ventricular and intra-cranial volumes (ICV), and two whole-hemisphere measures for SA and

CT.

Multivariate classification and validation
Participants with >10% missing entries were excluded (N=276), and median imputation was used for

missing MRI data on the training set. Continuous features were centered around median zero and scaled

according to their interquartile range. FS variables were combined with covariates age, sex, and site by

concatenating individual feature vectors. All analyses were performed separately for pediatric and adult

patients, and both groups combined. Common MVPA classifiers were applied: support vector machine

(SVM) with linear and non-linear (radial-basis-function (RBF)) kernels, logistic regression (LR) with L1 and

L2 regularization, Gaussian processes classification (GPC) with a linear kernel, and two decision-tree

based ensemble methods, namely the random forest classifier (RFC) and the XGBoost algorithm [24–27].

A deep neural network was also implemented (fully connected; 3 layers with 60, 40 and 20 nodes

respectively).

Clinical variables and sensitivity analysis
To explore the effects of clinical heterogeneity on classification performance, we selected subgroups

with particular demographic and clinical characteristics: medication use, OCD severity, age of onset (AO)

and duration of illness. Classifications performed were HC vs low (YBOCS<=24; mild-moderate[30]) and

high severity (YBOCS>24; moderate-severe) OCD; HC vs early (<18yrs) and late AO (>=18yrs) OCD; HC vs

short (<=7yrs) and long duration (>7yrs) OCD; and HC vs unmedicated and medicated OCD. For disease

Discussion

We

found

that

data

is

unable

to

provide

accurate

distinction between OCD cases and controls. Classification of the complete sample using site-stratified

CV ranged between 0.58 and 0.62 AUC, which is not sufficient for clinical application. Differences in

performance

between

classifiers

were

minimal.

Similar

results

were

for

classifications

performed separately on pediatric or adult samples. When validated on completely new data from other

sites

using

LOSO-CV,

Our

findings

highlight

the

impact of validation schemes on classification performance and suggest poor discrimination between

OCD patients and controls when combining data from multiple sites. In contrast, discrimination between

subgroups of patients based on medication status enabled good individual subject classification.

Few diagnostic classifiers have been applied to OCD across multiple scanners and sites. Prior

studies using structural MRI data to classify OCD using single-site samples yielded accuracies ranging

from 0.72 up to 0.93 (reviewed in [12]). The wide range of performances observed in our individual site

classification is in agreement with the published literature. Such a wide range may in part be explained

by

sample

size,

as

larger

samples

tended

to

have

higher

AUC

values

[14,

28,

32].

However,

this

relationship does not necessarily hold true for large-scale multi-site studies, due to heterogeneity that

arises from pooling samples with different scanning parameters, processing pipelines, inclusion criteria,

demographic and clinical characteristics [12, 33]. All these factors can impact the data and obscure a

pattern of abnormalities shared by all patients. Single-site studies that minimize heterogeneity may

therefore yield higher classification performances, but limit the generalizability to new, unseen data and

its use in clinical practice [14, 15]. LOSO-CV demonstrated that these structural MRI features do not

provide a biomarker that enables generalization to new sites.

mediate neuroplasticity in various cortical and subcortical structures through glio- and neuro-genesis

[34–36]. However, little is known about how these findings might translate to humans and what the

effects of long-term medication use are [37]. A few longitudinal studies suggest that SRI treatment

normalizes brain volumes. One study reported significantly larger thalamic volumes in treatment-naïve

pediatric patients compared to controls and these differences decreased following paroxetine treatment

[38]. Another study reported smaller gray matter volume of CSTC-related regions in treatment-naïve

patients that were no longer detectable following fluoxetine treatment [39]. Nonetheless, it remains

unclear whether these structural changes are related to medication use or to symptom improvement.

Features that enabled multivariate classifications for medicated OCD vs HC included thickness of

and

included

Although these multivariate features are important for the classifications as a whole, this appears

consistent

with

meta-

and

that

also

reported

medication effects [6, 7]. Compared to HC, pediatric OCD patients had larger thalamic volumes and this

finding was specific to unmedicated patients. This finding is in line with the normalizing effects of

paroxetine on thalamic volume described previously. However, most findings have pointed towards

more pronounced brain abnormalities in medicated patients than in unmedicated patients compared to

controls. For example, medicated pediatric patients were found to have smaller cortical surface area

(mainly in frontal regions) that was not detected in unmedicated patients. Medicated adult OCD patients

showed thinner frontal, temporal and parietal cortices, and smaller hippocampal and larger pallidum

volumes, whereas no differences were found for unmedicated adult patients. These results fit with the

finding that the classification performance between medicated vs. unmedicated patients was better

than that between cases versus controls, and may reflect minimization of heterogeneity in stratified

patient groups compared

to

HC.

Although these findings suggest

that

antidepressants

affect

brain

structure that enables good single-subject classification, causal evidence for medication effects warrants

prospective longitudinal studies. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether these findings are specific to

OCD, or whether it is also present in other psychiatric disorders.

A number of limitations deserve emphasis. First, we used a sample pooled from existing data

across the world, without harmonized protocols for scanning, inclusion criteria or demographic and

clinical characteristics. These sources of heterogeneity may limit classification performance, but this also

provides an opportunity for model development using independent data sets and the discovery of

biomarkers that are reproducible across study sites. Second, limited information on medication use was

available.

adjuvant

We were therefore only able to distinguish patients on antidepressants with or without

antipsychotics

versus

those

who

had

not

received

any

medication.

Medication

history,

medication dosage, and duration of use were unknown. Nonetheless, these coarsely defined medication

groups

enabled

better

case-control

discrimination

and

good

classification

of

medicated

versus

unmedicated cases. Third, there is a lack of information on comorbidity and OCD subtype in our dataset.

Particular OCD subtypes may have different neural correlates, and this might limit the ability of MVPA

models to find generalizable patterns in brain structure [12, 40]. Finally, it is possible that the brain

features

used

for

classification

led

to

sub-optimal

performance.

OCD

is

thought

to

derive

from

abnormalities distributed at the network-level rather than focused on a single brain area, and FreeSurfer

features might not be sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle alterations associated with OCD.

Taken together, this study provides a realistic estimate of the classification performance that

can be achieved in a large, ecologically valid, multi-site sample of OCD participants using data on

regional brain structure. Our findings show that parcellated structural MRI data does not enable a good

overall distinction between patients with OCD and healthy controls. However, classifying subgroups of

patients based on medication status enables good identification at the individual subject level. This

underlines the need for longitudinal studies on the short- and long-term effects of medication on brain

structure.
