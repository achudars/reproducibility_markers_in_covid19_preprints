Abstract

Objective: To develop a theoretical framework for assessing knowledge about the
possible outcomes of undergoing cataract surgery, and explore the association of
knowledge level with psychological status and decision quality among patients with
cataract in Southern China.

Methods: The details of the knowledge scale were based on the health education
information booklet provided by National Eye Institute, NIH. We used a theory-based
approach to assess gist knowledge, which comprises conceptual and numeric
questions related to knowledge of the possible surgical outcomes. The scale was then
used in a cross-sectional study to assess the association of knowledge score with
psychological status and decision quality of cataract patients, including worry, anxiety,
attitudes, intentions, decisional conflict, confidence in decision making, anticipated
regret and temporal orientation.

Results: A total of 489 participants with age-related cataract were included in this study,
and 10.2% (50/489) of them had adequate level of knowledge. The knowledge scale
was significantly associated to the levels of worry (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.36, 95%CI:
0.18, 0.70; P = 0.003), anxiety (beta coefficient = -5.36, 95%CI: -8.88,-1.84; P = 0.003),
inaction regret (OR = 0.49, 95%CI : 0.28, 0.88; P = 0.016) and decision conflict (beta
coefficient = -7.93, 95%CI: -12.81, -3.04; P = 0.002) in multivariate analyses adjusted
for age, sex, education level and literacy level.

Conclusion: The level of knowledge adequacy with cataract surgery outcomes is high
in China and was associated with psychological status and decision quality. These
findings suggest that strategies targeting knowledge of possible surgical outcomes
may reduce psychological stress and improve decision quality among patients with
age-related cataract.

1. Introduction
Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment (VI) and blindness.1 Surgical
removal of the clouded lens remains one of the most commonly used procedures
worldwide2 3. Modern cataract surgery (e.g., phacoemulsification) has become a safe
and reliable therapeutic procedure, and there is an increasing number of people with
mild VI or even good vision receiving the surgery for the improvement of their vison
and quality of life4.Therefore, it is essential to assess patients’ knowledge of the
possible outcomes of undergoing or delaying cataract surgery, which might inform the
clinical option that best accommodates their personal preferences and making
informed choices5. Although knowledge is one of the most commonly used outcome
measures in decision aid trials6, none of the currently available tools adequately
captures the level of knowledge and determine the effect of a decision supporting
program on the quality of decision for cataract patients.7-9

Furthermore, little is known about the association between cataract patients’
knowledge; and their psychological status and decision quality. This is a clinically
relevant issue, as mental health problems have become a huge social burden among
the elderly population.10 Recent evidence suggests that cataract-related vision loss has
a great impact on patients’ psychological parameters,11 12 and patients with age-related
cataract show a higher rate of depression and anxiety before surgery13. All these
adverse psychological factors among the elderly may contribute to worse physical
health status, and even high suicide risk.14 Given that knowledge is a potentially

modifiable factor, improving cataract knowledge for elderly people may have broad
strategic implications for alleviating their mental health problems before surgery.

Finally, with the increasing demand for shared decision-making in clinical guidelines,
there is a great emphasis on increasing patients’ knowledge which can lead to
improved decision quality.15 16 A systematic review containing over 100 randomized
controlled trials worldwide suggested that patient decision aids increase knowledge
and accurate risk perceptions; and reduce decisional conflict and indecision about
personal values, but it has divergent results on decision confidence and anticipated
regret.8 Considering the data vary on the patients’ knowledge and their decision quality
in different countries, it is necessary to investigate this potential link among cataract
patients.

The primary purpose of the current study was to develop a theoretical framework for
assessing the magnitude of knowledge associated with cataract surgery decision in
China. In addition, we explored the potential association of patients’ knowledge with
their psychological status (including cataract worry and anxiety), attitudes and
intentions towards surgery and decision quality (including anticipated regret, decisional
conflict, confidence in decision making and temporal orientation).

2.1 Development and design of a knowledge scale for decisions about the timing
of cataract surgery
We determined the content of the knowledge scale using an expert-led approach
based on the health education information booklet provided by National Eye Institute,
NIH.17
The health information booklet mentions that:
“A cataract needs to be removed only when vision loss interferes with your everyday
activities, such as driving, reading, or watching TV. You and your eye care professional
can make this decision together. Once you understand the benefits and risks of surgery,
you can make an informed decision about whether cataract surgery is right for you. In
most cases, delaying cataract surgery will not cause long-term damage to your eye or
make the surgery more difficult. You do not have to rush into surgery.”17

These statements highlight two important information relevant to surgical decision that
should be revealed to patients: the benefits and risks of surgery. We therefore
developed key knowledge items based on Fuzzy Trace Theory18 19 , which proposes
two ways in which people process information: (1) processing and remembering the
underlying meaning (“gist”) and (2) processing and remembering precise details
(“verbatim”). We argued that when people are making decisions, gist information plays
a more important role than verbatim information, because the former relies less on
accurate details. We therefore proposed 10 knowledge items to reflect whether
patients understood the gist of the information on conceptual knowledge of the

definition of cataract, as well as the possible impacts of undergoing or delaying cataract
surgery. Since numeracy may contribute to poor understanding of health information
and influence the extent of medical decision making20, we also included two numeric
questions to assess the potential number of people affected by undergoing or delaying
cataract surgery (Table 1).

Marks for all questions were summed to give a maximum total score of 14 (Table 2).
We proposed an a priori definition of “adequate knowledge” when responders scored
at least 50% of available marks on subscale 1; and 40% on subscales 2 and 3,
including at least one numerical mark.

2.2 Implementing the knowledge scale in a community-based eye disease
screening setting
We next applied the knowledge scale in a community-based and cross-sectional study
conducted at Yuexiu district of Guangzhou, China, between June 12 and July 23 in
2019. We recruited participants via telephone survey in Huanghuagang Block,21 a
socio-economically representative area in urban Southern China. The study adhered
to the Declaration of Helsinki and approvals were obtained from the Zhongshan
Ophthalmic Center Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was
obtained from the participants.

2.2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All persons aged 50 to 80 years, presenting to the eye disease screening site were
eligible for study participation if they had been definitely diagnosed with an age-related
cataract but not received previous cataract surgery, and they were willing to participate
in this study and provide written informed consent. We excluded subjects if they were
bilaterally blind (presenting distance visual acuity worse than 3/60), suffered from
ocular comorbidities which could not be cured by cataract surgery alone, had
contraindications of cataract surgery, or had self -reported mental disorders or hearing
impairment that affect face-to-face communication with interviewers.

2.2.2 Data collection
We used a detailed interviewer-administered questionnaire to collect participants’
information on demographics, knowledge about cataract and other variables, including
cataract worry and anxiety, attitudes towards cataract surgery22, intentions23,
decisional conflict, confidence in decision making, anticipated regret (action regret and
inaction regret) and temporal orientation9 24.

All participants involved in our study were required to complete the questionnaires
under the guidance of trained interviewers from an independent non-profit company.
To enhance the reliability of the answers provided in this survey, our interviewers, who
have been trained to make personal connections with elderly peoples and answer their
questions any time, explained the questions aloud one by one to make sure the
information provided was well-understood by every subject, including those with low

level of literacy and education.

2.2.3 Knowledge assessment
Knowledge was assessed as a dichotomous outcome based on the marking scheme
(Table 2).

2.2.4 Assessment of psychological status and decision quality
Psychological status
Patients’ anxiety was measured with the six-item Spielberger State Trait Anxiety
Inventory (STAI),25 26 one of the most commonly used measures of anxiety in research
and clinics. The version used here was translated into Chinese and its validity has
been demonstrated in many studies.27All items were rated on a 4-point scale ranging
from “almost never” to “almost always” (scored 1-4). A total score ranged from 4 to 24
with higher scores indicating greater anxiety28. Furthermore, participants were asked
how worried they were of vision impairment due to cataract; they responded on a 4point Likert scale anchored from “not worried at all” to “very worried” (scored 1 to 4
respectively).9 29.

Attitudes and intentions
We measured patients’ attitudes towards cataract surgery with a validated, theorybased generic attitudes scale comprising six items with five response categories
(ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”), forming a scale from six to 3024.
As reported previously, we set the threshold for a positive attitude at 249 24. Patients

indicated their intentions about receiving cataract surgery as soon as possible via a
single item with five responses ranging from “definitely will not” to “definitely will”
(scored 1-5)9

24

. In our survey, we classified “definitely will” and “likely to” receive

surgical treatment as positive intentions.

Decisional conflict
We used a scale adapted from the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) to measure
patients’ overall decisional conflict, the particular factors causing uncertainty (e.g.
feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values and unsupported in decision making)
and perceived effective decision making (16 items, 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4).30
The reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the DCS were demonstrated
previously.31

Decision confidence
We used the Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES) to assess patients’ confidence in
obtaining adequate information during decision making process. The scale for patients
has demonstrated good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s α of 0.84.32.
Participants were asked how confident they felt when making an informed choice on a
20-item scale with 5 response categories ranging from “not at all confident” to “very
confident” (scored 1-5). The total scores ranged from 0 to 100, and higher scores
indicated greater self-efficacy9.

All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Anticipated regret
We used two items adapted from the scale in previous studies to assess participants’
anticipated regret about receiving cataract surgery (action regret) and about delaying
cataract surgery (inaction regret), with five response categories ranging from “strongly
disagree” to “strongly agree” (scored 1-5)9 33. In this study, we assessed the level of
inaction regret and action regret as “no” (1-2 scores), “unsure” (3 scores) and “yes” (45 scores).

Temporal orientation
Temporal orientation, defined by the tendency to emphasize psychological past,
present and future, affects patients’ emotion and decision making process.34 We used
the four-item short form of the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale to
measure this variable of participants35, with five response categories ranging from
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” (scored 1 - 5). The total scores ranged from 5 to
25, with higher scores indicating a long-term temporal orientation (i.e., greater
orientation towards the future)9 36.

2.3 Statistical analyses
Data analyses were performed using Stata version 12.0. The associations between
adequate knowledge and other demographic variables (age, sex, education level,
literacy, BCVA and insurance type) were examined using Chi-square or Fisher's exact
tests. A potential multicollinearity between education level and literacy was assessed

using variance inflation factor (VIF), which is less than 1.5 in the regression analysis.
For categorical variables, we developed univariate logistic regression to calculate the
odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the associations between
knowledge level and other factors (e.g., attitudes, intentions, worry and anticipated
regret) adjusted for age, sex, education level and literacy. For continuous variables,
we developed simple linear regression to examine the associations between patients’
knowledge level and other factors (e.g., anxiety, decision conflict, decision confidence
and temporal orientation). All P-values were 2-sided and considered statistically
significant if less than 0.05.

Results

A total of 489 subjects participated in our study. The mean (± standard Deviation) age
of our participants was 64.06±5.46 years (Table 3). Most participants were aged 60~70
years (65.24%), female (70.14%), had higher school certificate or above (71.99%),
semiliterate or literate (92.23%), had the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the
worse-seeing eye greater than logMAR 20/40 (89.78%), and had public medical
insurance (98.98%). There were no significant differences for the participants’
sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, education level, literacy, BCVA,
and insurance between participants who had adequate and inadequate knowledge (all
with P > 0.05). Overall, 439 (89.78%) of our study participants had inadequate
knowledge about cataract surgery and 50 (10.22%) had adequate knowledge.

In Tables 4 - 6, each value represents the result of a separate regression model, with
attitudes, intentions, cataract worry, anxiety, anticipated regret, decisional conflict,
confidence and temporal orientation as the dependent variable, and age, sex,
education level and literacy level as co-variates in the multivariate regression models.
There was no statistically significant interaction between education level and literacy
when we included both of them in the same multivariate model (P > 0.05, data not
shown).

Table 4 shows the correlations of knowledge with attitudes and intentions of treatment
options. Adequate level of knowledge was found to correlate with negative attitudes (P
< 0.001) and the intention to delay cataract surgery (P = 0.008). The associations of
knowledge with cataract worry and anxiety are shown in Table 5. In our study, we found
that participants with adequate level of knowledge were less likely to have cataract
worry and anxiety (P = 0.003 for both). In terms of decision quality shown in Table 6,
adequate level of knowledge was negatively associated with decision conflict (P =
0.002) and inaction regret (P = 0.016). Other factors about decision quality including
action regret, decision confidence and temporal orientation were not associated with
patients’ knowledge (all with P > 0.05).

Discussion

This study describes the development of a knowledge scale for measuring the benefits
and risks of undergoing or delaying cataract surgery. The measure consisted of three

core knowledge items considered indispensable for making an informed choice about
cataract surgery. Our study provided evidence that the knowledge scale was
responsive for assessing gist knowledge of cataract surgery. In addition, we suggested
that cataract patients with adequate knowledge were more likely to possess greater
psychological conditions and decisional quality, although they tended to be more
negative and delay surgical treatment.

Our knowledge scale was an objective measurement developed under the guidance
of experts using a number of conceptual and numeric questions rather than a
subjective, self-reported assessment of knowledge, because the latter might result in
many false positives.37 Given that public awareness of the benefits and risks of cataract
surgery is limited, we adopted the expert-led approach in the current study. However,
it contrasts with other studies that both patients and professionals were involved in the
establishment of the scale, which, to some extent, could address patients’ concerns
and minimize their misunderstanding of the sentences.38 39 To address these questions,
we chose not to use the confusing or difficult words in the questionnaire and referred
to content domains for knowledge measurement in previous study.38 Furthermore, we
set a cut-off for adequate knowledge (i.e. 50% or above) using a competency-based
method,38 40 enabling us to assess knowledge based on pre-determined standards
rather than participants’ ranking or mean score.

In our study, adequate level of knowledge was negatively associated with cataract
worry and anxiety (P = 0.003 for both), suggesting that inadequate knowledge might
be a risk factor of worry and anxiety. It is consistent with the previous study that the
decision aid group had not only increased knowledge scores but alleviated anxiety for
women considering birth options41. However, Stacey’s review showed that in many
studies, there were no differences in anxiety and worry between the decision aid and
control groups,8 implying that the increase of knowledge using decision support
program would not cause undue anxiety and worry to participants.

In addition, adequate level of knowledge was closely correlated with negative attitude
(P < 0.001) and intentions to delay cataract surgery (P = 0.008). It seems that this may
result from increasing patients’ knowledge about the complications and risks of
cataract surgery. In terms of decision quality, adequate knowledge was found
negatively associated to decision conflict and inaction regret, implying that patients
with increased knowledge might experience greater certainty about their options and
feel more supported. It was consistent with previous studies in India42, Australia43 and
the United Kingdom41 that knowledge improvement by decision aids helped in reducing
decision conflict and uncertainty. However, there was not statistically significant in
decision conflict and regret in Brazell’s study for the treatment of pelvic organ
prolapse.44 As contradictory results of decision quality were observed including
decision conflict, satisfaction, risk perception, confidence and regret in multiple

decision-aid trials,8 further studies are needed to test out the reasons for heterogeneity
of findings.

The strengths of our study lie in the detailed method about how knowledge was
measured, and that was found to be responsive to psychological conditions and
decision quality among cataract patients in Guangzhou. Furthermore, we used a series
of validated, widely used scales to examine patients’ psychological status and their
decision quality, making the results of our study more reliable.

Our study also had several limitations. First, the current study focused on people living
in urban area of Guangzhou, who probably had a higher education level, greater health
awareness and were more actively participated in healthcare decisions. Meanwhile,
the study sample may have been biased by not recruiting those who were most fearful
of surgery, less socially connected or had a problem paying for medications. As a result,
the subjects included in our study may not be representative of the general population
of cataract patients. Second, as cataract patients did not involve in the establishment
of the knowledge scale, we may have ignored some of their demands and concerns.
The third limitation of this study is its lack of intervention and follow-up investigation,
so we cannot discover the cause and effect between knowledge and those factors.
Further longitudinal clinical trials are needed to explore the causality and the long-term
effect of decision aids on patients’ psychology and decision quality.

Knowledge level about cataract surgery is important particularly in light of new
techniques such as patient decision aids to promote shared decision making. Despite
this, there is limited research on how best to measure knowledge in community-based
eye care screening settings. Our knowledge scale was found to be acceptable to
patients with age-related cataract and responsive to a range of psychometric
measurements and decision quality. Further work is needed to evaluate the validity of
this knowledge scale in the context of the Chinese eye care system.
