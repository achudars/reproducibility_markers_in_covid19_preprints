Abstract
Objectives: Weight loss is common in the years before an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis,
likely due to changes in appetite and diet. The age at which this change in body mass index
(BMI) emerges is unclear but may point to the earliest manifestations of AD, timing that may be
important for identifying windows of intervention or risk reduction. We examined the
association between AD genetic risk and cross-sectional BMI across adults in mid- to late-life as
an innovative approach to determine the age at which BMI changes and may indicate preclinical
AD.
Design: Observational study
Setting: UK Biobank
Participants: 407,386 UK Biobank non-demented participants aged 39-70 with Caucasian
genetic ancestry enrolled 2007-2010.
Main Outcome Measures: BMI (kg/m2) was constructed from height and weight measured
during the initial visit. A genetic risk score for AD (AD-GRS) was calculated as a weighted sum
of 23 genetic variants previously confirmed to be genome-wide significant predictors of AD (Zscored). We evaluated whether the association of AD-GRS with BMI differed by age using
linear regression with adjustment for sex and genetic ancestry, stratified by age grouping (40-60,
61+). We calculated the earliest age at which high AD-GRS predicted divergence in BMI
compared to normal age-related BMI trends with linear and quadratic terms for age and
interactions with AD-GRS.
Results: In 39-49 year olds, AD-GRS was not significantly associated with lower BMI (0.00
kg/m2 per SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI: -0.03,0.03). In 50-59 year olds AD-GRS was associated with
lower BMI (-0.03 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI:-0.06,-0.01) and this association was

stronger in 60-70 year olds (-0.09 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI:-0.12,-0.07). Model-based
BMI age-curves for people with high versus low AD-GRS scores began to diverge after age 47.
Interpretation: Genetic factors that increase AD risk begin to predict lower BMI in adults by
age 50, with greater effect later in older ages. Weight loss may manifest as an early
pathophysiologic change associated with AD.

INTRODUCTION
Given the long, insidious development of dementia and the subtle nature of early cognitive
changes, it remains unclear at what age the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
emerge. Growing evidence of brain changes occurring decades prior to dementia diagnosis may
help explain the failure of recent AD clinical trials, which enroll older adults with cognitive
impairment.1–3 Identifying when the earliest indicators of AD occur would help to identify timing
targets for when preventive interventions may be more effective. Weight loss may be an early
indicator of incipient AD.4–7 Neurodegenerative changes,8,9 changes in metabolism, appetite, and
nutrition10 or other metabolic factors may impact Body Mass Index (BMI) prior to clinical
dementia onset. The age at which weight loss emerges in patients who continue on to develop
AD is unclear but may point to the earliest manifestations of AD.

Identifying the earliest age of weight loss is challenging because higher midlife BMI may
increase the risk of AD.11–14 Thus, the earliest weight loss resulting from developing AD may not
be detectable when comparing earlier BMI values of people subsequently diagnosed with AD.
To evaluate the age when AD-related weight loss begins, we adopt an approach using the genetic
risk of AD. Genetic risk is determined at conception, prior to disease onset, but identifies
individuals who are at high risk of developing AD in the future.15,16 Thus, any association
between AD-related genetic variants and BMI cannot be attributed to the influence of BMI on
AD, but instead would suggest that a biological process associated with the AD-GRS modifies
BMI, assuming there is no pleiotropy of genetic risk for AD and BMI.17

The objective of the current study was to take advantage of known genetic variation in late-onset
AD risk15 to identify the earliest age at which genetic risk for AD was associated with lower
BMI (as a proxy for weight loss). Our approach parallels the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer
Network (DIAN) study, which assessed BMI in “preclinical AD” by comparing the point at
which BMI curves began to diverge between autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers and noncarriers. In DIAN, mutation carriers had significantly lower BMI than non-carriers 11.2 years
prior to expected symptom onset, and BMI curves began to diverge 17.8 years before expected
symptom onset.7 The DIAN study focuses on early-onset AD due to specific genetic mutations,
but the majority of AD cases are late-onset or sporadic AD which differs in etiology. To our
knowledge, no prior study has used this approach to examine BMI trajectories associated with
risk of late-onset AD. In this study, we evaluated the association between late-onset AD genetic
risk and BMI across mid to late-life in UK Biobank.

METHODS
Study Setting and Participants
UK Biobank is an ongoing study of over 500,000 adults. Participants aged 40-69 years old were
recruited 2006-2010 from across the UK to provide detailed information about themselves via
computerized questionnaires, provide biologic samples, undergo clinical measurements, and
have their health followed prospectively.18 In this current analyses, we excluded those with
missing genetic information (n=15,221) or who were flagged as recommended for genetic
analysis exclusion (n=378), and those with missing BMI (n=1,295). We also excluded
participants classified as of non-European genetic ancestry (n=78,336) based on genetic ancestry
principal components, because genetic predictors of AD may differ by ancestry/population

stratification.19 After exclusions, 407,386 participants were included in the analytic sample.
Ethical approval for UK Biobank was obtained from the National Health Service National
Research Ethics Service and all participants provided written informed consent.

Patient and Public Involvement
Patients were not involved in setting the research question, study design, data analysis or
interpretation of the results.

Genotyping and Genetic Risk Scores for AD
Genotyping of UK Biobank samples was conducted with two closely related arrays (Affymetrix
using a bespoke BiLEVE Axiom array and Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array) and is
described in detail elsewhere.20,21 Briefly, all genetic data were quality controlled and imputed by
UK Biobank [downloaded on 12/1/2017] to a reference panel that merged the 1,000 Genomes
Phase 3 and UK10K reference panels. A secondary imputation was completed using the
Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) reference panel and results from the HRC imputation
were preferentially used at SNPs present in both panels. Before the release of the UK Biobank
genetic data a stringent QC protocol (described elsewhere) was applied at the Welcome Trust
Centre for Human Genetics.22

To construct the AD-GRS in UK Biobank, we used summary results from the 2013 International
Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP) meta-analyzed genome-wide association study
(GWAS) on late-onset AD in Caucasian populations15 to calculate an AD genetic risk score
(GRS) for each participant. The IGAP study identified 23 loci associated with AD, including two

SNPs used to characterize APOE ε4 allele status. The GRS was based on the meta-analyzed β
coefficients obtained in the IGAP’s stage 1 study, which included genotyped and imputed data
(7,055,881 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1000G phase 1 alpha imputation, Build 37,
Assembly Hg19) of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls. We calculated the
GRS by multiplying each individual's risk allele count for each locus by the β coefficient
(expressed as the log OR) for that polymorphism (Table 1) and adding the products for all 23
loci. This step weights each SNP in proportion to the observed association with AD risk (either
positive or negative). The scores can be interpreted as the log OR for AD conferred by that
individual’s profile on the 23 SNPs compared to a person who had the major allele at each locus.
We converted the AD-GRS into a standardized z-score based on the sample mean and variance.
This score has previously been shown to predict cognition and dementia-related death in the UK
Biobank.16

Body Mass Index
BMI was calculated based on height and weight (kg/m2) measured at the baseline assessment.

Other Characteristics
Age, sex, and education were reported at baseline assessment. UK Biobank provides principal
components (PCs) related to genetic population stratification, we used the first 10 PCs in our
analyses to adjust for population stratification. Participants underwent a touchscreen-based
cognitive battery, we focused on reaction time (i.e. simple processing speed) as a measure of
cognition as it was available on the largest number of participants. Participants were timed at
pressing a button as soon as two identical cards are seen on the touchscreen.

Statistical Analysis
In preliminary analyses, we conducted analyses stratified by age at assessment (39-49 years, 5059, and 60-73 years old). First, we evaluated the association between BMI and reaction time to
confirm expected associations seen in prior research (e.g. a positive association between BMI
and cognition in mid-life and a negative association between BMI and cognition in late-life). We
used linear regression with reaction time as the outcome and BMI as the primary predictors with
adjustment for age, age2, sex, and education. Next, as our primary analysis, we estimated
separate age-stratified linear regressions with the AD-GRS as the primary predictor and BMI as
the outcome. Models included adjustment for age, age2, sex, and PCs. Finally, we estimated nonlinear trends for age using one linear regression model for the whole sample with AD-GRS, age,
and age2 as primary predictors. We tested whether age trends differed by AD-GRS using
interaction terms between the linear and quadratic age terms and AD-GRS. Based on this
regression equation we calculated the age at which curves began to diverge. To illustrate the
effects of low and high AD genetic risk we calculated predicted BMI curves based on the 10th
percentile (low risk) and 90th percentile (high risk) of the AD-GRS. Based on these same
percentiles we also estimated the earliest age at which high AD-GRS was associated with a
significantly lower BMI compared to low AD-GRS. All regression models included adjustment
for sex and PCs as described above. Analyses were conducted in R (version 3.3.2). All tests were
two-sided with α = 0.05 and we report 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS
Participant baseline characteristics are shown in Table 2; 22% of the sample was aged 39-49;
32.9% aged 50-59 years, and 45.3% of the sample was 60-73 years at time of baseline
assessment and 54.1% were female. The majority of participants had BMI in the normal (33%)
or overweight (43%) range.

Age-stratified results for the association between BMI and cognition (reaction speed) are shown
in Table 2. The association between BMI and cognition (reaction speed) differed by age (Table
3). For ages 39-49 years a higher BMI was associated with worse reaction time (0.13 ms slower
reaction time; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.26; p=0.03). In ages 50-59 a higher BMI was associated with
faster reaction time: (0.12 ms faster reaction time for ages 50-59 (95%CI: 0.23, 0.0002; p=0.045)
and this effect was even stronger for ages 60-73 (0.20 ms faster reaction time 95% CI: 0.32, 0.08;
p=0.001).

Age-stratified results for the association between BMI and the AD-GRS are shown in Table 3. In
39-49 year olds, AD-GRS was not significantly associated with BMI (0.00 kg/m2 per SD in ADGRS; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.03; p=0.94). In 50-59 year olds AD-GRS was associated with lower BMI
(-0.03 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95% CI: -0.06, -0.01; p=0.01) and this association was
stronger and significant in 60-70 year olds ( -0.09 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95% CI:-0.12, 0.07; p<0.001).

Model-based BMI age curves showed an increasing trajectory of average BMI for individuals
aged 40-50, which slowed and finally reversed so that by age 65 each additional year of age was

associated with lower BMI (Figure 1). For participants with the average AD-GRS, age was
associated with increased BMI (0.92 points per decade 95% CI: 0.85, 1.00) but for each decade
after 40 this estimate decreased (age2 term) by -0.21 (95% CI: -0.06, -0.01) points. This slowing
of the age-related BMI curve occurred earlier in people with high AD-GRS scores (p<0.001 for
overall age by AG-GRS interactions). 1 SD AD-GRS was associated with an additional slowing
of the BMI curve of -0.02 (95% CI: -0.04, 0.00) points per decade. The BMI of individuals with
high versus low AD-GRS scores began to diverge after age 47 and the curves further diverged in
after age 65 (Figure 1). Comparing those in the 10th to 90th percentile of AD-GRS, the BMI
statistically significant lower BMI after age 56.

DISCUSSION
We found evidence that higher AD-GRS predicts lower BMI in older adults. We found that the
age at which BMI curves begin to diverge is in mid-life (age 47, with a statistically detectable
difference by late 50s). Age-stratified analyses mirrored this finding. Likewise, a higher BMI
was associated with worse cognition in mid-life and then flipped to the inverse in older ages.
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced BMI or weight loss is an early
manifestation of the AD process that can begin over 20 years prior to disease diagnosis.

Evidence for BMI as an early manifestation of AD
This study expands upon prior work showing that weight loss is a predictor of subsequent AD
diagnosis4–6,12,23 and AD neuropathologic burden.24 The majority of prior studies have been
based on observational data in which it is not possible to establish temporal ordering of BMI
relative to established markers of preclinical AD. A number of studies examining BMI in mid to

late life give conflicting estimates of the age at which lower BMI is associated with AD, ranging
from 20 to 8 years prior to AD diagnosis.13,25,26 Novel approaches can help triangulate evidence
around the timing of BMI change in preclinical AD.27 By examining genetic risk, which is
determined at birth, we provide evidence that some biological process associated with AD
genetic risk affects BMI as early as age 50. Using a similar approach to our study, the
Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study assessed BMI in “preclinical AD” by
comparing the point at which BMI curves began to diverge between autosomal dominant AD
mutation carriers and non-carriers. They found that BMI curves for mutation carriers diverged
from non-carriers as early as 17.8 years prior to expected symptom onset.7 Given that the
average age of AD diagnosis is in the 70s we find a similarly long period (~20 years) in which
BMI may diverge between high and low AD genetic risk. Together these studies suggest
processes related to AD begin many decades prior to diagnosis. We may need to target
interventions in mid-life or earlier to effectively prevent AD or modify the earliest events in the
AD pathologic cascade.

Our findings support the interpretation that pathophysiologic processes that culminate in AD
diagnosis lead to weight loss decades earlier.28 Weight loss in AD may be caused by several
factors, but the exact cause is unknown. Nutritional habits are worse in individuals with mild
cognitive impairment or dementia;10 however UK Biobank participants do not have dementia and
divergence in BMI curves begins years prior to symptom onset. There is also evidence that
neurodegeneration and neuropathologic changes in AD are associated with lower BMI and
weight loss.9,24 Brain regions and pathways important for metabolism, appetite, and weight
maintenance such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are affected in AD and may become

disrupted early in the disease process.8,29 Our results are consistent with BMI as an early marker
for changes due to AD, however, it may also be the case that pleiotropy leads to population
associations between weight loss and the likelihood of AD. Although we cannot conclusively say
these BMI changes are an early manifestation of AD, our findings complement prior
observational studies. Additionally, even if pleiotropic pathways link the AD-GRS to weight
loss, our findings confirm that lower BMI as early as midlife can predict AD and cognitive
decline.

Limitations and study strengths
There are several important caveats and limitations to our analysis. Our measurement of BMI is
cross-sectional; future studies with longitudinal BMI measurements will be needed to verify age
at which weight loss can begin to occur in preclinical AD. Our results are potentially influenced
by selection bias due to selective survival as the AD-GRS is associated with mortality.16
However, this effect is likely limited because the sample is relatively young and healthy with a
low mortality rate, especially due to dementia.16 Genetic risk for AD only explains a small
percentage of variation in cognitive impairment and AD diagnosis, thus there is substantial
variation in risk for AD that is not captured by our risk score. This variation reduces the ability to
detect associations. These analyses were conducted in participants of European ancestry and
were generally healthy and well educated; this may limit generalizability. However, there are
considerable strengths to this study, particularly the large sample size, the use of measured BMI,
and an innovative analytic approach. By using genetic risk, we circumvent a central challenge in
interpreting prior results on weight loss, BMI and AD.

Conclusion
Genetic factors that increase sporadic AD risk begin to predict lower BMI as early as age 47,
many years prior to the average age of AD diagnosis (mid-70s). Weight loss may manifest as an
early pathophysiologic change associated with AD. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to
confirm the earliest detectable physiologic changes resulting from AD.

What is already known on this topic
-

Weight loss is common among Alzheimer’s disease patients in the years prior to
diagnosis.

-

The ages at which this association begins to manifest is unknown but has implications for
prevention and treatment of dementia.

What this study adds
-

Genetic factors that increase sporadic AD risk predict lower BMI over a decade prior to
the average age of AD diagnosis (mid-70s) and predicted BMI curves for low and high
AD-GRS begin to diverge as early as age 47.

-

These data suggest weight loss may manifest as a very early pathophysiologic change
associated with AD.

-

This early divergence in BMI may suggest we need to target interventions in mid-life or
earlier to effectively prevent or modify the earliest events in the AD pathologic cascade.
