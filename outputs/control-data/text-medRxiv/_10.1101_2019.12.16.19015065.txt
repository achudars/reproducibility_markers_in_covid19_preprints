ABSTRACT
The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) is a
programme of infrastructure development across NIHR Biomedical Research Centres
(BRCs) in the UK. The aim of the NIHR HIC is to improve the quality and availability of
routinely collected clinical data for collaborative, cross-centre research. This is demonstrated
through research collaborations in selected therapeutic areas, one of which is viral hepatitis.
The collaboration in viral hepatitis identified a rich set of data fields, including information on
clinical assessment, antiviral treatment, laboratory test results, and health outcomes. Clinical
data from different centres were standardised and combined to produce a research-ready
dataset; this was used to generate insights regarding disease prevalence and treatment
response.
A comprehensive database and governance framework has been developed for potential
viral hepatitis research interests, with a corresponding data dictionary for researchers across
the centres. Data for an initial cohort of 960 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infections and 1404 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections has been
collected.
For the first time, large prospective cohorts are being formed within NHS secondary care
services that will allow research questions to be rapidly addressed using real world data.
Interactions with industry partners will help to shape future research and will inform patientstratified clinical practice. An emphasis on NHS-wide systems interoperability, and the
increased utilisation of structured and unstructured data solutions for electronic patient
records, is improving access to data for research, service improvement and the reduction of
clinical data gaps.

INTRODUCTION
The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) [1]
was established in response to a challenge by the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officer
Dame Sally Davis to make routinely-collected clinical data available for translational
research across multiple sites. The NIHR HIC is a programme of infrastructure development
across the network of 23 National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, supported by their university
partners through the NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs). The programme was
initially made up of five NHS Trusts hosting comprehensive NIHR BRCs; Cambridge
University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH), Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation
Trust (GSTT), Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHT), Oxford University Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust (OUH), and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust (UCLH). The aim of the NIHR HIC programme is to improve the quality and availability
of routinely collected clinical data, making it available for cross-centre collaborative,
translational research. This presents both opportunities and challenges:

Opportunities:
•

The United Kingdom’s unified healthcare system (the NHS) generates millions of
clinical datapoints each year, which can be leveraged to improve collection of clinical
information, address clinical research questions and improve patient care.

•

The automated collection of data from Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems can
dramatically reduce the time and cost of data collection for research and provide
opportunities for collaboration with both academic and industry partners.

•

Modern machine learning techniques using neural networks require large datasets to
be used effectively [2], the re-use of routinely collected data can provide a cost
effective way of collating these datasets.

Challenges:
•

All NHS trusts are separate organisations, responsible for the protection of the data
of their own patients. To enable data to be shared across these separate
organisations for research, a governance framework needed to be established.

•

Each NHS trust has its own EPR, and its own set of customisations, extensions, and
variations in data entry practice. Alongside the primary EPR, each trust will also have
an extensive collection of departmental systems, again subject to customisation and
variations in practice.

•

Data definitions are not all standardised.

•

Not all data are collected electronically at all sites.

•

Large amounts of important data are stored in free text rather than discrete values.

•

Clinical practice can differ between sites.

•

Data can be produced and collected differently between sites. (e.g., different
laboratory methods or platforms used for tests)

•

Different trusts have different levels of expertise in clinical informatics.

•

Projects like the NIHR HIC require sustained investment before they start to deliver
tangible results.

The NIHR HIC aims to overcome these challenges and demonstrate the value of these data
for research in key therapeutic areas; the first five areas considered were viral hepatitis,
ovarian cancer, critical care, acute coronary syndromes, and renal transplantation. This
paper focuses on the viral hepatitis theme, which is led by OUH.

Viral hepatitis is a global health problem with an estimated 1.35 million people dying from
either end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma or other viral hepatitis related
diseases in 2015 [3]. The majority of these deaths are as a result of Hepatitis B and C virus
infection; this is greater than tuberculosis, HIV or malaria. Unlike these other infections, the n

number of viral hepatitis deaths has increased since 1990 [4]. International targets arising
from the United Nations “sustainable development goals” have set a challenge for the
elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by the year 2030 [5,6]. As part of
meeting this goal, leveraging existing clinical data is a cost-effective way to answer vital
research questions. The NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis theme aims to address key research
questions (Table 1), to demonstrate the utility of the NIHR HIC methodology.

National Institute of Health Research Health Informatics Collaborative viral hepatitis
theme dataset.

This paper presents a comprehensive methodology that has been proposed, implemented
and validated by the NIHR HIC for the development of a new data collection and
management pipeline. This development is under a comprehensive governance framework
that allows data to be collated across multiple centres for collaborative research on viral
hepatitis. Under this governance framework, a data collaboration involves the generation of
a research-ready dataset that is broad enough to support a wide range of investigations in a
specific clinical area. The dataset is assembled to the same agreed standards at each
centre. The data transformations needed to achieve this, starting from patient records, are
documented and shared.

METHODOLOGY
Governance Framework
The protocol for the collection and management of the data for the viral hepatitis theme has
been reviewed and approved by South Central - Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (REF
Number: 15/SC/0523). In addition, a NIHR HIC data sharing framework, covering a wide
range of data and research collaborations has been signed by all participating centres. This
document, in conjunction with the rest of the governance framework established by the
NIHR HIC, addresses common requirements and considerations regarding data sharing
between centres, contractual responsibilities, confidentiality, intellectual property, and a
publications policy. This general agreement will be used to underpin individual agreements
for research collaborations with third party academic and industry partners. Any
collaboration with industry partners requires additional agreements, with additional
governance checks by participating sites. This process has been simplified by the creation of
a ‘framework industry collaboration agreement’ which simplifies the addition of individual
participating sites to an industry collaboration. A scientific steering committee has been
established which is made up of a representative of each participating site, and reviews and
approves data requests from external collaborators.

Development of Data Model
The development of the NIHR HIC viral hepatitis data model, which outlines the structure of
the dataset and the associations between the data fields, began by the clinical leads defining
data fields, required to answer the initial academic questions posed by the clinical and
scientific leads across centres (Table 1). The feasibility of collecting this dataset was tested
using the electronic data capture software OpenClinica [7]. Each site was required to
manually complete case report forms in OpenClinica for a small subset of their patient
cohorts; an assessment of the completeness of these data led to a refinement of the dataset
and a second version, which was used to generate the Extensible Markup Language (XML)

Schema Definition (XSD) used to define the dataset. This XSD was then further refined to
remove errors and to provide a more efficient data structure.

Data Architecture for Collection and Integration of Data
Each site within the collaboration provided a data product containing the data items outlined
in the agreed dataset. Whilst each site had pre-existing data warehouses and systems for
collecting, storing, and using patient data, these systems were designed to be used for
patient care, administrative, and financial purposes, and were not always suitable for
generating the required data product. The variety of EPR systems and LIMS used across the
participating sites meant that data were often stored in different formats. This meant that at
each site a data architecture outlying the flow of data from EPR systems had to be
developed to allow the effective flow of data from operational systems to research systems.
This required the development of data warehousing or data management infrastructure at all
sites.

To allow the compilation of the full dataset, each site generated a data product that was
integrated in the NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis Central Data Repository (Figure 1). In some
cases, these data were already structured and could be transferred directly into the data
repository. Where data were stored in an unstructured (free text) format, the data had to be
either manually entered or extracted (Figure 2). The data was then anonymised by
removing patient identifiers and a data product was created using the XML format. This was
securely transferred to the NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis Central Data Repository, where the data
were put into a database for queries and analysis. When a dataset is requested by a
research group, the request is first reviewed and approved by the scientific steering
committee, and following internal governances process, an extract of the integrated dataset
is provided to the research group for their analysis.

NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis Central Data Repository
Anonymised data from the providing centres was transmitted to the lead centre in XML
format via secure e-mail or submitted directly to the NIHR HIC Data Acquisition
Management (HICDAM) system via a secure web-based front end, again in XML format.
The primary service inside HICDAM is the Message Receiving, Curating, and Understanding
Repository (MeRCURy), which performs the validation, processing, and storing of the
submitted data.

The MeRCURy system supports two types of data validation: basic, automatic integrity
checks, which must be satisfied before the data are loaded into the database, and more
sophisticated, manual checks of data consistency, which are performed after the data have
been loaded. The basic integrity checks involve validation against the agreed XML Schema
Definition (XSD), confirming that the data are correctly formatted, together with logical
checks upon the type or range of values submitted: for example, a check that any value
given for the date of death is strictly later than those given for dates of treatment.

The manual checks reflect working assumptions regarding the relationships between the
values of different data items submitted, for example, that a certain combination of
treatments would never be used in practice. In each case, some additional information may
be needed to determine whether data is incorrect, or whether the assumptions are invalid.

The system will inform data provides of the outcome of any submission. If the data submitted
fail a basic integrity check, they are rejected, and a report is generated containing

appropriate diagnostic information. If the data are accepted, a confirmation message is
sent, and the data may then be reviewed using a secure interface provided by the LabKey
[8] application. Data can be then be explored and/or exported from the system in a variety
of formats, including .xls, .xlsx, .tsv, and .csv.

RESULTS
The NIHR HIC viral hepatitis research database has been developed and populated with
data. Error! Reference source not found. provides an overview of the data model of the
database and the relationships among different entities. The data collected falls into several
categories: (a) basic information (e.g., demographics, hospital visits, death, discharge, and
study sites), (b) laboratory data, (c) treatments, (d) diagnoses, (e) liver conditions, (f)
hepatitis virus genotypes, and (g) other clinical information.

The database contains 32 tables for storing collected data points, and several tables for data
field definitions. The final database consists of 349 data fields, split into 20 different element
types. There are 203 data fields that are common to HBV, HDV, HCV and HEV whilst other
data fields are specific to HBV and HDV (n=75), HCV (n=47) or HEV (n=24). The full dataset
is included in supplementary data 1. To date, the database contains 3,494 patients with
associated clinical information. There are 842,676 records regarding laboratory tests, 2,824
records regarding imaging data, and 8,514 records for medications (including anti-viral
therapy and others), with data on comorbidities, diagnoses, genotype information, liver
conditions, treatment side effects and social behaviour also included.

Chronic HBV Cohort Description
Data have been extracted from the NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis Research database by using
HBV lab test information. Patients included in the extract meet at least one of the following
criteria:
(a) two positive HBsAg tests, at least 6 months apart;

(b) positive HBsAg and positive HBV DNA, at least 6 months apart.

The characteristics of the chronic HBV cohort of 960 patients are described in Table 2,
including age, gender, race, HCV coinfection, HIV coinfection, comorbidities, the severity of
liver disease, and treatment information. Among these patients, 254 patients (26.5%) have
previously received medications or are currently under treatment. There are 17 patients
coinfected with HDV, with data extracted based on detectable HDV viremia or anti-HDV
antibody. However, there were 475 patients who had no HDV test data.

infection but, can occasionally causes severe disease and/or chronic infection; our data
collection approach sets out to include both categories. Patients included in the extract meet
at least one of the following criteria:
(a) patients with anti-HEV IgM and anti-HEV IgG both positive;
(b) patients with HEV RNA detected in serum and/or stool by RT-PCR.

There are 14 patients with acute HEV infection in our current database. One of these
patients is coinfected with HBV, and this patient is also diagnosed with chronic kidney
disease. Among them, 4 patients are male, and gender information was missing for the other
10. The median age at the time of patients first positive HEV test was 61.5 years (range: 21 86).

DISCUSSION
This paper describes the methodology for the NIHR HIC informatics infrastructure (pipeline)
development for collating data across multiple sites, and presents initial cohorts created as
part of the NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis theme. This demonstrates that routinely collected
patient data can be aggregated across multiple centres to create datasets for research. Data
collected for this collaboration from one site have already been used in an analysis of
HBsAg loss [9] and an analysis of data from all sites is currently underway. Further internal
analysis is planned and collaborations with industry partners have been established to
address specific translational research questions.

Whilst the NIHR HIC viral hepatitis theme has been able to demonstrate that routinely
collected patient data can be aggregated across multiple centres to create datasets for
research, challenges still remain. For example, data submission completeness differs across
sites, as the original data is stored in differently and may be therefore easier to process at
each site. Large amounts of imaging report and biopsy report data remains embedded in
free-text which may contain patient identifiers, meaning it cannot be transmitted to the

central site for processing, and each individual site has to develop free-text anonymisation
protocols or perform manual extraction of this data. With these challenges in mind,
optimisation of the data model will be continued, and a comprehensive data dictionary
continues to be updated accordingly for researchers across the participating centres and
external collaborators. In addition, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for
automatically extracting data and information from free-text examination reports and clinical
notes will be embedded into the data collating process, to eliminate the requirement for
manual extraction.

Through the new pipeline, electronic clinical data collected for the routine care of individuals
with hepatitis B, C, D, and E infection has been collated over the last three years, across five
NHS trusts, and re-used for viral hepatitis research. The datasets created can be requested
by internal and external research groups for analysis; these requests are reviewed and
approved according to the agreed governance procedures. Data collection for the NIHR HIC
viral hepatitis theme is an ongoing process, and other NHS trusts that have signed up to the
NIHR HIC governance framework have been invited to join the collaboration. Collection of
large datasets on viral hepatitis via the NIHR HIC programme is not only a cost-effective
method of data collection but allows novel analyses to be performed, giving further insight
into viral hepatitis in the UK.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1: Data flow for the National Institute of Health Research Health Informatics
Collaborative viral hepatitis clinical exemplar theme. For each participating site, data
originating from clinical systems were used to populate a corresponding data warehouse
that contains data fields in the agreed dataset for viral hepatitis research. Data in the data
warehouse were transferred to the NIHR HIC Viral Hepatitis Central Data Repository. The
data stored in the central data repository can be extracted and provided to internal and
external research groups according to the governance process.

Figure 2: Conceptual data flow for an individual site participating in the National
Institute of Health Research Health Informatics Collaborative Viral Hepatitis clinical
exemplar theme. In an individual site, structured data in the hospital operational systems
were directly transferred into the hospital data warehouse, and data stored in unstructured
format was automatically or manually transformed to produce structured data either before
or after transfer to the data warehouse. In addition, data from paper records or unconnected
data sources were manually entered into a structured electronic data capture system and
transferred into the data warehouse. Data was then anonymised prior to transfer to the
central data repository for viral hepatitis research.

Figure 3: Data model overview of the National Institute of Health Research Health
Informatics Collaborative Viral Hepatitis Research database. The defined dataset for
viral hepatitis research includes 32 entities/tables, which can be grouped into different
categories, marked in different colours. Each patient has a unique clinical data identifier that
is stored in the table “Clinical data IDs”. The relationship between two entities is shown
beside their connection line. For example, 1: 1 between table “Clinical data IDs” and table
“Study subject” indicates that a patient can only have one study subject id; while 1: n
between table “Clinical data IDs” and table “Hospital visit” indicates that a patient could
possibly have multiple hospital visits.
