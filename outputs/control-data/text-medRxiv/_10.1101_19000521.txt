OBJECTIVE
We aimed to systematically review published evidence on the association between puberty
timing and Type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (T2D/IGT), with and without
adjustment for adiposity, and to estimate its potential contribution to the burden of T2D.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We searched PubMed, Medline and Embase databases for publications until February 2019
on the timing of any secondary sexual characteristic in boys or girls in relation to T2D/IGT.
Inverse-weighted random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool reported estimates and
meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity.
RESULTS
Twenty eight observational studies were identified. All assessed age at menarche (AAM) in
women (combined N=1,228,306); only one study additionally included men. In models
without adjustment for adult adiposity, T2D/IGT risk was higher per year earlier AAM
(relative risk (RR)=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.89-0.93, 11 estimates, n=833,529,
I2=85.4%) and for early versus later menarche (RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.28-1.55, 23 estimates,
n=1,185,444, I2=87.8%). Associations were weaker but still evident in models adjusted for
adiposity (AAM: RR=0.97 per year, 95% CI=0.95-0.98, 12 estimates, n=852,268, I2=51.8%;
early menarche: RR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11-1.28, 21 estimates, n=890,583, I2=68.1%).
Associations were stronger among Caucasians than Asians, and in populations with earlier
average AAM. The estimated population attributable risk of T2D in UK Caucasians due to
early menarche, unadjusted and adjusted for adiposity, was 12.6% (95% CI=11.0-14.3) and
5.1% (95% CI=3.6-6.7), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
A substantial proportion of T2D in women is attributable to early menarche timing. This will
increase in light of global secular trends towards earlier puberty timing.

INTRODUCTION
Puberty is the transitional period from childhood to adulthood when physiological and
physical changes relating to sexual maturation occur to attain fertility. The onset of puberty
(Tanner stage 2) is indicated by the appearance of breast buds in girls, genital development in
boys, and pubic hair growth in both sexes (1,2). In the latter period of puberty (at Tanner
stage 3 or 4), girls experience first menstruation, namely menarche (3) and boys experience
voice break (4). Within populations, timing of puberty varies widely by sex and between
individuals. The normal age at onset of puberty ranges from 8 to 13 years in girls and from 9
to 14 years in boys (5,6) and age at menarche (AAM) continues to decline worldwide (5,7-9).
Puberty timing has been widely examined in relation to health outcomes, including Type 2
diabetes (T2D) which is increasingly prevalent worldwide (10). An earlier systematic review
and meta-analysis showed that early menarche was associated with higher T2D risk (11).
That review identified 10 relevant publications (315,428 participants) dated until the end of
2013 and included only two studies in non-Western settings (both were from China) (11),
which did not allow for comparisons between regions. There have been several very large
Asian studies published subsequently (12,13). More importantly, that previous meta-analysis
analyzed only effect estimates adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (11). As BMI was
invariably measured in adults, rather than in childhood, it may be considered as a mediator
between puberty timing and T2D, rather than simply a confounder, although BMI,
overweight and obesity track from early childhood to adulthood (14,15). Comparisons of the
associations between AAM and T2D both with and without adjustment for adiposity would
be informative. Furthermore, a recent study from China reported that the association between
AAM and incident diabetes differed by year of birth, with a stronger association observed in
women who were born in more recent decades (12). Such potential effect modifications were
not investigated in the previous meta-analysis (11).

Here, we describe a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association
between puberty timing and T2D and/or impaired glucose tolerance (T2D/IGT), with and
without adjustment for adiposity, in both women and men. We also assessed study-designrelated factors that could explain the heterogeneity between study estimates. Finally, we
describe, to our knowledge, the first estimate of the potential contribution of early menarche
timing to the population burden of T2D.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Data sources and searches
We searched online databases (i.e., PubMed, Medline and Embase) until 28 February 2019.
The search terms were: i) terms or measures related to puberty timing (e.g. puberty, menarche,
voice break, Tanner); and ii) terms or measures related to diabetes (e.g. diabetes, glucose,
insulin, glycated haemoglobin); and iii) terms related to epidemiological studies (based on
guidelines from Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) (16). Further details of the
search strategy are shown in Supplemental Table 1. All identified papers were screened by
title and abstract, and if considered potentially relevant, the full texts were read for inclusion
decision. Any uncertainty about the eligibility of a particular paper was resolved through
discussion between authors (T.S.C. and K.K.O.). We also reviewed papers included in the
previous systematic review (11) and reference lists of our included papers to identify relevant
papers. The present study was registered in the International prospective register of
systematic reviews (PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42019124353) and the protocol
is available at:
http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42019124353.

Study Selection
Published papers were included in the present systematic review if they reported: i) any
measure of puberty timing either reported in childhood or adulthood (pubertal onset: age at
breast or genital development, or Tanner stage 2 pubic hair) (1,2); pubertal completion: AAM,
voice breaking, and ii) T2D/IGT assessed by self-reported physician diagnosis, fasting
plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test and/or glycated haemoglobin. Other inclusion
criteria were: any epidemiological study in women or men and published in full reports in
English.

Exclusion criteria
We excluded studies that analysed populations with specific diseases such as breast cancer,
polycystic ovary syndrome, Turner syndrome, premature adrenarche and Type 1 or 2 diabetes,
as well as animal studies.

Data Extraction
Data from eligible studies for systematic review were extracted by one author (T.S.C.); a 20%
sample was independently extracted by a second author (R.L.), blinded to the original dataset,
which was verified (100% agreement) by a third author (K.K.O).
Extracted information included first author, publication year, sample size, study
population and ethnicity, year at enrolment, ages at puberty and outcome assessments, mean
AAM, number of cases, definition of outcome, types of outcomes (prevalent or incident
T2D/IGT cases), risk estimates with corresponding confidence intervals (CI), definitions of
early puberty and its reference category, and variables controlled for in multivariable models.
Specifically, for meta-analysis, we selected i) risk estimates for T2D/IGT per year later AAM
as a continuous variable (i.e., dose-response relationship) and ii) risk estimates for T2D/IGT
in the earlier AAM category compared to the middle or older AAM category (i.e., categorical
relationship). We distinguished between estimates from models adjusted for potential
confounders (but non adiposity) and estimates from models adjusted for adiposity indicators
(usually BMI or waist circumference, or preferentially both). If a study reported estimates for
multiple outcomes, we prioritised risk estimates for combined T2D/IGT, followed by T2D
only and IGT only, and included estimates for only one such outcome per study.
For those studies that reported risk estimates for T2D/IGT per year earlier (rather than
later) AAM (17), we calculated the reciprocals to produce risk estimates per year later AAM.

Similarly, for those studies that reported risk estimates for T2D/IGT in an older (rather than
earlier) AAM category (12,18-21) compared to an earlier AAM category as the reference, we
calculated the reciprocals to produce risk estimates in the earlier AAM category compared to
the older AAM category as the reference. For simplicity, we considered odds ratios and
hazard ratios to be similar estimates of the relative risk (RR).

Data synthesis and analysis
To summarize the association between AAM and T2D/IGT, inverse-variance weighted
random-effects models were performed. Estimates from models with and without adjustment
for adiposity indicators were considered separately. Heterogeneity between studies was
quantified by the inconsistency index (I2) (I2<50%, 50–75%, and >75% indicated mild,
moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively). Potential sources of heterogeneity were
evaluated using meta-regression analyses. Publication bias was evaluated using visual
inspection of funnel plots and Egger’s regression asymmetry test. Sensitivity analyses by the
trim-and-fill and leave-one-out methods were performed. Statistical analyses were performed
using the “metafor” package in R software. P values <0.05 were considered to indicate
statistically significance.
Based on the causal assumption that AAM affects T2D/IGT risk, the population
attributable risk for T2D/IGT due to early menarche among British women was calculated
using the formula:

௣ሺோோିଵሻ
, where p is the prevalence of early menarche (defined as <12
௣ሺோோିଵሻାଵ

years) in the large population-based UK Biobank study (22) and RR is the pooled risk
estimate among Caucasians.

The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies (23) was used to assess
the quality of each study included in the systematic review. Criteria for each item in the
assessment scale were defined according to the present research topic before study quality
assessments were performed. For longitudinal studies of incident T2D/IGT and longitudinal
studies which assessed puberty timing in adolescence and early adulthood and subsequent
prevalent T2D/IGT, all 8 items were applied (maximum score of 9). For cross-sectional
studies of prevalent T2D/IGT, only 6 items (maximum score of 7) were used (presence of
T2D/IGT at baseline, and follow-up duration were not relevant).

RESULTS
Study characteristics
Study selection is summarised in Figure 1. The search strategy identified 6155 records. After
removing duplicates and non-relevant studies based on titles and abstracts, 49 texts were
selected for full-text reading and finally 28 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the
review. All 10 studies included in the previous review (11) and studies in the reference lists
of included studies were found by our search strategy.
Tables 1 and 2 (and Supplemental Tables 2 and 3) show the characteristics of the included
studies by prevalent and incident cases of T2D/IGT, respectively. Of the 28 included studies,
all assessed AAM in women (combined N=1,228,306) and only one additionally analysed
age at voice breaking in men (22). The assessment of puberty timing was conducted during
mid-late adulthood in most studies (mean ages ranging 35-70 years), except during
adolescence in one study (24) and in early adulthood (age <25 years) in two studies (17,25).
All were observational studies and one additionally included a Mendelian randomization
analysis (13). Nine studies were conducted among Caucasians (18,19,22,24-29), 13 studies
among Asians (12,13,20,21,30-38) and 6 studies among multi-ethnic populations (Caucasian,
Hispanic, Asian, African-American and Latino) (17,39-43). Fourteen studies examined
prevalent T2D (13,18,19,22,24,25,28,32,34-37,41,43), 2 prevalent IGT (21,30), 3 prevalent
T2D/IGT (26,31,33), 8 incident T2D (12,17,20,27,29,38,39,42), and one prevalent and
incident T2D (40). The definitions of T2D/IGT varied across studies and 4 studies excluded
participants with potential Type 1 diabetes based on age at diagnosis (22,24,40,41). The
adiposity indicators adjusted for in 25 studies were mostly BMI alone (n=19) (17-21,2429,33,35,37-39,41-43), followed by both BMI and waist circumference (n=4) (12,32,34,40),
waist circumference alone (n=1) (30) and body composition (n=1) (22). Early menarche was
defined as AAM <12 years in 9 studies (17,22,27-29,36,39-41) and <14 years in 13 studies

(12,18,20,21,30-35,37,38,42), while the reference category of AAM was defined as AAM

≥12 years in 12 studies (22,27-29,31,33-35,39-42) and ≥14 years in 10 studies
(12,17,18,20,21,30,32,36-38). Furthermore, the reference category of AAM was the middle
category in 12 studies (22,27-29,32-34,37,39-42) and the oldest category in 10 studies
(12,17,18,20,21,30,31,35,36,38).
From models without adjustment for adiposity, most studies (n=20/24) reported a
statistically significant association with higher T2D/IGT risk for earlier menarche
(12,13,17,19,20,22,24,26-30,33-35,37,39-42) or earlier voice breaking (22); only 3 reported
no association (32,36,38) and one study reported that earlier menarche was associated with
lower T2D/IGT risk (31). From models with adjustment for adiposity, some studies (n=11/24)
reported a statistically significant association with higher T2D/IGT risk for earlier menarche
(12,22,26,28-30,33-35,37,41) or younger voice breaking (22), but not other studies (n=11)
(17-21,24,25,32,38,40,42) and two studies reported inconsistent findings between doseresponse and categorical AAM models (27) or between sub-cohorts (39).

Quality assessment
More than half of studies of prevalent T2D/IGT (n=11 studies) scored 6/7, followed by 5/7
(n=4), 7/7 (n=3) and 5/9 (n=2) (Supplemental Table 4). Longitudinal studies of incident
T2D/IGT were rated 9/9 (n=5) or 8/9 (n=4) (Supplemental Table 5).

Meta-analysis results
All 28 studies on AAM and T2D/IGT in women were included in the meta-analysis. Similar
findings were observed between pooled estimates for T2D only and IGT only (Supplemental
Figure 1 and 2). To maximise power, we therefore prioritised risk estimates for combined
T2D/IGT (3 studies), followed by T2D only (23 studies) and IGT only (2 studies).

Figure 2 shows the continuous association between AAM and T2D/IGT. From models
without adjustment for adult adiposity, pooled analysis of 11 estimates from 10 studies
showed that earlier AAM was associated with higher T2D/IGT risk (RR=0.91 per year, 95%
CI=0.89-0.93; n=833,529; Figure 2a). This association was weaker but still evident in models
with adjustment for adiposity (pooled analysis of 12 estimates from 11 studies: RR=0.97 per
year, 95% CI=0.95-0.98; n=852,268; Figure 2b). Similar findings were obtained in subgroup
analyses by prevalent or incident T2D/IGT. Heterogeneity between studies was high in
estimates without adjustment for adiposity (I2=85.4%) and moderate in estimates with
adjustment for adiposity (I2=51.8%).
Figure 3 shows the categorical association between early versus later menarche with
T2D/IGT. From models without adjustment for adult adiposity, pooled analysis of 23
estimates from 21 studies showed that early menarche was associated with higher T2D/IGT
risk (RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.28-1.55; n=1,185,444; Figure 3a). This association was weaker but
still evident in models with adjustment for adiposity (pooled analysis of 21 estimates from 19
studies: RR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11-1.28; n=890,583; Figure 3b). Similar findings were obtained
in subgroup analyses by prevalent or incident T2D/IGT. Heterogeneity between studies was
high in estimates without adjustment for adiposity (I2=87.8%) and moderate in estimates with
adjustment for adiposity (I2=68.1%).

Meta-regression results
Table 3 shows results of univariable meta-regression and pooled RR by subgroups of studies.
Heterogeneity between studies was partially explained by ethnicity and study average AAM.
The associations (continuous and categorical) between earlier menarche and higher T2D/IGT
risk were stronger among studies of Caucasians than Asians, and stronger among populations
with younger than older average AAM. In multivariable meta-regression analyses, only the

contribution of study average AAM was evident, but not that of study ethnicity (data not
shown). Year of enrolment, age at outcome assessment, number of variables adjusted, and the
age cut-off used to define early menarche and the reference category did not explain the
heterogeneity between study estimates (Supplemental Table 3).

Assessment of publication bias and sensitivity analyses
Supplemental Figure 3 shows some asymmetry in funnel plots for studies on the categorical
association between early menarche and T2D/IGT. Publication bias was statistically
significant only for the studies on early vs. later menarche and T2D/IGT with adjustment for
adiposity (Egger’s test, P<0.001).
Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for this publication bias. Supplemental
Figure 4 shows the predicted missing studies using the trim-and-fill method. When the
predicted missing studies were added to the meta-analyses, the continuous associations
(adiposity unadjusted RR=0.91 per year, 95% CI=0.89-0.94; adiposity adjusted RR=0.97 per
year, 95% CI=0.95-0.98) and categorical associations (adiposity unadjusted RR=1.35, 95%
CI=1.21-1.49; adiposity adjusted RR=1.15, 95% CI=1.06-1.24) between earlier AAM and
higher T2D/IGT risk remained similar.
Supplemental Figure 5 shows the results of leave-one-out analyses. When one of the
study estimates was iteratively removed from the meta-analysis, the pooled estimates
remained nearly unchanged for continuous and categorical associations between earlier AAM
and higher T2D/IGT risk, with or without adjustment for adiposity.

Contribution of early menarche to the burden T2D

women (<12 years; prevalence 20.15% in UK Biobank) unadjusted for adult adiposity was

DISCUSSION
The present meta-analysis of observational studies showed that earlier AAM is associated
with higher T2D/IGT risk; this association is weaker but still evident after adjustment for
adult adiposity. Study quality was in general high, and despite evidence of publication bias in
one of the four models, similar findings were obtained in sensitivity analyses that considered
predicted missing studies. Heterogeneity between studies was high and was partially
explained by study differences in ethnicity and average AAM, with stronger associations in
Caucasians and in study populations with lower average AAM. Assuming a causal
relationship, a significant proportion of T2D/IGT among British women may be attributed to
early menarche (before age 12 years). We found a paucity of studies on puberty timing and
T2D/IGT in men.
Our meta-analysis findings are consistent with a previous review (11) but we included a
larger number of studies (19 vs. 10) and women (890,583 vs. 315,428), we distinguished
between findings unadjusted or adjusted for adiposity, and identified reasons for
heterogeneity. While the previous meta-analysis (11) found the association of early menarche
with higher T2D risk in Europe and the United States, we included more Asian studies and
demonstrated that this association was also apparent in Asians, although weaker than in
Caucasians, possibly due to their later average AAM. One study in China reported higher
hazard ratios for incident diabetes associated with younger AAM in women born in the
1960s-1970s than in the 1950s and 1920s-1940s , consistent with the decreasing mean AAM
from 16.2 years in 1920s-1940s to 14.7 years in 1960s-1970s (12). Hence, in light of
worldwide secular trends towards declining average AAM (5,7-9), not only are more women
moving into the high risk group (early menarche), but also the magnitude of elevated risk in
this group appears to be increasing.

The mechanisms that underlie the association between earlier AAM and higher
T2D/IGT risk are unclear. Early menarche is associated with rapid postnatal weight gain (44),
and childhood (45,46) and adulthood obesity (47) which are known to be risk factors for T2D
(48,49). However, our meta-analysis found that the association between earlier menarche and
higher T2D/IGT risk remained, though attenuated, after accounting for potential confounding
and mediating effects of adiposity, suggesting that there may be other adiposity-independent
underlying mechanisms. It has been hypothesized that early menarche is the function of sex
hormone exposure such as higher estradiol (50,51) and lower sex-hormone-binding globulin
concentrations (52) in women, which may affect glycemic regulation and increase risk of
diabetes (53-55). Nonetheless, hormone replacement therapy predominantly with estrogen
was shown to reduce incidence of diabetes (56). Estrogen may have various effects on
different parts of body including brain, adipose tissue, breast, endometrium and endothelium,
probably mediated by different estrogen receptors (57).
We acknowledge several limitations of our study. We could not directly test or quantify
the attenuation in the association when adjusting for adiposity, because the studies that
contributed adjusted and unadjusted estimates were largely but not completely overlapping.
All estimates were from observational studies and thus residual confounding may exist. AAM
was mainly recalled during adulthood, which may affect its accuracy; however, moderate
correlations between prospective and recalled AAM several decades later have been reported
(58,59). Some publication bias was detected especially for the adiposity adjusted categorical
association between early menarche and T2D/IGT, with potential bias towards reporting
positive findings, although our sensitivity analyses were reassuring. The subgroup analyses
by study average AAM were limited to studies that reported this value. Although we
examined both continuous and categorical relationships between AAM and T2D/IGT risk, we
were unable to examine if there was any threshold of AAM that indicates higher risk of

T2D/IGT as indicated by one large study (27). Finally, we found only one study of puberty
timing and T2D/IGT in men, likely because measures of puberty timing in men are not
included in most studies. However, the one identified study was very large (n=197,714) and
reported a statistically robust association between relatively younger (versus about average)
voice breaking and T2D in men (adiposity unadjusted RR=1.44 (95% CI=1.30-1.59;
adiposity adjusted RR=1.24 (95% CI=1.11-1.37)) (22).
In conclusion, observational studies show that earlier AAM is consistently associated with
higher T2D/IGT risk, independent of adiposity. This association is stronger among
Caucasians and populations with younger average AAM. Although the underlying
mechanisms are not well understood, our summary findings quantify the potential benefits of
avoiding early menarche to prevent T2D/IGT.
