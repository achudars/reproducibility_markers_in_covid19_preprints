Abstract
Background Prior studies of U.S. states as of
2013 and one state as of 2015 suggested that
marijuana availability reduces opioid mortality
(marijuana protection hypothesis). This
investigation tested the hypothesis with opioid
mortality trends updated to 2017 and by evaluating
all states and the District of Columbia (D.C.).
Methods Opioid mortality data obtained from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
were used to compare opioid death rate trends in
each marijuana-legalizing state and D.C. before
and after medicinal and recreational legalization
implementation and their individual and
cumulative aggregate trends with concomitant
trends in non-legalizing states. The Joinpoint
Regression Program identified statisticallysignificant mortality trends and when they
occurred.
Results Of 23 individually evaluable legalizing
jurisdictions, 78% had evidence for a statisticallysignificant acceleration of opioid death rates after
medicinal or recreational legalization
implementation at greater rates than their prelegalization rate or the concurrent composite rate in
non-legalizing states. All four jurisdictions
evaluable for recreational legalization had evidence
(p <0.05) for subsequent opioid death rate increases,
one had a distinct acceleration, and one a reversal of
prior decline. Since 2009-2012, when the
cumulative-aggregate opioid death rate in the
legalizing jurisdictions was the same as in the nonlegalizing group, the legalizing group’s rate
accelerated increasingly faster (p=0.009). By 2017
it was 67% greater than in the non-legalizing group
(p <<0.05).
Conclusions The marijuana protection hypothesis
is not supported by recent U.S. data on opioid
mortality trends. Instead, legalizing marijuana
appears to have contributed to the nation’s opioid
mortality epidemic.

Introduction
According to the Institute for Health Metrics
and Evaluation, the United States (U.S.), leads the
world in opioid death rate by more than twice that
of next closest county [Libya]) and is 2nd worldwide
in cannabis use disorder prevalence (Fig. 1).1 Are
these two dire statistics related, and if so, how?

Three prior reports3-5 from the U.S. presented data
supporting the marijuana protection hypothesis:
availability of marijuana reduces deaths from
opioids. Bachhuber et al3 analyzed opioid death rates
as of 2010 after medicinal marijuana legalization in
10 U.S. states. Powell et al4 extended the opioidrelated mortality analysis to 2013 and added 6 states
and the District of Columbia (D.C.) that legalized
medicinal marijuana during 2010-2013. Livingston
et al5 investigated opioid deaths after recreational
legalization in a single state, Colorado, as of
December 2015, 24 months after legalization. These
authors concluded that cannabis legalization was
associated with significantly lower state-level opioid
mortality rates3-5 and that the reduction represented a
reversal of opioid-related death trends.5 Although

According to data at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention,2 the U.S.’s national opioid
death rate trend since 1999 is directly proportional to
the percent of American’s able to access marijuana
legally (p <10-10, Fig. 2). To what extent is this
correlation cause and effect (marijuana use leading
to opioid abuse)?

neither of the first two reports were claimed to be
definitive, editorial commentary6,7 and the public
response8 generally accepted the results as
supportive of legalization. Billboards in major U.S.

trend assumptions. Joinpoint analysis was applied
with weighted least squares, Poisson methods,
logarithmic transformation, and standard errors.
International Classification of Disease (ICD) T
Codes used for the primary analysis were T40.0
opium, T40.1 heroin, T40.2 other opioids, T40.3
methadone, T40.4 other synthetic opioids, and
T40.6 other synthetic narcotics. The opiates
include morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone,
fentanyl, semisynthetic fentanyl moieties, heroin,
opium, codeine, meperidine, methadone,
propoxyphene, tramadol, and other/unspecified
narcotics. The T categories were applied in
conjunction with the following ICD codes: X40X44 accidental poisoning, X60-X64 intentional
self-poisoning, Y10-Y14 other poisoning.

We undertook our study to more adequately test the
marijuana protection hypothesis by evaluating all 50
states and D.C., adding six more states that
subsequently legalized marijuana, extending the
follow-up of all legalizing jurisdictions by four more
years, and including the effect of recreational
marijuana legalization in three more states. We
tested the hypothesis via three comparisons: each
legalizing jurisdiction before and after legalization
implementation; each legalizing jurisdiction relative
to concomitant trends in all non-legalizing states;
and the cumulative aggregate of legalizing
jurisdictions with concomitant trends in nonlegalizing jurisdictions. The results strengthen a
preliminary and partially inaccurate
correspondence10 and do not support the marijuana
protection hypothesis.

Table 1 lists each state and D.C. by whether and when
marijuana legalization for medicinal or recreational
use was implemented. The implementation dates for
jurisdictions that legalized before 2015 are those
published by Powell et al4 and those since were
obtained from other sources.12,13 The earliest available
opioid mortality data on the CDC website is January
1999. One state (California) implemented marijuana
legalization 26 months before the first available
opioid mortality data (Table 1). The two most recent
jurisdictions to legalize marijuana during before
December 2017, Ohio and Pennsylvania, did so in
April and June of 2016, respectively, but did not
implement via state-approved dispensaries for more
than a year.

Methods
Mortality data were obtained from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
National Center for Health Statistics CDC
WONDER Multiple Cause of Death Files2 that
provide death data from 1999 to, as of this
analysis, 2017. All annual death rates obtained
from CDC WONDER were age-adjusted according
to the United States 2000 standard population.
Rarely, when the CDC database provided the
number of deaths and population but not the
corresponding death rate, the rate was calculated
from the deaths and population data.

Each legalizing jurisdiction was evaluated
individually for opioid mortality trends before and
after legalization implementation, if feasible, and
in combination with other legalizing jurisdictions
in a comparison of all legalizing and nonlegalizing jurisdictions (composite analysis).
Legalizing Jurisdictions Four states were
inevaluable for individual trend analysis since
they either implemented legalization too early
(California) before the available opioid mortality
data or too recently (Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania)
to assess their post-implementation opioid
mortality trend (Table 1). Excluding these four
states, a total of 22 states and D.C. were each
evaluable for trend analysis (Table 1).

Trend analysis was performed with the Joinpoint
Regression Program, version 4.6.0.0.11 The
Joinpoint Regression Program identifies trend
inflections (“joinpoints”) to determine when a trend
changes to another trend, the probability range of
the inflection, and the average annual percent
change (AAPC) and p values for each trend
detected. It allows statistical significance testing of
trend differences and does not depend on parallel

Individual Jurisdiction (State and D.C.) Analysis

For individual jurisdictions (state and D.C.) that
legalized marijuana, two comparisons were
conducted: 1) the opioid death rate trends before
and after legalization implementation and 2) the
post-legalization opioid death trend and its
statistically significant AAPCs derived with
Joinpoint Regression Program11 was compared
with the composite of non-legalizing states.

Figure 3 provides the guide to Figures 4, 5 and 6
that depict the annual opioid death rate during 19992017 in each of the individually evaluable 22
legalizing states and D.C. The green and black
curves are the 95% confidence intervals for the
legalizing and non-legalizing jurisdictions,
respectively. The red and green vertical bars indicate
medicinal and recreational legalization
implementation, respectively. Each legalizing
jurisdiction was assessed both for its opioid death
trend compared to the non-legalizing group and for
its trend before and after legalization
implementation.

Non-Legalizing Jurisdictions The nonlegalizing group consisted of 24 states that had
not implemented legalization by December
2017. Georgia was included in the nonlegalizing group since it legalized only CBD oil
and only for epilepsy.
The composite of legalizing and non-legalizing
groups of jurisdictions were compared with the
former aggregated by accumulation of each
legalizing jurisdiction when it implemented
legalization during 1999 2017, after either medicinal
or recreational legalization implementation. Given
the relatively few states that legalized marijuana
during the early years—nine states during 19962007—the comparison between the legalizing and
non-legalizing groups was regarded not to be
meaningful until either the legalizing group rate was
stable or both groups has the same rates, both of
which occurred during 2009-2011. Because the rates
were identical in 2009-2011 and had overlapping
95% confidence intervals in 2012, difference-indifference methodology was unnecessary to compare
the subsequent trends. Because of delays in
implementing medicinal legalization, the two most
recent legalizing states, Pennsylvania and Ohio, were
both evaluated with, and excluded from, the
composite legalizing group.
Results
Analyses of individual legalization jurisdictions
compared with a composite result of non-legalizing
jurisdictions are presented first, followed by
comparisons of a composite of legalizing jurisdictions
with a composite of non-legalizing jurisdictions.

Comparison with Non-Legalizing States
Of 23 jurisdictions individually evaluable for
comparison with the non-legalizing group of
jurisdictions (Figs. 4 and 5), 17 (74%) had
statistically-significantly higher opioid death
rates after legalization implementation than the
non-legalizing group (Fig. 4), as indicated by
separation of the 95% C.I. zones between the
legalizing jurisdiction and the non-legalizing
group (p <0.05). Fifteen (88%) of the 17 had
multiple 95% C.I. separations between them and
the non-legalizing group (p <<0.05). Montana
had the least degree of separation but the trend
thereafter abruptly reversed after medicinal
marijuana access in the state was severely limited
and the number of medical cardholders
plummeted from 31,000 in May 2014 to 9,000
six months later.14 Three states (Arizona,
Minnesota, New Mexico) had trends that were
similar to the non-legalizing group (Fig. 5). Two
states that had a delayed reduction in their annual
opioid death rate ultimately had lower annual
opioid death rates than the non-legalized group
of states (Oregon 15 years later, Hawaii 7 years
later) (Fig. 5). Alaska had acceleration of its
opioid death rate after recreational legalization
that was preceded by 5 years of a declining rate
(Fig. 5). In total, 18 (78%) of the evaluable
legalizing jurisdictions have evidence for
worsening of their opioid death rates than the
non-legalizing group.

.

Comparison of Pre- and Post-Legalization
Trends Four jurisdictions could not be
individually compared for post- versus prelegalization trend since they legalized too early
(California) or too recently (Florida,
Pennsylvania and Ohio) during the available
1999-2017 span of available data (Fig. 6). Of the
evaluable 19 jurisdictions, 16 had acceleration
after medicinal legalization, within 1 to 2 years
in Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts,
Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New
Hampshire, and New York, and within 3 to 7
years in D.C., Delaware, Michigan, Rhode
Island, Vermont and Washington. Maine’s
acceleration began 2 years after medicinal
legalization and again 10 years later. The three
states (Arizona, Minnesota, New Mexico) cited
above with trends similar to the non-legalizing
group also did not appear to have a change in
trend before and after legalization
implementation. Two states (New Mexico,
Arizona) had greater variability after legalization
but ultimately assumed the pre-legalization trend.
Two states (Oregon, Hawaii) appear to have had
a trend reversal after 6 to 9 years

In summary, of the 23 evaluable jurisdictions, 17
states and D.C. (78%) had a statistically-significant
acceleration of their opioid death rates after
medicinal or recreational legalization at greater
rates than the composite rate in non-legalizing
states and/or their pre-legalization rate (Fig. 8).
Three states had no change after legalization
implementation in comparison with their prelegalization trend or with the composite trend in
non-legalizing states. Two states had deceleration
of their opioid death rate after legalization
implementation and in comparison with the nonlegalizing states, but neither of these had, as of
December 2017, statistically-significant lower
rates after legalization implementation than before.
Of four jurisdictions evaluable for recreational
legalization, each had significant (p <0.05)
evidence for subsequent increases in their opioid
death rate and two had either a distinct acceleration
or reversal of prior decline.

Composite Analysis

legalizing and non-legalizing groups for all 9 years
during 2009 2017 was statistically significant
(p=0.009).

Figure 9 shows the annual opioid death rates in
legalizing and non-legalizing jurisdiction during
2009-2017, after 12 states had implemented
(medicinal) legalization. During 2009-2012, the
annual opioid death rate was the same in the nonlegalizing jurisdictions and the cumulative
aggregate of the legalizing jurisdictions. The rate
increases during 2009-2012 also were the same
(AAPC [p-value] = 2.1[0.33] and 3.6 [0.05],
respectively). Thereafter, the death rate increased
one year earlier and more rapidly in the legalizing
group. The annual rate during 2015-2017 (AAPC
= 24.5, p=0.04) was nearly twice that in the nonlegalizing group (AAPC = 13.3, p=0.0001) and by
2017 it was 67% higher than in the non-legalizing
group (p <<0.05). The difference between the

Pennsylvania and Ohio were excluded from the
legalizing group, given that they were the most
recent states to legalize and had not fully
implemented marijuana availability by the end of
2017, the increase from 2016 to 2017 in the
legalizing group was less but still distinctly higher
(37% greater increase as of 2017, p <<0.05, 63%
of 2009-2017 total opioid death rate increase in
legalizing jurisdictions).

in opioid mortality to an increase that exceeded the

The primary result of their investigation was that

Current evidence from the entire U.S., with
more states, D.C. and longer follow-up than
previously reported, does not support the
“marijuana protection” hypothesis. If anything, the
evidence presented here suggests the opposite, with
78% of the evaluable states and D.C. that legalized
marijuana having opioid death rate trends consistent
in greater increases after legalization than their prelegalization rate or concomitant rate in the nonlegalizing states. Collectively, since 2009-2011
when their rates were the same, the legalizing

jurisdictions have had a highly statisticallysignificant greater increase in their opioid death rate
compared to non-legalizing states. The results
implicate the jurisdictions that implemented
marijuana legalization as accounting for nearly
three-fourths of the national opioid death rate
during 2009 2017. Overall, the annual national
opioid mortality rate was highly correlated with the
cumulative proportion of the U.S. population in
legalizing jurisdictions (p <10-10, Fig. 12).

Our investigation has several limitations. Most
important, the ecologic design does not establish
attribution of causation. Other potential
contributing factors other than marijuana
legalization that may have resulted in the
marijuana legalizing jurisdictions having a higher
opioid death rate include strengthening of
prescribing laws and regulations in non-legalizing
states and the reduction of opioid supply in 20102012 and the invasion of illicitly manufactured
fentanyl and fentanyl analogs that started in 2014-

2015 that may have selectively accelerated the
transition to heroin in the legalizing jurisdictions.
As also noted by Bachhhuber et al,3 we could not
adjust for differences between states in
socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, or medical
and psychiatric diagnoses that may have caused
more opioid deaths in the legalizing jurisdictions.

We also could not assess state level variation in the
availability of semisynthetic narcotics (fentanyl
and analogues)17 and of gabapentinoids
increasingly being used to potentiate the euphoric

effect of opioids.18 Nor did we assess federal vs.
local governmental drug policy, funding, and
treatment availability. As emphasized by Pacula et
al,19 we did not account for state-level access to
marijuana due to differences in medical laws
across states (qualifying conditions, presence and
legal protection of dispensaries, etc.) and
recreational laws (passage vs. implementation
dates, retailer density, price). With only four
evaluable recreational-legalizing jurisdictions,
potential differences in the impact of medicinal
and recreational legalization could not be
quantitated, albeit in the U.S. the degree of overlap
between medicinal and recreational cannabis users
has been estimated to be 86%.17 Death certificate
data may have not correctly classified cases of
opioid deaths. With only four evaluable
recreational-legalizing jurisdictions, potential
differences in the impact of medicinal and
recreational legalization could not be quantitated,
albeit in the U.S. the degree of overlap between
medicinal and recreational cannabis users has been
estimated to be nearly 90%.19 We did not use
difference-in-difference, interrupted time-series
design, or synthetic cohort methodologies applied
in prior reports3-5 since the legalizing cumulative
aggregate and non-legalizing group of jurisdictions
had the same rates for three consecutive years
during 2009-2011 and statistically similar rates the
next year, 2012.

only deaths that were not age-standardized.
Although we did not use the difference-indifference methodologies, our selection of
joinpoint analysis has the advantages of direct
pairwise comparison and identifying when trend
changes occur, the probability range of the
inflection, and without requiring parallel trend
assumptions. We included the T40.6 category of
semi-synthetic opioids (including fentanyl and
analogues), which had not been coded prior to
October 201420 and therefore not assessed by
Bachhuber et al3 or Powell et al4. We included
heroin (T40.1) and opium (T40.0) whereas
Bachhuber et al3 did not. (Livingston et al5 did not
specify codes they used).
In retrospect, the prior studies were premature
assessments. The last year assessed by Bachhuber
at al3 was 2010 and by Powell et al4 it was 2013.
Livingston et al5 reported a “reversal of the upward
trend in opioid-related deaths” after recreational
legalization in Colorado, but assessed the postlegalization trend for just 24 months. Our analysis
covers 4 years after recreational legalization during
which there is no evidence of a decline in the
state’s opioid death rate (Fig. 4 upper panel), nor in
a 2019 report from the Oregon Department of
Public Health and Environment.21
If our results indicate that increased availability of
marijuana increases opioid use, abuse or overdose
potential, this interpretation is consistent with other
recent observations. A study conducted by
investigators at the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, New York State Psychiatric Institute and
Columbia University Medical Center concluded
that within 3 years of using cannabis, nonmedical
prescription opioid use increased 5.8 fold (95%
CI=4.2-7.9) and opioid use disorder increased 7.9
fold (95% CI=5.0-12.3).22 A 4-year prospective
cohort study of 1,514 patients with chronic noncancer pain, in whom 24% used cannabis for pain,
those who used cannabis daily or near-daily used
more opioids than those who did not (from their
data we calculated a 39% higher oral morphine
equivalent consumption, p=0.0001).23 In the an
individual-level analysis of a nationally
representative sample, medical cannabis use was
positively associated with greater use and misuse
of prescription opioids.24,25 In another study, selfreported marijuana use during injury recovery was

The current investigation also has several
advantages over the prior reports. It assesses all
states, includes D.C., and evaluates each legalizing
jurisdiction both individually and collectively in a
cumulative composite aggregate. The individual
jurisdiction evaluations include comparisons of
post-legalization and pre-legalization trends,
comparison of post legalization and non-legalizing
jurisdiction composite trends, and both of the
aforementioned comparisons. It adds 16 states,
D.C., and seven additional follow-up years to the
Bachhuber study,3 10 more states and four more
years to the Powell study,4 and two more years to
the Livingston srudy.5 It evaluates medicinal and
recreational legalization effects, both separately
and together, whereas both the Bachhuber and
Powell studies only assessed medicinal
legalization. It evaluates death rates, age-adjusted
for annual rates, whereas Livingston et al5 assessed

associated with an increased amount and duration
of opioid use.26 Conversely, medical prescriptions
for Medicaid and Medicare Part D patients have
been reported to be associated with reductions in
opioid prescribing after legalization.27-30 A
reduction of medical prescriptions for opioids may,
however, increase the pursuit of black market
opioids of uncertain composition and greater risk.31

policy makers, health care providers, state health
officials, or others responsible for influencing and
enacting policies, procedures, and laws related to
cannabis use.67 A more recent review concluded that
recent state regulations that allow medical cannabis
as a substitute for opioids for chronic pain and for
addiction has at best equivocal evidence regarding
safety, efficacy, and comparative effectiveness.66
The investigators concluded that substituting opioid
addiction treatments with cannabis is potentially
harmful and does not meet standards of rigor
desirable for medical decisions.68

Behaviorally and socially, marijuana may be a
gateway to the use and eventual abuse of opioids
and other addicting substances.32-35 Biologically, a
gateway explanation for the marijuana-opioid
connection is plausible since cannabinoids act in
part via opioid receptors36,37 and increase
dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens
similarly to that of heroin and related drugs with
abuse potential.36,38 Clinically, cannabis use may
reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms as a “lowefficacy” agent39,40 but to date, no prospective
evidence, either from clinical trials or
observational studies, has demonstrated any benefit
of treating patients who have opioid addiction with
cannabis.25 Cannabis’ ameliorating effect may also
alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms and thereby
allow opioid use. Legalizing jurisdictions may
have a culturally greater affinity for substance use
disorder in general and be more vulnerable to
gateway mechanisms. Although legalization is
expected to decrease illicit activity, the black
market may paradoxically benefit from access to
more abundant crops, provide lower prices since
none of the legalizing jurisdictions have regulated
cannabis products,41 and by delivering cannabis to
users instead of them having to travel to licensed
dispensaries.

Meanwhile, marijuana use and legalization continues
to expand. This direction in the U.S., when it leads
the world both in cannabis use disorder and in opioid
mortality, merits considering marijuana legalization
as a contributing factor.
Conclusions
Population data in the country with the highest
prevalence of cannabis use disorder do not
support the marijuana protection hypothesis and
may indicate the opposite. Recommendations to
enact laws to allow medical or recreational
cannabis use should not be based on attenuating
the opioid crisis. Before other states and countries
“rush” to legalize marijuana and risk worsening
the opioid crisis, the marijuana-opioid interaction
should be more definitively researched.
Acknowledgements

Trends of individual legalizing jurisdictions and their
composite suggest that, if causally related, it initially
took several years for legalization implementation to
accelerate the opioid mortality rate. As legalization
accelerated in the U.S., however, the interval to
opioid mortality acceleration appears to have
shortened to two years or less (Fig. 12).
A variety of suggestions to reverse the opioid death
epidemic have been offered.31,42-66 In 2017, the
National Academy of Sciences concluded that the
myriad of studies of the public impact of cannabis
use in all its various forms have not appropriately
synthesized, translated for, or communicated to

The authors wish to acknowledge the stress and
harm to families and communities caused by addiction.
We expect that science-driven clinical understanding
and governmental actions will ultimately reduce this
burden.
