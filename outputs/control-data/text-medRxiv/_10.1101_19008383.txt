Abstract
Background
Novel drugs are dynamically changing current treatment regimens for multiple
myeloma (MM). Novel drugs have improved prognosis of MM patients in clinical
studies but are expensive. Little is known about up-to-date real-world application and
costs.
Methods
We performed a retrospective observational cohort analysis (cost-outcome
description; 2012-2017) in a claims database of a major Swiss health insurance
company which covers 14% of the Swiss population (Helsana Versicherungen
AG).We used primary (MM diagnoses via ICD-10) and secondary features
(prescribed MM-specific drugs) as inclusion criteria and defined a hierarchy of drug
regimens to classify treatments as: 1) proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based regimen (e.g.
bortezomib); 2) IMID-based regimen (e.g. lenalidomide); 3) chemotherapy (CHEMO)based regimen (e.g. bendamustin); 4) monoclonal antibody (MAB)-based regimen
(e.g. daratunumab). Direct medical costs of mandatory health insurance were
analysed in 2017 Swiss Francs (CHF; third party payer perspective).
Results
Overall, we identified n=1054 prevalent MM patients (2012-2017) and n=378 incident
MM patients (2015-2017; men: 47.1%; age group <=75 years: 48.7%). The number
of prevalent patients per year increased over time (from n=314 in 2012 to n=645 in
2017).
PI-based regimens were the most frequent first line approach for incident patients
(76.0%), followed by IMID-based (21.9%) and CHEMO-based regimens (2.1%). Only
four patients were treated with MAB-drugs. For later lines, IMID-based regimens
were most often used (2nd line: 56.4%; 3rd line: 2 of 3 patients), followed by PI-based

regimens (43.6% and 1 of 3 patients, respectively). 161 of 1054 prevalent MM
patients (15.3%) were treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT), 4 patients with allogeneic HSCT.
Average costs per patient per treatment line varied considerably (reliable data
available from 2012 to 2014; mean duration of lines between 112 and 388 days): PIbased regimens: CHF 81’352; IMID-based: CHF 73’495; CHEMO-based: CHF 683.
Mean daily costs under MM treatment stepwise increased from CHF 209 in 2012 to
CHF 254 in 2017 (relative increase: 21.5%). Annual direct medical costs in
Switzerland for seven novel MM drugs were extrapolated to be 60.1 Mio CHF in 2012
and 118.6 Mio CHF in 2017 (relative increase: 97.3%), corresponding to mean
annual outpatient MM drug costs per patient of CHF 28’000 in 2017.
Annual death rates decreased systematically from 18.6% in 2012 to 15.5% in 2017 (p
for trend: 0.03). No statistically significant difference in death rates emerged for 2017
compared with 2012 (risk ratio: 0.83; 95%-CI: 0.63 to 1.10; absolute risk reduction:
3.1%).
Conclusions
Current treatment patterns for MM patients in Switzerland show variation concerning
applied drug regimens as well as costs. An increasing prevalent population of MM
patients in combination with increasing costs per day under treatment lead to a
substantial and growing budget impact for the Swiss social insurance system.

Background
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most frequent hematologic malignancy in
Switzerland. Incidence of MM is increasing since 1990 world-wide [1] and it presents
a considerable burden to patients and the health care system. [2] Novel drugs (e.g.
bortezomib, lenalidomide, carfilzomib) have considerably changed current treatment
regimens for MM. Novel approaches have also improved prognosis of MM patients
but are expensive. [2-4] Updated guidelines for Switzerland [2] and for Europe [3]
advise clinicians regarding the translation of current evidence derived from clinical
studies into treatment strategies in clinical practice to secure patient benefit.
Little is known, however, regarding the use of current MM treatment regimens in
routine clinical practice, associated costs and mortality in the real-world setting. [5, 6]
For Switzerland, data exist only from a pan-European study with very few Swiss
patients included. [7, 8]
Health care claims data cover a large population and are increasingly used in health
services research. They are usually reliable as they underly multiple check
procedures and represent a well-established approach to collect and analyse realworld treatment data and costs. Such data allow quantifying the medical and
economic burden of a disease to better understand current public health challenges
and to optimise resource allocation. We therefore used health care claim-based data
to describe the current real-world patterns and associated costs of MM treatment in
Switzerland.

Methods

Study design
We performed a retrospective, observational study (cost-outcome description [9]).
We used the claims database of consecutive cases of a major national Swiss health
insurance company, which covers about 14% of the Swiss population (Helsana
Versicherungen AG).
According to the Human Research Act in Switzerland, approval from a local Ethics
committee was not required for studies using an anonymised database. The study
was partly funded by Amgen Switzerland. The funding party had no influence on the
concept of the study, data collection, analysis or interpretation of results.

Study period and patients
Data were collected from the complete calendar years 2012 to 2017. To be included,
cases had to be insured with Helsana health insurance for the complete calendar
year (prevalence view). In addition, complete three preceding years without
identification of MM were required to allow the inclusion as incident cases (incidence
view). In case of death, cases were included even if their Helsana health insurance
coverage was less than 12 months in that year.Thus, prevalent cases relate to the
years 2012 to 2017 , incident cases to the years 2015 to 2017 (Supplement: Figure
S1). For analyses of treatment lines and costs, we relied on the incident population,
because in this population we could unequivocally identify the first and subsequent
treatment lines of each given case.

Inclusion criteria
The used health insurance database holds no direct information concerning the
diagnosis of their patients treated in the outpatient sector. Thus, we had to rely on an
algorithm using primary and secondary inclusion criteria for MM. For patients with inhospital treatment we used ICD10 diagnosis codes as primary identification (C90.0
Multiple myeloma).
For patients without hospitalisation and without the respective ICD code hospital
discharge codes for identification of MM, we applied a filter algorithm for specific
drugs to select patients suffering from MM with a very high probability (secondary
inclusion criteria). Approved and reimbursed MM drugs in Switzerland (bortezomib,
carfilzomib, ixazomib, lenaladomide, pomalidomide, elotuzumab, daratumumab)
were identified via ATC-codes, as well as other drugs mostly used in the context of
MM treatment (e.g. Bendamustin; Melphalan; Dexamathasone; Zoledronate). Of
these identified cases, we excluded those with additional use of Rituximab (as an
indicator for non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and with the use of iron chelators (e.g.
desferoxamine, as an indicator for Myelodysplastic Syndrome).

Information from claims database
Data were collected for the study population (per person per year) for demographic
attributes (e.g. age, gender, death [yes/no]), health insurance attributes (e.g.
managed care coverage [yes/no]), sequence of MM medications to identify treatment
regimens, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT: Swiss-DRG codes: A15C
autologous; A04C allogeneic) and in-hospital stay due to MM.
Validated death data of the years 2012 and 2013 were taken from an earlier pilot
study. This was necessary as a recoding for some variables in the insurance
database took place during the observation period. Thus, prevalence figures used as

denominators for calculation of death rates in 2012 and 2013 are not identical with
prevalence figures reported in our study for other outcomes than death.

Treatment patterns
We grouped MM treatments according to the major drug backbone into drug
regimens (Table S1): The PI-based regimen for the proteasome inhibitor concept
(e.g. bortezomib), the immunomodulatory (IMID)-based regimen (e.g. lenalidomide),
the CHEMO-(chemo therapy-) based regimen (e.g. bendamustin) and the MAB(monoclonal antibody)-based regimen (e.g. Elotuzumab) [10-12]. In addition, a
hierarchy of regimens was defined (PI > IMID > CHEMO > MAB) to meaningfully
group simultaneously prescribed MM drugs to MM regimens. For example, if
bortezomib and lenalidomide were applied within one drug regimen, the regimen was
defined as PI-based regimen; if lenalidomide and bendamustin were applied within
one drug regimen, the regimen was defined as IMID-based regimen.
As a pragmatic compromise, we defined a new treatment line as a MM treatment
regimen after a “watch and wait phase” of at least 180 days without prescription of a
MM specific drug (i.e. PI-; IMID-; CHEMO-; MAB-drug). As no information was
available in the claims database about the reasons for change of treatment (e.g. due
to relapse or side effects) or treatment breaks (e.g. due to remission), we performed
a validation study to better understand prescription patterns of MM drugs in our
claims database. A visual inspection of diverse MM drug patterns of 16 example
patients showed that a shorter period than 180 days (for example, 60 days) would
erroneously detect a “new line” also in cases where clearly no new line was visible in
the validation patterns. Current Swiss guidelines recommend repetition of drug
regimens after 21 days to 6 weeks within a treatment line [2] and prescription can be
given (and, thus, claims can exist) for several cycles together. For example, one
prescription of 5 drug packages at a time of the same MM drug may hold for 5

therapy cycles within the same treatment line (5 x 28 days = 140 days).
Consequently, the next prescription of the same drug within the same treatment line
after 140 days would mimic a new line, if the limit would be set at, for example, 60
days and not at 180 days.

Health economic analysis
Analysis was done from the perspective of a third party payer (Helsana Insurance
AG). In Switzerland, in-hospital drug costs are in general included in the Swiss-DRG
tariffs and not separately reimbursed by health insurers. In the outpatient sector,
health insurers pay each drug prescription on a fee-for-service base.
Direct medical costs (e.g. total medication cost of MM medications listed in inclusion
criteria) were defined from the database via number of reimbursed units (e.g.
prescribed medication package) multiplied with current Swiss basic health insurance
tariffs (OKP) per unit. Costs for in-hospital treatment in Switzerland are based on
Swiss-DRG cost weights multiplied with a base rate (45% of in-hospital treatment are
paid by the patients’ mandatory health insurance and included in our study; 55% by
public authorities [cantons] and not included in our study). Costs are presented as
2017 Swiss Francs (CHF; official 2017 conversion rate to Euros: 0.85). [13] Out-ofpocket payments and deductibles of the patients were not accounted for. In addition,
we did not apply a discount rate for costs due to the short observation period.
The extrapolation of costs to the Swiss population was performed with Helsana
market shares per stratum as defined in the Swiss risk compensation scheme to
adjust for differences across demographics between the Helsana population and the
general Swiss population. [14] The applied attributes for defining the strata were age
group, canton of residence and gender which result in 32 groups per canton of
residence.

Results
Patient population
We identified n=1054 prevalent MM patients (2012-2017) with 3061 person-years
under observation, and n=378 incident MM cases (2015-2017; study flow Figure 1).
Patient characteristics and the number of patients per year of the two groups are
depicted in Table 1. For prevalent patients, the number of patients per year increased
over time (from n=314 in 2012 to n=645 in 2017), as well as patient age (age group
>75 years: from 38.2% to 47.1%) and managed care coverage (from 33.8% to
49.6%). No clear pattern emerged for other variables. For example, the ratio of
incident patients identified via ICD-code, hence with first diagnosis of MM in a
hospital, varied between 70% and 82% from 2015 to 2017.
When we extrapolated the figures derived from the Helsana sample to the Swiss
population, figures for 2017 did correspond to 61.0 prevalent cases per 100’000
inhabitants (95%-CI: 58.3 to 63.8) and 10.5 incident cases / 100’000 (95%-CI: 8.6 to
12.5).

Drug treatment patterns
Of 378 incident patients, 292 (77.2) provided outpatient drug data with a mean followup of 2.1 years between 2015 and 2017 to assess drug treatment in further detail.
For 1st-line therapy, PI-based regimens were the most frequent approach (76.0%),
followed by IMID-based (21.9%) and CHEMO-based regimens (2.1%; Figure 2). Only
four patients were treated with MAB-drugs, three times as part of PI-based regimens
and once as part of an IMID-based regimen.
Age distribution across 1st-line therapies showed a decrease of the younger age
population from PI-based (age group <=75 years: 59%), over IMID-based (48%) to
CHEMO-based (17%) regimens (Table 2).

Mean duration of 1st-line treatment in 2015 and 2016 was between 210 and 298 days
for PI-based regimens, between 197 and 327 days for IMID-based regimens and
between 30 and 61 days for CHEMO-based regimens (Table S2).
Mean time to next treatment in 2015 and 2016 (TTNT; i.e. interval from last day of
1st-line to first day of 2nd-line treatment) was between 283 and 351 days for PI-based
regimens, and between 216 and 389 days for IMID-based regimens. Only 5 patients
provided data for CHEMO-based regimens (TTNT: 207 to 390 days). Duration of
treatment and TTNT in 2017 were generally shorter, most probably due to the end of
the study time window by December 2017.
During the time window between 2015 and 2017 (mean follow-up: 2.1 years), 237
(81.2%) patients remained in their 1st-line treatment. For 55 of 292 patients (18.8%) a
2nd-line treatment was started. The most frequent 2nd-line regimen was IMID-based
(56.4%), followed by PI-based (43.6%) and no CHEMO-based 2nd line. Three of 292
patients (1%) were also treated with a 3rd-line regimen during our time window (2 of 3
with IMID-based; 1 of 3 with PI-based; no CHEMO-based regimen).

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
From 2012 to 2015, 161 of 1054 MM patients (15.3%) were treated with autologous
HSCT, four patients were treated with allogeneic HSCT (Table S3). All patients with
HSCT were younger than 75 years with a balanced gender distribution as in the total
prevalence population of 1054 MM patients.

Deceased MM patients
The proportion of deceased patients per year showed a systematically decreasing
trend (p for trend: 0.03) during the observation time from 2012 to 2017 (Table 1): 68
of 366 patients (18.6%) died in 2012, 73 of 358 patients (20.4%) in 2013, 89 of 506
patients (17.6%) in 2014, 93 of 568 (16.4%) in 2015, 99 of 620 (16.0%) in 2016 and

100 of 645 (15.5%) in 2017. No statistically significant difference in death rates
emerged for 2017 compared with 2012 (risk ratio: 0.83; 95%-CI: 0.63 to 1.10;
absolute risk reduction: 3.1%; Figure 3).

Treatment costs for MM
Direct medical costs for MM specific drugs per patient per treatment regimen varied
considerably between regimens, as well as between years (Table 3). Valid cost data
for complete treatment lines were available from 2012 to 2014. Cost data of
treatment lines from 2015 to 2017 are not fully reliable due probably many
incomplete treatment lines at the end of observation period. From 2012 to 2014,
mean costs for PI-based treatment lines varied between CHF 74’315 and CHF
94’914 and for IMID-based lines between CHF 59’227 and CHF 85’169. Mean costs
for CHEMO-based regimens were considerably less costly (CHF 285 to CHF 1235).
Mean costs per patient per day under a MM drug regimen were available from 2012
to 2017 (formula: average costs per regimen / average number of days under a
regimen; watch and wait periods without MM drugs are not included herein). Mean
daily costs stepwise increased from CHF 209 in 2012 to CHF 254 in 2017 (relative
increase: 21.5%).
Inpatient costs of patients with autologous HSCT in the year of transplantation show
some variability from 2012 to 2017 (range: CHF 24’597 - CHF 33’090; mean inpatient
all diagnosis costs per patient per year; Table S3).
We extrapolated annual outpatient MM drug costs to the general population of
Switzerland (Table 4). Annual direct medical costs in Switzerland for seven novel
approved and reimbursed MM drugs (bortezomib [Velcade®], lenalidomide
[Revlimid®], pomalidomide [Imnovid®], carfilzomib [Cyprolis ®], elotuzumab
[Empliciti ®], daratumumab [Darzalex ®], ixazomib [Ninlaro ®]) were extrapolated to
be 60.1 Mio CHF in 2012 and 118.6 Mio CHF in 2017 (relative increase: 97.3%). In

2017, the relative share of costs in Switzerland among the four most frequently used
novel agents was 55.3% for lenalidomide, 18.8% for bortezomib, 11.3% for
pomalidomide and 7.1% for carfilzomib.
This corresponds to mean annual outpatient MM drug costs per patient of CHF
28’242 in 2017 (watch and wait periods without MM drugs are included herein; Table
4). In the period 2012 to 2017, annual costs of outpatient MM drugs (mean: CHF
26’224) accounted for about 45% of total annual costs of all-diagnoses inpatient and
outpatient services of myeloma patients (mean: CHF 58’401), as reimbursed by
health insurers based on the Swiss Federal Law on Basic Health Insurance
(KVG/LAMal).

Discussion
In our observational study of a claims database we analysed real-world treatment
data of unselected MM patients in Switzerland in the era of novel MM drugs. PIbased regimens were the by far most frequent 1st-line therapy, followed by IMIDbased and CHEMO-based regimens. Duration of 1st-line treatment in 2015 and 2016
was between 210 and 298 days for PI-based regimens, between 197 and 327 days
for IMID-based regimens and between 30 and 61 days for CHEMO-based regimens.
Time to next treatment (TTNT; i.e. interval from last day of 1st-line to first day of 2ndline treatment) in 2015 and 2016 was between 283 and 351 days for PI-based
regimens, and between 216 and 389 days for IMID-based regimens. For 2nd and 3rdline regimens IMID-based regimens are more frequent compared to PI-based
regimens. 15.3 % of patients were treated with autologous ASCT.
Outpatient costs for MM drugs were highest for PI-based regimens (average costs for
treatment lines started between 2012 and 2014: CHF 81’352), followed by IMIDbased regimens (CHF 73’495). Costs for CHEMO-based regimens were much lower
(CHF: 683), but patients treated with such regimens represent a specific group (only
six patients in our data set with five of them in the age group >75 years).
Extrapolated costs of novel MM drugs to the Swiss national level increased by 97%
from 2012 to 2017. Annual mortality rates of MM patients in the prevalent population
of this sample of a Swiss health insurance from 2012 to 2017 decreased slightly from
18.6% to 15.5% (risk ratio: 0.83; 95%-CI: 0.63 to 1.10).

Strengths and limitations
We applied real-world data of a major Swiss health insurance that provided treatment
information about unselected MM patients from all parts of the country. The database
has been used in several health services research studies in different clinical
domains. [15-17]

Our study has, however, several limitations. First, we were not able to use clinical
charts of single patients to verify diagnosis, provide information about staging or
analyse MM drug treatment and new treatment lines directly from chart reviews in
detail (e.g. to study separation of induction and maintenance therapy or reasons for
ending treatment). Thus, we were only able to include MM patients who had ever
received MM drug treatment or have been treated for MM in a hospital. However, our
filter criteria were developed in cooperation with clinical experts and the chosen filter
variables also used ICD-coded diagnoses of inpatient treatments. For definition of a
new treatment line we used a pause of drug prescription of 180 days as a pragmatic
approach in the light of Swiss guidance for MM treatment [2] and the reported realworld drug prescription modes by our clinical experts. Second, the chosen definition
of three calendar years free of a MM drug prescription or an in-hospital stay without
MM diagnosis for incident cases may still have been too short. Thus, we cannot
exclude a misclassification of some prevalent cases as incident cases but this may
be a rare event. Third, we do not recommend using the extrapolated MM prevalence
and incidence figures for epidemiological questions. Our extrapolated estimates are
likely to be too high as compared with published data that were properly adjusted for
European standard populations. Fourth, we did not have direct information about comorbidities of patients. However, using the validated ATC-codes for medically treated
co-morbidities, [15] we have evidence, that the co-morbidity profile of outpatients
remained basically similar over the observation period. Fifth, some results may not
be reliable due to a short observation time window for patients who entered the study
late. For example, for the analysis of the sequence of treatment lines, study
population with suitable data is decreasing rapidly from line to line. Furthermore,
TTNT may be underestimated for patients who entered the sample in 2017 due to the
relatively short time window until end of observation period. Finally, the Helsana
population is somewhat older than the Swiss general population and not all parts of
Switzerland were equally represented in our study. However, extrapolating the costs

to the country level we accounted for age differences, canton of residence and
gender.

Recent publications with real-world data of MM patients
We compared our findings with recently published real-world treatment data of MM
patients. An observational study from 6 countries [7, 8] included also data from one
Swiss hemato-oncological centre: These cross-country findings are, however, difficult
to compare with our results, as the European authors performed chart reviews of
patients seen during consultation and could, thus, provide detailed clinical
information but no figures about mortality rates and costs.
In the multi-country study [7], the rate of patients receiving a 2nd-line (61%) and a 3rdline therapy (38%) is higher compared with the findings in our incident population
(2nd-line: 19%; 3rd-line therapy: 1%). This may be partly explained with the longer
time since diagnosis (median: 33 months) in the multi-national sample. [7] In addition,
stem cell transplantation is less frequent in our sample (15% vs. 31%). Treatment
patterns are similar with the most frequent 1st-line drug bortezomib (EU: 48%; PIbased regimen in our analysis: 76%). Lenalidomid is the most frequent drug for 2ndline (EU: 59%; IMID-based regimen in our analysis 56%) and 3rd-line therapy (EU:
63%; our findings: 67%. [7] A real world study from the US with data from 2006 to
2014 found a similar pattern. [6] Treatment free intervals between lines (TTNT) in the
EU study are between 10 months (median; after 1st line) and 5 months (after 2nd line).
[8] We found a mean TTNT after 1st-line between 7 and 13 months, for IMID- and PIbased regimens in 2015 and 2016).
A real-world study from the Netherlands assessed treatment costs in MM patients. [5]
Even though this study assessed costs between 2001 and 2009, acquisition costs for
novel MM agents accounted for about one third of total monthly inpatient and
outpatient costs in the Netherlands at that time. We did not calculate total health care

costs per patients of our sample, as we were mainly interested in diagnosis specific
costs of MM treatment. However, it is likely that the increase in costs in our study for
novel MM drugs in Switzerland from 2012 to 2017 accounts for more than one third
of treatment costs in our MM patients.
HSCT was performed in 15.3% of prevalent patients in our study. This is a similar
fraction as in other real-world populations from the US [6] (data from 2006 to 2014:
16.2%) or from the Netherlands [5] (data from 2001 to 2009: 20%). The European
multi-country study [7] showed a higher fraction of HSCT (data from 2014: 31%),
which may be due to an over-representation of patients from University oncology
centers.

Implications for clinicians and public health decision makers
Our study provides evidence, that initial drug treatment regimens show little variability
in accordance with current guidance. [2] However, variability of treatment patterns is
increasing for 2nd- and 3rd-line therapy in our real-world data. Unexpected toxicities or
patient preferences may contribute to such modifications.
Our study shows a significant increase in daily drug costs for MM patients over a six
year period, on the patient level as well as on the Swiss country level. For example,
the introduction of new agents, such as pomalidomide or monoclonal antibodies, was
not associated with a decrease in costs for other myeloma drugs. The doubling of
costs for novel MM drugs on the national level (relative increase by 97% from 2012 to
2017), is probably mainly due a massive increase of the prevalent MM population (as
indicated by a relative increase of MM patients from 2012 to 2017 in our data set of
105%). This may represent the better prognosis of MM patients and may not be due
to a rise in MM incidence, as indicated in our data set. To a lower extend, also
increasing MM drug costs per patient per day have contributed to a higher estimated
spending on the national level. The relative increase of 15% of MM drug costs per

day (CHF 209 in 2012; CHF 241 in 2016) was similar to the relative increase of 16%
in overall health care expenditures in Switzerland during the period 2012 to 2016 [no
official data for 2017 available, yet]). [18]
Surprisingly, the application of novel MM drugs is not (yet?) associated with a
significant decrease in mortality among MM patients from 2012 to 2017. However, we
found a significant trend towards reduced mortality. Admittedly, we have only little
clinical information about the MM patients in our sample, but no reason to believe,
that these MM patients are, beyond the slightly increased age, significantly different
compared to a typical MM population in Switzerland. Our data are in line with the US
SEER registry, where mortality from myeloma in the US population has been slightly
decreasing over the years from 2010 to 2015 in the era of novel MM drugs. [19] Data
from other hematologic diseases have shown decreased mortality rates also on the
population level after introduction of novel drugs. As an example may serve the effect
of imatinib on survival for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, where death rates
in the US in the SEER registry dropped from 0.6 per 100'000 in 2000, the year of
introduction of imatinib, to 0.3 in 2007, where they remained since despite
introduction of newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors. [19]
Our data on novel MM drugs in Switzerland call for an introduction of “Coverage with
Evidence Development” (CED) reimbursement. [20] This form of reimbursement
provides continued access to novel MM drugs in Switzerland and might trigger the
establishment of registries and research. Thus, a framework will be established to
systematically assess and better understand the impact on patients’ outcome and
costs in real-world settings. Monitoring such data on the population level is of
outmost importance, to assess if novel MM drugs are associated with increased
value for health care. [21]

Conclusions
Current treatment patterns for MM patients in Switzerland show variation concerning
applied drug regimens as well as costs. An increasing prevalent population of MM
patients in combination with increasing costs per day under treatment lead to a
substantial and growing budget impact for the Swiss social insurance system.

Table 4: Extrapolated annual outpatient MM drug costs of MM patients in Switzerland from 2012 to 2017.
Extrapolation to Switzerland is based on 1054 prevalent Helsana MM patients from 2012 to 2017. Costs include only outpatient MM drugs as
reimbursed by the Swiss Federal Law on Basic Health Insurance (BHI). Costs of inpatient treatment, of other drugs or of additional services are
not included. MM drug costs are from any treatment line. Prescription date of each MM drug defines costing year. MM drugs are reported from
2012 onwards or from the first year of reimbursement in Switzerland. Costs (CHF; per patient per year): calculated for each calendar year,
irrespective of active MM treatment; thus, watch and wait periods without MM drugs are included herein.
