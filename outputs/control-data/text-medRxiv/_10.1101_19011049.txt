Abstract
Objectives: To compare the reproducibility of 11 antibody assays for IgG and IgM myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-IgG, MOG-IgM) from five international centers.
Methods: The following samples were analyzed: MOG-IgG clearly positive sera (n=39), MOGIgG low positive sera (n=39), borderline negative sera (n=13), clearly negative sera (n=40),
and healthy blood donors (n=30). As technical controls, 18 replicates (9 MOG-IgG positive and
9 negative) were included. All samples and controls were re-coded, aliquoted, and distributed
to the five testing centers which performed the following antibody assays: five live and one
fixed immunofluorescence cell-based assays (CBA-IF, five MOG-IgG, one MOG-IgM), three
live flow cytometry cell-based assays (FACS-CBA, all MOG-IgG), and two enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA, both MOG-IgG).
Results: We found excellent agreement (96%) between the live CBAs for MOG-IgG for
samples previously identified as clearly positive or negative from four different national testing
centers. The agreement was lower with fixed CBA-IF (90%) and the ELISA showed no
concordance with CBAs for detection of human MOG-IgG. All CBAs showed excellent interassay reproducibility. The agreement of MOG-IgG CBAs for borderline negative (77%) and
particularly low positive (33%) samples was less good. Finally, most samples from healthy
blood donors (97%) were negative for MOG-IgG in all CBAs.
Conclusion: Live MOG-IgG CBAs showed excellent agreement for high positive and very good
agreement for negative samples at four international testing centers. Low positive samples
were more frequently discordant than in similar assays for other autoantigens. Further
research is needed to improve international standardization for clinical care.

INTRODUCTION
Immunoglobulin G antibodies to myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) are found in
adults and children who present with a spectrum of central nervous system features that
include optic neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), myelitis, seizures,
encephalitis, brainstem and/or cerebellar involvement. In addition, the presence of MOG-IgG
can discriminate these disorders from multiple sclerosis (MS) 1. Numerous studies have used
different immunoassays for MOG-IgG detection, but it is now clear that native full-length human
MOG as an assay substrate is crucial to make this clinical distinction. When measured using
older generation assays (ELISA, western blot), MOG-IgG are prevalent and have been
identified in healthy individuals and patients with a wide variety of clinical presentations. Thus,
their detection was initially considered to have little clinical utility. However, when measured
by live cell-based assays (CBA) an association between MOG-IgG antibodies and a non-MS
demyelinating phenotype has been established. This understanding has driven the
establishment of different variants of MOG-IgG assays with native MOG substrates in multiple
centers world-wide. There is limited data on assay reproducibility between these centers. In
this study, we compared the most frequently used assays for MOG-IgG detection, such as live
and fixed immunofluorescence cell-based assays (CBA-IF) 2-18, live flow cytometry cell-based
assays (CBA-FACS) 4, 19-28, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 29, 30.
METHODS
Patients and controls
The clinical laboratories (Innsbruck, Mayo Clinic, Oxford, and Sydney; centers 1-4) sent the
following groups of coded serum samples and clinical information to the Institute for Quality
Assurance (IfQ; Lübeck, Germany):
Phase I: 89 coded samples sent to centers 1-4 and center 5 (Euroimmun) for testing
(figure 1)
1. MOG-IgG clearly positive: thirty-nine blinded samples from all labs with a previously
determined clearly positive MOG-Ab serostatus (high titers or FACS binding ratios,
supplementary methods, etable 2), all of them diagnosed with inflammatory demyelinating
diseases known to be associated with MOG-IgG (such as ADEM, AQP4-antibody negative
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), optic neuritis, myelitis, and other
demyelinating diseases).
2. MOG-IgG clearly negative (negative or very low titers or FACS binding ratios,
supplementary methods, etable 2): forty blinded samples from all labs with a previously
determined clearly negative MOG-Ab serostatus. Eighteen of the forty samples were from

people who also presented with clinically overlapping features such as optic neuritis,
myelitis, ADEM, or encephalitis. The other samples were from controls (seven from people
with MS, five from people with other neurological diseases and ten from healthy controls).
3. Ten technical controls (humanized monoclonal MOG-Ab 8-18-C5 31, five samples IgG1 and
five samples IgM (kappa) in different dilutions, but of unknown IgG or IgM concentration,
contributed by center 5.
Phase II: 100 coded samples sent to five centers for testing (18 repeat and 82 new, figure
1)
4. Nine positive and nine negative samples from phase I were sent out a second time to
assess inter-assay variations.
5. Thirty healthy blood donors were contributed by the IfQ. No clinical information was
available and samples were not pretested for antibodies against MOG or other
autoantigens.
6. MOG-IgG low/borderline positive: thirty-nine blinded samples from all labs with a previously
determined low positive MOG-IgG serostatus (just above the individual cut-off values,
supplementary methods, etable 2). Thirty-six of these samples were from people with
inflammatory demyelinating diseases associated with MOG-IgG and three were from MS
patients.
7. MOG-IgG borderline negative: thirteen blinded samples from all labs with a previously
determined borderline negative MOG-IgG serostatus (just below the individual cut-off
values, supplementary methods, etable 2). Five of these samples were from patients with
inflammatory demyelinating diseases associated with MOG-IgG and eight were from
controls (three from people with MS and five from people with other neurological diseases).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.
The present study was approved by the ethical committees of Medical University of Innsbruck
(AM3041A and AM4059), Oxford (REC 16/SC/0224), Mayo Clinic (IRB 08-007810) and
Sydney (NEAF 12/SCHN/395). All samples were anonymized before sending to the blinding
center.
Laboratory methods and analysis
All samples and controls were re-coded, aliquoted, and distributed by an investigator not
involved in antibody testing from the IfQ, Lübeck, Germany, to the five testing centers which
performed the 7 live CBAs (4 CBA-IF and 3 CBA-FACS) one fixed CBA-IF for MOG-IgG, one
live CBA-IF for MOG-IgM and 2 ELISAs for MOG-IgG in the two study phases (figure 1, table
1 and supplementary methods).

Statistical analysis
Upon completion of the testing, the assay results from each center were entered onto a webbased database. The data were then unblinded and analyzed. Statistical analyses were carried
out using IBM SPSS software (release 24.0, IBM, Armonk, NY) or GraphPad Prism 8
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Correlation of parameters was analyzed with Spearman’s nonparametric correlation. Kappa statistics was used to assess the concordance between assays.
All graphs were created using GraphPad Prism.
Data availability statement
The dataset used and analyzed during the current study is included in the main text and the
supplementary files.
RESULTS
CBAs for MOG-IgG show a very good agreement on clear positive and negative samples
In the first phase of this study (figure 1, phase 1) all centers analyzed samples sent as clearly
positive (n=39) or negative (n=40) by centers 1-4 (figure 2 A, etable 3). In general, there was
a very good agreement for the 8 MOG-IgG CBAs (figure 2 B): 39/40 (97.5%) samples sent as
negative were negative in all 8 CBAs. This agreement was 100% if the fixed commercial CBA
was excluded. For the samples submitted as positive 32/39 (82%) samples were concordant
across all 8 CBAs; again, this improved to 92% (36/39) if the fixed CBA was excluded. Overall
there was 96% concordance across all samples when tested on live platforms in four
international testing centers. The concordance dropped to 90% if the results of the fixed CBA
tested in-house at center 5 were included.
MOG-IgMs at a titer ≥ 1:160 were a rare finding in samples sent as clear positive (5/39, 13%).
One of these 5 samples had a high MOG-IgM titer (1:5120, figure 2 C, assay Nr. 9, large grey
dot) and was low positive for MOG-IgG in four assays (using IgG(H+L) and IgG1 secondary
antibodies), but negative in 4 assays (using IgG(Fc) and IgG1 secondary antibodies). The
other 4 samples were positive for MOG-IgG in all CBAs. MOG-IgMs at a titer ≥ 1:160 were
absent in all 40 samples sent as negative.
Overall, there was excellent agreement between the seven live MOG-IgG CBAs (median
kappa value 0.975, range 0.924 to 1.000). The agreement of the fixed MOG-IgG CBA with the
live MOG-IgG CBAs was very good (median kappa value 0.822, range 0.821 to 0.847). There
was no agreement between the MOG-IgG and MOG-IgM CBAs (median kappa value -0.003,
range -0.180 to 0.103), or between the MOG-IgG CBAs and the ELISA (median kappa value
0.112, range 0.105 to 0.203).

The quantitative values for all assays are provided in figure 2 C. Most of the assays had a very
clear separation of positive and negative samples. The quantitative range in which an
individual sample is positive in all live CBAs is indicated by the dotted line and shaded in darker
grey (100% probability). For example, if a result of assay Nr. 1 is positive with a MOG-IgG titer
of 1:1280 then there is 100% probability that this result is also positive in all other live CBAs.
However, on the same assay a MOG-IgG titer of 1:320 (light grey area) is more likely to have
discrepant results between centers.
It is evident that there is very good correlation of quantitative results for the seven live MOGIgG CBAs (median Spearman’s correlation coefficient R=0.866, range 0.806 to 0.961; figure 3
A) and a lower correlation between the fixed CBA and the live MOG-IgG CBAs (median
R=0.800, range 0.778 to 0.809). There was no correlation between the MOG-IgG and MOGIgM CBAs (median kappa value -0.071, range -0.134 to 0.179) or the MOG-IgG CBAs with
ELISA (median R=0.094, range 0.060 to 0.273). These correlations are shown in more details
in one illustrative assay per center (figure 3 B, assays Nr. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8). Although the separation
of negative and positive samples was very good for the live CBAs (assays Nr. 2, 4, 6, and 7),
the fixed assay (Nr. 8) was negative for 5 samples clearly positive in the live CBAs.
As a technical control we included 10 samples containing humanized monoclonal MOG-IgG
(5) or MOG-IgM (5) antibodies provided by center 5. Results are shown in supplementary
results (efigure 2). Importantly, these humanized monoclonal antibodies were not recognized
by some of secondary antibodies, particularly the anti-human IgG1 antibody. Moreover, the
anti-human IgG(H+L), but not the IgG(Fc) secondary antibodies, also recognized the
humanized monoclonal MOG-IgM at the lowest dilution as borderline negative for MOG-IgG.
MOG-IgG results are reproducible within centers
All centers reproduced the MOG-IgG results from their samples submitted for phase I and the
9 positive and 9 negative replicates that were resent blinded and integrated into the cohort with
the borderline samples in phase II (figure 3 C and supplementary results, efigure 3 and etable
3).
CBAs for MOG-IgG show less agreement on low positive and borderline negative
samples
In the second phase of this study (figure 1, phase II) we analyzed samples sent as low positive
(n=39) or borderline negative (n=13) by the participating centers and 30 samples from healthy
blood donors. Qualitative results obtained by the different CBAs for MOG-IgG are shown in
figure 4 A and supplementary results, etable 3. In general, there was a good agreement for
the eight MOG-IgG CBAs for the samples from blood donors: 29 of the 30 samples (97%) were
negative in all eight CBAs and one sample was positive in four CBAs (figure 4 B).

The agreement for low positive samples was less good: 2 of the 39 samples (5%) sent as
borderline positive were negative in all 8 CBAs and only 11 samples (28%) were positive in all
8 CBAs. Therefore, the CBAs had a complete agreement of 33%. The remaining 26 samples
(67%) were positive in 7 (n=8), 6 (n=2), 5 (n=6), 4 (n=2), 3 (n=3), 2 (n=2) and 1 (n=3) assays.
The agreement for borderline negative samples was better: 10 of the 13 samples (77%) were
negative in all 8 CBAs and no sample (0%) was positive in all 8 CBAs. Therefore, the CBAs
had a complete agreement of 77%. The remaining three samples (23%) were positive in 7
(n=1), 3 (n=1), and 1 (n=1) assays.
The quantitative values for all MOG-IgG CBAs are provided in figure 4 C. From this figure it is
evident that many of the positive signals are around the cut-off, and under the quantitative
range described above for samples positive in all live CBAs.
Further, MOG-IgMs at a titer ≥ 1:160 were a rare finding in samples sent as low positive (n=5,
all 1:160) and absent in samples sent as borderline negative or blood donors. These 5 samples
were positive for MOG-IgG in 1 (n=1), 4 (n=1), 5 (=2) and 6 (n=1) CBAs.
Samples identified as MOG-IgG positive in all CBAs are associated with a non-MS
demyelinating disease course
None of the 13 clinically definite MS patients in the study or the five patients with other
neurological diseases were within the 47 patients who tested positive on all live CBAs
(supplementary results, efigure 4). These 47 patients had typical MOG-IgG associated clinical
phenotypes such as optic neuritis, ADEM, myelitis, AQP4 seronegative NMOSD or other
demyelinating phenotypes reported to be associated with MOG-IgG. The 32 discordant
samples were from 27 patients with typical MOG associated clinical phenotypes mentioned
above, but also from a healthy blood donor and four MS patients. Finally, the 82 samples
negative in all live CBAs were from 24 patients with typical MOG associated clinical
phenotypes, MS (9), other neurological diseases (10) and healthy controls (39).
DISCUSSION
In this study we compared the reproducibility amongst the most frequently used assays for
serum MOG-IgG detection, such as live and fixed CBA-IF, live CBA-FACS, and ELISA. Our
data clearly indicate that strong positive and clearly negative samples are reproducible
between centers where live cells expressing native full-length human MOG are used as the
assay substrate. In the four different national testing centers using different live CBAs there
was 96% concordance for all samples tested. The agreement was less good when a fixed
CBA-IF (90%) tested in-house by the company (center 5) was included which is consistent
with recent studies demonstrating that some conformational epitopes of MOG are lost upon
fixation of MOG-expressing cells 4, 17, 27. Importantly, most of these discordant negative results

on the fixed MOG-IgG assay had high MOG-IgG titers in live CBAs and were from typical
MOG-IgG associated demyelinating syndromes. There is utility in the commercial fixed MOGIgG testing in places where live MOG-IgG CBAs are unavailable, but this assay will miss 1015% of positive cases. A recent study highlighted an issue with specificity in commercial MOGIgG testing, particularly in samples that were only positive at low dilutions 4. Therefore,
clinicians should consider retesting unexpected MOG-IgG results at centers offering live CBAs.
Finally, ELISAs did not distinguish between the positive and negative patient samples and
showed no concordance with CBAs for detection of human MOG-IgG conclusively
demonstrating that ELISAs are not suitable for the detection of human MOG-IgG. Although
this has been shown in several studies (summarized in

29

), some laboratories still use this

method for MOG-IgG detection. We hope that our findings inform neurologists that only CBAs
should be used for the measurement of human MOG-IgG. Moreover, and in agreement with
previous studies 4, 17, 27, live CBAs remain the gold standard for the detection of human MOGIgG.
The agreement of MOG-IgG CBAs for low positive sample was less good (33% concordance)
and MOG-IgG assays were particularly discordant at the borderline of positivity. This raises
the pertinent question where to draw cut-off values and how they influence the clinical
interpretation of diagnostic results. If we examine the clinical phenotype of people with high
MOG-IgG levels, which are consistently detected by all CBAs, we identify patients with nonMS demyelinating phenotypes (such as ADEM, NMOSD, optic neuritis, myelitis, and other
demyelinating diseases) 1. In contrast, the low positive samples which showed a lack of
reproducibility between centers had a wider range of clinical phenotypes that mostly include
the same phenotypes (ADEM, NMOSD, optic neuritis, myelitis and other demyelinating
diseases), but also a proportion of every control group (clinically definite MS, other neurological
diseases and healthy individuals) making their interpretation difficult. It is unlikely that lower
levels of pathogenic antibody cause a wider disease presentation suggesting that some of
these phenotypes are not driven by MOG-IgG. Hence an argument can be made that the
presence of low positive MOG-IgG is only meaningful in the “correct clinical context” such as
in patients with ON, myelitis, ADEM or encephalitis but not in the context of other diseases,
particularly MS,1, 20, 32. This is a circular but reasonable interpretation of low positive results,
but with caveats. There will be a false-positive rate even within the correct clinical context that
should be considered and an estimate of this would be useful for any test. Secondly, clinical
criteria are not perfect. There are individuals who fulfill criteria for MS, but are often atypical;
perhaps the MOG-IgG result has utility in this context in ruling out MS, and should not be
ignored out of hand. Importantly, when extrapolating from experiences on the treatment of
NMOSD and a recent larger study on treatment of patients with MOG-IgG from France,
disease modifying treatments for MS may not work in MOG-IgG positive patients and may

even exacerbate disease

1, 32-34

. The third interpretation is that these low positive results that

are not reproducible between centers are not useful clinically and in fact dilute the utility of a
more specific test. Finally, as a general consideration in samples not taken at disease onset,
other confounding factors such as preceding steroid use or other immunosuppressive
treatments and remission could lower a positive MOG-IgG result. It is important to note that
MOG-IgG levels are often non-normally distributed in large patient cohorts, and a skewing
towards these lower MOG-IgG titers has been observed in many studies 1.
Further work is now needed to better define the most useful clinical cut-off and to establish if
there is any added benefit in identifying patients with “low positive” MOG-IgG. We propose that
this should be done in a collaborative effort. We need to better characterize “false positive”
cases, such as classical MS cases, other neurological diseases, and healthy individuals, and
get more information on the clinical sensitivity and specificity of all assays by using appropriate
controls, such as systemic autoimmune diseases, non-inflammatory neurological controls, and
healthy controls. It is of great interest to establish how these antibodies relate to different
clinical phenotypes and whether they are a mixture of pathogenic and bystander antibodies
that all bind MOG in vitro.
To conclude we have shown that currently used live CBAs to measure MOG-Abs showed
excellent agreement for clearly positive and negative samples, but low positive samples were
more discordant. Further work is now required to standardize the clinically most useful assay.

Live CBA-IF IgG(H+L): live CBA-IF using HEK293 cells transiently
transfected with a recombinant plasmid expression vector for human
full-length MOG fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP).
Screening was done at 1:20 and 1:40 dilutions and bound MOG-IgG
was detected using an anti-human IgG(H+L) secondary antibody. The
cut-off value for seropositivity was a titer ≥ 1:160. This assay was
performed as described before 2, 5.

2

Live CBA-IF IgG(Fc): live CBA-IF using HEK293 cells transiently
transfected with a recombinant plasmid expression vector for human
full-length MOG fused to EGFP. Screening was done at 1:20 and 1:40
dilutions and bound MOG-IgG was detected using an anti-human
IgG(Fc) secondary antibody. The cut-off value for seropositivity was a
titer ≥ 1:640. This novel assay and its initial validation are described in
detail in supplementary methods.

Live CBA-FACS IgG(Fc): live CBA-FACS using HEK293 cells stably
transduced using a recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing
human full-length MOG fused to EGFP. Screening was done at 1:100
dilution and bound MOG-IgG was detected using an anti-human
IgG(Fc) secondary antibody. The delta median fluorescence intensity
of MOG-expressing cells minus control cells was normalized by a
control serum with known MOG-IgG binding values to control for the
inter-assay variation (binding ratio). The cut-off value for seropositivity
was a binding ratio ≥ 5. This novel assay and its initial validation are
described in detail in supplementary methods.

Live CBA-FACS IgG1: live CBA-FACS using HEK293 transiently
transfected with a recombinant plasmid expression vector for human
full-length MOG fused to Aequorea coerulescens green fluorescent
protein (AcGFP). Screening was done at 1:20 dilution and bound MOGIgG was detected using an anti-human IgG1(Fc) specific secondary
antibody. The cut-off value for seropositivity was a binding ratio (ratio
between transfected and non-transfected cells) ≥ 2.5. This assay was
performed as described before 4, 20, 28.

Live CBA-FACS IgG(H+L): live CBA-FACS using HEK293 “stably”
transduced with a lentivirus including the human full-length MOG (α1
isoform) separated from a fluorescent protein reporter (ZSGreen) with
an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Screening was done at 1:50
dilution and bound MOG-IgG was detected using an anti-human
IgG(H+L) secondary antibody. MOG-IgG levels were obtained from the
delta median fluorescence intensity (ΔMFI): ΔMFI = MOG MFI – control
MFI. The positive threshold was set at three standard deviations (3SD)
above the mean of age-matched controls (n=24, data not shown).
Samples were reported positive if they were above the threshold in at
least two of three quality-controlled experiments. This assay was
performed as described before 19, 23, 27.

Fixed CBA-IF IgG(Fc): commercial fixed CBA-IF using HEK293
transiently transfected with a recombinant plasmid expression vector
encoding human MOG X11 isoform and fixed with formaldehyde.
Screening was done at 1:0 dilution and bound MOG-IgG was detected
using a fluorescein-labelled anti-human IgG(Fc) secondary antibody.
The cut-off value for seropositivity was a titer ≥ 1:0. This assay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Euroimmun,
Lübeck, Germany).

Live CBA-IF IgM: live CBA-IF using HEK293 cells transiently
transfected with a recombinant plasmid expression vector for human
full-length MOG fused to EGFP. Screening was done at 1:20 and 1:40
dilutions and bound MOG-IgM was detected using an anti-human IgM
secondary antibody. The cut-off value for seropositivity was a titer ≥
1:160. This novel assay and its initial validation are described in detail
in supplementary methods.

ELISA IgG (commercial ELISA): Screening was done at 1:40 dilutions
and bound MOG-IgG was detected using an anti-human IgG secondary
antibody. The cut-off value for seropositivity was ≥ 150ng/ml. This
assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Anaspect, Fremont CA, USA).

11

ELISA IgG(Fc): A proprietary soluble MOG isoform X11 variant
produced in HEK293 cells purified under non-denaturing conditions
was used to coat Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates. The preliminary cut-off
value for seropositivity was determined by the mean value of the optical
density plus 3 standard deviations of a cohort of randomly selected
plasma samples of healthy blood donors. Screening was done at 1:100
dilutions and bound MOG-IgG was detected using a peroxidaselabelled anti-human IgG(Fc) secondary antibody and TMB as
colorimetric substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1N
H2SO4 after 15 minutes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

1. Supplementary methods for Center 1 (Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria)
Assays Nr. 1, 2 and 9 (live CBA-IF)
For this study we used our live CBA-IF MOG-Ab assay as initially described in 2011

2, 5

and

now widely used not only by our group, but also by other laboratories (assay Nr. 1). Our MOGAb assay was reevaluated in a blinded fashion by the German NEMOS study group in 2016
14

, with an excellent specificity of 99.5% (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00) in 222 controls (MS, neurological

and healthy controls). Further, a large blinded study using our MOG-Ab assay revealed a
specificity of 100% in 200 patients with chronic progressive MS 35.
In response to a report of possible co-detection of IgM MOG-Ab with the anti-IgG (H+L)
secondary antibody used in our original assay 3, we have refined our assay by using a human
IgG(Fc)-specific secondary antibody instead of an anti-human IgG(H+L) secondary antibody
14, 15

.

For all CBAs HEK-293 cells were grown in 75cm2 flasks using DMEM culture medium
containing 4.5g/l glucose, 10% FCS, 4mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 1xnonessential amino acids (NEAA, Life Technologies) and passaged every 3 days.
HEK-293 cells were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates (TPP) at a density of 200.000
cells/ml using the culture medium mentioned above. 24h after seeding, transfection was
performed using the pEGFP-N1-hMOGalpha1 plasmid and the transfection reagent Fugene
HD (Promega). Cells were maintained in a humified incubator until commencing the assay.
In principal, the set-up of the different analysis was designed to avoid multiple thawing cycles:
Therefore, sera were first screened at a dilution of 1:20 and 1:40 using the anti-human IgG
H+L antibody (assay Nr. 1) and in parallel in serial dilution 1:20 to 1:160 using the human antiMOG IgMµ-specific antibody (assay Nr. 9) as most patient IgM titers can be found in this range
according to our experience. After detection of a positive signal during the screening procedure,
sera were retested using serial dilutions in two-fold steps starting at 1:20. Human anti-MOG
IgG Fc-specific testing (assay Nr. 2) was performed according to the screening result of the
IgG H+L result: If negative, the negative result was confirmed by sera dilutions 1:20 and 1:40.
In case of positive IgG H+L signals, serial titrations were carried out in parallel to the IgG H+L
titrations and (possible) IgMµ titrations to thaw the sample only 2 times for all CBA-IF analysis.
Briefly, 24h post-transfection, plates were removed from the incubator and the culture medium
was replaced by blocking solution, consisting of 0.2 µg/ml goat IgG (Sigma) in 10% heatinactivated FCS in PBS (Sigma, assay buffer). After 10 minutes, blocking was removed and
diluted samples were added, followed by an incubation for 1h at 4°C. Thereafter, cells were
washed three times using assay buffer, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary
antibody (Cy 3TM-conjugated anti-human IgG H+L, Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-166-088,

in assay buffer) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with assay
buffer and finally DAPI (0.1 µg/ml in assay buffer, Sigma) was added to indicate dead cells.
Screening and determination of titer levels was performed by two investigators, both using
individual result sheets and being blinded to the results of the other. The microscope was a
Leica 4000B with a BGR filter. End-point titer levels were defined by the last dilution at which
a specific signal was observed. Concordance rate between raters was 100%.
Assays Nr. 2, 3 and 9 were validated using 322 serum samples from people with inflammatory
demyelinating diseases and healthy controls. eFigure 1 and eTable 1 show the results for the
initial validation of this assay including the definition of the cut-off value and the comparison
with our original IgG(H+L) assay. From eTable 1 it is evident that the specificity of assay Nr. 2
is higher than that of our initial MOG-Ab assay (assay Nr. 1), which is mainly due to the
elimination of cross-reactive IgM seropositive samples.

Assay Nr. 3 (live CBA-FACS)
HEK293 cells were transduced with commercially purchased adeno-associated virus (AAV)
vectors containing AAV2-CMV-hMOG-GFP (SignaGen Laboratories, Rockville, MD, USA).
According to the maufacturer´s guidelines, 0.5 Mio cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and
infected with virus at a concentration of 0.1 Mio multiplicity of infection (MOI), stored and
incubated overnight at 37°C and 8% CO2. Cells were then transferred into new culture medium
and transduction efficacy was measured by fluorescent activated cell sorting measuring the
expressed GFP signal. Transduced cells were cultured for two weeks and subsequently singlecell sorted by our core facility. GFP expressing single cells were collected in a 96-well plate
and successively expanded. All analysis was performed with a monoclonal cell line derived

from one single AAV-MOG transduced clone showing surface expression of MOG and good
GFP expression.
The CBA-FACS assay was performed using HEK293 (HEK) cells and AAV-MOG-GFP
transduced HEK293 (AAV-MOG) cells. For the assay, both cell lines were trypsinized, counted
and mixed equally (1+1) to a density of 2 Mio/ml in 10% heat-inactivated FCS in PBS
containing 1mM EDTA (FCS-EDTA). The cell mixture was placed on an upside-down rotator
in the dark at room temperature for one hour of recovery. Sera were spun down at 10000g for
5min and diluted 1:50 in FCS-EDTA buffer. After recovery, 100µl/well of cells were transferred
into a round-bottom 96 well plate (TPP) and 100µl/well of sera added in duplicates, giving a
final serum dilution of 1:100. In addition to the analyzed samples, three control sera (high,
medium, negative), as well as a calibrator serum and blank were added to each plate. The
calibrator was placed in two duplicates on different positions on the plate to control for and
ensure equal conditions for all samples. After one hour at 4°C on a horizontal shaker, cells
were washed three times with FCS-EDTA and the secondary anti-human IgG Fc-specific APClabelled antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-135-098) was added (100µl/well) for
30min at room temperature in the dark on a horizontal shaker. After two more washing steps,
the cell pellet was dissolved in 30µl/well 1mM EDTA in PBS and 100µl/well cell-fix solution
(BD) were added. Cells were fixed at 4°C for 15min. Measurement was performed on an Accuri
C6 flow cytometer (BS), gating on the cell population as a whole and further gating on HEK
only and AAV-MOG populations, restricting uptake to 10000 AAV-MOG cells. For calculations,
the FL4 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was used for both selected populations. The
calculation for the final values was performed by first calculating the mean of the sample
duplicate, followed by subtracting the MFI (HEK) of the MFI (AAV-MOG), resulting in the delta
MFI of the sample. Finally, each sample delta MFI was calibrated with the delta MFI of the
calibrator, therefore compensating for possible differences in test performance per day.
Controls and the second calibrator were used as additional quality controls of each assay.
Over the course of three years of performing the FACS assay the following control sample
results were observed: negative control calibrated delta MFI mean 0.16 (standard deviation
0.04; coefficient of variation=23.04%), positive control calibrated delta MFI mean 19.8
(standard deviation 3.17; coefficient of variation=15.98%) and strong positive control calibrated
delta MFI mean 54.4 (standard deviation 8.94; coefficient of variation=16.43%).
Assay Nr. 3 was validated using the same 322 serum samples from people with inflammatory
demyelinating diseases and healthy controls as assay Nr. 2. eFigure 1 and eTable 1 show the
results for the initial validation of this assay including the definition of the cut-off value and the
comparison with our original IgG(H+L) assay. From this data we determined a cut-off level of
≥5.0 calibrated delta MFI using ROC analysis.

Assay Nr. 10 (ELISA)
ELISA was performed using the commercially available ANASPEC SensoLyteR anti-Human
MOG (1-125) Specific Quantitative ELISA Kit (lots 1012 and 1013, by ANASPEC EGT group)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. All samples were analyzed in duplicates. Sera
were used at a dilution of 1:40 and the anti-human IgG-HRP (Component G) secondary
antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2000 for 45min. Absorbance (OD) was measured at 450nm.
Calculation of ng/ml was performed using a polynomal calibration curve (standard curve:
R2=0.99 in all plates assayed). Samples were determined to be positive at ≥150ng/ml as
described before 30.

2. Supplementary results
As a technical control we have also included 10 samples containing monoclonal humanized
IgG or IgM antibodies provided by center 5 in phase 1. The humanized monoclonal MOG-Ab
8-18-C5 31 (expressed as human IgG1 or IgM) was used in increasing dilutions to assess the
technical sensitivity of assays. This antibody was not recognized in assays 4, 5, 6, 9 or 11.
Detailed results are shown in efigure 2.
However, these results must be interpreted with caution since the humanized IgG1 MOG-Ab
was not recognized by some of the secondary antibodies, particularly the anti-IgG1 antibodies.
Furthermore, only dilutions, but no concentration, of the monoclonal antibodies were given and
the final dilutions varied greatly between assays.
All centers reproduced the MOG-IgG results from their samples submitted for phase I (efigure
3).
