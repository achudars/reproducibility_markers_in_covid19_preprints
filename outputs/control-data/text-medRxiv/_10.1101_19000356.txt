Key messages:
 What is already known about the subject?
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in juvenile-onset systemic
lupus erythematosus (JSLE) not attributable to lupus flares; the cardiovascular risk
of JSLE patients is 300 times higher than age matched healthy individuals. It is not
possible to predict those patients at greatest risk using traditional risk factors.
 What does this study add?
In depth lipoprotein-based metabolomic analysis identified Apolipoprotein(Apo)B
:ApoA1 ratio as a potential biomarker for predicting increased cardiovascular risk in
JSLE. This was validated in a second patient cohort and using metabolic signatures
associated with pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque development in adult SLE
patients.
 How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?
Predicting cardiovascular risk in young JSLE patients using ApoB:ApoA1 ratio could
help to stratify patients and identify those who would benefit the most from existing
lipid targeting therapies. Reducing cardiovascular risk at a young age could improve
patient’s life expectancy and quality of life and reduce cardiovascular comorbidity in
later life.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune disorder
characterised by immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation and increased
cardiovascular risk (CVR). Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality
in JSLE patients not attributable to disease flares. However, it is not possible to
predict those patients at greatest risk using traditional CVR factors.
METHODS
Serum metabolomic analysis was performed using a nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy-platform in 31 JSLE patients. Data was analysed using cluster, linear
regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results were validated in
a second cohort of 31 JSLE patients and using data from a cohort of adult-onset
SLE patients with known pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque.
RESULTS
Unbiased hierarchical clustering of metabolomic data identified three patient groups.
Group-1 had decreased atheroprotective high density lipoproteins (HDL) and
increased atherogenic very low and low density lipoproteins (VLDL/LDL); Group-2
had elevated HDL but reduced VLDL/LDL; and Group-3 had low HDL/VLDL/LDL
levels. Notably, apolipoprotein(Apo)B1:ApoA1 ratio, a known CVR marker in adult
cohorts, was elevated in Group-1 JSLE patients compared to Groups-2/3. The
metabolomic signature was validated in a second JSLE cohort and compared with
lipid biomarkers previously associated with pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque in
adult SLE patients. Linear regression analysis accounting for demographics,
treatment, disease activity, lupus serological markers and body mass index
confirmed that a unique metabolomic profile could differentiate between JSLE
patients at high and low CVR.

INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder
characterised by loss of immune cell regulation, chronic inflammation and multiple
organ damage. Juvenile-onset disease (JSLE) (onset before 18 years) is seen in up
to 20% of patients and is more severe compared to adult-onset SLE[1, 2]. Mortality
from SLE has improved dramatically over the last 50 years due mainly to improved
treatment[3]. However, while deaths attributable to active lupus are reduced, deaths
associated with comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD) are higher[4,
5]. Cardiovascular risk (CVR) and mortality are particularly increased in JSLE and it is
proposed that all patients with SLE, irrespective of age at disease onset, should
receive aggressive monitoring and treatment of modifiable CVR factors[6]. Currently,
there are no guidelines for CVR monitoring or management in SLE/JSLE, thus there is
an urgent need to find better ways to stratify patients based on their CVR and identify
adequate therapeutic approaches to decrease the overall CV morbidity and mortality
associated with SLE.
Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammation of the large arteries associated with defects
in lipid homeostasis, is a major cause of CVD. In patients with JSLE the
atherosclerotic process begins in childhood and is accelerated in part due to
prolonged exposure to inflammation[7]. Dyslipidaemia, a conventional risk factor for
CVD, is a common feature of patients with both adult and JSLE, and includes
elevated triglycerides (TG) and low density lipoprotein (LDL), and depressed highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein-A1 (ApoA1)[8-11]. However, beyond
these findings, very little information is available to assess whether defects in lipid
metabolism are present in JSLE.
Interplay between traditional CVR factors (including dyslipidaemia) and risk factors
associated with continuing SLE disease could contribute to development of early

atherosclerosis in JSLE patients[12]. This raises the possibility that drugs targeting
lipid metabolism could be beneficial in patients with JSLE. Cholesterol lowering
drugs (such as statins) have been trialled in SLE patients but with mixed outcomes.
Some studies show beneficial effects including improved lipid and inflammatory
cytokine levels, reduced vascular inflammation, mortality and morbidity in SLE
patients[13-15]. However, in two major randomised control trials, the Lupus
Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (LAPS)[16] in adults and the Atherosclerosis
Prevention in Paediatric Lupus Erythematosus (APPLE) trial in children[17], statins
failed to meet their primary outcomes. We hypothesised that patient heterogeneity
could contribute to these disappointing results and that the success of future trials
could depend on the correct stratification of patients before inclusion into such
studies[18, 19].
Here, in depth lipoprotein-based metabolomics was used to better characterise
dyslipdaemia in patients with JSLE. Two distinct patient groups were defined and
validated based on their lipoprotein profiles: Group-1 had higher levels of very low
density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL
(associated with high CVD risk), and Group-2 had higher HDL (associated with low
CVD risk)[20]. Importantly, elevated apolipoprotein-(Apo)B:ApoA1 ratio was
identified as a potential predictive biomarker associated with atherogenesis, this was
independent of other factors including disease activity, treatment and body mass
index (BMI). Collectively, these findings could help identify JSLE patients at greatest
CVR and pinpoint those patients who would most benefit from targeted lipid
modifying therapies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Peripheral blood was collected from JSLE patients fulfilling The American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for lupus (1997)[21] or the Systemic
Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria (2012)[22], attending a
young adult or adolescent rheumatology clinic at University College London Hospital
(UCLH). Two cohorts were collected: a discovery cohort (n=31) and a validation
cohort (n=31). Detailed patient and disease characteristics (including demographics,
disease duration, clinical manifestations and medication) were recorded from
medical records and through questionnaires (Table 1). Disease activity was
calculated using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). A score of 6 or more was
used to indicate active disease[23]. Written, informed consent was acquired from all
patients under the ethical approval (REC11/LO/0330). All information was stored as
anonymised data. Patients treated with rituximab within the past year were excluded
from the study due to previously reported substantial improvements in CVR
measures following effective treatment[24].

Patient and public involvement
Patients were not involved with the design of the study. However, using online
surveys[25] and face-to-face events[26] patients have been consulted about their
experience of CVR counselling and management, the acceptability of

potential

therapeutic interventions and the design of future clinical trials.

Metabolomics
Serum metabolomics analysis was performed using nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy by Nightingale Health (https://nightingalehealth.com/)[27]
(Supplementary Table 1 for list of metabolites).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism-7. Data was tested for
normal distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and parametric/non-parametric
tests were used accordingly. Unpaired and paired t-tests and One-way ANOVA
were used as appropriate. Linear regression was performed using a 95% confidence
interval to calculate significance (Pearson correlation). Multiple testing was
accounted for using the Holm-Sidak correction of p-values. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism-7.
MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) was used to produce heat maps and hierarchical
clustering (Pearson correlation) using z-score transformed raw data values
calculated in Microsoft Excel 2010 using the equation: ((Individual Value-Population
Mean)/(Population Standard Deviation–Square Root of the Total Sample Number)).
ClustVis web-tool[28] was used to perform principle component analysis.
Logistic regression was performed in RStudio[29] on each metabolomic biomarker
and adjusted for demographic, clinical and treatment parameters. Results were
visualised using the R package foresplotNMR[30].

RESULTS
Stratification of JSLE patients using detailed lipoprotein profiles identified
three unique patient groups
Dyslipidaemia was investigated in patients with JSLE using an in-depth
metabolomics platform (Discovery cohort, Table-1, and Supplementary Table 1 for
metabolite list). Lipoprotein measures were converted to z-scores and unbiased
hierarchical clustering was performed (Figure 1A). Despite routine clinical serum
lipid measures being largely within normal ranges (Table-1), three distinct clusters
based on lipoprotein particle concentrations and diameters were identified: Group-1
characterised by reduced serum HDL and elevated VLDL/IDL/LDL particles; Group2 with elevated HDL and reduced VLDL/IDL/LDL particles and; Group-3 had
relatively low serum levels of HDL and VLDL/LDL/IDL particles (Figure 1A and B)
Beyond lipoproteins, other lipid metabolites showed a distinct pattern of distribution
within the three clusters (Figure 1C). Patients in Group-1 (high VLDL/IDL/LDL) were
characterised by increased levels of total, free and esterified VLDL/IDL/LDLassociated cholesterol, free and lipoprotein-associated TG levels, choline related
lipids (phosphoglycerides (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelins (SM))
and polyunsaturated, omega and saturated fatty acids (FA) whereas HDL
cholesterol and unsaturated FAs were reduced compared to the overall cohort
average. The opposite was found in Groups-2 and 3 where VLDL/IDL/LDLassociated cholesterol and TG levels were lower in all cases. Groups-2 and 3 had a
similar metabolomic profile except that JSLE patients in Group-3 had additionally
lower HDL levels (Figure 1B). Thus, three distinct JSLE patient groups could be
stratified based on their metabolomic lipoprotein profile alone.

JSLE patients in the three metabolic groups had a similar clinical profile but
were associated with an altered CVR

Strikingly, the clinical and disease features of JSLE patients in each of the three
metabolic groups were similar (Supplementary Table 2). There were no significant
differences in disease activity score (SLEDAI), age of onset, disease duration or
treatment. Patients in Group-1 had significantly reduced complement C3 compared
to patients in Group-3. Notably, although almost all patients had total cholesterol
and TG levels within normal ranges, patients in Group-1 had reduced HDL
cholesterol and elevated LDL cholesterol compared to Groups-2 and -3
(Supplementary Table 2).

Recent studies show that the ratio between serum ApoB:ApoA1 is a more effective
CVR predictor than routine cholesterol measurements; a higher ratio is associated
with increased risk[31, 32]. JSLE patients in Group-1 had a significantly elevated
ApoB:ApoA1 ratio compared to Groups-2 and 3 (Figure 1D); this was higher than
the mean value from age matched adolescent healthy donors. In support of this
finding, other measures associated with increased CVR were also altered between
the three groups; patients in Group-1 had a significant increase in atherogenic index
of plasma (Log(Triglycerides/HDL-Cholesterol)[33]) compared to Groups-2 and 3
(Figure 1E) and BMI was significantly higher in patients in Group-3 compared to
Group-2 (Figure 1F).

Metabolomic stratification was validated and associated with markers of preclinical atherosclerotic plaque
The robustness of this metabolomic stratification was tested in a second cohort of
31 JSLE patients, recruited with no selection bias other than no rituximab treatment
in the previous year (Validation cohort, Table 1). Using the same lipoprotein markers
and unbiased hierarchical clustering method, patients clustered into 2 groups
(Figure 2A). These 2 groups (labelled Group-1A and 2A) reflected the lipoprotein
phenotype observed in Groups-1 and 2 in the discovery cohort (Figure 1A). Group-3

seen in the discovery cohort was not validated. Importantly, measures associated
with CVR in the general population were significantly increased in JSLE Group-1A
including the ApoB:ApoA1 ratio, atherogenic index of plasma and BMI compared to
Group-2A (Figure 2B-D). As in the discovery cohort, no major clinical parameters
discriminated between Groups-1A and 2A (Supplemental Table 3).
In order to confirm that JSLE patients in Groups-1/1A had an atherogenic lipid
profile, a comparison was made with metabolites previously identified to be
associated with pre-clinical carotid and femoral artery atherosclerotic plaque in
adult-onset SLE patients[34]. Lipid biomarkers identified in adult SLE patients with
pre-clinical plaque - elevated ratios of triglycerides:phosphoglycerides and
monounsaturated:total fatty acids, elevated glycoprotein acetyl levels and reduced
ratios of omega-6:total fatty acids - were also significantly altered in Group-1/1A
JSLE patients compared to Groups-2/2A and 3 (Figure 2E). Furthermore, these
plaque-associated metabolites correlated significantly with the ApoB:ApoA1 ratio in
patients from Group1+1A only (Figure 2F).
Together, these results suggested that metabolomic analysis could stratify JSLE
patients according to their CVR.

ApoB:ApoA1 ratio could be an independent biomarker associated with
increased CVR in patients with JSLE
In order to further assess the utility of specific biomarkers in predicting CVR in JSLE
patients, logistic regression analysis was performed on the data comparing Groups1+1A with Groups-2+2A; data was normalised for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, disease
duration, disease activity, double-stranded DNA autoantibodies, C-reactive protein,
complement-C3, lymphocyte count and treatment (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure
1, Supplementary Data Table 1). ApoB:ApoA1 ratio was confirmed as a biomarker
of CVR independent from disease and demographic features. In addition, a number
of other lipid metabolites were identified including VLDL, IDL and LDL lipid content

and monounsaturated fatty acids associated with the high CVR group whereas HDL
lipid content and unsaturated fatty acids were associated with low CVR group
(Figure 3). Interestingly Glycoprotein Acetyl, related with increased cardiovascular
mortality risk [35, 36], was the only non-lipid metabolite differentially expressed
between the groups (Supplementary Figure 1). In order to further assess the power
of the identified biomarkers, stringent p value correction for multiple testing was
applied to the logistic regression data; 11 metabolites were differentially associated
with potential high and low CVR in JSLE (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table 4). This
included increased ApoB:ApoA1 ratio and concentration of small VLDL cholesterol
esters (VLDL-CE) associated with high CVR and reduced large HDL particle
concentration, lipid content and diameter associated with low CVR. Notably, the
majority of these metabolites (Figure 4A) can be significantly affected by statins[37,
38], pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors[39], dietary fish
consumption

and/or BMI[40]. Principle component analysis using the top 11

differentially expressed metabolites between Group1+1A and Group2+2A confirmed
independent clustering of the 2 groups (Figure 4B).
Finally, a ROC curve analysis of the 11 differentially expressed metabolites
confirmed that ApoB:ApoA1 ratio had a highly significant predictive capacity to
distinguish patients in the high CVR Groups-1+1A from patients in low CVR Groups2+2A (area under the curve=0.99, p<0.0001) (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure
2A). From this analysis a highly sensitive and specific cut-off ApoB:ApoA1 ratio of
0.45 was established to enable these groups to be distinguished from one another
(Figure 4D). Importantly, routine clinical measures of lipids were less effective at
distinguishing between the groups (Supplementary Figure 2B). Longitudinal analysis
of ApoB:ApoA1 ratios from repeat patient visits (3 month intervals) over a 12 month
period showed that the ApoB:ApoA1 ratio biomarker remained stable over time
(Figure 4E) despite individual patient fluctuations in disease activity scores
(Supplementary Figure 3).

Therefore, the results suggest that ApoB:ApoA1 ratio is a robust biomarker that
could be used to predict increased CVR in patients with JSLE. These high risk
patients could not be confidently distinguished using routine clinical assessment or
standard lipid measures. Lipid modification therapies and/or diet could be beneficial
to modify CVR in patients with a high ApoB:ApoA1 ratio (Figure 5).

Discussion
JSLE patients have an increased risk of developing CVD. Despite this knowledge,
CVD is still the leading comorbidity for patients[2, 5]. This study used detailed serum
metabolomics to stratify patients with JSLE into two validated groups, those with
high and low CVR, based on lipoprotein particle concentrations and diameters and
apolipoprotein concentrations. CVR was validated through the measurement of
metabolomic markers associated with pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque in adult
SLE patients[34]. ApoB:ApoA1 was found to be a reliably predictive biomarker of
CVR in JSLE irrespective of demographic features (including BMI) and
disease/treatment measures. This information strongly suggests that a group of
JSLE patients with a potential increased CVR could benefit from tailored lipid
modifying therapy and/or diet intervention and that stratification based on more
detailed lipoprotein taxonomy should be included in future clinical trials.
Prediction of cardiovascular disease in the general population predominantly relies
on relatively simple measurements such as serum total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and
triglycerides[20]. However over recent years is has become apparent that more indepth lipoprotein assessment including lipoprotein subclasses and their lipid
concentrations and composition can provide new insight into CVR prediction and
understanding of disease mechanisms[36, 41]. Using this approach could be
particularly relevant for assessing CVR in patients with chronic inflammatory
conditions such as JSLE, which is difficult to assess in the absence of traditional risk
factors[3]. Dyslipidaemia (assessed using routine clinical measures) is reported in
JSLE, however it is difficult to differentiate the effect of disease activity and
treatment on lipid profiles from conventional CVR lipid profiles[9-11].
To our knowledge, no studies have used detailed lipoprotein profiles to stratify JSLE
patients to assess their CVR. Using this method we characterised ApoB:ApoA1 ratio

as a potential biomarker for increased CVR in JSLE patients. This finding supports
findings in the Cardiovascular Risk in the Young Finns Study showing that elevated
ApoB and ApoB:ApoA1 ratio and reduced ApoA1 in children and adolescents
reflected a predisposition to subclinical atherosclerosis in adulthood in healthy
individuals[42] and previous reports showing that ApoB:A1 ratio has improved CVR
predictive value compared to conventional blood cholesterol measures[31, 32].
Reduced ApoA1 and reduced HDL concentration have been reported previously in
JSLE patients compared with healthy donors[43] and increased Apo‐B was
associated with arterial stiffness in adult SLE patients[44].
A cut-off value for ApoB:ApoA1 ratio of 0.45 was identified that could have clinical
utility. Comparison to other published work showed that ApoB:ApoA1 ratio is age
dependant so further validation of age specific cut points is needed. For example, a
study of healthy and overweight adults (mean age 56 years) reported an
ApoB:ApoA1

ratio

of

0.80

as

predictive

of

coronary

heart

disease

in

overweight/obese people, and that this performed better than other traditional
clinical measures[36]. Alternatively, a Swedish study defined a cut-off of 0.63 for
femoral artery atherosclerosis prediction in women (mean age 64-years)[45].
Another study, including young healthy females identified ApoB:A1 ratios from 0.55
at age 10-years to 0.58 at age 19-years [46]. Differences in published ratios could
also be accounted for by different technologies used to assess ApoB and ApoA1
levels (mainly colorimetric methodology compared to the NMR technology used
here) and the fasting status of the study participants (fasting versus non-fasting); our
study was performed on non-fasting patients.
Not all patients with JSLE have the same CVR; therefore identifying low and high
CVR groups in clinic could be pivotal for the success of interventions to reduce this
risk. A 3-year clinical trial of atorvastatin in patients with JSLE aged 10-21 (the
APPLE trial) did not meet its primary outcome of reduced progression of subclinical

atherosclerosis, despite atorvastatin-treated participants showing a trend towards
slower carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) progression[17]. However, the authors
suggested that certain subgroups of JSLE patients would benefit from targeted
statin therapy, although the routine serum lipid level measurements did not facilitate
patient stratification. This study showed that subclinical atherosclerosis in SLE
begins in the paediatric age group and highlighted the need for paediatric
rheumatologists to address modifiable CVR factors in daily practice. Other patient
groups responding well to treatment with statins, as assessed by HDL and LDL-C
levels, have been shown to have high ApoB[47, 48]; thus apolipoprotein measures
could help optimise the efficacy of lipid modifying therapy by targeting the correct
patients. In addition to statins other interventions could also be relevant including
PCSK9 inhibitor[49] and nutritional intervention through increased dietary intake of
omega-3 FAs[50, 51]. The efficacy of personalised nutritional therapy has been
validated recently in patients with diabetes; high variability between post-meal
glucose levels in patients was used to stratify patients for specific short-term
personalised dietary interventions to manage glucose levels[52]. Dietary intervention
has been shown to reduce disease activity scores in SLE patients[50, 53] and
patients are very engaged with such strategies[25].
It will be important to validate this work in a larger multi-centre study to account for
genetic, environmental and dietary differences, although this cohort was ethnically
diverse. Future research will address both clinical validation (including endothelial
dysfunction studies and measurement of plaque and intimal-media thickness) as
well as potential therapeutic interventions.
In conclusion, there are no guidelines for CVR monitoring or management in patients
with SLE/JSLE, thus there is an urgent need to find better ways to stratify these
patients based on their CVR and identify adequate therapeutic approaches to
decrease the overall CV morbidity and mortality associated with SLE. This study

Figure 4: ApoB:ApoA1 as a clinical biomarker of CVR in JSLE
(A) Forest plot from linear regression analysis displaying the odds ratio and 95% CI
of 11 metabolites that passed p value correction for multiple testing between
Group1+1A (n=30) and Group2+2A (n=26). Data was normalised for clinical
parameters, demographic information, treatment and BMI. Corrected p-values
(Holm-Sidak) are displayed for each metabolite. Stars represent metabolites that are
significantly affected by BMI (Black), statins (Red)[37-39], PCSK9 inhibitors
(Blue)[39] and habitual dietary fish consumption (Green)[40]. (B) Principle
component analysis using the 11 significant metabolites between Group1+1A (n=30,
red) and Group2+2A (n=26, blue) identified in (A). C) ROC curve analysis of the
ApoB:ApoA1 ratio of patients in Group-1+1A (n=30) compared to patients in Group2+2A (n=26). Area under the curve (AUC) is displayed. D) ApoB:ApoA1 ratio (higher
ratios=higher risk) measured in Group-1+1A (n=30) and Group-2+2A (n=26). Cut-off
identified from the ROC analysis is displayed as the blue dashed line. Mean,
