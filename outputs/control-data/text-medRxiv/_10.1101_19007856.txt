ABSTRACT

18

The geographical accessibility to health facilities is conditioned by the topography and

19

environmental conditions overlapped with different transport facilities between rural and urban

20

areas. To better estimate the travel time to the most proximate health facility infrastructure and

21

determine the differences across heterogeneous land coverage types, this study explored the use

22

of a novel cloud-based geospatial modeling approach and use as a case study the unique

23

geographical and ecological diversity in the Peruvian territory. Geospatial data of 145,134 cities

24

and villages and 8,067 health facilities in Peru were gathered with land coverage types, roads

25

infrastructure, navigable river networks, and digital elevation data to produce high-resolution (30

26

m) estimates of travel time to the most proximate health facility across the country. This study

27

estimated important variations in travel time between urban and rural settings across the 16

28

major land coverage types in Peru, that in turn, overlaps with socio-economic profiles of the

29

villages. The median travel time to primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities was 1.9,

30

2.3, and 2.2 folds higher in rural than urban settings, respectively. Also, higher travel time values

31

were observed in areas with a high proportion of the population with unsatisfied basic needs. In

32

so doing, this study provides a new methodology to estimate travel time to health facilities as a

33

tool to enhance the understanding and characterization of the profiles of accessibility to health

34

facilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), calling for a service delivery redesign to

35

maximize high quality of care.

1. INTRODUCTION

37

Despite growing consensus to combat inequalities in the accessibility to healthcare around the

38

world, large disparities in healthcare accessibility remain as a problem in countries with an

39

ongoing rural-to-urban transition. According to the ‘Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2017

40

Global Monitoring Report’, half of the worldwide population lacks essential health services

41

(World Health Organization & World Bank, 2017). To overcome the disadvantage of

42

marginalized populations, the international community through the United Nations (UN) have

43

stated 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targeted by 2030 (UN General Assembly,

44

2015). From these goals, the interface between goal 3, — ‘Good health and well-being’,; and

45

goal 10, — ‘Reduced inequalities’, play an important role to foster and couple endeavors towards

46

ensured access to healthcare services.

47

The broad term ‘accessibility’, when referring to healthcare, focuses on multiple domains such as

48

the provision of healthcare facilities, supply chain, quality and effective services, human

49

resources, and on the demand side, health-seeking behaviors (Agbenyo, Marshall Nunbogu, &

50

Dongzagla, 2017; Peters et al., 2008). All these characteristics pointed to the ability of a

51

population to receive appropriate, affordable and quality medical care when needed (Kanuganti,

52

Sarkar, Singh, & Arkatkar, 2015). Importantly, in rural and high poverty areas the most common

53

reasons that prevents the access to healthcare are the geographical accessibility, availability of

54

the right type of care, financial accessibility, and acceptability of service (Al-Taiar, Clark,

55

Longenecker, & Whitty, 2010; Peters et al., 2008). This study focuses on the travel time to health

56

facilities as an important component of the geographical (or physical) accessibility to healthcare.

57

Several studies in developing countries report that geographical accessibility is the main factor

58

that prevents the use of primary healthcare (Al-Taiar et al., 2010; Kanuganti et al., 2015; Müller,

59

Smith, Mellor, Rare, & Genton, 1998; Noor, Zurovac, Hay, Ochola, & Snow, 2003; Perry &

60

Gesler, 2000; Stock, 1983), and not only conditions the ability of the population for health

61

seeking, but also the capacity of the health system to implement prevention and control strategies

62

with adequate coverage. However, fewer studies have explored the heterogeneity in geographical

63

accessibility across areas with contrasting land coverage (Bashshur, Shannon, & Metzner, 1971;

64

Comber, Brunsdon, & Radburn, 2011), i.e. the marked variation in the topography and

65

environment conditions overlapped with different transport facilities between rural and urban

66

areas that may influence the geographical accessibility across these areas. The geographical

67

accessibility to health services has a direct impact on health outcomes since determine the timely

68

response to patients that seek care, community-based campaigns (i.e. vaccination, iron

69

supplements to combat anemia, etc.), or deliver first response to accidents or natural disasters.

70

Previous studies highlighted the importance of geographical or physical accessibility using a

71

variety of methods (Comber et al., 2011; Delamater, Messina, Shortridge, & Grady, 2012;

72

Huerta Munoz & Källestål, 2012; Ouko, Gachari, Sichangi, & Alegana, s. f.). The emergence of

73

‘Precision Public Health’ driven by estimates of a wide range of health indicators at a high

74

spatial resolution is defined as the use of the best available data to target more effectively and

75

efficiently interventions of all kinds to those most in need (Chowkwanyun, Bayer, & Galea,

76

2018; Dowell, Blazes, & Desmond-Hellmann, 2016; Horton, 2018; Tatem, 2018). This approach

77

may be favorable since traditionally government's reports aggregates data at administrative units,

78

in a way that obscure the prioritization of resources. A recent study used a precision public

79

health approach to estimate the geographical accessibility to major cities (Weiss et al., 2018),

80

however, this approach has not yet been used for estimating the geographical accessibility to

81

health facilities in developing countries.

82

This study sought to estimate the travel time to the most proximate health facility in rural and

83

urban areas across heterogeneous land coverage types in Peru as a means to help resources

84

prioritization, disease surveillance, as well as prevention and control strategies. Multiple sources

85

of geospatial data were fitted with a novel cloud-based geospatial modeling approach (Weiss

86

et al., 2018) to produce high-resolution (30 m) estimates of travel time to the most proximate

87

health facility across the country. These estimates were then compared between urban and rural

88

settings and across 16 major land coverage types in Peru.

travel time) in a two-step process. First, a friction surface was computed. Several geospatial

94

datasets (land coverage types, boundaries of restricted areas, roads infrastructure, navigable river

95

networks, and topography) were used to construct a surface (i.e. raster or grid) of a given spatial

96

resolution (i.e. 30m per pixel) where the value of each pixel (or cell) contains the time required

97

to travel one meter in that given area. Secondly, this friction surface and the geolocation of the

98

health facilities were used to infer the travel time to the the most proximate (lowest time) health

99

facility using a cumulative cost function. As a result, the travel time estimate for the most

100

proximate health facility was computed for the entire country. The computed values were then

101

summarized in a 500m-radius from the geolocation of cities and villages; per district, province or

102

department; by urban/rural areas; and across 16 major land coverage types defined by the

103

Ministry of Environment (MEnv).

104

2.2. Study area

105

This study was conducted using nationwide data from Peru, located on the Pacific coast of South

106

America. Peru encompasses an area of 1,285,216 Km2 and 32,162,184 inhabitants divided in 25

107

departments and 1,722 districts. Major ecological areas in the country are divided into the coast,

108

highlands, and jungle (Figure 1A), however this study explore a higher granularity of ecological

109

areas with more than 60 unique land coverage areas (Supplementary Information 1) that were

110

officially classified in Peru. This classification was based on ecological, topographic, and climate

111

characteristics, that in turn are important for the calculation of travel time since each category

112

requires a different displacement effort.

113

2.3. Data Sources

114

The datasets were divided according to its use in the construction of the friction surface and the

115

travel time map.

116

a) Friction surface construction

117

The land coverage types were derived from satellite images from MODIS MCD12Q1 product

118

(Friedl et al., 2010). The MODIS collection includes seventeen land coverage types including

119

urban and rural areas inferred by the spectral signature of the satellite images. The boundaries of

120

the national protected natural areas were included using data provided by the MEnv. The road

121

infrastructure in all districts was provided by the Peruvian Ministry of Transportation (MTrans),

122

and the navigable river network was derived from the HydroSHEDS Flow Accumulation dataset

123

(Lehner, Verdin, & Jarvis, 2006). The estimates of the friction surface (minutes required to travel

124

one meter) were adjusted by the slope of the terrain. This means that, the travel time required to

125

cross an area will be proportionally dependent to the slope of the terrain. The slope for each area

126

was calculated using the SRTM Digital Elevation Data (Jarvis, Reuter, Nelson, & Guevara,

127

2008) produced by NASA.

128

b) Travel time estimation

129

The target locations used for the cumulative cost function were the health facilities (clinics) of

130

the Ministry of Health (MH). This data was obtained from the geo-localization registry of health

131

facilities (RENAES in spanish) (Figure 1B). The MH organize the health facilities in three

132

categories according to the complexity of services they provide (from primary healthcare to

133

specialized hospitals). The primary level includes basic health facilities with no laboratory, the

134

secondary level includes health facilities with laboratory, and tertiary level includes hospitals and

135

higher complexity services. Finally, travel time estimates were extracted for each city and village

136

(Figure 1C). The most updated geo-localization of villages was provided by the Ministry of

137

Education (MEd) in a recent census of cities and villages, and education facilities.

138

2.4. Data Analysis

139

a) Friction surface construction

140

The estimation of travel time were conducted in Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al.,

141

2017). A surface grid was constructed using the information about land coverage, road

142

infrastructure, and river network. All datasets were converted into aligned grids with a 30-meter

143

resolution. Each dataset contained the information of the speed of movement in each feature. All

144

the layers were then combined with the fastest mode of movement taking precedence (Km h-1).

145

The speed assigned for each category of land cover were obtained from elsewhere (Weiss et al.,

146

2018). A data transformation was conducted, so each pixel within the 2D grid contained the cost

147

(time) to moving through the area encompassed in the pixel, herein referred to as ‘friction

148

surface’. Slope adjustment was carried out using the Tobler’s Hiking Function (Tobler, 1993)

149

and the speed was penalized (reduced) in urban and national protected areas to account for

150

vehicular traffic and restricted displacement, respectively.

151

b) Travel time estimation

152

To calculate the travel time from the villages to the most proximate health facility, the

153

cumulative cost function was used in GEE to generate the accessibility map. The cumulative cost

154

function is a least-cost-path algorithm, briefly, all possible paths were analyzed iteratively and

155

the weighted cost (in this case, weighted by time) was then minimized. The minimum travel time

156

to the most proximate health facility was computed for each pixel in the grid, then the median

157

travel time was summarized in a 500m-radius from the geolocation of each city or village

158

(Supplementary Information 2). Values between the 5% and 95% percentile range were

159

considered to avoid extreme values. Since a health facility could be located in the 30m2

160

corresponding to the pixel spatial resolution of the estimates, a baseline 10-minutes travel time

161

was considered. The analysis was carried out for each health facility category. After GEE

162

processing, all data outputs were imported and analyzed using R v.3.6.0 (R Development Core

163

Team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Australia).

164

The computed travel time was then summarized per district, province or department; by

165

urban/rural areas; and across 16 major land coverage types defined by the MEnv. Urban/rural

166

status was defined based on the MODIS land coverage satellite images (described previously in

167

2.3 Data Sources). To better detail the large diversity of land coverage types in Peru, a shortlist

168

of 16 eco-regions provided by the MEnv (Supplementary Information 1) was used to

169

summarize the travel time in these areas. In addition, the distribution of travel time relative to the

170

proportion of population with unsatisfied basic needs (UBN) ─ a multidimensional poverty

171

measurement developed by the United Nation’s Economic Commission for Latin America and

172

the Caribbean (ECLAC) ─ per department was computed with data provided by the Ministry of

173

Economy (MEco).

176

For this study, we gathered geo-referenced data on 145,134 villages (Figure 1B) and 8,067

177

health facilities (Figure 1C) across the 1,722 districts in the Peruvian territory. The health

178

facility density (number of health facilities divided by the total population) in Peru was 2.58 per

179

10,000 inhabitants with variations between major ecological areas, from 1.35 in the coast, 4.56 in

180

the highlands, to 5.21 in the jungle.

181

Friction and travel time maps were reconstructed in Google Earth Engine using the described

182

local datasets at a spatial resolution of 30 meters per pixel (Supplementary Information 2).

183

Country-wide median travel time from each village to the most proximate health facility varies

184

according to category: primary healthcare = 39 minutes (IQR=20 – 93), secondary healthcare =

185

152 minutes (IQR=75 – 251), and tertiary healthcare = 448 minutes (IQR=302 – 631).

186

Importantly, maximum travel time reached 7,819, 12,429, and 35,753 minutes for primary,

187

secondary, and tertiary levels, respectively (Figure 2).

188

Urban/rural and ecological settings

189

High heterogeneity was observed in contrasting land coverage areas. The median travel time was

190

5.3 fold higher in rural (85 minutes; IQR=11–7,819) than in urban settings (16 minutes; IQR =

191

11–835) to a primary healthcare facility; 3.2 fold higher in rural (226 minutes; IQR = 11–12,429)

192

than in urban settings (70 minutes; IQR = 11–3,386) to a secondary healthcare facility; and 2.4

193

fold higher in rural (568 minutes; IQR = 11–35,753) than in urban settings (235 minutes; IQR =

194

11–10,048) to a tertiary healthcare facility. A larger variation in travel time to primary healthcare

195

was observed in rural compared to urban areas, and conversely, a larger variation in travel time

196

to tertiary healthcare was observed in urban compared to rural areas (Figure 3). The district-

197

level stratified averages in Figure 2 show that there were also strong heterogeneities within

198

major ecological regions. The north-east part of the Amazon Region, which borders with

199

Colombia and Brazil, presented the largest country-wide travel times to the most proximate

200

health facilities. The largest travel times to the most proximate health facilities within the

201

Highlands Region was observed in the southern areas of the Andes, and in the coast was

202

observed in the southern coast. Contrasting distributions of travel time to the most proximate

203

health facility was observed between the 16 eco-regions defined by the MEnv (Figure 3).

Travel time to health facilities relative to UBN

205

When the travel time to most proximate health facilities was distributed relative to the proportion

206

of the population with unsatisfied basic needs at department level (administrative level 1), a

207

positive trend was observed (Figure 4). The slope of this relation was increased in geographical

208

accessibility to tertiary health facilities in comparison to primary or secondary health facilities.

209

4. DISCUSSION

210

The present study explored the use of novel cloud-based geospatial modeling approach fitted

211

with detailed local geospatial data to accurately estimate the travel time to the most proximate

212

health facility across a highly diverse geographical and ecological settings as observed in Peru.

213

This study showed the first quantification of heterogeneities in travel time to the most proximate

214

health facility as a surrogate of geographical accessibility in the Latin American region. Most of

215

the differences in travel time arose from heterogeneous land coverage profiles and the contrast

216

between urban and rural areas. This is particularly important due to the fact that in Peru and in

217

most LMIC, the most detailed data is available at a coarse administrative level that deter the

218

resource planning and healthcare provision in these countries. Another direct implication of the

219

utility of this approach is providing yet another angle of disadvantages amongst the most

220

underserved, now in terms of access to healthcare as measured by distance and time, one of

221

multiple aspects of high-quality healthcare.

222

In settings with a scattered distribution of villages, timely access to health facilities is a

223

cornerstone to improve the health status of impoverished populations and a first step to provide

224

high quality care (Kruk et al., 2018; Kruk, Pate, & Mullan, 2017). Although the use of big data

225

and high-detail datasets paves the way for a comprehensive quantification of geographical

226

accessibility in terms of distance and travel time, these technologies were not previously applied

227

to estimate geographical accessibility to health facilities until recently (Tatem, 2018). Using this

228

analytical approach, this study demonstrated that the population in the Jungle area have less

229

accessibility since healthcare services are reachable at longer trajectories and travel time,

230

understood as less geographical accessibility. The dramatic heterogeneity in travel time to the

231

most proximate health facility observed in this study corresponds to the contrasting landscape

232

composition in the coast, highlands, and jungle regions. A dense road network was observed in

233

the Coast, facilitating access to multiple services including healthcare as reported in other studies

234

in India and Africa (Kanuganti et al., 2015; Strano, Viana, Sorichetta, & Tatem, 2018).

235

Conversely, sparse road coverage was observed in the Highlands and only the two major cities in

236

the Jungle region had roads.

237

Consistently with previous studies (Bashshur et al., 1971; Comber et al., 2011), this study

238

determined the heterogeneity in travel time to the most proximate health facility across areas

239

with contrasting land coverage types. Despite that this fact is widely accepted, few attempts have

240

been made to quantify these heterogeneities. In addition, asymmetries were identified when the

241

travel time to the most proximate health facility was compared along socio-economic profiles

242

based on the unsatisfied basic needs index proposed by the United Nations Development

243

Programme (UNDP). Uneven trends of greater travel time to health facilities (lower geographical

244

accessibility) were observed among villages with higher rates of unmet basic needs. These

245

results are consistent with previous reports of negative trends in geographical access to

246

healthcare facilities in low-income populations (Kiwanuka et al., 2008; Meyer, Luong,

247

Mamerow, & Ward, 2013; Peters et al., 2008; Tanser, Gijsbertsen, & Herbst, 2006).

248

It is important to highlight that the analysis conducted in this study did not take into account

249

variability due to climatic factors that may prevent displacement to health facilities (i.e. floods or

250

landslides). However, Highlands and Jungle areas are more prone to this kind of natural disaster,

251

leading to a conservative estimation of travel time in these areas. Traffic, which may greatly

252

influence the estimates in the large cities, was not considered in the analysis and potentially

253

cause an underestimation of the travel time to health facilities. In addition, seasonal variability

254

may greatly affect some displacement routes such as rivers; however, only navigable rivers were

255

considered in this approach and the availability to displace through this rivers are less affected by

256

seasonality. Another important consideration about the least-cost-path algorithm used in this

257

analysis is that we infer the lowest travel time boundary to reach a health facility. This

258

consideration relies on the assumption that the villagers opt for this route despite the cost and

259

danger of the route in addition to its availability, as explained above.

260

In addition, the data reported here was generated at a meso-scale, with a spatial resolution of 30

261

meters. At this scale and resolution, some important details could be lost and affect the travel

262

time estimations. For instance, in some settings the travel time might be increased due to

263

meandering rivers or roads that follow the morphology of the terrain. The model assumes that

264

transit flows in a direct manner, meaning that zigzagging routes may cause our approach

265

underestimate the real travel time to reach a health facility. Despite these possible shortcomings,

266

the proposed approach provided conservative yet useful estimates of travel times to health

267

facilities that are important for planning of prevention and control strategies for multiple health-

268

related events. This approach demonstrates that curation and alignment of geospatial data from

269

multiple governmental institutions are important for national decision-making. In addition, the

270

use of mapping and modeling techniques, and ‘big data’ were recognized as critical for better

271

planning (Buckee et al., 2018; Hay, George, Moyes, & Brownstein, 2013; Tatem, 2018);

272

however, a remaining challenge is the implementation of these approaches into routine disease

273

prevention and control programs (Buckee et al., 2018; Hay et al., 2013).

274

This study acknowledges the relevance of other components of health access that may play an

275

important role in the underlying phenomena. The sole presence of clinic infrastructure does not

276

assure a proper healthcare delivery. Supply chain, human resources, financial accessibility,

277

acceptability of services, and availability of treatment are some remaining barriers once

278

geographical accessibility is overcome (Agbenyo et al., 2017; Al-Taiar et al., 2010; Johar,

279

Soewondo, Pujisubekti, Satrio, & Adji, 2018). Further studies were suggested to get a

280

comprehensive understanding of the accessibility to healthcare in Peru and other LMIC.

281

5. CONCLUSION

282

This study used a new methodology to estimate the travel time to most proximate health facilities

283

as a first step to understanding and characterizing the geographical accessibility profiles in Peru.

284

Contrasting patterns were observed across heterogeneous land coverage areas and urban and

285

rural settings. These findings are important as first steps for tailoring strategies to deliver

286

appropriate, affordable and quality healthcare to impoverished populations.
