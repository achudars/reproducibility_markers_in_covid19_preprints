Abstract
Background: Nursing Process is a scientific problem solving approach to direct nurses in
caring for clients effectively and to improve quality of health care service. In Ethiopia, the
national pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing process remains unknown. Hence,
the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the level of
implementation of nursing process and it association with knowledge and working
environment.
Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, PsycINFO and CINAHL
were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. To investigate
heterogeneity across the included studies, I2 test was employed. Publication bias was
examined using funnel plot and Egger’s regression test statistic. The random-effect model
was fitted to estimate the summary effects, and odds ratios (ORs). All statistical analysis was
done using STATA version 14 software for windows.

Results: Seven studies which comprises of 1,268 participants were included in this metaanalysis. The estimated pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia
was 42.44% (95% CI (36.91, 47.97%)). Based on the subgroup analysis, the highest
implementation of nursing process was observed sample size greater than or equals to two
hundred, 44.69% (95% CI: 35.34, 54.04). Nurses who have been work in the stressful
environment [(OR 0.41, 95%CI (0.08, 2.12)] and having good knowledge about nursing
process [(OR 2.44, 95%CI (0.34,17.34)] was not significant associated with the
implementation of nursing process.

Conclusion: The overall implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia is relatively low.
Nurses who have been work in the stressful environment have less likely implement nursing
process. On the other hand, Nurses who had good knowledge on nursing process were more
likely to implement nursing process. Therefore, policymakers (FMOH) and other concerned
body need give special attention to improve the implementation of nursing process.

Background
Nursing is an emerging profession with a unique perspective on people, environment and
health. Now a day the approach of client care is moved from the medical model to a holistic
care[1]. A long with it nursing process play pivotal role through patient centred, goal
oriented, way to improve the quality of nursing care, and to meet the individualized health
care needs of their clients [2-6].
Nursing process has providing holistic patient care and serve as a key for nursing practice and
education [7]. Standard implementation of nursing process could improve quality of care and
encourages the utilization of evidence based nursing practice [8, 9]. Appropriately,
implementation of nursing process, would provide meaning and relevance to professional
knowledge [10]. Globally, nursing process is an integral part of nursing education, practice,
dynamic client care and a tool for critical thinking in order to address the need of the clients
[11].
Nursing process is a vital structure that provides order and direction to nursing care.
Likewise, it is the corner stone of the nursing profession [12, 13]. Using nursing care plan as
a tool to guide nursing care will allow nurses to make some independent decisions that can
encourage healing [14]. Even though, nursing process has become the framework for nursing
care, still the perception persists that it is time consuming and impractical [15].
The utilization of nursing process could assure nurses accountability and responsibility for
the patient care and enable to measure quality of nursing care [16]. The essence of nursing
process lies on the great benefit to the client and nursing profession [17]. In addition, nursing
process guide the nursing activities in a better way, promotes quality of care, and provides
professional autonomy[18]. The implementation of nursing process has been reported in
different literature, across different region of the globe. For example, the study done in Kenya
shows 33.1% [6], 25% in Brazil [8], and 57.1% in Nigeria [1], 81.77% in Brazil [19] . On the
contrary, a study done in Congo shows about 100% [20] was not implementing nursing
process.
The implementation of nursing process is complex phenomenon and due to the presence of
multiple impeding factors. Identifying associated factors used as benchmarks to design
appropriate measure, to improve client safety and efficient utilization of resources. Several
associated factors are responsible for reducing the implementation of nursing process. For

instance, lack of theoretical and practical knowledge [20-26], institutional factors[6, 11],
professional factors[11],work overload [11, 21, 23, 25-28], lack of previous experience [6,
27], inadequate nursing staff [20], patients with complicated case[24], working in a
hospital[25], patient economic status[25], early discharge [25, 26], not cooperative [25], lack
of training [6, 18, 22, 26, 29], low educational status[27, 28], poor Nurses skill [28], lack of
time [18, 20, 27, 30], lack of authorities' support [27] and lack of equipment and material [20,
27, 28], were some of the factors associated with implementation of nursing process. On the
contrary, a study conducted in Nigeria shows that institutional factor does not pose a barrier
to the use of nursing process [30, 31].
Despite, the effort of Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health to prepared and distributed
standardized nursing care plan for all health care settings since 2011[32]. The implementation
of nursing process in different health care setting is not well developed and organized [24, 30,
33]. However, currently many health care settings demand the implementation of nursing
process in clinical practice.
In Ethiopia, Nurses constitute the backbone of healthcare delivery system to improve the
quality of health care service and implementation of nursing process may contribute a
significant role. Different studies have been conducted to determine the implementation of
nursing process and its associated factors. The findings of these fragmented studies revealed
that there was a great variability in the implementation of nursing process across the country.
Hence, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing
process in Ethiopia and its association with working environment and knowledge. Finding
from the current study would serve as input for educators, clinicians, program planner, and
policy makers working in the area of nursing process implementation to design a new
approach or strengthen the existing nursing process.

Methods
Design and Search strategy
A two-step search strategy was used to identify all relevant literature. First, six electronic
databases such PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Scopus, and
PsycINFO were searched to extract all available literature. Second, a hand search of gray
literature and other related articles in order to identify additional relevant research. In
addition, all electronic sources of information were searched from conception to April 1st, /
2019. The search strategy was developed using Population Exposure Controls Outcome and

verbal reports of nurses working in a hospital or outpatient unit, in at least one of the
following phases: data collection, nursing diagnosis, prescription of nursing and evaluation of
nursing [22, 25, 33]. The determinant variables included in this review were; working
environment (well-organized vs stressful) and knowledge on nursing process (good
knowledge vs poor knowledge).

Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted by two authors using a pre-piloted and standardized data extraction
format prepared in a Microsoft Excel spread sheet. Data on author/s name, year of
publication, study area/Region, health institution, study design, sample size, prevalence,
determinant factors and the quality score of each study were extracted from each included
article by three independent authors (Y.A,W.S, and T.Y). The quality of each study was
assessed using modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional study[34].
Studies were included in the analysis if they scored ≥5 out of 10 points in three domains of
modified NOS components for cross-sectional studies [34, 35]. The score point of each
domain is selection (5 points), comparability (2 points), and outcome assessment (3 points).
Finally, the quality score of each study was extracted from incorporated article by three
independent authors. Any disagreements at the time of data abstraction were resolved by
discussion and consensus.

modified Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias tool for prevalence studies developed by Hoy and colleagues [36] was used
to assess the risk of bias among included studies reporting on the prevalence of
implementation of nursing process (supplementary file 2 for Hoy et al tool). On the other
hand, the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool was used to assess the risk of bias for studies
reporting the factors associated with the implementation of nursing process [37]. Both
authors were undertake the risk of bias assessment of the included studies independently.

Statistical analysis
A meta-analysis of the implementation of nursing process was carried out using a randomeffects (DerSimonian and Laird) method since it is the most common method in a meta6

analysis to adjust for the observed variability [38]. Heterogeneity across the studies was
checked using the I2 statistics test[38]. In addition, to investigate the possible sources of
heterogeneity, meta-regression and subgroup analysis were deployed. Publication bias was
assessed by visual inspection of a funnel plot. Similarly, Egger test was conducted and a
p≤0.05was considered statistically significant for the presence of publication bias [39,
40]. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate whether the pooled effect
size was influenced by individual studies. The pooled effect size (i.e. proportion and odds
ratio (OR)) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was generated and presented using a forest
plot. All data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 14.0
software for Windows [41].

Presentation and reporting of results
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
guideline was used to publish the proposed systematic review[42]. The PRISMA checklist
was used alongside the final review (supplementary file 3). The entire process of study
screening, selection and inclusion were depicted with the aid of a flow diagram. A reason for
study exclusion was documented and summary shown in the flow diagram. Quantitative data
were presented on forest plots and summary tables.

Result
Search results
We found that a total of 648 articles, of these, 643 studies were found from six international
databases and the remaining 5 were through manual search. Databases includes; PubMed (4),
Scopus (83), psyInfo (46), Cochrane library data base (68), Google scholar (327), and
CINHAL (115). Out of them, 239 duplicate records were identified and removed. From the
remaining 409 articles, 363 articles were excluded after reading of titles and abstracts based
on the pre-defined inclusion criteria’s. Finally, 29 full text articles were assessed for
eligibility criteria. Based on the pre-defined criteria and quality assessment, only 7 articles
were included for the final analysis (figure 1).

Baseline characteristic of the included studies
A total of 7 studies with 1,268 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Of those, two
studies [24, 33] were conducted in Amharic region, one [22] in Afar region, one [23] in
Addis Ababa, one [29] in Harari region, and the remaining one [28] in Tigray region.
Regarding sample size more than half of the studies (57.14%) were less than two hundred
[22, 24-26]. The highest prevalence of implementation of nursing process (52.1%) was
reported from Addis Ababa and the lowest (32.7%) in South Nation Nationality and People.
Based on modified Newcastle Ottawa score quality assessment almost all seven articles fulfil
the required quality. All the included studies were cross-sectional by design and were
conducted among nurses working in different clinical setting of Ethiopia (Table1).

Implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia
The result of this meta-analysis using random effects model showed that the pooled
prevalence of implementation nursing process in Ethiopia was 42.44% (95% CI: 36.90-47.97)
(Figure 2) with high significant level of heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 74.1%; p < 0.001).
The presence of significant magnitude of heterogeneity also suggests the need to conduct
subgroup analysis. To identifying the sources of heterogeneity, there is a need to employed
sub group analysis by using study sample size to evaluate the implementation nursing process
(Figure 3). The finding of subgroup analysis using sample size showed that the highest
implementation of nursing process was observed studies done using sample size was greater

than or equals to 200 (44.7% (95% CI: 35.34,54.04), I = 84.8%).

Investigating source of heterogeneity
As the test statistic shows that there is a significant heterogeneity within and between the
included studies (I2 statistics=74.1%). Hence, to minimize the source of heterogeneity
between the point estimates of the primary study, subgroup analysis was done based on study
sample size. In addition, in order to identify the possible source of variation across the
included studies, we have performed meta-regression by using publication year and sample
size of each article as covariate of interest. However, the result of the meta-regression
analysis showed that both covariates were not statistically significant for the presence of
heterogeneity (Table 2).

Publication bias
To identify the presence of publication bias, funnel plot, and egger’s test was performed. The
visual inspection of the funnel plots showed symmetrical distribution, which is the evidence
for absence publication bias (Figure 4). Likewise, symmetry of the funnel plot was not
statistically significant as evidenced by egger test (P=0.349). Furthermore, the findings of
sensitivity analyses using random effects model revealed that no single study affect the
overall implementation of nursing process (figure 5).

Association between working environment and implementation of nursing process
The finding of the current meta-analysis revealed that, Nurses who are working in the
stressful area were 59% less likely to implement nursing process compared to those working
in a well-organized area, (OR: 0.41 (95% CI (0.08, 2.12)) (Figure 5), even if not statistically
significant. The heterogeneity test (P= 0.000) shows significant evidence of variation across
studies. Moreover, the evidence from Egger’s test shows that there was a no significant proof
of publication bias (P = 0.291).

Association between knowledge and implementation of nursing process
According to the finding of recent meta-analysis study, Nurses who had good knowledge on
nursing process had 2.44 times higher chance of being implementing nursing process
compared to those who have poor knowledge (OR: 2.44 (95% CI (0.34,17.34)) (Figure 7).
Though, the finding is not statistically significant. The heterogeneity test (P= 0.000) showed
a significant evidence of variation across studies. However, the result of Egger’s test showed
that no statistically significant evidence of publication bias (P = 0.510).

Discussion
The main objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate the pooled
prevalence of implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia and its association with working
environment and knowledge. In line with this objective the findings of 7 included studies
were revealed that the overall implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia was 42.44%
(95% CI: 36.9, 47.9%). The finding of the current study indicated in this meta-analysis is
higher than the study done in Kenya which showed 33.1% [6] , and Brazil 25% [8]. On the
contrary, the finding is lower than a study done in Nigeria 57.1%[1] and 81.77% in Brazil
[19]. The possible explanations for the above variations might be methodological differences
(i.e., data analysis and eligibility of study participants), variation in awareness, knowledge
and educational background among nurses, policy and strategy difference and health service
utilization.
The result of the subgroup analysis based on sample size (i.e. sample size <200 and ≥200)
showed that the highest pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing process was

observed from studies done with sample size were greater than or equal to 200 which
revealed that 44.7% (95%CI: 35.34, 54.04). As a result, the findings of the subgroup analysis
revealed that variability was observed in the overall implementation of nursing process across
the category of each sample size. The possible explanation for this variation might be if the
sample size is increase it would provide the true estimate of the population.
The current meta-analysis was estimated the association between nurses knowledge on
nursing process and implementation of nursing process. Nurses who had good knowledge
were positively associated with the implementation of nursing process. Even though, it is not
statistically significant. Nurses who had good knowledge were almost 2.44 times more likely
to implement nursing process as compared to those who had poor knowledge. This finding is
in line with the studies conducted in different region of the globe [43-46]. Likewise, the
finding also supported with other study, in which nurses who have theoretical knowledge on
the meaning of nursing process could successfully promoting the quality of care for the
client through the implementation of nursing process [18, 47].
According to the current meta-analysis finding, Nurses who have been working at a stressful
working environment were nearly 59% less likely to implement nursing process as compared
to those who have working at well-organized environment. Even thought, it is not statistically
significant. The finding is in agreement with study conducted in Egypt [48]. This might be
reflect that the establishment of conducive environment to make effective and efficient
nursing practice, viewed by previous researches as important aspects that affected nurses
ability to conduct “good” practice.
Though this meta-analysis has provided important information and synthesise evidence
regarding the implementation of nursing process, there are some limitations that need to be
considered in the future research. First, only English articles were considered; Second, most
of the studies included had small sample size; Third, it was challenging to synthesise some
additional factors meanwhile they were not examined in a related approach across the studies;
Fourth, all included studies were reported hospital-based data. Lastly, it was challenging to
compare and contrast our finding with others because of lack of other published systematic
review and meta-analysis on the implementation of nursing process.

Implications for Nursing Practice
This meta-analysis has implication for clinical practice. Estimating the pooled prevalence of
implementation of nursing process would provide current evidence to the utilization of
nursing process, application of standardized care, to improve patient satisfaction, and to
address the client demand. Which enable Hospital wards should be adequately staffed with
nurses to prevent the situation of stressful working environment as a factor responsible for
inconsistent use of nursing process. In addition, it facilitates to design different strategies for
enhancing nurse knowledge on nursing process. Furthermore, the finding serves as alarming
to health care professional to give a focus on the application of standardized care and
represents a marker of quality of care.

Conclusion and recommendations
The overall implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia is significantly low. Nurses who
work in the stressful environment had a negative influence the implementation of nursing
process. Nurses who had good knowledge on nursing process were more likely to implement
nursing process. Therefore, policymakers (FMOH) could give special attention to the
implementation of nursing process to improve the overall quality of healthcare service.
Furthermore, further qualitative study is needed to explore the reason behind poor
implementation of nursing process.
