Abstract
While diet response prediction for cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs) has been demonstrated
using single SNPs and main-effect genetic risk scores, little investigation has gone into the
development of genome-wide diet response scores. We sought to leverage the multi-study setup
of the Women’s Health Initiative cohort to generate and test genetic scores for the response of
six CRFs (body mass index, systolic blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
triglycerides, and fasting glucose) to dietary fat. A genome-wide interaction study was
undertaken for each CRF in women (n ~ 10000) not participating in the Dietary Modification
(DM) trial, which focused on the reduction of dietary fat. Genetic scores based on these analyses
were developed using a pruning-and-thresholding approach and tested for the prediction of oneyear CRF changes as well as long-term chronic disease development in DM trial participants (n
~ 5000). One of these genetic scores, for LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), predicted changes in the
associated CRF. This 1760-variant score explained 3.4% of the variance in one-year LDL-C
changes in the intervention arm, but was unassociated with changes in the control arm. In
contrast, a main-effect genetic risk score for LDL-C was not useful for predicting dietary fat
response. Further investigation of this score with respect to downstream disease outcomes
revealed suggestive differential associations across DM trial arms, especially with respect to
coronary heart disease and stroke subtypes. These results lay the foundation for the combination
of many genome-wide gene-diet interactions for diet response prediction while highlighting the
need for further research and larger samples in order to achieve robust biomarkers for use in
personalized nutrition.

Introduction
Nutrigenetics approaches, in which genetic information is used to predict response to dietary
inputs, are central to the emerging promise of personalized nutrition for cardiometabolic risk
reduction. Inter-individual differences in food preferences, metabolism, detoxification, excretion,
etc. affect our responses to diet, in a similar manner to the well-studied field of
pharmacogenomics (1). Ideally, genotype-based nutrigenetic investigations would be conducted
in large-scale dietary interventions. Two notable examples are the PREDIMED and POUNDS
LOST trial, with significant findings including the interaction of a TCF7L2 variant with a
Mediterranean diet pattern for glycemic traits (2) and the interaction of a PCSK9 variant with
dietary carbohydrate for insulin resistance (3). However, such intervention-based studies are able
to examine only a single dietary change (whether food, nutrient, or pattern) at a time, and are
often limited to lower sample sizes (4).
To allow for more flexibility and greater sample sizes, gene-diet interactions (GDIs) are more
commonly investigated in observational datasets. There is a rich literature of GDI discovery in
the cardiometabolic realm. Typically, these focus on cardiometabolic risk factors in relation to
biology-based candidate genes/variants (5,6), but some have looked at clinical outcomes (e.g. MI
(7)). Other approaches use main-effect genetic risk scores, such as that for obesity interacting
with sugar-sweetened beverage intake to influence anthropometric traits (8,9).
Characterization of individuals based on single or small groups of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) likely neglects important signal elsewhere in the genome, especially
when dealing with highly polygenic cardiometabolic traits. Thus, for effective personalized
nutrition approaches to be realized, it is necessary to integrate signals across the genome. A few
investigations have explored GDIs genome-wide, such as for dairy and BMI (10) and for various
dietary components and colorectal cancer (11). However, genome-wide interaction studies
(GWIS) can be problematic due to the lower statistical power inherent in gene-environment
interaction analyses (12). Furthermore, the potential for confounding and reverse causation
(i.e. cardiometabolic risk impacting dietary behavior) in statistical interactions from
observational data means that GDIs may not always predict modification of the risk factor in
question after a dietary intervention.
In order to provide proof-of-concept for the use of GDIs in developing comprehensive diet
response genetic scores, we sought to develop a genome-wide, GDI-based dietary fat response
score for each of a series of cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs). We performed genome-wide
interaction studies for six CRFs, prioritizing sites with documented nominal main effects in prior
genome-wide association studies, and used these intermediate results to derive fat response
scores (FRS) for each CRF. We tested the performance of these scores in the fat reductionfocused Women’s Health Initiative Dietary Modification trial, finding that an FRS for LDLcholesterol (LDL-C) predicts 1-year LDL-C changes selectively in the intervention arm.
Furthermore, we found associations of the LDL-C FRS with incident coronary heart disease and
stroke subtypes specifically in the fat-reduction arm of the trial over approximately 22 years of
follow-up.

Methods
Women’s Health Initiative Dataset
The Women’s Health Initiative study consists of a series of substudies: three clinical trials
(related to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis) and an observational study (13).
Over 160,000 participants were enrolled between 1993-1998, with the ability to enroll in up to 3
of the clinical trials simultaneously. For the purposes of this analysis, participants were
categorized based only on whether or not they were enrolled in the dietary modification (DM)
trial, which randomized almost 50,000 women to a low-fat diet or a control diet with no
recommended dietary changes, with primary outcomes being incidence of breast and colorectal
cancers and heart disease [(14). Study of these participants conformed to the ethical guidelines
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and this research was approved by the Tufts Health
Sciences IRB (protocol 12592).
Participants were comprehensively screened at baseline, including physical measurements, blood
sample collection, and questionnaire administration, while only a subset of participants provided
blood samples or returned questionnaires during later visits. The food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) was designed specifically for the WHI study, emphasizing specific foods and preparation
methods to maximize its sensitivity to changes in fat intake (15).
Phenotype data were accessed from dbGaP (accession: phs000746.v2.p3). Values shown in
Table 1 only pertain to women whose genotypes were measured in one of a series of follow-up
studies. For gene-diet interaction analyses, SBP, LDL-C, and GLU were adjusted for medication
use: LDL-C and GLU values were divided by 0.75 for those on lipid-lowering and anti-diabetic
medication, respectively, and SBP values were increased by 15 mmHg for those on antihypertensive medication. This type of adjustment for medication use has precedent in geneenvironment interaction analyses (16). Cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) were winsorized at 5
standard deviations from the mean and those other than LDL-C (BMI, SBP, HDL-C, TG, and
GLU) were log-transformed prior to analysis. Longitudinal risk factor changes were calculated in
DM trial participants as the difference between baseline and year 1. Adjudicated time-to-event
data for chronic disease outcomes (coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemic
stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and non-CVD death) were collected, while diabetes incidence was
defined as the self-report of any of: diabetes pills, insulin treatment, or general treatment for
diabetes. Follow-up data was available for approximately 22 years following enrollment.
Phenotype data processing was performed using R version 3.4.3 (17) and Python version 3.6.0.
Genotype data and preprocessing
Imputed genotype data were retrieved from dbGaP (accession: phs000746.v2.p3) as a
harmonized set of imputation outputs from a series of genotyping studies involving WHI
participants. Prior to imputation, study-specific quality control steps had been undertaken on
directly-genotyped SNPs, with filters based on sample and call rate, Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, and minor allele frequency. Phasing had been performed for autosomes using
BEAGLE, followed by imputation using minimac (MACH for the SHARe study subset). After
download from dbGaP, variants were converted from dose format using dose2plink
(http://genepi.qimr.edu.au/staff/sarahMe/dose2plink), filtered for imputation R-squared > 0.3 and
minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.001, and annotated with rsIDs, loci, and allelic information

using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 download from dbSNP (download date: April 13, 2018). Only
variants passing the imputation quality threshold in all genotyping sub-studies were included in
the final dosage dataset. For score development and calculation, imputed variant dosages were
converted to hard-calls and set to missing if the estimated dosage was not within 0.1 of an integer
allele count. Post-imputation genotype data processing was performed using PLINK 2.0, while
clumping and score calculation were performed using PLINK 1.9 (18).
Genome-wide interaction studies
A genome-wide interaction study was performed for each of the six cardiometabolic risk factors.
The genome-wide scan used an additive genotype model, adjusted for fixed effects including
dietary fat (binary: % of kcals above or below the median), total kcals per day, age, five ancestry
principal components, and genotyping sub-study. Genotyping was performed in a series of
ancillary studies in WHI including Hip Fracture, GARNET, WHIMS+, GECCO (initial or
CytoSNP), and AS264/MOPMAP. (Many participants were also genotyped as a part of the
SHARe effort, but those women were of African American and Hispanic ancestry and thus were
not included in the GWIS portion of this study.) Five of six sub-studies were adjusted for as
binary variables to avoid collinearity. The primary estimand of interest was the interaction term
between dietary fat and minor allele count at the SNP of interest. Interaction analyses were
carried out using PLINK 2.0 (18). Variants of interest were annotated to genes using Annovar
(19).
Gene-environment interaction power calculations for single SNPs were performed using the
Quanto tool (20). The following assumptions were made: additive model; variance explained by
genotype alone = 0.5%; and binary environment with 50% prevalence and explaining 10% of
variance. (Note: there is no effect of minor allele frequency in this case given that variances
explained are directly specified.)
Genetic responder score construction and evaluation
To prioritize variants for inclusion in genetic responder scores, nominal (p < 0.05) variants for
main-effect on each risk factor were retrieved from large-scale meta-analyses: GIANT for BMI
(21); International Consortium for Blood Pressure for SBP (22); Global Lipid Genetics
Consortium (GLGC) for LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG (23); and MAGIC for fasting glucose (24).
Each FRS was constructed using summary statistics for the diet-SNP interaction terms from the
associated GWIS. SNPs were filtered for nominal main-effect relationships using the above
meta-analyses, and interaction summary statistics were used as input to a pruning-andthresholding (P&T) procedure (using the “–clump” function in PLINK 1.9), with a seed
threshold of p=0.05 and an LD threshold of r2=0.5. The linkage disequilibrium references for the
procedure was calculated from genotypes of the white DM trial participants. Genetic fat response
scores (FRS) for each individual were then calculated as the weighted sum of allelic dosages for
variants selected by the P&T procedure, with weights corresponding to the GWIS interaction
term estimates. This type of diet interaction-based genetic score development has been described
previously, for example in a Korean cohort with respect to body fat changes (25). A genetic risk
score for LDL-C was created using the GLGC LDL-C meta-analysis summary statistics and the
same P&T method and parameters as was used for the interaction analyses, resulting in a 26467SNP score.

FRS were used to test for discrimination of changes in CRFs over the first year of the DM trial.
Risk factor changes were assessed using linear models in participants in the intervention arm,
with and without adjustment for baseline CRF levels. As a sensitivity analysis, p-values were
calculated in separate models for interaction of the genetic score with 1) trial arm (control
vs. dietary modification), and 2) observed fat reduction (negative vs. positive 3-year change in
FFQ-estimated dietary fat). GRS were further tested for prediction of chronic disease
development during follow-up across DM trial strata. Time-to-event for each of coronary heart
disease, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and non-CVD death were
used to fit age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, including a random effect term for
genotyping sub-study (cluster() term in the coxph function call). Estimated log-hazard ratios
were extracted from regressions conducted in the following strata: 1) DM trial intervention arm,
2) DM trial control arm, 3) DM trial intervention arm filtered for participants with 1-year fat
reduction based on FFQ, and 4) DM trial control arm filtered for participants with 1-year fat
increase based on FFQ.

Results
Dietary fat responder score development
A series of genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) were undertaken in cross-sectional data
from the Women’s Health Initiative. These GWIS incorporated only women who did not
participate in the dietary modification (DM) trial, using imputed genotypes along with baseline
self-reported dietary intakes (from food frequency questionnaires) and fasting blood biomarkers.
Baseline characteristics of these women, along with those participating in the DM trial, are
shown in Table 1.
Preliminary power calculations were undertaken, based on parameter assumptions including a
modest SNP main effect (0.5%) under an additive model and a binary environment with 50%
prevalence explaining 10% of the outcome phenotypic variance. The results showed that, at the
sample sizes available for European ancestry non-DM participants (7000-10000 individuals for
each cardiometabolic risk factor (CRF)), this analysis was powered to detect only moderately
large interaction effects (GxE variance explained greater than approximately 0.5%) at genomewide significance (Supp. Table S1).
Dietary fat response scores were generated for each CRF using results from the corresponding
GWIS analysis. Linear regression models were fit for log-transformed baseline CRF values
(other than LDL-C), incorporating gene-dietary fat interactions (dietary fat represented as a
binary % of total calories above or below the median) while adjusting for age, total calories, five
genetic principal components, and genotyping sub-study. Q-Q plots of the GWIS results showed
that genomic inflation was fairly well-controlled (Supp. Figure S1). For each CRF, the associated
summary statistics (corresponding to the fat-genotype interaction term estimates) were filtered to
include only those with nominal main-effect associations in large-scale published GWAS. This
filter was informed by the power analysis above and chosen as a compromise between discovery
and statistical power (alternative results using either a more stringent threshold or no filtering are
shown in Supp. Table S2). A pruning-and-thresholding method was used to generate six FRS
from these individual sets of summary statistics along with genotypes from the WHI DM
participants as a linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference. Using parameters of seed p-value=0.05

and LD r2<0.5, six sets of score weights were generated, with relevant SNP set sizes ranging
from 1536 (SBP) to 6042 (BMI). Scores were then calculated as the weighted sum of allele
counts across SNPs, normalized by the number of non-missing SNPs per individual.
Dietary fat responder score assessment
As the scores were developed to predict a positive interaction with dietary fat intake, the
expected direction of the FRS effect on risk factors in the present fat-reduction trial would be
negative. Of the fat response scores examined, only the LDL-C fat response score (LDL-FRS)
was predictive at p < 0.05 of the associated CRF change in DM trial participants in the fatreduction arm (passing a Bonferroni correction for the 6 CRFs tested in baseline-adjusted
sensitivity models). For this score, the standardized effect size was -0.18 (corresponding to a 5.1
mg/dL greater decrease in LDL-C per score standard deviation; p=0.026). We note that the
sample size of European-ancestry DM trial participants with follow-up measurements was much
smaller for biochemical variables (n~150) compared to BMI and SBP (n~2000). Using the score
developed in European-ancestry individuals, score performance was then tested in a combinedancestry group including Black and Hispanic individuals, which almost doubled the sample size
(Supp. Table S3). While some traits showed strong relationships (e.g. SBP), the signs of many
were in a counter-intuitive direction, including a flip in sign for the previously-strong LDL-C
relationship, suggesting that these results reflect primarily differences in ancestry rather than the
intended biological differences. This observation was reinforced by the lack of association of the
score with CRF changes in either Blacks or Hispanics alone.
Based on its observed association in European-ancestry participants, the LDL-FRS was
investigated further. Linear models showed that the LDL-FRS accounted for 3.4% of the
variance in 1-year LDL-C changes in the DM intervention arm. In baseline-adjusted models, this
figure rose slightly to 3.9, based on the R2 change from a baseline-only model. Additional
models confirmed an interaction between DM trial arm and the LDL-FRS (p=0.011), supporting
the specificity of this score for the fat-reduction arm. The LDL-FRS also showed specificity for
LDL-C in that it did not predict changes in any other CRF (Supp. Table S4). The 1760
component SNPs were annotated using Annovar (19), revealing a predominance of intergenic
and intronic variants and a set of genes with high numbers of independent SNPs contributing to
the score (Figure 1a-d). Top genes by number of contributing SNPs included CSMD1, PTPRD,
and RGS12.
Differences in mean LDL-C changes during the DM trial across genetic score strata are shown in
Figure 1e,f. As suggested by the regression results, those in the control arm trended towards less
strong LDL-C reductions in higher LDL-FRS strata, while those in the fat-reduction arm showed
the opposite trend. Furthermore, isolation of individuals at the highest extreme of the score (top
10%) revealed an LDL-C reduction of almost double that of the rest of the DM intervention
group (-39.0 versus -20.0 mg/dL). For comparison to the FRS, a main-effect genetic risk score
(GRS) for LDL-C was developed using summary statistics from the Global Lipid Genetics
Consortium meta-analysis (23) and an identical pruning-and-thresholding procedure to that used
for the GDI-based scores. As expected, this score was strongly predictive of baseline LDL-C
concentrations (p=4.53e-27). However, unlike the GDI-based score, the GRS did not predict
LDL-C changes in the DM intervention group (p=0.15; stratum-specific mean changes in Figure
1f).

LDL-FRS association with chronic disease outcomes
Next, the LDL-FRS was tested for relationships with incident disease outcomes over
approximately 22 years of follow-up (Figure 2). Cox proportional hazards models were used,
adjusting for age at baseline and including a random effect for genotyping sub-study. This
frailty/random effects model has been recommended for optimizing power in multi-center timeto-event models (26). In addition to intervention versus control arm, another set of “per protocollike” strata was produced by additionally filtering for FFQ-based self-reported fat reduction (in
the intervention group) or fat increase (in the control group). CHD qualitatively showed the
expected interaction, i.e. a stronger inverse association between LDL-FRS and disease risk in the
fat reduction group). Ischemic stroke showed a similar pattern, with a risk reduction only in the
fat reduction group (p = 0.020). In contrast, hemorrhagic stroke, while having a low number of
events (44 in total), showed a positive association only in the fat reduction group (p = 0.011).
Results for diabetes qualitatively mirrored those for CHD and ischemic stroke, while those for
non-CVD death did not vary across groups. These cross-arm differences were generally
strengthened when comparing the per protocol-like strata, with a much stronger effect for CHD
in the confirmed fat reduction stratum (p = 4.07e-5). In DM trial arm interaction models (score x
arm), only ischemic stroke reached nominal statistical significance (p < 0.05).

Discussion
Diet response scores have shown some success in predicting the response of cardiovascular risk
factors (CRFs) to nutritional interventions, but they are often based solely on main effects or
single GDI SNPs. Here, we explored the potential for gene diet interaction (GDI)-based diet
responder score development, leveraging the multi-trial setup of the Women’s Health Initiative.
We developed what to our knowledge is the first example of a diet response score based on a
hypothesis-free genome scan for each of six risk factors, and showed preliminary evidence for
the viability of a LDL-C fat response score. The set of SNPs used for each score were limited to
those showing nominal main effects in large-scale GWAS as a compromise between discovery
and utilization of prior information, which was supported by the weaker results in sensitivity
models incorporating either stronger (suggestive main-effect) or weaker (all SNPs) variant filters
(Supp. Table S2).
Though FRS for six CRFs were developed and tested, only that for LDL-C showed nominal
significance in predicting 1-year changes in the corresponding CRF. Multiple factors could
explain this lack of predictive performance in general. First, analysis in observational datasets
carries with it the potential for confounding of the observed relationships. Second, FFQs are
imprecise instruments for measuring dietary intake, and though the FFQs used in the present
study were optimized for detection of dietary fat, there was potential for substantial
misclassification of this environmental exposure. Third, power calculations shown here and
elsewhere suggest that a cohort of this size may not be powered to detect many very small geneenvironment interactions such as are sought in genome-wide approaches like the one used here.
CSMD1, PTPRD, and RGS12 stood out as genes containing the highest number of SNPs in the
LDL-FRS (11, 9, and 9, respectively, after LD-pruning for r2 < 0.5. CSMD1 variants are notably
associated with LDL-C response to statin treatment (27) as well as SBP response to a high-salt
diet [Newton-Cheh2009]. CSMD1 has also shown epigenetic associations with LDL-C (28) as

well as response to modification of dietary fat composition (29). PTPRD variants modulate the
response of T2D patients to pioglitazone therapy (30) and show suggestive associations with
eating behaviors (caloric intake at dinner) (31). RGS12 has been linked to LDL-C in GWAS
(32). Altogether, these genes have literature evidence for relationships to dietary intake, response
to cardiometabolic therapies, and LDL-C, but have not until now been shown to directly modify
the LDL-C response to dietary fat proportions. We note that there is a bias towards identifying
LDL-C-related variants in the LDL-FRS, as only nominally-associated main-effect SNPs were
used as input to the score development algorithm.
A reasonable body of literature exists establishing GDIs for both dietary fat on CRFs (33,34) and
general dietary exposures on LDL-C (35). Multiple studies have looked specifically at genetic
variants modulating the LDL-C response to dietary fat. For example, a caloric restriction
intervention in type 2 diabetics was more effective in reducing LDL-C in ApoE4 carriers (15.6% versus -0.7%) (36). Two studies using the POUNDS LOST trial found relationships of
specific polymorphisms with 2-year changes in response to a dietary fat intervention. Carriers of
a risk allele at the APOA5 variant rs964184 show a decrease of 7.5 mg/dL in LDL-C in low-fat
but not high-fat interventions (37), and carriers of the minor allele at CETP rs3764261 show an
8.9 mg/dL greater decrease in LDL-C on a low-fat diet (38). Our observed effect size of a 5.4
mg/dL decrease in LDL-C is of a similar magnitude to these findings, and emerged despite the
multi-factorial nature of the WHI DM trial (which incorporated additional nutrition
recommendations). The observed variance explained of 3.4% for the LDL-FRS means that the
score, while contributing meaningfully to the prediction, does not capture most of the
interindividual variability in LDL-C response to the WHI DM trial intervention. Based on prior
observations of an inflection point in the impact of various genetic risk scores near the 90th
percentile (39), we additionally evaluated the impact of LDL-FRS in the top 10%, finding almost
double the LDL-C reduction in DM intervention participants with values at this extreme.
There has been interest in the past in using main-effect genetic risk scores (GRS) as genetic
variables in order to improve statistical power to detect gene-environment interactions (40). Such
interactions may be viewed from a lens in which genetic risk corresponds to a predisposition that
is only triggered in certain environments (e.g. dietary behaviors). Here, we observed only a
minor association of a main-effect GRS for LDL-C with greater LDL-C reductions in the DM
trial (p=4.5e-27). This trend runs counter to a prior observation of greater lifestyle intervention
effectiveness for LDL-C reduction in those with low genetic risk of hyperlipidemia (41). This
discrepancy may be due to differences between the DM trial and the personalized diet and
lifestyle changes recommended in the intervention in question. Regardless, the meaningful
increase in predictive power of the GDI-based FRS compared to the main-effect GRS for LDL-C
indicates the value in using interaction-based scores rather than simple genetic predispositions
for the development of personalized dietary recommendations.
A diet response score such as that developed here is most useful if its value extends beyond just
risk factor changes and predicts downstream changes in chronic disease and mortality risk.
Suggestive interactions for CHD, ischemic stroke, and diabetes were apparent across strata
(Figure 2a,b,d), corresponding to a decreased risk in fat-reduction participants (whose LDL-C
would be expected to drop more prominently according to the score). In contrast, hemorrhagic
stroke showed the opposite trend, with a positive score-disease relationship only in the fat
reduction group. This result is in line with existing evidence for the detrimental effects of low
LDL-C on hemorrhagic stroke risk (42). Non-CVD death showed no major associations, which

could be expected due to the dominance of this category by cancer outcomes and the equivocal
associations of cancer with lipids (43). We note that all disease outcome relationships assessed
here are subject to the major caveat that dietary evolution and decreased adherence likely
developed over time in many subjects, diluting the utility of the randomization and 1-year
changes used for stratification in Figure 2.
The present study had the advantage of developing a GDI-based dietary fat score in almost
10,000 women and testing in a dietary intervention trial using independent individuals from the
same population. However, nominal main-effect SNPs were prioritized to improve statistical
power given this moderate sample size, an approach which may fail to identify interactions with
effect directions opposite that of the main effect. Smaller fractions of alternate ancestries in this
population also made development of ancestry-specific response scores unrealistic. Additionally,
the DM trial intervention in which the scores were tested may not exactly match the intervention
relevant to the purely fat reduction-focused score developed here; it included additional non-fatrelated dietary recommendations that may have effected the interactions examined here, and did
not ultimately achieve its intended 20% fat reduction. Finally, this study only examined women,
despite the fact that CRF profiles and their genetic trait architectures are known to vary across
sexes (44).
In summary, we present a method for the development of diet response scores based on genomewide gene-diet interaction study summary statistics. While the resulting dietary fat response
scores are not all informative, a score focused on LDL-C is predictive of 1-year LDL-C changes
during a fat reduction trial. Its performance is risk factor-specific, and is superior to that of a
main-effect genetic risk score for LDL-C. Furthermore, it displays suggestive relationships with
chronic disease outcomes, following known coronary heart disease biology and adding a new
perspective to known discrepancies between associations of LDL-C with cardiovascular disease
and stroke subtypes. These findings support the utility of gene-diet interactions for personalized
nutrition while highlighting the need for increased sample sizes and improved diet measures for
the discovery of robust genetic predictors of diet response.
