Abstract
Background

Vascular limb salvage services can potentially improve outcomes for patients with chronic
limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) and/or diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). This study aims to
evaluate the early outcomes for a vascular limb salvage (VaLS) clinic and investigate timesto-treatment.

Methods

A retrospective analysis involving all patients diagnosed with CLTI/DFU within the VaLS
clinic from February 2018-February 2019 was undertaken. Data were compared to two
comparator cohorts; patients managed prior to the clinic, between May 2017-February 2018
(Pre-Clinic’ (PC)), and patients managed outside of clinic, between February 2018-February
2019 (‘Alternative Pathways’ (AP)). Major amputation at 12 months was the primary
outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and adjusted Cox’s proportional hazard models
were utilised to compare outcomes.

Results

Six-hundred and forty-six patients (VaLS=200, PC=252, AP=194) were included (median
age=73 years, median follow-up=365 days). Within the VaLS clinic, patients underwent
assessment within a median of 2.1[IQR 1.3-3.1] days from referral. No differences in median
time from assessment to treatment were identified (VaLS=6.1[3.9-11.1] vs. AP=5.7[2.6-12.9]
days, p=.394; VaLS vs. PC=6.1[2.8-22.8] days, p=.888). The VaLS cohort had a significantly
lower rate of major amputation at 12 months (9.5%) compared to both the AP (19.6%, aHR

0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.74, p=.003) and the PC (19.4%; aHR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78, p=.004)
cohorts, after adjustment for potential confounding.

Conclusions

A limb salvage clinic can help reduce the rate of major amputation and provides a model
which delivers timely vascular assessment. Whilst early outcomes are promising, further
evaluation is required to assess longer-term outcomes and reduce time-to-treatment.

Introduction
Despite efforts to improve the care given to patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia
(CLTI) comparatively little attention has been paid to evolving the clinical pathways through
which patients are managed. The provision and focus on multi-disciplinary team (MDT)
working remains one of the biggest and most beneficial changes in this area, particularly for
patients with neuro-ischaemic diabetic foot wounds.1,

2

Even in the age of MDT working

however, lengthy time delays in the management of both CLTI and diabetic foot ulceration
(DFU) remain, with these delays having detrimental effects on patient outcomes.3 Reasons
cited for these delays include difficulties accessing specialist vascular services by
‘community’ and ‘non-specialist’ healthcare professionals, along with unnecessary
assessment by ‘non-specialist’ professionals prior to referral.4-6
In an attempt to help improve care and reduce rates of major amputation, the Vascular
Society of Great Britain and Ireland (VSGBI) recently published its ‘Peripheral Arterial
Disease Quality Improvement Framework’ (PAD QIF), which for the first time stipulates
target times for the assessment and treatment of patients with CLTI (Figure 1).7 Whilst the
ambition of these targets is laudable, they are by the VSGBI’s own description “deliberately
challenging” and as of yet it remains unclear how hospitals will achieve compliance.7
Specialist vascular limb salvage services are one model of care which potentially provide a
solution to these challenges. Although services can take different forms (reflecting the
diverse nature of healthcare systems), at their core they provide rapid-access to specialist
vascular assessment and revascularisation of an ischaemic limb, along with emergency
debridement of necrosis and drainage of infection.8-10 In February 2018, the Leicester
Vascular Institute in the United Kingdom opened a vascular limb salvage (VaLS) clinic to
help improve amputation outcomes for patients with CLTI.

To-date, examples of these services are highly limited and predominantly focus on the care of
patients with DFU.11-21 Furthermore, no studies have investigated the effect of limb salvage
services on times-to-treatment. The aims of this study are therefore to, a) describe the service
provided by the VaLS clinic, b) evaluate the early (12-months) limb salvage outcomes for
patients managed within the clinic’s first year of operation and compare these outcomes to a
group of controls, and c) investigate the effect of limb salvage services on times-to-treatment.

Methodology
Setting
Prior to the inception of the VaLS clinic, patients with CLTI were managed through the
traditional in/outpatient model of care. Outpatient pathways facilitated the initial management
of patients with rest pain and/or dry necrosis, with formal written referrals required from
community/non-specialist healthcare professionals. In many cases patients were subsequently
admitted to the vascular ward to expedite treatment. In cases of suppurative infection, wet
gangrene or sepsis, patients were admitted directly to the Leicester Vascular Institute as
emergent cases to facilitate treatment. All patients had access to lower limb arterial duplex
ultrasonography (+/- computerised tomography angiography [CTA]) with subsequent
decisions on treatment discussed in weekly MDT meetings. In May 2017, the department
enacted a policy to lead the inpatient care of patients with acute diabetic foot complications
(excluding acute Charcot arthropathy), irrespective of the presence of PAD.
The VaLS clinic opened on 7th February 2018 with the purpose of providing a rapid, openaccess, ‘one-stop’, outpatient-based vascular limb salvage clinic for adult patients with
suspected CLTI (including patients with DFUs). The primary aim of the clinic was to reduce
time from referral to treatment and improve rates of major amputation.

The clinic is led by two vascular specialist nurses who manage referrals and complete initial
patient assessment. A dedicated vascular scientist works within the clinic to perform lower
limb arterial duplex ultrasonography. Assessments are available for up to four patients per
day, Monday-Friday. The clinic also has access to reserved, fast-track CTA (same-day) and
rapid-access to angiography appointments for endovascular revascularisation.
Referral to the clinic is made via email, letter or telephone from any healthcare professional
managing a patient. The clinic offers an ‘open access’ policy and as such clinical suspicion of
CLTI is the only referral criterion. Patients may also self-refer directly to the clinic. The
clinic was designed to cover the Leicestershire and Rutland region of the United Kingdom
(approximately 1.1 million individuals), however referrals from outside this area are also
accepted. Prior to opening, a series of regional talks were held to advertise the clinic to both
primary and secondary healthcare providers and commissioners. The clinic has also received
coverage from regional television press.
On initial consultation patients undergo detailed history and examination, formulated in line
with contemporary guidelines.10 All patients undergo ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI)
measurement, with toe-brachial pressure index (TBPI) undertaken if incompressible. Arterial
duplex ultrasonography is subsequently performed when ABPI/TBPI is abnormal or if
clinical suspicion of CLTI remains, imaging from the common femoral artery (including
aorto-iliac inflow if indicated) to pedal arch outflow. A Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS)
WIfi (wound, ischaemia, foot infection)22 score is also recorded and converted into stages to
define the risk of major amputation (stage 1=very low risk, 2=low risk, 3=moderate risk,
4=high risk)
Following initial assessment all patients are reviewed in the same consultation by a
consultant vascular surgeon to confirm the diagnosis and instigate a management plan.
Endovascular procedures are predominantly undertaken under local anaesthetic on an

expedited outpatient basis, with patients requiring open or hybrid procedures also able to
undergo expedited pre-operative assessment and planning as an outpatient. When required,
patients can be admitted to facilitate treatment, with all clinical decisions discussed in a daily
team meeting involving vascular surgeons, vascular specialist nurses and allied health
professionals. In case of complex revascularisation or management decision, patients can be
discussed in a weekly MDT meeting (involving vascular surgeons, vascular nurse specialists,
interventional radiologists, anaesthetists, and if required, specialists from diabetology and
internal medicine). Where appropriate, medical interventions (i.e. antiplatelet and lipid
lowering agents) are commenced and education is provided regarding risk factor
modification. If no immediate intervention is required, patients are discharged back to the
referring clinician or routine follow-up in vascular outpatient clinic is arranged.
Given the operational hours of the clinic, the emergency admission pathway is available for
emergency out-of-hours referrals. As part of the continuing development of the service,
weekly clinics running in collaboration with diabetology and podiatry will commenced in
2020.
Study design and population
A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained clinic database was undertaken. All
consecutive patients diagnosed with CLTI within the VaLS clinic between 7th February 2018
(inception date) and 6th February 2019 were included. In keeping with local policy, all
patients diagnosed with a DFU (irrespective of PAD status) were also included. Patients were
defined as having a diagnosis of CLTI based upon clinical history (tissue loss or rest/night
pain for >2 weeks) in conjunction with objective evidence of PAD (equivalent of SVS WIfi
ischaemia grade >1). Patients with diabetes were defined as having a neuropathic DFU if they
had ulceration of the foot without objective evidence of PAD and did not undergo
revascularisation. These patients formed the ‘VaLS Clinic’ (VaLS) cohort.

To provide context, patients managed within VaLS were compared to two comparator
cohorts. Firstly, all patients managed for CLTI and/or DFU from the time of departmental
DFU policy change to the inception of the clinic (1st May 2017 - 6th February 2018), termed
the ‘Pre-Clinic’ (PC) cohort. Secondly, all patients managed after inception of the clinic (7th
February 2018 - 6th February 2019) but via alternative care pathways (e.g. elective vascular
outpatient clinic, out of hours admission). This cohort was termed the ‘Alternative Pathways’
(AP) cohort.
Patients for both comparator cohorts were identified from searching Hospital Episode
Statistics (HES) data using combinations of ICD-10 (I70.20, I70.21, E10-14; atherosclerosis
of lower limbs with/without gangrene, diabetes mellitus) and OPCS-4 (X09.-X12.1;
major/minor lower limb amputation) codes. Data were cross-referenced with electronic
patient records and a local vascular registry (LVR) database to ensure accuracy and
completeness. Patients diagnosed with acute limb ischaemia, venous disease or nonatherosclerotic PAD were excluded.
Baseline data and outcomes
Baseline demographics including age, sex and comorbidities (hypertension, ischaemic heart
disease, prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack, diabetes mellitus) were collected. Where
available, SVS WIfi scores and medications at time of assessment (anti-platelet and lipid
lowering medications) were recorded. Referral dates and subsequent procedural data (first
attempted revascularisation following assessment, minor and major amputation) and
mortality were identified. A major amputation was defined as an amputation proximal to the
ankle joint. Patients were followed-up until 12 months post assessment, death or 9th October
2019 (whichever occurred first)

Major amputation at 12 months was defined as the primary outcomes of the study. Secondary
outcomes were amputation free-survival at 12 months and times-to-treatment (time from
assessment to first attempted revascularisation). While referral dates are collected
prospectively within the VaLS clinic, this information is not accurately available in retrospect
and therefore this was not assessed within the two comparative cohorts.
Statistical analysis
Continuous baseline variables and times-to-treatment were examined for normality using
histogram plots and presented as either means (with standard deviation (SD)) or medians
(with interquartile ranges [IQR]). Categorical variables are presented as frequencies (with
percentages). Comparison between cohorts was undertaken using Pearson’s chi-square,
Student’s-t or Mann-Whitney U-tests, as appropriate. All analyses were undertaken on a ‘per
patient’ basis, as such patients who underwent multiple assessments were analysed based
upon their first clinical assessment, and in the cohort in which this first assessment occurred.
Outcomes of major amputation were analysed irrespective the side of amputation.
Both the rate of major amputation and amputation-free survival were compared between the
VaLS, and APC and PC cohorts. Further analysis was also undertaken to compare the rates of
amputation outcomes of all patients assessed pre- (‘2017-18’) and post- (‘2018-19’) inception
of the VaLS clinic to evaluate the overall impact of the clinic on the vascular service at the
Leicester Vascular Institute.
Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and cohorts compared using the log-rank rest. Cox’s
proportional hazard models were also utilised to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). All baseline characteristics were tested for potential confounding
effect on major amputation and amputation-free survival through univariate analysis, with
those having a p<.1 included in a final adjusted (aHR) model to compare risk of amputation

outcomes between cohorts. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v25.0 (IBM
Corp., Armonk, USA). P-values <.05 were deemed statistically significant.
Approval for this service evaluation was granted by the University Hospital of Leicester NHS
Trust’s Clinical Audit department (reference 9665).

Results
VaLS Clinic
Two-hundred and ninety-four patients (n=299 cases) were referred to the VaLS clinic within
its first year of operation, of which 197 (67.0%) patients were diagnosed with CLTI and 25
with a neuropathic DFU (8.5%).
Of those with CLTI/DFU (n=222), 153 (68.9%) patients were male, with a median age of
74.0 [64.0-82.0] years. Complete SVS WIfi scores were recorded in 141 patients, with 67
(47.5%) patients having stage 3 or 4 disease. As expected, referrals from general practice and
loco-regional diabetic foot clinics were the leading sources of caseload into the clinic
(82.8%). Interestingly, antiplatelet and lipid lowering medications were only prescribed in 93
(47.2%) and 91 (46.2%) patients respectively with CLTI.
Of the 72 patients not diagnosed with CLTI and/or DFU, 63 had no evidence of PAD/DFU
and eight had venous disease. One further patient was referred to the clinic but did not attend
for assessment. No major amputations were subsequently recorded in these patients.
Outcomes following assessment are shown in Table 1. One-hundred and thirty-nine patients
(70.6% of those with CLTI) underwent revascularisation, with an endovascular-first strategy
(n=114, 82.0%) being the most common technique utilised. Twenty patients (9.0%)
underwent a major amputation during follow-up, of which five occurred in patients not
undergoing revascularisation (4=neuropathic DFU, 1=patient refused revascularisation).

Following referral, assessment occurred within a median of 2.1 [1.1-3.1] days and
subsequently from assessment on to revascularisation in 6.1 [3.9-11.1] days. Overall, the
median time from referral to revascularisation was 8.1 [6.1-14.3] days. In patients with
moderate to high risk of amputation (SVS WIfi score >3) median time from referral to
revascularisation was 8.2 [7.1-13.1] days.
Amputation outcomes
Four-hundred and seventy-seven consecutive patients were identified in the comparator
cohorts (PC= 252, AP= 225 patients), in addition to the 222 patients within the VaLS cohort.
Of these, 53 patients underwent assessment in multiple cohorts (VaLS=22 patients, AP=31
patients). Taking account of the cohort in which patients underwent their first assessment,
analysis of amputation outcomes was performed on 252 patients within the PC, 194 patients
within the AP and 200 patients within the VaLS cohorts. After adjustment for patients
undergoing multiple assessment, the final VaLS cohort was comparable to the original cohort
of 222 patients (Supplemental Table 1) Median follow-up was 365 [265.5-365] days.
Comparison of baseline characteristics between cohorts are shown in Table 2. Of note, a
higher proportion of patients within the VaLS cohort were managed for a neuropathic DFU,
compared to both comparator cohorts. The higher proportion of patients with a diagnosis of
hypertension was also identified between the VaLS and AP cohorts.
Outcomes of each cohort at 12 months are shown in Table 3. No significant differences in
revascularisation or minor amputation management strategy were observed between cohorts.
At 12 months, patients within the VaLS cohort were observed to have a significantly lower
rate of major amputation (9.5%), compared with both AP (19.6%, p=.004) and PC (19.4%,
p=.003) cohorts (Figure 2). This trend continued for the rate of amputation-free survival, with
significantly higher rates observed in the VaLS cohort (74.0%) compared to both the AP

(55.2%, p<.001) and PC (60.7%, p=.003) cohorts (Figure 3). Comparing all patients assessed
pre- and post-inception of the VaLS clinic, the rate of major amputation declined since
inception of the VaLS clinic (2017-18=19.4%, 2018-19=14.5%, p=.096), however the result
did not reach the threshold for statistical significance (Figure 4). No difference in the rate of
amputation free survival was observed between time points (2017-18=60.7%, 201819=64.7%, p=.303)
Univariate analysis (Supplemental Table 2) identified the baseline characteristics of age, sex
(male) and diagnosis (neuropathic DFU) as potentially being associated with risk major
amputation at 12 months and therefore these factors were entered into the final adjusted
model. Based upon this, the risk of major amputation was significantly lower within the
VaLS cohort, compared to both the AP (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.74, p=.003) and PC (aHR
0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78, p=.004) cohorts.
The association between baseline characteristics and risk of amputation-free survival are
shown in Supplemental Table 3. The combined risk of amputation or death (amputation-free
survival) was also significantly lower within the VaLS cohort compared to both the AP (aHR
0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.71, p<.001) and PC (aHR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87, p=.005) cohorts.
Comparing all patients assessed pre- and post-inception of the VaLS clinic, the risk of major
amputation at 12 months showed a signal towards benefit since inception of the clinic (aHR
0.74, 95% CI 0.50-1.09, p=.122), however the result was not statistically significant. No
difference in amputation-free survival was identified (aHR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69-1.16, p=.402;
risk of amputation or death).

Median times from assessment to treatment showed no significant difference between the
VaLS, and AP and PC cohorts, although the range of times was smallest in the VaLS cohort
(Table 4). Times from referral to assessment were not available for comparison.

Discussion
This study indicates that the implementation of a novel vascular limb salvage clinic can help
reduce the rate of major amputation and improve amputation-free survival. Furthermore,
these results demonstrate the ability of the clinic to provide timely vascular assessment and
consultant review following referral.
How care is provided to this group of patients is an area of growing importance, particularly
in light of the burgeoning prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its complications.23 The
provision of a vascular surgery service, which facilitates prompt assessment and
revascularisation is therefore a key aim of any department. Despite this, evidence suggests
time delays are common throughout the treatment pathway.3 While the causes of delays will
differ even between individual departments, removing unnecessary barriers between
healthcare specialities is appreciated as a key factor in providing timely care.4, 6
The concept of vascular limb salvage services has grown in prominence over the last decade
as a solution to this problem, providing seamless access to specialist vascular assessment,
revascularisation and surgical debridement (often referred to as the ‘toe-and-flow’ model).9, 24
The 2019 Global Vascular Guidelines10 provides further impetus by defining broad criteria
for limb salvage ‘centres of excellence’. Within the contemporary literature, examples of
services which meet these criteria are limited.11-21 Furthermore, individual models vary
greatly in scope, design and size; from individual ‘hot’ clinics specialising solely in DFUs, to
dedicated broad based multi-aetiology wound-care services.11,

Kingdom (UK), focussing on new models of care is highly relevant given the particularly
challenging time-to-treatment targets recently published within the new VSGBI PAD QIF.7
To the best of our knowledge, the Leicester VaLS clinic represents one of the first openaccess, outpatient based vascular limb salvage clinics, which principally manages patients
with CLTI, within the literature. Of particular benefit, this model of care provides a readily
reproducible and achievable limb salvage service, which utilises many existing resources
within a vascular department to help expedite the management pathway of patients with limb
ischaemia. The resultant streamlined service, particularly establishing rapid-access to
vascular assessment, can potentially help to significantly improve amputation outcomes for
patients. The experience of the clinic has also shown that having an ‘open-access’ policy does
not result in the clinic being overwhelmed by inappropriate referrals.
Whilst early results are encouraging, on-going evaluation of the clinic is required to help
overcome current and future challenges. Particular focus is necessary to help bring about
further improvement in the times-to-treatment. Average times from assessment to treatment
were comparable between the three cohorts, although lower than those reported within
similar studies.25, 26 Therefore, whilst the clinic meets the 14 days PAD QIF target time, in
patients with more severe disease (i.e. SVS WIfi stage 3 and 4) it still falls short of the fiveday deadline.
This can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, the ability of the outpatient clinic to achieve
comparable treatment times to those managed as inpatient, whilst helping to lower the rate of
major amputation is encouraging. This also confers potential financial benefit through
reduced use of costly inpatient services. Furthermore, the clinic provides a thorough,
outpatient-based vascular assessment and consultant review within just two days of referral.

The comparability of treatment times is however somewhat surprising given the clinic was
designed to have access to dedicated radiology appointments for CT imaging and
angiography. In part this may reflect current departmental service provision, with the clinic
not currently opening at weekends and only emergency revascularisation procedures being
performed outside of ‘normal working’ hours. The resultant effect is to potentially delay
treatment in a proportion of patients upwards of 48 hours. Given the challenge of meeting the
PAD QIF targets, consideration is currently being given to extending the VaLS clinic to a 7day per week service. Furthermore, providing greater capacity for non-emergency weekend
operating, as recommended in the recent speciality ‘Getting It Right First Time’ (GIRFT)27
report, may help reduce times–to-treatment. This remains challenging however in light of
ongoing resource constraints and workforce shortages in the National Health Service.28
Other results are also worthy of mention. Interestingly, less than 50% of patients with CLTI
within the VaLS cohort had been prescribed anti-platelet or lipid lowering secondary
preventative medications at the time of assessment. It has long been established that the
medical management of PAD is suboptimal, within both primary and secondary care
setting.29,

30

These prescription rates are comparable to a recent multi-centred, audit of

secondary care practice within the UK and further highlight the important need to improve
the medical management of patients with CLTI.31
The study also identified that a significantly higher proportion of patients within the VaLS
cohort were managed for neuropathic DFU, compared to both comparator cohorts. This may
reflect the close working relationship between loco-regional diabetic foot services and the
VaLS clinic, and an increasing tendency to refer patients to the clinic for vascular assessment
who may not otherwise be referred. Furthermore, the relative infancy of the hospital’s DFU
policy and low threshold for revascularisation may explain the lower than expected numbers
being managed solely for a neuropathic DFU.

Strengths and limitations
In comparison with similar articles reporting outcomes of limb salvage services, this study
has two particular strengths. Unlike many articles, this study provides comparative
institutional data in order to provide context to the results and demonstrate benefits to
outcomes.13, 14, 17, 20, 21 This study also provides time-to-event data and is the first to analyse
times within treatment pathways.11, 18
Limitation however exist. Firstly, there is the potential for selection and performance bias,
particularly regarding patients seen within the VaLS clinic. Whilst baseline characteristics
and treatment strategies were broadly comparable, there is potential that clinic patients had an
intrinsically lower risk of amputation. Likewise, decisions on treatments could have been
systematically different, with a higher threshold for amputation taken within the clinic
compared to the AP and PC cohorts.
In part this is inherent in any pragmatic analysis of a healthcare service. Although SVS WIfi
scores are available for a proportion of patients within the VaLS cohort, this information
cannot be accurately derived through retrospective data collection. To help mitigate this,
analysis of all patients assessed pre- and post-inception of the clinic was undertaken, however
results must be interpreted with some degree of caution.
Secondly, the study relied on the accuracy and completeness of HES data and electronic
patient records. This was especially important in the context of case ascertainment,
identification of patient characteristics and establishing outcomes. Whilst broadly validated,
HES data is not without drawbacks including variation in coding between institutions and
missing data.32 Furthermore, electronic records do not accurately store referral details or
medication use at the time of assessment, thus preventing the comparison of these factors. To
some extent these effects were moderated by cross checking data with LVR records, however

the inability to compare referral times limits the study’s capacity to show definitive
improvement since inception of the clinic.
Lastly is the issue of patient cross-over between cohorts. Whilst not unexpected given the
nature of CLTI and the high rate of re-intervention associated with the condition, this crossover is problematic.33 To help manage this, outcomes were assessed on an ‘intention-to-treat’
basis, with patients analysed within the cohort of their first assessment. Therefore, this has
the potential of biasing the results in favour of more contemporary patients. The effects of
this could have been reduced by selecting comparative cases (namely the PC cohort) from a
more distant time-point, however given the major changes to local policies before May 2017,
this would have affected the comparability of the cohorts.

Conclusions
The inception of a limb salvage clinic can help to reduce the rate of major amputation for
patients with CLTI and provides a model of care which can deliver timely specialist vascular
assessment. Whilst early outcomes are promising, further evaluation is required to assess
longer-term outcomes and continue to reduce times-to-treatment.
