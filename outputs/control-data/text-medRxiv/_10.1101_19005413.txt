ABSTRACT

2

Background: The rising prevalence of childhood obesity is a global public health concern. Evidence

3

suggests that exposure to non-parental childcare before age six years is associated with increased

4

risk of obesity, diet, and activity behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep).

5

However, findings are inconsistent and mostly from cross-sectional studies, making it difficult to

6

identify the direction of causation in associations. This review identified and synthesised the published

7

research on longitudinal associations between non-parental childcare during early childhood, diet, and

8

activity behaviours.

9

Methods: Seven databases were searched using a predefined search strategy. Results were

10

independently double-screened through title/abstract and full-text stages according to predefined

11

criteria. Included studies were tabulated, and evaluated for risk of bias using the Nutrition Evidence

12

Library Bias Assessment Tool.

13

Results: Of 18793 references screened, 13 studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the

14

review. Eight studies reported on diet and seven studies reported on activity behaviour outcomes

15

(three on physical activity, three on sedentary behaviour, and one on sleep). These studies included

16

results on 89 tested childcare:outcome associations. Of 63 associations testing diet outcomes, 37

17

(59%) were null, and the remainder showed inconsistent patterns. There was an indication of a

18

potential benefit of Head Start providers (vs other care, including parental) on dietary behaviours. Of

19

26 associations testing activity behaviour outcomes, 22 (85%) were null, and the remainder were

20

inconsistent. Most studies (92%) did not use (or did not report using) valid and reliable outcome

21

measures, and outcome assessors were not blinded (or it was unclear if they were blinded) to

22

children’s exposure status (77%).

23

Conclusions: The scarce available literature indicates little and mixed evidence of a longitudinal

24

association between exposure to non-parental childcare before age six years and diet or activity

25

behaviours. This reflects a paucity of research, rather than clear evidence of no effect. There is an

26

urgent need for studies investigating the longitudinal associations of non-parental childcare on diet

27

and activity behaviours to assess potential lasting effects and mechanisms. Studies should assess

28

whether and how associations vary by provider and child sub-groups, as well as differences by

29

intensity and duration of care.

BACKGROUND

36

High rates of childhood obesity are a worldwide concern (1, 2). Globally in 2016, approximately 40.6

37

million (6%) children under 5 years of age were overweight or obese (1), an increase of over one third

38

from 30.4 million in 2000 (1). Obesity during childhood is associated with increased risk of both

39

obesity and a range of other conditions later in life, including low self-esteem, high blood pressure,

40

insulin resistance, coronary heart disease and stroke (3-5) . The early years (<6 years of age) have

41

been repeatedly highlighted as a critical period for the development and prevention of obesity (4, 6,

42

7), as well as the establishment of related healthy habits, such as healthy diet, physical activity, and

43

sleep patterns (8, 9). Several individual, inter-personal and environmental factors influence the

44

development of childhood obesity (10). Because they affect large numbers of children, environmental

45

factors such as childcare settings represent potential targets for obesity prevention (11, 12).

46

An increasing number of children now attend non-parental childcare prior to 6 years of age, and many

47

spend large proportions of their week days in such care (13, 14). A report by the United Nations’

48

Children’s Emergency Fund shows that roughly 80% of 3–6 year olds and 25% of 0–3 year olds in

49

developed countries spend time in some form of childcare (14). A growing body of research, including

50

a number of systematic reviews, suggests that attendance at childcare is associated with increased

51

adiposity or risk of obesity in children (15-17). However, the available evidence is inconsistent (15, 16,

52

18, 19), and may partly depend on different aspects of the childcare received, such as the type (i.e.,

53

informal or formal care) or intensity (e.g., number of hours per week).

54

The pathways through which non-parental childcare might affect obesity are poorly understood (20,

55

21). Different types and characteristics of childcare settings may have different influences on the

56

development of obesity-related risk factors, such as diet and activity behaviours (including physical

57

activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep) (12, 22-25). Evidence suggests that some types of non-

58

parental childcare (e.g., grandparents or Head Start in the US) and staff behaviours (e.g., giving non-

59

food rewards and allowing children to self-serve) are associated with diet patterns and behaviours

60

(24, 26). Similarly, different types (e.g., home-based versus centre-based settings) and features (e.g.,

61

staff behaviours like playing with children) of childcare are associated with physical activity (27-30)

62

and sedentary behaviour (23, 30, 31) in young children. There is also some evidence that attending

63

some types of childcare is associated with problematic sleeping patterns in young children (22, 25,

64

32). However, the direction of these associations is mixed, and associations are not consistently

65

found in all population sub-groups or studies. Additionally, the vast majority of the current evidence

66

comes from cross-sectional studies, which makes it difficult to determine the direction of causation.

67

The aim of this review was to systematically gather and synthesise the published research on the

68

longitudinal relationship between non-parental childcare in the early years and diet, physical activity,

69

sedentary behaviour, and sleep. We focused exclusively on longitudinal studies to increase

70

confidence that any association we find might be causal.

71

72

METHODS

73

This review was part of a larger programme of systematic reviews (including obesity and stress

74

outcomes alongside the diet and activity behaviour outcomes reported here) that was registered with

75

the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42015027233) (33), and reported in line with the

76

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) recommendations

77

(34). The protocol for the overall programme of systematic reviews has been published elsewhere

78

(35).

79

80

Search Strategy

81

Seven electronic bibliographic databases were searched in January 2016, using a predefined search

82

strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, Applied Social Sciences Index

83

and Abstracts (ASSIA), and the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO). Searches were

84

restricted to human subjects, but there were no restrictions placed on publication date or language.

85

The search strategy was based on the key themes of relevance to the overall review as described in

86

the protocol – childcare, adiposity and body mass, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, diet,

87

and stress – and informed by search strategies of relevant previous systematic reviews (36). An

88

experienced university librarian (VP) reviewed the search strategy, adapted it for different databases,

89

and ran the searches. An example of the search strategy used for the MEDLINE and Embase

databases can be found in Supplement 1. Results were merged from the different databases and

91

managed using EndNote® software. The searches were re-run at the end of May 2017.

92

93

Study Selection and eligibility criteria

94

After removal of duplicates, records were screened in two phases using a pre-piloted procedure (Box

95

1). In phase one, title and abstracts were screened by two reviewers working independently against

96

the five phase one eligibility criteria described in Figure 1. The full texts of all studies identified by

97

either reviewer as potentially eligible were retrieved. In phase two, full texts were screened by two

98

reviewers working independently against the seven phase two eligibility criteria described in Figure 1.

99

In cases of uncertainty or discrepancy between reviewers, we consulted a third reviewer and

100

consensus was achieved by discussion.

101

102

Figure 1 – Eligibility criteria

103

104

The number of papers included and excluded at each stage of the review process can be seen in the

105

PRISMA diagram presented in Figure 2. The diagram shows overall number of references screened

106

and excluded (by reason) instead of number of references by outcome of interest, because eligibility

107

at full-text screening (phase two) was done for all six outcomes of interest in the registered protocol

108

for the programme of systematic reviews (obesity, stress, diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour

109

and sleep) (33). Concurrently, the final number of included studies are presented for behaviour

110

outcomes only that were the focus of the current review – diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour,

111

and sleep.

Details of and justification for each eligibility criteria are described in full in the protocol (35). Studies

116

were included where participants were children aged <6 years and not in primary school at first

117

assessment, and living in middle- and high-income countries as defined by the World Bank (37). Only

118

observational longitudinal study designs, including case-control, prospective, and retrospective

119

designs, were included. The exposure of interest was non-parental childcare where there was

120

between-child variation in exposure, for example by timing of attendance (i.e., age when care started

121

and stopped), intensity (i.e., full- or part-time care), duration (i.e., years of childcare), types (i.e.,

122

formal or informal; private or public), or simply attendance versus non-attendance. Studies were

123

included where outcomes were objectively assessed or proxy/self-reported measures of diet, physical

124

activity, sedentary behaviour, or sleep. Studies were excluded if they were not published in peer-

125

reviewed journals.

126

When the team could not resolve issues of whether eligibility criteria were met, study authors were

127

contacted via email for clarification. If authors did not reply by the end of the data extraction stage,

128

studies were excluded from the review. Conference abstracts, masters and doctoral theses were

129

excluded, as these do not necessarily go through a formal peer-review process. Nevertheless, the

130

authors of any potentially relevant records of these types of references were contacted via email to

131

determine if peer-reviewed journal articles had resulted, and screened articles identified through this

132

route according to the phase two process above.

133

134

Data Extraction and Management

135

A standardised and pre-piloted form was used to extract data from included studies for assessment of

136

study quality and evidence synthesis. This captured information about study setting and population,

137

exposure and outcome variables, statistical analyses and results, as stated in the protocol (35). The

138

first author extracted these data into an Excel® database, and a second author (JA/SBN)

139

independently checked the extracted information against the full-texts of included studies.

140

141

Data Synthesis

142

Key information was tabulated (e.g., sample characteristics, exposure, and outcome measures) for

143

each study, grouped by outcome variable, and performed a narrative synthesis of the included

144

studies. Because of heterogeneity in exposure and outcome variables, it was not appropriate to

145

perform a meta-analysis. This also meant that it was not possible, as originally planned, to perform a

146

quantitative synthesis of differences in effect between different types and features of childcare,

147

different outcomes, high- and middle-income countries, ages at exposure, and socio-demographic

148

sub-groups (e.g., by ethnicity). Instead, and because of the sometimes large number of relevant

exposure and outcome variables used in included studies, all individual relevant associations reported

150

Quality Assessment

153

An adaptation of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Nutrition Evidence Library Bias

154

Assessment Tool (NEL-BAT) (38) was used to assess risk of bias in included studies. This tool

155

assesses risk of selection, performance, detection, and attrition bias. For observational studies,

156

responses to each of the 13 questions are scored 0–2 (possible range of scores: 0–26), where lower

157

scores indicate lower risk of bias. SC and JA independently assessed all included studies for risk of

158

bias, and disagreements in scores were resolved by discussion.

159

160

RESULTS

161

The literature search identified 47 529 articles. After de-duplication, 18 793 articles underwent

162

title/abstract screening, and the full texts of 175 articles were reviewed. Thirteen studies (39-51) met

163

all of the eligibility criteria, and were included in the review. Of these, eight studies reported on diet

164

(39, 45-51), three reported on physical activity (39, 41, 44), three on sedentary behaviour (41-43), and

165

one on sleep (40) outcomes. Some studies reported on more than one of diet, physical activity,

166

sedentary behaviour and sleep.

167

168

Summary of Included Studies

169

A detailed description of each study’s characteristics can be seen in Table 1. Most included studies

170

were from high-income countries, with seven originating from the United States (39, 40, 42, 43), one

171

from Australia (41), one from New Zealand (44), and one from the UK (48). Samples were generally

172

balanced with relation to children’s gender (although three studies did not report gender composition

173

of the sample) (47, 48, 51), but varied greatly both in size (between 34 and 18 050 subjects) and

174

ethnic composition (between 0% and 87% white, with one study not reporting race/ethnicity or country

175

of birth (41), and five providing information only for country of birth) (45, 46, 48, 49, 51).

179

All studies assessed exposure to non-parental childcare between birth and 5 years. Measurement of

180

exposure was by proxy-report from a parent or primary caregiver in all studies. Nine studies described

181

childcare exposure in simple categorical terms (e.g., centre-based preschool or Head Start centre

182

versus other/mixed care, including parents) (39-41, 45, 46, 48-51). One study assessed duration of

183

exposure (centre-based preschool for at least 2 years versus other/mixed care, including parents)

184

(39). Five studies assessed intensity of non-parental childcare (e.g., average number of hours in

185

childcare between 24-36 months) (42-44, 47, 48).

186

Age at outcome assessment varied from 1-12 months to 51 years. For diet outcomes, all studies used

187

proxy-report by a mother or main caregiver (39, 45-51). For physical activity outcomes, most studies

188

used proxy- or self-report (39, 41, 44), with the exception of average accelerometer counts/minute in

189

one case (44). All studies assessing sedentary behaviour outcomes (e.g., hours/day of television (TV)

190

viewing) using proxy-report by a parent. For sleep, quantitative outcomes (e.g., nap durations) were

191

measured objectively by an accelerometer, whereas qualitative outcomes (e.g., difficulty going to bed

192

or falling asleep) were subjectively measured by parent-report (40).

193

No two studies used the same outcome variables. All diet studies presented outcomes as categorical

194

variables, with three studies investigating breastfeeding related outcomes (e.g., breastfeeding ≥4

195

months) (47, 48, 51), four studies investigating consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods (e.g.

196

consuming sweetened beverages, salty snacks, or fruits/vegetables) (39, 45, 46, 50), and one study

197

investigating between-meal eating (49). Two studies presented physical activity outcomes as

198

categorical variables (e.g., high, medium, and low physical activity level versus sedentary) (39, 41),

199

whereas one study used continuous variables (e.g., average accelerometer counts per minute). All

200

sedentary behaviour variables were categorical (e.g., >4 versus ≤4 hours/day of TV viewing), and two

201

out of three studies used TV viewing as a proxy for sedentary behaviour. There was a wide range of

202

sleep variables, from number and duration of naps to variables relating to the quality of sleep.

203

Four studies investigated only one exposure and one outcome variable (41-43, 47). The remainder

204

explored several outcome (40) or exposure variables (39, 44). Thus, the eight included studies

205

reported on 63 associations between non-parental childcare and diet outcomes, nine associations

206

with physical activity outcomes, three associations with sedentary behaviour outcomes, and 15

207

associations with sleep outcomes. Nine studies employed analytical strategies that accounted for

208

potential confounding effects of other variables (i.e., multivariable regression models) (39, 41, 45-51),

209

8 of which investigated diet outcomes, whereas the remainder used simple statistical tests which did

210

not account for potential confounding factors (40, 42-44). In the majority of cases, this was because

211

the association between childcare and physical activity, sedentary behaviour or sleep was not the

212

main focus on the paper.

213

214

Synthesis of Findings

215

Table 2 presents detailed results for all relevant associations explored in each study.

216

217

Diet

218

Eight studies evaluated the longitudinal relationship between non-parental childcare during early

219

childhood and diet outcomes (39, 45-51). Results were highly mixed. Lee et al (46) reported that

220

children who attended Head Start settings at 4 years of age showed significantly higher frequency of

221

healthy eating patterns at 5-6 years of age than those attending other settings (all p<0.05), except

222

Pre-Kindergarten. Conversely, no differences in frequency of unhealthy eating patterns were found

223

between the groups (46). Another study assessing attendance at Head Start (39) found that children

224

who attended Head Start or other centre-based childcare at 4 years of age (irrespective of length of

225

exposure) were more likely to report frequent fruit consumption than those in other/mixed care

226

(including parental care) at age 5-6 years. In this study, children who attended other (non-Head Start)

227

centre-base childcare were also less likely to regularly consume soda at age 5-6 years than those in

228

other/mixed care (all p<0.05). However, other centre-base childcare was also associated with higher

229

likelihood of regular consumption of chips (p<0.05). There was no difference in the likelihood of

230

regular consumption of fast-food, candy, and chips consumption, and frequent consumption of

231

vegetables between those attending Head Start or other centre-based childcare (irrespective of length

232

of exposure) versus other/mixed care (including parental care).

233

Similarly, Wasser et al (50) also reported mixed findings. They found that children in any non-

234

maternal childcare had higher odds of consuming whole fruit (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.15, p<0.05), and

235

juice (any childcare OR: 1.51; Grandparents OR: 1.91, p<0.05) than those in maternal care. But there

236

was no association between childcare (overall or by type) and consumption of five other food and

237

drinks including vegetables and salty snacks. Camara et al (45) also reported mostly null associations

238

between childcare and the two dietary patterns investigated, except a higher adherence to a

239

processed/fast-food pattern at 2-5 years of age in those being cared for at home by someone other

240

than the mother compared to those cared for by their mother (B= 0.70 (SE:0.14), p<0.001) at 2-3

241

years of age. Sata et al’s (49) reported more frequent between meal eating before dinner at age 6

242

years in those cared for by grandparents and nursery/kindergarten than those cared for by mothers,

243

as well as between meal eating ≥3 times per day those cared for by grandparents versus those cared

244

for by mothers at 3 years of age. However, no other associations were found with any care at 12 or

245

22 years of age.

246

Three studies investigated breastfeeding outcomes (47, 48, 51), showing mixed results. Pearce et al

247

(48) reported lower likelihood of breastfeeding for ≥4 months in children attending informal compared

248

to parental care (independent of attending full- or part-time, lone parenthood, or area of deprivation),

249

but mixed results for those attending formal care. For example, in the analyses stratified by family

250

structure, children living in single parent families receiving formal care were more likely to be

251

breastfed for ≥4 months (Risk ratio (RR)= 1.65) than those being cared for by parents, but the reverse

252

was true for children living in couple families (RR= 0.79, all p<0.05). While Weille et al (51) reported a

253

higher risk of changing from mostly breastfed to mostly or solely formula-fed in those attending

254

childcare compared to those cared for at home (RR= 2.05 to 2.50, p<0.05), Levy et al (47) found an

255

increased risk of earlier cessation of breastfeeding in children who used pacifier and did not attend

256

any childcare and those who attended 15 days of childcare between 0-6 months of age versus those

257

not attending childcare and not using pacifier.

258

259

Overall, the eight included studies tested 63 associations between non-parental childcare exposures

260

and diet outcomes. Of these, 37 (59%) were null, 10 (16%) indicated significant beneficial effects of

261

non-parental care on dietary behaviours, seven (11%) indicated significant detrimental effects of non-

262

parental care on dietary behaviours, one (2%) found significant association with a diet behaviour that

263

is of unsure detrimental effect (between-meal snacking) (49), and eight (13%) found mixed results, As

264

an example of the latter, when investigating associations by maternal education, Pearce et al. (48)

265

reported that those in informal care had significantly lower odds of being breastfed ≥4 months versus

266

those in parental care, but only when parents had GCSE D-G or lower education. At the same time,

267

those in formal care also had significantly lower odds of being breastfed ≥4 months versus those in

268

parental care, but only when parents had degree-level education (48).

270

Physical Activity

271

Three studies evaluated the longitudinal relationship between childcare during early childhood and

272

physical activity outcomes (39, 41, 44). Results were highly mixed. Belfield & Kelly (39) found that

273

children who attended Head Start at 4 years old had significantly lower physical activity levels in

274

kindergarten than those who received parental care. However, there was no difference in physical

275

activity between those attending other centre-based care versus parental care, irrespective of length

276

of exposure to such care. Conversely, D’Onise et al (41) reported that those attending Kindergarten

277

Union preschool between 2 and 4 years old were more likely to be in the high physical activity level

278

group (versus sedentary group) at around age 45 years than those who did not attend this preschool.

279

In the only study looking at intensity of childcare use, Taylor et al (44) found no significant

280

associations between weekly hours of childcare attendance at 3 or 4 years old and objectively

281

measured physical activity 1 or 2 years later.

282

Overall, the six included studies tested nine associations between non-parental childcare exposures

283

and physical activity outcomes. Of these, seven (78%) were null (39, 44), whereas two (22%) found

284

significant differences but in competing directions, with one showing childcare to be associated with

285

more, and one with less physical activity (39, 41).

286

287

Sedentary Behaviour

288

Three studies evaluated the longitudinal relationship between childcare during early childhood and

289

sedentary behaviour outcomes (41-43), including one study that conceptualised sedentary behaviour

290

as the absence of physical activity (also reported on above) (41). As noted, D’Onise et al (41)

291

reported that those who attended Kindergarten Union preschool between ages 2 and 4 years were

292

less likely to be in the sedentary group (versus the high physical activity level group) at around 45

293

years, than those who did not attend this preschool. The remaining two studies (42, 43) found no

294

significant associations between number of hours per week of childcare at 24-36 months and 3-5

295

years and subsequent daily hour of television viewing at 36 months and 6-12 years respectively.

296

Thus, three associations between non-parental childcare and sedentary behaviour were tested in

297

included studies. Two (67%) were null (42, 43), and one (33%) showed a significant association

298

between childcare and lower risk of sedentary behaviour (41).

Sleep

301

The only study investigating the longitudinal relationship between childcare and sleep outcomes

302

yielded mixed results (40). Cairns and Harsh (40) reported that those attending all day preschool or

303

day care at age 5 years (versus a primary/secondary caregiver) transitioned to earlier sleep onset and

304

wake up time on week days in the first months of preschool. The authors are clear that the health

305

implications of these differences are unknown. There were no differences between the groups in any

306

other variables (e.g., difficulty in going to bed and nocturnal sleep duration on week days).

307

Overall, 15 associations between non-parental childcare and sleep outcomes were tested in this

308

single included study. The majority (n=13) were null, with only two showing significant results. The

309

health implications of these are unknown.

Quality Evaluation

314

Risk of bias scores ranged from 1-12 out of a total maximum of 26 (with lower scores indicating lower

315

risk of bias) (see Table 3). The most common sources of bias were not reporting or using valid and

316

reliable outcome measures (NEL-BAT question 13; 12 studies), and outcome assessors not blinded

317

(or not clear whether they were blinded) to the intervention or exposure status of participants (NEL-

318

BAT question 12; 10 studies). There was low risk of bias throughout in terms of inclusion and

319

exclusion criteria (question 2), recruitment strategy (question 2), accounting for variations in the

320

execution of the study from the proposed protocol or research plan (question 7), and length of follow-

321

up across study groups (question 14).

DISCUSSION

326

Summary of findings

327

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to investigate the longitudinal relationship

328

between non-parental childcare before age 6 years and diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour

329

and sleep. Overall, the evidence base is very limited with only 13 studies meeting eligibility criteria. In

330

total, eight studies reported on diet outcomes, three on physical activity, three on sedentary behaviour

331

and one on sleep. Included studies varied widely in terms of definition and measurement of both

332

exposure and outcomes, and lacked in-depth exploration of different aspects of childcare that may

333

influence any relationship with the outcomes studied. The available, limited, longitudinal literature

334

suggests that attending certain types of non-parental childcare (particularly informal providers) might

335

be related to less breastfeeding, but the evidence regarding other dietary outcomes is mixed, and

336

sometimes contradictory. Moreover, the data reviewed suggests that attending non-parental childcare

337

is unrelated to physical activity, sedentary behaviour or sleep outcomes. Included studies were of

338

mixed quality with most (92%) not reporting using valid and reliable outcome measures, and few

339

(23%) including blinding of outcome assessors to participants’ exposure status.

340

341

Strengths and limitations of studies included in the review

342

The measurement of exposure to childcare in included studies was highly variable. Some studies

343

focused on one particular type of childcare provider (e.g., attending Kindergarten Union) (41) versus a

344

reference group that was an amalgam of all other types (39-41). Other studies included only the

345

number of hours per week in non-parental childcare (42-44). Only four studies explored differences

346

between the type of childcare provider (45, 48-50), but no studies performed detailed analyses

347

exploring differences by duration, intensity, and timing of childcare. Thus, we were unable to explore

348

differing effects according to these characteristics of childcare, as originally intended.

349

Similarly, there was substantial heterogeneity in how outcomes were assessed in included studies,

350

which did not allow for direct comparisons. Apart from Cairns & Harsh’s study (40), no study reported

351

validity or reliability of the methods used for measuring outcomes. Concurrently, the common use of

352

proxy-report measures of diet, physical activity, sedentary and sleep behaviour outcomes increases

353

the risk of measurement error and bias (e.g., overestimating physical activity and underestimating

354

sedentary behaviour).

355

Only seven (54%) studies used an adequate analytical framework that accounted for the potential

356

complexity of the relationship between non-parental childcare and outcomes (physical activity in both

357

cases) (39, 41, 45, 48-50), by including and statistically adjusting for potential confounding and

358

mediating variables. Thus, the evidence base may be substantially compromised by uncontrolled

359

confounding by factors such as family and socioeconomic characteristics. Furthermore, apart from

360

Pearce et al’s (48) study focusing on breastfeeding, no other study explored variations in any

361

relationships between exposures and outcomes according to contextual factors, such as maternal

362

education or socioeconomic status. Thus, we were not able to report on these, as originally proposed

363

in the protocol (33). Failure to adjust for confounding variables is often a result of the association

364

between childcare and health behaviours not being the primary focus of the study. Greater attention

365

to these associations as primary aims of studies is required to increase the strength of available

366

evidence.

367

368

Strengths and limitations of the review

369

This systematic review has several strengths. A large number and variety of databases were

370

searched using a comprehensive search strategy designed in partnership with an experienced

371

librarian (VP), without limits on date of publication or language. Independent double screening was

372

used at both abstract and full-text screening stages, and a third reviewer was included to resolve any

373

inconsistencies in these processes, reducing risk of researcher bias. In cases of remaining

374

uncertainty, study authors were contacted. The risk of bias assessment (NEL-BAT) was also

375

performed independently in duplicate. This review focused on longitudinal studies because these

376

provide a better indication of causality between exposure and outcomes than cross-sectional studies

377

(52).

378

However, there are a number of limitations that need highlighting. The low number of studies for each

379

of the outcomes did not allow us to present a summary of findings table as advised by the Cochrane

380

Library Handbook, nor to perform a meta-analyses as planned (33). Heterogeneity in the study

381

designs, definition of exposure and outcomes, and the methods and measurement tools used also

382

made comparisons difficult; therefore, data were narratively synthesized and described. The results

383

cannot be generalised to middle-income countries, as all studies were located in high-income

384

countries. Furthermore, it was not possible to determine if associations persisted or emerged later,

385

because only two articles and four (4%) associations had outcomes that were measured after

386

childhood (41, 49); the remaining 11 articles and 85 (96%) associations assessed outcomes that were

387

measured during childhood only (0-12 years).

389

Interpretation of findings

390

Overall, there were substantial null results with a few scattered and mostly inconsistent statistically

391

significant associations between non-parental childcare and diet, physical activity, sedentary

392

behaviour and sleep outcomes. There was an indication that attending Head Start settings might be

393

associated with positive dietary behaviours compared to other/mixed care (including parental care)

394

(39, 46). However, this evidence comes from only from two studies (39, 46), and was not seen across

395

all dietary outcomes studied (e.g., there was an association with more frequent fruit but not vegetable

396

consumption) (39), or in relation to all other childcare types (e.g., no significant difference in healthy

397

eating patterns between Head Start and state-funded pre-kindergarten programmes). Few consistent

398

findings were found for physical activity, sedentary behaviour or sleep.

399

Whilst cross-sectional studies generally find more evidence of an unhealthy effect of childcare on diet

400

and activity behaviours (22, 23, 26, 28, 30, 53, 54), this does not appear to be reflected in the limited

401

available longitudinal data. It is possible that any cross-sectional relationship does not persist

402

longitudinally and, hence, that there is no long-term impact of childcare on diet and activity

403

behaviours. This would suggest that identified longitudinal associations between childcare and

404

adiposity occurs via other mechanisms, such as stress. Alternatively, and maybe more likely, the

405

quality and quantity of the longitudinal evidence available on the relationship between childcare and

406

diet and activity behaviours is not strong enough to draw conclusions on the presence or nature of

407

any relationship.

408

Most included studies measured outcomes in childhood, up to age 12 years, only (39, 40, 42-44). It is

409

possible that any effects of childcare on diet and activity behaviours emerge later in life – particularly

410

when children start to develop into more independent adolescents and adults. Although not enough to

411

corroborate it, the significant associations found in D’Onise et al’s study (41), where physical activity

412

level was assessed during mid-adulthood, support the plausibility of that hypothesis at least for

413

activity behaviours.

414

The wide range of different outcome and exposure measures used in the included studies indicates

415

poor theorisation and conceptualisation of any potential association. In general, there is limited

416

evidence of shared understanding of exactly what aspect of childcare is expected to be associated

417

with exactly what aspect of diet or type of activity behaviour, what the direction of such associations

418

is, and why. Furthermore, authors rarely addressed the many dimensions that can vary in the

15

419

exposure to non-parental childcare in terms of provider, timing, duration and intensity (particularly in

420

relation to the activity behaviours outcomes). Greater conceptual clarity in these areas may help drive

421

stronger longitudinal investigations. Clearer disentanglement of all of the potential dimensions in

422

which exposure to childcare may vary will help identify if there are more and less healthful ways in

423

which children can receive childcare.

424

Although it was not possible to perform meta-analyses or meta-regressions, there is no obvious

425

indication that results were related to study size, whether outcomes were considered as continuous

426

and categorical variables, whether outcomes were measured using subjective or objective methods,

427

and whether studies were prospective or retrospective. However, the very small number of studies

428

included for each outcome makes it difficult to draw conclusions on these issues.

429

430

Implications for policy, practice and research

431

Although overall there was little evidence of a longitudinal relationship between childcare and diet and

432

physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep, this more likely represents a current absence of high

433

quality evidence, rather than good evidence of absence of an effect. Given this, it is difficult to draw

434

any firm implications for policy and practice. Nevertheless, and given that there is some evidence of

435

an association between childcare and adiposity,(15-17) it would be prudent for those regulating and

436

providing childcare to continue to consider how they can provide a healthful environment for the

437

children in their care.

438

The small number of studies included in the current review highlights the need for more longitudinal

439

studies investigating the relationship between non-parental childcare and diet, physical activity,

440

sedentary behaviour and sleep. These studies should employ valid and reliable measures of both

441

exposure and outcomes; analytical frameworks that recognise the potential complexity of the

442

relationship between exposure and outcome, and account for known and possible confounding and

443

mediating factors (e.g., socioeconomic status and maternal employment). Additionally, studies should

444

also perform more detailed investigations to explore potential differences in the effect of childcare

445

according to the type of provider, duration, intensity and timing of childcare. This would help in

446

clarifying whether specific patterns of exposure to non-parental childcare have a more or less

447

healthful impact on children’s diet or activity behaviours.

448

The majority of studies included in this review assessed outcomes only during childhood (0-12 years),

449

with only two studies assessing outcomes during adulthood (meal eating at age 22 years, and

450

physical activity level at ages 45-51 years) (41, 49). There is a need for more studies examining long

451

term relationships, to assess whether relationships between childcare and diet, physical activity,

452

sedentary behaviour, or sleep emerge and continue into adolescence and adulthood. Existent birth

453

cohorts may be useful in this respect, although they may impose limitations in the detail and methods

454

of assessment of childcare exposure.

455

There is a lack of studies in middle-income countries, as well as consideration of differences in effect

456

by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Studies located in middle-income countries and investigating

457

interactions with ethnicity and socioeconomic status would allow us to assess whether context

458

influences the relationship between childcare and activity behaviours and hence whether targeted

459

interventions may be justified. Indeed, the only included study which explored this aspect found that

460

informal childcare was consistently associated with higher risk of not breastfeeding for at least 4

461

months across two indicators of socioeconomic status; but there were inconsistent, mostly null,

462

associations with formal childcare (48).

463

464

CONCLUSIONS

465

This review provides the first systematic summary of studies examining the longitudinal relationship

466

between non-parental childcare and diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep. Results

467

were dominated by null findings with little consistent evidence that non-parental childcare was with

468

any of the outcomes of interest. However, the available evidence is limited, highly heterogeneous in

469

the definition and measurement of non-parental childcare, diet and activity behaviours, and lacks an

470

in-depth exploration of different aspects of childcare that may influence this relationship, such as the

471

type, duration or intensity. Further work is required to clearly conceptualise proposed pathways linking

472

childcare with diet and activity behaviours, and to determine whether and what aspects of childcare

473

might discourage physical activity, and promote sedentary behaviour, less healthful diet and sleep

474

patterns. This would, in turn, help identify potential targets for interventions, policies, or regulations to

475

help childcare settings provide healthful environments for the children in their care.
