Abstract
Background: Acute febrile illness (AFI) ranges from mild to mortal, yet severity is difficult to assess.
Host biomarkers may identify patients with AFI who require a higher level of care; choosing appropriate
biomarkers for this role among an expanding pool of candidates is challenging. We performed a scoping
review to evaluate the performance of novel host biomarkers to predict AFI severity.

Methods: PubMed was systematically searched for manuscripts published January 1, 2013 to February
10, 2018 for studies reporting the association of host biomarker levels and a measure of disease severity
among patients with a suspected or diagnosed cause of AFI. Identified abstracts and full text
manuscripts were reviewed for eligibility by 2 reviewers. Biomarker performance was evaluated
primarily by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic to distinguish severe
disease. We aggregated data describing biomarker performance by AUC using weighted mean, fixed
effects meta-analyses, and random effects meta-analyses.

Results: Among 2,303 manuscripts identified, 281 manuscripts met criteria for analysis. Data was
extracted for 278 biomarkers evaluated in 45,737 participants. Among 89 biomarkers evaluated by ≥2
studies, there were 6 biomarkers (proadrenomedullin, copeptin, pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, serum
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1, chitinase-3-like protein-1, and the pediatric sepsis
biomarker risk model), that showed a weighted mean AUC >0.75 (range 0.75-0.84) in >500 patients
over >2 studies.

Conclusions: Although several biomarkers show promise in predicting AFI severity across multiple
studies, their test characteristics do not suggest that they may be used alone to determine AFI prognosis.

Introduction
Acute febrile illness (AFI) is among the most common medical problems in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs).[1, 2] Causes of AFI vary by geographical location, season, and year and can range
from minor ailments to mortal illness.[3-9] Provision of disease-specific diagnostic tests to determine
AFI etiology may not always be feasible.[10] Many patients with AFI can be treated in a community
outpatient setting; others require referral to a higher level of care to prevent further complications and
death.[11, 12]
Accurately predicting the prognosis of patients with AFI, even in high-income countries is challenging;
clinical signs and symptoms may be difficult to recognize and do not consistently predict poor disease
outcome.[13-19] In LMICs, limited epidemiologic data on disease incidence, lack of diagnostics,
limited healthcare worker training, and overburdened healthcare systems pose additional
challenges.[20, 21] Determining the severity of AFI to rapidly identify the patients who require a higher
level of care is important particularly in settings where human resources and diagnostic tests are
limited.[22-26]
Host biomarkers have shown promise as prognostic indicators of disease severity in conditions ranging
from cancer to inflammatory bowel disease and tuberculosis.[27-29] Novel biomarkers have also been
able to discriminate bacterial from viral infection in certain cohorts.[10, 30] C-reactive protein (CRP)
has been used as a measure of disease severity, including AFI, for almost 90 years.[31] Other laboratory
tests in common clinical use such as procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cell count, and liver function
tests have been evaluated for their ability to predict the severity of AFI.[32-38]
There is now growing interest in using biomarkers to guide referral and management of patients with
AFI in LMICs.[39, 40] CRP and PCT are already available for routine clinical use, thus the evidence
base describing their ability to predict illness severity is already well described.[41-43] However,
advances in highly multiplex immunoassay platforms, next-generation sequencing, proteomics, and
metabolomics have sharply increased the availability of data describing the host response to AFI and
the ability to predict its severity.[44-47] We performed a scoping review of recently published literature

on the performance of novel host biomarkers to predict the severity of AFI with the aim to inform
development of diagnostics for clinical use.

Methods
Search strategy
Search terms were selected to identify studies which evaluated the performance of a biomarker to
classify patients at risk for severe disease or death in an analyzable population consisting entirely of
patients with a syndrome known to cause AFI. A non-exhaustive list of causes of AFI in LMICs was
determined by review of AFI etiology in primary papers and systematic reviews.[48-50] Tuberculosis
was intentionally excluded from this list as there is already a separate evidence base describing the
performance of biomarkers for tuberculosis diagnosis and prognosis.[51] Causes of AFI explicitly
included in the process to select search terms included sepsis, septic shock, pneumonia, diarrhea,
malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, meningitis, typhoid fever and scrub typhus. Multiple manual searches
were performed to identify 32 manuscripts that met our inclusion criteria and 16 near-misses.
Controlled vocabulary and text words were identified from these manuscripts. A custom-built Python
script was written to maximize the ratio of correctly identified manuscripts to incorrectly identified
manuscripts using the most parsimonious search terms. Briefly, individual phrases were extracted
from the titles, abstracts, and Medical Subject Heading terms for all 48 manuscripts. Each phrase was
ranked for its sensitivity and specificity to identify manuscripts meeting inclusion criteria. Phrases
were chosen that identified all 32 manuscripts warranting inclusion, and then sequentially eliminated
to create the most parsimonious search query while not missing any manuscripts warranting inclusion.
Using the selected terms, a search was conducted on February 10, 2018 in PubMed as shown in Table
1.

Study Selection
Study population
Studies analyzing populations with one or multiple, suspected or diagnosed causes of AFI were
included. If the analyzed study population included patients without a suspected or diagnosed cause of

AFI, the study was excluded (i.e., patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome without
sepsis). Hospital-acquired infections were not considered cases of AFI and their presence in the study
population was cause for study exclusion. Studies in which all participants had malignancy,
neutropenia, or organ transplantation were excluded. Studies that included only participants under 6
months of age were not considered. Interventional trials were excluded. Papers included only English
language papers published from January 1, 2013 to February 10, 2018.
Biomarkers
The studies included in this review tested one or more biomarkers produced by human hosts and used
the tests to assess the severity of AFI. Studies were restricted to those reporting biomarker measurement
in a routinely available body fluid - blood or its components, saliva, and urine. Biomarker measurement
of bodily fluids requiring invasive sampling (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid) were not considered.
Biomarkers already available for routine clinical use were excluded including: complete blood count
(CBC) and its components, CRP, PCT, liver function tests, kidney function tests, lactate, routine
endocrine tests like thyroid function tests and cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and pro-BNP.
Biomarkers reported from large-scale discovery data sets such as generated in transcriptomic or
proteomic studies without subsequent validation were excluded.
Measure of severity
Only studies reporting disease severity in terms of association with mortality, organ dysfunction,
established severe disease classification system, or clinical severity score were included. Studies that
reported kidney injury as the only measure of disease severity were excluded. Studies reporting only
biomarker levels collected after 48 hours of presentation to healthcare were excluded. If the
investigators performed more than one biomarker measurement, only the earliest measurement was
considered. If more than one measure of disease severity was reported, preference was given to
mortality as an outcome for further analysis.

Screening Process
Each abstract was reviewed for inclusion by 2 independent reviewers. When the 2 reviewers did not
reach agreement, a third reviewer was sought. After abstract review, provisionally included abstracts
were subject to full text review again by 2 independent reviewers. Inter-reviewer disagreement on fulltext reviews was handled similarly to abstracts. Abstract and full text review were managed using
Covidence.[52]
Quality Assessment
We adapted the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2)[53] into a
simplified scoring system to report the risk of bias and concern for applicability using the QUADAS-2
domains of patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. One point each was
given if the study design was prospective, participants were enrolled consecutively, and biomarker
cutoff values were defined prospectively. One point each was subtracted if the study employed a case
control design, participants with hospital-acquired infections were not explicitly excluded, or
ambiguous methods or reporting did not explicitly exclude patients without infections.
Data Extraction
Information was extracted from individual studies into a custom Microsoft Access database. Key
information extracted from each study included the level of care at the time of patient enrollment
which was categorized nonexclusively as outpatient, emergency department, inpatient ward, and
intensive care unit (ICU). The age groups of participants were categorized as including children under
age 5 years, children between age 5 to 18 years, and adults. Non-exclusive diagnoses of the study
population were recorded. Disease severity or patient outcome was recorded either categorically or in
correlation with existing severity scores. Categorical patient outcome measures included death, septic
shock, severe sepsis, respiratory failure, subsequent requirement for ICU admission, and severe
disease according to disease-specific standards. The p-value results of significance testing of an
association of a biomarker with an unfavorable patient outcome or severe disease was extracted. The
strength of the association as reported by area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator

characteristic (ROC), logistic regression odds ratio, and Cox proportional hazard ratio. Unadjusted
measures of association were recorded preferentially over adjusted measures if both were reported as
adjustment was performed infrequently and heterogeneously. Correlation with severity scores
including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II),[54] Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA), CURB-65, Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS),
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was recorded by
Spearman r values, p values, and by severity score above or below a defined biomarker cutoff where
reported.
Biomarker Categorization
Each reported protein biomarker was queried for its inclusion in the Uniprot database.[55] Biomarkers
found to be reported by multiple names were assigned one name for further analysis. Additionally,
biomarkers and their prologues or breakdown products (e.g. adrenomedullin and pro-adrenomedullin)
were reported together. The function of each biomarker reported by more than one study was
determined by query of Uniprot and Cytoscape as well as additional literature review.[56] A flowchart
was created placing the biomarkers in their primary immunological pathway. These immunological
pathways were grouped into eight immune functions to simplify analysis and interpretation.
Biomarkers that had been analyzed in more than one study were grouped parsimoniously according to
their immune function, where applicable: vasoactivity, proinflammatory cytokines, pathogenassociated molecular pattern (PAMP), and danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) recognition,
macrophage differentiation, leukocyte migration, innate effector mechanism, and immune regulation.
Data Analysis
For each biomarker, summary statistics describing the available evidence base to predict the severity
of AFI were compiled including number of studies, combined number of participants, diagnoses, and
level of care of participants. A weighted median and mean AUC was assigned for each biomarker by
calculating the median and mean AUC across studies weighted by the number of participants in each
study. The most promising biomarkers were shortlisted by the following criteria: inclusion of > 500
participants in ≥ 2 studies with a weighted mean AUC of > 0.70 where ≥ 75% of studies showed an

association with the outcome of interest. The most promising biomarkers were further shortlisted by
restricting to biomarkers with a weighted mean >0.75. Additional sub-analyses were performed by
restricting to studies performed only in LMICs that did not include participants admitted to the ICU at
the time of enrollment.

Results
Search results
The initial search yielded 2,303 results (Figure 1). Abstract review identified 444 publications that
provisionally fit inclusion criteria. Review of full text manuscripts eliminated 163 publications due to
reasons identified in Figure 1, leaving 281 manuscripts for data review.
Study and patient characteristics
The included manuscripts reported results for 45,737 participants in 49 countries (Figure 2). The median
number of participants per study was 104 (interquartile range [IQR] 53-186). Participants were
classified as having 21 distinct diagnoses or clinical syndromes (Figure 3); sepsis was the most
common. Among the included manuscripts, 146 (52%) studies were conducted in 24 LMICs and
included 19,513 (43%) participants. Further restricting to studies conducted in LMICs in non-ICU
settings, there were 11,630 participants included in 20 countries.
Diversity of evaluated biomarkers.
Data for 278 unique biomarkers were extracted. Individual publications reported a median of 1 (IQR
1-3) biomarkers. The most frequently evaluated host biomarkers were IL-6 (n = 50), IL-10 (n = 33),
and TNF-α (n = 26). Most biomarkers (n = 189) were only evaluated in a single publication. There
were 89 biomarkers evaluated in at least 2 studies (Supplementary Table); 52 biomarkers were
evaluated in ≥ 3 studies. The most commonly studied biomarker categories were pro-inflammatory
cytokines (19 biomarkers) followed by biomarkers involved in innate effector mechanisms (13
biomarkers), immune regulation (12 biomarkers), leukocyte migration (12 biomarkers) and
vasoactivity (12 biomarkers) (Supplementary Figure 1).

Biomarker performance
Mortality was the reported outcome in 193 (65%) studies. Disease-specific measures of severity were
the second most commonly reported outcome (n = 53, 18%). A measure of strength of association was
reported by 168 (60%) studies. The most commonly reported measure of strength of association was
AUC-ROC, which was reported in 151 (54%) of studies (Table 2). Among the biomarkers studied, there
were 15 biomarkers that showed a weighted mean AUC > 0.7 studied in > 500 patients over ≥ 2 studies
in which ≥ 75% of studies showed an association of the biomarker with the severity outcome; 6 of
which showed a weighted mean AUC > 0.75 (Figure 4). Among studies conducted in LMICs without
ICU patients, there were 4 biomarkers which showed a weighted mean AUC > 0.7 studied in > 500
patients over ≥ 2 studies (Supplementary Figure 2).

Discussion
In this scoping review, we report data for 278 novel biomarkers studied in 45,737 patients with 21
causes of acute febrile illness in 281 studies from 50 countries, yielding an understanding of the current
evidence base for biomarkers to predict the severity of AFI. Among the biomarkers studied, there were
6 biomarkers that showed a weighted mean AUC greater than 0.75 in more than 500 patients over more
than 2 studies. The current evidence base reports mostly the performance of biomarkers predominantly
in high-income intensive care settings; a smaller, yet still robust evidence base describes the
performance of biomarkers outside of ICUs in LMICs. The overall performance of biomarkers suggests
that although they may aid in determining the prognosis of AFI; they are insufficient as the sole
predictors of severity of febrile illness.
Biomarkers in 8 categories demonstrated potentially useful performance in multiple studies exceeding
600 total study patients, suggesting their promise for future study. The number of studies exploring a
biomarker, the number of participants in each study, as well as the variation in ages, disease states, and
settings in which the patient population has been studied, contributes to the breadth of evidence
supporting biomarker performance. As AUC is a single number that accounts for both sensitivity and
specificity independent of a cutoff value, we chose to use AUC as the measure to aggregate biomarker
performance across studies. We found several biomarkers including proadrenomedullin and copeptin

that had sufficiently large evidence bases and favorable performance to suggest that they may warrant
further exploration as fever triage candidates. Proadrenomedullin has been studied in >4,800 patients
in 18 studies across varied geographical settings, age groups, and disease states. Almost all of the studies
of proadrenomedullin reported an AUC, with a weighted mean AUC of 0.78. Similarly, copeptin has
been studied in >3,000 patients with a weighted mean AUC of 0.81.
Current research reporting the performance of biomarkers to predict AFI severity has not been
primarily conducted in the settings where their potential impact is greatest. The highest burden of AFI
is in tropical LMICs1 where inpatient and critical care beds are limited. The most likely intended use
for a fever triage test would be among patients under assessment for the appropriate level care where
the capacity for clinical assessment is limited. Most of the studies in this review were conducted in
ICU settings where patients already likely show frank clinical signs of the requirement for a higher
level of care. Almost half of the included studies were conducted in the US and Europe which may
not represent the population and healthcare systems that would most benefit from an AFI severity
biomarker.
Readily available clinical signs such as respiratory rate and simple scoring systems such as qSOFA
are already used routinely to asess AFI clinical severity. The evidence compiled in this scoping
review does not suggest that single biomarkers, even the most promising ones, perform sufficiently
well enough to clearly supercede existing clinical severity assessment tools such as qSOFA, which
has an AUC of 0.66-0.85 to predict severe or mortal AFI.[57, 58] However, unlike subjective clinical
assessment, biomarkers may be standardized and not rely on the skill of a clinical assessor. Earlier
experience with combining qSOFA and biomarkers have shown promising results, with a higher AUC
for the combination than any individual method of prognosis assessment.[59-61]
There are a several limitations to this scoping review. The available data are highly heterogeneous in
patient population, disease state, and study design. The majority of observations in this scoping
review only reported the presence or absence of an association with an unfavorable outcome; only
48% of observations reported the strength of the association. Only studies published in the last 5 years
were analyzed which may miss earlier and important contributions. The quality assessment that we

performed was basic. Because we required only that patients be suspected or diagnosed to have a
syndrome that is known to cause AFI, a significant proportion of participants may not have been
febrile at the time of study enrollment which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the
intended use case of evaluating febrile patients.
Biomarkers which demonstrated promising performance but have a limited evidence base such as
serum Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-1 may show further promise as triage
candidates when studied in more patients. A formal meta-analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
vasoactive biomarkers, or a prospective study in larger and more varied cohorts would provide higher
confidence evidence than obtained in this scoping review. Additionally, it would allow the
formulation and testing of algorithms with overall improved performance characteristics. Finally,
prospective evaluation of biomarkers in clinical practice will be necessary to show that determination
of AFI prognosis impacts meaningful treatment outcomes.
AFI impacts a significant portion of the global population every year. This scoping review
synthesized a large amount of data to shortlist biomarkers that may be useful in the assessment of AFI
severity as triage test candidates. Further research is necessary to determine whether biomarkers can
be integrated with existing fever assessment guidelines to improve clinical practice and patient
outcome.
