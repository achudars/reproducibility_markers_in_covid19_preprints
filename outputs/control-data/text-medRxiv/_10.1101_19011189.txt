Abstract
Tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are key aspects of Alzheimer’s disease.
Understanding whether these features predict cognitive decline, alone or in combination, is crucial to
develop new prognostic measures and enhanced stratification for clinical trials. Here, we studied how
baseline assessments of in vivo tau pathology (measured by [18F]AV-1451 PET), neuroinflammation
(indexed via [11C]PK11195 PET) and brain atrophy (derived from structural MRI) predicted
longitudinal cognitive changes in patients with Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Twenty-six patients
(n=12 with clinically probable Alzheimer’s dementia and n=14 with amyloid positive Mild Cognitive
Impairment) and 29 healthy controls underwent baseline assessment with [18F]AV-1451 PET,
[11C]PK11195 PET, and structural MRI. Cognition was examined annually over the subsequent 3
years using the revised Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination. Regional grey-matter volumes,
[18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 binding were derived from fifteen temporo-parietal regions
characteristically affected by Alzheimer’s disease pathology. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
was used on each imaging modality separately, to identify the main spatial distributions of pathology.

slope of cognitive decline on the neuroimaging components and examined univariable models with
single-modality predictors, and a multi-modality model of prediction, to identify the independent and
combined prognostic value of the different neuroimaging markers.
PCA identified a single component for the grey-matter atrophy, while two components were found
for each PET ligand: one weighted to the anterior temporal lobe, and another weighted to posterior
temporo-parietal regions. Across the whole-sample, the single-modality models indicated significant
correlations between the slope of cognitive decline and the first component of each imaging modality.
In patients, both stepwise backward elimination and Bayesian model selection revealed an optimal
predictive model that included both components of [18F]AV-1451 and the first (i.e., anterior temporal)
component for [11C]PK11195. However, the MRI-derived atrophy component and demographic
variables were excluded from the optimal predictive model of cognitive decline. We conclude that
temporo-parietal tau pathology and anterior temporal neuroinflammation predict cognitive decline in
patients with symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease pathology. This indicates the added value of PET
biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, over and above MRI measures of
brain atrophy and demographic data. Our findings also support the strategy for targeting tau and
neuroinflammation in disease-modifying therapy against Alzheimer’s Disease.

Introduction
The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease are tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and
amyloid-β plaques, but neuroinflammation has also emerged as a key process in Alzheimer’s disease
and other neurodegenerative disorders (Pasqualetti et al., 2015; Ransohoff, 2016; Schain and Kreisl,
2017). However, the differential role of these pathologies in predicting clinical progression of
Alzheimer’s disease remains to be ascertained. This represents a critical step to develop new
prognostic markers and test the effect of novel disease modifying therapies that target different
pathologies in Alzheimer’s disease.
The aggregation of misfolded tau protein plays a fundamental role in synaptic dysfunction and
neuronal loss, and correlates with clinical severity in the Alzheimer’s disease clinical spectrum
(Nelson et al., 2012; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014). A significant presence of amyloid-β plaques is
also indicative of likely cognitive decline in mid- and later-life, although the association of both
neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment has been found stronger with the distribution and burden
of NFTs than it is for neuritic plaques (Nelson et al., 2012; Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014). Microglia
activation and neuroinflammation represent a third key determinant in the etio-pathogenesis of
Alzheimer’s disease and in its progression (Heneka et al., 2015; Mhatre et al., 2015; Calsolaro and
Edison, 2016), independently or synergistically with tau and amyloid pathology.

Each of these processes can now be quantified and localised indirectly in vivo using brain
imaging, such as PET imaging with radioligands targeting tau pathology, amyloid burden, and
microglial activation (see Chandra et al., 2019 for a review). The PET ligand [18F]AV-1451 is
sensitive to cortical tau accumulation in Alzheimer’s disease, and has high affinity for the
characteristic paired helical tau filaments (Xia et al., 2013; Marquié et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2016).
[18F]AV-1451 PET studies have shown marked tau accumulation in the entorhinal cortex in patients
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which extends to temporo-parietal regions in Alzheimer’s
disease (Hall et al., 2017). [18F]AV-1451 bindings also correlates with Braak staging of
neurofibrillary tau (Schwarz et al., 2016; Schöll et al., 2018), and post-mortem patterns of
Alzheimer’s disease pathology (Sander et al., 2016). This is also in keeping with evidence that tau
deposition is evident as a continuum from normal aging through MCI to Alzheimer’s dementia
(Schöll et al., 2018), and correlates with cognitive impairment (Brier et al., 2016, Cho et al., 2016b;
Johnson et al., 2016; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Pontecorvo et al., 2017). In addition, PET imaging
supported the previous evidence on a stronger association of cognitive deficits with tau burden than
with amyloid-β (Brier et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016).
The PET ligand [11C]PK11195 is a well-established marker for microglial activation in
Alzheimer’s disease via its binding to the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial
membrane protein which is overexpressed in activated microglia (Scarf and Kassiou, 2011). In
Alzheimer’s disease, [11C]PK11195 shows high binding in temporo-parietal regions and cingulate
cortex (Stefaniak and O’Brien, 2015). Higher levels of neuroinflammation in these regions is also
negatively associated with cognitive performance in MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia (Edison et al.,
2008; Okello et al., 2009, Fan et al., 2015a; Passamonti et al., 2018, 2019) although they do not
correlate well with amyloid burden (Yokokura et al., 2011), suggesting an independent role of
microglia activation in mediating cognitive deficit.
There are extensive data on atrophy in Alzheimer’s Disease, measured in terms of volume loss in
vivo by MRI, at MCI and dementia stages of progressive Alzheimer’s Disease pathology. MRI
measures, for example of medial temporal lobe volumes, correlates with disease severity, and are
predictive of future conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s Disease (Frisoni et al., 2010; Leung et al.,
2013; Jack et al., 2015). However, cell loss and atrophy are a relatively late feature in a cascade of
pathology, and it is not clear how MRI compares with measures of molecular pathology as a
prognostic marker, especially in view of marked age-related structural changes (Raz et al., 2005;
Walhovd et al., 2011).
In this study, we use baseline in vivo measures of tau pathology, microglia activation, and brain
atrophy to predict the rate of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer’s disease pathology,

ranging from MCI with biomarker evidence of amyloid pathology to clinically probable Alzheimer’s
disease. Our hypothesis was that the PET biomarkers of tau pathology and neuroinflammation are
strong predictors of cognitive impairment and decline, and that whereas MRI may be predictive in
isolation, the prognostic information of MRI is better captured by direct measures of molecular
pathology using PET (Bejanin et al., 2017; Mattsson et al., 2019). This hypothesis builds on the
evidence that tau burden relates to age-related cognitive decline (Schöll et al., 2016; Aschenbrenner
et al., 2018; Maass et al., 2018), and progression of dementia over 6 to 18 months in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (Koychev et al., 2017; Pontecorvo et al., 2019). In contrast to past studies that
have assessed the relationship between longitudinal PET markers and clinical changes in Alzheimer’s
Disease (Fan et al., 2015b, 2017; Chiotis et al., 2018; Jack et al., 2018; Southekal et al., 2018; Cho
et al., 2019), we study how a multi-modal and cross-sectional assessment of distinct pathologies is
able to predict longitudinal decline in Alzheimer’s Disease, examining the individual or combined
prognostic contribution of tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and brain atrophy in predicting
cognitive decline.
A better characterisation of the factors predicting decline in Alzheimer’s disease will help to
develop enhanced prognostic and outcome measures for clinical trials targeting more than one
pathology. Although previous findings support the use of MRI and PET imaging in the diagnosis and
monitoring of disease progression, the prognostic value of these in vivo measures and their combined
effect in predicting clinical decline in Alzheimer’s disease remains undetermined. Previous studies
which have evaluated the predictive values of neuroimaging markers in Alzheimer’s disease have
typically assessed different neuroimaging modalities in isolation rather than exploiting the
mechanistic and prognostic values that is offered by multi-modal neuroimaging. We therefore
assessed the independent and combined predictive effects of baseline neuroimaging biomarkers for
tau pathology ([18F]AV-1451 PET), neuroinflammation ([11C]PK11195 PET) and brain atrophy
(structural MRI) on longitudinal cognitive changes over a period of three years in the clinical
spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease.
Focussing therefore on temporo-parietal regions, we predicted: 1) a significant association
between baseline measures of each neuroimaging technique and longitudinal decline in cognition,
assessed separately for each modality; 2) partially independent and additive effects of MRI and PET
measures on cognitive decline, assessed with all modalities in a single multivariate model. Moreover,
we predicted that the molecular markers of baseline tau and neuroinflammation PET could be more
informative than structural MRI on longitudinal cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s disease.

Material and methods
Participants
We recruited 26 patients: twelve with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s dementia and 14
with amnestic MCI and a positive amyloid PET scan as biomarker of Alzheimer’s Disease (Klunk et
al., 2004). Probable Alzheimer’s dementia was diagnosed according to the National Institute on
Aging-Alzheimer’s Association guidelines (McKhann et al., 2011) and confirmed in all patients
during follow-up. Given the long-term and intensive nature of the longitudinal project, all patients at
baseline had >12/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to be eligible to the study. MCI
patients had MMSE score > 24/30, and memory impairment not ascribable another diagnosis (Albert
et al., 2011). We also included 29 healthy controls with MMSE >26/30, absence of memory
symptoms, no signs of dementia, or any other significant medical illnesses.
All gave informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The NIMROD protocol
(Neuroimaging of Inflammation in Memory and Related Other Disorders, (Bevan-Jones et al., 2017))
was approved by the NIHR National Research Ethic Service Committee and East of England
(Cambridge Central).
During the first visit, demographic information and medical history were collected. All
participants underwent baseline neuropsychological assessment, MRI scan and one, two or three PET
scans depending on the group. The clinical examination and neuropsychological battery were
repeated annually for three follow-up visits (see Bevan-Jones et al., 2017 for more details). The
revised Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) (Mioshi et al., 2006) was used to assess the
cognitive performance at each visit.

Imaging data acquisition and pre-processing
At the baseline, all subjects underwent 3T MRI performed on a Siemens Magnetom Tim Trio or Verio
scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). MCI and AD subjects had both [18F]AV-1451
PET and [11C]PK11195 PET, while, to minimise radiation exposure to healthy people, control
subjects were divided into two groups: 14 underwent [18F]AV-1451 PET, while another 15 underwent
[11C]PK11195 PET. PET scanning was undertaken on a GE Advance PET scanner (GE Healthcare,
Waukesha, USA) and a GE Discovery 690 PET/CT (see (Passamonti et al., 2017, 2018) for more
details). Patients with MCI also underwent 40-70 minutes post-injection [11C]PiB PET to quantify
the density of fibrillar Aβ deposits for classification of Aβ status. [11C]PiB scans were classified as
positive if the average standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) across the cortex using a cerebellar
grey matter reference region was > 1.5. MCI subjects with positive Aβ status were included in this
study.

T1-weighted MRI was used for tissue class segmentation into grey matter, white matter and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using SPM12. Segmented images were used to determine regional grey
matter, white matter and CSF volumes, and to calculate brain volume (grey + white matter) and total
intracranial volume (TIV = grey matter + white matter + CSF) in each participant. Grey and white
matter segments from 33 representative subjects were imported to create an unbiased template (11

controls, 11 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 11 patients with Alzheimer’s Dementia,
matched for age and sex across the groups) using the DARTEL pipeline in SPM12. All other images
were subsequently warped and aligned to the template. The group template was warped to the
MNI152 template using 'Population to ICBM' function. The deformations from this transformation
were combined with the flow fields of each individual and inverted. Eighty-three cortical and
subcortical regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using a version of the Hammers atlas (Gousias et
al., 2008) modified to include brainstem parcellation and the cerebellar dentate nucleus. All
segmented images were modulated and warped to the modified Hammers atlas in MNI space.
Individual regional grey matter volumes were then extracted from the spatially normalised and
modulated grey matter segments, using the ‘spm summarise atlas’ function.
For each subject, the aligned PET image series for each scan was rigidly co-registered to the
T1-weighted MRI image. Prior to kinetic modeling regional PET data were corrected for CSF
contamination by dividing by the mean region grey plus white matter fraction determined from SPM
tissue probability maps smoothed to PET spatial resolution. For [11C]PK11195, supervised cluster
analysis was used to determine the reference tissue time-activity curve and non-displaceable binding
potential (BPND) was calculated in each ROI using a simplified reference tissue model that includes
correction for vascular binding (Yaqub et al., 2012). For [18F]AV-1451, BPND was assessed in each
ROI with the simplified reference tissue model (Gunn et al., 1997) using superior cerebellar cortex
grey matter as the reference region. For more details about data acquisition and pre-processing steps
see Passamonti et al. (Passamonti et al., 2017, 2018).

Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics. Continuous variables (age, education, ACE-R) were compared between groups
with an independent-samples t-test, and categorical variables (sex) with the Chi-square test. The effect
size of each t-test comparison was computed to quantify differences between the two groups (Cohen's
d > 0.8, valuable difference). ACE-R scores at follow-up were annualised to the nearest whole year.

Principal components analysis. The number of ROIs was reduced from 83 to 15, by a)
combining left and right regional values, as in our previous studies on Alzheimer’s disease

(Passamonti et al., 2017, 2018), and b) focussing on a priori regions related to Alzheimer’s disease
pathology (see Supplementary Table 1). Considering the literature showing early neurodegeneration,
tau pathology, and neuroinflammation in temporal and parietal brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease
(i.e., temporo-parietal regions) we focused our analyses on those areas. Regional grey matter volume
used the sum of the grey matter volumes in the corresponding left and right hemisphere ROIs,
corrected for TIV. For both [11C]PK11195 and [18F]AV-1451, a volume-weighted mean of left and
right regional BPND values was calculated. Values determined for the 15 bilateral ROIs from each
imaging dataset were included in three principal component analyses (PCAs), run separately for grey
matter volumes, [11C]PK11195 and [18F]AV-1451 BPND values. This reduces dimensionality and the
problem of multiple comparisons, identifying a limited number of components that best explain the
data variance. We applied an orthogonal Varimax rotation to maximize interpretability and specificity
of the resulting components. We retained components with eigenvalues >1. To test whether correction
for CSF affected the PCA results, we applied the same analyses on [ 18F]AV-1451 PET and
[11C]PK11195 regional data not corrected for CSF partial volume.
The individual component scores were corrected for the time interval in months between the
scan and the baseline cognitive assessment. Mean and standard deviation of the time interval between
the imaging scans and the baseline cognitive assessment were: 1.75 ± 2.50 months for MRI, 7.18 ±
5.68 months for [18F]AV-1451 PET and 6.12 ± 9.07 months for [11C]PK11195 PET. The residuals
extracted for each component were included in a multiple regression on cognitive decline as
independent variables.

Latent Growth Curve Model for cognitive data. An univariable LGCM was fitted on
longitudinal ACE-R scores across all subjects (n=55), to obtain the (i) intercept; (ii) slope, quantifying
the rate of change and its form (i.e. linear or nonlinear); (iii) the relation between intercept and slope.
The estimated parameters are based on the individuals’ trajectory, indicating average change and
individual difference. Covariates can be added to the model to assess their associations with both
intercept and slope. Three time points and 5-10 cases per parameter are required for a standard LGCM
(Bentler and Chou, 1987; Newsom, 2015). LGCM was implemented in Lavaan software (Rosseel,
2012) using full information maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors for
missingness and non-normality. We considered four indices of good model fit (Schermelleh-Engel et
al., 2003): 1) the chi-square test with the p-value (good fit: > 0.05), 2) the root-mean-square error of
approximation (RMSEA, acceptable fit: < 0.08, good fit: < 0.05), 3) the comparative fit index (CFI,
acceptable fit: 0.95–0.97, good fit: > 0.97), and 4) the standardized root mean-square residual (SRMR,
acceptable fit: 0.05–0.10, good fit: < 0.05). From the model fitting, variables “intercept” and “slope”

were created extracting the individual estimated values for each subject in the model. T-tests and
analysis of variance tested for group differences in initial cognitive performance and annual change.

One-step prediction procedure: Latent Growth Curve Model with predictors. First, across
all subjects, we tested the predictive value of each imaging method on cognitive decline, applying
five LGCMs with each scan-specific component’s values (corrected for months from the baseline) as
predictor of cognitive intercept and slope. The models were tested separately for MRI (n=55),
[11C]PK11195 PET (n=41) and [18F]AV-1451 PET (n=40) components. Second, in patients only
(n=26), the individual scores of all imaging components were included as predictors in the LGCM on
longitudinal ACE-R scores, to test the combined predictive effect of all imaging modalities.
The one step procedure would be the ideal approach to answer our research questions,
however, this leads to model estimation challenges in a cohort with a modest sample size. For this
reason, we next applied a two-step prediction procedure: 1) extracting individual slope values from
the initial LGCM for cognitive data across all the population, and 2) including these values as
dependent variable in linear regression models with brain imaging components as predictors. We
present both frequentist and Bayesian analyses to ensure inferential robustness and allowing us to
quantify evidence in favour of the null hypothesis.

Two-step frequentist prediction procedure: linear regression models on LGCM estimated
parameters. First, across all subjects, the residual values of each scan-specific PCA component
(corrected for months from the baseline) were included as single predictors in separated univariable
linear regression models with the individual slope values extracted from the initial LGCM as
dependent variable. The significance level was set at p<0.01 corrected for multiple comparisons with
the Bonferroni correction (p=0.05/5). Next, the individual scores of the imaging methods’
components were included as independent variables in a multivariable regression analysis on patients
alone (N=26), who underwent all three imaging scans. This model was fit to examine the individual,
as well as combined, ability to explain variance in cognitive decline using brain marker components
as well s age, education, and sex as independent variables. The model used stepwise backward
selection (entry criterion p=0.05 and elimination criterion p=0.1). In a supplementary analysis, we
also applied a “reduced” multivariable linear regression analysis with slope as dependent variable and
only the first component of each imaging method as predictors to test that the different number of
components between MRI and PET did not affect the estimation. Given the challenges of stepwise
model selection, and the limitations of sample size to utilize more optimal methods (e.g. regularized

model fitting), we ran the analysis using Bayesian methodology, to ensure inferential robustness of
our findings and confidence in null results.

Two-step Bayesian prediction procedure: linear regression models on LGCM estimated
parameters. Finally, we applied a Bayesian multiple regression analysis with brain components and
demographic variables as predictors, and the estimated slope values as dependent variable. This
approach was used to test whether there was evidence for the absence of independent variables’ effect
for those components excluded from the final models (as opposed to frequentist type II error). In the
model comparisons, we considered as final model the one with the highest Bayes Factor compared to
the null model (BF10). Then, we used a reduced Bayesian linear regression, mirroring the reduced
model applied with the frequentist approach, which included only the first component of each imaging
method as predictors of slope.

and two-step prediction procedures.

Results
Descriptive statistics. Significant differences between patient and control groups were found for
education (t(53)=2.4, p=0.02, Cohen's d=0.64) and ACE-R scores (t(53)=8.6, p<0.001, Cohen's
d=2.37), however, the effect size of the education difference was negligible (d < 0.08). There were
not significant group differences in age (t(53)=-1.7, p=0.09, Cohen's d=-0.47) and sex (χ2(1)=0.17,
p=0.68) (Table 1). Individual ACE-R scores at baseline and at each follow-up are shown in Fig. 1.

Principal component analysis of Grey Matter Volumes, [18F]AV-1451 BPND and
[11C]PK11195 BPND. For grey-matter volumes, the PCA on the pre-selected 15 AD-specific cortical
regions identified only one component that encompassed all the temporo-parietal regions and
explained 74% of the variance (Fig. 2, left panel). Two principal components were detected for
[18F]AV-1451 BPND data, explaining 91% of the total variance (83% first component; 8% second
component). The first component was loaded onto the posterior temporal and parietal regions, while
the second component was weighted to the anterior temporal lobe, amygdala, insula and hippocampus

(Fig. 2, middle panel). For [11C]PK11195 BPND data, two principal components were identified, and
these explained together the 76% of data variance (56% for the first component; 20% for the second
component). The first component involved anterior and medial temporal lobe, while the second
component was mainly loaded onto the posterior temporo-parietal regions and insula (Fig. 2, right
panel). Using PET data without CSF correction yielded qualitatively similar results.

Subject-specific rate of cognitive decline. The LGCM of longitudinal ACE-R scores fitted
the data adequately (χ2(8)=10.93, p=0.206; RMSEA=0.09 [0.00 – 0.21], CFI=0.99, SRMR=0.04).
The mean of the intercept was 86.40 (Standard Error (SE)=1.44, z-value=60.02, fully standardized
estimate (Std Est) =8.28, p<0.001) and average cognition declined over time (slope, estimate (est)=3.01, SE=0.80, z-value=-3.75, Std Est=-0.54, p<0.001). The intercept significantly co-varied with the
slope (est=38.51, SE=9.24, z-value=4.17, Std Est (correlation)=0.67, p<0.001, such that individuals
with higher (better) baseline performance showed less steep decline. As expected, patients
significantly differed from controls in their intercept (t(53)=9.39, p<0.001) and slope (t(53)=6.42,
p<0.001) indicating a faster and more severe cognitive decline (Fig. 3). Across three groups, ANOVA
confirmed group differences in the intercept (F(2)=63.44, p<0.001; mean (SD) for: HC=94.18 (3.27);
MCI+=81.25 (6.17); AD=73.60 (8.96)) and slope (F(2)=53.74, p<0.001; mean (SD) for: HC=0.40
(0.82); MCI+=-3.56 (3.08); AD=-10.62 (5.71)), with post-hoc confirmation of differences between
each pair of groups (all p<0.005).

One-step prediction Latent Growth Curve Model with predictors. The LGCM including MRI
fitted the data marginally well (χ2(10)=18.33, p-value=0.05, RMSEA=0.13 [0.01-0.23], CFI=0.98,
SRMR=0.03). Individual differences in the summary brain measure were strongly and positively
associated with both slope (path Std Est=0.58, p<0.001) and intercept (path Std Est=0.67, p<0.001).
This suggested that individuals with greater grey matter volumes showed better baseline performance,
and slower longitudinal decline, than those with smaller volumes.
The LGCM of the posterior [18F]AV-1451 component fitted the data adequately
(χ2(10)=16.30, p-value=0.09, RMSEA=0.12 [0.00-0.22], CFI=0.98, SRMR=0.03). Here too, both the
slope (path Std Est=-0.62, p=0.001) and intercept (path Std Est=-0.53, p<0.001) were strongly
governed by individual differences in the first component. In contrast, in the model with only the
anterior [18F]AV-1451 component (χ2(10)=21.75, p-value=0.01, RMSEA=0.17 [0.07-0.27],
CFI=0.96, SRMR=0.05), there was no association between the scores on the neural component and
either the intercept (path Std Est=-0.12, p=0.431) or the slope (path Std Est=-0.39, p=0.057).

Finally, the LGCM with the anterior [11C]PK11195 component fitted the data adequately
(χ2(10)=16.32, p-value=0.09, RMSEA=0.13 [0.00-0.23], CFI=0.97, SRMR=0.02). Individual
differences in the [11C]PK11195 component governed both slope (Std Est=-0.51, p=0.002) and
intercept (Std Est=-0.43, p<0.001) correlated with the component #1. In the model with the posterior
[11C]PK11195 component as regressor (χ2(10)=9.33, p-value=0.50, RMSEA=0.00 [0.00-0.17],
CFI=1.00, SRMR=0.03), the slope resulted significantly correlated with the component (Std Est=0.45, p=0.009), but not the intercept (Std Est=-0.010, p=0.951).
In patients, an LGCM including the components of all three imaging methods did not fit well
(χ2(18)=34.76, p-value=0.01, RMSEA=0.17 [0.08 – 0.26], CFI=0.92, SRMR=0.04). With this
caveat, cognitive decline (slope) was predicted by baseline posterior [18F]AV-1451 (path Std Est=0.49, p=0.025) and anterior [11C]PK11195 (path Std Est=-0.40, p=0.017) components’ scores, but not
the posterior [11C]PK11195, the MRI (path Std Est=0.10, p=0.52) or the anterior [18F]AV-1451 (Std
Est=-0.22, p=0.23) components.

Two-step prediction: linear regression. Across all subjects, the rate of cognitive decline
(slope from LGCM) was significantly associated with: 1) the MRI weighting (Std Beta=0.61,
p<0.001); 2) the posterior [18F]AV-1451 (Std Beta=-0.60, p<0.001); 3) and anterior [11C]PK11195
(R=-0.47, p=0.002). All these results survived Bonferroni’s correction. Correlations of slope with the
anterior [18F]AV-1451 (Std Beta=-0.36, p=0.022), and the posterior [11C]PK11195 (Std Beta=-0.39,
p=0.012) did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (p<0.01). See Fig. 4 for a graphical
representation of the significant associations between individual scores (x axis) of imaging-specific
principal components and slope in ACE-R scores (y axis) extracted by LGCM. Model summary and
coefficients for all univariable models with slope as dependent variable are reported in Table 2.
In patients, the final model of multiple regression on cognitive slope (adjusted R2 = 0.418, Std
Error= 4.18; p=0.001) included both [18F]AV-1451 components (#1: Est=-2.57, Std Error=0.71,
p=0.002; #2: Est=-1.64, Std Error=0.74, p=0.038), and the anterior [11C]PK11195 (#1: Est=-1.92, Std
Error=0.74, p=0.017) as predictors (Fig. 5 and Table 3). Of note age, education, sex, the MRI
component, and the posterior [11C]PK11195 component were excluded from the final model.
Model summary and coefficients for both the initial model (adjusted R2 = 0.389, Std Error= 4.43;
p=0.027), the full model with only brain predictors (adjusted R2 = 0.474, Std Error= 4.12; p=0.002),
and the final model are reported in Supplementary Table 2. Either in the initial model with covariates
or in the full model with only brain measures as predictors, the posterior [18F]AV-1451 component
and the anterior [11C]PK11195 component showed the highest estimated coefficients (Supplementary
Table 2). In addition, the reduced multiple regression analysis, with the first component of each

imaging method only, included the [18F]AV-1451 component (Est=-2.42, Std Error=0.77, p=0.004)
and the [11C]PK11195 component (Est=-1.71, Std Error=0.80, p=0.042) in the final model (adjusted
R2 = 0.366, Std Error=4.52; p=0.002), while the MRI component was discarded.

Two-step Bayesian prediction. With all brain components and demographic variables as
candidate predictors of cognitive decline, model comparison using Bayes factors indicated that the
best model included both [18F]AV-1451 components (#1: Mean (SD) = -2.15 (0.65); BF inclusion =
24.70; #2: Mean (SD) = -1.37 (0.68); BF inclusion = 4.20), and the anterior [11C]PK11195 component
(Mean (SD) = -1.61 (0.68); BF inclusion=6.44) as predictors (BF10 = 46.56; R2 = 0.52). Hence, the
best model in this statistical framework did not contain structural MRI data. See Table 3 for details
on the final model and Supplementary Table 3 for a list of models evaluated and the corresponding
BF10. The reduced Bayesian regression analysis with only the first component of each imaging
method as predictor was in accord with the frequentist approach. The best model identified with BF10
criteria was the one with only the posterior [18F]AV-1451 and the anterior [11C]PK11195 components
only as predictors of slope (BF10 = 20.81; R2 = 0.42), not the MRI component.

Discussion
This study demonstrates the independent and combined prognostic value of neuroimaging biomarkers
for tau pathology ([18F]AV-1451 PET), neuroinflammation ([11C]PK11195 PET) and brain atrophy
(structural MRI), in predicting longitudinal cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Baseline markers for tau pathology, neuroinflammation and atrophy in temporo-parietal regions
individually predicted cognitive decline. Faster cognitive decline was associated with higher baseline
tau pathology in posterior temporo-parietal regions and increased neuroinflammation in the anterior
temporal structures. The Bayesian analysis confirmed the evidence against the predictive value of
MRI atrophy over and above the PET markers of tau pathology and neuroinflammation.
PCA was used to derive the most parsimonious neuroanatomical patterns of pathology that
explain most of the imaging variance across the cohort. PCA indicated separate sets of regions (i.e.,
components) in which tau pathology and neuroinflammation clustered in anterior vs. posterior
temporo-parietal regions, and this pattern is consistent with the well-established distribution of
pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (Garibotto et al., 2017; Jagust, 2018; Whitwell, 2018). This
distinction would be lost in a global average measure, while the use of separate regional values would
have led to redundant multiple comparisons. In keeping with previous studies (see Chandra et al.,
2019 and Melis et al., 2019 for reviews), our analyses showed that the participants’ weighting on
atrophy, posterior [18F]AV-1451 and anterior [11C]PK11195 components were separately associated

with more rapid cognitive decline (Fig. 4, Table 2). This result was confirmed by both the one- and
two-step univariable prediction approaches. This corroborates the previously reported associations
between cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s disease and the individual effects of tau pathology,
neuroinflammation, and downstream cortical atrophy (Femminella et al., 2016; Bejanin et al., 2017).
Although cross-sectional imaging studies with different PET ligands have reported single
associations of cognitive performance with in vivo tau (Brier et al., 2016, Cho et al., 2016b; Johnson
et al., 2016; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Pontecorvo et al., 2017, see Chandra et al., 2019 for a review)
and microglial activation (Edison et al., 2008; Okello et al., 2009, Fan et al., 2015a; Passamonti et
al., 2018, 2019; see Chandra et al., 2019 for a review), less is known about their relationship to
longitudinal cognitive changes. Previous PET studies in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia and MCI
showed that baseline [18F]AV-1451 PET uptake correlates with cognitive decline over a period of six
(Koychev et al., 2017) or 18 months (Pontecorvo et al., 2019). Conversely, microglial activation (as
measured by [11C]PK11195 PET) shows progression over 14-16 months (Fan et al., 2015b, 2017),
although the predictive value of baseline measures of inflammation on longitudinal cognitive decline
has not been investigated yet. Other studies using [11C]-PBR28 to quantify neuroinflammation over
a period of at least one year (median 2.7 years) in MCI and Alzheimer’s Disease reported increased
microglial activation as a function of a significant worsening on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale
(Kreisl et al., 2016). Likewise, binding of [18F]DPA-714, another TSPO PET ligand, is negatively
associated with cognitive performance (Hamelin et al., 2018).
Improving our knowledge of how baseline measures of tau, neuroinflammation, and brain
atrophy predict cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease may inform future cost-effectiveness studies
in large and epidemiologically representative cohorts of patients. Although other studies have
assessed the predictive value of different brain markers on longitudinal cognitive decline in
Alzheimer’s disease (see Chandra et al., 2019 and Melis et al., 2019 for reviews), this study is the
first one, to our knowledge, to evaluate and compare three biomarkers simultaneously (i.e., tau
pathology, neuroinflammation, brain atrophy). Overall, our data are consistent with past research and
highlight the added value of PET imaging over and above MRI markers. Although brain atrophy do
show in isolation predictive value for cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (Jack et al., 2015),
when the models included tau burden, microglial activation and atrophy jointly, only PET was found
to be predictive, but not MRI (Fig. 5, Table 3). This critical result was confirmed by both frequentist
and Bayesian analyses which showed evidence against the added value of MRI data on predicting
cognitive decline over and above PET assessments. This aligns with cross-sectional studies that report
a stronger association of tau molecular imaging than structural MRI with cognitive performance in
patients with Alzheimer’s disease (Bejanin et al., 2017; Mattsson et al., 2019). More specifically, in

patients with MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia, Benjanin and colleagues reported an association
between regional tau PET binding and cognitive impairment, which was partly mediated by grey
matter volumes (Bejanin et al., 2017). Cognition was equally explained by brain atrophy and tau
pathology, but after accounting for grey-matter values, in vivo tau pathology remained correlated with
cognitive performance (Bejanin et al., 2017). Likewise, Mattson et al. (2019) found that both
[18F]AV-1451 PET and structural brain MRI are associated with cognition in Alzheimer’s disease
(spanning preclinical, prodromal, and dementia stages), although associations of tau PET indices were
stronger than those for MRI markers (Mattsson et al., 2019).
Our data suggest that posterior temporo-parietal [18F]AV-1451 binding and anterior temporal
[11C]PK11195 binding were associated with cognitive decline. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease,
temporo-parietal cortical tau PET signal is consistent with Braak stage III and above, while in
cognitively healthy older people, the signal is localised to entorhinal cortex and inferior temporal
cortex (Cho et al., 2016a; Johnson et al., 2016; see Jagust, 2018 for a review). Post mortem studies
have likewise reported tau deposition in the medial temporal cortex in healthy elderly people and
Alzheimer’s dementia (Jagust, 2018). Tau burden in the entorhinal, limbic, and temporal neocortex
relates to cortical atrophy in patients with MCI and Alzheimer’s disease, although not in cognitively
normal controls (Timmers et al., 2019). These findings suggest that tauopathy in the medial part of
the temporal lobe may be an age-related norm, rather than indicative of Alzheimer’s disease cognitive
decline (Femminella et al., 2018). For this reason, tau PET binding here may be a weaker predictor
for cognitive decline than tau in the posterior temporo-parietal regions. The co-occurrence with
amyloid-β and neuroinflammation may induce the tau spreading from the medial temporal lobe to
other cortical regions, which may be associated with downstream neurodegenerative processes and
cognitive decline (Mhatre et al., 2015; Jagust, 2018; Perea et al., 2018). This suggests a driving role
of neuroinflammation in tau spread and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (Yoshiyama et al.,
2007; Asai et al., 2015; Maphis et al., 2015), in which activated microglia facilitate tau spread
(Maphis et al., 2015; Perea et al. 2018).
There are limitations to our study. [11C]PK11195 PET is not only tracer for microglial
activation. Several second-generation PET radioligands for TSPO have been developed since
[11C]PK11195 (e.g., [11C]PBR28 and [18F]DPA-714), and used in human studies (Vivash and OBrien,
2016). They are characterised by higher signal-noise ratio and lower lipophilicity than [11C]PK11195.
However, they require genetic analysis to assess a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs6971), which
influences their binding affinity and causes heterogeneity in PET data (Dupont et al., 2017). In
contrast, [11C]PK11195 is not significantly affected by this polymorphism and hence can be used
across the whole patient population, making it our preferred method to study microglia activation.

Second, the cross-sectional nature of our imaging assessment did not enable mediation analysis of
the causality between tau pathology, microglial activation progression and their effect on cognitive
decline. However, we speculate that both processes are directly involved in mediating the rate of
cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s disease, carrying some unique information across the disease
spectrum. Third, the modest sample size of our cohort limited the applicability of the one-step
prediction procedure with multiple predictors, which may lead to a more precise prediction than the
two-step procedures. However, both frequentist and Bayesian multivariable approaches give similar
results, aligning with those obtained by the one-step prediction. The convergence between all
statistical models (i.e., LGCM with predictors, linear regression and Bayesian model) mitigates
against sample-dependant biases on the estimation of the most parsimonious model.
We conclude that the PET markers of regional pathological processes are stronger predictors
than atrophy as measured by MRI. The models were convergent in identifying tau burden in posterior
cortical regions and neuroinflammation in the anterior temporal lobe as key imaging predictors of
cognitive decline in the clinical spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast, atrophy measures
predicted cognitive decline only if considered individually but not over and above the effects of tau
burden and inflammation when we consider all processes together. Our findings support the use of
PET imaging of tau pathology and microglial activation for prognostication and patients’
stratification in clinical trials.

Figure 2. Regional weights of the structural MRI component (left), and rotated regional weights of
[18F]AV-1451 components (middle) and the [11C]PK11195 components (right). Components were
identified applying three independent principal component analyses on 15 temporo-parietal regions.
For structural MRI, regional grey matter (GM) volumes were included in the analysis, while for each
PET tracer, the binding potential values in those regions were considered, separately for each
modality.

denote intercepts (means). Thick single-headed arrows indicate regressions while thick doubleheaded arrows indicate variance and covariance (grey for intercept and black for slope). Values in
Roman are standardized parameter estimates, and values in italics are unstandardized parameter
estimates (with standard errors in parentheses). The annual rate of change was positively associated
with performance at baseline (lower initial cognitive scores were associated with a higher annual
rate of cognitive changes).
