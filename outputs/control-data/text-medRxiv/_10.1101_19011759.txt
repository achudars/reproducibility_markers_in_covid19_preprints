Abstract
Introduction: Gastric cancer remains an important health problem. It’s

46

molecular mechanisms and interactions with the immune system are still not well

47

elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the concentration and profile of

48

serum proteins and immunoglobulins in Mexican patients with advanced gastric

49

cancer. Materials and methods: We performed a descriptive study. Adult

50

patients from both sexes were included. The problem group was formed of

51

patients with advanced gastric cancer and the control group was formed of

52

healthy subjects. Demographic data, gastric cancer histological type and stage of

53

tumor node metastasis (TNM) system were recorded. The profile and

54

concentration of serum proteins and immunoglobulins was determined and

55

analyzed in different subgroups classified by sex, histologic type and stage of

56

TNM system. To compare the concentrations of serum proteins and

57

immunoglobulins the ANOVA test was performed. A p <0.05 was considered

58

statistically significant. Results: We included 88 patients with advanced gastric

59

cancer and 74 healthy controls. There were no differences in demographic data

60

among the groups, and the most common gastric cancer type was the diffuse

61

(67.04%). Women with gastric cancer from any type presented higher levels of

62

immunoglobulin G (IgG) compared with the control group (p <0.001) and men

63

with gastric cancer of intestinal type in TNM stage III presented higher levels of

64

IgG compared with it’s counterpart of diffuse type (p <0.001). Also, patients with

65

intestinal type gastric cancer presented higher concentrations of alpha-1

66

globulins compared with patients with the diffuse type (p <0.05). Finally, patients

with diffuse gastric cancer TNM stage IV presented the lowest albumin/globulin

ratios. Conclusion: There is a greater concentration of serum IgG in some

69

subgroups of patients with advanced gastric cancer, the concentration of alpha-1

70

globulins is different between the intestinal and diffuse types and the

71

albumin/globulin ratio is lower in the diffuse type.

Introduction

89

Gastric cancer (GC) remains an important health problem. It is one of the

90

most common causes of cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related

91

death worldwide [1]. The Lauren classification sub-classifies GC into diffuse,

92

intestinal and mixed type, each one with different pathological characteristics and

93

prognosis [2-5]. Despite the great advances that have been made in the

94

diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer, its prognosis remains poor as it is a

95

disease with nonspecific clinical manifestations in early stages, and then, it is

96

usually diagnosed in advanced stages when it is no longer possible to offer

97

curative therapies [6]. Hence, it remains relevant to study the molecular

98

mechanisms regulating the development of gastric cancer and to identify new

99

molecular targets for early detection and targeted treatments.

100

Several experimental studies have been performed with this approach, the

101

vast majority directed to the detection of over-expression or anomalies in surface

102

molecules and molecules from cellular secretion. Many of the studies have not

103

shown satisfactory results, however, many others have favored the development

104

of new treatments [7]. The changes in the expression of the cell surface

105

molecules of malignant cells leads to a loss in the immunological tolerance,

106

which triggers immunological responses against them. Although these

107

anomalous changed molecules can be identified both in the interior and in the

108

surface of the malignant cells, the antigens on the surface of the tumor are the

109

mains responsible of the tumor immunogenicity [8-9].

110

Some studies have been carried out on the evaluation of the interaction

111

between gastric cancer and the immune response. The local humoral

112

immunological response has been studied, and it has been observed that in the

113

cytoplasm of the advanced gastric cancer tumor cells there is less

114

immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) distribution than in the cells

115

of early gastric cancer and intestinal metaplasia. Similarly, it has been observed

116

that in the stroma of advanced gastric cancer there is less infiltration of positive

117

plasma cells for immunoglobulin G, (IgG), IgM and IgA, than in the stroma of

118

early gastric cancer [10]. However, tissue levels of IgA in the unaffected stomach

119

of patients with gastric cancer are elevated compared to healthy controls [11].

120

Regarding the systemic humoral immunological response, it has been observed

121

that patients with gastric cancer have lower levels of globulins and IgG in

122

comparison with healthy patients [12]. Moreover, different correlations have been

123

established between gastric cancer and the humoral immune response. For

124

example, it has been observed that depending on the stage of the disease and

125

the immunoglobulin allotypes, the levels of antibodies against the membrane

126

glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1), which is overexpressed in gastric cancer tumor

127

cells, may be elevated [13]. Also, high levels of antibodies against the Thomsen-

128

Friedenreich glycotope related to MUC1 have been observed in some cases and

129

associated with a less aggressive course of the disease [14].

130

To date, there is no study that has evaluated the levels of globulins and

131

immunoglobulins in patients with advanced gastric cancer in relation to the

132

Lauren’s classification, which would help in further understanding the humoral

immune response in this disease. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the

concentration and profile of serum proteins and immunoglobulins in Mexican

135

patients with intestinal and diffuse advanced gastric cancer.

Materials and methods

138

Study type and population

139

We performed an observational, transversal, comparative and analytical

140

study. Patients of both sexes from 20 to 85 years were included. The problem

141

group was formed of patients from the High Specialty Medical Unit “Manuel Ávila

142

Camacho”, Puebla, Mexico, with the diagnosis of gastric cancer in stages III and

143

IV, according to the tumor node metastasis (TNM) system. The control group

144

was formed of healthy volunteers. We excluded patients with

145

immunosuppressive states as diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, primary

146

or secondary immunodeficiencies and patients on chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

147

The recruitment period was from August 1st, 2016 to July 31st, 2018.

148

Ethics approval and informed consent

149

This study was approved by the research and ethics committee of the

150

School of Medicine of the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla, Puebla,

151

Mexico, whit number 526 and written informed consent was obtained from all

152

participants.

Quantification of total proteins

154

Total proteins

155

The concentration of total proteins was determined by spectrophotometry

156

by the Biuret technique following the instructions of Krueziger [15,16]. The biuret

157

method is based on the formation of a colored copper protein complex which is

158

measured by spectroscopy absorbance at 540 nm. A standard concentration

159

curve was made using bovine serum albumin (BSA) before each determination to

160

compare the absorbances of the samples. The absorbance of the color produced

161

was read at 540 nm. The total protein concentration was recorded in g/dL.

162

Determination and quantification of protein fractions

163

Serum protein electrophoresis in cellulose acetate

164

The protein fractions were determined by electrophoresis in cellulose

165

acetate according to the standard method of the Analysis of Serum Protein, with

166

Veronal buffer, pH 8.6, at an ionic strength of 0.05 [17]. Staining was done with

167

Ponceau red. The concentration of each fraction (albumin, alpha-1 globulin,

168

alpha-2 globulin, beta globulin and gamma globulin) was determined in a Bio-

169

Rad Gel DocTM XR+ Gel Documentation System and reported in g/dL.

170

Determination and quantification of immunoglobulins

171

Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA)

172

The concentrations of serum immunoglobulins were determined by the

173

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The ELISA kits of eBioscience™

174

for Human IgM, IgG and IgA total (ELISA Ready-SET-Go!™ Kit) were used

175

following the provider’s instructions. The concentration of the IgM, IgG and IgA

176

values were recorded in mg/dL.

177

Statistical analysis

178

We determined a sample size of 88 patients to achieve an alpha error of

179

0.05 and a power of 90%. We recorded general variables of age, sex, gastric

180

cancer type of Lauren’s classification and stage of TNM classification.

181

Demographic data are presented as numbers with percentages for categorical

182

variables and mean with standard deviation for numerical variables. For the

183

comparison between the groups, the X2 test and Student’s-t test were used as

184

appropriate. The values of the determinations of total protein, albumin, alpha-1

185

globulin, alpha-2 globulin, beta globulin, gamma globulin, IgM, IgG and IgA were

186

recorded. For the comparison between groups of the values of proteins, its

187

fractions and immunoglobulins, the ANOVA test for three groups was performed.

188

A p <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The SPSS software

189

V.20.0.0.0 was used.

Results
We included 88 patients with gastric cancer and 74 healthy controls. Among

192
193

the patients with gastric cancer, 24 (27.27%) were intestinal type, 59 (67.04%)

194

were diffuse type and 5 (5.68%) were not classified. There were no differences

195

between age and sex among the different gastric cancer types; however, there

196

were more patients with stage IV disease in the intestinal type group (Table 1).

Discussion

290

In the demographic analysis, no relevant differences were observed

291

between the groups of patients with intestinal and diffuse types of gastric cancer.

292

The majority of patients with advanced gastric cancer were of the diffuse

293

histological type (71%), which was expected as it is well described that gastric

294

cancer of diffuse type has a more aggressive biological behavior, although lately,

295

this aggressiveness has been attributed to a subgroup of diffuse gastric cancer

20

296

that presents with “linitis plastica”, a particularly aggressive infiltrative pattern

297

[18].

298

After comparing the concentrations of proteins and immunoglobulins

299

between the groups of patients with advanced gastric cancer from different TNM

300

stages (TNM stages III and IV), no differences were observed, and therefore,

301

according to the concentration of serum proteins and immunoglobulins, both

302

stages could be grouped into a single group of “advanced gastric cancer”.

303

One of the most interesting findings from this study was the difference observed

304

in IgG concentrations between healthy subjects and patients with advanced

305

gastric cancer of certain subgroups. Compared with the control group, the

306

subgroup of women with advanced gastric cancer (TNM stages III and IV) of any

307

type (intestinal and diffuse), and the subgroup of men with advanced gastric

308

cancer (TNM stage III) of the intestinal type, presented higher concentrations of

309

serum IgG. These results suggest that in certain subgroups of patients with

310

advanced gastric cancer there is an increase in the humoral immune response

311

related to IgG. When comparing these results with previous studies that have

312

evaluated other aspects of the humoral immune response in patients with gastric

313

cancer, there are concordances and contradictions. On the one hand, in one

314

study that evaluated the local humoral immune response, it was observed that in

315

patients with advanced gastric cancer there was an increase in IgG and a

316

depletion of IgM and IgA [10]. On the other hand, our results contradict the

317

previously reported one in which it was observed that patients with gastric cancer

318

had lower serum IgG levels than the control patients, however, this study

21

319

included patients with gastric cancer of all stages, and in our study, we included

320

Mexican patients with advanced gastric cancer (TNM stages III and IV), which

321

may explain the difference, since in advanced gastric cancer there is a greater

322

tumor burden and inflammation, which may explain an increased immunological

323

response to antigens from the tumor cells or as consequence of the increased

324

inflammatory response produced by the tumor, finally resulting in higher IgG

325

serum levels in the patients with advanced gastric cancer [12]. Kurtenkov, et. al.

326

have found elevated IgG anti-MUC1 autoantibodies in patients with gastric

327

cancer and also found that these autoantibodies were associated with cancer

328

progression [14]. We determined total IgG, which includes IgG antibodies and

329

normal IgG, and found high values in patients with advanced gastric cancer,

330

which could correlate with cancer progression too. This greater concentration of

331

serum IgG, could also be an antibody against an antigen associated with the

332

tumor that may favor the spread and metastasis, or may be an antibody

333

produced by the tumor cells to promote its development.

334

Another interesting finding of this study was that when we compared the

335

profile of serum proteins between patients with gastric cancer of different

336

histologic types, an increase in the concentration of the alpha-1 globulin fraction

337

was observed in the serum of patients with gastric cancer of the intestinal type.

338

Therefore, further studies are required to evaluate the profile of the alpha-1

339

fraction of serum proteins in patients with gastric cancer of the intestinal type,

340

with techniques that allow separation of all the fractions of proteins contained in

341

the alpha-1 fraction such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ant then,

342

determine if these are already known proteins that are elevated as acute phase

343

reactants or if these are abnormal proteins secreted by the tumor cells. However,

344

we found in 36.7% of women with diffuse gastric cancer stage IV and in 5.9% of

345

women with diffuse gastric cancer stage III, low concentrations of alpha 1

346

globulin (α1 anti-trypsin), which may be due to a hereditary genetic predisposition

347

in this type of cancer, and perhaps, because of the high percentage of patients in

348

which alpha 1 globulin is found, diminished or absent, the Mexican population

349

could carry a haplotype that makes them susceptible to this malignant disease. In

350

breast cancer, α1 anti-trypsin, is a biomarker for early stages [19], in our patients

351

it is decreased in advanced stages, so we could consider it as a biomarker of

352

malignancy.

353

Further, we calculated the albumin/globulin ratio, this relationship is not

354

only related to the nutritional status but to the inflammatory response [20]. The

355

serum albumin is very important for the stabilization of DNA and inhibition of

356

carcinogenesis. It is well established that elevated albumin levels are associated

357

with a favorable prognosis of survival in several types of cancer [21]. Xue et al,

358

related the pre-surgery values of the albumin/globulin ratio to the prognosis of

359

gastric cancer, they found that a value <1.36 was associated with poor prognosis

360

[22]. These values have further been related to sex, age and size of the tumor

361

[23]. In our study, patients with diffuse gastric cancer stage IV predominated

362

(74%), and in this patients we found that 66% had an albumin/globulin ratio of

363

<1.2, hence, this relationship could be considered as a prognostic indicator of

364

poor outcome from malignancy in Mexican population too.

365

Finally, in diffuse gastric cancer, the mutation of the gene of e-cadherin

366

CH1, is considered and hereditary risk factor, and in our study population, we

367

found a high prevalence of patients with diffuse gastric cancer in TNM stage IV,

368

with low values of alpha 1 globulin (alpha-1 antitrypsin) and low albumin/globulin

369

ratio, witch may be also related with a genetic predisposition. In some of these

370

patients, we have made the determination of E-cadherin, and we have found it

371

absent. For this reason, it’s possible that the Mexican population may have an

372

allele, which makes them susceptible to diffuse gastric cancer type and an

373

aggressive course of this disease, witch may be in relation to a polymorphism of

374

the CDH1 gene specific to the Mexican population, as a genetic risk factor for

375

diffuse gastric cancer type [24].

376

377

Conclusion

378

In certain subgroups of patients with advanced gastric cancer there are

379

higher serum concentrations of serum IgG, the concentration of serum alpha-1

380

globulins is different between the intestinal and diffuse types of gastric cancer

381

and the albumin/globulin ratio is lower in the diffuse type of gastric caner. Further

382

studies are needed to determine the meaning of these differences.
