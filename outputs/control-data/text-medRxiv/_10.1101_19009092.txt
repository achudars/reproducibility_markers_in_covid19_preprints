Structured Abstract

: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is commonly used to assess cognitive decline in
Alzheimer's disease patients.
INTRODUCTION

: We divided 741 participants with blood microarray data in the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) into three groups based on their most recent CDR assessment: cognitive
normal (CDR=0), mild dementia (CDR=0.5), and probable AD (CDR≥1.0). We then used machine learning
to predict cognitive status using only blood RNA levels.
METHODS

: One chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) probe was significant. By combining nonsignificant
probes with p-values less than 0.1, we averaged 87.87 (s = 1.02)% predictive accuracy in classifying the
three groups, compared to a 55.46% baseline for this study.
RESULTS

: We identified one significant probe in CLIC1. However, CLIC1 levels alone were not
sufficient to determine dementia status. We propose that combining individually suggestive, but
nonsignificant, blood RNA levels can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy.

Background

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) permeates the elderly population, affecting over 10% of adults older
than 651. The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association now classifies AD as a continuum
of biomarker and neuroimaging levels under a biological construct2, indicating that biology and cognitive
decline are intertwined. Although many techniques are available to diagnose cognitive decline,
undetected dementia remains at 55-68% globally3. Patients are often unaware of their cognitive
decline4, limiting their ability to adequately address physical and mental limitations caused by dementia.
Furthermore, 15-35% of patients older than 65 who are offered cognitive screening refuse to perform
cognitive assessments, especially if they do not personally know anyone affected with AD5,6. Even after
being referred by a community pharmacist to a physician for a follow-up cognitive study, almost 80% of
pre-screened patients did not see a physician within 60 days, and over 40% of patients were unwilling to
pay for additional cognitive screening7. Older adults often view cognitive assessments as embarrassing,
invasive, and confusing8,9. Without a proper diagnosis, patients may postpone end-of-life planning until
their memory further deteriorates, or they may be incapable of completing an advance directive (i.e.,
living will) if their memory has already deteriorated10. Therefore, it is imperative that cognitive function
is accurately and affordably diagnosed early in disease progression in a manner that makes the patient
feel comfortable.
The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)11 is a widely used cognitive diagnostic assessment12 that is
comparable to the gold standard dementia diagnostic criteria13. The CDR examination requires 8-9 hours
of training before it can be administered by a researcher or clinician (see
https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/cdr/cdr.htm). The patient examination takes between 30-90 minutes14 and
requires assessing differences in patient memory compared with the memory from a reliable informant
(e.g., family member or caregiver)15. In contrast, a blood draw is less intrusive and could be completed in
a matter of minutes by healthcare professionals without specific cognitive training. Therefore, a blood
draw establishing a biological basis for cognitive decline would improve diagnostic accessibility and
potentially increase patient response rate.
We used blood RNA levels in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to predict
patient CDR. We performed dimensionality reduction to avoid overfitting on the training dataset by
using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) as an initial filter to extract the most significant microarray
probes, similar to other machine learning analyses of microarray data16. We filtered 49,386 RNA probes
based on their ANOVA p-values, and we used various p-value thresholds to assess predictive accuracy.
Probes exceeding the p-value threshold were used as input features in a support vector machine to
predict CDR scores for 741 participants in the ADNI dataset.
Methods

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private
partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to
test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other
biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the
progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

We used expression data from an Affymetrix HG U219 Array that cost less than $150 per array in 2015.
ADNI preprocessed the raw expression values using the Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) normalization
method before mapping and annotating the probe sets to the hg19 human reference genome. The ADNI
Genetics Core performed several other quality control measures on the dataset. Array plate
randomization, gender and diagnosis balance, participant and probe quality control, and SNP-transcript
cis-eQTL posterior probabilities were completed to ensure that analyses conducted on the dataset are
not impacted by confounding factors. We also ensured that each individual had taken a CDR exam,
which limited the available dataset to 49,386 probes across 741 participants whose cognitive abilities
ranged from normal to severe dementia.

We conducted a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) on each of the 49,386 probes individually
to test if expression levels significantly differ
between the three groups. After a Bonferroni
correction, our significance threshold was 1.012 x
10-6. We further assessed sex-specific biases in the
three groups using the five X-inactive specific
transcript (XIST) probes in the dataset, and we
determined that no significant sex differences exist
between the three cognitive groups (p-values=
0.0145, 0.017, 0.019, 0.041, and 0.068). We ordered
all probes based on their ANOVA p-values from
most significant to least significant and we
identified significant probes. We then pruned our
dataset based on the following alpha values: 1 x 106
, 5 x 10-6, 1 x 10-5, 5 x 10-5, 1 x 10-4, 5 x 10-4, 0.001,
0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0. These cutoff criteria
were used to assess the predictive potential of
combining RNA probes as input in a machine
learning model. We used the Waikato Environment

sequential minimal optimization, which is a fast
heuristic of a support vector machine. Support

We labelled participants in one of three cognitive groups based on their most recent CDR score:
cognitive normal (CDR=0), mild cognitive impairment (CDR=0.5), and probable AD (CDR≥1.0). We
clustered CDR levels of 2.0 and 3.0 into the probable AD group to maintain predictive power because
only 15 individuals had a CDR score of 2.0 and only
one individual had a CDR score of 3.0. In total, 250
individuals were cognitive normal, 411 individuals
had mild cognitive impairment, and 80 individuals
had probable AD based on their CDR scores.

125

two ways: 1. Normalizing input features by rescaling the data between 0 and 1, and 2. Standardizing

input features based on standard deviations from the sample mean. All other hyperparameters were leftt

128

input values, repeating each analysis 10 times by randomizing our data for each replicate to minimize

), although the difference in the mean predictive accuracy

186

was minimal (0.52%). All ten permutations in both datasets had a 0% false positive rate for AD. Incorrect

187

predictions for AD patients were 2.91 to 3.25 times more likely to be classified as mild cognitive

188

impairment than as cognitive normal in the normalized and standardized datasets, respectfully.

189

Similarly, incorrect predictions for cognitive normal individuals were 4.51 to 4.81 times more likely to be

190

classified as mild cognitive impairment than as AD in the normalized and standardized datasets,

191

respectfully. Using additional probes with higher p-values in the model significantly decreased the

192

predictive accuracy. Including all probes in the support vector machine lowered the predictive accuracy

193

to the baseline, 55.46%.

194
195

Discussion

196

We identified one significant probe in the chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1). CLIC1 has previously

197

been linked to AD and induces neurotoxin production in the presence of β-amyloid (Aβ) protein . A

198

direct link between CLIC1 expression and Aβ-induced microglial activation has also been established .

199

Our analyses show that significantly higher levels of CLIC1 exist in AD patients compared with cognitive

200

normal and mild cognitive impairment groups. These results support previous indications that CLICL1

201

levels increase in AD patients. They also show that these differences are detectable in peripheral blood.

202

However, CLIC1 expression alone is insufficient to accurately diagnose cognitive status in an individual.

18

19

203
204

Our analyses indicate that RNA levels from a blood microarray can accurately indicate cognitive decline

205

in an individual. Although most RNA levels do not significantly differ between cognitive groups,

206

combining the small differences in RNA levels in individually nonsignificant probes significantly increases

207

the predictive accuracy of the model. We show that we can accurately predict CDR using a support

208

vector machine on blood RNA levels. The support vector machine was able to increase the predictive

209

accuracy from a 55% baseline to almost 90%. There was also a clear directionality in the predictions,

210

with incorrect predictions for cognitive normal and AD patients more likely to be one cognitive group

211

away instead of two cognitive groups away from the diagnosis. This directionality in predictions

212

indicates that blood RNA levels gradually change as a patient progresses from a cognitive normal state

213

to AD.

Our analyses also suggest that combining nonsignificant traits that suggest an association (e.g., p-value
less than 0.1) may increase the accuracy of disease assessments. At the population level, low body mass
index20, vital exhaustion21, changes in retinal microvasculature22, and many other risk factors each
indicate early signs of Alzheimer's disease. However, the natural variance within the population
prevents each of these methods from being used as a diagnostic technique. Similarly, individual RNA
probes within the ADNI dataset have levels that significantly overlap between cognitive groups and
cannot be used in isolation to diagnose a patient. However, predictions became highly accurate when
considering thousands of minor differences in RNA levels after eliminating excess noise in the dataset.
Therefore, using a similar technique to combine other input features (e.g., body mass index,
psychological health, retinal vessel density, etc.) in machine learning models may further increase the
accuracy of early AD diagnoses.
