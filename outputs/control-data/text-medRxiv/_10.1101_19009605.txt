Abstract

17

Background: Our aim is to produce guidance on exploring and mitigating possible bias when genetic

18

instrumental variables (IVs) associate with traits other than the exposure of interest in Mendelian

19

randomization (MR) studies.

20

Methods: We use causal diagrams to illustrate scenarios that could result in IVs being related to

21

(non-exposure) traits. We recommend that MR studies explore possible IV-non-exposure

22

associations across a much wider range of traits than is usually the case. Where associations are

23

found, confounding by population stratification should be assessed through adjusting for relevant

24

population structure variables. To distinguish vertical from horizontal pleiotropy we suggest using

25

bidirectional MR between the exposure and non-exposure traits and MR of the effect of the non-

26

exposure traits on the outcome of interest. If vertical pleiotropy is plausible, standard MR methods

27

should be unbiased. If horizontal pleiotropy is plausible, we recommend using multivariable MR to

28

control for observed pleiotropic traits and conducting sensitivity analyses which do not require prior

29

knowledge of specific invalid IVs or pleiotropic paths.

30

Results: We applied our recommendations to an illustrative example of the effect of maternal

31

insomnia on offspring birthweight in the UK Biobank. We found little evidence that unexpected IV-

32

non-exposure associations were driven by population stratification. Three out of six observed non-

33

exposure traits plausibly reflected horizontal pleiotropy. Multivariable MR and sensitivity analyses

34

suggested an inverse association of insomnia with birthweight, but effects were imprecisely

35

estimated in some of these analyses.

36

Conclusions: We provide guidance for MR studies where genetic IVs associate with non-exposure

37

traits.

Introduction

55

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a special case of instrumental variable (IV) analysis where single

56

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) randomly allocated at conception are used as the IVs.(1, 2) MR

57

requires three key assumptions: first, IVs are strongly associated with an exposure of interest

58

(relevance); second, there are no common causes between IVs and an outcome of interest

59

(independence); and third, IVs influence the outcome only through the exposure (exclusion

60

restriction).(1, 2) While the relevance assumption can be tested, the independence and exclusion

61

restriction assumptions are difficult to verify and only their plausibility can be explored.(3) One

62

common approach to date is to test for associations between genetic IVs and a range of non-

63

exposure traits in either one- or two-sample setting as a way to assess the specificity of the genetic

64

IV.(4-7)

65

With increasing sizes of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and more extensive coverage of

66

the genome due to imputation with more comprehensive panels, SNPs are increasingly found to

67

associate with multiple traits.(8, 9) Therefore, we aim to develop guidance for assessing potential

68

violations of independence and exclusion restriction assumptions when genetic IVs are associated

69

with other (non-exposure) traits. This paper is laid out as follows. In section 1, we use directed

70

acyclic graphs (DAGs) to illustrate four scenarios that could result in an association of a genetic IV

71

with a non-exposure trait and highlight which scenarios would bias MR estimates. In section 2, we

72

describe different methods for discriminating between scenarios and methods for mitigating against

73

potential bias for both one- and two-sample settings. In section 3, we apply this framework to an MR

74

analysis exploring the potential causal relationship between maternal insomnia and offspring

75

birthweight in the UK Biobank (UKB). In section 4, we end with a discussion of our

76

recommendations.

77

Scenarios that could explain associations of genetic IVs with multiple traits

78

There are four broad scenarios consistent with genetic IVs (Z) being associated with multiple traits

79

(Table 1). Population stratification (PS; DAGs 1.1-1.3 in Table 1), might occurs due to the study

80

including subgroups of people with different ancestry or who were born or live in different

81

geographical locations. If the distribution of SNPs and of non-exposure traits (W) differs by these

82

subgroups, then this PS is a common cause of Z and W and generates an association between

83

them.(10) As an example of this, evidence shows that place of birth in UKB has been associated with

84

genetic IVs for education, height and body mass index (BMI), and also with health outcomes.(11) If PS

85

affects the distribution of Z and the outcome (Y) directly or via W, PS could confound MR estimates

86

(DAGs 1.1-1.2). This would represent a violation of the independence assumption. If PS confounds

87

the Z-exposure (X) association, Z could still be used to estimate the unbiased effect of X on Y if PS did

88

not affect Y independently of X (DAG 1.3).

89

Pleiotropy refers to the association of a SNP with multiple phenotypes, and has two types: vertical

90

(also known as spurious or false) and horizontal (also known as genuine or true).(12) In the scenario of

91

vertical pleiotropy (DAGs 2.1-2.3 in Table 1), Z is a cause of X, which in turn affects Y. Despite

92

pleiotropic associations of Z with X and W, the effect of Z on Y is fully mediated by X. Therefore, the

93

exclusion restriction assumption is not violated.(13) In the scenario of horizontal pleiotropy (DAGs

94

3.1-3.3 in Table 1), Z is a cause of X and W, and both of them affect Y independently. This violates

95

the exclusion restriction assumption leading to potential bias in MR estimates.(13)

96

In the scenario of reverse causality (DAG 4.1 in Table 1), Z is really a primary cause of Y, which in

97

turn affects X. As such, inclusion of Z into IVs for X would give a biased X-Y association due to a

98

violation of the exclusion restriction assumption.(14) With respect to the focus of this paper, this

99

would only result in an association of Z with W if Z directly or indirectly influences W (DAG 4.1). We

100

have included this scenario for completeness. However, exploration of Z-W associations is not a

101

good way of identifying causal directions between X and Y. Bidirectional MR and Steiger

104

Recommendations for exploring above scenarios and to obtain unbiased MR estimates

105

Having described the different scenarios that could result in genetic IVs relating to non-exposure

106

traits below we provide a list of recommendations for first identifying such non-exposure traits and

107

then exploring which are likely to bias the main MR results and how that might be mitigated

108

(summarised in Table 1).

109

1. Searching more thoroughly for genetic IV-non-exposure trait associations

110

To date most MR studies have explored associations of genetic IVs with potential confounders of

111

exposure-outcome associations. By definition exposure-outcome confounders are unlikely to

112

influence genetic variants (which are fixed at conception) and the association of genetic IVs with

113

several non-exposure traits are likely to reflect violation of the exclusion restriction via pleiotropy

114

(i.e. the direction of the arrow will go from genetic variants to the confounders rather than the other

115

way). Consequently, selection of non-exposure trait associations should aim to explore violation of

116

the independence and exclusion restriction assumptions and their specific mechanisms by exploring

117

associations with any risk factors for the outcome, rather than focus solely potential exposure-

118

outcome cofounders.

119

Once this is acknowledged there are two broad approaches that could be used to identify non-

120

exposure traits that genetic IVs might influence in either one- or two-sample MR. One is to use

121

prior/existing knowledge of the key causes of the outcome and then examine whether the genetic

122

exposure-IV relates to any of these non-exposure causes of the outcome. The second is to undertake

123

a hypothesis free comprehensive genotype-to-phenotype (also known as Phenome-wide) approach,

124

in which we use automated systems to explore all possible associations of our genetic IVs.(15, 16)

125

There are differing pros and cons of these two approaches including different challenges relating to

126

balance between valid application of the following recommendations 3-5 versus a greater reliance

127

on sensitivity analyses in recommendation 6. We explore this further in the discussion.

128

2. Assessing the impact of population stratification

129

In one-sample MR with individual participant data, we recommend exploring associations of Z with

130

as many indicators of PS as possible. These could include place (country, region, town,

131

longitude/latitude) of birth and residence, study centre, and genetic principal components of

132

ancestral background. Adjusting the Z-W associations for these sources of PS and exploring whether

133

this alters the association is also useful for exploring PS. If the association was attenuated after

134

adjustment, it would suggest that the Z-W association may be driven by PS. In two-sample MR using

135

summary statistics, the data have typically been generated a priori and thus the investigators are

136

limited in what they can do to account for PS. However, they can still check whether the original

137

GWAS has used robust genomic control methods to properly account for PS. Newly developed two-

138

sample MR methods (MR-PRESSO,(17) GSMR,(18) LCV(19) and GIV(20)) may not be able to overcome PS

139

either if PS is not controlled in the original GWAS, as acknowledged by Koellinger et al.(10)

140

3. Assessing bias due to horizontal pleiotropy by using MR to explore the W-Y association

141

After excluding the possibility of bias by population stratification, it is important to investigate

142

whether unexpected Z-W associations might be explained by horizontal pleiotropy. We recommend

143

first undertaking MR to explore whether there is evidence for the effect of W on Y. This requires

144

valid genetic IVs for W, which may not always be available, and sufficient statistical power to

145

precisely estimate the W-Y association. It is also important to consider the strength of the genetic

146

IVs for W, as weak instrument bias would tend to bias the estimate towards the observational

147

association in one-sample MR but to the null in two-sample MR with non-overlapping samples and

148

increase the standard errors of the estimate.(21) If there are valid and strong genetic IVs for W and

149

these provide (convincing) evidence that W does not affect Y, then there cannot be violation of the

150

exclusion restriction criteria via W. If there is evidence for an effect of W on Y, or it is not possible to

151

determine this, then bidirectional MR of the effect of X-W versus W-X is valuable (next point).

153

4. Distinguishing vertical from horizontal pleiotropy by testing causal directions between X and
W

154

If there is no causal effect between X and W, horizontal pleiotropy (DAG 3.1) would be more

155

plausible than vertical pleiotropy (DAGs 2.1-2.3). If bidirectional MR suggests that X causes W,

156

vertical pleiotropy (DAGs 2.1-2.2) may be more plausible than horizontal pleiotropy (DAGs 3.1-3.2),

157

although we could not fully rule out the possibility that W mediates the effect from Z to Y partly

158

independently of X (DAG 3.3). However, if bidirectional MR suggests that W causes X, W could be a

159

confounder of X and Y and horizontal pleiotropy (DAG 3.2) may be more plausible than vertical

160

pleiotropy (DAGs 2.1-2.2), although we could not fully rule out the possibility that W cannot affect Y

161

independently of X (DAG 2.3).

162

Bidirectional MR can be conducted in either one- or two-sample setting,(22, 23) but could be

163

misleading when there is marked difference in statistical power between X-W versus W-X

164

associations. For example, if the power for W-X association is low (relative to the power for X-W

165

association) it may appear that there is no causal effect of W on X even in the presence of such an

166

effect. Additionally, overlapping SNPs in the GWAS of X and W can make it unclear which SNPs to

167

select as valid IVs for X and W in bidirectional MR.(24) In two-sample setting, Steiger directionality test

168

can help to identify (independent) valid IVs for X or W by comparing the variance explained by each

169

SNP in X to that in W, as it assumes that a valid IV should explain more variance in trait A than in trait

170

B if trait B is a downstream effect of the trait A.(25) However, Steiger directionality test could be

171

misleading if measurement errors in X and W are substantially different.(25) For example, insomnia is

172

measured much less accurately than height or BMI in UKB (see real data example in the next

173

section).

174

5. Adjusting for potential horizontal pleiotropic effects via known non-exposure traits

175

Where there is evidence (from 3 and 4 above) that there may be bias due to horizontal pleiotropy

176

(DAGs 3.1-3.2) from specific non-exposure traits (W), multivariable Mendelian randomization

177

(MVMR) can be used to obtain unbiased estimates in one- and two-sample settings.(26) MVMR

178

requires not only IVX (IV for X)-X and IVW-W associations but also IVX-W and IVW-X associations, which

179

means two-sample MR studies using summary statistics have to access to full results of the original

180

GWAS. If W mediates both Z-Y and X-Y associations (DAG 3.3), controlling for W in MVMR obtains

181

the direct effect rather than the total effect of X on Y, while its total effect should be estimated by

182

using a subset of SNPs only related to X.(26) MVMR can also be used to estimate direct effects of

183

correlated traits on an outcome as long as the genetic IVs independently predict each trait.

184

Limitations of MVMR have been discussed by Sanderson et al., e.g. the strengths of IVs may

185

decrease dramatically after attempting to including many non-exposure traits in the estimation.(26)

186

6. Exploring and controlling for bias due to horizontal pleiotropy via unknown traits

187

It is possible that MVMR adjusting for horizontal pleiotropy via known/measured traits is still biased

188

by unknown/unmeasured traits. Therefore, sensitivity analyses that explore bias due to unbalanced

189

‘unmeasured’ horizontal pleiotropy will still be required. In one- and two-sample MR, we

190

recommend initial exploration of this by assessing between SNP heterogeneity.(27) This should be

191

done even if SNPs are being combined into a single polygenic risk score (PRS). In one-sample MR

192

heterogeneity is commonly explored by ‘overidentifying’ tests,(28) while in two-sample MR using

193

summary data the Cochran’s Q statistic is an equivalent test.(27) If the exposure causes the outcome

194

and IVs are valid, we expect the effect of the IV on the outcome to be proportional to its effect on

195

the exposure across genetic IVs. Therefore, heterogeneous causal estimates across genetic IVs are

196

indicative of invalid IVs. Most of the sensitivity analyses that have been developed for addressing

197

horizontal pleiotropy aim at exploring the presence or being robust to heterogeneous (potentially

198

invalid) IVs. Table 2 summarises the commonly used methods (i.e. sisVIVE(29) for one-sample MR and

199

MR-Egger,(30) weighted median,(31) weighted mode,(32) MR-PRESSO,(17) MR-TRYX(33) for two-sample

200

MR), including their additional assumptions. It is important to recognise that (i) heterogeneity tests

203

Real data example

204

We use the effect of maternal insomnia on offspring birthweight as a motivating example, as it has

205

been suggested that having insomnia and other forms of sleep disturbance may be associated with

206

lower offspring birthweight though results are inconsistent.(24, 34, 35) We explore this question in UK

207

Biobank women,(36) using a PRS that combines 80 genome-wide significant SNPs (listed in

208

Supplementary Data 1) from the largest GWAS of insomnia in women.(37) We tested associations of

209

the PRS with six observed traits (maternal height, BMI, age at first live birth, education, frequency of

210

alcohol intake and ever smoking) that are known to (or could plausibly) influence offspring

211

birthweight, and found that the PRS was associated with all of them (Figure 1). We demonstrate how

212

to use the above recommendations in both one- and two-sample MR analyses, with full details in

213

Supplementary Methods.

214

UKB is a cohort of 503,325 men and women who were on the National Health Service registry, aged

215

between 40-69 years and living within 25 miles from one of 22 assessment centres.(36) One-sample

216

MR included genetically unrelated women of European descent who reported frequency of

217

insomnia, had experienced at least one live birth and reported the birthweight of their first live born

218

child (N=165,184). Supplementary Table 1 summarises how each variable used here were measured

219

in UKB and coded in our example. We also randomly split those genetically unrelated women of

220

European descent into two groups (Supplementary Figure 1) to obtain SNP specific summary

221

statistics for two-sample MR in this illustrative example. We selected the SNPs for these analyses

222

from the published GWAS of insomnia(37), height,(38) BMI,(39) age at first live birth(40) and education(41)

223

in women and from the previous GWAS of frequency of alcohol intake and ever smoking in UKB men

224

and women.(42) We obtained both SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome results from both of the random

225

sub-samples and the pooled results from analyses in which sample 1 was used for SNP-exposure and

226

sample 2 for SNP-outcome with those in which sample 1 was used for SNP-outcome and sample 2

227

for SNP-exposure (Supplementary Methods).

228

Exploring the role of population stratification

229

Each additional allele in the insomnia PRS was associated with a variation of -0.004 (95% confidence

230

interval [CI]: -0.007, -0.001) year in age at recruitment, -3.7×10-7 (95% CI: -6.7×10-7, -6.4×10-8) metre

231

(M) in longitude of birthplace and 2.1×10-7 (95% CI: 5.7×10-8, 3.5×10-7) M in latitude of birthplace.

232

There was evidence of some variation in the mean PRS across 22 UKB assessment centres

233

(Supplementary Figure 2; P-value = 9.2×10-8). After adjusting for genetic array, top 40 genetic

234

principal components, participants’ age, birthplace and assessment centre, associations of the PRS

235

with height, BMI, education, frequency of alcohol consumption and ever smoking were not

236

attenuated (Figure 1) suggesting these associations are unlikely to be driven by PS. The association

237

of the insomnia PRS with age at first live birth was slightly attenuated to the null (Figure 1),

238

suggesting some of this may be due to confounding by PS. However, we obtained similar estimates

239

in the MR analyses before and after adjustment for sources of PS (Supplementary Table 2).

240

Distinguishing vertical from horizontal pleiotropy and accounting for horizontal pleiotropy

241

We searched for GWAS to identify genetic IVs for each of the six non-exposure traits that were

242

conducted in samples independent of UKB and had results presented in women only. However, we

243

were unable to find such GWAS of frequency of alcohol intake or ever smoking. Full details of the

244

selected SNPs are provided in Supplementary Data 1. We found that height, BMI and frequency of

245

alcohol consumption were more likely to reflect vertical pleiotropy or not associated with

246

birthweight (Figure 2), suggesting the associations of the PRS with them were unlikely to introduce

247

bias. These findings have some consistency with previous MR studies.(18, 43-45) However, age at first

248

live birth, education and ever smoking were plausible sources of horizontal pleiotropy (Figure 2).

249

After adjusting for these in MVMR, the effect estimates of insomnia on birthweight attenuated

250

towards the null compared to univariable MR (Figure 3), though results are imprecise.

251

In sensitivity analysis in one-sample MR, sisVIVE (full results in Supplementary Data 2) suggested that

252

the association of insomnia with birthweight was greater than seen with univariable TSLS (-87 [95%

consistent with the main IVW estimate, though for several the CIs were very wide; IVW, MR-PRESSO

255

and MR-TRYX supported an inverse association of maternal insomnia with offspring birthweight with

256

CIs that did not include the null (Figure 4). The MR-Egger intercept suggested little evidence of

257

unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy (p-value = 0.732 for dataset A on B and 0.763 for B on A; full

258

results in Supplementary Figure 3). Whilst between SNP heterogeneity was less when MR-TRYX was

259

used (in comparison to the IVW analyses) the point estimates were very similar between it and IVW

260

(Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 4).

261

Identifying more potential sources of violation of MR assumptions using a phenome-wide

262

approach

263

In this motivating example we only explored the six traits that we had a priori selected for checking,

264

based on prior knowledge that these were key risk factors for variation in birthweight. However,

265

there may be value in exploring a wider range of potential violating paths (recommendation 1).

266

Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive search for previously identified genome-wide significant

267

associations of the 80 SNPs in the insomnia PRS using Phenoscanner.(15) This amounted to 478

268

associations that included 42 SNPs, among which 34 SNPs were associated with at least one trait

269

apart from sleep (full results in Supplementary Data 3). We did not examine these further but

270

discuss in the discussion section the pros and cons of different approaches to identifying genetic IVs

271

associations with non-exposure traits.

272

Exploring reverse causality

273

Whilst temporally it is hard to conceive of birthweight influencing maternal insomnia, birthweight is

274

a proxy for fetal growth, which could influence maternal insomnia symptoms. To explore this

275

possibility, we would require offspring (fetal) genetic variants that are robustly related to their fetal

276

growth. Whilst there are no GWAS currently of maternal or fetal contribution to fetal growth (e.g.

277

assessed by repeat ultrasound scan) there are GWAS of own (i.e. fetal) genetic variants in relation to

Discussion

281

The possibility that genetic IVs for a specific exposure will associate with many other traits is

282

increasing as GWAS explore a larger number of SNPs in increasing sample sizes. In this paper we

283

have described different scenarios that could result in such associations and methods for exploring

284

where these may cause bias. Beyond confounding by PS, a key concern is attempting to differentiate

285

vertical from horizontal pleiotropy and using methods to explore and reduce bias from horizontal

286

pleiotropy. We provide a set of recommendations and demonstrate their use in an applied example

287

exploring the effect of maternal insomnia on birthweight.

288

This paper brings attention to the pros and cons of hypothesis-driven versus comprehensive

289

approaches to exploring IV validity. Our motivating example used researchers’ knowledge to decide

290

which non-exposure traits to explore genetic IVs associations with. Specifically, we chose six

291

observed traits in UKB that we considered plausible causes of offspring birthweight, and as our

292

analyses in this example shows they reflect plausible horizontal or vertical pleiotropic paths.

293

However, we have to rely on sensitivity analyses (see Table 2) to control for horizontal pleiotropy via

294

unexplored traits. This approach is efficient but cannot identify the nature of any unexplored

295

violation of instrument validity. Sensitivity analyses will identify whether results are likely to be

296

biased by unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy but if one wanted to explore specific known horizontal

297

or vertical (mediating) pleiotropy this approach would potentially miss some key paths. A further

298

limitation is that researchers’ knowledge is likely to vary between different researcher groups. An

299

alternative to a priori selecting a defined set of potential pleiotropic traits, is to use a Phenome-wide

300

search to systematically explore any possible non-exposure traits that associate with our genetic IVs.

301

This approach has the advantage that it is not limited by researchers’ own knowledge and the

302

variation in this between research groups. Although automated systems for rapid phenome-wide

303

associations now make a more extensive and systematic approach possible,(47-49) there are

304

challenges in applying our recommendations 3-5 to a possible large number of traits.

305

Of particular importance, when multiple different potential traits (exposure of interest and non-

306

exposure traits) and the relationship between them is being considered differing measurement error

307

in each trait may affect the results obtained. In MR and MVMR differing measurement error in

308

different traits gives the same effect as differing power in each trait and will lead to the effects of

309

traits measured with more error being less precisely estimated than the effects of those measured

310

with less error. However, Steiger filtering assumes that each trait is measured with the same error

311

and can give misleading results for the causal direction between two traits when the true causal

312

exposure is measured with more error than the true outcome. In our example self-report of

313

insomnia is likely to be measured with more error than several of the non-exposure traits

314

considered, in particular maternal height, BMI, age at first birth and education. For these traits

315

Stieger filtering may misleadingly suggest that the direction of effect is from these traits to insomnia

316

due to the imprecision in the measurement of insomnia. These issues are relevant to both the use of

317

prior knowledge to select specific traits to explore as possible pleiotropic paths and to a more

318

comprehensive and systematic phenome-wide scan approach. However, with the latter there are

319

many more non-exposure traits where these problems are likely to arise. In our illustrative example

320

the phenome-wide scan approach identified 478 non-exposure traits associated with one or more of

321

the 80 insomnia SNPs used in our genetic IV (i.e. 80-fold the six explored on the basis of prior

322

knowledge). On-the-one hand this suggests we might have missed some key specific pleiotropic

323

paths, on the other, even with the large sample size used in our example the potential for

324

uninterpretable imprecise results and possible misleading results is increased with the much larger

325

number from the phenome-wide scan.

326

Finally, the automated phenome-wide approach is dependent on the nature and quality of the

327

studies included in the searching tools (e.g. PhenoScanner(15) and GWAS Catalog(16)) and whilst they

328

are likely to identify more specific pleiotropic paths than knowledge based approaches, they may

329

still miss some important paths. Whether researchers decide to focus solely on a limited set of traits

330

that are known through prior knowledge to influence outcome and could be on a horizontal

331

pleiotropic path or undertake a phenome-wide approach will depend on the specific research

332

question, including whether that includes an interest in understanding the nature of horizontal

333

pleiotropic paths or mediation (vertical pleiotropy). It will also depend on available data. A

334

combination of both could be undertaken with some a prior decision to select a fixed number of the

335

non-exposure traits identified by the searching tool.

336

Our study provides guidance for further MR studies where genetic IVs were associated with multiple

337

traits. It may also be relevant to studies using non-genetic IVs (e.g. healthcare practitioner

338

preference(50) or randomization in a randomized control trials(51)). In addition to the approaches

339

outlined here to the situation of identifying that genetic IVs are related to multiple non-exposure

340

traits, we would recommend triangulating MR results with other methods that have different key

341

sources of bias to estimate causal effects.(52) If results are consistent across such different methods

342

that increases confidence in the result, even in the presence of remaining concerns about genetic IV

343

validity.
