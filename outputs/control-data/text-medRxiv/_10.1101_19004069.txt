Abstract
Background: Mindfulness interventions have not been rigorously evaluated in episodic migraine.
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) versus
stress management for headache (SMH).
Design, Setting, Participants: Randomized, assessor-blind, clinical trial of 98 adults with episodic
migraine recruited at a single academic center comparing MBSR+ (n=50) to SMH (n=48).
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02133209)
Intervention: MBSR+ and SMH were delivered weekly by group for 8 weeks, then bi-weekly for another
8 weeks.
Measurements: The primary outcome was reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks. MRI
outcomes included activity of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cognitive task network
during cognitive challenge, resting state connectivity of right dorsal anterior insula (daINS) to DLPFC and
cognitive task network, and gray matter volume of DLPFC, daINS, and anterior midcingulate. Secondary
outcomes were headache-related disability, pain severity, response to treatment, migraine days, and
MRI whole-brain analyses.
Results: Reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks was greater for MBSR+ (7.8 [95%CI, 6.98.8] to 4.6 [95%CI, 3.7-5.6]) than for SMH (7.7 [95%CI 6.7-8.7] to 6.0 [95%CI, 4.9-7.0]) (P=0.04). 52% of
the MBSR+ group showed a response to treatment (50% reduction in headache days) compared with
23% in the SMH group (P=0.004). Reduction in headache-related disability was greater for MBSR+ (59.6
[95%CI, 57.9-61.3] to 54.6 [95%CI, 52.9-56.4]) than SMH (59.6 [95%CI, 57.7-61.5] to 57.5 [95%CI, 55.559.4]) (P=0.02). There were no differences in clinical outcomes at 52 weeks or MRI outcomes at 20
weeks, although changes related to cognitive networks with MBSR+ were observed.
Limitations: A single site and likely self-selection bias.
Conclusions: MBSR+ is an effective treatment option for episodic migraine.

Introduction
Migraine is a severe and often disabling neurological disorder(1, 2) and standard preventative agents
frequently create challenging side-effects.(3, 4) Migraine guidelines(5) include nonpharmacological
preventative treatments, and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) recently has been shown to
improve pain and functional outcomes in chronic low back pain.(6) Yet meditation and mindfulness
therapies show only modest benefits to date in reducing the frequency of migraine.(7, 8) The outcomes
of MBSR in reducing pain(9) and migraine frequency(7) may improve if training is enhanced to include a
longer period of learning, as greater home practice yields better outcomes in MBSR.(10) Since
medication can contribute to the frequency of headache,(11) MBSR may be an effective
nonpharmacological prevention strategy that has become widely available throughout the United States
and Europe in recent years.
Migraine headaches are due to acute alterations in the trigeminovascular system and changes in brain
perfusion include widespread increases and decreases in brain activity.(12-14) Beyond the changes
known to occur during attacks, mild cognitive deficits occur between attacks(15, 16) and brain structure
is altered relative to controls.(17, 18) These brain changes involve cognitive and emotional circuits,(19)
particulary the insula,(20) left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior/mid cingulate cortex
(ACC/MCC).(21) The demands of recurring pain deplete cognitive and emotional resources,(22) and
treatments that increase the efficiency of information processing, or cognitive efficiency, may be
particularly beneficial for painful conditions such as migraine. The practice of mindfulness meditation
appears to increase cognitive efficiency. Long-term meditation practitioners show structural changes in
brain areas involved in cognitive and emotional processing (insula, ACC/MCC, and prefrontal cortex(23)),
and mindfulness training changes brain function in these and other areas, with consistent long-term
changes in insula cortex.(24, 25) The focused attention involved in mindfulness activates these cognitive
networks(26) and even brief mindfulness training improves cognitive efficiency and increases
engagement of left DLPFC.(27) Increased cognitive efficiency contributes to control over pain in longterm mindfulness practitioners.(28)
This trial compared enhanced MBSR (MBSR+) to an active control on clinical and imaging outcomes in
episodic migraine. We hypothesized that MBSR+ would reduce headache frequency (primary) and
reduce migraine-related disability (secondary). We also hypothesized that MBSR+ would alter the
structure and function of brain areas and networks involved in cognitive efficiency, including: increased
gray matter volume in the DLPFC, MCC, and insula; decreased activation of left DLPFC and cognitive task
network (known as the extrinsic mode network(29)) during cognitive challenge; and reduced resting
state connectivity from anterior insula to left DLPFC and cognitive task network.
Methods
The study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the University of
Maryland Baltimore Institutional Review Boards. Participants were recruited from local headache clinics,
primary care providers, and the community in eight cohorts (9-18 participants/cohort) from June 2014
to February 2017. Recruited individuals were 18 to 65 years of age and met International Classification
of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine with or without aura.(30) Eligibility was assessed first by
telephone (Figure 1), then a screening visit. Following written informed consent, screening established
>1 year history of a migraine diagnosis and excluded individuals who reported severe or unstable

psychiatric symptoms, used opioid medications, had prior experience with mindfulness or concurrent
treatment expected to affect mindfulness/stress reduction (see Protocol for full inclusion/exclusion).
Potential participants completed at least 28 days of an electronic daily diary to establish eligibility (4-14
headache days in 28 days) which served as the baseline measure of headache frequency. Eligible
subjects then attended the MRI session, including written informed consent, questionnaires, and
quantitative sensory testing.
Assessments
Study questionnaires were completed online at baseline, week 10 (after 8-weeks of MBSR+/SMH), week
20 (after completion of MBSR+/SMH), and at week 52. MRI visits at baseline, week 10, and week 20
were conducted by staff masked to treatment group. All MRI scans used a Siemens Tim-Trio 3T MRI
scanner with a 32-channel head coil through March 2017, then a Siemens 3T Prisma Fit MRI scanner
with a 64-channel head coil (see Appendix Table 1 for details). Scans included a T1 high resolution
anatomical scan, a resting state fMRI scan, and fMRI scans during completion of two blocks of painful
thermal stimulation and two blocks of cognitive challenge.(31)
Randomization
Randomization (1:1) was stratified by the presence/absence of another chronic pain disorder and
headache frequency from the baseline headache diary (low: 4-8; high: 9-14 headache days per 28 days).
The randomization schedule was generated online (randomization.com) and stored in a locked cabinet
by non-study staff. Assignment occurred by non-study staff when the participant arrived for the first
day of class.
Interventions
Participants were instructed to continue stable use of prescribed preventative treatments and continue
use of acute abortives as needed. Separate groups for each intervention met for about 2 hours weekly
for 8 weeks then bi-weekly for another 8 weeks. A trained expert in the content for each intervention
used a manualized protocol that included participant handouts and materials for home use. MBSR+ was
administered by 2 experienced, certified instructors (10 and 40 years of meditation experience). SMH
was delivered by a nurse practitioner (11 years experience treating headache patients). Checklists were
completed by instructors at the end of sessions to verify all components were delivered. Missed sessions
were made up individually in person or by phone.
MBSR+ included 2 segments: 1) MBSR included the 8-week program with retreat (32) adapted using
trauma-informed methods to include a longer arriving practice at each session and loving kindness in
week 2(33); and 2) 4 additional MBSR+ bi-weekly sessions emphasizing self-compassion and including
sympathetic joy, equanimity, and gratitude. The final traditional MBSR session focused on applying skills
before, during, and after migraines (see Appendix Methods) and the MBSR+ sessions included
both didactic content and mindfulness practice, including body scan, yoga, sitting and walking
meditations.
SMH included 12 sessions focused on didactic content about the role of stress and other triggers in
headaches and followed a smiliar format and timing to the MBSR+ sessions, minus the retreat. Topics
included stress at work and home; coping with stress mental health and personality; sleep hygiene; pain
education; and medications for migraine. Information, group discussion, and social support among

group members was emphasized; behavior change and specific skill development was not addressed.
Each session included a 10-minute period of standardized muscle stretching exercises.
Measures
Sociodemographic and medical data were obtained at baseline (Table 1). Clinical and imaging outcome
measures were collected at baseline, week 10 (secondary), and week 20 (primary) and clinical outcome
measures were collected at week 52 (secondary). The week 20 time point, along with the 28 day period
of prospective diaries that patients completed, conforms to current guidelines on RCTs for migraine
prophylaxis(34).
Primary Outcomes
Clinical Outcomes: The primary outcome was measured as the change from baseline to week 20.
Headache frequency was measured using an electronic daily diary for 28 days based on the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke preventive therapy headache diary, which was provided
via an email link. When fewer than the full 28 days were completed, the proportion of headache days
was calculated (number of headache days/total number of diary days) and then multiplied by 28 to get a
continuous variable for headache days. Note: in the clinical trial registration we included headacherelated disability as a primary outcome. However, given prior RCTs on migraine have almost exclusively
used headache frequency as the primary outcome, we chose to limit focus on that sole primary
outcome.
Imaging Outcomes: Brain function was measured as activation during cognitive task(31) performance in
left DLPFC and cognitive task network, and resting state connectivity of right dorsal anterior insula to left
DLPFC and cognitive task network. Brain structure was measured as gray matter volume in DLPFC,
cingulate, and anterior insula. Regions-of-interest were defined from the cognitive task group activation
map for all participants combined at baseline. Peak voxels for each region were selected, a 4mm radius
sphere was created, and data were extracted from the scan of interest for each subject.
Secondary outcomes
Clinical Outcomes: Secondary outcomes were assessed at weeks 10, 20, and 52. Headache-related
disability was measured using the six item Headache Impact Test(35) that shows strong psychometric
properties.(36) Headache intensity was computed as the average of all headache intensity ratings from
the electronic daily diary.(34) Response to treatment was defined as >50% reduction in number of
headache days(34) from baseline to week 20. A migraine(31) day was coded when at least 2 of the
following criteria were met: unilateral, pulsating, moderate/severe pain, aggravated by routine activity;
and at least one of the following criteria were met: nausea/vomiting or light/noise sensitivity
Imaging Outcomes: Whole brain analyses of gray matter volume, activation to pain, activation to
cognitive challenge, and resting state connectivity of the insula cortex were measured using Sandwich
estimator toolbox(37) (see Appendix).
Sample size
Using a 0.050 two-sided significance level, a sample of 90 subjects randomized to 2 treatment groups
(1:1) provides 80% power to detect an effect size of at least 0.60 in change of headache frequency for

MBSR+ relative to SMH using a t-test and the difference between a proportion of responders for MBSR
of 0.435 (20/45) and for SMH of 0.150 (7/45) using a Fisher's exact test.
Statistical Methods
Clinical outcomes were analyzed using the intention-to-treat approach. Effects of intervention were
estimated using mixed-effects models, where patient was a random effect, and fixed factors included
treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, age, cohort, interval in days between MRI and
treatment, medication, presence of other pain, and education. Difference in treatment response rate
was assessed using a generalized linear model with a logit link function. The regression model for the
mean with the binomial distribution variance function was utilized to model the log odds ratios. The
generalized linear models included the following covariates,: age, medication, level of education,
presence of other pain, interval in days between MRI and first intervention. A logistic regression model
predicted probability of response to treatment. P-values are nominal and not adjusted for multiple
outcomes. Testing was two-sided and used the 0.05 level of significance, and statistical analyses used RStudio, Version 1.1.453.
Imaging outcomes were analyzed per protocol and additional exclusion criteria for MRI data, sequence
information, data preprocessing, and first level analyses are described in Appendix. Linear mixed models
included patient as a random effect and fixed factors of treatment, time, and the treatment-by-time
interaction, and scanner as a covariate, with bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The
Sandwich estimator toolbox(37) modeled longitudinal changes in whole brain analyses. Statistical
significance was assessed using 10,000 iterations of wild bootstrap, and cluster-based correction for
multiple comparisons using a familywise error rate alpha of 0.05, with a cluster-forming threshold of
p<0.001. The contrast of interest was the treatment-by-time interaction. Main effects of time and
treatment are provided in Appendix.
Results
Among 573 individuals contacted for telephone screening, 168 were potentially eligible and 119 of these
met the headache frequency criteria during baseline (Figure 1). The main reasons for exclusion were not
meeting migraine or headache frequency criteria, ineligible or refused MRI/pain testing, schedule
incompatability, or migraine secondary to injury. Ninety eight participants were randomized to
treatment; 50 were assigned to receive MBSR+ and 48 were assigned to receive SMH. All attended at
least one session. Five participants (5%) withdrew from treatment after the first session but agreed to
continue with data collection and 3 participants (3%) withdrew from treatment and were lost to followup. Forty three (86%) of the MBSR+ participants and 40 (83%) of the SMH participants completed all
sessions, either in the group or individually as a make-up.
At baseline, treatment groups were similar on all sociodemographic characteristics (Table 1).
Participants (mean age of 36 years) were predominantly female (91%), white (72%), and 80% had
completed at least one year of college. At baseline, they reported an average of 7.8 headache days and
only 15% were using a preventive treatment for migraine. There were no group differences in treatment
withdrawal or loss to follow-up.
Primary outcomes

At week 20, the MBSR+ group reported fewer headache days (4.6 [95% CI 3.6 to 5.6]) compared to the
SMH group (6.0 [95% CI 4.9 to 7.0]; P=.04; Table 2). This effect was apparent at week 10, as the MBSR+
group reported fewer headache days (5.5 [95% CI 4.6 to 6.5]) compared to the SMH group (6.9 [95% CI
5.9 to 7.9] P=.04). This treatment effect was not significant at week 52 (P=.12).
Regions of interest revealed no significant treatment-by-time effects related to gray matter volume,
cognitive task activation, or resting state fMRI (Figure 3 and Appendix). Both groups showed decreased
anterior mid cingulate volume (P=.04) and decreased connectivity of right dorsal anterior insula to
cognitive task network (P=.02) at week 20.
Secondary outcomes
At week 20, the MBSR+ group also reported reduced HIT-6 scores (2.0 [95% CI 1.1 to 2.9]) compared to
the SMH group (3.7 [95% CI 2.7 to 4.7]; P=.04). Headache impact did not differ between treatment
groups at week 10 or week 52 (Table 2) and average headache pain intensity did not differ between
treatment group at any timepoint (Table 2). At week 20, 52% of the MBSR+ group were classified as
treatment responders (>50% reduction in headache days) compared to 23% of the SMH group
(P=0.004; Table 2, Figure 2), yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.4. The MBSR+ group reported
fewer migraine days at week 10 (P=.0008) and week 20 (P=.004) relative to SMH, but not at week 52
(Table 2).
Whole brain analyses revealed a significant treatment-by-time interaction on activation during the
cognitive challenge. The MBSR+ group showed decreased activation in the bilateral cuneus and right
parietal operculum at week 20 compared to the SMH group (Appendix Table 2). Whole brain analyses
also revealed a significant interaction of left dorsal anterior insula connectivity to the right posterior
parietal cortex and right cuneus (Appendix Table 2). There were no significant interaction effects for the
other five insula seed regions, gray matter volume, or activation during pain stimulation for the whole
brain analyses.
Adverse Events
There were 16 adverse events reported of which 15 were mild (e.g., high blood pressure, hives, jaw
pain) or moderate (e.g., car accident, kidney stone); the one serious adverse event (stroke), in
accordance with the data safety monitoring plan and consultation with the independent monitoring
committee, was deemed unlikely related to intervention. The remaining 7 were definitely not related, 7
were unlikely related, and 1 was possibly related to study procedures (one participant reported a
migraine during the MRI session).
Discussion:
Among adults with episodic migraine, enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) decreased
headache days and headache related disability, as well as yielded a higher treatment response rate,
relative to the active control (SMH). Treatment response (50% reduction in headache frequency) to
MBSR+ relative to SMH yielded an NNT of 3.4, which is comparable to valproic acid – one of the first line
treatments for episodic migraine prophylaxis.(38) These results hold promise for the use of mindfulnessbased interventions for headache, with treatment response rates qualitatively comparable or exceeding
effects of most existing standard pharmaceutical therapies in the time frames they have been
tested.(39-53) Developing and testing methods to sustain these benefits over longer periods is

warranted, as the effects of MBSR+ in reducing headache frequency did not sustain over the 52 week
follow-up.
Although no effects of MBSR+ training were observed on the primary neuroimaging outcomes,
secondary whole-brain analyses identified two findings that suggest an increase in cognitive efficiency.
Compared to SMH, MBSR+ training led to decreased activation of the parietal operculum and visual
cortex (cuneus) during the cognitive challenge. Both long-term meditators(55) and individuals trained in
MBSR(56) show altered visual cortex connectivity and increased activation during focused attention. The
parietal operculum, including posterior insula, is activated by pain and deactivated by cognitive
challenge(57) and we have previously reported that this is the only acute pain-related activation that is
modulated by cognitive demand in both healthy subjects and migraine patients.(21) Additionally, we
observed reduced resting connectivity of the dorsal anterior insula to posterior parietal cortex and visual
cortex (cuneus) following MBSR+ training compared to SMH. Because dorsal anterior insula strongly
connects to the posterior parietal cortex and cuneus as part of the cognitive task network,(58) this
finding supports increased cognitive efficiency following MBSR+. These increases in cognitive efficiency
seen in the MBSR+ group may reflect changes due to the practice of meditation or alternatively may
reflect the effect of having fewer headaches during the period surrounding measurement.
This is the first study to our knowledge using MRI primary outcomes in a registered clinical trial for a
chronic pain condition. The primary imaging outcomes, including changes in gray matter volume,
activation during cognitive challenge, and resting state connectivity of the anterior insula in a priori
selected regions-of-interest, did not differ between groups.. The choice of these regions was based on
literature when the study was proposed and our preliminary data, focusing on the DLPFC(59) and other
brain areas showing pain-cognition interactions.(21, 60-64) The vast majority of neuroimaging studies
compare individuals with chronic pain to healthy subjects, rather than longitudinal designs examining
how the brain changes with treatment. Since we did not find treatment effects in the areas that
distinguish those experiencing daily pain, our findings suggest that brain changes distinguishing patients
from healthy controls might not be useful as treatment targets.
Most MRI studies reporting effects of treatment have only investigated the treatment group,(64-67) or
treatment responders within a group exposed to treatment,(68-70) and ours is the first study to
compare two active treatment arms and including both treatment responsders and nonresponders. It is
possible that the results from previous studies examining brain changes over time are dependent on
treatment response, rather than the effects of intervention itself. Future work should thus include
comparisons of responders and non-responders.
The present findings share limitations common to most RCTs and may have limited generalizability due
to the likely selection bias that results from the strenuous requirements of participation, including time
commitment and willingness to complete repeated MRI scans, resulting in most of the participants being
college educated. Study strengths, in addition to the use of MRI outcomes, include one of the largest
sample sizes for measuring brain imaging outcomes in migraine or any chronic pain disorder, the very
small loss to follow-up, the close matching of MBSR+ to the active control, and long-term follow-up.
Conclusions:
In episodic migraine, MBSR+ showed superior treatment effects compared to an active control, with
significant reductions in headache frequency that are comparable to commonly used first line

treatments for episodic migraine prophylaxis. Brain changes in the MBSR+ group were seen in the
pattern of functional connectivity and activation during a challenging cognitive task that are consistent
with increased cognitive efficiency. These findings suggest that MBSR+ can be an effective prophylactic
treatment option for episodic migraine.

group map (all patients) for activation during the cognitive task. There were no significant effects of
treatment for region-of-interest analyses. B) whole-brain analysis interaction effect for cognitive taskrelated activation. Identified regions show a decrease in activation level in the MBSR+ compared to SMH
group over time. C) whole-brain analysis interaction effect for left dorsal aINS connectivity. Regions
show a decrease in activation level in the MBSR compared to SMH group over time. Images are
displayed on the average anatomical MRI for all patients at baseline. Error bars are 95% confidence
intervals.
