1 Abstract
Background: Norovirus outbreaks are notoriously explosive, with dramatic symptomology and rapid disease spread. Children are particularly vulnerable to infection and
drive norovirus transmission due to their high contact rates with each other and the
environment. Despite the explosive nature of norovirus outbreaks, attack rates in schools
and daycares remain low with the majority of students not reporting symptoms.
Methods: We explore immunologic and epidemiologic mechanisms that may underlie
epidemic norovirus transmission dynamics using a disease transmission model. Towards
this end, we compared different model scenarios, including innate resistance and acquired
immunity (collectively denoted ‘immunity’), stochastic extinction, and an individual
exclusion intervention. We calibrated our model to daycare and school outbreaks from
national surveillance data.
Results: Recreating the low attack rates observed in daycare and school outbreaks
required a model with immunity. However, immunity alone resulted in shorter duration
outbreaks than what was observed. The addition of individual exclusion (to the immunity
model) extended outbreak durations by reducing the amount of time that symptomatic
people contribute to transmission. Including both immunity and individual exclusion
mechanisms resulted in simulations where both attack rates and outbreak durations were
consistent with surveillance data.
Conclusions: The epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks in daycare and school settings
cannot be well described by a simple transmission model in which all individuals start as
fully susceptible. Interventions should leverage population immunity and encourage more
rigorous individual exclusion to improve venue-level control measures.

3 Background
Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis across all ages in the United States
(US), with 19 to 21 million cases occurring per year [1]. The role of children in its transmission has recently been highlighted in a mathematical modeling analysis [2], which
found that pediatric vaccination would result in substantially higher protective populationlevel effects when compared with vaccination of the elderly. This finding highlights the
propensity of children in daycares and schools to cause explosive outbreaks and subsequently to propagate disease into the community through person-to-person transmission
[3–10]. Here we examine how norovirus spreads within schools and daycare centers to
inform the potential design of effective venue-specific interventions to ultimately reduce
population-level risk.
Norovirus transmission can occur directly through person-to-person contact [11] and indirectly through water [12], food [13], or fomite-mediated pathways [14–17]. Symptomatic
individuals efficiently spread virus through vomiting and defecation [17]. After symptoms
resolve, individuals continue to shed for an average of ∼2 weeks [18]. Norovirus transmission is sustained through the combination of efficient and prolonged human shedding
[17], and extended environmental persistence [19–22]. Additionally, norovirus is highly
infectious, with an infectious dose of 18-2800 virions being sufficient to cause infection,
while peak viral concentration per gram of stool reach levels of 109 [23, 24]. These features
of transmission as well as a lack of long-lasting immunity in human hosts [25, 26], con-

tribute to venue-level norovirus outbreaks potentially exhibiting rapid, explosive growth
rates [27, 28]. These explosive epidemic growth rates would be expected to correspond
to high attack rates with exhaustion of susceptibles, similar to other highly transmissible
diseases like measles [29, 30]. However, despite this explosive tendency and the important
role that children play in transmission, attack rates (ARs) in daycare and school outbreaks
are relatively low (∼22% to ∼15% in daycares and schools, respectively, based on data
from the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) [31]).
While the transmission of other explosive diseases, such as measles, may be often be
captured through simple susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models in which all individuals start as fully susceptible, norovirus does not result in exhaustion of susceptibles,
suggesting that a more complex transmission process may be occurring. One distinction
between norovirus and measles is that norovirus immunity is strain dependant and not permanent, so that norovirus outbreaks often occur in populations with immunity. This raises
the question of whether population-level immunity is sufficient to explain the norovirus
outbreak patterns that we observe.
There are multiple explanations for the combination of explosive outbreaks and low ARs
observed in outbreak data. First, ∼20% of the US population lack a functional FUT2 gene,
conferring innate resistance to certain norovirus genotypes [32]. Furthermore, depending
on age, up to ∼90% of children < 5 years of age have norovirus antibodies titers potentially indicating acquired immunity [33, 34], although the level of protection conferred
by these antibodies is not known and the levels of acquired immunity may fluctuate in
part due to the genetic drift of norovirus strains [35]. Second, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends various interventions to prevent and control
norovirus outbreaks, including isolation of individuals during and 1 to 3 days following
the symptomatic period [36] which may also reduce transmission [37]. Finally, stochastic
extinction may lead to outbreaks ending without exhaustion of susceptibles, especially for

smaller populations [38] e.g. daycares. Any combination of these factors may contribute
to low ARs within venues.
In this paper, we employ mathematical models to explore underlying mechanisms leading
to disease transmission dynamics that can explain the observed norovirus epidemiology
within daycare and school venues. Given the epidemiological features discussed above, explaining norovirus dynamics requires a detailed representation of the mechanisms driving
transmission. Here, we examine which mechanisms are sufficient to explain the epidemiological patterns seen in outbreaks using a transmission model calibrated to CDC NORS
surveillance data.

5 NORS Dataset
We calibrated our model to outbreak duration (in days), student AR, and student population size data from NORS, a CDC-managed internet-based surveillance system through
which state, territorial, and local health departments within the US can enter outbreak information [31, 39] (See Appendix Table S6 for summary statistics of dataset). Our dataset
includes all school and daycare outbreaks in NORS that occurred from 2009–2016 which
indicated norovirus as the only suspected or confirmed etiology. We classified a given
venue as daycare or school based on self-reported classification by the reporting agency
[40]. In total, there were 989 school outbreaks and 329 daycare outbreaks, which comprised 4.6% of all outbreaks reported through NORS during 2009–2016 (i.e., 1,318 of
28,580 total outbreaks across all modes and etiologies). We only included outbreaks with
complete data (i.e., not missing for total students exposed, AR, and outbreak start and

to remove outliers and to calibrate our model to data generally representative of common norovirus outbreaks. Our final calibration dataset consisted of 562 total norovirus
outbreaks.

extension of [2]. All analyses were conducted in R version 3.2.4 [41].

Figure 1: Model schematic: All compartments involved in the force of infection (Equation
1) are in light gray. The full force of infection equation is also shown in the figure above.
Susceptible individuals (S) may be infected and pass through a latent period (E1 to E3 )
before becoming symptomatically (I) or asymptomatically infectious (A1 to A3 ). Once recovered from asymptomatic infection, individuals become fully immune (R). Note, there
is no waning immunity due to the fact that we are simulating over a short timescale (i.e.,
60 days). At the start of the outbreak some individuals may be fully immune (R) due
to innate resistance or partially immune (P ) due to acquired immunity. Social distancing or individual exclusion is represented by X. During infection, individuals may shed
pathogens onto environmental fomites (F1 ). As pathogens on the fomites decay, they move
to (F2 ), together the two fomite compartments represent biphasic decay of norovirus in the
environemnt. All parameter values are shown in Table 1.

5.1.1 Transmission Model for Daycare centers and Schools

Transmission occurs directly through person-to-person contact or indirectly through
fomite-mediated pathways i.e., shedding and pickup of virions in the environment (in
this analysis, we are not simulating foodborne or waterborne transmission). Individuals
start as susceptible S, partially immune P , or have innate resistance (and start as fully
recovered) R depending on the initial conditions (Figure 1). Susceptible and partially immune individuals become infected according to the force of infection λ(t), which is derived

from the number of symptomatic individuals (I), asymptomatic individuals (A1 , A2 , and
A3 ), environmental pathogens residing on fomites (F1 and F2 ), and the human-to-human
(βHH ) and fomite-to-human (βF H ) transmission rate parameters. The parameter βA represents the reduction in efficiency of asymptomatic transmission compared with symptomatic
transmission. Excluded individuals do not contribute to the force of infection:

λ(t) = [I + βA (A1 + A2 + A3 )]βHH + (F1 + F2 )βF H ,

(1)

Infected individuals move through a gamma-distributed latent period (E1 , E2 , and E3 )
which represents the distribution of the incubation times in the literature [42]. Individuals
then become either symptomatic or asymptomatic [43]. The gamma-distributed asymptomatic period represents post-symptomatic shedding and exhibits reduction in shedding
by stage (e.g., individuals in A2 shed less than individuals in A1 ). Partially-immune individuals can become infected, but not diseased (symptomatic). Symptomatic individuals
may become excluded (X) until 2 days after their symptoms resolve and do not contribute
to transmission while they are excluded. All non-excluded symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals shed pathogen into the environment (in the venue). Norovirus pathogen decay
on fomites occurs in a biphasic pattern with an initial rapid die-off followed by a period of
slower decay [19, 44]. Finally, all individuals who become infected eventually progress to
fully recovered. See Appendix Table S1 for initial condition ranges, and Section S2 for the
model description and equations.

To reduce parameter space and the number of simulations required to calibrate the model,
we fixed the values of parameters that have been estimated in the literature (i.e., µ, θ, φ,
ρ, σ, and qT ime). If there was no information about a given parameter (i.e., αI , ξ, βA ,βHH ,

Model Scenarios

We considered the following scenarios to examine mechanisms that can recreate the features of norovirus transmission:
• Baseline Model: The outbreak starts in a fully susceptible population.
• Immunity Model: The outbreak starts in a population where 20% of individuals
have innate resistance [32] and between 0 and 80% of individuals have acquired

immunity (depending on the sampled initial condition values, see Section S5). There
is no individual exclusion.
• Individual Exclusion Model: The outbreak starts in a fully susceptible population.
Symptomatic individuals can become excluded (X) and these individuals do not
contribute to transmission.
• Combined Model: The outbreak starts in a population with immunity (i.e., innate
resistance and acquired immunity) and contains symptomatic individuals that can
become excluded.
See Appendix Section S3 for more details about the model scenarios. All models were
simulated in daycares and schools. We randomly sampled starting population sizes from
the distribution of exposed student populations in the NORS data (Table S6). To address
assumptions about our modeling framework, we conducted sensitivity analyses. First, we
looked to see whether specific initial conditions influence our results in our best-calibrated
model. We varied whether the outbreak was initiated by an infected individual entering
the venue or by differing amounts of contamination in the environmental. Second, we
looked to see whether including staff in addition to student transmission influenced our
conclusions (see Appendix Sections S11 and S12 for details).

5.3 Calibration
We calibrated each venue–specific model separately to its corresponding NORS data using sample-importance-resampling [47]. This approach allowed us to obtain an array of
parameter sets that best recreate the NORS data distribution.
Sample-importance-resampling is a three-step procedure. In the ‘sample’ stage we ran the

10

model with 10,000 randomly sampled parameter and initial condition sets (collectively
denoted ‘parameter sets’, and listed in Table 1) from pre-defined ranges using Latin Hypercube Sampling [48]. Each parameter set was run in a school setting and separately, in
a daycare setting. Next, in the ‘importance’ stage, we calculated a likelihood to determine
how well each parameter set corresponds to the NORS data. Our likelihood compared
the 3-dimensional probability distribution of the student ARs, student population size, and
outbreak durations from the model to NORS data. We also examined the effects of weakening our prior (i.e., our best guess pre-defined parameter ranges) on the results. Finally,
in the ‘resampling’ stage we resampled the parameter sets 2,500 times with replacement
using the likelihoods as weights to obtain a final array of parameter sets. See Appendix
Section S6 for more details on calibration and the effects of weakening our prior.
As described above, we considered two versions of the model and calibration—one model
which included only students (using the student AR and population data), and a second
sensitivity analysis that included staff members and students separately in the model (see
Appendix Section S12 for details). The overall outbreak duration was used for calibration
in both model versions. Calibrating the staff and student model was substantially more
computationally expensive than the student-only model. Additionally, the full calibration
results for the staff and student model were similar to the student-only model (see below
and Appendix Section S12), and so for simplicity we present only the student model here
and the model with the staff included is presented as a sensitivity analysis in the appendix.
To determine the best-fitting model, we derived a kernal density estimate of the calibrated
model results (namely the density of resamples across AR, population size, and outbreak
durations), and calculated the Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the difference between the each calibrated model and NORS kernal density estimate [49]. We also examined pairwise scatter plots of ARs, outbreak durations, and population sizes for resampled
model runs and compared them to the NORS data to assess the calibration graphically.

6.1

NORS Data

Our final dataset (after removing incomplete data and outliers) consisted of 165 daycare
outbreaks and 397 school outbreaks. The median student population, AR, and outbreak
duration for daycare outbreaks were 80 people (range: 7, 410), 21.5% (range: 4.6%,
69.2%), and 13 days (range: 2, 40 days), respectively. The median population, AR, and
duration for school outbreaks were 420 people (range: 6, 6486), 15.3% (range: 4.6%,
68.4%) and 8 days (range: 1, 32 days), respectively. See Appendix Table S6 for details.

6.2

Calibration

We found that the fully uninformed prior resulted in the best graphical fit and lowest
Kullback-Leibler divergence (discussed in Appendix Section S7). The graphical results of
the calibration are shown in the Appendix Section S10 and the Kullback-Leibler divergence
for each model is given in Table 2.

Model Comparisons

Figure 2 shows the median attack rates and durations for the NORS data and each of
the models. Overall, the combined model matched the NORS data best both graphically
and according to Kullback-Leibler divergence (see Figure 3 and Appendix Figures S10 for
scatter plots showing model results compared with NORS data and Table 2 for all KullbackLeibler divergences). In the combined model, the daycare and school-aged ARs had medians of 20% (CI: 2.6% to 57.1%) and 14.3% (95% CI: 2.1% to 52.7%), respectively. These

are slightly lower, but relatively consistent with the NORS ARs which were 21.5% (range:
4.6% to 69.2%) and 15.3% (range: 4.6% to 68.4%) for daycares and schools, respectively.
The daycare and school outbreak durations were 12 days (95% CI: 2 to 36) and 10 days
(95% CI: 3 to 31), respectively. These ranges are somewhat smaller, but generally consistent with the NORS outbreak durations which were 13 days (range: 2 to 40) and 8 days
(range: 1 to 32) for daycares and schools, respectively. Results for the other models that
did not calibrate as well are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

Overall, the baseline model which examined the effects of stochasticity alone (i.e., in the
absence of immunity and individual exclusion) resulted in ARs being too high and outbreak
durations being too short compared with the NORS data. Among the mechanisms we examined, population immunity (included in the immunity and combined models) was best
able to recreate relatively low ARs observed in the NORS data (Table 3). This is because
individuals who are partially immune may become infected, but not symptomatic. Even
though these individuals contribute to transmission, they are not detected as diseased and
do not count in the overall AR. On the other hand, the individual exclusion mechanism (included in the individual exclusion and combined models) resulted in durations that were

Table 2: Kullback Leibler divergence for each model compared with the NORS data kernel density estimated distribution. Smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence indicates a more
similar distribution to NORS (i.e. less information difference between the NORS and the
model distribution). The combined model is shown in bold. The sensitivity analyses include varying the environmental contamination at the start of the outbreak (‘Seeding:
Varying Pathogens in Environment’), and seeding with a single diseased individual (‘Seeding: Diseased Individual’)
more consistent with NORS data. Specifically, individual exclusion led to longer outbreak
durations (see Appendix Table 4) indicating that it may slow the spread of norovirus. Excluded individuals transmit for a shorter time while they are symptomatic (i.e., between 1
hour and 1 day before being excluded) compared with non-excluded individuals (i.e., 1.25
days). This reduction in transmission time likely prevents the outbreak from spreading as
fast as the baseline or immunity models. Individual exclusion also provides populationlevel protection from becoming symptomatic (as indicated by the reduction in individual
exclusion ARs compared with the baseline model).

Each single mechanism model can account for single aspect of the NORS data. Specifically, immunity can recreate the NORS attack rates and individual exclusion can recreate
the NORS outbreak durations. Furthermore, examining the pairwise comparison between
attack rates and populations and durations and populations, we can see that the immunity
and combined models best match the NORS data. See Appendix Figures S2, S3, S5, and
S6 for populations plotted against attack rates and outbreak durations. Because of the
balance in fit of these different features, the combined model performed best according to
the Kullback-Leibler divergence (see Table 2 ).
For all models, the median outbreak durations were less than the average time it took the
first incident cases to fully recover (i.e., less than the ∼ 16-day infectious period), which
meant that outbreaks tended to end within a single infectious period indicating a rapid
(explosive) spread of disease within venues. Therefore, both the combined and immunity
models provided a mechanism for explosive outbreaks that did not result in the entire
population becoming diseased.

Sensitivity Analyses

We examined how results changed when simulating different initial conditions and also,
including staff transmission. First, starting with different initial conditions using the com-

bined model (seeding with an infected individual or varying the number of pathogens
starting in the environment) led to similar model results compared with the original model.
See Appendix Sections S11, and S12 for more details, and Tables S7 and S8 for ARs and
durations. Second, the student and staff model had qualitative results consistent with the
main analysis. Specifically, among calibrated parameter sets, although median results were
closer than the student only model to the NORS data for certain model scenarios (e.g. the
attack rates of the baseline model), the overall behavior of each scenario was consistent.
This is evidenced by the attack rate ranges being wider for the immunity model, and the
outbreak duration ranges being wider for the individual exclusion model. Overall, the student and staff model was consistent with our overall results in that the combined model
calibrated best to the NORS data (see Appendix section S12 for details).

7 Discussion
Although norovirus is classically characterized by explosive outbreaks, its epidemiology
exhibits interesting properties that are not captured by simple SIR models starting with a
fully susceptible population. The NORS data has lower attack rates and longer durations
than were observed in our baseline model alone. An interesting characteristic of norovirus
is that a portion of the population exhibits immunity that provides some degree protection. Immunity to norovirus (either innate or post-exposure) is well known, our analysis
suggests that this process may be sufficient to explain the observed general pattern of
explosive norovirus outbreaks but relatively low ARs within venues. However, this mechanism alone resulted in outbreak durations that were substantially faster than what we
observed in the data. Another interesting feature of norovirus outbreaks, due to the short
but intense symptomatic phase, is that individual’s choose to and/or are asked to exclude
themselves from the general population. This exclusion appears to slow transmission and

result in lower attack rates, but does not produce a wide distribution of attack rates in
our model. For this reason, the combined model (with both immunity and individual exclusion) was able to generate a wider distribution of outbreaks with both low attack rates
and longer outbreak durations and therefore matched the NORS data most closely. These
findings suggest that partial population immunity and exclusion of ill individuals are important mechanisms that contribute to the observed characteristics of reported norovirus
outbreaks.
These results are based on an analysis of the NORS dataset in conjunction with a transmission model. Both the data and the model come with assumptions and limitations.
With respect to the data, NORS relies on passive surveillance, which means there is underreporting of outbreaks that likely results in the distribution of ARs and durations not being
representative of the general trends in the population [11]. Second, the amount of missing
data (only 562 of the initial 1,318 outbreak were complete and therefore included) could
result in bias. Third, interventions (e.g. decontamination) were likely implemented in
many of the reported outbreaks, but the majority (¿ 90%) did not report on this. Fourth,
the exposed population reported (i.e., the denominator of the ARs) may correspond to
a single classroom, grade-level or entire school, and is not consistent across outbreaks
(and the method of determining the exposed population is not specified). This may result in lower ARs (if the exposed population is overestimated) and could have substantial
effects on how well our models calibrate. To address this, in our initial exploration of
the NORS data, we plotted ARs vs. duration while stratifying on exposed population size
(for populations < 200) and found that the overall distribution appeared similar across
strata (see Appendix Figure S1). Lastly, classifications of school or daycare venues relied
on self-reporting. Many venues have a mixture of different age groups and therefore,
classifications were likely not consistent.
Our analytical methods include a wide range of assumptions required to generate a parsi19

monious model. First, we did not explicitly include the processes of waning immunity and
the existence of different norovirus strains because we are simulating a single outbreak.
These processes are represented in our model by varying the distribution of individuals
who start as immune compared with fully susceptible. Second, we assume that partially
immune individuals may become infected, but not diseased. In reality, individuals with
acquired immunity may become symptomatic or asymptomatic. However, altering the relative proportion of asymptomatic vs. symptomatic individuals i.e., by varying the initial
conditions of those who start as partially immune should account for these effects. Third,
we used a compartmental rather than individual-based structure, which does not include
explicit contact network effects such as clustering and degree heterogeneity. One form of
contact heterogeneity is the different transmission rates for staff and students—while our
main model did not include staff transmission, the staff and student sensitivity analysis
included these features and had results consistent with the main analysis i.e., immunity
allows for a wider range of attack rates and individual exclusion allows for a wider range
of outbreak durations. For more details see Appendix Section S12. Finally, we assume that
each outbreak is seeded in the environment with a set number of pathogens. We explored
variations to this in sensitivity analyses altering initial seeding (1) with a single infected
individual and (2) varying the number of pathogens starting in the environment. These
additional analyses did not substantially change the results (see Appendix Section S11).
Future analyses should consider how interventions can leverage the fact that innate and
partial immunity, as well as individual exclusion may shape outbreak patterns. The importance of innate and acquired immunity in reducing attack rates supports the current
approach to implement a vaccine and also may be factored into the design of vaccination
programs (because ∼ 20% of the population already has innate immunity). The observation that individual exclusion leads to slower transmission, suggests that other interventions like decontamination can work in conjunction with individual exclusion to stop

S1 Supplementary Information

S2 Transmission Model for Daycare Centers and Schools
Transmission occurs either directly through person-to-person contact or indirectly through
fomite-mediated pathways i.e., shedding and pickup of virus in shared environments. Individuals start as either susceptible S, partially immune P , or fully recovered R depending
on acquired immunity and innate resistance status (Figure 1). Susceptible and partially immune individuals become infected according to the force of infection λ(t), which is based
on: (1) the number of symptomatic (I), and asymptomatic (A1 , A2 , and A3 ) individuals;
(2) the number of pathogens on fomites in the environment (F1 and F2 ); (3) the human
to human and fomite to human transmission rates (βHH ; and βF H ); and (4) The asymptomatic transmission reduction factor (βA ) which reduces the efficiency of transmission
compared with symptomatic individuals. Excluded individuals, X, do not contribute to
transmission.
Force of Infection

λ(t) = [I + βA (A1 + A2 + A3 )]βHH + (F1 + F2 )βF H

(2)

Once infected, individuals pass through a gamma distributed latent period i.e. E1 , E2 ,
and E3 . It is gamma distributed to represent the empirical distribution of incubation times
[42] in the literature. After they pass through the latent period, they become symptomatic.
After an individual is symptomatic, they pass through a gamma distributed asymptomatic
period i.e., A1 , A2 , and A3 that represents post-symptomatic shedding and exhibits a reduction in shedding by stage (e.g., individuals in A2 shed less than individual in A1 , see

below for details). A proportion of infected individuals who originate in S do not become
symptomatic and pass directly from E3 to A1 . Individuals who start as partially immune
can become infected, but do not become symptomatic and move directly to A1 .
A proportion of symptomatic individuals become excluded and move into the X compartment. After their symptoms resolve, they move to A1 and return to the general population with the normal transmission and shedding rates for the A1 compartment. Finally,
all individuals who become infected eventually progress to the fully recovered state. All
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (unless excluded) shed pathogen into the environment as follows:

Shedding = αI I + αI βA (A1 e−σ( φ ) + A2 e−σ( φ + ρ ) + A3 e−σ( φ + ρ + ρ ) )
F˙1 = Shedding − ξF1

(3)

F˙2 = ξF1 − ξF2
where αI is the shedding rate for symptomatic individuals, and the reduction factors for
shedding among asymptomatic individuals is βA .
The amount of shedding is reduced exponentially as individuals progress across the gamma
distributed asymptomatic period by σ for each state transition [23]. The symptomatic
period, φ, and the recovery rate, ρ (i.e., from A1 to A2 etc.), account for the length of time
that individuals shed at certain rates.
Viral concentration on fomites is tracked in the venue. Norovirus pathogen decay on
fomites occurs in a biphasic pattern with an initial rapid rate of die-off followed by a
period of slower die-off [19, 44]. Since we are simulating a single outbreak, waning immunity is ignored. See Appendix Section S4 for the full model equations, Table S1 for
initial condition ranges, and Table 1 for parameter ranges.

S3 Model Features
We incorporated different model features to examine mechanisms that can recreate the
explosive outbreaks and low ARs characteristic of norovirus. We considered the following
models (see Figure 1 for reference):
• Baseline Model: In this scenario, we simulated a fully susceptible population, with
no individual exclusion. All individuals started in the susceptible, S, compartment.
• Immunity Model: In this scenario, we simulated partial population immunity with
no individual exclusion. Because there is strain-dependent variation in the amount
of protection innate resistance provides [32], and due to the fact that there is not an
established correlate of norovirus protection that would be able to quantify acquired
partial immunity, we examined different proportions of immunity. We assumed that
those with innate resistance could not become infected at all and started as fully
immune (in the R compartment), while those with acquired immunity started as
partially immune (in P ). Individuals in P could become infected, but not diseased.
Non-diseased individuals were assumed to not be detectable during norovirus outbreaks and therefore were not counted in the numerator of the attack rate. Twenty
percent of the population started in the R compartment i.e., with innate resistance
[32], and we varied the total number with acquired immunity (P ). We chose to
vary the percentage starting with acquired immunity, because again there is not a
well established correlate of protection [50]. Finally, we calibrated the proportion of
individuals with acquired immunity to the data by sweeping over a broad range of
Latin Hypercube Sampled [48] values (Table 1).
• Individual Exclusion Model: In this scenario, we simulated a fully susceptible population (i.e., all individuals started in the S compartment) with individual exclusion.

During the simulation, a proportion of diseased individuals were removed from normal mixing and shedding, i.e., excluded. Excluded individuals do not contribute to
transmission.
• Combined Model: In this scenario, we simulated partial population immunity, with
individual exclusion.
Each of the above approaches were simulated stochastically. The stochastic simulation is
a tau leaping version of the model [51] based on the Gillespie algorithm in which the
stochastic model is approximate, but more efficient. The proportion of individuals across
disease states is updated at each large predefined time step (the time interval is denoted
τ ). We then ran the model 10 times using different random number generator seeds for
each parameter set and population size to account for stochastic variation.

S5 Initial Conditions
In the baseline model, we start all individuals as Susceptible (S). In the immunity and
combined models, 20% of individuals start as fully recovered (R) and some proportion of
individuals start with partial immunity (P ). This proportion is randomly sampled between
0 and 80%. Finally, 10 million pathogens start in the F1 compartment to initiate the
outbreak. However, this number was varied from 0 to 100 million in a sensitivity analysis.
Another sensitivity analysis seeded the outbreak with a single infectious individual.

S6 Calibration
We calibrated each venue–specific model separately to its corresponding NORS data using
sample-importance-resampling [47]. This approach allowed us to obtain an array parameter sets upon which, if the model is run will recreate the NORS data distribution to the
best ability of the model.

S6.1

Initial Sample:

We ran the model with 10,000 randomly sampled parameter and initial condition sets (collectively denoted ‘parameter sets’, and listed in Table 1) using Latin Hypercube Sampling
[48]. Each parameter set was run in a school setting and separately, in a daycare setting.
The only distinction between the model setup for schools and daycares was the starting
population size (the sets of parameter values are the same), which is taken from the NORS
outbreak data in the corresponding setting (Table S6). The NORS data includes separate
attack rates (ARs) and populations for students and staff, but only one overall outbreak
duration.
For a given venue–specific model, parameter sets were excluded from calibration if the
outbreak was ongoing when the simulation ended (i.e., > 60 days, set according to the
NORS data). We note that all the outbreaks in the NORS calibration dataset had ended by
this point (the maximum duration was 40 days for daycare and 32 days for schools).

S6.2

Calculating the Likelihood:

We derived 2 kernel density estimates of the 3-dimensional probability distribution of the
student ARs, student population size, and outbreak durations: one for NORS, KDEN ORS ,
and one for the model results (generated based on our parameter ranges), KDEM odel . The
kernel density estimates were computed using the KS package in R which was designed for
kernel smoothing of multidimensional data [53, 54]. We first derived the likelihood from
the KDEN ORS value only and calibrated (fully informed prior). Next, because the predefined parameter ranges in the model represented our subjective best-guesses (i.e., our
prior), we used KDEM odel (the model-derived kernel density estimate) to examine how
weakening our prior (i.e., making it more uninformed) might affect results. Specifically,
the likelihood estimate of a given parameter set was calculated by taking the NORS kernel
density estimate value which corresponded to a given AR, population size, and outbreak
duration from the model results and dividing that by the model kernel density estimate
value i.e., we plugged our model outputs into both of these kernel density estimates, resulting in a fully uninformed (bounded uniform) prior. In other words, we looked up
how likely our model results were to appear in the NORS data and divided by how likely
our model results were in the entire pool of model results (wherein the shape of this
pool of results is directly affected by our prior). By doing this, we effectively canceled
the over-weighting of certain model results that occurred due to our parameter ranges.
We subsequently investigated how results change when reducing the effect of the model
kernel density estimate by using the following hill function:

Likelihood =

KDEN ORS [ARmodel , P opulationmodel , Durationmodel ]
KDEM odel [ARmodel , P opulationmodel , Durationmodel ] + C

(7)

where [ARmodel , P opmodel , Durationmodel ] represent indices used to lookup the corresponding KDEN ORS value (i.e., to determine how likely our model results are to appear in the

NORS data) and KDEmodel value. C was the set to equal the 25th , 50th , 75th percentiles of
all KDEmodel values to explore how weaker or stronger priors might affect calibration (i.e.,
as C increases the prior the effect of our predefined parameter ranges become stronger).
For each simulation, the AR was defined as the total number of symptomatic individuals
divided by the total population and the outbreak duration was defined as the number of
days from the first symptomatic incident case to the last symptomatic incident case.

S6.3

Deriving our posterior

Finally, we resampled the parameter sets 2,500 times with replacement using the likelihoods as weights to obtain a final array of parameter sets that, if used as inputs for the
model, could most closely recreate the NORS data distribution.

S6.4

Calibration and Selecting a Prior

We initially calibrated using with a fully informed prior i.e., we looked up model outputs
in KDEN ORS only (and did not divide by KDEM odel ). We found that although the models
were generally able to recreate the distribution of the NORS data, the large majority of parameter sets yielded model results in specific regions of the NORS data distribution. Therefore, the majority of resampled parameter sets were taken from these regions and resulted
in results (specifically outbreak durations) that were not consistent with the NORS data.
See Appendix Section S7.1 for attack rates, durations, and Kullback-Leibler divergence
from the fully informed prior analysis. The fact that model results were over-represented
in specific regions was likely due to our pre-selected parameter ranges, therefore we explored whether making the prior weaker (i.e., plugging model outputs into KDEM odel and

calculating likelihoods with the hill function see Appendix Table S7.1 for results) might
improve calibration.

S7 Selecting a Prior Results
We initially calibrated each model scenario to the NORS data without accounting for the
distribution of model results. In other words, likelihoods were calculated based on how
well the model results match the NORS data only. We next examined how weakening the
prior might improve model calibration to NORS data.
Below are Kullback-Leibler divergence values for different values of C in the likelihood hill
function (see Equation 7).

Although the initial Latin Hypercube sampled simulations of the combined model were
able to recreate almost the entire joint distribution of ARs and durations observed in the
NORS data, a large fraction of the these simulations had very short outbreak durations
(and these short duration simulations were weighted highly in the sample-importanceresampling as they are also common in NORS). This skewed the calibrated distributions
of durations in the combined model toward the shorter-duration end of the NORS data, so
that the median model-generated durations were lower than those in NORS. Therefore, for

a model to be able to calibrate well, it is required to both (1) recreate the joint distribution
of attack rates and durations in the NORS data, and (2) evenly distribute model runs
across the distribution. This led us to examine how weaker priors accounting for the
distribution of model results might improve the calibration. We found that the model
scenarios consistently performed the approximately same relative to each other (e.g., the
combined model always performed better than the baseline model)regardless of which
prior we used (see Appendix Table S7.1). We ultimately chose to present results from a
fully uninformed prior (see Equation 7 with C=0) because this yielded the best overall fit
both graphically and with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence.

S11 Sensitivity Analyses Related to Initial Conditions
We conducted sensitivity analyses to ensure that our model results were robust to key
simplifying assumptions. To assess whether the outbreak durations were affected by the
choice of initial conditions in different compartments, we conducted two sensitivity analyses. First, we ran the model varying the number of pathogens starting in the environment
from 0 to 100 million and second, we seeded the model with a single infectious individual.

S11.1

Sensitivity Analysis Results:

According to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, all sensitivity analyses performed fairly well
and were relatively close to the original combined model. Overall, the combined was
lower according to Kullback-Leibler divergence in the daycare model, but seeding varying
pathogens in the the environment had a lower Kullback-Leibler divergence in the school
model. See Table 2 for Kullback-Leibler divergence values of the main analyses.
Below are attack rates and durations from seeding scenario the sensitivity analyses.

S12 Staff and Students Model
We added staff into the model, to understand whether or not they can affect how norovirus
is spread within venues.

S12.1

Students and Staff Model for Daycare and School

In the staff and student model, there is a staff age group and a student age group. To
derive the human-to-human transmission rates, we assume that the younger age group
(i.e., the students) transmit at higher rates than the older age group (i.e., the staff) due to
both contact rates [55] and susceptibility decreasing with age (e.g. represented by levels of
norovirus antibody titers [56]). Specifically, the human-to-human transmission matrix is
derived by taking the βHH from the students only model and setting that to the student to
student transmission rate. Next, we assume that the inter-age transmission rates (i.e., staff
to student and student to staff transmission are equal) and calculate that by multiplying
the student to student transmission rate by a randomly sampled reduction factor between
[0,1]. Finally, the staff-to-staff transmission rate is calculated by multiplying the inter-age
transmission rate by a randomly sampled reduction factor between [0,1] (this factor is also
used to derive the fomite-to-staff transmission rate).
Next, for fomite-to-human transmission there are two rates, one for students and one for
staff. The fomite-to-student transmission rate is calculated in the same way as the student
only model i.e., βHH multiplied by a randomly sampled parameter between [0, 2]. The
fomite-to-staff transmission rate is derived by multiplying the fomite-to-student rate by the
same factor used to derive the staff-to-staff transmission rate (mentioned above) between

[0,1]. Overall, the force of infection for the staff and students model is as follows:
λ(t)tot = (I + βA (A1 + A2 + A3 ))βHH
(8)

λ(t)1 = λ(t − 1)1 + (F1 + F2 )βW k
λ(t)2 = λ(t − 1)2 + (F1 + F2 )βW a

where λ(t)tot is the total force of infection (and is a vector representing the student force
of infection as the first element and the staff force of infection as the second element. Thus
the human-to-human transmission rate (βHH ) is a 2 by 2 matrix. λ(t)1 and λ(t)2 are added
to the force of infection for students and staff, respectively. Finally, βW k and βW a are the
fomite-to-human transmission rates for students and staff, respectively.
Finally, with respect to shedding, staff and students shed into a single shared environment.
Thus, the shedding and fomite tracking equations are as follows:

Shedding = αI I + αI βA (A1 e−σ( φ ) + A2 e−σ( φ + ρ ) + A3 e−σ( φ + ρ + ρ ) )
X
F˙1 =
Shedding − ξF1

(9)

F˙2 = ξF1 − ξF2
where the sum of shedding across both age groups is added to the F1 compartment because
there is a single environmental compartment in each venue.
For the immunity and combined models we assumed that staff had higher rates of partial
immunity than children [56].
All other model equations are the same as the student only model, we just vectorized
the equations to keep track of student and staff compartments separately. see Appendix
Section S4 for details.

S12.2

Students and Staff Model Likelihood Calculation

To derive an overall likelihood for a given venue, we took the NORS kernel density estimate values which corresponded to a given AR and population size for students from the
model and divided by the model kernel density estimate values which corresponded to a
given AR and population size for students from the model. We multiplied this by the corresponding staff value (i.e., NORS kernel density estimate divided by model kernel density
estimate), and finally, multiplied by the NORS kernel density estimate value divided by
the model kernel density estimate value which corresponded to a given outbreak duration
and total venue population from the model. More details can be found in Section 5.3. We
did not calculate a full 5-dimensional kernel density estimate due to computational limitations. Therefore, a key limitation in our approach for this sensitivity analysis is that we
are assuming independence between different kernel density estimates (e.g., the student
joint distribution of ARs and population size is assumed to be independent of the staff
distribution).
We calibrated the student and staff model to 137 daycare and 240 school outbreaks.

S12.3

Students and Staff Model Results

According to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the combined model calibrated best to the
NORS data. Although the median results were closer to NORS data for model scenarios,
the attack rate ranges were wider for the immunity model, and the outbreak duration
ranges were wider for the individual exclusion model.
