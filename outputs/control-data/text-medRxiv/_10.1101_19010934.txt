Abstract:
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a potentially lifethreatening infection endemic to Latin America that has emerged as a global public health issue
due to globalization and emigration patterns. Diagnosis of T. cruzi infection is complex,
especially for the chronic phase of the disease that is characterized by a low to moderate
burden of the difficult to detect, tissue-dwelling, intracellular form of the parasite. Diagnosis
relies on a multistep indirect serological detection approach that requires positive results in at
least two independent anti-T. cruzi antibody tests. With no gold standard diagnostic method for
chronic T. cruzi, new approaches are needed that can more directly test for the presence of the
parasite. Here, we report on of the potential utility of a noninvasive diagnostic approach that
specifically detects T. cruzi-derived cell-free repeat DNA in the urine of patients who are both
serologically positive and negative.

Introduction:
Chagas disease is a vector borne, neglected tropical infection endemic to Latin America. The
etiological agent of Chagas disease, the hemoflagellate Trypanosome cruzi, is maintained in the
environment by a zoonotic cycle that includes the triatomid vector and a variety of mammalian
species. Recently, Chagas disease has emerged as a global public health issue due to
globalization and the changing patterns of migration (1, 2); with approximately 8 million people
infected worldwide and at least 100 million at risk of infection (3). This complex disease involves
an acute and chronic phase that can cause heart and gastrointestinal issues depending on
disease progression. While Chagas disease was formally described by Carlos Chagas 110
years ago, there is still no single test for definitive diagnosis of the chronic form of T. cruzi
infection and the estimated index of under diagnosis remains ~95% (3).
In the acute phase (6-8 weeks post-infection), extracellular trypomastigotes are found in
the blood and, depending on the intensity of infection, can be readily detected through direct
microscopic visualization (3). Following the acute phase, around 70% of patients clear the
infection. The remaining patients transition into the chronic manifestation of the infection, which
can last 10-30 years (3) and where the non-circulating, difficult to detect intracellular amastigote
is the dominate form of the parasite. Diagnostics for chronic infection is based on a patchwork
of patient’s history, clinical findings and the results of multiple serological tests designed to
detect parasite antigen-specific IgG antibodies (4). Confirmatory diagnosis requires two different
serological tests, with a third test for confirmation when results are incongruous. When infection
is suspected, ECG’s, X-rays, endoscopy, and other tests are run to assess the presence of
Chagas disease-associated cardiomyopathy, megacolon, and megaesophagus (5). Importantly,
serological tests vary in sensitivity by geographical regions (6), further complicating diagnosis.

These factors result in a serious under-diagnosis of T. cruzi infections in both endemic and nonendemic areas.
Trypanomastid genomic DNA is complex with ~50% of the genome consisting of
repeated sequences (7). In addition to the nuclear genome, the kinetoplast genome, which
represents ~30% of the total DNA of the cell, is also highly repetitive with thousands of 1.4 kb
minicircles and dozens of ~25 Mb maxicircles (8). The repetitive nature of the genome provides
multiple targets for PCR-based-detection approaches. Two of these targets have been termed
satellite DNA (or Sat-DNA) and kinetoplast DNA (or K-DNA). The Sat-DNA designated TCZ is
composed of ~120,000 copies of a tandemly repeated 195 bp sequence of non-coding DNA
(23). TCZ represents ~10% of the parasites’ total DNA (9). The K-DNA minicircles each of
contain four regions of highly conserved sequence. The abundance of these repeats has made
them the focus of PCR-based approaches to detect the parasite DNA in blood and tissues (10).
The use of biomarkers in blood and other bodily fluids has gained wide use in the clinic.
Of note, the use of cell-free DNA is being applied as a biomarker for cancer, prenatal diagnosis
and in infectious diseases (11-13). While most methods use blood, cell-free DNA is also readily
detected in urine (13-16) and other biological fluids (17, 18). The detection of cell-free DNA has
been demonstrated to be of utility for the diagnosis of malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis,
schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, and filariasis (reviewed in (12)). In the blood, cell-free DNA is
degraded by endogenous nucleases (19) with a majority of the degradation products being
cleared by the liver and kidney (20). Further, it has been demonstrated that a proportion of the
cell-free DNA fragments identified in the circulation can pass through the glomerular barrier and
appear as 100-300 pb transrenal DNAs in the urine (14).
In the work presented here, we focused on determining the potential utility of detecting
parasite-derived transrenal DNAs by PCR to aid in the diagnosis of patients with chronic T. cruzi

infection. The results demonstrated that both T. cruzi Sat-DNA repeat and minicircle K-DNA
can be detected in the urine of both serology positive and serology negative patients and that
urine-based diagnosis has the potential to be a useful alternative approach to supplement
current diagnostic methods.

Materials and Methods:
Sample collection. A total of 36 urine and 34 blood samples were collected following informed
consent from patients participating in a study looking at the cardiac complications associated
with chronic Chagas disease directed by Dr. Robert Gilman (Department of International Health,
BSPH, JHU) and Dr. Rachel Marcus (MedStar Health & Vascular Institute, Washington, DC).
The study was part of a program to study the seroprevalence and characterization of Chagas
Disease cardiomyopathology among Latin Americans living in Fairfax County, VA. This was
approved by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health IRB No: 00006713 amended on
5.March 2018 to include this work. All participants fully understood the objective and
participated willingly. Participants provided ~45 mL of urine to which EDTA was added to 40 mM
(pH 8). The fresh urine was processed within 7 hours of collection by filtering through a filter
paper cone (12.5 cm Whatman No. 3), dried overnight, and stored individually with a desiccant
in plastic sleeves at 4°C. Urine samples obtained from ten individuals with no clinical history
and who were serologically negative were used as negative controls.
Serology. Serum samples were collected to assess the presence of anti-T. cruzi antibodies
using the following serological tests: Chagas Detect Plus (InBios, Seattle, WA), Hemagen
Chagas Kit (Hemagen Diagnostics, Inc. Columbia, MD), Chagatest EIA Recombinant V3.0
(Wiener Laboratorios S.A.I.C., Rosario, Argentina), BIOZIMA Chagas Kit (Polychaco, S.A.I.C.,
Buenos Aries, Argentina), and immunofluorescent detection for the presence of antiepimastigote antigens.
Isolation of transrenal DNAs. Ten 6.35 mm discs were punched from the inner quadrant of
the dried filter and place in a 1.5 ml tube. The discs were covered with 400 µL of nuclease-free
water, incubated at 95°C for 10 minutes, and then gently agitated overnight in a rotating water
bath at room temperature (~18 hours). After centrifuging at 4,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the

transrenal DNA was isolated using QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, MD) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentrations were measured using the Nano Drop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and samples were stored at 20°C.
PCR to detect T. cruzi transrenal DNAs. Three primer sets were employed to detect two
distinct T. cruzi repeat families. Two primer sets were used to detect K-DNA minicircle repeats.
Primers designated minicon-1 (M1) and minicon-2 (M2) (Figure 1) amplified a 113 bp product
from the T. cruzi K-DNA. The PCR reaction was prepared to a final volume of 15 µL containing
7.5 µL of PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.75 µL of each primer (10 µM),
2 µL of MgCl2 (25 mM), 2 µL of DNAs-free water and 2 μL of transrenal DNA template (1-3
ng/μL).
Primers 121-122 (Figure 1), targeting the K-DNA minicircle variable domain amplified a
330 bp product Shijman et al. (12). Amplification was performed at 15 µL final volume,
containing 7.5 µL of PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.75 µL of each
primer (10 µM), 0.75 µL of MgCl2 (25 mM), 3.25 µL of DNAs-free water, and 2 μL of transrenal
DNA template (1-3 ng/μL).
The third set of primers used a nested PCR (nPCR) approach based on Martins et al.
(21) employing primer sets TCZ1/TCZ2 and TCZ3/TCZ4 (Figure 1) in a two-step PCR that
produced a 149 bp product from the T. cruzi Sat-DNA repeats. For the first step amplification
was prepped for a total reaction volume of 15 µL containing 7.5 µL of PCR Master Mix (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.75 µL of each primer TCZ1/TCZ2 (10 µM), 1.5 µL of MgCl2 (25
mM), 2.5 µL of DNAs-free water, and 2 μL of transrenal DNA template (1-3 ng/μL). For the
second step, 7 µL of previous PCR product was used in a final volume of 20 µL, containing 7.5
µL of PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.75 µL of each primer TCZ3/TCZ4

(10 µM), 1.5 µL of MgCl2 (25 mM), and 2.5 µL of DNAs-free water. A summary of the primer
sequences and amplification conditions are outlined in Figure 1.
Each PCR run included a positive control composed of T. cruzi genomic DNA, five
negative urine controls and a water-only
control. Each sample was assayed in
duplicate and amplifications were conducted in
a SimpliAmpTM Thermal Cycler (Life
TechnologiesTM). The amplicons were initially
assessed by size on a 2% agarose gel. All
bands were extracted and confirmed by
sequencing as T. cruzi repeat DNA.

Results:
Urine samples were obtained from volunteers who originated in areas endemic for T. cruzi
but now reside in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. These volunteers visited the clinic for the
diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular conditions, some of which are associated with
chronic Chagas disease. Of the 36 volunteers who provided urine samples, 9 (25%) were male,
25 (69.4%) were female, and 2 (5.5%) did not respond. The overall mean age of the volunteers
was 42.1 (± SD 11.8). More than half of the participants (19; 52.8%) were between 40-59 years
old and 30.6% were between 18-39 years old. A majority of the participants originated from
either El Salvador (18, 50%) or Bolivia (11, 30.6%), with two from Argentina, two from
Guatemala, one from Costa Rica, and one from Peru (Table 1). One individual did not provide
their country of origin (NP, not provided). None of the volunteers who originated from T. cruziendemic regions showed overt signs of disease.
Approximately half of the volunteers (16/36) were considered positive for exposure to T.
cruzi by serology (Table 1). In order to be designated positive, a serum sample had to give a
positive result in at least two of the five antibody-based diagnostic assays (see Methods
section).
T. cruzi transrenal DNA was confirmed in 36% (13/36) of the urine samples. Of the 13
urine samples that were positive for T. cruzi transrenal DNA, four were obtained from individuals
who also tested positive for antibodies. There was no apparent pattern for detection of
transrenal DNA based on the country of origin or the sex of the volunteer.
The Minicon primers that targeted the K-DNA conserved domain amplified a 113 bp
fragment from nine samples. The nPCR approach targeting Sat-DNA amplified a 149 bp
fragment from seven samples. Primers 121-122 that targeted the K-DNA variable domain
amplified a 330 bp product from only a single sample. Of the 13 samples that tested positive for

approaches. Only one sample was positive for all three T. cruzi transrenal DNA amplicons.

Discussion:
Recently, interest has increased in using urine as a ‘liquid biopsy’ to diagnose and monitor
the efficacy of intervention strategies for viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens (22-24). While
some of these tests are designed to detect pathogen-derived proteins and glycoproteins, many
focus on the detection of pathogen-derived transrenal DNA. The advantages of transrenal DNAbased diagnosis of infectious diseases include (a) urine collection is non-invasive and abundant
(especially important for problematic patients such as neonates), (b) urine is easy and cheap to
collect and process (important for field work), (c) diagnosis does not depend on the stage of the
parasite or the site of infection, (d) the use of urine circumvents the multiple PCR inhibitors that are
present in the serum (25).
The recent introduction of PCR to detect T. cruzi cell-free DNA in blood specimens holds
promise as a sensitive and specific alternative to serology (26-28). While PCR assays from blood
are sensitive for diagnosis of acute infections, the blood-based assays are much less effective in
the context of chronic infections (10). A number of issues, including low levels and intermittent
release of T. cruzi cell-free DNA, could limit the utility of the blood-based PCR assays. The
feasibility to using parasite transrenal DNA in urine to detect T. cruzi infection was demonstrated by
Castro-Sequen and colleagues (29) who, in a guinea pig model, were able to PCR amplify parasite
kinetoplast and nuclear transrenal DNA. We have recently extended this to human urine samples.
To our knowledge, our results represent the first demonstration of parasite transrenal DNA from T.
cruzi-infected humans.
In the blood, cell-free DNA is degraded by endogenous nucleases (19) with a majority of the
degradation products being cleared by the liver and kidney (20). Further, it has been demonstrated
that cell-free DNA fragments identified in the circulation can pass through the glomerular barrier and
appear as transrenal DNA in the urine (14). Reports have shown that transrenal DNAs represent

fragments that range between 150–300 bp (30). This small size range needs to be taken into
consideration in the design of detection assays. Indeed, in the work presented here, only the
Minicon primers that amplified a 113 bp product from the minicircle K-DNA was sensitive in our
assay. In contrast, the 121-122 primers, that amplifies a 330 bp amplicon, was significantly less
sensitive for the detection of transrenal fragments of minicircle K-DNA with only one sample giving
a positive result.
To address the fact that T. cruzi persists at low-levels in the tissues as amastigotes and only
intermittently in the blood during chronic infection, a number of indirect serological methods have
been developed to identify infected individuals. The current WHO-recommended standard for
serological detection of T. cruzi infection is the use of “two conventional tests based on different
principles and detecting different antigens” (31). These most widely used versions of these tests, a
number of which were used in this study, measure anti-T. cruzi IgG by ELISA, IFA, RIA, Western
Blots, and other methods (3, 32). While these tests are reported to have sensitivity and specificity
levels between 90-98%, a recent analysis concluded that the serological tests “appear less
accurate than previously thought” and that caution should be exercised when using these tests for
the identification of individuals with chronic infection (32, 33). Although multiple issues contribute to
the uncertainty in the interpretation of anti-T. cruzi serology results, the lack of a ‘gold standard’
method or set of reference reagents that can be used to calibrate the various assays and the
inability to determine if the antibodies represent on-going or past exposure to the parasite limit the
diagnostic utility of these tests.
In the results presented here only 30% of the samples that tested positive for one or more of
the T. cruzi transrenal repeat sequences were derived from individuals who also meet the criteria to
be designated positive by serology. Since the detection of parasite-derived DNA is a direct
measure of the ongoing infection, this indicates that, in the context of chronic infection, serology
might be seriously underestimating the levels of infection.

Conversely, 12/16 volunteers who tested positive by serology provided urine samples that
were negative for transrenal DNAs from both of the parasite repeats. The presence of anti-T. cruzi
antibodies in the serum of these individuals could reflect previous exposure(s) to the parasite that
were subsequently cleared thus accounting for the lack of parasite-derived transrenal DNAs. It is
also possible that at least some of these seropositive volunteers are chronically infected and have
T. cruzi transrenal DNA in their urine but the parasite-derived repeat DNA that is too low to detect
under the conditions employed here. Alternatively, the parasite-derived transrenal DNA might
originate from other areas of the parasite’s genome so that the primers used here would miss these
patients. Studies designed to identify additional common parasite-derived transrenal DNAs would
be important for the development of multiplex approach that could enhance the utility of using urinebased analysis as a main-line tool for the clinical and epidemiological monitoring of chronic T. cruzi
infections.
While further studies with a larger population are needed for improved primer
development, the detection of T. cruzi DNA in urine has the potential to provide a novel noninvasive and direct diagnostic method for Chagas disease that can be employed to improve
chronic phase detection, treatment-monitoring, early detection in congenital disease cases and
the management of immunosuppressed patient.
