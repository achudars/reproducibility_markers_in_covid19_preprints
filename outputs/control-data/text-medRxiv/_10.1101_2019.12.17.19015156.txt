Running head: Evaluation of colistin diagnostics on Gram-negative bacteria.

Highlights
The diagnostic efficiencies, cost, required skill and ease-of-use of colistinresistance diagnostics were evaluated against the broth microdilution
The ComASPTM was most sensitive, less skill-requiring and cheap
The CHROMagar COL-APSE was easiest to perform, albeit expensive and less
sensitive
The MicroScan was most expensive, requires advanced skills and was very
sensitive, particularly for Enterobacteriaceae without E. cloacae and Salmonella.
The Colistin MAC test is a better PCR alternative for detecting mcr producers in
low-resource settings

Abstract
Background: Colistin has become a critical antibiotic for fatal Gram-negative infections
owing to the proliferation of multidrug-resistant carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Thus,
cheaper, faster, efficient and easier-to-use colistin diagnostics are required for clinical
surveillance, diagnoses and therapeutics.
Methods: The sensitivity, specificity, major error (ME), very major error (VME), categorial
agreement, essential agreement, turnaround time (TAT), average cost, and required skill for
four colistin resistance diagnostics viz., CHROMagar COL-APSE, ComASP™Colistin,
MicroScan®, and Colistin MAC Test (CMT) were evaluated against broth microdilution
(BMD) using 84 Gram-negative bacterial isolates. A multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used to
screen all isolates to detect the presence of the mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes. A 15-point grading
scale was used to grade the tests under skill, ease, processing time etc.
Results: mcr-1 was detected by both M-PCR and CMT in a single E. coli isolate. The
sensitivity and specificity of CHROMagar COL-APSE, MicroScan®, and
ComASP™Colistin, were 82.05% and 66.67%, 92.31% and 76.92%, and 100% and 88.89%
respectively. The MicroScan® was the most expensive at a cost (per sampe tested) of R221.6
($15.0), followed by CHROMagar COL-APSE (R118.3; $8.0), M-PCR (R75.1; $5.1), CMT
(R20.1; $1.4) and ComASP™Colistin (R2.64; $0.2). CHROMagar was the easiest to
perform, followed by ComASP™Colistin, M-PCR, MicroScan®, CMT and BMD whilst MPCR and MicroScan required higher skill.
Conclusions: The ComASP™Colistin was the best performing diagnostic test, with low
VME and ME, making it recommendable for routine colistin sensitivity testing in clinical
laboratories; particularly, in poorer settings. It is however limited by a TAT of 18-24 hours.

Introduction
Subsequent to the exponential dissemination of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in
Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and the increased use of carbapenems to treat infections
unresponsive to the penicillins and cephems (cephalosporins and cephamycins),
carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-resistant GNB are becoming common worlwide
1,2

. Thus, carbapenems, which are last-resort antibiotics, are being replaced by colistin, a

polymyxin that was discovered many years ago but shelved over nephrotoxicity and
neurotoxicity concerns 2,3. Resistance to colistin, due to its increased use to treat carbapenemresistant GNB, has also emerged 2–4. Beginning from 2016, colistin resistance, which hithero
was mediated my chromosomal mutations, was found to be also mediated by plasmid-borne
mcr genes 5,6. The high fatalities caused by colistin and/or carbapenem-resistant GNB
infections have led to their being categorised as high-priority pathogens by the WHO 7,8. The
clinical importance of colistin-resistant GNB (CR-GNB) necessitates an efficient diagnostic
protocol for quickly and efficiently detecting them to pre-empt further escalation and
mortalities 9.
Several diagnostic assays have been developed to detect CR-GNB, although the CLSI and
EUCAST recommend the broth microdilution (BMD) as the standard test for confirming
colistin sensitivity 9. To date, settling on an efficient, fast, cheaper and easy-to-use diagnostic
for detecting colistin resistance in routine remains a challenge, particularly in developing
countries 9–11. This is inspite of the fact that several colistin-resistance diagnostics exist,
broadly categorised under phenotypic and molecular tests 9. The phenotypic tests include the
culture-based screening media such as CHROMagar COL-APSE, LBJMR, Superpolymyxin

etc., MIC (minimum-inhibitory concentration)-determiners such as BMD, E-test, Sensititre
(now CHROMagar-COL-APSE), MicroScan®, BD-Phoenix®, UMIC, Micronaut-S, and
Vitek®, chelator-based assays etc. 9
We are still behind in the race against antimicrobial resistance and current diagnostics still
have a lot of optimisation and evaluation to be done. This is particularly so due to the everevolving nature of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Owing to the dearth of evaluation
studies comparing assays from screening media, MIC-determiners, chelator-based tests, and
molecular assays as well as the absence of studies describing the cost and skill component of
these tests, this study was undertaken 9. Due to logistical and reagent availability restrictions
and delays, we were only able to compare the following tests selected from the various
subsets of colistin diagnostics: CHROMagar COL-APSE (screening media), MicroScan®
Walkaway system (automated MIC-determiner), ComASP™Colistin (manual MICdeterminer; formerly Sensititre), colistin-MAC test (chelator-based test) and multiplex PCR
(molecular assay). By including a cost and required-skill component, we aim to provide data
for informing colistin resistance diagnostic choices for under-resourced laboratories.
Methods
Bacterial sampling and colistin sensitivity testing
A total of 84 clinical GNB isolates were used for this study. The isolates were obtained from
the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS), Pretoria, and Ampath laboratories
(Johannesburg) with already de-identified patient data. The species of the isolates were
determined using the MicroScan® Walkaway ID panels (Beckman Coulter, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The isolates were screened with BMD using recommended CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute) guidelines 12 to identify isolates that were resistant and susceptible to

colistin. The EUCAST breakpoints were used to interpret the results due to an absence of
CLSI breakpoint for colistin 9,13. Genomic DNA was isolated from overnight cultures of the
isolates using the Zymo Research Quick-DNA™ miniprep Kit (USA) according to the
manufacturer`s instructions. A multiplex PCR (M-PCR) assay was used to determine the
presence or absence of mobile colistin resistance genes, mcr-1 to mcr-5, using already
described protocols and primers (Table 1) 9,14. Primers were procured from Inqaba
biotechnologies (Pretoria, South Africa).
Identifying colistin-resistant isolates with CHROMagar™ COL-APSE, MicroScan®
Walkaway system, ComASP™ Colistin and Colistin MAC Test (CMT)
Fresh 24-hour cultures of the isolates, grown on blood agar (Oxoid, UK), were plated unto
already prepared CHROMagar™ COL-APSE media (Chromagar, Paris, France) using
manufacturer’s instructions. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C under aerobic
conditions overnight and the results were observed by observing different coloured colonies,
using the manufacturer`s interpretation criteria for identifying CR-GNB. The media’s ability
to identify and correctly differentiate CR-GNB species within mixed cultures was assessed
and compared to the MicroScan® Walkaway system’s species identification.
For the MicroScan analyses, a single colony from the overnight cultures on the blood agar
was standardized promptly using the prompt inoculation system provided in the reagent
packaging for MicroScan AST (antimicrobial sensitivity testing) and identification (ID)
testing. After inoculation, the solution was transferred into the N66 panels and loaded into the
instrument for overnight processing. Species identification was obtained and colistin
sensitivity results were interpreted according EUCAST breakpoints.
ComASP™ COL(colistin) consists of a compact panel of four tests containing seven two-fold
dilutions of dehydrated COL. In this study, a 0.5 McFarland suspension of the isolates was

prepared in a solution of 250mL saline and then diluted to 1:20 in saline (Gibco, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) to obtain the first solution (Solution A). Solution A
(0.4mL) was added to a Mueller-Hinton broth (3.6mL) tube to obtain solution B. One
hundred microliters of solution B was dispensed into each well and the panels were incubated
(Vacutec, US) at 36±2°C for 16 to 20 hours in ambient air. Results were analysed visually
using a bright indirect light against a dark background.
The CMT was carried out as described in a study by Coppi et al. (2018)15. The colistin
sulphate concentrations tested ranged from 0.125 to 64µg/mL alone or in combination with
DPA (dipicolinic acid) at a fixed concentration of 900 µg/mL. The DPA stock solution was
prepared in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 100mg/mL and stored at 20°C. Cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth was used as the medium for susceptibility
testing alongside DPA and DMSO at a fixed concentration of 900 µg/mL and increasing
colistin concentrations (0.125-64µg/mL). Wells 11 and 12 were used for growth control
whilst well 11 was not inoculated; well 12 was inoculated with the test isolate. Susceptibility
testing was carried out in 96-well microtitre trays with results recorded after 20 hours of
incubation at 35 ± 2°C. Susceptibility to colistin was interpreted using the EUCAST
guidelines. The results were considered as mcr-1 positive (a ≥8-fold reduction) or mcr-1
negative (a ≤2-fold reduction) in the presence of DPA.
Data and statistical analysis
The results of the various tests were curated in Microsoft Excel and categorised into
susceptible and resistant isolates using the BMD results. Using the BMD as the gold standard,
the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV
respectively), categorical agreement (CA), essential agreement (EA), major errors (ME) and
very major errors (VME) of each test were calculated using the equations 1-8 below.

Cost and skill (ease of application) analyses
The cost per sample for each of the tests were calculated by dividing the total cost of
reagents, including VAT, by the number of samples that were tested by those reagents.
Equipment costs, specifically the MicroScan Walkaway system and the thermocycler used for
the M-PCR, were not included. The costs were calculated in Rands and converted to US
dollars using current exchange rates (12-13/12/2019).
We assessed the required skill and ease of using the various tests by grading the various tests
against five parameters: (1) time in hours needed to perform each test; (2) ease in carrying out
test; (3) skill or training required (4) requirement for 3rd-party equipment and infrastructure

and (5) cost and access to 3rd-party equipment and infrastructure. The breakdown of the
assigned grades, on a scale of 5 to 15 for these five parameters, are shown in Table 2.
Results
The BMD identified 44 isolates as resistant to colistin and 40 as susceptible (Table 3). Only
one isolate, an E. coli, was found to harbour the mcr-1 gene per the PCR results (Table 3; Fig.
1). The isolates were identified by the MicroScan® Walkaway to comprise of 12 species viz.,
Enterobacter cloacae (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=12), Salmonella enterica (n=12),
Acinetobacter baumannii (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=9), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=4),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=4), Proteus mirabilis (n=2), Burkholderia cepacia (n=1),
Hafnia alvei (n=1), Providencia stuartii (n=1), and Tatumella spp. (n=1) (Figure 2A).
CHROMagar COL-APSE supported the growth of 46 (55%) isolates, which were identified
as COL-R (colistin-resistant) isolates with substantial false positives and false negatives
(Table 1; Figure 2B & 2C). The cultured isolates resulted in colony growth and identification
of 22 isolates (26%) as COL-R coliforms, 15 isolates (18%) as COL-R Acinetobacter spp,
three isolates (4%) as COL-R Pseudomonas spp, and six isolates (7%) as E. coli. A total of
38 isolates (45%) were not identified as COL-R by CHROMagar COL-APSE, most of which
were susceptible (Table 3). It is interesting to note that although this media suppresses the
growth of susceptible strains, some grew on it, resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of
82.05% and 66.67% respectively. As well, the species prediction of CHROMagar COL-APSE
mostly mirrored that of the MicroScan with some few disagreements (Table 3). The
CHROMagar COL-APSE was thus the least sensitive and least specific among all the tests
(Table 4; Figure 3).
However, the ComASP™ had an overall sensitivity of 87.18% and specificity of 73.33%,
which respectively increases to 100% and 88.89%. when only K. pneumoniae and E. coli

results are used (Table 4). The evaluable essential agreement was calculated by evaluating
ComASP™ results (≤ 0.25 µg/mL or  16 µg/mL) with BMD results (≤ 0.5µg/mL or≥ 16
µg/mL). The overall evaluable EA was 53%, but with the focus on K. pneumoniae and E. coli
only, the evaluable EA was 66.67%. A PPV and NPV of 73.91% and 86.84% were recorded
respectively, with a VME of 12.82% and a ME of 26.67%. ComASP™ had an EA of
78.57%. Compared to what has been done in previous works, where the focus was only on K.
pneumoniae and E. coli 9, the ComASP™ performs better with a sensitivity of 100% and
specificity of 88.89%, including a PPV of 92.31% and NPV of 100% (Table 4; Figure 3).
Thus, the ComASP overall results (A, see Figure 3) proved quite more sensitive but less
specific than the MicroScan system, which had an overall sensitivity and specificity of
85.71% and 76.19%. When E. cloacae, Salmonella and non-fermenting Gram-negatives
except Pseudomonas spp. are excluded from the MicroScan results, its sensitivity, but not
specificity, increased substantially to 92.31% (Table 4). The CMT was able to identify the
only mcr-1 positive isolate and the 83 non-mcr-positive isolates, resulting in a sensitivity and
specificity of 100% (Table 4).
In terms of cost per sample, the MicroScan® was the most expensive at a cost of R221.6
($15.0), followed by CHROMagar COL-APSE (R118.3; $8.0), M-PCR (R75.1; $5.1), CMT
(R20.1; $1.4) and ComASP™Colistin (R2.64; $0.2). With regards to time and ease of
application, the CHROMagar was the easiest to perform, followed by ComASP™Colistin,
M-PCR, MicroScan®, CMT and BMD. However, the MicroScan and PCR required 3rd-party
equipment and advanced skill that could be a challenge for lower income countries or underresourced laboratories. With the exception of M-PCR, all the tests had a TAT (turnaround
time) of 18-24 hours (Table 5).

The importance of colistin in the treatment of fatal infections caused by carbapenem-resistant
GNB makes the search for an efficient colistin diagnostic an essential and life-saving
exercise. However, finding a diagnostic tool that can be easily adapted into the workflow of
routine microbiology laboratories remains a challenge as the recommended colistin
sensitivity testing method, the BMD, is labour intensive 9. Moreover, disc diffusion and Etest, which are simpler to perform, are fraught with inherent errors due to difficulty in colistin
diffusion through agar 9. Several rapid and non-rapid assays have been designed and
proposed to help detect colistin directly from clinical samples or from culture, yet challenges
still exist in terms of diagnostic performance, TAT, required skill, sample-processing cost etc.
9

In this study, selected culture-based diagnostics were evaluated to determine their relative

diagnostic efficiencies viz., sensitivities, specificities, NPV, PPV, ME, VME, EA and CA,
required skill, ease of application, requirement for 3rd-party equipment/infrastructure and
sample-processing cost to advise clinical and diagnostic laboratories, particularly in resourceconstrained settings.
ComASP™ Colistin is a BMD-based method used to determine colistin MICs (Carreto et al.,
2018)16. The 96-well BMD method is a very labour-intensive technique that requires a highly
skilled professional, all plates and antibiotic concentrations must be manually prepared, and it
is very time-consuming (Table 5) 9. In this study, ComASP™ was able to successfully give
colistin MICs for all tested isolates, with an essential agreement of 78.57%. The assay
recorded a CA of 79.76% and a VME of 12.82% (lowest out of all the evaluated tests) and a
ME of 26.67%. The VME and ME are high and unacceptable, but this can be explained by
the fact that this assay was challenged with Gram-negative bacteria, which include the nonfermenters, compared to other studies where the assay was only used to investigate colistin
MICs for E. coli and K. pneumoniae (Table 6) 17.

Thus, upon excluding results from the non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria and using only
K. pneumoniae and E. coli as done in previous works 16,18, the ComASP™ performed way
better, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 88.89% respectively. A PPV and NPV
of 92.31% and 100% were respectively recorded whilst a CA, EA and ME of 95.24%,
66.67% and 8.83% were also respectively obtained; no VMEs were observed (Table 6). The
EA could only be calculated by evaluating ComASP™ results (≤ 0.25 µg/mL or  16
µg/mL) with BMD results (≤ 0.5µg/mL or≥ 16 µg/mL), given the differences between the
colistin concentrations between the ComASP™ and the BMD. Thus, ComASPTM is best
suited for detecting COL-R K. pneumoniae and E coli isolates as observed in a previous study
by Matuschek and coworkers (2018) who concluded that the ComASP™ can reliably identify
most COL-R K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates 18. ComASP™ Colistin is easy to perform
and interpret the results. It is not too costly and can be easily used in resource poor
laboratories.
Overall, the ComASPTM (formerly Sensititre) performed better than the other diagnostics,
followed closely by the MicroScan (Figure 3). Notably, these two high-performing tests
recorded higher diagnostic performances when certain species that lowered the tests’
sensitivities were excluded, suggesting that not all species can be efficiently analysed with
these two tests. Specifically, the MicroScan also increased in sensitivity after excluding E.
cloacae, Salmonella and Gram-negative non-fermenters except Pseudomonas spp. Therefore,
results on species that performed poorly on these tests should be further verified with other
tests that are efficient in detecting colistin resistance in those species to avoid making fatal
diagnostic or therapeutic decisions. For instance, laboratories that are already using the
MicroScan can augment it with the ComASP. In terms of cost, ease of application and
required skill, the ComASPTM further had an advantage over the MicroScan, although it

should be noted that the MicroScan can determine the AST of several antibiotics whilst the
ComASP is only designed for colistin 9.
The MicroScan system is laborious due to the daily maintenance of the instrument required
and barcoding of the panels. The system is very costly as there are no panels available for
only colistin AST. The system also requires highly skilled or trained personnel to operate it
(Tables 2 & 5). It is important to take note of factors stated by Jayol and co-workers (2018)19
that the MicroScan® system`s procedural manual indicates that results for E. cloacae,
Salmonella and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, except Pseudomonas spp., must not
be reported. The latter is a major challenge and, in this study, all results for our E. cloacae,
Salmonella and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria did not give MIC values as they
returned as “Non-readable result” (Table 3). Hence, we only regarded the MicroScan`s results
without the E. cloacae, Salmonella and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria except
Pseudomonas as suitable to evaluate with the other tests. Consequently, the MicroScan was
able to detect 92.31% of the isolates that were resistant to colistin by the gold standard. The
MicroScan had a low specificity of 76.92% after the ComASP™ Colistin’s 88.89 (B; see
Figure 3). This is further supported by a study in South Africa by Mohlabeng and colleagues
(2017), where the MicroScan`s efficacy in reporting Carbapenemase-Producing
Enterobacteriaceae was investigated and it was concluded that the MicroScan® Walkaway
system is sensitive but lacks specificity 20. One isolate was falsely detected as susceptible,
explaining the 7.69% VME rate.
CHROMagar COL-APSE is a selective culture media used to isolate and differentiate
colistin-resistant Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas and Enterobacteriaceae
species with intrinsic, acquired or novel mechanisms of COL-resistance 21. CHROMagar
successfully isolated and differentiated 46 colistin-resistant isolates, with majority being
coliforms, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp (Figure 2B-C). Interestingly, 7% of the

colistin-resistant isolates were identified to the species level as E. coli, including the mcr-1
positive E. coli isolate, which further supports CHROMagar COL-APSE`s ability to recover
colistin-resistant isolates with acquired colistin resistance as stated by the developers of the
medium 21. In this study, the CHROMagar had the highest VME and ME, which should be
investigated further.
In a previous study, a 100% specificity and sensitivity was recorded for CHROMagar 21
whilst we recorded a specificity of 66.67% and a sensitivity of 82.05%. This discrepancy
could be due to the other study’s use of serial dilutions in broth whilst we evaluated the
performance of the media using cultured bacteria; this might be a limitation in our study that
can be further investigated. A recent study by Thiry et al. (2019) evaluated CHROMagar
COL-APSE against CHROMID® Colistin_R and agar disk diffusion and concluded that
growth on the media corelates with resistant results on the disk diffusion and not with the
presence of the mcr genes 10. Our study supports this as growth on the CHROMagar in this
study was observed for most isolates that did have any mcr genes in the PCR assay; however,
this study had only one mcr-positve isolate, limiting a comprehensive comparison and
conclusion. Nevertheless, these findings indicate that the mechanism of resistance does not
limit the ability of CHROMagar to isolate and differentiate colistin-resistant organisms.
CHROMagar COL-APSE plates are easy to prepare and interpret the results. Moreover,
following the manufacturer`s instructions is easy, and the technique does not require a skilled
individual (Tables 2 & 5). The medium is cost effective and only requires overnight
incubation until results can be obtained.
The PCR assay detected several bands, majority of which were not specific to any of the
described mcr genes (Figure 1), indicating that the mechanisms of resistance in these isolates
are either intrinsic or novel. However, a single E. coli isolate (D1b) was found to be mcr-1
positive by the multiplex PCR as shown in Figure 1. The latter is not surprising as previous

works in South Africa has shown the mcr-1 gene to be dominant in the country and has been
isolated in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town from E. coli isolates 22. Isolates D3 and
B1 showed non-specific bands around the mcr-3 and mcr-4 genes respectively, but it is
unlikely for these isolates to be positive for these genes as mcr-3 and mcr-4 have not been
reported in South Africa. The multiplex PCR is highly sensitive and specific, but it could be
confirmed through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to ascertain the presence or absence of
other mcr-genes and alleles. The PCR is expensive, quite time-consuming and requires a
highly skilled individual to perform and analyse the results (Tables 2 & 5).
The CMT is a DPA chelator-based tool used to detect the presence of mcr genes 9. In our
study, no ≥8 fold-increases in MICs were observed for all the mcr-negative isolates,
consistent with a study by Coppi and colleagues (2018) where their colistin MICs neither
changed nor increased or were at most reduced by two folds for 13 mcr-negative colistinresistant strains. Our mcr-1 positive E. coli isolate had an 8-fold MIC reduction, similar to
that reported by Coppi et al. (2018) wherein their 59 mcr-1-positive E. coli strains had a ≥ 8fold reduction in colistin MICs in the presence of DPA. Unlike the other tests, the CMT assay
cannot detect colistin-resistant isolates that are mcr-negative and can be a major limitation in
settings where mcr genes are absent. Thus, coupled with its laborious and time-consuming
nature, it might be difficult for the CMT to be adopted in clinical microbiology laboratories.
However, where access to PCR is a challenge or novel mcr variants are being sought, it can
be a cheaper, albeit time-consuming, alternative.
The presence of only a single mcr-1-positve isolate is a major limitation for this study as a
single isolate cannot be used to make strong conclusions based on statistical inference. As
well, we could not include other rapid screening and biochemical tests such as the
SuperPolymyxin, LBJMR, the rapid Polymyxin NP test (RPNP) and commercial RPNP tests
9

due to logistical challenges.

Conclusion
In this study, the ComASP™ was found to be the best-performing MIC determiner because it
had the highest sensitivity and specificity with minimal errors but were more costly than the
BMD. It is easy to use and can be employed in diagnostic laboratories that seek to conduct
colistin susceptibility screening. The assay can be easily used in less-resourced laboratories
without the need of a skilled personnel; the only requirement is an appropriate incubator. The
MicroScan® walkaway system is a very expensive tool that demands highly skilled personnel
and is time-consuming. The MicroScan® walkaway system was the second-best diagnostic
with regards to its sensitivity and had the second lowest VMEs and lowest MEs, albeit it was
the most expensive. It is also not ideal for colistin AST of non-fermenting Gram-negative
bacteria and the BMD must be used to confirm the MicroScan`s colistin AST results for nonfermenters.
CHROMagar COL-APSE is costly than the gold standard but can be used in any routine
laboratory that has an incubator. However, its diagnostic performance was relatively poor,
making it unsuitable for routine use in a diagnostic laboratory. The multiplex PCR is a
sensitive and specific tool for detecting plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mcr genes, albeit
it is expensive (fourth most expensive in this study), requires high skill and cannot be used to
guide decisions on therapy. It is however ideal for surveillance in diagnostic laboratories
without WGS capabilities for confirming the presence or absence of mcr genes in colistinresistant isolates. The CMT is cost effective for detecting mcr-positive isolates, including
novel alleles, in a setting without molecular assays such as the multiplex PCR or WGS;
however, more work is needed to challenge this technique with different mcr positive strains.
Further studies must look at WGS and its performance in rapidly detecting mcr-harbouring
strains of Gram-negative bacteria that are colistin-resistant23

EA: essential agreement, CA: categorical agreement, MEs: major error, VME: very major error. Table 6 above
indicates ComASP™ results from other studies compared to results in this study. In this study, the CA, MEs and
VMEs for ComASP™ Colistin were consistent with other studies but recorded the lowest EA.

Figure 1: Gel electrophoresis run of mcr-1 to mcr-5 amplicons for all 84 samples. Image (A)
contains results for 18 isolates, (B) contains results for 16 isolates, and (C) and (D) contains
19 isolates each. On the sides are the ladders (L) and controls. The mcr-1-positive isolate,
D1b, is shown in (B).

ambient air: (i) colistin-resistant E. coli are dark-pink to reddish, (ii) colistin-resistant
coliforms are metallic blue, (iii) colistin-resistant Pseudomonas are translucent, +/- natural
pigmentation cream to green, (iv) colistin-resistant Acinetobacter are cream(ish) and (v) other
Gram-negative colistin-resistant species are colourless.
