Background: We investigated whether stroke volume reserve (STVR) would predict 1year mortality and need for advanced therapies in heart-failure with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) patients.
Methods and Results:
We retrospectively studied 104 ambulatory patients with HFrEF (59.2+10.2 years, 89%
male) referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). At 1 year, 39 outcomes were
observed: 16 heart-transplants (HTx), 8 left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), and 15
deaths. Stroke volume (SV) was determined by the Fick principle with established values
for C[a-v]O2 at rest and anaerobic threshold (AT). STVR was calculated by SV AT/SVrest.
Multi-predictor regression showed a correlation of STVR<1.3 (OR 7.92, p=0.002), cardiac
index by right heart catheterization<2 (OR 3.07, p=0.049), and peak VO2 below the 2016
ISHLT cut-off (OR 4.09, p=0.011). HFrEF patients with a low peak VO2 and STVR>1.3
showed similar survival compared to patients with a peak VO 2 above the ISHLT cut-off.
A scoring system was developed: STVR<1.3—2 points, peak VO2 below the ISHLT cutoff—1 point, and cardiac index<2—1 point. A score of >3 demonstrated a sensitivity of
67% and specificity of 79% for 1-year events.
Conclusions: STVR is a novel parameter that may better predict 1-year outcomes than
peak VO2 in HFrEF patients.

Introduction
The morbidity and mortality of HFrEF patients have improved considerably over
the years since the first major heart-failure trial, the Veterans Administration Heart Failure
Trial (V-HeFT-I), was published (1-3). However, despite advancements in modern
medical therapy, there remain patients who continue to progress in their heart-failure
course and prompt evaluation for advanced heart-failure therapies (4). These patients are
considered to be in advanced or ACC/AHA Stage D heart-failure (5). Significant limitation
in exercise tolerance, typically using a threshold of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) < 1214 ml/kg/min, is a commonly cited indicator for advanced therapies by the ISHLT (6, 7).
The use of a specific peak exercise VO2 level however has several limitations
because it can be influenced by multiple other factors including muscle deconditioning,
age, gender, obesity, and anemia (8-10). Though ideally VO2 would correlate highly with
cardiac output (CO), it is fundamentally limited by the fact that it cannot account for the
change in arteriovenous difference in oxygen content (C[a-v]O2) during exercise (11). The
relationship is described by the Fick principle: peak VO 2 = peak CO x peak C[a-v]O2. As
a result, invasive assessments of hemodynamic response showed additional prognostic
value because they provide accurate measurements of peak CO (12, 13). However,
invasively derived hemodynamic measurements during exercise are difficult to perform
routinely and noninvasive measurements of CO are also technically complicated and lack
accuracy (8, 14, 15). Thus neither methods have gained widespread acceptance.
Stringer and his colleagues previously described the relationship with SV and
exercise, also recently confirmed by Gmada and coauthors (11, 16). The authors show
that SV increases during the initial and intermediate phases of exercise and peaks at AT.

Any further increase in CO is dependent on increase in heart rate. Given this consistent
relationship between VO2 and CO up to AT, we are able to accurately estimate the
increase in SV at AT non-invasively.
In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of SV at AT divided by SV
at rest, defined as STVR, in HFrEF patients compared to the usual measures of CPET,
i.e., peak VO2, VO2 at AT (AT VO2), and minute ventilation divided by carbon dioxide
output (VE/VCO2). To date, no study utilizing STVR for risk stratification in HFrEF patients
have been performed. We hypothesized that STVR would better predict mortality, LVAD
implantation, or HTx in HFrEF patients.

Methods
Study Population and Design
We retrospectively analyzed 104 HFrEF patients who underwent CPET at the
University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), physiology laboratory for advanced
therapies evaluation consecutively between January 2017 and September 2018. Patients
with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35% by echocardiography and New York
Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV were included. Patients less than 18 years old,
with

disease,

transplantation, requiring intravenous inotropic therapy or failing to reach AT were
excluded.

Incremental symptom-limited CPET was performed using a V-max metabolic cart
(CareFusion, San Diego, CA). A technician selected an appropriate step-wise treadmill
exercise protocol based on the patient’s weight and expected work expenditure (50, 100,
or 150 Watts). All patients performed exercise testing on a treadmill. The treadmill
protocols had been clinically validated within each weight interval to produce a uniform
increase in mechanical work and metabolic energy expenditure per incremental step.
Each patient performed a maximum voluntary ventilation maneuver prior to exercise. A
calibrated ptcCO2 sensor was placed in the subclavicular skin or ear lobe position,
depending on patient preference. Exhaled gases, electrocardiography and pulse oximetry
were measured continuously. After a 2-3-minute period of standing at rest, each patient
exercised with one-minute incremental increases in workload until the point of exhaustion.
Minute ventilation (VE), VO2, carbon dioxide output (VCO2), and other cardiopulmonary
variables were acquired on a breath-by-breath basis and averaged over 30-second
intervals. Within each increment, the ptcCO2 reading at 30 seconds was accepted as an
estimate of the paCO2 for the entire increment. The ventilatory AT was detected by the Vslope method (17).
SV at rest and at AT
SV during rest and at AT were reflected noninvasively by the equation: SV = (VO 2
/ heart rate) / C[a-v]O2. The C[a-v]O2 was estimated to be 6.1 ml O2 / 100 ml blood at rest
and 11.3 ml O2 / 100 ml blood at AT. The estimates of C[a-v]O2 at rest and at AT reflect
the values consistently measured by arterial and pulmonary artery blood sampling in
healthy subjects and in patients at various stages of heart failure (18-21). They also
approximate the C[a-v]O2 we have measured at rest and at AT in patients with pulmonary

hypertension who underwent exercise testing in our center’s catheterization laboratory
with pulmonary artery and arterial catheters in place (unpublished communication).
Previous invasive experiments on healthy subjects demonstrated an increase in the
stroke volume by approximately 40% at AT when compared to rest (22-25).
Outcomes and Data Acquisition
The primary outcome was a composite of death, HTx or LVAD implantation 1 year
after performance of CPET. Outcomes determined by chart review and patient follow up
via phone calls for patients that were not seen in the hospital system within the past 3
months. All of the authors have full access to the data in the study and take full
responsibility for its integrity and the analysis. All aspects of this study were approved by
the UC San Diego Human Research Protections Program.
Right heart catheterization data was obtained within 30 days of CPET for 82 of the
104 patients. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated as: PVR (Wood units)
= [mean pulmonary artery pressure (PA) - pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)
/ CO. Transpulmonary gradient (TPG) was calculated as: TPG (mmHg) = mean PA PCWP. The RV stroke work index (RVSWI) was calculated as (mean PA - mean RA) x
SV index x 0.0136 (g-m2/beat). All other clinical data was obtained at the time of CPET.
Statistical Analysis
The predictors of 1-year composite outcome were identified using single- and
multi-predictor logistic regression. Multi-predictor logistic regression used backwards
model selection, starting with the covariates significant at p<0.05 in single-predictor
models, and with a p<0.05 threshold for inclusion. As an additional step, the predictors

from the final multi-predictor model were dichotomized using defined cut-offs. The cut-off
values for STVR and cardiac index were chosen to minimize the Euclidian distance from
the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve to the upper-left corner of the ROC
graph, in effect maximizing a combination of sensitivity and specificity (26, 27). For the
other parameters in our model, including peak VO2, Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS)
score, and Kato model score, previous studies and the 2016 ISHLT guidelines for hearttransplant listing (7, 28) were used for selection of the cut-off values. Based on the final
multi-predictor logistic regression model, which included the dichotomized STVR, peak
VO2, and cardiac index, we created a “STVR risk score”, which uses simple integer
weights for each of the three covariates, based on their model coefficient (i.e., log odds
ratio), with the lowest coefficient receiving 1 point, as a reference value. The reason for
using the logistic regression model coefficients as a basis for the score is that in the
predictive model the risk score is linearly associated with the log-odds of the event. This
method is similar but not identical to that of Kato et al (28).
To validate the independence of each predictive covariate, we investigated the
predictive ability of three clinically validated risk stratification scores, namely the HFSS
score, Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) score, and the Kato model score (28-30) and
subsequently included the HFSS score and the Kato model score into our final multipredictor logistic regression model. HFSS is calculated using an algorithm which accounts
for the presence of multiple prognostic risk factors and baseline clinical characteristics,
specifically the presence of coronary artery disease, resting heart rate, mean arterial
blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, presence or absence of interventricular
conduction defect, peak VO2, and serum sodium (30-32). The Kato model score is a

recently described risk stratification tool that non-invasively assessed markers of left
sided and right sided congestion to guide risk assessment (28).
The time-to event distributions were generated separately for the two groups
based on STVR below and above the threshold, and for the four groups based on the
cross-classification of STVR below/above threshold and peak VO2 below/above
threshold, using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The relative risk in the different groups was
assessed via the hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazards model, and group
comparison was based on the log-rank test.
In supplemental analyses, we compared the demographic and clinical
characteristics of the two cohorts with STVR above and below the cut off. Comparison of
variables used independent Student’s t-tests for continuous variables, and Fisher’s exact
test for binary variables.
In all analyses p < 0.05 was considered significant; two-sided hypothesis tests and
confidence intervals were used throughout. Statistical analyses were performed using
Prism 8 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA) and Excel’s XLMiner
Analysis ToolPak (Microsoft Excel; Microsoft Corp, Bellevue, WA).

Among 104 patients, 16 patients (15.4%) required HTx, 8 required LVAD (7.7%)
and 15 (14.4%) patients died within 1 year after HTx evaluation. Thus, a total of 39
patients (37.5%) reached the primary composite end-point.
Univariate Analysis of Factors Associated with 1-Year Events
The results of the association of factors with 1-year events are shown in Table 2.
As continuous variables, higher NYHA functional class, lower STVR, higher VE/VCO 2
slope, lower AT VO2, lower peak oxygen pulse, lower HFSS score and decreased
hemoglobin levels were found to be significantly associated with events after HTx
evaluation. In addition, several hemodynamic parameters obtained from right heart
catheterization, including higher mean RA pressure, higher mean PA pressure, higher
PCWP, lower mixed venous oxygen saturation and decreased cardiac index, were
associated with one-year events. Lower RVSWI was not found to associated with 1-year
events in this patient population. As categorical variables, a score>4 by the Kato model
score was significantly correlated with 1-year events while the SHFM score predicting <
80% 1-year survival was not.

Multi-predictor Logistic Regression of Factors Associated with 1-Year Events

Subsequently, STVR, peak VO2, AT VO2, VE/VCO2 slope, peak oxygen pulse,
mean RA pressure, mean PA pressure, PCWP, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen
saturation, hemoglobin level, NYHA class, and HFSS were included in the multi-predictor
model. Stepwise backward logistic regression was used to arrive at the final predictive
model (table 3)—notably STVR<1.3, peak VO2<12 to 14 ml/kg/min or < 50% predicted
as per the 2016 ISHLT heart-transplant listing guidelines (7), and cardiac index<2.0 were
independently associated with clinical outcomes.

The HFSS score and Kato model score was subsequently added to a separate
multi-predictor model as previously described—the results of these three separate multipredictor models are shown in table 3. The OR was highest using STVR<1.3 and notably
higher than using peak VO2 criteria as per the ISHLT cut-off. Furthermore, STVR retained
its predictive ability when combined with the HFSS and the Kato model score in separate
models.

Comparison of HFrEF Patients Dichotomized by STVR

Using the cut-off of STVR<1.3, we categorized the HFrEF patients into two groups,
patients with normal STVR and patients with abnormal STVR as shown in Supplementary
Table S1. Interestingly, the two groups were remarkably similar in their clinical
characteristics with significant differences seen only in HFSS score, diuretic use, and
hemoglobin level. Abnormal CPET parameters differentiated the two groups further with
significantly decreased exercise time, AT SV, AT VO2, peak VO2, and VE/VCO2 slope in
the abnormal STVR group. When comparing the AT SV to rest SV, the normal STVR
patients showed the expected greater than 30% increase in SV at AT while the abnormal
STVR patients showed a trend towards slight decrease in SV at AT compared to SV at
rest. The comparison between these two patient groups exemplify the importance and
need for using CPET to identify patients who are at high risk for 1-year events.

Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves and ROC Analysis

The event-free rate from the time of HTx evaluation of patients with STVR > 1.3
and those < 1.3 is shown in Figure 1. The area under the curves of ROC analysis for
STVR was 0.865 and higher than any other single factor as shown in Figure 2A.

We subsequently created our own STVR risk score, as described in the statistical
methods section. In this model, STVR<1.3 is weighted 2 points, and peak VO2 below the
ISHLT cut-off and cardiac index<2.0 were both weighted 1 point. The ROC analysis using
this model showed that a cut-off of > 3 points yielded a sensitivity of 66.7%, a specificity
of 83.0% and the highest predictive accuracy of 76.3% for association with 1-year events
after CPET. In comparison with HFSS, SHFM and Kato risk model scores, we found the

Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves Using Cross-classification of STVR and Peak VO2

Figure 3 shows STVR provides additional useful prognostic information and can
be used to further risk stratify HFrEF patients beyond peak VO2. Figure 4 demonstrates
a useful schematic for cross-classification of HFrEF patients by STVR and peak VO 2.
Patients with peak VO2 above the 2016 ISHLT cut-off and abnormal STVR demonstrated
similar prognosis to HFrEF patients with peak VO2 below the ISHLT cut-off that were not
significantly different (Supplemental Figure S1). HFrEF patients with a peak VO2 below
the ISHLT cut-off but normal STVR showed similar prognosis to HFrEF patients with peak
VO2 greater than the ISHLT cut-off that were not significantly different (Supplemental
Figure S2). Cox proportional hazards analysis including STVR and peak VO2 as risk
factors for the composite event showed that abnormal STVR (HR 5.47, 95% CI 1.91,
15.62, p<0.002) and peak VO2 below the ISHLT cut-off (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.35, 5.43,
p=0.005) were both independently predictive of clinical events. Supplemental figure S3
shows cross-classification into four cohorts using STVR and peak VO 2. The top two
cohorts with the best survival were defined by normal STVR while the bottom two cohorts
with the worst survival were defined by abnormal STVR.

Discussion
Major Findings
In the present study, we have demonstrated that: (i) STVR, a novel CPET
parameter, is a better predictor of 1-year events, including death, HTx and LVAD
implantation, in HFrEF patients than traditional CPET parameters, i.e., peak VO2, AT VO2,
and VE/VCO2 slope; (ii) ambulatory HFrEF patients with an abnormal STVR have a
significant 1-year event rate of 54.1%; (iii) HFrEF patients with an abnormal STVR had a
poor 1-year prognosis regardless of their peak VO2; (iv) the novel risk-stratification model,
consisting of a simple scoring system of STVR<1.3 = 2 points, peak VO2 < ISHLT cut-off
= 1 point, and cardiac index<2 = 1 point, could sufficiently discriminate patients with a
high risk for 1-year events in this cohort.
STVR and CO
Peak VO2 derived from CPET has modest correlation with peak CO because it is
influenced by multiple additional factors, including age, gender, muscle deconditioning,
obesity, anemia, lung function, use of 𝛃-blockers, and also congenital heart disease (9,
10, 33). As a result, invasive hemodynamic parameters, usually CO, cardiac power output
or stroke work index, provided additional prognostic information beyond measurement of
peak VO2 (12, 13). In particular, in HFrEF patients with a peak VO2 below 14 ml/kg/min,
those patients who demonstrated a normal CO response demonstrated a similar survival
to patients with a peak VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min. Thus estimates of hemodynamic
parameters also discriminated between high and low risk patients among HFrEF patients
with low exercise tolerance (34).

SV correlates highly with VO2 during the initial and intermediate phases of exercise
up to the AT (11, 14, 16). However, after AT, SV will plateau and this relationship no
longer holds due to the relatively low r-squared between VO2 and arteriovenous oxygen
difference beyond 60% of maximal aerobic power (11, 16). Any further increase in CO
after AT is dictated by heart rate since the SV is essentially fixed. This understanding of
the relationship between SV and VO2 during exercise likely explains the limitation of using
peak oxygen pulse or peak VO2 pulse as a surrogate for SV despite accounting for heart
rate (11, 35, 36). Thus, we utilized the strong and predictable linear relationship with SV
and VO2 during the initial and intermediate exercise periods to calculate the STVR,
defined as SV at AT / SV at rest. Using previously published data from healthy subjects,
patients with HFrEF and patients with severe COPD, we subsequently defined a cut-off
by the area under the ROC curve to be STVR<1.3 to identify HFrEF patients with
abnormal STVR (16, 18-20, 22).
Therefore, we were able to use STVR as a noninvasive measure of CO response
at AT. By measuring the response in SV, this eliminates other contributing factors of peak
VO2. The reserve component of STVR is particularly novel. Other CPET parameters use
absolute thresholds despite patient differences or attempt to account for some of these
confounding variables using percent predicted thresholds. However, for all patients, we
still would reasonably expect them to mount an appropriate cardiac reserve to increased
metabolic demands. Thus, STVR identifies those high risk HFrEF patients who are unable
to demonstrate an appropriate increase in SV at AT. An additional value of STVR, that
should not be overlooked, is that it can be measured in patients who do not achieve
adequate exercise effort, often defined as a respiratory exchange ratio < 1.05, as long as

AT is reached. Of note, we observed an increased risk in death in patients who failed to
reach AT, a correlation also previously noted by Agostoni and colleagues (37). In the
current study, three out of the five HFrEF patients who failed to reach AT died within one
year. These patients were not included in this study.
Risk-stratification in HFrEF Patients
Currently, there are no universal criteria for identifying HFrEF patients who should
be evaluated for advanced heart-failure therapies (4). As a result, risk scores such as the
SHFM and HFSS are often used to identify HFrEF patients at high risk for 1-year events.
However, these scores show only fair prognostic accuracy (38) and in fact, only the HFSS
score showed predictive value in this study. The Kato model score (28), which focuses
on measures of surrogate markers of left and right sided dysfunction, showed predictive
value in our study and performed similarly to STVR alone, corroborating the utility of
STVR in risk stratification. Furthermore, our novel STVR risk score demonstrates superior
predictive accuracy compared to Kato model score. Thus, in a patient population where
accurate predictive factors have been historically difficult to identify, we show the
significant incremental value of utilizing STVR. In particular, STVR is most valuable in
identifying HFrEF patients at high risk for 1-year events who were initially considered low
risk by peak VO2 alone with “adequate” exercise tolerance. While these patients
(adequate peak VO2 with abnormal STVR) were thought to have favorable prognosis
associated with adequate peak VO2, poor cardiac reserve indicated by abnormal STVR
identifies their true high risk status inherently related to their end-stage cardiomyopathy.
Conversely, HFrEF patients that were initially considered to be high risk by peak VO2 who
demonstrate a normal cardiac reserve by STVR show a similar survival compared to

patients with a peak VO2 greater than the ISHLT cut-off. In other words, HFrEF patients
with low peak VO2 but normal STVR have other reasons that contribute to the low peak
VO2, such as deconditioning and anemia, which may improve with interventions such as
cardiac rehabilitation and improved nutritional status. Thus, cross-classification of HFrEF
patients using both STVR and peak VO2 may identify patients with “reversible” factors
(low peak VO2 with normal STVR) whose overall prognosis can improve while identifying
patients with poor cardiac reserve who remain at high risk for 1-year events despite their
seemingly adequate exercise tolerance (adequate peak VO2 with abnormal STVR).
Methodologic Considerations and Future Directions
Our study contains several limitations. First, this is a single center retrospective
cohort study and thus our observations need to be validated in other centers with larger
patient samples to confirm our results. Our patient population was predominantly older
males with coronary artery disease. That being said, our patient population is not
dissimilar to other studies evaluating HFrEF patients (2, 28, 39). Second, we did not
confirm our estimates of SV with noninvasive nor invasive determinations of CO.
Confirmation with direct measures of CO will help confirm whether inappropriate increase
in CO is the underlying reason for why STVR is able to identify patients at high risk for 1year events. Third, the VE/VCO2 slope was not measured through the entire exercise
period and instead, determined up to the AT. This was done by convention because of
the known steepening of VE beyond the anaerobic threshold for ventilatory compensation
for metabolic acidosis (14). However, other studies have shown additional clinical
information with use of all exercise data and therefore, there is a possibility that VE/VCO2
slope calculated from data throughout the exercise period would show further predictive

value (40, 41). Finally, this study was conducted using treadmill exercise only (preferred
modality in the United States (14)) and thus it is unknown whether the same conclusions
can be made in CPETs using a stationary cycle ergometer.
Future studies using STVR should be considered in other patient populations with
heart-failure, specifically heart-failure with preserved ejection fraction and congenital
heart disease patients. Additionally, it would be interesting to evaluate whether STVR can
accurately identify HFrEF patients who can significantly increase their peak VO2 after
cardiac rehabilitation. Finally, this study was conducted during the transition to the heart
allocation change by UNOS that took place in November 2018. Future studies will have
to take this into consideration as we would expect it change the time to hearttransplantation in ambulatory HFrEF patients.
Conclusion
STVR is a novel CPET parameter that better predicts 1-year prognosis than peak
VO2, VE/VCO2 slope and AT VO2 in HFrEF patients. Our STVR risk score using cut-off
values consisting of STVR<1.3, peak VO2 below the ISHLT cut-off, and cardiac index<2
shows improved prognostic accuracy compared to currently used risk scores such as
SHFM, HFSS and the Kato model score. Therefore, STVR should be considered when
evaluating HFrEF patients for advanced therapies.
