Abstract
Background: Concern has been raised about consequences of including patients with left
ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT) in readmission and mortality
measures.
Methods: We calculated unadjusted and hospital-specific 30-day risk-standardized mortality
(RSMR) and readmission (RSRR) rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a
primary diagnosis of AMI or HF discharged between July 2010 and June 2013. Hospitals were
compared before and after excluding LVAD and HT patients. LVAD indication was measured.
Results:
For the AMI and HF cohorts, <0.2% of patients received an LVAD and <0.1% received
HT in either cohort. Less than 2% of hospitals had either >6 patients who received an LVAD or,
independently, had >1 HT. The AMI mortality and readmission cohorts used 1.8% and 2.8% of
LVADs for semi-permanent/permanent indications, versus 73.8% and 78.0% for HF patients,
respectively. The rest were for temporary/external indications.
In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without LVAD patients versus hospitals with >6
LVADs was 14.8% and 14.3%, and RSRR was 17.8% and 18.3%, respectively; the HF cohort
RSMR was 11.9% and 9.7% and RSRR was 22.6% and 23.4%, respectively. In the AMI cohort,
RSMR for hospitals without versus with HT patients was 14.7% and 13.9% and RSRR was
17.8% and 17.7%, respectively; in the HF cohort, RSMR was 11.9% and 11.0%, and RSRR was
22.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Estimations changed <0.1% after excluding LVAD or HT
patients.
Conclusion:

Hospitals caring for >6 patients with LVAD or >1 HT had lower RSMRs but higher
RSRRs on average. Rates were insignificantly changed when these patients were excluded.
LVADs were primarily for acute-care in the AMI cohort and chronic support in the HF cohort.
LVAD and HT patients are a distinct group with differential care requirements and outcomes,
thus should be considered separately from the rest of the HF cohort.

Introduction:
LVADs and heart transplantations represent two advanced therapies for management of
AMI or HF. Devices have different indications depending on many patient level factors,
including the estimated length of time needed to support the failing heart and etiology of disease,
among others.(1) Some devices are delivered percutaneously for temporary hemodynamic
support, while others are implanted for intermediate to longer term support as destination therapy
or bridge to transplant. Use of LVADs has been increasing, particularly for their use as
destination therapy,(2) but also for temporary mechanical support.(3) Whereas, heart
transplantation is reserved for patients refractory to any other therapies,(4) the frequency of
which has recently remained stable over time due to lack of available donors.(5, 6)
Hospital 30-day readmission and mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
and heart failure (HF) patients have been publicly reported as performance measures and
incorporated into payment programs, such as the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program and
the Hospital Value Based Purchasing program.(7, 8) Some have raised concerns about the
appropriateness of including patients who receive LVAD devices in the measure cohorts due to
the distinct clinical care and monitoring these patients require and their increased risk for some
outcomes compared with other AMI and HF patients.(9) Differential consideration of this
population has precedent; HF patients receiving LVAD or heart transplantation were found to
have higher median payments and were excluded from 30-day episode of care heart failure
payment measures for CMS.(10)
Prior to 2016, publicly reported 30-day all-cause mortality and readmission measures
used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for patients admitted with AMI
or HF included patients who received a LVAD or heart transplantation during index hospital

admission.(11) We sought to examine the impact of LVAD and heart transplant patients on the
AMI and HF 30-day mortality and readmission measures and to determine the impact of
excluding them from the measures. Reporting on these findings is relevant to current practice
because these data were utilized by CMS in 2016 to determine inclusion and exclusion rules for
LVAD and heart transplant patients from 30-day mortality and readmission measures.
Materials and Methods:
Data
We used data from Medicare Fee-For-Service beneficiaries that were discharged from
July 2010 through June 2013. CMS uses 3 years of data for calculation of the HF and AMI 30day mortality and readmission measures. Study cohorts were defined consistent with CMS
methods for public reporting based on ICD-9CM codes for discharges from hospitals for
Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with a principal diagnosis of AMI or HF.(12-15)
Within each measure cohort, hospitalizations were assigned to one of four cohorts: LVAD or
non-LVAD recipients and heart transplant recipients and non-recipients. Inclusion in the cohorts
was defined by ICD-9CM procedure codes 37.60, 37.62, 37.65. 37.66. and 37.68 for the LVAD
cohort and 33.6 and 37.51 in the HF cohort. ICD-9CM codes for external temporary devices are
designated by 37.60, 37.62, 37.65, and 37.68 and for implanted semi-permanent or permanent
devices by 37.66.
Outcome Measures
The outcomes were 30-day, risk standardized mortality and readmission. Risk
standardized measures seek to adjust for case mix differences between hospitals based on
comorbidities and clinical status at the time of index admission. Additional analyses were

performed to include cases up to one year prior to the index admission and after excluding the
most common ICD-9CM code corresponding to external temporary LVADs (37.68).
Statistical Analysis
First, we calculated the frequency of patients who received an LVAD or heart transplant
in each of the four measure cohorts. We then separately calculated the frequencies of the use of
external temporary and implanted semi-permanent or permanent devices according to their
corresponding ICD-9CM codes. ICD-9CM code 37.66 corresponds to LVADs for semipermanent or permanent use, whereas 37.60, 37.62, 37.65. and 37.68 corresponds to those for
external/transient use. Unadjusted 30-day mortality and 30-day readmission rates at the patient
level were then determined for patients who did and did not receive a LVAD or heart
transplantation during the index admission.
We then estimated 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates (RSMR) and 30-day riskstandardized readmission rates (RSRR) for various groups at the hospital level. RSMR or RSRR
take into account the hierarchical structure of the data to account for patient clustering within
hospitals. Models include multiple covariates as well as hospital-specific random effects
intercept.(14, 15) The RSMR or RSRR is calculated as a ratio of the number of “predicted”
outcomes to the number of “expected” outcomes (death or readmission), multiplied by the
national adjusted rate of the given outcome. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the
outcome within 30 days predicted on the bases of the hospital’s performance within its observed
case mix and the denominator is the expected number of outcomes on the basis of the
performance of the nation’s “average” hospital within this hospital’s case mix.(16) Hospitals
were stratified into groups based on the number of LVAD or heart transplant patients within their
AMI or HF mortality and readmission cohorts over the time period. For LVAD, hospitals were

stratified as none, at least one, and 6 or more LVAD patients. For heart transplantation, hospitals
were stratified as having none or at least one heart transplantation patient.
For hospitals with at least one LVAD patient, 30-day RSMR and RSRR were reestimated after excluding patients who received an LVAD during the index hospitalization to
examine the impact of this exclusion on measure cohorts. Due to the low frequency of heart
transplantation patients, 30-day RSMR and RSRR were not recalculated after excluding heart
transplantations at hospitals with at least one heart transplant patient or recalculated after
combining LVAD and heart transplant patients. In a final analysis of the HF cohort, estimates
were repeated for patients who received an LVAD or heart transplantation during the index
admission with addition of those who also received one in the year prior to admission.
Observed readmission and mortality rates were reported as total number of patients and
percent experiencing the clinical event. 30-day RSMR and RSRR are reported as percentiles
(Median and interquartile range (IQR)) when comparing hospitals stratified by number of LVAD
or heart transplantation patients. When analyses were repeated to exclude LVAD patients, 30day median RSMR and RSRR are compared.
All analyses were done with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). This work
was exempted by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee.
Results:
LVAD and Transplant Index Admissions
LVAD and heart transplantation patients represented a small portion of the overall
measure cohort. The AMI mortality cohort (n = 506,543 patients) had 1,166 patients (0.23%)
who received an LVAD during index admission and 3 patients (<0.01%) who received a heart
transplantation. For the AMI readmission cohort (n = 526,309 patients), there were 1,016

patients (0.19%) who received an LVAD during index hospital admission and 3 patients
(<0.01%) who received a heart transplantation.
For the HF mortality cohort (n = 1,015,335 patients), there were 789 patients (0.08%)
who received an LVAD during index admission and 212 patients (0.02%) who received a heart
transplantation. For the HF readmission cohort (n = 1,254,124 patients) there were 931 patients
(0.07%) who received an LVAD during index hospital admission and 220 patients (0.02%) who
received a heart transplantation.
Type of LVAD used for AMI and HF Readmission and Mortality Cohorts
The AMI readmission and mortality cohorts most frequently used ICD-9CM codes that
represented indications for external temporary placed LVADs at 97.2% and 98.2%, respectively.
The HF cohorts differed in frequency of ICD-9CM codes used. The HF readmissions and
mortality cohorts most frequently used ICD-9CM codes that correspond to placement of
implanted semi-permanent or permanent LVADs at 78.0% and 73.8%, respectively. See Table 1
for frequency of ICD-9CM code utilization for AMI and HF mortality and readmission cohorts.

Patients admitted for AMI who received an LVAD had higher unadjusted mortality and
readmission rates than those who did not receive an LVAD (mortality: 42.5% (95% confidence
interval (CI), 39.7%, 45.3%) vs. 14.8% (95% CI, 14.7%, 14.9%); readmission: 23.0% (95% CI,
20.4%, 25.6%) vs 17.8% (95% CI, 17.7%, 17.9%)). There were too few heart transplantation
patients to make definitive comparisons on mortality and readmission in the AMI cohort.
Patients admitted for HF who received an LVAD had similar mortality, but higher readmission
rates than those who did not receive an LVAD (mortality:10.8% (95% CI, 8.6%, 13.0%) vs.

Risk-Standardized Mortality and Readmission Rates
For both the AMI and HF mortality and readmission cohorts, the vast majority of
hospitals did not have any patients who received an LVAD. Less than 2% of hospitals had six or
more Medicare patients who received an LVAD. Similar findings were also observed for
hospitals that did or did not have heart transplantation patients, with less than 2% of hospitals
performing heart transplantation.
For the AMI cohort, the median RSMRs for hospitals with 0, 1+, and 6+ LVAD patients
were similar at 14.8% (IQR, 13.9, 15.8%), 14.4% (IQR, 13.4%, 15.6%), and 14.3% (IQR,
13.4%, 15.4%), respectively, while the median RSRRs were also similar at 17.8% (IQR, 17.2%,
18.5%), 18.0% (IQR, 17.1%, 18.9%), 18.3% (IQR, 17.4%, 18.9%), respectively. The median
RSMRs for hospitals with no heart transplantations compared to at least one heart transplantation
were 14.7% (IQR, 13.8%, 15.8%) and 13.9% (IQR, 12.4%, 15.1%), respectively, while the

<0.1% difference from the prior median RSMR and RSRR for hospitals with 1+ LVAD.
Evaluation of the heart failure cohort with LVAD and heart transplant patients combined
After combining patients who received a LVAD or heart transplantation during the index
admission or at any time in the year prior to admission and excluding ICD-9CM code 37.68 in
the HF cohort, these patients again account for a minority of the patient populations (0.10% in
the mortality cohort; 0.10% in the readmission cohort). The mortality rate of these combined
patients in the HF cohort was 6.9% (95% CI, 5.3%, 8.5%) compared to the non-LVAD and nonheart transplantation patient rate of 12.0% (95% CI, 11.9%, 12.1%). The median hospital-level
RSMR did not differ when including or excluding patients with LVAD or heart transplantation at
11.9% (IQR,11.0%, 13.0%). The readmission rate for this combined cohort was 30.6% (95% CI,
28.0%, 33.2%) compared to the non-LVAD and non-heart transplantation patient rate of 22.7%
(95% CI, 22.6%, 22.8%). The median hospital-level RSRR was also the same when including or
excluding patients with LVAD or heart transplant at 22.6% (IQR, 21.7%, 23.7). See Table 5.

When narrowed to hospitals with at least one LVAD or one transplant patient, RSMR for
hospitals were unchanged with inclusion or exclusion of LVAD and heart transplant patients at
11.0% (IQR, 10.2%, 11.9%). The RSRR for this comparison was also similar at 22.6% (IQR,
21.4%, 24.0%) compared to 22.7% (IQR, 21.3%, 24.0%) when excluding such patients. See

Discussion:
In this study, risk standardized outcome rates for hospitals that cared for LVAD or heart
transplant patients tended to have slightly lower mortality and slightly higher readmission rates
compared to those that did not care for such patients; differences were mostly less than 1% and
in many cases less than 0.5%. Hospitals caring for LVAD and transplant patients do not have
substantially different risk-standardized outcome rates than other hospitals likely because LVAD
and transplant patients represent a small proportion of hospitals’ overall patients and because
much of the difference in observed outcome rates is explained by comorbidities and severity of
illness in these patients that are captured in the risk-standardized models. Thus, exclusion of
LVAD and heart transplant patients resulted in <0.1% change in results. These observations,
including the differences in typical indication for LVAD use in the AMI and HF populations
were considerations in the CMS decision to exclude LVAD and heart transplant patients from
HF, but not AMI, mortality and readmission measures.
In all of the cohorts evaluated, RSMR was always lower among hospitals that cared for
LVAD or heart transplant patients. The fact that exclusion of such patients from the measure did
not result in differences more than 0.1%, suggests that the observed differences are either a result
of differential case mix or hospital care. The utilized model adjusts for case mix, thus making
this less likely the cause for the differences and suggests centers capable of LVAD may have
other factors that contribute to lower mortality aside from LVAD use.
The results of the RSRR can help us better understand these differences. Across all
cohorts, RSRR were slightly higher in the LVAD cohorts and <0.1% different in the heart
transplant cohorts. Again, exclusion of LVAD and heart transplant patients changed these values
by <0.1%. Thus, hospitals that cared for LVAD and heart transplant patients achieved lower

RSMR despite slightly higher RSRR. Again, since our model corrects for case mix, this again
supports their being difference in hospital level care required to achieve a lower mortality rate
despite a population with a higher readmission rate. This differential overall is interpreted as
better outcomes from hospitals that care for LVAD and heart transplant patients that are
independent on the utilization of LVAD or heart transplantation. Part of these difference is likely
due to these hospitals having other unmeasured factors that allow them to handle the complexity
of care required for LVAD and heart transplant patients.
These data were utilized by CMS to update mortality and readmission measures.
Although the proportion of patients that received advanced therapies remains a small proportion
and a minority of hospitals use these therapies, key considerations at the patient and hospital
level were important for this decision. The clinically different scenarios and treatment goals that
elicit use of LVAD and heart transplant in AMI as compared with HF plus their differential use
in these populations and differences in unadjusted and risk adjusted mortality and readmission
rates were all used by CMS for whether to continue including LVAD and heart transplant
patients in reported measures. In 2016, CMS updated mortality and readmission measures to
continue including LVAD and heart transplantation patients in AMI measures, but exclude
LVAD and heart transplantation patients from HF measures.(17, 18)
Measuring and publicly reporting hospital level performance measures requires diligence
to ensure that these measures accurately reflect patient care at the hospital level. This includes
carefully adjusting for disease severities and case heterogeneity between hospitals. As we
continue to understand these contexts, measures should continue to be revised in response.
Our study also has limitations. This study utilized a non-matched cohort and this limits
interpretation of mortality and readmission rates between groups obtaining LVAD or heart

transplantation. Additionally, since data were not available as to type of LVAD utilized,
comparisons could not be made between types of LVAD (i.e. centrifugal vs. axial vs.
percutaneously inserted devices). In addition, more robust hospital level data were not available
to compare hospital level factors that may have contributed to mortality or readmission between
hospitals that were and were not utilizers of heart transplantation or LVAD.
Conclusion:
In conclusion we report that hospitals caring for patients with LVAD or performed heart
transplants had lower RSMR but higher RSRR on average, which were not significantly changed
when these patients were excluded. These differences are likely a result of hospital level
differences in care that amount to better mortality result in hospitals capable of caring for LVAD
and transplant patients. In 2016, CMS decided to exclude LVAD and transplant patients from HF
mortality and readmission measures, due in part to these findings. Continued assessment of
select patient populations can inform on the optimal populations to track for AMI and HF
mortality and readmission measures.
