Abstract
Background: Persistent formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core feature of schizophrenia.
Recent cognitive and neuroimaging studies indicate a distinct mechanistic pathway
underlying the persistent positive FTD (pFTD or disorganized thinking), though its
structural determinants are still elusive. Using network-based cortical thickness
estimates from ultra-high field 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7T MRI), we
investigated the structural correlates of pFTD.
Methods: We obtained speech samples and 7T MRI anatomical scans from medicated
clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (n=19) and healthy controls (n=20). Networkbased morphometry was used to estimate the mean cortical thickness of 17 functional
networks covering the entire cortical surface from each subject. We also quantified the
vertexwise variability of thickness within each network to quantify the spatial coherence
of the 17 networks, estimated patients vs. controls differences, and related the thickness
of the affected networks to the severity of pFTD.
Results: Patients had reduced thickness of the frontoparietal and default mode networks,
and reduced spatial coherence affecting the salience and the frontoparietal control
network. A higher burden of positive FTD related to reduced frontoparietal thickness and
reduced spatial coherence of the salience network. The presence of positive FTD, but
not its severity, related to the reduced thickness of the language network comprising of
the superior temporal cortex.
Conclusions: These results suggest that cortical thickness of both cognitive control and
language networks underlie the positive FTD in schizophrenia. The structural integrity of
cognitive control networks is a critical determinant of the expressed severity of persistent
FTD in schizophrenia.

Introduction
Formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core clinical feature of schizophrenia (Jerónimo et al.,
2018). Presence of FTD predicts transition to psychosis in individuals at high risk of
schizophrenia, predating the actual onset by several years (Bearden et al., 2011;
Demjaha et al., 2017; DeVylder et al., 2014; Gooding et al., 2013; Wilcox et al., 2014).
FTD is also indicative of higher illness severity (Roche et al., 2015) and poor sociooccupational outcomes (Roche et al., 2016) in first episode psychosis. While FTD seen
in acute psychosis often resolves with time, persistence of FTD in those with established
illness affects therapeutic alliance (Cavelti et al., 2016), social functioning (Palaniyappan
et al., 2019b; Sousa et al., 2019) and occupational recovery (Harrow and Marengo,
1986), thus reducing the overall quality of life (Tan et al., 2014; Ulas et al., 2008).
Despite this, our current understanding of the mechanistic basis of FTD is limited and
treatment approaches are elusive (Kircher et al., 2018).

Two recent state-of-art syntheses in FTD highlight the substantial inconsistencies in the
neuroimaging observations reported to date (Cavelti et al., 2018a; Sumner et al., 2018a).
While functional MRI studies often employ linguistic tasks that preferentially implicate
language network in FTD (Cavelti et al., 2018a; Sumner et al., 2018b; Wensing et al.,
2017), structural MRI studies report more distributed abnormalities in both the language
network and non-language specific networks (Cavelti et al., 2018a; Sumner et al.,
2018a). In particular, the two distinct domains of FTD – positive FTD (characterised by
looseness, peculiar word/sentence or illogicality) and negative FTD (characterised by
reduced fluency, speed and content) – are thought to have distinct neurocognitive
correlates (Bora et al., 2019; Tan and Rossell, 2017) but are not often parsed in
neuroimaging studies. A small number of studies that parse these 2 dimensions identify
structural deficits that extend beyond the language network (Palaniyappan et al., 2015;
Sans-Sansa et al., 2013) in negative FTD. Nevertheless, the structural basis of positive
FTD continues to be elusive in most studies (Cavelti et al., 2018b; Palaniyappan et al.,
2015; Winkelbeiner et al., 2018; but see Sans-Sansa et al., 2013).
The mechanistic basis of positive FTD is particularly challenging to elucidate as the
clinical features are often subtle (Cohen et al., 2017; Sommer et al., 2010), fluctuate with
acute psychotic symptoms (Li et al., 2019) and easily missed during cross-sectional
clinical interviews (de Bruin et al., 2007; Palaniyappan, 2009). Furthermore, most
morphometric studies in FTD quantify the composite measure of grey matter volume
(except (Winkelbeiner et al., 2018)). Cortical thickness is much more sensitive
morphological metric that provides insights into dynamic structural remodeling related to
longitudinal changes in symptom trajectories (Guo et al., 2016; Palaniyappan et al.,
2019a)). While volume changes may result from non-specific morphometric effects
(Palaniyappan and Liddle, 2012; Panizzon et al., 2009), thickness changes are
increasingly linked to intracortical myelination and dendritic spine branching (Shin et al.,
2018; Storsve et al., 2014), thus enabling us to hone in on cellular processes underlying

the suspected structural changes in FTD (Kircher et al., 2018). There are no whole brain
studies relating cortical thickness to FTD to date.
The thickness of cerebral cortex varies across individuals as well as across different
cortical regions within an individual. Across subjects, the cortical thickness of one region
of a functional network co-varies tightly with other regions that constitute the functional
network possibly due to shared trophic influences and/or coordinated maturational
programming (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013b, 2013a). Spatially distributed regions within
a defined functional network show consistent task-related recruitment, which can also
have a plastic influence on the observed structural covariance (Kelly and Castellanos,
2014). At an individual level, pathological processes disrupting this maturational or
functional coherence can result in higher than expected degree of variability within largescale networks (Kong et al., 2019, 2014), resulting in spatial incoherence. Interestingly,
patients with schizophrenia show both relative thinning and thickening of cortex when
compared to controls, in functionally linked brain regions (e.g. thinning of posterior
cingulate, but thickening of precuneus, within the same default-mode network as shown
by van Erp et al., 2018), which can result in increased spatial incoherence within
functional networks. We quantified the network-level thickness and its spatial
incoherence in 17 cortical networks covering the entire cortical surface, identified on the
basis of well-replicated patterns of intrinsic connectivity (Yeo et al., 2011).
The aim of the present study was to investigate if the severity of positive FTD varies with
illness-related changes in cortical thickness in schizophrenia. To this end we utilised the
same sample previously reported (in Palaniyappan et al., 2015) to first delineate the
cortical networks showing significant thinning and spatial incoherence in patients with
schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. We then studied if positive FTD was
associated with the thickness and coherence of the affected cortical networks. Given the
prior findings implicating language networks in FTD (Kircher et al., 2018), we
investigated if structural changes in language networks showing intrinsic functional
connectivity independently explain the variance in the severity of positive FTD, in
addition to the illness-related morphometric changes.

Methods
Participants
20 patients receiving community based care for a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) diagnosis of
schizophrenia were specifically recruited in a stable phase of illness for this study. 21
healthy controls group matched for age, gender and parental socioeconomic status were
also recruited. 1 patient and 1 control were excluded due to motion artifacts affecting
cortical surface reconstruction. Subjects with neurological disorders, current substance
dependence, or intelligence quotient (IQ) < 70 (Ammons and Ammons, 1962) were
excluded. Healthy subjects were also excluded if there was a personal or family history
of psychosis. All subjects were recruited from the county of Nottinghamshire, UK with
informed consent to participate obtained in accordance with the approval from the
National Research Ethics Committee, Nottinghamshire.
.
Clinical Assessment
The diagnosis was made through a consensus procedure as per Leckman et al., (1982),
using multiple sources of information including clinical notes, information provided by
treating clinicians as well a structured diagnostic interview (Liddle et al., 2002). The
clinical stability was assessed as <10 points change in Global Assessment of Function
[GAF, DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994)] score in the 6 weeks prior to
study participation.
Patents and healthy controls were interviewed on the same day as the scan using the
validated procedure for administering Thought Language Index (Liddle et al., 2002).
Subjects were asked to describe 3 pictures from Thematic Apperception Test (Murray,
1943), for one minute each, with follow-up questions raised by the interviewer if needed.
The free speech samples were recorded and later transcribed by a team member with
no direct contact with the subject and blind to the diagnostic status, symptom burden
and neuroimaging findings. Positive FTD was defined as the summed score of
looseness, peculiar word, peculiar sentence and peculiar logic were classified as
positive FTD while the scores of perseveration, poverty of speech and weakening of goal
were summed as negative FTD, as in our previous study (Palaniyappan et al., 2015). All
patients in our sample had English as their first language.
Handedness was assessed using the 12-items Annett scale (Annett, 1970). The median
defined daily dose (DDD) of antipsychotics (WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug
Statistics and Methodology, 2003) was calculated for all patients.

MRI acquisition and processing

The procedures for MRI acquisition are described in our previous report (Palaniyappan
et al., 2015). In summary, T1 weighted images were acquired from a 7T Philips Achieva
(32-channel coil) using a 3D Magnetization Prepared-Turbo Field Echo (IR-TFE) with
0.6 mm isotropic resolution, 192 × 180 × 140 mm matrix, TR = 15 ms, TE = 5.6 ms, shot
interval = 3 s, and flip angle 8°. Bias field inhomogeneity was reduced using an
optimized inversion pulse (adiabatic pulse). We have previously shown that in this
sample, the total grey matter tissue volume estimated from the 3T and 7T scans from
the same subjects were not different (paired t test t=0.18, p=0.9) and were very highly
correlated (r = 0.93, p<.001), indicating that there were no systematic differences in the
tissue segmentation of 7T scans due to bias inhomogeneity (Iwabuchi et al., 2013). T1
weighted images were resliced (1 mm isotropic) and surface extraction and cortical
parcellation for each individual structural image was carried out using Freesurfer version
5.1 (Fischl et al., 1999). The preprocessing followed the standard description available at
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Image processing for morphometry was carried out
blind to diagnosis. Cortical thickness was computed in accordance with the standard
processing routines using Freesurfer with no control-point editing being required for this
dataset (McCarthy et al., 2015). For this study, we employed Yeo’s Functional Atlas (17networks) to parcellate the entire cortical surface (Yeo et al., 2011). Medial wall of the
reconstructed hemispheres near the ventricles, proximal to the corpus callosum, was not
included. The mean thickness of all vertices that were confined within the boundaries of
the parcellated regions provided the network’s thickness value, averaged across the 2
hemispheres. To compute the index for spatial coherence, we calculated the standard
deviation of vertex wise thickness within each network, expressed as a ratio of the mean
thickness (coefficient of variation of thickness, CVT). Higher CVT of a network in a
subject indicates lower spatial coherence within the network for that individual. This
computation is described in Figure 1. Thus, we obtained 17 mean thickness and CVT
values for further analysis. A template identifying these networks is shown in
Supplemental Figure 1.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical tests were carried out using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). T
tests, Mann–Whitney U tests for non-normal data and chi-square tests for proportions
were used to compare clinical and demographic variables between patients and
controls. Independent 2-tailed t-tests were used to compare CVT and mean cortical
thickness of 17 networks between patients and healthy controls with False Discovery
Rate (FDR) corrected p<0.05 considered as statistically significant for the 34
comparisons that were made. We then used nonparametric correlation (Kendall’s rank
correlation coefficient tau (Kendall, 1938)) to relate the TLI positive FTD scores to the
CVT and mean thickness values of the networks with diagnostic differences, with FDR
correction applied for the multiple correlations.
When undertaking a correlation with symptom severity, we assume that the scores vary
continuously with brain structure. But structural changes may relate to the discrete
presence and not vary continuously with severity. To ensure that our interpretations are

not biased by this assumption, we divided the patient sample into binary categories
based on the presence of positive FTD (pFTD+ vs pFTD-) defined as scores of >0.25
summed positive FTD score (disorganization), in line with the original work on TLI. The
CVT and mean thickness values of the networks with diagnostic differences were
directly compared between pFTD+ and pFTD- groups.
To test the specificity of our findings to positive FTD, we also repeated the above
analyses with negative FTD scores. We also removed the variance in grey matter
thickness and CVT explained by current antipsychotic defined daily dose (DDD), age,
IQ, global functioning (GAF scores), and total intracranial volume and related the
residuals to positive and negative FTD to establish specificity of the observed
relationships.

Results
Demographic and clinical features of the sample are presented in Table 1, highlighting
match for age, gender and parental socioeconomic status between the 2 groups.
Diagnostic differences
Network-based thickness differences between patients and healthy controls are shown
in Table 2 (with descriptive labels as per Baker et al., 2014). The frontoparietal network
and the midline default mode network showed the most significant reduction in cortical
thickness (networks #12 and #16 of Yeo atlas) in patients when compared to controls.
The cingulo-insular salience network and the frontoparietal networks (#8 and #12) had
higher CVT in patients compared to controls, indicating spatial incoherence within these
cognitive control networks in patients with schizophrenia.
Relationship with positive FTD
A higher CVT of the salience network (tau = 0.41 p = 0.024) and lower mean thickness
in frontoparietal network (tau = -0.498, p = 0.006) predicted the severity of positive FTD
(after FDR correction). CVT of the frontoparietal network (tau = 0.298, p = 0.10) and
mean thickness of the default mode network (tau = -0.355, p = 0.05) did not show a
significant relationship with the severity of positive FTD, even at the uncorrected level.
Residuals adjusted for the linear influence of antipsychotic dose, age, IQ, overall
functioning, and total intracranial volume continued to demonstrate a significant
relationship between higher CVT of the salience network (tau = 0.37 p = 0.04; Figure 2)
and lower mean thickness in frontoparietal control network (tau = -0.48, p = 0.008) with
the severity of positive FTD. Positive FTD did not relate to the adjusted residuals of other
structural measures involving the default mode and the language networks.
In direct group comparison, pFTD+ group showed significant reduction in mean
thickness of the frontoparietal control network (t = 2.93, p=0.009) and increase in spatial

incoherence indexed by CVT of the salience network (t=-2.96, p=0.009), indicating that
both the presence and the severity of positive FTD is influenced by these 2 networks.
FTD and the structure of language networks
We did not find significant correlations between the mean thickness and CVT of the 2
language networks (#14 and 17 of Yeo atlas) that include Wernicke’s and Broca’s
regions and positive FTD scores, even at an uncorrected level (absolute values of tau
=0.18 to 0.30; p= 0.06-0.31). Nevertheless, pFTD+ group showed a significant reduction
in mean thickness of the auditory network that included superior temporal cortex (#14) (t
= 3.68, p=0.002) when compared to the pFTD- group, indicating that the presence of
positive FTD, rather than its severity, is influenced by the structure of the language
network comprising of superior temporal gyrus.
Furthermore, we did not find significant correlations between the thickness and CVT of
the frontoparietal network, CVT of the salience network, the thickness of default network
or the mean thickness and CVT of the 2 language networks (#14 and 17) with negative
FTD scores, even at an uncorrected level (absolute values of tau = 0.07-0.32; p= 0.090.71). On binary analysis, nFTD+ group showed a significant reduction in mean
thickness of the network that included middle temporal gyrus (#17) (t = 2.3, p=0.034)
when compared to the nFTD- group, but this did not survive FDR correction for the t
tests involving the language networks. Adjusting for the linear influence of antipsychotic
dose, age, IQ, overall functioning, and total intracranial volume did not alter these
results.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating cortical thickness of functional
networks in relation to FTD in schizophrenia. In this study, we have shown that (1)
clinically stable and medicated individuals with schizophrenia exhibit reduced thickness
of the frontoparietal and default mode networks, and spatial incoherence affecting the
salience and the frontoparietal network (2) Patients with more severe burden of positive
FTD had reduced frontoparietal network thickness and spatial coherence of the salience
network (3) The presence of positive FTD, but not its severity, related to the reduced
thickness of the auditory network comprising of the superior temporal cortex. Taken
together, these results indicate that the severity of FTD is contingent upon the degree to
which domain-general control aspects of information processing (i.e. frontoparietal and
salience systems (Cole et al., 2014; Fedorenko et al., 2013)) are affected in
schizophrenia, over and above the structural deficits in the language areas (i.e. temporal
cortex).
While the reduced thickness of the frontoparietal and default mode regions has been
reported consistently in many previous studies of schizophrenia (Ehrlich et al., 2012;
Heinrichs et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018; Shafiei et al., 2019), the presence of spatial
incoherence has not been investigated so far to our knowledge. The presence of higher
than expected variation in the vertexwise thickness of large-scale cortical networks

involved in information processing (salience and frontoparietal cognitive control) may
indicate the possibility of a disturbance in coordinated structural maturation (AlexanderBloch et al., 2013b). A developmental lag in intracortical myelination or synaptic pruning
(Fjell et al., 2015) of one region relative to the others within a network can result in such
incoherence. Given the genetic control of intracortical myelination of during adolescence
is closely related to the risk of schizophrenia (Whitaker et al., 2016), this possibility
requires further investigation. It is also possible that the harmonious functional
deployment of the network nodes do not occur as expected in patients, leading to a
structural reconfiguration indicated by increased vertex-wise variance in thickness. This
possibility has been raised previously in a study of spatial topography of functional
connectivity in schizophrenia (Skudlarski et al., n.d.). While the results presented here
cannot distinguish these two mechanisms, our results indicate that within-subject
structural variability is an useful source of information to understand the elusive neural
basis of complex symptoms such as formal thought disorder.
Our results partially confirm the long suspected role of language network in positive
FTD, and add further clarity to the putative mechanistic basis of the observed
disorganized thinking in schizophrenia. While structural changes involving both the
cognitive control (frontoparietal and salience) and the language (auditory) network are
seen in patients with positive FTD, the severity of the clinically expressed FTD relies on
the degree to which the control systems are affected. In particular, both a reduction in
the amount of grey matter tissue in the frontoparietal network and the variable
distribution of grey matter within the salience network, appear to mediate the expressed
severity of the disorganized thought in schizophrenia. This is consistent with the
previously reported relationship between disorganisation and the disturbed functional
relationships between the nodes of the salience network (ACC and insula)(Liddle et al.,
1992), as well as a recent observation that the functional flexibility of the salience
network predicts conceptual disorganisation but not the negative symptoms (Supekar et
al., 2019). The notion of ‘cognitive control systems’ tuning the expression of a language
system abnormality is in line with the current notions on cognitive control of language
(Blank et al., 2014; Fedorenko and Varley, 2016), and consistent with the clinical
observations that the severity of FTD increases when excessive cognitive demands (e.g.
distraction, longer conversations) are placed on an individual with schizophrenia (Becker
et al., 2012; Docherty, 2012).
In our previous study, we noted that a reduction in grey matter volume involving the
insula, precuneus and lateral temporal regions in the presence of an increase in grey
matter volume involving the cingulate and lateral prefrontal regions predicted higher
burden of negative FTD, but not the positive FTD (Palaniyappan et al., 2015). Our
current observations relate positive FTD to the salience (insula, ACC) and lateral
frontoparietal as well as the auditory network (lateral temporal) structure; such a
relationship was not seen for negative FTD. The lack of relationship between cortical
thickness and negative FTD is in line with one previous report (Winkelbeiner et al.,
2018), and indicate that maturational defects that affect morphometric properties other

than thickness (e.g. surface area or gyrification (Palaniyappan and Liddle, 2012)) may
be more critical for developing negative FTD. Taken together, these results indicate that
both forms of persistent FTD result from cross-network structural aberrations involving
both the language-specific as well as cognitive control systems.
There are several limitations in our study. First, we had a limited sample size that
precluded us from undertaking a mass univariate approach to the analysis.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that we had sufficient power to reject the 2 primary
null hypotheses (no patient vs. control differences and lack of structural correlates of
positive FTD) with a low probability of false discovery. The possibility of type 2 error due
to small sample cannot be fully dismissed for the null results relating to the language
network and secondary analysis of the negative FTD scores. We urge caution when
interpreting these negative results. Second, unlike Sans-Sansa et al. (2013), our patient
sample was selected for its clinical stability but not for exhibiting FTD. While this may be
a limitation, this enabled us to capture the milder but persistent aspects of FTD and thus
provided a more representative sample when seeking morphological correlates of
persistent as opposed to acute FTD. Third, we did not measure the subjective
component of thought disorder that can be quantified using more recent instruments
such as the Thought and Language Disorder (TALD) scale (Kircher et al., 2014).
Nevertheless, most of the existing FTD-specific instruments consistently differentiate the
positive and negative FTD dimensions, indicating that the biological mechanisms
discussed here are likely to be valid irrespective of the specific instrument employed.
In summary, we demonstrate that the cortical thickness of both cognitive control and
language networks underlie the positive FTD in schizophrenia. The structural integrity of
cognitive control networks is a critical determinant of the expressed severity of persistent
FTD in schizophrenia.

Figure 1: Estimating thickness-based spatial coherence within a functional
network
I. For each vertex on grey-white boundary, the tangential distance to pial boundary provides a
vertex-specific thickness measure, extracted using Freesurfer-based surface reconstruction. II.
Using Yeo’s 17 functional networks, the anatomical boundaries are defined for cortical networks.
For any given network (Salience Network in this example), included regions are spatially
distributed, with thickness varying across the vertices. III. Vertices that make up each network
show variable thickness, that can be averaged to obtain mean thickness of the functional
network, while standard deviation across the vertices provides the measure of variability.
Disruptions in the coordinated maturation and/or functional co-activation within these networks
may result in increased variability in thickness across the network IV. Hypothetical vertexwise
thickness values plotted in a spatial continuum for 4 subjects. Subject A shows moderate degree
of variability with average mean thickness; Subject B shows low variability as well as low mean
thickness; Subject C shows high degree of variability with high mean thickness; Subject D shows
low variability but high mean thickness. V. As variability scales with mean values (Taylor’s law),
the spatial coherence within a network is best captured by the coefficient of variation (CV =
mean/standard deviation).

Figure 2: Relationship between spatial incoherence of the Salience Network and
positive formal thought disorder

Residual of CVT of Salience Network

The residuals linearly adjusted for age, gender, intracranial volume, IQ, global functioning and
antipsychotic dose are plotted on y-axis, and summed scores of positive formal thought disorder
on the x-axis. Note that the scatter-plot depicts the linear relationship, while non-parametric
correlations were used in the statistical analysis. CVT: Coefficient of Variation of Thickness; FTD:
Formal Thought disorder; TLI: Thought & Language Index.
