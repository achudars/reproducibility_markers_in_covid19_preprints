requirements in acute hospitals: a multi-centre observational study

23

Abstract

25

Objectives

26

To determine the precision of nurse staffing establishments estimated using the

27

SNCT patient classification system, and to assess whether the recommended staff

28

levels correspond with professional judgements of adequate staffing.

29

Setting / population

30

81 medical/surgical units in 4 acute care hospitals.

31

Methods

32

Nurses assessed patients using the SNCT and reported on the adequacy of staffing

33

at least daily for one year. Bootstrap samples of varying sizes were used to estimate

34

the precision of the tool’s recommendations for the number of nurses to employ on

35

each unit. Multi-level regression models were used to assess the association

36

between shortfalls from the measured staffing requirement and nurses’ assessments

37

of adequate staffing.

38

Results

39

The recommended minimum sample of 20 days allowed the required number to

40

employ to be estimated with a mean precision of 4.1%. For most units, much larger

41

samples were required to estimate establishments within +/- 1 whole time staff

42

member. Every registered nurse hour per patient day shortfall in staffing was

43

associated with an 11% decrease in the odds of nurses reporting that there were

44

enough staff to provide quality care and a 14% increase in the odds of reporting that

45

necessary nursing care was left undone. No threshold indicating an optimal staffing

46

level was observed. Surgical specialty, patient turnover and more single bedded

47

rooms were associated with lower odds of staffing adequacy.

48

Conclusions

49

The SNCT can provide reliable estimates of the number of nurses to employ on a

50

unit, but larger samples than the recommended minimum are usually required. The

51

SNCT provides a measure of nursing workload that correlates with professional

52

judgements, but the recommended staffing levels may not be optimal. Some sources

53

of systematic variations in staffing requirements for some units are not accounted

54

for. SNCT measurements are a potentially useful adjunct to professional judgement,

55

but cannot replace it.

Introduction

61

In acute care hospitals, the ability to determine the ‘right’ number of nursing staff to

62

employ and to deploy on any given shift is an imperative, as nurse staffing levels

63

influence both efficiency and quality of care delivery. On the one hand, professional

64

nurses and nursing support staff form the largest group of staff and the largest

65

variable costs faced by hospitals. Nursing budgets are thus frequently targeted in the

66

drive for cost savings.1 On the other hand, inadequate nurse staffing is linked to

67

deficits in the quality and safety of care.2 However, despite the existence of many

68

tools to determine staffing requirements and an extensive literature, evidence about

69

the ability of any tool to reliably and accurately estimate staffing requirements is

70

extremely limited.3, 4 In this paper, we consider the “Safer Nursing Care Tool”

71

(SNCT), which is used in the majority of acute hospitals in the United Kingdom’s

72

National Health Service(NHS) 5 and endorsed by the National Institute for Health and

73

Care Excellence (NICE),6 the body that produces evidence based guidelines for the

74

NHS. We explore the reliability and precision of the estimates of required staffing

75

establishments (that is the number of nurses to employ for a hospital unit) made

76

using the tool and the extent to which estimated staffing requirements correspond

77

with professional judgement of sufficient staffing. Despite the tool’s widespread use

78

and the importance of these considerations, these factors have not been previously

79

studied.

80

Associations between higher registered nurse staffing levels in hospitals and

81

improved care quality have been demonstrated in many studies. 2, 7-9 Outcomes

82

include lower risks of in-hospital mortality 10, shorter lengths of stay 11 and fewer

83

omissions of necessary care.12 Such findings have underpinned policies to make

84

minimum nurse staffing levels mandatory in some jurisdictions, most notably

85

California in the USA. Yet studies showing associations between nurse staffing

86

levels and outcomes rarely provide a clear indication of how many staff are needed

87

for different patients, despite evidence that needs can vary considerably, nor do

88

most studies demonstrate tipping points in relationships, which could be one

89

indication of an optimal staffing level.2

90

Consequently, tools and systems to guide decisions about the number of nursing

91

staff to employ, or to deploy on any given shift are still widely used either in

92

conjunction with or as an alternative to mandatory minimums. At the heart of most

93

tools is some form of patient level assessment, which is translated into a measure of

94

required nursing time.3, 4 Many such tools exist, although they are largely

95

unsupported by robust evidence. Studies used to support the validity of tools to

96

determine staffing requirements simply tend to show that staff demand estimated

97

using a given tool correlates with some other measure of demand. In the absence of

98

a gold standard, and without addressing whether the staffing according to the

99

predicted level is sufficient to deliver the required care, such evidence is significantly

100

limited. Different tools, while providing results that are highly correlated, can and do

101

give dramatically different estimates of the staffing required by the same group of

102

patients.4 For example applying a new system to estimate the staffing required for

103

low acuity wards resulted in an estimate that was double that derived from the

104

existing system.13

105

Furthermore, although a key driver for choosing to use a tool is the assertion that

106

variable patient need cannot be efficiently met by fixed staffing levels,14 little

107

consideration has been given to the impact of variation on the resulting estimates of

108

average staffing requirements. Inter-rater reliability and agreement is often reported,

109

the precision with which the unit staffing requirement as a whole is estimated, either

110

on a given day or over time, is not. 4

111

The SNCT 15 is reported to be used in 80% of National Health Service acute

112

hospitals in England.5 The tool was originally designed to determine the required

113

number of staff to employ (the establishment) for each unit unit to ensure that there

114

are sufficient staff to fill daily rosters to meet average need, but it is increasingly used

115

to monitor and determine daily demand for staff. It is an example of a patient

116

classification system.4 Patients are classified into one of five groups, based on their

117

acuity and dependency on nursing care, with each group having an associated

118

weighting (described as a ‘multiplier’) indicating the number of nursing staff

119

required.15 At the time of writing, the most recently published multipliers for general

120

adult inpatient units were based on observations of 40,000 patient care episodes.6

121

The multipliers represent the average of staff time to provide all direct patient care

122

and ancillary work for patients in each group with allowances made for annual leave,

123

study time and sickness absence when determining the number of nurses to employ.

124

15

125

The SNCT has been shown to correlate strongly with an alternative classification

126

system and high inter-rater agreement is reported. 16, 17 However, while the tool’s

127

handbook recommends a sample of at least 20 days to establish a reliable baseline

128

for setting establishments, we could find no evidence of the precision of the resulting

129

estimates. In our review of literature, we found no direct evidence that using this or

130

any other tool improved the quality of care. 4

131

This observational study aims to provide evidence about the reliability and validity of

132

the SNCT by addressing the precision of the estimated establishment and the extent

133

to which staffing shortfalls relative to the level implied by the tool is associated with

134

nurses’ judgement that staffing levels are insufficient to sufficient to deliver all

135

necessary care with acceptable quality. Because factors such as patient turnover,

136

specialty and layout are not directly considered in patient classifications yet may

137

influence staffing requirements 18-20, we also examine the extent to which staffing

138

levels determined using the SNCT are sufficient to accommodate variation in

139

demand associated with these factors by determining whether there is an

140

independent association between these factors and judgements of staffing adequacy

141

when considering the effect of shortfalls from the SNCT recommended staffing level.

142

Methods and materials

143

We used routinely collected data and and nurse reports over one year (2017) from

144

81 acute medical/surgical units (2178 beds) in four NHS hospital trusts (hereafter

145

referred to as hospitals for brevity) in England. For each unit and for each day we

146

identified staffing measurements: the staffing level deployed (from the electronic

147

roster), the staffing level required (based on patient classifications using the SNCT),

148

and nurses’ professional judgement of the completeness of care and adequacy of

149

staffing to deliver quality (through a micro survey embedded in the daily

150

assessments). SNCT and staffing adequacy assessments were provided by the

151

nurse in charge of the shift, hereafter referred to as ‘shift leader’ for brevity.

152

Setting & inclusion

153

The study sites were one university teaching hospital, two general hospitals and a

154

specialist cancer hospital (two sites) based in London, South East and South West

155

England. The hospitals serve diverse populations including rural areas, deprived

156

inner city populations and specialist national referrals. All hospitals undertook

157

reviews of nurse staffing establishments at least twice a year. Two had been using

158

the SNCT as part of this process for some time while two adopted it shortly before

159

the study commenced.

160

We included general medical and surgical units that provided 24 hour inpatient care.

161

Services out of scope of the SNCT (e.g. paediatrics, intensive care, maternity,

162

neonatal and palliative care), and any others with highly atypical staffing

163

requirements (e.g. bone marrow transplant and isolation units), as determined by a

164

local co-investigator, were excluded. Our unit sample represented 74% of all beds

165

across the four hospitals.

166

Data sources and measures

167

Over the course of one year at least twice per day, shift leaders recorded the number

168

of patients in each SNCT category and made judgements about staffing adequacy

169

(see below) in electronic systems. Local leads trained potential shift leaders on

170

participating units in the use of the SNCT and completion of the staffing adequacy

171

questions. Supporting information and brief guidance was provided on laminated

172

sheets kept near the unit computers where data were entered. Other data for the

173

study were routinely collected for administrative purposes (roster, patient admissions

174

or discharges). Each hospital supplied a profile for each unit with main speciality and

175

layout including the number of beds / single rooms.

176

Study variables

177

We used the most up-to-date SNCT multipliers available at the start of the study.15

178

We took the reported counts of patients in each category and calculated the

179

weighted average multiplier per unit and day. We multiplied this by the patient count

180

derived from the patient administration system, in case any patients were omitted

181

from shift leader reports. This figure provides an estimate of the required unit

182

establishment (number of staff to employ). We used morning assessments and

183

patient count at 7am for our main analysis. To determine the implied daily hours, we

184

used a 37.5 hour working week for 1 whole time equivalent, removing the 22%

185

‘uplift’, which is added to the SNCT establishment to account holidays, study and

186

sick leave.

187

For each unit we used the average observed skill mix on that unit as a proxy for the

188

planned skill mix of registered nurses and nursing assistants. The SNCT does not

189

directly account for patients identified as requiring 1 to 1 supervision, often referred

190

to as ‘specialing’ 21 even though the implied staffing requirement is very high.

191

Therefore, where we wanted to identify the staffing requirements for any particular

192

day, we identified the number of such patients from records and added the required

193

hours to our estimated staffing requirement. However, because such enhanced care

194

would form part of the care observed to determine the SNCT multipliers and thus be

195

included in the average, we made no additional allowance when estimating

196

establishments to be employed.

197

From the electronic roster we identified hours worked by registered nurses and

198

nursing assistants each day (from 7am to 7am) and divided these by the number of

199

patient days (patient hours / 24) to calculate hours per patient day (HPPD) for each

200

unit for each day. We calculated a measure of staff shortfall, by subtracting the

201

required hours (according to the SNCT plus specialing requirements) from the hours

202

actually deployed on that day. If more staff than the estimated requirement were

203

deployed, the shortfall was negative. We also calculated daily patient turnover per

204

staff member (the numbers of patients entering and leaving units divided by the total

205

staff hours).

206

The outcomes measured were a number of variables reflecting the adequacy of

207

nurse staffing, as reported by the nurse in charge of the shift (‘shift leader’). The shift

208

leader responded to three brief items every time they provided SNCT ratings, directly

209

inputting responses into the same system as used for SNCT (see Table 1). Two

210

items, based on the widely used RN4CAST / International Hospital Outcomes

211

surveys of nurse staffing and quality, asked whether there were enough staff for

212

quality and whether any necessary care was left undone. 12, 22 We also asked about

213

staff missing breaks, as nurses may miss breaks to complete care activities, creating

214

additional staff time that avoids adverse effects of staffing shortfalls.23 These

215

questions constituted the micro-survey.

216

Table 1 Staffing adequacy questions
Questions
Were there enough nursing staff to provide quality care on the last shift?
Was necessary nursing care left undone (missed) on the last shift because there were too few

218

Data cleaning and Analysis

219

Data cleaning, processing and statistical analyses were carried out in R statistical

220

software V3.5.0.24 We identified and removed extreme values of staffing shortfall,

221

where values lay outside the mean plus or minus three standard deviations

222

(approximately 1.5% of cases). This removed atypical periods if the unit was not

223

functioning as normal, e.g. over the Christmas period, or where there is an extreme

224

error in the recorded SNCT ratings. Where there were major changes such as unit

225

moves, changes to the patient population or bed numbers, data for that unit were

226

split and treated as separate units. We found some evidence of consistent reverse

227

coding of data inputs (0/1 for yes/no) for some staffing adequacy questions in

228

several units of one hospital. This appeared to result from erroneous staff training.

229

Because it was discovered partway through the study we developed logical rules to

230

identify units where this occurred and recode data, considering the implications of

231

this through sensitivity analyses where we excluded the hospital entirely.

232

To understand the accuracy of the estimated establishment we first considered the

233

minimum recommended sample size of the SNCT data collection, which is 20 days

234

twice a year. We used 1000 bootstrap samples of 20 days’ data to estimate a mean

235

establishment with a 95% confidence interval for the establishment on each unit. We

236

repeated this with bootstrap samples of increasing numbers of days to assess the

237

accuracy of larger samples. For each unit, we calculated both the precision of the

238

estimate, that is half the width of the confidence interval expressed as a % of the

239

mean, and the absolute value of the confidence interval in whole time equivalent

240

(WTE) staff members. We determined the number of units where the confidence

241

interval of the establishment was 2 WTE or less (that is no more than +/-1 WTE

242

difference from the mean) or 1 WTE or less (mean +/- .5).

243

We modelled the relationship between staffing deficits (in HPPD) and nurse-reported

244

measures of staffing adequacy. We fitted multilevel logistic regression models for

245

binary outcomes using the glmer (generalised linear mixed effects regression)

246

function from the lme4 package 25 in R. Staffing was nested in unit which was nested

247

in hospital. All models included control for day of the week, proportion of single

248

rooms, turnover and unit specialty (surgical vs medical or mixed ). We considered

249

the association of staffing adequacy outcomes with deviation of both registered

250

nurse staffing and nursing assistant staffing from their estimated requirements. We

251

also fitted models using the deviation in total hours and skill mix (registered nurse

252

proportion).

253

After modelling the linear and main effects, we introduced quadratic terms for the

254

staffing level variables to assess non-linear relationships and we investigated

255

whether staffing variables interacted with other variables. We compared the fit of

256

models using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC, BIC), preferring

257

models with lower values, indicating better fit / more parsimonious models.26

258

Ethical approval and registration

259

Ethical approval was granted by the University of Southampton Ethics committee

260

(reference 18809). The study was prospectively registered (ISRCTN 12307968).27

261

Results

262

We had useable SNCT ratings on 96% of occasions and responses to staffing

263

adequacy questions on 85% or more of possible occasions. After data cleaning and

264

linkage, we had 22,364 unit days where we could assess the association between

265

staffing shortfalls and perceptions of staffing adequacy.

266

Average unit staffing levels and skill mix varied considerably between hospitals and

267

between units within hospitals (Table 2). At a hospital level, average estimated

268

staffing requirements of units corresponded closely with the observed staffing levels

269

in 3 of 4 hospitals although all were somewhat understaffed relative to the estimated

270

requirement (8% or less). Larger differences between actual staffing and SNCT

271

estimates occurred on smaller, generally specialist, units with more single rooms

272

(where apparent overstaffing occurred), and some larger medical units (where

273

extremes of apparent understaffing occurred). In hospital C, a specialist hospital with

274

many small units, average unit staffing was 50% higher than the SNCT estimated

275

requirement.

Across all units, using the recommended minimum of 20 days’ data, the average

281

precision was 4.1% but varied by unit (range 0.6% - 13.5%). In absolute terms, the

282

average width of the 95% confidence intervals for the establishment was 2.9 whole

283

time equivalent staff (that is approximately mean +/- 1.5 WTE). The confidence

284

interval width was ≤2 WTE in 27/86 units and ≤1 WTE in only 3/86.

285

As the number of days sampled increases from 20 there was a marked increase in

286

precision (Figure 1), with most units (56/86) yielding a confidence interval width of ≤2

287

WTE from a sample of 40 days. The benefits of increased sample sizes diminishes

288

with larger samples however, and even with samples of 180 days only 53/77 units

289

gave a confidence interval width that was ≤1 WTE wide (Table 3).

1. Because units with establishment and / or specialty changes were treated as separate units for analysis, the total exceed the
number of units participating in the study. As the available data for some units was less than the sample required for the
estimate, the number of units for larger samples is reduced.
294

295

Across all units, a mean of 78% of shifts were assessed by the nurse in charge as

296

having enough staff to deliver quality care (unit mean range 24% to 96%). Necessary

297

nursing care was reported left undone because of too few staff on 5% of shifts

298

(range 0-25%) and breaks were reported missed on 5% of shifts (range 0-29%).

299

Shortfalls in staffing levels relative to the requirement for that day, estimated using

300

the SNCT, were associated with nurses’ perceptions of staffing adequacy (Table 4).

301

In the multivariable models, for each registered nurse hour shortfall, the adjusted

302

odds of the shift leader reporting that there were enough staff for quality were 11%

303

lower, the odds of reporting nursing care left undone were increased by 14%, and

304

the odds of staff missing breaks were increased by 12%. Findings are similar for

305

shortfalls of nursing assistants.

306

Factors other than shortfalls relative to the SNCT estimated requirement were also

307

associated with perceptions of staffing adequacy. Nurses on surgical units were less

308

likely to perceive adequate staffing compared to nurses on other (medical or mixed)

309

units. For example, the odds of nurses reporting that there were enough staff for

quality were 44% lower on surgical units. Although relationships were not always

311

significant and confidence intervals were wide, the odds of reporting enough staff for

312

quality were substantially lower on units with a higher proportion of single rooms.

313

Similarly, odds of reporting care left undone and missed breaks were substantially

314

increased on units with a higher proportion of single rooms and units with higher

315

turnover, although again confidence intervals were wide and relationships were not

316

all statistically significant. Nurses were more likely to report that there were enough

317

staff for quality and less likely to report missed care and missed breaks on Saturday

318

compared to Monday, although there was no consistent pattern that suggested

319

weekends differed from weekdays.

324

We tested for non-linear relationships with registered nurse and nursing assistant

325

shortfalls, as would be expected if the SNCT provides a threshold for adequate

326

staffing. We estimated models using effects that were significant in the main effects

327

models, adding a variable for staffing shortfall squared for each staff group. For

328

nursing care left undone, the non-linear term for registered nurse staffing was

329

significant but there was no clear indication that the model was preferable (AIC Δ-2,

330

BIC Δ +14 ) and the overall relationship was not changed substantially. No indication

331

of a threshold where benefit / harm starts could be observed (see FIG 2). Other non-

332

linear terms were not significant and associated with increased AIC & BIC (S1 Table

333

5).

337

We estimated models that included all statistically significant variables and

338

interactions between staffing and these variables. There were no significant

339

interaction effects between registered nurse shortfall and nursing assistant shortfall

340

and both AIC and BIC increased for these models (S1 Table 6), so the simpler

341

models were preferred.

342

Models using overall care hours (registered nurse and assistants) per patient day

343

gave similar coefficients, with each care hour per patient day of shortfall associated

344

with a 12% reduction in the odds of reporting enough staff for quality and no

345

significant associations with skill mix (S1 Table 7). Because of the coding errors

346

noted from units in one of the hospitals, we repeated the main models omitting data

347

from this hospital. Results were largely unchanged with no effect on substantive

348

conclusions (see S1 Table 8 for an example).

Discussion

350

This study reports the first independent assessment of the SNCT, which is widely

351

used to determine staffing levels in English hospitals. Using the recommended

352

minimum 20 day sample, estimates for the number of nurses that should be

353

employed on a ward had an average precision of 4.2%, with wide confidence

354

intervals for the absolute staff numbers needed. A sample of 40 days gave an

355

estimate within +/- 1 staff members for the majority of wards but much larger

356

samples (100 days or more) are required to estimate the staff required with a

357

confidence interval no more than 1 staff member wide in the majority of wards. When

358

staffing levels were lower relative to the required level estimated using the SNCT for

359

that day, staff were less likely to report that they had enough staff for quality, more

360

likely to report that necessary nursing care was omitted and staff breaks missed.

361

These relationships appeared to be linear, with no threshold when staffing reached

362

the SNCT recommended level. Other factors not included in the patient

363

classifications used by the SNCT, including presence of single bedded patient

364

rooms, patient turnover and unit speciality may also influence whether a given

365

staffing level is deemed to be sufficient by nurses working on the unit.

366

The original purpose of the SNCT was to ensure that units employed sufficient

367

nurses to be able to provide the care hours required by patients. Existing reports

368

attest to the inter-rater reliability of the tool 16, 17 but the recommendation that this

369

staffing establishment is estimated using at least 20 days of SNCT data recognises

370

that daily demand is variable and estimates based on small samples may be

371

imprecise. The average level of precision achieved from 20 days of observations in

372

our study appears, superficially, to be potentially acceptable. However, this masks

Performance of the Safer Nursing Care Tool

373

considerable variation in precision between units and large absolute differences in

374

terms of numbers of staff. Using a conventional (if technically slightly inaccurate)

375

interpretation of the confidence interval, this means that for many units, estimates

376

could vary from a true staffing requirement by more than 2 whole staff members. The

377

absolute importance of such differences may vary by unit, but the potential

378

significance of such inaccuracy is great.

379

Small increases in the number of days used to estimate establishments yield

380

substantial improvements in precision, although there are rapidly diminishing returns

381

from samples of more than 40 days. As more and more hospitals are gathering

382

SNCT ratings on a daily basis it may be that these data could be drawn on to review

383

establishments with the resource of periodic review invested instead into quality

384

control for the unit reports. Moving averages could be substituted for intermittent

385

review, with statistical process control methods used to determine when changes in

386

demand sufficient to revise the establishment have occurred 29.

387

For some units, variation is such that the estimated establishment may always be

388

imprecisely estimated and our results also highlight that unmeasured influences on

389

demand arising from factors such as unit layout and speciality may also have a

390

substantial systematic influence on the staffing requirements. In these cases, the use

391

of professional judgement, already emphasised within the guidance for the SNCT, is

392

paramount. In the face of an apparently objective measure, it is easy to prioritise the

393

measured quantity despite the substantial uncertainty associated with it. 30 It is clear

394

from both these results and the wider literature that professional judgement remains

395

an essential element in determining the required level of nurse staffing. 3, 4

Performance of the Safer Nursing Care Tool

396

Although our results about other influences on workload were imprecise, both

397

turnover and single rooms have been identified in other research as factors that

398

increase nursing workload,18-20, 31, 32 because of the specific work associated with

399

admissions and discharge, increases in indirect care requirements and, for single

400

rooms, the need for increased surveillance of potentially vulnerable patients. The

401

increased workload associated with turnover is acknowledged in the SNCT, where

402

revised multipliers are provided specific to acute admissions units, to reflect the high

403

patient turnover,15 Our findings could arise because variation in turnover within and

404

between general units is not be sufficiently accommodated within the average

405

demand across all patients. Our findings are consistent with surgical units having

406

higher workload for a given level of acuity / dependency, which may also result from

407

indirect care associated with surgery, such as arranging transports and providing

408

escorts.33 This is a novel finding, and where recommendations or mandates for

409

minimum staffing levels exist, medical units are not generally differentiated from

410

surgical units.34.

411

While there must be a balance between parsimony and accuracy in any tool, overall

412

our conclusion, based on these findings is that the current SNCT staffing

413

recommendations may fit some units better than others. Possible revisions to the

414

SNCT recommended staffing levels, represented by different “multipliers” for

415

different unit types and layouts, requires further investigation but the importance of

416

exercising professional judgments about other factors affecting workload is clear.

417

Although the SNCT multipliers were originally derived using professional expert

418

estimates of time required, subsequent developments have used empirical

419

observations to revise the multipliers.17 Our study is the first to show that staffing

Performance of the Safer Nursing Care Tool

420

shortfalls, relative to requirement estimated using the tool are associated with

421

professional judgements that staffing is insufficient to maintain quality care and other

422

indicators that staffing may be inadequate. However, if the SNCT were indicating a

423

level of staffing that was judged sufficient to meet all care needs with quality, the

424

relationship between shortfall and staffing adequacy would be expected to diminish

425

as staffing levels increase above the recommended level. Instead the relationships

426

we observed were essentially linear, with no evidence of a threshold above which

427

additional staffing had little effect on the likelihood that nurses would report that there

428

were enough staff. A recent study using the RAFAELA system, widely used in

429

Northern Europe, gave a similar finding. Staffing above the level defined as ‘optimal’

430

by the system was associated with decreases in mortality35, 36. A recent study found

431

that staffing below establishment as determined using the SNCT was associated

432

with an increased risk of death in hospital.11, 20 However, other results from this study

433

also showed a linear effect for registered nurse staffing with no threshold. So while

434

our findings are consistent with the SNCT providing a measure of demand, there is

435

no evidence to support the recommended staffing levels as optimal in any

436

meaningful sense.

437

The effects of registered nurse and nurse assistant shortfalls on perceptions of

438

staffing adequacy were similar but independent. However, the contribution of the two

439

groups is not equivalent nor are they interchangeable. A large body of research

440

points to the specific importance of maintaining a rich registered nurse skill mix for

441

patient safety. 37 More recent studies have shown the important contribution of both

442

registered nurses and assistants in maintaining both patient safety and the quality of

443

interpersonal care. 11, 38, 39 Simple substitutions are not feasible because the

444

contributions of each group are distinct and effective deployment of assistants is

445

likely to be contingent on having sufficient RNs to supervise and support them. 11, 38

446

The SNCT, while widely used in England is by no means the only staffing tool

447

available. Given the vast numbers of reports and different tools it is hard to say

448

definitively that there is no data that would allow comparison of the precision of the

449

SNCT with other tools for estimating staffing establishments, but our reviews found

450

no recent studies giving similar data about other tools. 3, 4 In this study we have

451

asked (and answered) a number of questions about the SNCT. These questions: the

452

precision with which establishments are estimated, the extent to which the averages

453

provided from a patient classification can accommodate variation from factors that

454

are unrelated to individual patients and whether the identified staffing level is in any

455

sense “optimal”, all need to be asked of other tools. Our recent reviews suggest such

456

questions are rarely asked of other tools and are even more rarely answered.

457

Limitations

458

Training was provided to unit nurses in using the SNCT but the extensive nature of

459

the study is such that the reliability of the ratings we used is likely to be less than that

460

achieved by expert raters in a dedicated review of establishments. However, the

461

wide variation in precision of estimates of unit establishments is unlikely to be

462

explained by this factor alone. Furthermore, the circumstances of our study resemble

463

routine use of the system when, as is now becoming common, assessments are

464

completed daily by shift leaders. We did find evidence of systematic coding errors for

465

the assessment of staffing adequacy on some units, although our substantive

466

conclusions were unaffected. However, this may indicate that less systematic errors

467

were also occurring. The effect of such errors would be to attenuate our ability to

468

estimate relationships and so we may be underestimating the relationship between

469

staffing shortfalls and perceptions of staffing adequacy. Our measures of staffing

470

adequacy relied on subjective reports by nurses, but these subjective assessments

471

have been shown to be associated with important patient outcomes 40-42. Our sample

472

was large but arose from only four hospitals so we cannot be sure that these results

473

would generalise across all hospitals.

474

Conclusions

475

The SNCT can provide a reliable estimate of a unit staffing establishment but larger

476

samples than the currently recommended minimum are required for most units to

477

provide estimates that are within 1 whole time equivalent staff member of the mean.

478

For some units, such precision is hard to obtain and there may be systematic

479

variations in staffing requirements associated with some unit types that are not

480

accounted for by the SNCT. While we recommend further exploration of the factors

481

affecting the reliability and validity of the SNCT estimates, and suggest that moving

482

averages instead of periodic reassessments could be used to identify when changes

483

in establishments are needed, our findings also firmly underpin the conclusion that

484

measurement is an adjunct to professional judgements, not a replacement for it. The

485

SNCT does appear to provide a measure of nursing workload but the recommended

486

staffing levels derived from it are not necessarily optimal.
