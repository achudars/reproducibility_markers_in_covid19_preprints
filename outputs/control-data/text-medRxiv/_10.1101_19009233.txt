ABSTRACT
Background and objectives
The aim of the current study was to establish the relative prevalences of Female Genital
Schistosomiasis (FGS) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We hypothesised that due to the
use of syndromic management for STIs it is possible that FGS is being misdiagnosed and
mismanaged as an STI. We therefore wanted to examine the relationship between FGS and the
individual STIs in schistosomiasis endemic areas.
Methods
Between 2011 and 2013, a cross-sectional study was performed in 32 randomly selected secondary
schools in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where each school had at least 300 pupils. In a
research clinic, FGS diagnosis, STI testing, and face-to-face interviews were performed in sexually
active, young women aged 16 – 22 years.
Results
FGS was the second most prevalent current genital infection (23%) . There were significantly more
women who had presented FGS among those who had detectable urinary schistosomiasis (35%),
compared to those without (19%, p< 0.001). In the FGS positive group 35% were positive for HPV
infection, compared to 24 % in the FGS negative group (p=0.010). In the FGS positive group 37%
were sero-positive for HSV infection, compared to 30% in the FGS negative group (p=0.079).
There were significantly fewer chlamydia infections amongst women with FGS (20%, p=0.018)
compared with those who did not have FGS (28%).
Conclusions
FGS was the second most common genital infection after HSV but the two were not significantly
associated. HPV infection was significantly associated with FGS. Surprisingly Chlamydia infection
were negatively associated with FGS. The results show the importance of the inclusion of FGS in
the management protocols for genital infections in areas endemic for urinary schistosomiasis, and
highlight the importance for more research on suitable differential diagnostic tools and disease
management.

Introduction
Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) was first described in 1899 in Egypt but was largely
only reported as incidental findings till the 1990s.1 It has been found to be almost as common as
urinary schistosomiasis within the female populations of endemic areas.2–4 Furthermore, in some
schistosomiasis endemic communities it may be the most common gynaecological morbidity.4
Despite its prevalence, World Health Organisation (WHO) data for 2017 shows that only 46.3% of
the 220.8 million people requiring treatment for schistosomiasis have been reached.5

Genital schistosomiasis is a poverty-related neglected tropical disease caused by the
Schistosoma haematobium parasite, which is transmitted by contact with infested water.4 It is
known to be endemic in areas of sub-Saharan Africa where lakes, rivers and dams are used for
domestic and recreational purposes.6 FGS may cause blood stained and foul smelling discharge,
dyspareunia, contact bleeding, burning sensations in the genitals, decreased fertility and
spontaneous abortions.7–10 The S. haematobium parasites inhabit blood vessels surrounding the
female genital tract and the urinary bladder.4 There they lay eggs, which then migrate towards the
adjacent organs, creating the afore mentioned morbidities.4 The morbidity seen in FGS is attributed
to chronic inflammation in the cervical and vaginal mucosa and lesions involve both dead and
viable parasite eggs.11

FGS is a differential diagnosis to some STIs, causing vaginal discharge and ulcers.12
Furthermore, it has also been hypothesised that FGS may make females susceptible to Human
papillomavirus infection and other sexually transmitted diseases.13,14

In this study, we aim to explore the relationship between FGS and reproductive tract
infections in an adolescent female population and establish the relative prevalences of these
infections in a rural S. haematobium endemic area.

Methods
Study Design
It has been shown that the schistosomiasis problem is in the lower altitudes KwaZulu-Natal
Province of South Africa.15 Therefore, secondary schools below the altitude of 400 meters were
invited to take part in the study. Nested in a prospective study on the prevention of FGS, the study
included schools with a urinary schistosomiasis prevalence above 20%.16,17 For practical purposes
and due to financial constraints, we only invited schools with three hundred or more pupils. Schools
were excluded if they had been classified as urban (and therefore less likely to be using infested
water sources) by the Department of Education. From 2011 to 2013 we included sexually active
school attending adolescent women aged 16-22 years, usually in grades 10-12, who consented to a
gynaecological examination, and were willing to be tested for STIs.17
Clinical Examination and Questionnaire
Trained female staff interviewed study participants in isiZulu (the local language) using a
questionnaire that covered demographic information, current reproductive health complaints,
obstetric history, sexual behaviour, water contact and their approaches to the health services for
genital symptoms. Participants then underwent a gynaecological examination performed by female
doctors trained in recognising FGS. Clinical signs of FGS were documented by photo-colposcopy
(Olympus OCS 500 colposcope with a mounted Olympus E 420 10 megapixel (Mpx) single lens
reflex (SLR) device, or a Leisegang colposcope with a Canon EOS 40D 10 Mpx SLR).18 Grainy
sandy patches were defined as lesions with grains measuring approximately 0.05 x 0.2 mm and
shaped like minuscule rice grains, deeply or superficially situated within the mucosa.12,19
Homogenous yellow patches were defined as yellow areas with no distinct grains. Rubbery papules
were defined as beige to yellow papules with a firm (rubbery) protrusion into the lumen. All the
FGS lesions may be accompanied by characteristic abnormal blood vessels.

Laboratory testing
For the diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis, a urine sample was collected between 10 a.m. and 2
p.m. which is the peak daily egg excretion time.20 Urine was centrifuged, the sediment deposited on
two slides and read by two independent laboratory technicians.
Biopsies were not taken because the post-biopsy lesion may pose an unnecessary raised risk of HIV
transmission in this HIV endemic area.21 Urine was considered schistosomiasis positive if at least
one S. haematobium ovum was seen under the microscopy. Samples of cervicovaginal lavage
(CVL) was collected by spraying 10 mL of saline on the cervical surface and withdrawing it back
into the syringe. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibodies were detected in serum using
ELISA Ridascreen HSV-2 IgG, (Davies Diagnostics, Randburg South Africa) and in ELISA
HerpeSelect®, IgG assay, (Focus Diagnostics, Germany). Herpes simplex virus type 2 PCR was
only done in a subsample of participants due to financial and practical constraints. Likewise,
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) was done in a sub-sample, and detected by GP5+/6+ HPV PCR
followed by an enzyme immunoassay method using a cocktail mix HPV probes (Whitehead
Scientific South Africa).22 Cervical swabs were analysed using ProbeTec CT/GC and AC strand
displacement PCR assay for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea (Becton Dickinson,
Microbiology systems, United States).17,18 In-house PCR was used for the screening of
Trichomonas vaginalis and HSV, in the Laboratory of Infection, Prevention and Control at the
University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.23 Syphilis was detected in thawed serum
samples using Macro VueTM test 110/112 (BD, Becton Dickinson Microbiology systems, United
States) for a rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) and Immutrep for Treponema pallidum
haemagglutination assay (Omega diagnostics group PLC, Alva, Scotland, UK). Nugent’s scoring
criteria was used for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Candidiasis was diagnosed using the Gram
staining technique under light microscopy, and severity scored (one to five) in accordance to the
number of spores seen.24

Ethics
The study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Administration (BREC), University of
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Ref BF09/07) and the Department of Health, Pietermaritzburg,
South Africa (Ref HRKM010-08). Ethical clearance was also granted from the regional committee
of Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) South Eastern Norway (Ref 469-07066a1.2007.535)
and renewed in 2011. Specimens were collected after obtaining a written informed consent and each
young woman underwent recruitment procedures as described previously.17 For participants who
were 16-17 years of age, the ethics committee granted permission for independent minor consent
without parental consent. Permissions were also granted by the Departments of Health and
Education, KwaZulu-Natal.
Statistical Analysis
In order to be able to detect a 10% difference in an STI’s prevalence between the FGS positive and
negative groups with a confidence level of 0.05 and power of 0.8, sample size calculations indicated
that we would need 200 FGS positive patients and 600 FGS negative patients. Chi-Square or
Fisher’s exact tests were used to evaluate the hypothesis. Age was included in the multivariable
logistic regression regardless of significance level. Other variables were included if the association
between the sandy patches and the STIs had a p-value lower than 0.2. Comparison of mean age
between the FGS positive and negative groups was done using the Student’s T-test. Analyses were
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25 (Armonk, NY, US).

Results
A total of 933 participants from 32 schools were willing to be tested for STIs (Figure 1). One or
more STIs were found in 819/930 (88.1%) of the participants and FGS was found in 210/933
(22.5%). More than half of these rural secondary school going young women had been pregnant
(Table 1). The mean age was 18.7 years (Standard Deviation (SD) 1.6) indicating that
approximately half of them had missed a year or more of schooling. Most women had been exposed
to schistosomiasis risky water at some point in their lives 881/930 (94.7%). Urinary S.
haematobium ova excretion was found in 256/840 (30.5%). In the positive cases the geometric
mean intensity urinary S. haematobium was 57.9 eggs per 10 millilitres. There was no difference in
mean age of those who had FGS compared to those who did not. Evidence of a prior HSV infection
(serology) was found in 287/900 (31.8%) of the participants, and the prevalences of current
chlamydia, HPV and trichomoniasis were 218/827 (26.4%), 149/551 (27.0%) and 163/839 (19.4%)
respectively.

HPV testing was done in a subsample of 551 patients (55%) and was positively associated with
FGS. When HPV was analysed against the sub-types of sandy patches, it was positively associated
with superficial grainy sandy patches (Age Adj. OR 1.85, 95% CI (1.05 – 3.245) p = 0.03) and
homogenous sandy patches, (Adj. OR 2.43, 95% CI (1.49 – 4.0) p < 0.001). HPV was however, not
associated with deep grainy patches (Age Adj. OR 0.70, 95% CI (0.30 – 1.7) p = 0.42), but the
sample size was small (51 cases).

There was significantly less Chlamydia trachomatis in the FGS positive group than in the FGS
negative, after controlling for age, HSV serology and trichomoniasis. Chlamydia was also
negatively associated with superficial grainy sandy patches (Age Adj. OR 0.44, 95% CI (0.26 0.75) p = 0.002) and deep grainy patches (Adj. OR 0.30, 95% CI (0.12 - 0.77) p = 0.01).
Homogenous sandy patches showed the same tendency, (Adj. OR 0.71, 95% CI (0.42 -1.19) p =

0.19). Similarly, the chlamydia prevalence tended to be lower in the urinary schistosomiasis
positive cases than in urinary schistosomiasis negative, although this difference was not significant
(Adj. OR 0.70, 95% CI (0.45 - 1.02) p = 0.06). Half, 109/218 (50.0%) of the Chlamydia
trachomatis cases were clustered in 8/32 (25.0%) schools. After stratification, taking out the
chlamydia high-endemic schools, FGS remained negatively associated with chlamydia, after
adjusting for age, trichomoniasis and HSV serology, (Adjusted Odds Ratio (Adj. OR) 0.41, 95% CI
(0.22 – 0.79), p = 0.007) but not in the eight schools, each of which had more than 35% chlamydia.
Of the study participants 12.6% (110/876) had been treated for a sexually transmitted infection
previously, there was a significant association with having HSV (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9, p=0.001)
but no association was found with FGS (p=0.97), chlamydia (p=0.33), dual infection with FGS and
chlamydia (0.45) or other STIs.

Trichomonas vaginalis was associated with the clinical finding of “homogenous sandy patches”
(Age Adj. OR 1.74, 95% CI (1.10 - 2.75) p= 0.019). No other STIs were associated with grainy
sandy patches (data not shown). Positive HSV serology and current trichomoniasis were higher in
the FGS positive group than in the FGS negative but the differences were not significant. The mean
bacterial vaginosis scores were the same in FGS positive and negative populations. Only, 29/901
(3.2%) cases were positive for Treponema pallidum and there was no significant difference between
the groups (p =0.49).

HSV PCR (indication current shedding) was done in a subsample and only 12/351 individuals were
positive. There was no significant difference in HSV shedding in FGS positive participants
compared to negative cases (OR 0.95, 95% CI (0.33 - 2.76), p=0.92).

As expected, FGS was positively associated with urinary schistosomiasis (OR 2.32, 95% CI (1.773.02), p < 0.001). FGS was found in 89/256 (34.8%) of those who were positive for urinary

schistosomiasis but also in 110/584 (18.8%) of the participants where urinary schistosomiasis was
not detected (only one urine sample, for each participant examined). Amongst the five participants
who denied any waterbody contact, none were diagnosed with urinary schistosomiasis although
sandy patches were found in one case. Urinary schistosomiasis was not associated with any of the
other reproductive tract infections.

As further exploration, we included HPV in the multivariable analysis of Table 2. HPV remained
significantly associated with FGS (Adj. OR 1.71, 95% CI (1.11 – 2.38), p = 0.016). However, there
was less chlamydia in the FGS positive than in the FGS negative but the difference was not
statistically significant (Adj. OR 0.67, 95% CI (0.42 – 1.07) p = 0.096).

Discussion
Female Genital Schistosomiasis was almost as common as chlamydia, with both infections affecting
more than one fifth of this young rural population. Unexpectedly, the FGS positive had less
concurrent chlamydia infection, compared to those without FGS. This has not been reported
previously. As published previously, the study shows that FGS seems to be a risk factor for HPV.

FGS manifestations cause a chronic state of intravaginal inflammation which could hypothetically
aid the acquisition of HPV and other STIs.11,25 The S. haematobium transmission and manifestations
as FGS are likely to have occurred in early childhood and therefore prior to sexually transmitted
infections.10,26 Previous studies indicate that there are intravaginal damages already from a young
age. If the vaginal discharge has been constant since childhood, it could be argued that it would be
interpreted as normal by the patients.10,26 However, one study found that adults with FGS reported
having abnormal discharge.27 This may indicate that they have experienced changes in discharge,
possibly because the bleeding and ulcerous surfaces of FGS are super-infected by other agents such
as bacteria, as has been found for S. haematobium of the bladder in mouse models.28

There was an overall trend of higher prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in the FGS
positive participants. However, chlamydia was the exception. It could be hypothesised that FGS
somehow protects women from chlamydia. However, could be hypothesised that young women
with FGS and chlamydia sought STI treatment provided freely by the local clinics, possibly due to
intensified symptoms with dual infection.29 This could not be confirmed in our study.

In order to detect small differences between the groups, we would have had to have a larger sample
size. Almost all participants in this population had water contact at some point in their lives. Due to
logistic and resource constraints, only one urine sample was collected per participant. Multiple
samples would likely have yielded a higher prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis due to day to day

variation in egg excretion.30 This was a limitation in this study. Furthermore, FGS diagnosis is
dependent on the subjective inspection of all intra-vaginal surfaces, including the fornices and
posterior and anterior vaginal walls.12,19 Therefore we may have also have missed some FGS
positive cases. As is often the case in schistosomiasis research, this might have obscured differences
between the FGS positive and FGS negative groups.3

In rural South Africa, abnormal discharge and genital ulcers are currently managed syndromically
as STIs, without laboratory testing.31 The symptoms of FGS overlap with symptoms of the various
STIs causing discharge, a burning sensation in the genitals and ulcers.10,27 However, in countries
where FGS is endemic, laboratory testing for STIs and examinations are often not performed. The
current syndromic management for vaginal discharge entails treatment for chlamydia, gonorrhoea
and trichomoniasis, but not for FGS.31 Therefore, patients may be inadvertently over-treated for the
STIs and undertreated/not treated for FGS.

Examinations for FGS rely on clinical expertise, and are not yet performed in rural healthcare.12,25
The risk of misdiagnosis of FGS as an STI warrants rewriting the syndromic management protocols
and algorithms for genital tract disease, especially in endemic areas. Furthermore, symptoms of
STIs and FGS are also found in children with Schistosoma haematobium.10 Yet health professionals
are not taught about FGS, and FGS is not on the list of differential diagnoses for genital ulcers and
discharge. Therefore changes in the health professionals’ curricula and the protocols for
management of reproductive tract diseases in females are necessary.21,32 Anti-schistosomal
treatment should be added to the treatment protocols and FGS should be considered amongst the
differential diagnoses.

Preventive treatment for S. haematobium with praziquantel is not expensive and readily available
and may provide a reduction in FGS occurrence. Further research is needed to understand the
