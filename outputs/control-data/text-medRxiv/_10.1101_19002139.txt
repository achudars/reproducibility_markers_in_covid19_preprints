Abstract

41

Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects 2-3% of the population over the age of 65 with loss of

42

dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra impacting the functioning of basal ganglia-

43

thalamocortical circuits. The precise role played by the thalamus is unknown, despite its

44

critical role in the functioning of the cerebral cortex, and the abnormal neuronal activity of

45

the structure in PD. Our objective was to more clearly elucidate how functional connectivity

46

and morphology of the thalamus are impacted in PD (n = 32) compared to Controls (n = 20).

47

To investigate functional connectivity of the thalamus we subdivided the structure into two

48

important regions-of-interest, the first with putative connections to the motor cortices and the

49

second with putative connections to prefrontal cortices. We then investigated potential

50

differences in the size and shape of the thalamus in PD, and how morphology and functional

51

connectivity relate to clinical variables. Our data demonstrate that PD is associated with

52

increases in functional connectivity between motor subdivisions of the thalamus and the

53

supplementary motor area, and between prefrontal thalamic subdivisions and nuclei of the

54

basal ganglia, anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, as well as the anterior and

55

paracingulate gyri. These results suggest that PD is associated with increased functional

56

connectivity of subdivisions of the thalamus which may be indicative alterations to basal

57

ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry.

Introduction

65

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the

66

world, affecting 2-3% of the population over the age of 65 [1]. Characteristic motor

67

symptoms of the disorder include resting tremor, rigidity and postural instability. These are

68

accompanied by non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment, autonomic

69

dysfunction, disorders of sleep-wake cycle regulation, sensory disturbances and pain [2]. The

70

neuropathological hallmark of PD is the presence of α-synuclein-immunopositive Lewy

71

bodies and neurites [3]. This neuropathology results in a degeneration of nigrostriatal

72

dopaminergic neurons, depletion of dopamine across the striatum [4] and consequent

73

dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamocortical networks [5, 6]. α-synuclein is thought to spread

74

from brainstem regions along the neuraxis, impacting areas of the neocortex at advanced

75

stages of the disease [7]. Dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits is thus critical

76

as these circuits work in concert with the cortex to mediate a range of cognitive, motor and

77

limbic functions in the brain [8].

78
79

To understand the functioning of a network, it is necessary to study the elements of the

80

network and also their interconnections [9]. Investigating elements of brain networks can be

81

done via studying the morphology of key neuroanatomical nuclei acting as ‘hubs’ within

82

these networks [10]. Hubs are nodes within brain networks that make strong contributions to

83

global network function [11] and the interconnections between these hubs can be investigated

84

through the use of resting-state functional connectivity MRI methods that measure the

85

functioning of intrinsic connectivity networks in the brain at rest [12]. Spontaneous

86

fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal that are temporally coherent

87

indicate areas in the brain that may be functionally and anatomically related [13].

89

As dopamine replacement therapies provide some relief of motor symptoms in PD,

90

significant research effort has focused on the role played by dopaminergic-depleted nuclei of

91

the striatum [14]. However, there is now considerable evidence that the pathology underlying

92

PD affects certain nuclei in the thalamus, and that the structure plays an important role in PD

93

as loss of dopaminergic input to the striatum results in increased GABA-mediated inhibition

94

of thalamocortical projections [15]. The thalamus, considered an integrative hub within

95

functional brain networks [16], is thus an important neuroanatomical structure which we can

96

use to investigate how basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are affected in PD, potentially

97

revealing important information about the pathophysiology of the disease.

98
99

Functional connectivity (FC) studies implicating the thalamus have yielded inconsistent

100

results with research demonstrating both increased coupling between the thalamus and

101

sensorimotor regions in PD [17] and no significant differences in thalamic FC in PD [18].

102

Studies have indicated that PD is associated with thalamic volumetric changes compared to

103

control groups [19, 20], while other work presents conflicting data [21-27]. Research has

104

demonstrated subtle morphological changes in a PD cohort compared to controls [19, 23]

105

while other research has found no significant localized shape changes [21, 24, 26]. Although

106

the thalamus plays a key modulatory role in the brain, there is a lack of evidence for a

107

relationship between thalamus volumes and clinical function [21, 22, 27, 28]. Further, there is

108

still significant information to be derived about the precise contribution of component nuclei

109

of the structure, which are impacted differently by the pathological changes that take place in

110

PD. We thus aimed to investigate the FC of relevant functional subdivisions within the

111

thalamus that are crucial in mediating cognitive and motor function. We then sought to

112

investigate possible localized structural changes to the thalamus using a morphological

113

surface-based and volumetric analyses.

114
115

We hypothesized that there would be morphological alterations to the thalamus in PD based

116

on the potential impact of PD neuropathology, which has been shown to display

117

neurodegeneration post-mortem [29]. We also hypothesized that there would be a correlation

118

between smaller overall volumes of the thalamus and poorer performance on measures of

119

motor and cognitive function. Finally, we hypothesized that FC of important motor and

120

prefrontal subdivisions of the thalamus would be impacted in PD due to the effect of PD

121

disease processes on basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits.

Materials and methods

124

Participants

125

Participants in this research were members of the Swedish BioFINDER Study

126

(www.biofinder.se). The study is based in Sweden and is affiliated with the Clinical Memory

127

Research Unit and The Biomedical Centre, both at Lund University. Participants were

128

recruited from the Memory and neurology clinics at Skåne University Hospital as well as the

129

Memory Clinic at Ängelholm Hospital. Participants gave written informed consent and this

130

research was performed in accordance with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of

131

Helsinki. Participants in the current study received their clinical assessments between

132

23/05/2012 and 13/03/2014. Ethical approval was obtained through the Ethical Review Board

133

of Lund, Sweden, and the Human Research Ethics Committee at the Australian National

134

University, Canberra, Australia. Diagnosis of PD (n = 32) was made by a neurologist using

135

the National Institute of Neurological and Stroke Diagnostic criteria [30]. A healthy control

136

group (Controls) (n = 20) was used for comparison. Exclusion criteria for the Swedish

137

BioFINDER study included poor knowledge of the Swedish language, developmental

138

disability, psychiatric disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, the presence of a metabolic

139

disorder, diagnosis of probable PD dementia [31]. A preliminary investigation of functional

140

MRI data indicated a significant difference in subject head motion during image acquisition.

141

We therefore implemented a strict study-specific head motion exclusion criterion of >

142

0.26mm (defined as mean relative displacement) and used advanced denoising procedures

143

(FSL-FIX) as nuisance regression can be insufficient in removing the spurious effects of

144

movement artifacts in MRI data [32].

145
146

All participants underwent a cognitive and neurological examination by a medical doctor

147

with extensive experience in movement disorders. PD patients remained on medication as per

148

their usual regime for both MRI acquisition and clinical assessment, with a levodopa

149

equivalent dosage (LED) metric recorded for each participant. Functioning of participants

150

was quantified with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part-III test (UPDRS-III),

151

assessing the motor signs of PD [33], the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), assessing

152

cognitive mental state [34], the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), assessing mobility [35], the A

153

Quick Test of Cognitive Speed test assessing perception and cognitive speed (AQT) [36] and

154

the Animal Fluency test (AF), assessing verbal fluency and executive function [37].

MRI acquisition

157

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3T scanner (Trio, Siemens Magnetom,

158

Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 20-channel head-coil. High-resolution T1-weighted

159

three-dimensional anatomical brain images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared

160

rapid acquisition technique with gradient-echo sequence (repetition time = 7 ms; echo time =

161

3 ms; flip angle = 90 degrees; voxel size = isotropic 1=mm3). Image matrix size was 356

162

voxels in the coronal and sagittal planes and 176 voxels in the axial plane. Resting state

163

functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) (256 volumes per subject) were acquired

164

using T2*-weighted echo planar imaging volumes (repetition time = 1850 ms; echo time 30

165

ms; flip angle = 90 degrees; matrix 64 × 64; voxel size 3 × 3 × 3.75 mm3). Image matrix size

166

was 64 voxels in the coronal and sagittal planes and 36 voxels in the axial plane. Subjects

167

were instructed to lie still with their eyes closed, not to fall asleep and not to think of

168

anything in particular during the scan, which lasted for approximately 8 minutes.

169
170

Manual segmentation of the thalamus

171

Manual region-of-interest tracing was performed on participant’s T1 MRI data, using

172

ANALYZE 12.0 software (Mayo Biomedical Imaging Resource, Rochester, Minnesota,

173

USA) following a validated method [38]. The tracing for each thalamus was saved as a

174

binary image for rs-fMRI seed-based FC and shape-based morphological analyses. A detailed

175

explanation of the manual tracing method and associated reliability statistics is available in

176

Supplementary Information ‘Manual segmentation of the thalamus.’

177
178

Resting-state fMRI preprocessing

179

All rs-fMRI preprocessing used FMRIB Software Library (FSL) software package tools

180

(FMRIB Software Library, Oxford, UK; FSL version 5.0.10, RRID:SCR_002823) [39].

181

FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT) (version 6.00) was used for the removal of the first 6

182

volumes, motion correction using FMRIB Motion Correction Linear Registration Tool

183

(MCFLIRT) [40], slice-timing correction using Fourier-space timeseries phase-shifting,

184

removal of non-brain structures using FSL’s Brain Extraction Tool (BET) [41], spatial

185

smoothing using a full-width half-maximum gaussian kernel of 5 mm, grand mean intensity

188

images used boundary-based registration [43] within the FMRIB Linear Registration Tool

189

(FLIRT) [40, 44]. Registration of functional images to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)

190

152 T1 2mm3 standard space was also performed using FLIRT with 12 degrees of freedom,

191

further refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration [45, 46] with a warp resolution of 10mm

192

and a resampling resolution of 4mm. Denoising of head motion, scanner and cerebrospinal

193

fluid artefacts was performed using a probabilistic Multivariate Exploratory Linear

194

Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC version 3.15)

195

independent component analysis method [47]. FSL’s ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX version

196

1.06) [48] was then used to classify components as either signal or noise, with noise

197

components and also motion confounds (24 regressors) regressed from the data. For the full

198

explanation of the denoising procedure see Supplementary Information ‘Independent

199

component analysis denoising.’

200
201

The Oxford Thalamic Structural Connectivity Probability Atlas [49] within FSL’s

202

visualization GUI FSLeyes was used to parcellate bilateral thalamic manual segmentation

203

masks into two seed regions-of-interest masks (seed-ROIs) (Fig 1), representing important

204

functional subdivisions of the thalamus. Due to the cardinal motor symptoms in PD, our first

205

seed-ROI incorporated voxels with the highest probability of connectivity with pre- and

206

primary motor cortices and are intended to represent the ventral lateral posterior, ventral

207

lateral and ventral anterior thalamic nuclei. Due to the significant cognitive dysfunction

208

observed in PD, our second seed-ROI incorporated voxels with the highest probability of

209

connectivity to the prefrontal cortex, intended to represent the mediodorsal and anterior

210

thalamic nuclei [49]. For ease of reference we will refer to these seed-ROIs as the VLp/VA

211

thalamus and MD/A thalamus, respectively. Generic VLp/VA and MD/A thalamic masks

212

were thresholded to only include voxels that had a greater than 50% chance of inclusion, then

213

registered to subject-specific functional MRI space, and finally eroded by zeroing non-zero

214

voxels when found in kernel, to reduce partial volume effects. A visual inspection of a subset

215

of VLp/VA and MD/A masks was then performed to check the alignment of masks within

216

functional data. We then extracted the mean activation of the functional data within the two

217

seed-ROI masks at each functional timepoint for use as explanatory variables at the

218

individual-level general linear model (GLM) stage in a mass univariate voxelwise whole-

219

brain analysis. The average number of voxels per seed-ROI for each group and a pairwise

220

comparison of this data is shown in Supplementary Information ‘Atlas-based ROI

Resting-state fMRI statistical analyses

235

Two individual-level FC analyses were performed for each participant, using a GLM

236

approach [50]. BOLD timeseries data within the VLp/VA and MD/A thalamus were

237

correlated with activity in the rest of the brain, shifting the model with a temporal derivative

238

to account for lags in the onset of the hemodynamic response function, removing volumes

239

corrupted by large motion and regressing out average timeseries data from whole brain

240

(global signal regression), white matter and ventricle masks. For the full explanation of our

241

approach to individual-level GLM analyses, see Supplementary Information ‘Individual-level

243

and Control subjects were investigated in standard space using FSL-FEAT. We chose a

244

nonparametric permutation-based approach (n = 5000) [51] via FSL-randomise [52] with a

245

threshold-free cluster enhancement method controlling the family-wise error rate at p < 0.05.

246

This approach avoids selecting arbitrary threshold values, while also potentially improving

247

sensitivity to test signal shapes and SNR values [53]. Due to there being a significant

248

difference in education between PD and Control groups, we included years of education as a

249

covariate, along with age and sex.

250
251

Correlation between functional connectivity and clinical data

252

To investigate the relationship between FC and clinical variables we conducted a series of

253

post-hoc partial correlational analyses. These focused on the average parameter estimate for

254

VLp/VA and MD/A thalamus at the peak voxel locations derived from the between group

255

analyses. Spherical ROIs (7mm radius) were generated around the voxel locations with the

256

average parameter estimate extracted for each subject. Average FC for each ROI was then

257

correlated against LED, disease duration, UPDRS-III, TUG, AQT and Animal Fluency

258

scores.

Morphology of the thalamus in PD

261

Volumetric analyses

262

To investigate differences in volumes of the thalamus between PD and Controls we used

263

SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Somers, New York, USA) utilizing multivariate analysis of

264

covariance models controlling for estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV, derived from

265

recon-all FreeSurfer processing [54]), age and sex. Effect sizes are represented by partial eta

266

squared values (η2).

268

Surface based shape analysis

269

Shape analysis was performed using spherical harmonic parameterization and sampling in a

270

three-dimensional point distribution model (SPHARM-PDM) [55] outlined in detail in

271

Supplementary Information ‘SPHARM-PDM detail.’ Generally speaking, SPHARM-PDM

272

shape analysis provides visualizations of the local surface changes to the thalamus between

273

groups via mean difference displacement maps, mapping the magnitude of surface change

274

(deflation or inflation) in millimeters between corresponding points on the mean surfaces of

275

the PD subjects compared to Controls. Significant surface change was displayed at p < 0.05

276

with a correction for multiple comparisons performed using a false-discovery rate bound q of

277

5% [56].

278
279

Correlations between thalamic volumes and clinical symptoms

280

We used hierarchical multiple regression models to assess whether thalamic volumes can

281

predict clinical symptoms. These models incorporated two levels, the first level controlled for

282

eTIV, age, sex and years of education (the latter when dealing with measures of cognitive

283

function), and the second level held the independent variable of interest (volume of right or

284

left thalamus), measuring the unique contribution of that variable in predicting each measure

285

of clinical function. Effect sizes are represented by standardized beta values (β).

Discussion

374

The results of this study demonstrate that PD patients on medication have increased FC

375

within motor, dorsolateral and anterior cingulate basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. Our

376

data support the findings of a recent meta-analysis showing that PD patients have increased

377

FC of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuity [57], and extend these findings by showing how

378

important functional subterritories of the thalamus are impacted in PD. These changes in FC

379

were found despite any evidence of morphological alterations to the thalamus.

380
381

Our findings of increased FC between the VLp/VA thalamus and the supplementary motor

382

area may be indicative of changes within one segment of the classic ‘motor’ basal ganglia-

383

thalamocortical circuit [5]. In this model, the motor circuit originates at the supplementary

384

motor area, receiving input from the primary and the premotor cortices. These areas connect

385

with the nuclei of the basal ganglia, which project back to the ventral anterior and ventral

386

lateral nuclei of the thalamus, closing the loop by reconnecting with the site of origin in

387

motor cortical areas [5]. Increased FC between the putamen and the supplementary motor

388

area has been demonstrated previously [58] while other research using graph theoretical

389

analyses has demonstrated increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network

390

in PD [59]. Evidence suggests that increased FC of sensorimotor networks is likely related to

391

dopaminergic medication usage [60] potentially facilitating increases in FC, which is a

392

mechanism that will be discussed momentarily.

393
394

Our research also demonstrates significant and far more widespread increases in FC in PD

395

between the MD/A thalamus and the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, potentially

396

indicating a disease related change to the ‘dorsolateral prefrontal’ basal ganglia-

397

thalamocortical circuit [5]. This circuit originates in Brodmann areas 9 and 10 on the lateral

398

surface of the anterior frontal lobe, and after traversing the basal ganglia, connects directly

399

with our intended seed-ROIs at the anterior and mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus. From

400

there, the circuit projects back to the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to form a

401

closed loop [5]. Our findings of increased FC between the MD/A thalamus and the

402

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may represent functional compensatory mechanisms due to the

403

significant cognitive dysfunction common in PD. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex helps to

404

execute tasks that contribute to cognitive functioning, including working memory, decision-

405

making and action control, achieved through a top-down modulation of behavior in concert

406

with diverse cortical and subcortical structures [61]. Research has shown that FC is

407

significantly increased across the prefrontal cortex in PD subjects on medication, as the brain

408

potentially recruits new anatomical areas to aid in the performance of cognitive tasks. It is

409

argued that changes in FC may indicate a functional compensation to help restore cognitive

410

processes in PD [61]. Interestingly, we also found significant increases in FC between the

411

MD/A thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex in PD subjects, indicating a disease related

412

change to the ‘anterior cingulate’ basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit. In this circuit, the

413

anterior cingulate cortex links with the ventral basal ganglia structures, outputs to the ventral

414

anterior nuclei of the thalamus, and links back with the anterior cingulate cortex [5]. Our

415

findings of increased FC with the anterior as well as paracingulate gyri fit with the concept of

416

increased FC due to compensatory mechanisms, as this region of the brain interacts with the

417

lateral prefrontal cortex to mediate performance in tasks linked to cognitive processes [62].

418

Research has shown that a common response to neurological disruption is the hyper-

419

connectivity of brain circuits, which may reflect a protective mechanism in the brain to

420

maintain normal functioning [63]. Such a mechanism has been proposed in PD previously

421

[64, 65], as well as in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease [66, 67], and taken

422

together, our results provide support for this model.

423
424

There are nonetheless inconsistencies with similar FC research that require consideration.

425

Our data contrast with work demonstrating no significant FC changes between the thalamus

426

and widescale brain networks in subjects on medication [18]. A possible explanation for this

427

inconsistency may relate to how FC changes across different disease stages. When compared

428

to the current work, the study in question focused on PD subjects with both a longer disease

429

duration as well as a higher average Hoehn and Yahr stage [18]. This is important because

430

research has shown that FC in PD may undergo periods of both hyper-connectivity and hypo-

431

connectivity as the disease progresses [64]. Potential FC changes across the course of PD

432

thus make difficult to compare studies with subjects at different disease stages.

433
434

Our data also indicate that PD is associated with increases in FC between the MD/A thalamus

435

and the left dorsal caudate nuclei, anterior putamen and globus pallidus. Strong evidence

436

suggests that the output of the basal ganglia, mainly the globus pallidus interna, is

437

hyperactive in PD [68] and our results of increased FC with this area suggest that increased

438

activity may be accompanied by increased FC. Increased FC between the caudate nuclei and

439

the thalamus has been shown in a PD cohort on medication [69], however two studies have

440

demonstrated conflicting results [17, 70]. A crucial difference separating these studies relates

441

to patient inclusion. One of these studies focused on early PD patients with a mean disease

442

duration of 1.7 years [17], which differs markedly from the current study where the average

443

disease duration is 5.16 years. The present study also excluded PD subjects with dementia,

444

fundamentally distinguishing it from our previous work [70]. This is crucial as PD dementia

445

is associated with decreases in FC compared to subjects without the diagnosis [71]. Our

446

findings of increased FC between the MD/A thalamus and the anterior putamen are supported

447

by similar research in this field [65]. This research demonstrated that increased inter-regional

448

coupling of the anterior putamen, the region anterior to the anterior commissure, follow the

449

specific spatial pattern of dopamine depletion in PD [4]. This research suggests that PD

450

patients may undergo a shift in cortico-striatal connections from the neuro-chemically more

451

affected posterior putamen toward the relatively spared anterior putamen. Our results support

452

this finding, suggesting that the anterior putamen may undergo increased FC with the MD/A

453

thalamus, further supporting the model that the pathophysiology of PD may involve

454

compensatory alterations in the FC of key nuclei within basal ganglia-thalamocortical

455

circuits.

456
457

While conceiving of FC changes in terms of segregated basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits

458

is attractive, this inference is theoretical. It is therefore helpful to consider the results of other

459

imaging techniques to substantiate our findings. Graph-based eigenvector centrality mapping

460

research (which informs on the number and quality of node connections within networks) has

461

shown that this metric is increased in the thalamus in PD [72]. Interestingly, we also found a

462

significant (though small) cluster of reduced FC of both the VLp/VA and MD/A thalamus

463

with the lateral occipital cortex in PD patients, supporting previous work which found

464

reductions in FC between nuclei of the extended basal-ganglia (including the thalamus) and

465

this area of the brain [72]. The findings from

18

F-flurodeoxyglucose PET imaging has

466

indicated that PD is associated with increased pallidothalamic activity [73], which supports

467

our findings. However, this research also demonstrated that regions of the dorsolateral

468

prefrontal cortex and the supplementary and premotor areas show reductions in metabolic

469

activity in PD, contrasting with our results [73].

470
471

We found no significant correlation between FC of our seed-ROI in the thalamus and

472

measures of clinical function, disease duration or antiparkinsonian medication use. This

473

supports previous meta-analytic research which indicates that FC within a basal-ganglia

474

networks does not correlate with clinical indices of disease severity [74], arguing instead that

475

altered FC reflects a constitutional alteration of the networks under consideration. Our results

476

are also bolstered by meta-analytic findings which indicate that increased FC of the thalamus

477

were unaffected by medication status [57].

478
479

The morphological data from our study are consistent with previous reports indicating that

480

PD is not associated with atrophy of the thalamus [21, 23-28]. We also found no significant

481

localized surface shape changes in the PD group, supporting a number of studies [21, 24, 25].

482

After investigating between-group morphological differences we investigated potential

483

relationships between volumes of the thalamus and measures of clinical function. These

484

analyses revealed no significant findings, supporting previous research [21, 27, 28]. These

485

results make intuitive sense, as we found no significant volumetric or localized shape

486

changes in the PD cohort, suggesting there was no discernable relationship between atrophy

487

of the thalamus and the PD disease process.

Strengths and Limitations

490

Possible limitations of the current work warrant further attention. The first is our small

491

sample size. While this is an important factor that negatively impacts the power of our study,

492

our sample size was the result of choosing a highly stringent head motion exclusion criteria,

493

which we believe is a strength of our work. A second possible limitation is the use of atlas-

494

based seed-ROI segmentation, defined by the structural connectivity of thalamic nuclei [49].

495

Future work may benefit from a data-driven parcellation scheme as it may better capture

496

functional boundaries of seed-ROIs. Despite these considerations we believe our data make

497

important statements about the role of the thalamus within basal ganglia-thalamocortical

498

circuits in PD.

499
500

Conclusions

501

We found increases in functional connectivity between the VLp/VA thalamus and the

502

supplementary motor area and paracingulate gyrus, and also between the MD/A thalamus and

503

basal ganglia nuclei, anterior and paracingulate cingulate gyri, anterior and also dorsolateral

504

prefrontal cortical regions. Significant increases in functional connectivity were found despite

505

any observable volumetric or localized shape alterations to the thalamus. The results of this

506

study indicate that functional connectivity changes occur in PD, which likely result from

507

disease-related system level dysfunction of the thalamus as a crucial network hub within

508

basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits.
