Abstract

26

Background and Aims: There have been few prospective studies of association between

27

alcohol use and cognitive functioning in young people. We aim to examine whether alcohol

28

use is a risk factor for deficient cognitive functioning in young adults.

29

Design: Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to derive patterns of binge drinking. Linear

30

regression was used to examine the relationship between binge drinking and subsequent

31

cognitive functioning. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) tested evidence for the

32

causal relationship between alcohol use and cognitive functioning.

33

Setting: South West England.

34

Participants: The observational study comprised of 2086 adolescents and their parents (fully

35

adjusted models) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

36

Measurements: Binge drinking was assessed on five occasions from age 16 to 23 years.

37

Cognitive functioning comprised working memory, response inhibition, and emotion

38

recognition assessed at 24 years of age. 99-independent genome-wide significant SNPs

39

associated with ‘number of drinks per week’ was used as the genetic instrument for alcohol

40

consumption. Potential confounders were included.

41

Findings: Four binge drinking classes were identified: ‘low-risk’ (41%), ‘adolescent-limited’

42

(19%), ‘adult-regular’ (23%), and ‘early-onset regular’ (17%). There was not a consistent

43

association between binge drinking and subsequent cognitive functioning. For example, we

44

found insufficient evidence to support an association between early-onset regular binge

45

drinking and cognitive functioning in the fully adjusted models: working memory (b=0.09, 95%

46

CI=-0.10 to 0.28), response inhibition (b=0.70, 95% CI=-10.55 to 11.95), and emotion

47

recognition (b=0.01, 95% CI=-0.01 to 0.02) compared to low-risk drinkers. Two-sample MR

48

analyses similarly provided little evidence that alcohol use is associated with deficits in

Conclusions: Binge drinking in adolescence and early adulthood may not be a strong predictor

52

for deficient cognitive functioning in young adults.

INTRODUCTION

55

Alcohol use during adolescence, when the brain is still developing and undergoing

56

considerable structural and functional changes (1) is a major public health concern. The

57

association between binge drinking and cognitive functioning (i.e., working memory,

58

response inhibition, and emotion recognition) has received particular attention because some

59

cognitive functions do not peak until early adulthood (2–5) in parallel with maturation of the

60

prefrontal cortex (6,7).

61

There is a wealth of evidence from animal (8,9), neuroimaging (10–12), twin (13,14),

62

and cognitive neuroscience (15,16) studies suggesting that adolescent binge drinking is

63

negatively associated with cognitive functioning. However, the direction of this association

64

remains unclear as many of these results are based on evidence from small cross-sectional

65

studies. Studies that have examined this association using prospective data have largely

66

revealed mixed findings. For example, some studies have found that alcohol use preceded

67

deficits in domains of cognitive functioning (17–20), while other studies have provided

68

support for the opposite direction (21–23).

69

In an effort to strengthen the evidence we used a triangulation approach with

70

observational and genetic epidemiological methods to better understand the causal

71

relationships between drinking patterns and cognitive functioning in young adults using data

72

from Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The aims were to investigate

73

(1) whether patterns of binge drinking (assessed between 16 to 23 years) were associated

74

with working memory, response inhibition, and emotion recognition assessed at age 24, and

75

(2) whether alcohol use was associated with cognitive functioning using two-sample

76

Mendelian randomisation (MR) (24). MR can reduce bias from residual confounding and

77

reverse causation by using genetic variants that are known to be associated with the exposure

78

(25). We expected to find that more regular binge drinking would be associated with deficient

79

cognitive functioning, and that this association would be supported by the MR analyses.

81

METHODS

82

Design

83

Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to derive heterogenous patterns of binge

84

drinking from ages 16 to 23 years. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship

85

between patterns of binge drinking and subsequent cognitive functioning. The young person

86

provided self-reported information on binge drinking and cognitive functioning. The clear

87

temporal ordering of exposure, outcome and confounders helps to rule out the possibility of

88

reverse causality. Two-sample MR tested evidence for the causal relationship between

89

alcohol use and cognitive functioning.

90

Observational analyses

91

Participants and Procedure

92

We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), an

93

ongoing population-based study that contains a wide range of phenotypic and environmental

94

measures, genetic information and linkage to health and administrative records. A fully

95

searchable

http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/. Approval for the study was obtained

97

from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees.

98

Informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics was obtained

99

from participants following recommendations of the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at

100

the time. Consent for biological samples has been collected in accordance with the Human

south-west of England and had an estimated date of delivery between 1 April 1991 and

103

December 1992 were eligible for the study (Phase I consisted of N=14,541). Of the 13,988

104

offspring alive at one year, a small number of participants have withdrawn fully from the

105

study (n=41), leaving an eligible sample of 13,947. Detailed information about ALSPAC is

106

available online www.bris.ac.uk/alspac and in the cohort profiles (26–28). A detailed overview

107

of our study population, including attrition at the different measurement occasions is

Measures

110

A timeline of data collection is presented in Supplementary Material Figure S2.

111

Exposure: Binge drinking

112

Information on binge drinking was collected on five occasions via a questionnaire (Q)

113

or during attendance at a study clinic (C). Median ages at response were: 16y 7m (Q), 17y 9m

114

(C), 18y 8m (Q) 21y (Q), and 23y (Q) using the following question reflecting drinking over the

115

past year “How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?”. One drink was

116

specified as ½ pint (568 ml) average strength beer/lager, one glass of wine, or one single

117

measure (25ml) of spirits. Responses at each time point were used to derive a repeated 3

118

level ordinal variable with categories “Never/Occasional” (comprising of “Never” and “Less

119

than monthly”), “Monthly” and “Weekly”. Daily or almost daily was collapsed into the

120

“Weekly” group.

121

Outcome variables

122

At 24 years of age (M=24.0 years; SD=9.8 months) participants attended a clinic-based

123

assessment which included computerised cognitive assessments as part of a broader

124

assessment battery of mental and physical health and behaviour. Data collection for the

125

online questionnaires was collected and manged by REDcap electronic data capture tools

126

(29,30).

127

Working memory

128

The N-back task (2-back condition) was used to assess working memory. Participants

129

were asked to monitor the series of numbers (0-9) and respond with a ‘1’ keystroke when any

130

number was the same as the one presented 2 trials previously, and a ‘2’ keystroke if it was

131

different. Forty-eight trials were presented, including eight 2-back matches. The N-back task

132

(31) is widely used to measure working memory (17,32,33). A measure of discriminability (dʹ)

133

was chosen as the primary outcome measure given it is an overall performance estimate. High

134

scores on number of hits indicated more accurate identification, while high scores on false

135

alarms indicated less accurate identification. High scores on dʹ, therefore, indicated a greater

136

ability to distinguish signal from noise. Of the participants assessed with cognitive tasks at age

137

24 (n=3,312), n=182 did not provide any data on the task; n=70 were omitted due to negative

138

d’ scores and/or not responding to over 50% of the trials, leaving a sample of n=3,242.

139

Response inhibition

140

The Stop Signal Task (34) was used to assess response inhibition – the ability to

141

prevent an ongoing motor response. Participants were asked to respond to visual stimuli (X

142

and O response keys to X and O letters presented sequentially on a screen) unless a tone was

143

heard (the stop signal) after the stimulus presentation, at which point they were required to

144

withhold responding. The task consisted of 256 trials, which included a 4:1 ratio of trials

145

without stop signals to trials with stop signals. Mean response times were calculated. An

146

estimate of stop signal reaction time (SSRT) was calculated and used as the primary outcome

147

as it is a reliable measure of inhibitory control, with shorter SSRT’s indicating faster inhibition.

148

SSRT data were available for n=3,201 participants.

149

Emotion recognition

150

Emotion recognition was assessed using a six alternative forced choice (6AFC) emotion

151

recognition task (35) comprising of 96 trials (16 for each emotion) which measures the ability

152

to identify emotions in facial expressions. In each trial, participants were presented with a

153

face displaying one of six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or

154

surprise. Participants were required to select the descriptor that best described the emotion

155

that was present in the face, using the computer mouse. Emotion intensity varied across 8

156

levels within each emotion from the prototypical emotion to an almost neutral face. Each

157

individual stimulus was presented twice, giving a total of 96 trials. An overall measure of ER

158

(the number of facial emotions accurately identified) was used as the primary outcome. ER

159

data were available for n=3,368 participants. Further information on all three cognitive tasks

160

is presented in Supplementary material.

161

Potential confounders

162

We identified confounders from established risk factors for cognitive functioning that

163

could plausibly have a causal predictive relationship with earlier binge drinking including

164

income, maternal education, socioeconomic position, housing tenure, sex, and maternal

165

smoking during first trimester in pregnancy. Two measures were included to control for

166

cognitive function prior to alcohol initiation. Working memory at approximately 11 years and

167

experience of a head injury/unconsciousness up to 11 years. Finally, measures of cigarette

168

and cannabis use were collected at 4 timepoints between ages ~14 and ~16.5 years (up to the

169

first assessment of binge drinking). Further information is presented in Supplementary

170

material.

173

The observational analyses were conducted in two stages. First, longitudinal latent

174

class analysis was used to derive trajectories of binge drinking for individuals having at least

175

one measure of binge drinking (n=6,888). Starting with a single latent class, additional classes

176

were added until model fit was optimised. See supplementary material for a description of

177

model fit. Analyses were carried out using Mplus 8.1 (36).

178

Class membership was then related to covariates using the three-step method using

179

the Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars (37) method. The first stage estimated the latent class

180

measurement model and saves the weights. While, the second stage involved using these

181

weights which reflect the measurement error of the latent class variable. Linear regression

182

was used to examine the association between the continuous distal outcomes and latent class

183

membership controlling for the confounding variables. Results are reported as

184

unstandardised beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals.

185

Missing data

186

6,888 participants (49%) provided self-report information on binge drinking on at least

187

one occasion. Of these, n=3,755 (55%) had available information on all covariates, while

188

n=2,086 (30%) had data on at least one outcome at age 24 years and all confounders. See

189

Table S1 for a detailed description of attrition.

190

Mendelian randomisation (MR)

191

Two-sample MR was used to test the hypothesised causal effect of alcohol use on

192

cognitive functioning. The two-sample MR approach requires summary level data from

193

GWAS, enabling SNP-outcome and SNP-exposure effects to be derived from different data

194

sources. As the genetic instrument for alcohol consumption we used the 99-independent

195

genome-wide significant SNPs associated with ‘number of drinks per week’, identified by the

https://gscan.sph.umich.edu/) based on a sample of N~1,000,000. As outcomes, we used

198

GWAS conducted in ALSPAC for each of our three primary outcome measures: i) working

199

memory assessed using d’; ii) response inhibition assessed using SSRT; and iii) emotion

200

recognition assessed using total number of recognised emotions.

201

Analyses were performed using the TwoSampleMR R package, part of MR-Base

202

(38). The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach was used as a primary analysis, with

203

three complementary estimation methods as sensitivity analyses which each make different

204

assumptions about the nature of horizontal pleiotropy (where the genetic variant associates

205

with the outcome via an independent pathway to the exposure): MR Egger (39), weighted

206

median (40), and weighted mode (41). To test the suitability of the MR Egger method, the I2GX

207

statistic was calculated to quantify the degree of regression dilution bias due to measurement

208

error of SNP-exposure effects (42). The mean F statistic as an indicator of instrument strength

209

was also calculated. Steiger filtering was conducted to confirm the direction of effect (43). A

210

consistent effect across all of these methods would provide the most confidence that any

211

observed effects are not due to pleiotropy.

Patterns of binge drinking

215

The prevalence of both monthly and weekly binge drinking increased across time

216

apart from a slight decrease at age 23 years (Table S2). There was good agreement that a

217

four-class solution was adequate in explaining the heterogeneity in binge drinking based on

218

increasing Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (44) and sample size adjusted Bayesian

219

Information Criterion (SSABIC) (45) values in the five-class model and an LRT value of p=0.05.

Working memory – 2-back task

228

Table 1 presents unadjusted and adjusted associations between patterns of binge

229

drinking from 16 to 23 years and working memory at age 24. There were unadjusted

230

associations for adult-regular (b=0.21, 95% CI=0.03 to 0.40) and early-onset regular (b=0.19,

231

95% CI=0.01 to 0.36) being associated with better working memory performance compared

232

to the low-risk binge drinking group. These associations were attenuated after adjustment for

233

sociodemographic confounders (adult-regular: b=0.14, 95% CI=-0.05 to 0.33; early-onset

234

regular: b=0.14, 95% CI=-0.07 to 0.30); working memory at age 11 years and participants who

235

experienced a head injury/unconsciousness before age 11 (adult-regular: b=0.12, 95% CI=-

236

0.06, 0.31; early-onset regular: b=0.06, 95% CI=-0.12 to 0.24), and cannabis and/or tobacco

237

use (adult-regular: b=0.12, 95% CI=-0.07 to 0.31; early-onset regular: b=0.09, 95% CI=-0.10 to

238

0.28). There was no evidence of an association between other patterns of binge drinking and

239

working memory performance. Furthermore, there was little evidence to suggest that

240

patterns of binge drinking were associated with the secondary outcomes (i.e., number of hits

241

and false alarms). Results of the secondary analyses are provided in Table S6 in the

242

Supplementary Material.

Table 2 presents unadjusted and adjusted associations between patterns of binge

246

drinking and an overall measure of response inhibition. Although, there was evidence for

247

adolescent-limited being associated with longer SSRT, indicating slower ability to inhibit

248

responses (b=19.65, 95% CI=3.20 to 36.09) compared to the low-risk binge drinking group in

249

the unadjusted models, omnibus Wald test values provided weak evidence of an overall

250

association between binge drinking patterns and response inhibition in the fully adjusted

251

model (Wald test=6.51 (3) p=0.09). There was no evidence of an association between other

252

patterns of binge drinking and ability to inhibit responses. Furthermore, there was little

253

evidence to suggest that patterns of binge drinking were associated with any of the secondary

254

outcomes (i.e., Go reaction time, Go accuracy, and Stop accuracy). Results of the secondary

analyses are provided in Table S7 in the Supplementary Material.

regular being associated with better performance on the task (b=0.02, 95% CI=0.00 to 0.03)

261

compared to the low-risk binge drinking group in the unadjusted models, these associations

262

were attenuated when controlling for confounders (fully adjusted model: b=0.01, 95% CI=-

263

0.00 to 0.03). There was no evidence of an association between other patterns of binge

264

drinking and number of correct hits. Furthermore, there was little evidence to suggest that

265

patterns of binge drinking were associated with any of the secondary outcomes (i.e., anger,

disgust, fear, happy, sad, and surprise). Results of the secondary analyses are provided in

Mendelian randomisation

270

GWAS did not identify any genome-wide significant SNPs (at the p<5x10-8 level) for

271

any of the three cognitive outcomes, therefore we report the lead SNPs at a p<5x10-6

272

threshold (Tables S9-S11). The full distribution of results can be seen in Manhattan plots

273

(Figures S3-S5). QQ plots, and corresponding lambda (λ) statistics, are displayed in Figures S6-

274

S8. The lead SNP for working memory was rs7992404 (chromosome 13, b=-0.17, CI=-0.20 to

275

-0.14, effect allele=T, p=8.76x10-8, intergenic variant), emotion recognition: rs199934102

276

(chromosome 6, b=0.34, CI=0.28 to 0.40, effect allele=A, p=8.19 x 10-8, intronic variant within

277

gene CNKSR3), and response inhibition: rs9853329 (chromosome 3, b=-0.16, CI=-0.19 to-0.13,

278

effect allele=T, p=5.33x10-7, intergenic variant).

279

The two-sample MR method provides little evidence to suggest that alcohol use (SNPs

280

associated with number of drinks per week) is a causal risk factor for deficits in cognitive

281

functioning (Table 4). Focusing on the IVW estimate as the primary measure, SNPs associated

282

with the number of alcoholic drinks per week were not associated with d’ on the working

283

memory task (b=0.137 95% CI=-0.45 to 0.72; p=0.65); SSRT on the response inhibition task

284

(b=-0.313 95%CI=-0.92 to 0.29; p=0.31); or total hits in the emotion recognition task (b=0.028

285

95% CI=-0.55 to 0.61; p=0.93). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the SNP-exposure

286

association (Tables S12 and S13 in the Supplementary material).

DISCUSSION

289

We found insufficient evidence to suggest an association between binge drinking

290

between the ages of 16 and 23 and cognitive deficits at age 24 using a combination of

291

observational and genetic approaches. In the observational analyses, four patterns of binge

292

drinking across adolescence and early adulthood were identified. These patterns were not

293

associated with later measures of cognitive functioning in either the unadjusted or adjusted

294

models. In the genetic analyses, there was no evidence to suggest that number of drinks

295

consumed per week was a causal risk factor for deficits in cognitive functioning in the ALSPAC

296

sample.

297

Comparison with previous studies

298

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the relationship between

299

alcohol use and cognitive functioning using a combination of observational and genetic

300

epidemiological approaches. Unlike the studies that have demonstrated a prospective

301

association between binge drinking and cognitive functioning in adolescence e.g. (17–20), we

302

found little evidence in support of this association. The contrast in findings could be due to a

303

number of possibilities. First, our study used a large population sample incorporating data

304

from over 2,000 participants spanning maternal pregnancy to 24 years of age. Previous

305

studies (19,20) used functional magnetic resonance imaging based on youths at high-risk for

306

substance use disorders (n=40 for both studies), while the study by Peeters and colleagues

307

(18) used a sample at high-risk for externalising problems (n=374 at baseline). Second, this

308

study assessed cognitive functioning in early adulthood, a time when cognitions are thought

309

to reach maturity (2–5), in comparison to all four studies who assessed cognitive functioning

310

up to 19 years of age. Examining peak levels of cognitive functioning helps to reduce the

311

possibility that cognitive functioning is influencing earlier alcohol use (i.e., reverse causation).

312

Third, as alcohol use behaviours typically change over time (46), repeated measures of binge

313

drinking were used in this study to capture heterogenous patterns across this sensitive period

314

in comparison to our previous study which assessed alcohol use on one occasion (17). Finally,

315

most of the previous studies (18–20) assessed cognitive functioning using a range of measures

14

316

compared to the more widely used measures in this study (i.e., N-back task, Stop signal task,

317

and 6AFC task).

318

Our findings support and extend those of Boelema and colleagues (47) who found

319

insufficient evidence to suggest that alcohol use prospectively affected maturation of

320

cognitive functions in a large prospective study of Dutch adolescents (48). Frist, Boelema and

321

colleagues examined cognitive functioning across adolescence, while we were able to

322

examine peak levels of cognitive functioning. Second, assessing binge drinking in young

323

adulthood allowed us to capture heterogenous patterns during the sensitive period (i.e.,

324

going to University or in full-time paid employment). Finally, WM performance was measured

325

in reaction times only, as opposed to the more comprehensive approach used in our study

326

(i.e., number of hits, false alarms, and d’).

327

Limitations

328

There are a number of limitations to this study. First, the ALSPAC cohort suffers from

329

attrition which reduces study power and also is higher among the socially disadvantaged (49)

330

(Table S1). We attempted to minimise the impact of attrition using sensitivity analyses. It is

331

possible that both the observational and two-sample MR analyses are underpowered. For

332

example, poor entropy (a measure of class separation) in the observational analyses could

333

indicate poor misclassification in the latent classes resulting in dilution of effect estimates.

334

Small sample size in the cognitive functioning GWAS is likely to be underpowered in the two-

335

sample MR analyses. Future studies should use larger observational samples and meta-

336

analyses of related cognitive measures in GWAS to help to increase power. Second, although

337

it is possible to either under- or over-estimate drinking behaviour using self-reported data,

338

participants completed questionnaires individually and were assured of their anonymity.

339

Third, although there is some debate in the literature surrounding the construct validity of

15

340

performance on the N-back task as an indicator of working memory ability, it has been argued

341

that using N-back performance indices from a signal-detection framework (i.e. d’) may reveal

342

clearer insights about its validity as a measure of working memory performance (50–52).

343

Fourth, as we examined one potential causal pathway, it is possible that the

344

association could work in the opposite direction, that is, impairments in cognitive functioning

345

may precede (and increase the risk of developing) alcohol problems (18,23). We were

346

however able to include a number of measures to maximise the robustness of our findings:

347

(i) ascertaining the time order of exposures and outcomes; (ii) controlling for premorbid

348

working memory function and brain insults prior to the onset of alcohol use; and (iii) a number

349

of relevant confounders were included to help reduce the possibility of residual confounding.

350

It is possible that a common risk factor is influencing both binge drinking and deficits in

351

cognition, however the MR analyses helps to protect against this possibility by minimising

352

bias from reverse causation and residual confounding. Finally, genetic variants were based on

353

number of drinks per week, whereas the observational analyses used frequency of binge

354

drinking. Although not directly comparable, there was evidence of a dose-response

355

relationship between binge drinking patterns and the AUDIT-C measure, which taps into

356

quantity and frequency (see Supplementary material).

357

Implications and Conclusions

358

In order to rule out the possibility of deficient cognitive functioning preceding binge

359

drinking in adolescence, future research should use an equally robust approach to examine

360

the alternate hypothesis. We found insufficient evidence to suggest an association between

361

binge drinking between the ages of 16 and 23 and cognitive deficits at age 24 using a

362

combination of observational and genetic approaches, although both approaches are likely

363

to be underpowered.

Figure 1. Distribution of binge drinking response across latent classes at each timepoint (n=6,888). Class proportions based on estimated
posterior probability1

Overall, the low-risk group reported a low probability of binge drinking across all measurement occasions; adolescent-limited binge drinkers was mostly characterised by
binge drinking in the earlier measurement occasions (but not later ones), adult-regular binge drinkers were mostly characterised by binge drinking in the later
measurement occasions (but not earlier ones), while early-onset regular binge drinking was mostly characterised by binge drinking across all timepoints.
