Abstract: (273 words)
Purpose: The known EOC susceptibility genes account for less than 50% of the heritable risk
of ovarian cancer suggesting other susceptibility genes exist. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the contribution to ovarian cancer susceptibility of rare deleterious germline
variants in a set of candidate genes.

Methods: We sequenced the coding region of 54 candidate genes in 6385 invasive EOC
cases and 6115 controls of broad European ancestry. Genes with an increased frequency of
putative deleterious variants in cases verses controls were further examined in an
independent set of 14,146 EOC cases and 28,661 controls from the ovarian cancer
association consortium and the UK Biobank. For each gene, we estimated the EOC risks and
evaluated associations between germline variant status and clinical characteristics.

Results: The odds ratios (OR) associated for high-grade serous ovarian cancer were 3.01 for
PALB2 (95% CI 1.59 – 5.68; P = 0.00068), 1.99 for POLK (95% CI 1.15 – 3.43; P = 0.014), and
4.07 for SLX4 (95% CI 1.34- 12.4; P = 0.013). Deleterious mutations in FBXO10 were
associated with a reduced risk of disease (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 -1.00, P=0.049). However,
based on the Bayes false discovery probability, only the association for PALB2 in high-grade
serous ovarian cancer is likely to represent a true positive.

Conclusions: We have found strong evidence that carriers of PALB2 deleterious mutations
are at increased risk of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Whether the magnitude of risk is
sufficiently high to warrant the inclusion of PALB2 in cancer gene panels for ovarian cancer
risk testing is unclear; much larger sample sizes will be needed to provide sufficiently precise
estimates for clinical counselling.

INTRODUCTION
Rare, predicted deleterious variants in multiple genes have been shown to be associated
with a moderate to high risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These include the DNA
double stand break repair genes BRCA1[1], BRCA[2], BRIP1[3], RAD51C, and RAD51[4], and the
mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MSH6[5 6]. ANKRD11, FANCM and POLE have recently
been reported as possible susceptibility genes[7 8]. Multiple common variants conferring
weaker risk effects have also been identified[9-16], some of which modify EOC risk in carriers
of more highly penetrant gene mutations[17 18].
EOC is heterogeneous with five main histotypes: High-grade serous (HGSOC), low-grade
serous (LGSC), endometrioid, clear cell and mucinous ovarian cancer. These have different
clinical characteristics and outcomes and are characterized by different germline and
somatic genetic changes that result in the perturbation of different molecular pathways.
For example, germline mutations in DNA double break repair genes predispose to HGSOC
while germline mutations in mismatch repair genes increase risk of the endometrioid and
clear cell histotypes[6].
The known susceptibility alleles account for less than 50% of the excess familial risk of
ovarian cancer, suggesting that other susceptibility genes and alleles exist [14].

The

unexplained genetic component of risk is likely to be made up of a combination of common
genetic variants conferring weak effects and uncommon alleles conferring weak to
moderate relative risks (less than 10-fold).
The aim of this study was to identify additional ovarian cancer susceptibility genes using
case-control sequencing of candidate genes identified through various approaches including
their known function in pathways that are associated with ovarian cancer development, and

deleterious mutations in genes not previously evaluated for EOC risk.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Selection of candidate genes
Genes based on known biological function:

As several EOC susceptibility genes are involved

in DNA double-strand break repair and Fanconi anemia (FA) [8], we selected genes involved
in these pathways. FA is a rare genetic disease characterized by chromosomal instability,
hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, defective DNA repair, severe bone marrow
failure, cancer susceptibility and many congenital defects. To date, more than 20 FA genes
have been identified. We selected eight FA genes not previously studied in ovarian cancer:

FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCG, FANCI, FANCP (SLX4). We also included
FANCN (PALB2), which has been studied previously in ovarian cancer [3 19-21] but its
association with EOC risk is equivocal. Eight candidate genes involved in other aspects of
DNA repair were also included: ALKBH3, CHEK2, GTF2H4, POLE, POLK, RDM1, REV3L, and

XRCC1.
Genes from whole exome sequencing studies (WES):

Twelve genes (BUB1B, C5orf28, C6,

DNAJB4, EXO1, LIG4, MKNK2, MMRN1, PARP1, RAD52, SMC1A and SNRNP200) were
selected from WES analysis of EOC cases where putative deleterious (truncating) mutations
were identified at a greater frequency in cases compared to publicly available WES data
from controls reported by the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and The Exome
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) databases (http://exac.broadinstitute.org). Germline WES
data for EOC cases were available for 412 HGSOC cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) ovarian cancer study; 513 ovarian cancer cases from an Australian case series ; 97
familial non-BRCA1/BRCA2 ovarian cancer cases from Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer

Registry (GRR); and 54 ovarian cancer cases from the UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry
(UKR).
Four genes from these WES studies (GANC, KNTC1, PSG6 and UPK2) were selected because
more than one family member diagnosed with ovarian cancer from 10 familial cases carried
the same truncating mutation in one of these genes.
Finally, twenty-one genes were selected from analyses of several other unpublished EOC
WES studies (personal communications) where the frequency of truncating mutations was
greater in cases compared to controls.

These genes were ANAPC2, CNKSR1, DUOX1,

FBXO10, NAT10, OSGIN1, PAK4, PHF20L1, PIK3C2G, PTGER3, PTX3, RAD54B, RECQL, RIPK3,
RNASEL, SMG5, SPHK1, SULT1C2, UHRF2, WNT5A and ZFHX3.

Study subjects
We used case-control data from targeted sequencing, exome and array-based genotyping.

Targeted sequencing: We included 5,914 EOC cases and 5,479 controls of European
ancestries from nineteen studies - thirteen case-control studies, one familial ovarian cancer
study from Poland, two clinical trials and three case-only studies (Supplementary Table

1)[13]. HGSOC cases were preferentially plated out for sequencing where possible.
Exome sequencing: We extracted data on the 54 candidate genes from 829 case and 913
controls from two ovarian cancer case-control studies (MDA[22-24] and NCO[13]) for which
whole exome sequence data were available (Supplementary Table 1).

Variants from genotyping array data: For genes that reached nominal significance in the
combined analysis of the targeted sequencing and exome sequencing data, we extracted
genotypes of any deleterious variants included on the OncoArray and UK Biobank Axiom

Array. These two arrays were used to genotype up to 18,936 controls and 13,288 cases
from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC)[14], 9,725 controls and 858 cases
from UK Biobank GWAS (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) respectively. Samples overlapped
with the sequencing studies were excluded from the analysis.
All studies had ethics committee approval, and all participants provided informed consent.

Sequencing methods
Target sequence enrichment followed by sequencing was performed on the coding
sequence and splice-sites of ALKBH3, ANAPC2, BUB1B, C5ORF28, C6, CHEK2, CNKSR1,
DNAJB4, DUOX1, EXO1, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCG, FANCI, FBXO10,
GANC, GTF2H4, KNTC1, LIG4, MKNK2, MMRN1, NAT10, OSGIN1, PAK4, PALB2, PARP1,

RIPK3, RNASEL, SLX4, SMC1A, SMG5, SNRNP200, SPHK1, SULT1C2, UHRF2, UPK2, WNT5A,
XRCC1 and ZFHX3, using 48.48 Fluidigm access arrays as previously described[6]. A total of
1,663 amplicons were designed to cover the 159kb target region. Libraries were sequenced
using 150 bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq4000 or HiSeq2500.
Sequencing reads were de-multiplexed then aligned against the human genome reference
sequence (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [25]. The Genome Analysis
Toolkit (GATK) [26] was used for base quality-score recalibration, local indel realignment
and variant calling. Finally, ANNOVAR [27] was used for variant annotation. Variants were
called if (1) genotype information was available from a chip genotype for that sample, or (2)
the variants were presented in more than one amplicon, or (3) read depth ≥15 and alternate
allele frequency ≥40 percent, or (4) read depth ≥100 and alternate allele frequency ≥ 25

percent. These thresholds were defined using the results from sequencing of positive
controls with known variants and genotype information from chip array genotyping of
overlapping samples.
We excluded 356 cases and 269 controls because <80 percent of the target sequence bases
had a read depth of at least 15. The average percentage coverage of the genes at 15X read
depth ranged from 64% - 99% (Supplementary Table 2). The mean sequencing depth for
these genes ranged from 130 (IQR 104 – 152) to 432 (IQR 364 – 492). Concordance for 111
duplicate pairs was 98% (7384 concordant variants out of total 7572 variants called).
For the exome sequencing, sonication fragmentation was used to fragment DNA samples.
Fragments with an average size of 200bp were selected to generate libraries for sequencing.
Agilent SureSelect Clinical Research Exome (CRE) v1 was used for exome enrichment and
sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using 2x150bp paired-end reads.
Cutadapt (https://doi.org/10.14806/ej.17.1.200) was used to locate and remove residual
adapters in reads. FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads)[28] was used to merge
the overlapped paired-end reads into one read, using default parameters.

genome alignment and joint genotype calling according to a pipeline described in Yu et
al[29]. The coding sequences and splice sites of all 54 genes were extracted. Fifty-three
genes with 100% average coverage at 10X were included in the analysis. GTF2H4 was
excluded from the analysis, as the average coverage was only 43%.
Deleterious variants were defined as those predicted to result in protein truncation
(frameshift indel, splice site, nonsense mutations and start loss) or predicted to be
deleterious and/or likely deleterious by Clinvar[30]. We used the software MaxEntScan to
identify splice site variants most likely to affect gene splicing [31] – those with a MaxEntScan

score that decreased by more than 40% compared to the reference sequence and having a
reference sequence score ≥3. Sequencing alignments were confirmed by visual inspection
using the Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) [32].

Statistical methods
Risk Estimation and genotype-phenotype analyses: We used a simple burden test for
association between deleterious variants and ovarian cancer risk on a gene-by-gene basis.
The burden test was based on unconditional logistic regression adjusted for country
(Australia, Denmark, German, Poland, the United Kingdom and the USA) and sequencing
method (targeted sequencing or exome sequencing). Odds ratios and associated 95 percent
confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.

Missense variant analyses: We also identified multiple rare (minor allele frequency < 1%)
missense variants that have an unknown functional effect on the protein. We used the rare
admixture likelihood (RAML) burden test[33] to test these variants for association. We
classified variants by whether or not they are predicted to have a damaging effect on
protein function by 2 out of 3 prediction tools - SIFT (score <0.05)[34], polyphen-2[35]
(classified as probably damaging or damaging) and Provean[36] (score<=-2.5). Subjects with
a missense variant call rate less than 80 percent and variants with a call rate less than 80
percent or with genotype frequencies inconsistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<105

) were excluded.

RESULTS
Germline deleterious mutations in ovarian cancer cases and controls
Sequencing results were available for 6,385 EOC cases and 6,115 controls after quality
control analysis. The characteristics of these individuals by study are summarized in

Supplementary Table 1. Most EOC cases were serous histotype (N= 6,304, 98.7 percent), of
which 5,951 were the HGSOC histotype (93.2 percent).
We identified 628 unique, putative-deleterious variants (Supplementary Table 3) in 909
HGSOC cases (14.2 percent) and 873 controls (14.3 percent). There was a nominally
significant higher frequency of mutations in cases compared to controls for POLK, PALB2
and SLX4 and a lower frequency of mutations in cases compared to controls for FBXO10
(Table 1). The associated odds ratios are shown in Table 1 – for POLK, PALB2 and SLX4 the
effect size was slightly larger for HGSOC. The frequency of deleterious variants in the other
genes was similar in cases compared to controls (Supplementary Table 4). Given the
evidence for association of multiple Fanconi anemia genes with EOC risk we also carried out
a burden test to compare the frequency of deleterious variants in any of the eight genes
which were not significantly associated with ovarian cancer risks individually (FANCA, FANCB,

FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCG, FANCI and FANCL). A combined analysis will have greater
power if multiple genes were associated but the effect sizes too small to detect individually.
There was no significant difference in the frequency of deleterious variants in cases
(96/6184, 1.6%) and controls (85/6,089, 1.4%) (P = 0.50).

Validation analyses in ovarian cancer case-control studies
We also evaluated risk associations between deleterious variants in POLK, PALB2, and SLX4
with EOC risk based on germline genotyping data for 13,277 EOC cases and 18,930 controls
from OCAC and for 858 EOC cases and 9,725 controls and from UK Biobank. For OCAC
samples, data were available for six deleterious non-monomorphic variants in PALB2; for UK
Biobank samples, data were available for seven PALB2 and one POLK deleterious variants

Information on tumor grade was not available for UK Biobank cases, all the serous cases in UK Biobank were

assumed to be HGSOC.

In OCAC case-control analyses, PALB2 variants showed a non-significant increased risk of
EOC (OR 2.10, 95% CI 0.74 -5.94, P=0.16). The strength of this association increased when
the analysis was restricted to 6,181 HGSOC cases (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.10 -11.1, P=0.035). In
UK Biobank we observed a weak association for PALB2 mutations with EOC risk (OR 3.12,
95% CI 0.87-11.2, P=0.081). There was no evidence of risk association for mutations in POLK
and SLX4 (Table 2).

We then performed a meta-analysis by combining the targeted sequencing, whole exome
sequencing and chip genotyping data. Taken together, putative deleterious mutations were
associated with increased risk for PALB2 (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.45 – 4.64; P = 0.0013), POLK (OR
1.77, 95% CI 1.07 – 2.93; P = 0.026) and SLK4 (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.17-9.70, P=0.024), and
decreased risk for FBXO10 (95%CI 0.07- 1.00; P=0.049).

After stratifying cases by

histological subtype, the estimated risks were higher for HGSOC for PALB2 (OR 3.01, 95% CI
1.59 – 5.68; P = 0.00068), POLK (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.15 – 3.43; P = 0.014) and SLK4 (OR 3.92,
95%CI 1.33-11.5; P = 0.013).
We used an approximate Bayes factor to calculate the Bayes false discovery probability
(BFDP) described by Wakefield[37] for PALB2, SLX4, POLK and FBXO10 based on several
different priors and assuming that the associated risk is unlikely to be greater than an odds
ratio of 4 (Table 3). The evidence for association of PALB2 was strong with a BFDP of less
than 15% when the prior on the alternative hypothesis is 0.1. The nominally significant
associations for the other three genes are likely to be false positives.

missense variants with minor allele frequency less than 1% in the 54 genes (Supplementary

Table 6). We used the in silico software programs SIFT, Polyphen-2 and Provean to evaluate
the predicted impact of these variants on protein function for each gene. Of the 5,265
variants, 2,111 were classified as ‘deleterious’ based on at least 2 out of 3 of these classifiers.
We found weak evidence for association with increased EOC risk for rare missense variants
in DUOX1 and PAK4 using burden testing (P= 0.015 and 0.025 respectively); for DUOX1 the
strength of this association improved when the analyses were restricted to the HGSOC
histotype (P=0.0061). When we performed the same analyses for 1493 very rare variants
(MAF<0.001), we observed significant association for missense variants in DUOX1 and

FANCE (P=0.015 and 0.034 respectively).

DISCUSSION
We have evaluated the association between putative deleterious variants in 54 genes with
the risk of HGSOC through a combination of whole exome and targeted sequencing analysis
in 5,951 cases and 6,115 controls of broad European ancestries. We found evidence for four
genes - PALB2, POLK, SLX4 and FBXO10 – associated with HGSOC risk. Association analysis in
an additional 13,228 ovarian cancer cases and 28,660 controls genotyped through OCAC and
the UK Biobank provided further support for PALB2 as a HGSOC susceptibility gene.
The probability that a genetic association deemed statistically significant is a false positive
depends on the prior of the null hypothesis and the power of the study to detect an effect
size plausible under the alternative hypothesis. We calculated Wakefield’s BFDP[37] based
on several different priors to further evaluate the likelihood that PALB2, POLK, SLX4 and

FBXO10 are EOC susceptibility genes. If we assume the prior on the alternative to be 1 in 10
or 1 in 20, the BFDPs for the association of deleterious variants in PALB2 with HGSOC are

0.14 and 0.26 respectively. These moderately strong priors are reasonable given the
evidence for the association from previously published studies[19]. Two studies have
reported nominally significant associations for PALB2 with odds ratios of OR 4.4 (95% CI 2.1
– 9.1) [19]; and (2.87, 95% CI 1.61 – 4.74)[20]. Kotsopoulos and colleagues reported an
increased risk that was not significant (OR, 4.55, 95% CI 0.76 – 27), and, in a subset of the
samples included in this study, we also found a non-significant increase in risk (OR 3.2,
95%CI 0.86 – 12)[3].
We lacked the statistical power to identify susceptibility genes conferring relative risks of
less than 2 (Figure 1). Our use of targeted sequencing and a definition of deleterious
variants as those that likely truncate the protein product will have probably underestimated
the true prevalence of deleterious variants in these genes. Incomplete coverage of each
gene will have missed some small indels and single nucleotide variants. Amplicon based
sequencing will also miss large deletions and rearrangements, which are relatively common
in some genes [38 39]. Finally, any functional mutations in the non-coding region of these
genes will have been missed [40].

Some commercial gene-panel tests for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer already include
PALB2.

However, whether there is clinical utility in testing unaffected women for

deleterious mutations in PALB2 is not clear given the uncertainties in the risk estimates for
this gene. There is no consensus over the risk threshold at which preventative surgery
should be offered; many cancer genetics clinics in the United Kingdom will refer women if
their predicted lifetime risk of epithelial ovarian cancer is greater than 10 percent. Others
have suggested that the risk threshold should be lower given the low risk nature of the
intervention; prophylactic surgery has been shown to be cost-effective for women at a
lifetime risk of 5 percent. Recent updates to the US National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) Guidelines recommend considering risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy

in carriers of moderate risk genes if the lifetime risk of such mutation carriers exceeds 2.6%.
Based on our data and population data for ovarian cancer incidence in England and Wales in
2016, the cumulative risk of ovarian cancer by age 80 for a carrier of a deleterious PALB2
mutation is 3.2% (Figure 2). Thus, a woman carrying a PALB2 deleterious mutation would
be eligible for prophylactic surgery. However, the confidence intervals for this estimate
range from 1.8% to 5.7%. Very large, well-designed case-control studies will be required to
provide more precise, unbiased estimates of risk suitable for clinical counselling.

carrier compared to population risks for England and Wales, 2016

In summary, we have found relatively strong evidence that deleterious germline mutations
in PALB2 are associated with a moderate increase in the risk of high grade serous ovarian

tested do not predispose to HGSOC. This study highlights the importance of large sample
sizes needed to obtain risk estimates with the precision necessary for clinical use.
