Abstract
Background: Despite its hallmark cutaneous presentation, most Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in Africa is
diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Early diagnosis will only be achievable if patients with KS
present earlier for care. We hypothesized that public awareness about KS can be enhanced through
exposure to common media.
Methods: We developed educational messages regarding early detection of KS for the general African
public portraying a three-part theme: “Look” (regularly examine one’s skin/mouth); “Show” (bring to the
attention of a healthcare provider any skin/mouth changes); and “Test” (ask for a biopsy for definitive
diagnosis). We packaged the messages in three common media forms (comic strips, radio, and video)
and tested their effect on increasing KS awareness among adults attending markets in Uganda.
Participants were randomized to a single exposure to one of the media and evaluated for change in KSrelated knowledge and attitudes.
Results: Among 420 participants, media exposure resulted in increased ability to identify KS (from 0.95%
pre-test to 46% post-test); awareness that anyone is at risk for KS (29% to 50%); belief that they may be
at risk (63% to 76%); and knowledge that definitive diagnosis requires biopsy (23% to 51%) (all p<0.001).
Most participants (96%) found the media culturally appropriate.
Conclusion: Exposure to media featuring a theme of “Look”, “Show”, “Test” resulted in changes in
knowledge and attitudes concerning KS among the general public in Uganda. High incidence and poor
survival of KS in Africa are an impetus to further evaluate these media, which are freely available online.

A result of the intersection between the HIV epidemic and the endemic presence of Kaposi
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, sub-Saharan Africa accounts for over 80% of incident
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) worldwide (1). In East Africa, for example, KS is the most frequently reported
cancer among men and third in women. In spite of the burden of KS in sub-Saharan Africa and its
hallmark presentation on the skin and visible mucous membranes (i.e., in areas where it theoretically can
be detected in an early stage), more than 80% of all KS in sub-Saharan Africa is classified as late-stage at
the time of diagnosis (2-4). Like many cancers, KS diagnosed in advanced stages has worse survival
than early diagnosis (4, 5). Probably more than most cancers, however, detecting KS early in subSaharan Africa could likely largely control the condition. This is because early KS can often be treated
with widely available drugs — the antiretroviral therapy that is used for HIV infection (6). Late-stage KS,
in contrast, is best treated with liposomal anthracyclines or paclitaxel (6), which, because of cost, are
scarcely available.
Because HIV-infected individuals are at particular risk for KS, a natural target to consider for
interventions to enhance early detection of KS in Africa are the numerous primary care facilities that have
arisen to enable the roll-out of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Recent work from Zimbabwe, however, which
provided training regarding early KS detection to frontline clinicians at HIV-dedicated primary care clinics,
increased clinician knowledge but had no effect on stage of patients’ KS at diagnosis (7). In retrospect,
this is unsurprising if providers primarily encounter KS in its late stages, i.e., if patients who develop KS
are unaware of what it is and the importance of seeking immediate care. Although general public
awareness has not been studied, we earlier found that only 7% of HIV-infected patients  the group with
the most at stake regarding KS  had heard of the condition (8).
To address the gap in public knowledge about KS in sub-Saharan Africa and ultimately facilitate
early detection, we endeavored to create an educational message regarding KS and the importance of
early diagnosis that could be disseminated in the community via common media formats. We
subsequently tested whether exposure to the media forms was able to change knowledge and attitudes
regarding KS among adults in the general community.

Materials and Methods

Overall design
Using community-engaged research, we developed an educational message regarding KS and its
early detection and incorporated this message into three common media forms. To determine whether
the message and media forms influenced knowledge and attitudes concerning KS among members of the
general public, we then randomly assigned exposure to the three media forms to adults attending rural
and urban commercial markets in Uganda, whom we assessed with pre- and post-exposure tests.

Development of media
To develop a scientifically sound and culturally appropriate educational message about KS and its
early detection as well as to determine which media forms to use to disseminate the message, we worked
with an international health science communication consultant (Jive Media Africa, South Africa) and used
community-engaged research. Community engagement involved soliciting input from key stakeholders, at
several different stages, including a) patients with KS who had survived the cancer and persons living with
HIV infection; b) healthcare practitioners including primary healthcare providers, community health
workers, and traditional health practitioners; c) community leaders and members of the general public;
and d) local media groups experienced with health message dissemination in Uganda.
We developed an educational message with a three-part theme: “Look”, indicating to perform skin
and mouth examination, either by one’s self or via a partner, to identify any new or unusual skin/mouth
lesions; “Show”, meaning to bring any suspicious skin/mouth lesions to the attention of a healthcare
provider; and “Test”, denoting to ask healthcare providers to perform biopsies for suspicious lesions. We
incorporated this “Look”; “Show”; “Test” theme into storylines featuring fictional and real-life (healthcare
providers and patients with KS) characters finding abnormal skin lesions, presenting the lesions to
healthcare providers, receiving a skin punch biopsy for diagnosis, and initiating treatment for KS. The
message was crafted drawing upon the concepts of the Information–Motivation–Behavioral skills model

(IMB model) (9). To disseminate the message, we chose three common media forms: paper-based multipanel comic strips (Figure 1); radio (i.e., audio) vignettes (https://soundcloud.com/kaposis_sarcoma); and
a short (10-minute) video documentary (https://vimeo.com/224920054). All media were created in English
and the four most commonly spoken local languages (Luganda, Luo, Runyakitara, and Kiswahili).

Evaluation of media
Study population. The target population for our evaluation of the three media forms was the general
Ugandan adult population aged at least 18 years. As an accessible population, we choose to sample
participants from commercial markets. Markets in Uganda are concentrations of multiple open-air
structures where food (especially perishables) and everyday household items are traded. Each market
serves a given approximate geographic area. We chose markets from one predominantly rural district
(Hoima, in western Uganda, defined as 82% rural (10)) and the two most populated urban districts,
Kampala (the capital city) and Wakiso (which surrounds Kampala). In each area, first, we randomly
selected administrative units, and, second, we used local government records of the locations of markets
within these administrative units and randomly chose markets to include in the media evaluation. At each
selected market, no advertising or announcement was made prior to the day of media testing. On the
media evaluation day, we used the markets’ public-address systems as well as one-on-one random
outreach, by local community mobilisers, to inform market attendees about our presence and invite them
to visit our booth to learn more. The initial explanation described our work as a study about health.
Those who responded to the invitation to visit our booth were given more information about what they
were being asked to do, but we did not use the terms HIV/AIDS, Kaposi’s sarcoma, cancer, or ART. We
enrolled consecutive interested volunteers, stratified by gender, seeking an equal number of men and
women. The project received institutional review board approval, and participants provided verbal
informed consent.

Exposure to media. We randomly assigned participants, stratified by gender, to one of the three media
types. The first was the comics which we printed on newspaper-sized hard stock cards. The second was
the video documentary which we showed on hand-held electronic tablets. The third, the radio vignettes,
were administered through hand-held radios. Because we wanted to simulate a single exposure to the
media, participants were only allowed to possess the media for a limited amount of time (ten minutes each
for the comics and radio vignettes and 15 minutes for the video). Illiterate participants assigned to comics
had a research team member read each story once while the participant viewed the corresponding
pictures. Any questions about the material were deferred until after testing was completed.

Main outcome assessment. Our main objective was to describe the change in knowledge and attitudes
concerning KS as a result of being exposed to the media. We determined within-person change by
comparing responses on an interviewer-administered test completed prior to the exposure to the media to
the responses on the same test administered immediately after the exposure. The test questions were
informed by concepts of the IMB model. They covered visual recognition of KS (by showing participants
pictures of KS lesions); knowledge of the causative agent and casual behavioral factors; self-risk
assessment; and health-seeking attitudes regarding KS.

Other variables. The interviewer-administered pre-test also obtained information on age, sex, education
and literacy level, residence, income, and self-reported HIV status.

Statistical analysis. Each item on the questionnaire had a single best specific response according to the
messages covered by the media. For some of the items, additional correct (typically less specific)
responses were also possible. For each item, we determined within-participant change. We determined
the percentage of participants whose responses changed from incorrect on the pre-test to correct on the
post-test; percentage of participants whose responses changed from correct to incorrect, and percentage
whose responses did not change. We performed this analysis for the single best response and,

separately, for all possible correct responses. Statistical significance of the within-participant change was
determined with McNemar’s test. We also evaluated the influence of several factors (age, sex, education
level, residence, and self-reported HIV status) on change in KS knowledge and attitudes after exposure to
the three media forms; the outcome was a change from an incorrect response on the pre-test to a correct
response on the post-test. We used a directed acyclic graph (11, 12) to depict background knowledge
and inform variable selection in the multivariable regression model (Figure 2). All analyses were
performed with Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).

Results
Characteristics of the study population
From February 2017 to January 2018, we examined 420 adults from urban (n=237) and rural
(n=183) Uganda. The median age was 30 years (interquartile range: 24 to 39), and, by design, 50% were
women (Table 1). Half of the participants had attained education beyond primary school level. Literacy,
measured by the ability of participants to comfortably read grade 5-level writing in a language of their
choice, was 67% (Overall literacy in Uganda is 72% (10)). HIV prevalence, based on self-report, was
5.5% which is equivalent to the national prevalence of 6.2% (13).

Baseline awareness of KS and early detection
Before participants were exposed to the media materials, we assessed their knowledge and
attitudes regarding KS. When shown colored photographs of cutaneous and oral macular, plaque, and
nodular KS in different anatomical locations, only 0.95% of participants correctly identified the lesions as
KS (Table 2). While 29% of participants correctly believed that anyone could develop KS, 63%
considered themselves to be at risk for it. The most common four factors participants thought made them
at risk to develop KS were: all people were at risk (22%); a belief that KS is contagious and that they are
at risk by sharing fomites or unknowingly coming into physical contact with people with KS (16%); poverty
(11%); and being sexually active (9.0%) (Figure 3). Even though 60% said they would go immediately to

a healthcare provider in the event of development of lesions like those shown in the photographs on their
skin or mouth, only 23% of participants appreciated that a biopsy (i.e., some technical examination of the
lesion) is necessary to correctly identify the condition.

Changes in knowledge and attitude after exposure to media
Participants were re-tested with the same set of questions immediately after being exposed, via
random assignment, to one of the three media forms. There was a significant increase in the percentage
of participants responding correctly to all but one of the questions posed (Table 2). The largest overall
correct change in performance was in the ability of participants to specifically name KS as the lesions
depicted in the photographs; 46% named KS after media exposure (an absolute increase of +45%
compared to pre-media knowledge). This was also the only question where, across all media types, none
of the respondents who had the correct response at pre-test gave an incorrect response at post-test.
Approximately one-third of all participants correctly changed their responses to the questions asking about
who is at risk for KS (+31% changed to “all people”); what they would do if they saw the lesions
themselves on their skin (+37% changed to “go to a biomedical provider or get a biopsy”); and what is it
that a healthcare provider would do to make the diagnosis of KS (+34% changed to “perform a biopsy”).
In general, there were significant increases in correct responses in each of the comics, video
documentary, and radio vignette-exposed groups.
The smallest but yet still significant change in test performance was in the question which asked
the participants if they considered themselves at risk for KS. After media exposure, 19% of all participants
considered themselves at risk for KS but had not considered themselves at risk prior to media exposure.
The rationale the participants gave for believing themselves to be at risk also changed in comparison to
the pre-media evaluation (Figure 3). Specifically, in the post-test, citing that all people were at risk was
again the most common reason given for the participant believing him/herself at risk, but this was now
claimed by 48% of those believing they were at risk. A belief that KS is contagious decreased to only
being present post-test in 5.0% of participants claiming to be at risk.

Exposure to the media did not, overall, result in any significant change in participants correctly
identifying that KS is caused by a microorganism. This remained the case even when HIV was
considered an acceptable response as a cause of KS along with most specific correct answer (human
herpesvirus 8/Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8/KSHV) and “microorganism”.

Determinants of change in knowledge and attitude after exposure to media
We explored the relationship between various participant characteristics and ability, after media
exposure, to provide correct responses on the post-test. We evaluated these relationships in the context
of three test questions: ability to identify and cite KS by name in response to photographs; knowledge of
who is at risk for KS; and recognition that any suspicious skin or mouth changes should be presented
immediately to a biomedical healthcare provider (Table 3). In adjusted analyses, only two of the
variables, current residence and education level attained, were associated with improved test
performance. While participants residing in urban areas had 49% (95% CI: 22% to 67%; p = 0.002) lower
odds of correctly identifying KS from photographs compared to those residing in rural areas, those in
urban areas had higher odds of correct responses in the other two questions. Having at least secondary
education had higher odds of correctly naming KS compared to having only primary or no formal
education, but education level showed no strong evidence of an association with performance on the
other two questions.

Participants’ assessment of the media materials
When asked about their opinions about the suitability of the educational materials, 93% of
participants were satisfied with the media content and offered no suggestions for improvement. Of the 31
(7.4%) participants who suggested some adjustments, 19% believed that including more photographs of
KS lesions would help reinforce the messages, and 29% requested more information on the causative
agent of KS (Table 4). Only 16 (3.8%) participants reported finding aspects inappropriate for public
consumption.

Discussion
Despite the possibility of remission when diagnosed at an early stage, KS in sub-Saharan Africa is
too often detected at advanced disease states for which available treatment is ineffective. The irony is
exacerbated by most KS presenting on the skin or mouth, areas in which abnormalities should be readily
identified and brought to medical attention. In a community-based sample of Ugandan adults, we found
— at least in part explaining why advanced stage presentation is so frequent — that knowledge about KS
and its early detection was limited. To begin to remedy this, we developed an educational message about
KS targeted to the public. The themes intended to educate the public about the importance of examining
their skin (“Look”); timely presentation to a healthcare provider if abnormalities are found (“Show”), and
asking providers to perform biopsies for definitive diagnosis (“Test”). To disseminate the message, we
incorporated it into three common media forms: comics, radio vignettes, and a video documentary. We
demonstrated that exposure to these media resulted in an increase in knowledge and change in attitude
about KS and its early detection. The messages and modes of delivery were acceptable to the public
thus providing a promising foundation for future comprehensive educational efforts. To our knowledge,
this is the first formal effort to begin to educate the public in Africa about KS.
We found very low knowledge regarding KS in our participants prior to exposing them to the media
materials. Almost no participant could recognize and cite “Kaposi sarcoma”, and less than 50% thought of
it as a cancer. There was also no local terminology or name used to refer to KS. This low level of specific
knowledge in the population has been documented for other cancers in sub-Saharan Africa (14-16).
Although more than half of the participants believed themselves to be at risk for KS, the majority of risk
factors mentioned were incorrect. These explanations for risk included potential for contracting KS from
another person with KS, poverty, and sexual contact, all of which are commonly held beliefs about how
other cancers develop in Africa (17). Although seemingly independent of the ability to name KS or its
causal determinants, we also found that a large fraction of participants were unaware of the need to seek
immediate attention from a biomedical provider if they developed lesions resembling KS. We did not

probe why participants deemed it unimportant to seek immediate medical attention but suspect it is similar
to what has been reported for other cancers in the region. That is, for people who are concerned about
the meaning of such lesions, failure to seek care from a biomedical provider could be because of access
problems including but not limited to transportation, competing work and social responsibilities, reliance
on alternative healthcare (e.g., traditional healers), and use of non-prescription medicines and natural
remedies (18, 19). For others, if lesions are not accompanied by any other symptoms (e.g., pain) or do
not rapidly change, there simply may be insufficient knowledge that new spots on one’s skin may portend
a serious condition. Indeed, studies of late presentation of other cancers in Africa have shown that the
choice to seek help often only arises when symptoms persist or worsen (18-22). Finally, not only was
there substantial disregard for immediate medical attention if lesions resembling KS developed, there was
also scant awareness of the need for biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis.
After a single setting exposure to one of the three media forms, participants exhibited significant
increases in their ability to identify and name KS, recognize that everyone is at risk for KS, state that they
would seek attention from a biomedical provider if they developed lesions resembling KS, and know that a
biopsy is needed to establish a diagnosis. We are unaware of similar educational efforts targeted at the
general public to enhance knowledge about KS, but community-targeted educational efforts have been
implemented for breast and cervical cancer in Africa with demonstrable increases in knowledge (23-25).
While increase in KS knowledge is not a guarantee of change in behaviour, and despite absence of
evidence of analogous clinical impact in other cancers in sub-Saharan Africa, public education is known to
have important effects on health-seeking behaviour on the continent. That is, irrespective of the low level
of education in the much of the general public in Africa, health-related education campaigns can have
substantial impacts. Some successful examples are in HIV disease (26), polio (27, 28), and guinea worm
(29).
One fact that our participants did not learn from our media was the name of the causative agent of
KS — HHV-8/KSHV. This is unsurprising given the technical nature of this term and the low level of
scientific literacy in the general public. We do not, however, feel that this is a shortcoming of our media in
11

that knowledge of the causative organism for KS is unimportant for community residents. Instead, what is
important is, and what we were seeking to accomplish, is for the public to recognise KS, seek immediate
biomedical attention, and request a biopsy for diagnosis.
There are many similarities between KS in Africa and melanoma in other parts of the world (e.g.,
the U.S., Europe, and Australia). Like KS, melanoma clinically features hyperpigmented skin lesions (30)
and has more favourable survival if diagnosed early (31). In the U.S., for example, the most current 5year melanoma survival is >98% for those presenting with lesions of limited depth of invasion (32).
Following documentation of increasing incidence and associated high mortality, public awareness
campaigns for the early detection of melanoma, utilizing radio, television, and print media, begun in the
1970s in Australia (33), the 1980s in the United States (34, 35), and Europe (36, 37). The campaigns are
ongoing and focus on the importance of routine skin self-examination for the appearance of new or
changing hyperpigmented skin lesions and immediate presentation of skin changes to healthcare
providers. In addition to public education, many of these efforts incorporate mass skin screening fairs
and/or routine comprehensive screening skin examinations by primary care providers. Although it is
controversial as to whether any of the intervention packages aimed at promoting earlier melanoma
diagnosis actually reduce the incidence of melanoma-related death (38-44), that they increase early
detection (as evidenced by increased percentage of early stage disease amongst incident cases) (33, 4549) provides proof-of-concept for considering this for KS in Africa. Furthermore, the many lessons
learned in evaluating the effectiveness of these campaigns for melanoma (43, 50-52) also inform how
effectiveness should be assessed for any similar campaign regarding early detection for KS in Africa. We
note that exactly how an intervention campaign for KS in Africa should be constituted requires
considerable more research, but we hypothesize that it would not be feasible to have routine
comprehensive skin examination by healthcare providers. Instead, we speculate that a “bottom-up”
approach focusing mainly on educating the public to be aware of KS, examine themselves and their loved
ones, present immediately to healthcare providers if abnormalities are seen, and request biopsies for
definitive diagnosis is the only feasible and most cost-efficient plan.

The magnitude of learning that our participants exhibited was admittedly modest. We attribute this
to their receiving only a single exposure of one media type. In addition, even in those participants who did
exhibit correct changes in their test performance after media exposure, it is unknown how long knowledge
will be retained from this single exposure and, as noted above, whether it will translate into the desired
behaviour change. It is not our intention, however, to suggest that a single exposure to one media form
will be impactful. Instead, we strongly believe that to cause a meaningful change in behaviour, people will
need to experience multiple exposures to multiple media types over an extended period of time. Directed
discussions of the messages, for example led by Village Health Team members (community health
workers mandated with providing health education in the communities as well as linking to health services
(53)), might add value to a public education campaign.
Our work does have limitations. While commercial markets are known to attract all types of
individuals, we cannot be certain how our participants represent the overall general target population in
Uganda. To mitigate this, we sampled markets in both urban and rural locations, and, furthermore, our
participants’ literacy and HIV infection status mirrored national averages. Because we sought to evaluate
learning from exposure to the media irrespective of reading literacy, our study staff both read the comics
to those who were illiterate and administered the tests to all participants. It is therefore conceivable that
this interaction with staff may have spuriously influenced test performance. To prevent this, staff were
instructed to only read the text of the comics, point to the accompanying pictures, and not provide
additional explanations; pre- and post-tests followed a standardized script with no prompting. Finally,
because the study was only conducted in Uganda, we are uncertain how findings will translate to other
parts of Africa.
In conclusion, the high incidence and poor survival of KS in Africa — mainly due to advanced
stage of disease at diagnosis — are a strong motivation to educate the public about KS and early
detection. Although some will argue that a decline in KS incidence with growing ART availability (54, 55)
lessens urgency, African KS incidence shows no evidence of ever becoming lower than that of melanoma
in resource-replete settings, and yet these regions continue to expend substantial resources in secondary

delivery using common media that can be used as a foundation for educating the public about early KS
detection.

Correct response refers to the current best scientific evidence regarding the question. This is the information which was promulgated in each of the three common media
forms. It is the first response listed below the question. For some questions, we also considered responses closely related to the correct response; these are listed in the
second and third rows.
† % of participants who provided response
‡ % of participants who had “incorrect” response on pre-test and the “correct” index response on post-test. The + symbol indicates positive change in knowledge.
§ % of participants who had index “correct” response on pre-test and “incorrect” response on post-test. The - symbol indicates negative change in knowledge.
¶ p value for within-subject change from McNemar’s test
** Limited to N=119 participants: 40 randomized to comics, 40 to video, and 39 to radio vignettes. The question was incorporated in a later version of the pre- and post-test.
