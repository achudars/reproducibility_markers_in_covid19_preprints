Abstract
Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of radiomics signatures
derived from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) in patients with
colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods: From April 2008 to Jan 2014, we identified CRC patients who underwent

F-FDG-PET

18

before starting any neoadjuvant treatments and surgery. Radiomics features were extracted from the
primary lesions identified on 18F-FDG-PET. Patients were divided into a training and a validation set
by random sampling. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression
model was applied for prognostic signature building with progression-free survival (PFS) using the
training set. Using the calculated radiomics score, a nomogram was developed, and the clinical utility
of this nomogram was assessed in the validation set.
Results: Three-hundred-and-eight-one patients with surgically resected CRC patients (training set
228 vs. validation set 153) were included. In the training set, a radiomics signature called a rad_score
was generated using two PET-derived features such as Gray Level Run Length Matrix_Long-Run
Emphasis (GLRLM_LRE) and Grey-Level Zone Length Matrix_Short-Zone Low Gray-level Emphasis
(GLZLM_SZLGE). Patients with a high-rad_score in the training and validation set had shorter PFS.
Multivariable analysis revealed that the rad_score was an independent prognostic factor in both
training and validation sets. A radiomics nomogram, developed using rad_score, nodal stage, and
lymphovascular invasion, showed good performance in the calibration curve and comparable
predictive power with the staging system in the validation set.
Conclusion: Textural features derived from
stratification of prognosis in patients with CRC.

F-FDG-PET images may enable more detailed

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in women and the third most common
in men, worldwide [1]. CRC is one of the major causes of cancer-related death [2, 3]. Surgery and
adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy specific for rectal cancer are regarded as standard
treatments. Currently, appropriate treatment for CRC is planned based on the results of preoperative
imaging studies. When CRC is confirmed pathologically, usually via an endoscopic procedure, staging
abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) or chest CT are used next for detection of distant
metastases. For rectal cancer patients, adding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could afford more
accurate local staging, and thus could provide additional information in deciding preoperative
chemoradiotherapy (preop-CRT) [4]. However, if systemic metastasis is definitely confirmed via an
abdominopelvic or chest CT, adding 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography
(PET) or

F-FDG-PET/CT for further clinical decision is controversial. Some studies have

18

demonstrated that conventional PET-derived parameters, such as maximum standardized uptake
value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), carry their own
significance in stratifying survival of patients with CRC [5-8]. However, other studies yielded
equivocal results [9, 10]. The prognostic impact of those conventional PET-based parameters was
not evident for patients with CRC, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
recommended that

F-FDG-PET or PET/CT should be used selectively for potentially surgically

18

curable metastatic diseases or should only be used to evaluate an equivocal finding on a contrastenhanced CT or MRI [11]. Thus, it is necessary to explore the additional clinical efficacy of PET scan in
the management of CRC.

Radiomics has frequently been adopted for subtype classification, evaluation of lymph node
metastasis or distant metastasis, and prediction of treatment response or prognosis in many types of
cancers [12-15]. It is regarded as somewhat difficult to assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity using a
single spatially-biased biopsy [16]. Detection of unseen information reflecting intra-tumoral
heterogeneity might be the main motivation for applying a radiomics approach in the oncology field.
Several studies have investigated the practicality of using

F-FDG-PET radiomics in CRC patients.

18

Primarily, baseline textural features, such as homogeneity, coarseness, dissimilarity and contrast
from the neighborhood intensity-difference matrix, kurtosis of the absolute gradient, and coefficient
of variation of SUV, have analyzed as the prognostic factors for survival and as a predictor of
response to preop-CRT in patients with rectal cancer [17-20]. Nevertheless, because CRC refers to
both the cancer inside the rectum (rectal cancer) and that inside the colon (colon cancer),
application of baseline 18F-FDG-PET signatures as a prognostic factor in CRC patients who underwent
curative intent resection followed by selective chemotherapy has been seldom reported.
Thus, we aimed to identify quantitative 18F-FDG-PET-based imaging biomarkers, using a radiomics
approach, to predict survival outcomes in patients with CRC.

Materials and methods
Study population
We retrospectively reviewed clinical information and radiological images of patients with CRC who
underwent curative-intent resection at Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of
Medicine, between April 2008 and January 2014. Patients with CRC who underwent 18F-FDG-PET as a
preoperative diagnostic modality were initially selected. Inclusion criteria were biopsy-proven
primary CRC, 18F-FDG-PET used as the initial baseline diagnostic tool before starting any neoadjuvant
treatment, within 2 months of surgery, and the availability of follow-up data and clinical information.

Exclusion criteria were PET images unsuitable for further analyses, PET images taken outside of our
hospital, and presence of a lesion that was not identifiable or features that were not extractable
from PET images. Patients whose metabolic tumor volume less than 5.0 mL were also excluded
because these lesions could be affected by partial volume effects. [21, 22] A total of 381 individuals
(224 men; age, 22–88 years) who had stage I-IV CRC and underwent surgery were included in this
study.
This study was approved by the institutional review board of Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei
University College of Medicine (Seoul, Republic of Korea) (approval no. 3-2018-0177). The need to
obtain informed consent was waived for this retrospective study.

PET/CT protocol
All patients fasted for at least 6 hours before the PET/CT scan and had blood glucose levels less than
140 mg/dL before intravenous administration of 18F-FDG (5.5 MBq/kg of body weight). Sixty minutes
after intravenous administration of

F-FDG, PET/CT scans were performed with a hybrid PET/CT

18

scanner (Biograph 40 TruePoint or Biograph mCT 64, Siemens Healthcare Solutions USA, Inc.,
Knoxville, TN). Whole-body CT images were obtained first for attenuation correction using automatic
dose modulation with a reference of 40 mA and 120 kV without contrast enhancement. Then, PET
data were acquired from the skull base to the proximal thigh for 3 minutes per bed position in threedimensional mode. PET images from the mCT 64 scanner were reconstructed using the orderedsubset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with the point spread function (PSF), time of
flight (TOF) modeling, and a 5-mm Gaussian post-filtering process (21 subsets and 2 iterations). For
reconstructing the PET images from the Biograph 40 scanner, only the OSEM algorithm with a 5-mm
Gaussian post-filtering (8 subsets and 4 iterations) was used. Through regular standardization and

quality assurance using a phantom, difference in the measurements of the standardized uptake value
(SUV) between the two scanners was minimized to less than 10%.

Feature extraction for radiomics analysis
A primary volume of interest (VOI) of

F-FDG-PET was manually drawn around the tumor,

18

avoiding physiological FDG uptake, particularly at both urinary tracts. In cases of patients with stage
IV CRC, the primary lesion of the colon or rectum were considered, rather than the metastatic foci.
The relevance of these manually delineated initial VOIs were assessed before performing further
automatic segmentation. The final VOI of the primary tumor lesion was (semi-)automatically defined
on PET images with a threshold of 40% of the SUVmax.
Forty-seven quantitative features from VOIs of each patient’s PET image were extracted using
LIFEx software, which is currently an open source software (http://www.lifexsoft.org) [23].
Algorithms used to obtain histogram-based, shape and size, and second and high order features are
illustrated in the Supplementary file. Conventional parameters, such as SUVmax, SUVmean, and MTV
were measured from the final VOI. TLG was calculated by SUVmean x MTV.
Initially, the inter-observer agreement of the features extracted by a nuclear medicine boardcertified physician and a single trained physician, both blinded to the patients’ clinical outcomes, was
measured using a sample of 43 patients randomly selected from our cohort. After comparing the
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for these two readers, further measurements of the remaining
cases were done by the single trained physician.

Feature selection, building of rad_score, and validation

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.27.19015982; this version posted December 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this

Patients were allocated to training and validation sets using random sampling at a ﬁxed ratio; 60%
of the patients were assigned to the training set and the remaining 40% were assigned to the
validation set. The percentages were selected by considering the event numbers in each group.
The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, in the context of a Cox
model, was applied to implement a meaningful feature selection scheme, based on the association
of every feature with progression-free survival (PFS) of patients in the training set [24]. Because the
values obtained in the initial stage had diverse ranges, we standardized the feature values for the
LASSO regression. Thus, a combination of feature variables, called the rad_score, could be generated.
The steps for extracting those features used in the rad_score calculation are explained in the
Supplementary file. The “glmnet” package was used to perform the LASSO Cox regression analysis.
After generating the rad_score using the LASSO COX regression model in the training set, the
optimum cut-off point of the rad_score was selected on the basis of the association with PFS of
patients in the training set, using X-tile software (Version 3.6.1, Yale University School of Medicine,
New Haven, CT) [25]. The optimal cut-off value was defined as the value that produced the largest
χ2 in the Mantel–Cox test and patients were divided into the high- and low-risk subgroups based on
this value. This cut-off value for rad_score in the training set was applied to the validation set, to
explore the potential association of the rad_score with PFS. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards
model was applied to identify the potential of the rad_score as an independent prognostic biomarker
in the training set, the validation set, and the overall (training + validation) set.

Development and validation of the radiomics nomogram
To confirm the prognostic impact of using the rad_score in a clinical setting, the radiomics
nomogram was generated using the training set and was then validated in the validation set. The
radiomics nomogram was composed of the radiomics signature and independent clinicopathologic

predictors, based on the multivariable Cox regression analysis. The Akaike information criterion (AIC)
and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) were used to compare the performance between the
radiomics nomogram and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage in the training set,
the validation set, and the overall set.
Calibration curves, which compared the predicted survival with the actual survival, were generated
to explore the performance characteristics of the developed nomogram in the validation set.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 23.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and R
version 3.5.1 (R-project, Institute for Statistics and Mathematics, Vienna, Austria). Continuous data
were described as the mean ± standard deviation and were analyzed using the Student’s t test or
Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical data were analyzed using Pearson’s Chi square test or Fisher’s
exact test for dichotomous parameters.
All radiomics features obtained from baseline PET examination were normalized by transforming
the data into new scores with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. PFS was defined from the
date of surgery until the date of recurrence detection, last follow-up, or death. The patients alive at
last follow-up were censored. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to construct survival curves and
the log-rank test was used to compare survival rates between the groups.
A univariable analysis was performed to calculate the hazard ratio of the single variables in the Cox
Proportional-Hazard model after entering one of the variables under investigation in the calculation
model. After calculating all hazard ratios in the univariable analysis, the parameters which showed
statistical significance (p<0.05) or potential significance (p<0.1) were further used in the
multivariable analysis. Multivariable survival analyses with forward stepwise selection were

performed using the Cox Proportional-Hazard model to test the independent significance of different
factors.
The coefficients of the multivariable Cox regression model in the training set were used to
construct a nomogram with the "rms" package of R software. The calibration curves were used to
evaluate the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. The AIC and C-index were calculated to compare
the radiomics nomogram and AJCC stage. A smaller AIC value indicated a better goodness-of-fit for
predicting outcomes and a higher C-index value indicated a better concordance of survival times [26,
27]. A two-sided p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Patient characteristics
Three-hundred-and-eighty-one patients were included in our analysis. There were 43 recurrences
after a mean follow-up period of 36.4 months (interquartile range, 27–60 months). Our initial cohort
was categorized into two groups by random sampling at a ﬁxed ratio; 228 patients (60%) were
assigned to the training set and the remaining 153 patients (40%) were assigned to the validation set.
There were 25 and 18 recurrences in the training and validation sets, respectively.
Patient characteristics in the training set and the validation set are shown in Table 1. Except for the
lymphovascular invasion (LVI) rate, there were no statistically significant differences in
clinicopathologic findings between the training set and validation set. There was no significant
difference in the mean and standard deviation of rad_score between the two groups.
Analysis of the interobserver agreement of the features extracted from PET images yielded a mean
ICC value, for the 47 radiomics features, of 0.932 (range, 0.78–0.99) (Supplementary file).

Radiomics signature-based prediction model
Two features, Gray Level Run Length Matrix_Long-Run Emphasis (GLRLM_LRE) and Grey-Level Zone
Length Matrix_Short-Zone Low Gray-level Emphasis (GLZLM_SZLGE), with coefficients of 0.07079258
and 0.11149516 respectively, were selected in the LASSO Cox regression model. The rad_score was
defined as 0.07079258 × GLRLM_LRE + 0.11149516 x GLZLM_SZLGE. (Supplementary file).
The median rad_score was -0.0495 (range, -0.1394 to 1.4635). The optimum cut-off value
generated by the X-tile program was 0.07 (Supplementary file). Using this value, patients were
classified into a high-risk group (rad_score ≥ 0.07) and a low-risk group (rad_score < 0.07). In the
training set, the rates of histological grade 3 and mucinous type were significantly higher in the high
risk-group than in the low-risk group. The rate of rectal cancer in the high-risk group was marginally
higher than that in the low-risk group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance
(p=0.065). There was no difference of pT, pN, and AJCC stage between the high- and the low-risk
groups (Table 2). The Kaplan–Meier curve showed that the radiomics signature was significantly
associated with PFS in the training set (p<0.001) and in the validation set (p=0.008) (Fig. 1).
Univariable analysis demonstrated that LVI, pN, AJCC stage, and rad_score were significantly
associated with PFS (all p<0.05) (Table 3), while complications (p=0.055), histological grade (p=0.08),
and pT (p=0.052) showed marginal significance. Variables with p<0.1 in the univariable analysis (LVI,
pN, AJCC stage, rad_score, complications, histological grade and pT) were altogether entered into the
multivariable Cox proportional hazard model.
In the multivariable analysis with forward selection, presence of LVI (hazard ratio [HR] 3.73; 95% CI,
1.63–8.47; p=0.001), pathological node-positivity (HR 2.52; 95% CI, 1.01–6.26; p=0.046), and a high
rad_score (HR 7.82; 95% CI, 2.36–25.85; p<0.001) remained independent predictors of a worse
prognosis in the training set. The rad_score was also identified as an independent prognostic factor
in the validation and the overall set (Table 4).

Calibration and discriminative performance measurement of radiomics nomogram
A radiomics nomogram was established using three variables selected in the stepwise multivariable
analysis in the training set (Fig. 2). Table 5 shows the comparison of the C-index and AIC between the
radiomics nomogram and the AJCC stage. In the validation set, the radiomics nomogram showed
higher fitness for AIC than that in the AJCC stage (154.19 in model 4 vs. 156.861 in model 3).
Radiomics nomogram and the AJCC stage showed similar predictive power of C-index after 1000
times bootstrapping of the data (0.715; 95% CI [0.561-0.874] in model 4 vs. 0.62; 95% CI [0.5160.705] in model 3; p=0.101).
The calibration curve of the radiomics nomogram for estimating PFS showed good agreement
between prediction and observation in the validation set (Fig. 3).

Comparison of survival within the same stages based on the rad_score
Kaplan-Meier curves for the subgroups stratified according to the radiomics signature (high-risk
group versus low-risk group) revealed significantly poor PFS of high-risk groups in stage II (p=0.031)
and stage III patients (p<0.0001) respectively (Fig. 4).

Discussion
In the present study, we developed and validated a radiomics nomogram using preoperative 18FFDG-PET images for personalized prediction of PFS in patients with CRC. This study demonstrated
that the features derived from baseline PET could help stratify patients’ prognosis and the radiomics
nomogram showed comparable performance to AJCC stage for predicting PFS in patients with CRC.

Radiomics analysis with PET has been recently investigated for patients with CRC. Bundschuh et al.
reported that the coefficient of variation of SUV correlated with PFS [17]. Bang and colleagues
demonstrated that textural features, including kurtosis of the absolute gradient, measured before
starting preop-CRT, was associated with 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) [18]. Lovinfosse and
colleagues revealed that homogeneity and coarseness were associated with DFS and dissimilarity
and contrast from the neighborhood intensity-difference matrix were correlated with overall survival,
respectively [19]. Nonetheless, previous studies investigating the impact of radiomics derived from
PET mainly focused on patients with rectal cancer, who underwent preop-CRT, and included a
relatively small number of patients and no validation set [17-19]. The impact of PET-based signature
analysis in patients undergoing curative-intent radical surgery, with or without chemotherapy, has
not been extensively investigated to date.
A radiomics signature-based nomogram has been developed and validated for preoperative
prediction of survival in breast cancer, gastric cancer, and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer
patients [28-30]. In our study, the developed nomogram incorporated a radiomics score derived
from two components of the PET-based features, pN and LVI. Both are well-known
clinicopathological prognostic factors in CRC patients [31-33]. Unexpectedly, AJCC stage was not
identified as a significant factor in our multivariable COX proportional hazard model. Our study
included patients who underwent surgeries first, with curative-intent, even in patients diagnosed as
stage IV. Therefore, overall prognosis of stage IV patients in this study might be better than that of
commonly reported stage IV groups that included initially unresectable patients, which might be the
main reason for the greater prognostic power of node-positivity than stage itself, considering
multicollinearity.
The radiomics signature, which was used to divide the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups,
was not related to pT, pN, and AJCC stage in the training set. In addition, the patient’s PFS in stage II
and stage III CRC could be stratified according to the radiomics signature. Collectively, these findings

suggested that the radiomics signature might have different uses, compared to clinicopathological
parameters, in predicting prognosis of patients with CRC, which may be an advantage in applying this
image biomarker. In the current clinical setting, estimating prognosis and using chemotherapy with
appropriate selection of chemotherapy agents are mainly dependent on the postoperative
pathological stages. Wide variations in survival among patients with the same AJCC stage are already
well-known in patients with CRC [34, 35]. Prognostic biomarkers may help to select patients at high
risk of recurrence, allowing customization of the follow-up monitoring process for the individual
patient. The detection of circulating tumor (ct) cells or ctDNA after surgery may provide good
sensitivity and specificity, although such a test would have to be compared with CEA-based detection
of tumor recurrence [36-39]. Patients with a high risk of recurrence may be good candidates for
liquid biopsy-based follow-up; this would be a more reasonable approach in the context of medical
resource use, considering the additional cost imposed by liquid biopsies. Preoperatively, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy prior to surgery has been investigated as an option for treatment, especially for locally
advanced, operable colon cancer patients [40, 41]. In this context, proper risk stratification prior to
definite surgery may be essential for selecting candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our study
demonstrated that PET-based radiomics analysis could enhance patient stratification and thus could
be a potential way for guiding personalized care before or after surgery in CRC patients, although the
contribution of this approach would need to be validated in future.
There were several limitations in the present study. Placement of the VOI was done by manual
selection of the entire lesion, which was a time-consuming and labor-intensive task in some cases.
Although our study revealed that combination of two baseline features derived from PET could be
used as a useful image biomarker, the biological underpinnings of this correlation were not
evident [42]. Moreover, previously identified PET-derived radiomics features, such as coefficient of
variation of SUV, kurtosis of the absolute gradient, homogeneity and coarseness, and the
dissimilarity and contrast from the neighborhood intensity-difference matrix, which were proven to

be important prognostic factors especially in patients with rectal cancer, were not reproducible in our
radiomics signatures. [17-19] The discordance of the results across studies might not be easily
understood and the explanation is likely to be multifactorial. First, various computer algorithms have
been used for feature extraction, and the types of features extracted by each algorithm were not
uniform. Moreover, we applied standardization of features as a preprocessing step before entering
the data into the LASSO COX model, following a method that has already been adopted for radiomics
analysis in patients with breast or gastric cancer [28, 30]. However, most previous studies of PETderived radiomics analysis in patients with CRC did not use standardization as a preprocessing
step [17-19, 43]. The effect of this preprocessing needs to be investigated with more clinical data.
Second, accurate tumor segmentation remains challenging, and there is no standard or
recommended method even for radiomics analysis of PET, although the ICC value was relatively high
in our study. Third, several studies attempted to determine relatively robust features that could
minimize the radiomics feature variations using PET imaging [44-46]. Although robust feature
identification and standardization might be essential, the results of those studies are also somewhat
inconsistent. Different settings for evaluation of the radiomics features, such as using phantom
versus real patients’ data, absence of features with the same names, and different sources of
variability and statistical assessment of robustness, make it difficult to compare the results between
the studies [46]. Finally, the differences in imaging protocols of different PET/CT systems might
potentially hinder the robustness of feature extractions. Therefore, for greater acceptance of
radiomics in clinical decision making, correlation and correspondence among different imaging
protocol is an important step. We considered that all of these situations might be common
limitations in the overall application of PET-derived radiomics in the oncology field. Due to the
retrospective design of the study, genomic data, such as MSI or KRAS data, were not available for all
patients and thus could not be included in the multivariable analysis as an important genetic
biomarker. However, the prognostic or predictive value of these genetic mutations in CRC have
previously shown some contradictory results [47]. It may be difficult to generalize our results

because the study was performed in a single institution, included a relatively small number of
patients, and used only an internal validation set. In addition, although our radiomics nomogram
showed good calibration in the validation set, this did not improve the predictive accuracy for
survival as compared with the AJCC stage. Thus, we believe that our newly developed radiomics
nomogram cannot replace the currently used staging-based strategy; however, our radiomics
nomogram can be used to effectively discriminate patients’ survival within the same stage of CRC.
Although further studies may be required to confirm our results, this study could be used as a proofof concept of the potential use of this approach in clinical practice.
In conclusion, texture analysis from PET images yield prognostic information about PFS in CRC
patients. Assessing these radiomics data during the baseline diagnostic stage may assist in predicting
long-term outcomes. The reproducibility of our feature-based prediction model should be evaluated
in further large-scale studies.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier plot in the training and the validation set according to the high risk and low
risk group
: Kaplan–Meier survival analyses according to the rad_score for patients in the training (A) and the
validation set (B). The Kaplan–Meier curve showed that the radiomics signature was significantly
associated with PFS in the training set (p<0.001) and in the validation set (p=0.008).

Figure 2. Developed nomogram to predict survival using the training set
: Drawing a vertical line to the points' axis from specific variable could determine how many points
toward the probability of PFS the patient receives. The process was repeated for each variable such
as LVI, N stage and rad_score, and the points for each of the risk factors were added. The final total
was then located on the Total Points axis.

Figure 3. Calibration curve of radiomics nomogram in the validation set
: Calibration curves for the radiomics nomograms of PFS in the validation set for agreement between
the estimated and the observed 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS. Nomogram-estimated PFS is plotted on the xaxis; the observed PFS is plotted on the y-axis. The validation set was divided into two groups
according to the survival duration; nomogram-estimated PFS and observed PFS based on the 1-, 2-,
and 3-year PFS were calculated in each group. The diagonal dotted line represents the optimal
estimation of PFS by an ideal model, in which the estimated outcome perfectly corresponds to the
actual outcome. The solid lines with black, gray, and blue colors represent the performance of the
nomogram. A close alignment with the diagonal dotted line indicates better estimation.

PFS, progression-free survival

Figure 4. Comparison of progression-free survival of the high- and low-risk groups defined by
radiomics signature according to the stages in the overall (training + validation) set
: Kaplan–Meier survival analyses according to the radiomics signature (high-risk group versus low-risk
group) in the stage II (A), stage III (B) and stage IV patients (C). The Kaplan–Meier curve showed that
the radiomics signature was significantly associated with PFS in the stage II (p=0.031) and in the stage
III patients (p<0.0001) respectively.
