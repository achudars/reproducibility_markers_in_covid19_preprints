Abstract (word count = 250)

27
28

HIV infection affects up to 30% of children presenting with severe acute malnutrition (SAM)

29

in Africa and is associated with increased mortality. Children with SAM are treated similarly

30

regardless of the presence of HIV although mechanisms of nutritional recovery in HIV and/or

31

SAM are not well understood. We aimed to test the hypothesis that metabolic and

32

inflammatory perturbations among children with SAM differed between those with HIV (n =

33

54) and without HIV (n = 113) to better understand their specific nutritional and therapeutic

34

requirements. We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and plasma proteomics

35

data among children with complicated SAM in Kenya and Malawi. Compared to children

36

with SAM without HIV, HIV-infected children had evidence (false discovery rate corrected

37

p<0.05) of metabolic stress, including enriched pathways related to inflammation and lipid

38

metabolism. Moreover, we observed reduced plasma levels of zinc-α-2-glycoprotrein,

39

butyrylcholinesterase, and increased levels of complement C2 resembling findings in

40

metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. HIV was also associated

41

(false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) with higher levels of plasma chemokines: MCP1,

42

CCL4, GCSF, IL1b, TNFa, IL-2, 5, 7, 8 and 15, IL12p40, IP-10, and IL-1RA. Considering

43

evidence of biomarkers of metabolic stress in children with HIV and SAM, it is of potential

44

concern that our current treatment strategy for SAM regardless of HIV status involves a high-

45

fat therapeutic diet. The results of this study indicate a need for clinical trials of therapeutic

46

foods that meet the specific metabolic needs of children with HIV and SAM.

Introduction

50

Malnutrition, specifically undernutrition in all its forms, remains a global public health burden

51

that accounts for 45% of all death among children under 5 years old [1]. Despite careful

52

monitoring and adherence to guidelines set by the World Health Organization, although in

53

general, uncomplicated SAM cases treated in the community do well, up to 25% of children

54

with complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) treated in a hospital environment do not

55

survive [2-5]. Furthermore, about one in five children treated for complicated SAM and

56

discharged alive, die in the first year after discharge in low-resource settings [6-8]. However,

57

our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the poor prognosis for these children is

58

surprisingly limited.

59
60

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a common co-morbidity of SAM

61

in sub-Saharan Africa affecting up to 30% of admissions among SAM cases [9]. HIV-infected

62

or exposed children are significantly more likely to be stunted, wasted, and underweight [10].

63

They also more often present with other clinical complications and greater susceptibility to

64

infections, thus further complicating their clinical management, which may include providing

65

more aggressive antimicrobial therapy and higher caloric nutritional intervention [11].

66

Moreover, response to clinical management is also less predictable and less well-understood

67

in HIV-infected children compared to their uninfected counterparts [12]. Although acute

68

opportunistic infections play a key role in the outcome of these children, intestinal pathology

69

including inflammation and malabsorption, and metabolic perturbations may also be present.

70

However, mechanisms driving poor nutritional recovery of children with HIV even when

71

detected co-morbidities are treated remain poorly understood [12].

73

We hypothesised that inflammatory, metabolic and other pathways which are likely to be

74

involved in the response to infection, survival and nutritional recovery differ between children

75

with SAM with and without HIV. We conducted a secondary analysis of data and biological

76

samples from a randomised clinical trial in Kenya and Malawi [13].

Materials and Methods

79

Patient recruitment and study design

80

This is a secondary analysis of a nested case control study from a randomised controlled trial

81

(NCT02246296), which tested the effect of a lactose-free, low-carbohydrate F75 milk to limit

82

carbohydrate malabsorption, diarrhoea and refeeding syndrome among children hospitalized

83

for complicated SAM at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, Kilifi County

84

Hospital and Coast General Hospital, Mombasa, Kenya [13]. Children aged 6 months to 13

85

years were eligible for enrolment into the trial at admission to hospital if they had SAM,

86

defined as: mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <11.5cm or weight-for-height Z score <−3

87

if younger than 5 years of age, BMI Z score <−3 if older than 5 years, or oedematous

88

malnutrition at any age and had medical complications or failing an appetite test, as defined

89

by WHO guidelines [14]. Children were excluded if they had a known allergy to milk

90

products and did not provide consent. Biological samples were obtained before the children

91

received the randomised treatment irrespective of HIV status. Unless an HIV positive status

92

was documented, HIV status was assessed by offering an antibody test at admission. For this

93

analysis, patients that tested positive on an HIV antibody test were considered HIV(+) and

94

children with missing or declined HIV test were excluded.

95
96

The nested case-control study was designed to investigate inpatient mortality for which

97

proteomic, cytokine, and chemokine data was generated using plasma samples collected at

98

admission during enrolment to the trial. To compare the proteomic profiles between HIV

99

affected and non-affected children with SAM, we used data from a nested case-control study

100

to investigate inpatient mortality during the trial including 79 deaths and 88 children that were

101

clinically stabilized and discharged from the hospital matched by site of recruitment. For this

102

analysis, all observations from the proteomics dataset were included and the analysis was

103

designed to help overcome selection bias, as given in detail below.

104
105

Proteomics, cytokine and chemokine analysis

106

Untargeted proteomics and targeted cytokines and chemokines analysis of plasma samples

107

were performed following methods described previously [15]. The targeted protein panel

108

included: epidermal growth factor (EGF); eotaxin; granulocyte-colony stimulating factor

109

(GCSF); granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF); interferon alpha-2

110

(IFNa2); interferon gamma (IFNg); interleukins 10, 12p40, 12p70, 13, 15, 17A, 1a, 1b, 1RA,

111

2 to 8; interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10); monocyte chemoattractant protein 1

112

(MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha and beta (MIP1a & b); tumour necrosis

113

factor alpha (TNFa) and beta (TNFb); and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

114
115

Data analysis

116

Data analyses were performed using R v3.5 [16]. Analysis of the prevalence of HIV(+),

117

nutritional status and their associations with inpatient mortality utilised the entire trial dataset

118

(N=843). Analysis of categorical data was performed using Fisher’s test and generalised

119

linear models for continuous outcomes. Logistic regression was used to analyse binary

120

outcomes adjusting for age, sex, presence of oedema, and site of recruitment. These

121

associations were also adjusted for MUAC. As a sensitivity analysis to address the possibility

122

of confounding due to HIV maternal antibodies in younger children, a test of interaction

123

between age above or below 18 months and individual proteins towards HIV status was

124

performed.

125
126

The proteomics, cytokines and chemokines analyses were secondary analyses of data

127

collected from a nested case-control study with inpatient mortality as its primary outcome,

128

hence with strong selection bias. The analysis for the association between HIV status and

129

individual proteins was therefore performed usng logistic regression analysis with inverse

130

probability weighting (IPW) to correct for selection bias [17-20]. Weights (w) were calculated

131

as suggested by Samuelsen [18] wherein the weight for each observation selected into the

132

nested case-control study was computed as the inverse of the probability of being selected for

133

the nested study from the main clinical trial. The probability of inclusion was therefore

134

calculated as:

135
136

p(i) =

     …  

;

137

where p(i) is the probability of inclusion in the nested case-control study and x1, x2 … xn are

138

HIV status, sex, age, presence of oedema, mid-upper arm circumference, and site of

139

recruitment of the i-th observation (child) based on the entire trial population. Inverse

140

probability weight is therefore:

141
142

w(i) =

‫݌‬ሺ݅ሻ

143
144

Differences in individual proteins abundances were considered statistically significant when

145

p<0.05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery

146

rate (FDR) [21].

148

Multivariate analysis was undertaken in order to determine several proteins that are

149

collectively associated with HIV status, some of which may not be significantly associated to

150

HIV independently. This was performed using a weighted elastic net (EN) model

151

implemented using the “glmnet” package in R [22]. EN is a penalized regression approach

152

that was developed to help overcome problems caused by high dimensional data. It is an

153

integration of two regularized approaches, ridge regression and least absolute shrinkage and

154

selection operator (LASSO), wherein the contribution of each of these models to the final EN

155

model is controlled by the α parameter [22, 23]. The strong penalization imposed by LASSO

156

draws coefficients to zero thereby eliminating non-predictive proteins features, whereas ridge

157

regression addresses potential multi-collinearity problems in high-dimensional data [22, 23].

158
159

Weighted EN model generation was performed with HIV status as outcome, protein profile as

160

predictors, and w as observation weights. The penalization parameter lambda, which

161

influences the shrinkage of variable coefficients to zero thus eliminating some non-

162

contributing variables, was determined by estimating the area under the receiver operator

163

curve (ROC) of the population using ten-fold cross validation. Several alpha parameter values

164

were assessed and a final value of 0.85 was taken to achieve a compromise between

165

predictive ability and fewer number of features extracted. The final lambda parameter was

166

based on the value which gave the highest area under the ROC (AUROC) value.

167
168

Proteins with significant association with HIV status after correction for false discovery and

169

those extracted by the EN model were then uploaded to The Database for Annotation,

170

Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8 Bioinformatics Resource [24] to assess

171

the Gene ontology (GO) enriched pathways of the differentially expressed proteins.

173

EN model validity was judged based on the AUROC and misclassification error rate. The

174

fitted EN model performance measured as optimism-corrected AUC was validated using

175

bootstrap, following the procedure of Smith et al. [25]. Bootstrapping was performed on 2000

176

iterations using the “BootValidation” package in R. Protein features extracted at least 80% of

177

all iterations by the bootstrap EN model were then considered to be the most relevant protein

178

biomarkers. These proteins were then fitted on a weighted logistic regression with HIV as

179

outcome.

180
181

Visualisation of significantly enriched GO terms

182

Bubble plots were used to visualise the significantly enriched pathways (p<0.05 after

183

adjustment for FDR) obtained from DAVID. The p-values in DAVID were obtained using a

184

modified Fisher’s exact test [26]. The y-axis represents the fold enrichment which indicates

185

the magnitude of the enrichment, as calculated in DAVID. Fold enrichment is defined as:

 

186

 

/
/

,

187

where m is the number of proteins significantly associated with HIV status or proteins

188

extracted by the EN model that belong to a particular pathway, while M is the total number of

189

proteins belonging to the same pathway. Variable n is the number of all proteins significantly

190

associated with HIV status or extracted by the EN model and N is the total number of all

191

proteins in the human background. Therefore, a fold enrichment of 10 indicates that 10% of

192

the proteins significantly associated with HIV status belong to a particular pathway, and 1%

193

of all annotated proteins in the human background belongs to the same pathway [26].

194

However, the proponents of this metric warns that big fold enrichments could be obtained

195

from a small number of proteins, which could be due to small n or pathways with fewer

196

members.

The x-axis on the hand represents the enrichment z-score for a particular pathway [27], which

199

is calculated as follows:

    

200




√ 

;

201

where up is the total number of proteins upregulated, down is the total number of proteins

202

downregulated, and count is the total number of proteins in the input which belongs to a

203

particular pathway. Variables up and down were based on the weighted logistic regression for

204

each individual protein. Hence, if 5 proteins belonging to pathway x were upregulated and 2

205

were downregulated, the z-score for pathway x would be: (5-2)/√7 = 1.13. A positive z-score

206

indicates that the particular pathway is overall upregulated in HIV(+), whereas a negative z-

207

score indicates an overall downregulation [27].

Results

210

Patient characteristics

211

Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the children in the randomised trial. A total of

212

843 complicated SAM children were recruited for the randomised trial, of which 179 (22%)

213

patients were HIV(+). Age was higher and MUAC was lower in HIV(+) children than HIV(-)

214

counterparts. Most HIV cases were found in Malawi. Sex and the presence of oedema were

215

not associated with HIV status. Mortality was more than 2 times higher among in HIV(+)

216

compared to HIV(-) (p < 0.001). Children whose HIV status were unknown had the highest

217

mortality of 34%, which indicates the need for more active HIV screening among children

218

with SAM.

219
220

Among HIV(+), 33% were already under an anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regime: 53/179

221

(30%) on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and 7/179 (4%) on Nevirapine only.

222

About half of the children (90/179) were naïve for ART whereas HIV treatment status was

223

unknown for 16% (29/179). Mortality was not significantly different among children on

224

HAART, ART naïve and children with unknown HIV treatment status (Supplementary Table

225

1).

226
227

HIV is associated with increased inflammatory and immune response, dysregulated lipid

228

metabolism, and increased proteolysis in children with SAM

229

Table 2 shows the characteristics for children included in the proteomics study. Fifty four

230

HIV (+) children were compared to 113 HIV(-) children with SAM. In this sub-population,

231

age was not significantly associated with HIV, and as in the full dataset. HIV(+) children also

232

had significantly lower MUAC and higher mortality than HIV(-) children. There were no

233

significant associations between sex and presence of oedema with HIV status.

234
235

A total of 204 circulating proteins were annotated and compared between children with and

236

without HIV infection. Of these, levels of 42 proteins were found to be significantly

237

associated with HIV status in the initial univariate analysis (Figure 1A) (Supplementary table

238

2). Specifically, HIV(+) was associated with higher circulating levels of immunoglobulins,

239

inflammatory proteins such as calprotectin (S100 calcium binding protein A8 and S100

240

calcium binding protein A9), complement proteins, and proteins related to host response to

241

infection (i.e. lipopolysaccharide binding protein, galectin 3 binding protein and CD5

242

molecule-like protein). Enrichment analysis suggested that HIV(+) children have increased

243

complement activation and immune response, and inflammatory responses than HIV(-)

244

children. Neutrophil aggregation and chemokine production appeared to be the pathways most

245

highly enriched in HIV(+) compared to HIV(-) SAM children. To substantiate these results,

246

we quantified chemokine and cytokine levels in plasma. As shown, most chemokines had the

247

tendency to be associated with HIV infection, where elevated plasma concentration of 12

248

were significantly associated with HIV status in SAM children (Figure 1B), namely:

249

monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta

250

(MIP1b, CCL4), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), interleukin 1 beta (IL1b),

251

tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interleukins 2,5,7, 8 and 15 (IL2 , 5, 7, 8, 15),

252

interleukin 12 subunit beta (IL12p40), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and

253

interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA).

254
255

Out of the 43 differentially expressed proteins, three proteins were found to be negatively

256

associated with HIV status on initial univariate analysis, namely: adiponectin, kininogen-1

257

and peptidase inhibitor 16. Among HIV(+) children, there were no statistically significant

258

associations with receiving HAART (n = 53) compared to ART naïve (n = 90) children (data

259

not shown), although our study may not be powered to observe significant difference for this

260

comparison. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis to address the possibility of HIV maternal

261

antibodies in younger children, showed no significant interaction of age above or below 18

262

months and individual proteins plasma levels towards HIV status.

263
264

The weighted EN model extracted 73 circulating proteins (Figure 2A) that are associated with

265

HIV status with AUROC = 0.97 [95% CI: 0.95 – 0.99] (Figure 2B) and misclassification error

266

rate of 2.4%. Optimism-adjusted validated AUROC after bootstrapping was 0.90 [95% CI:

267

0.90 – 0.90], indicating a robust model. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted that apart

268

from increased immune response, HIV(+) children with SAM have increased proteolysis and

269

lipid mobilisation, specifically increased very low-density lipoprotein assembly, indicating

270

metabolic dysregulation related to cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism among HIV(+)

271

patients (Figure 2D).

273

After 2000 bootstrap iterations during bootstrap validation, 3 proteins were consistently

274

extracted by the EN model >80% of the time (Figure 2E), namely: butyrylcholinesterase

275

(BChE), complement C2 and zinc-α-2-glycoprotein (ZAG), indicating that these 3 proteins

276

are likely to be the most important features associated with HIV in children with complicated

277

SAM. Weighted logistic regression model of these 3 proteins showed good discrimination of

278

HIV status (AUROC = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.74 – 0.87]) (Figure 2F).

279
280

Discussion

281

In this study, we report plasma proteomic differences associated with HIV status, which

282

indicates that HIV imposes additional metabolic and inflammatory insults among HIV(+)

283

children with SAM. Our results show that pathways involved in inflammatory response,

284

complement cascade activation and lipid metabolism dysregulation are associated with HIV

285

status. Levels of several plasma chemokines were also found to be higher in HIV(+) among

286

children with SAM. Greater inflammatory responses in these children could be related to the

287

higher inpatient mortality of HIV(+) compared to HIV(-) children with SAM.

288
289

An earlier metabolomics study in Uganda reported reduced serum levels of adiponectin and

290

leptin, whereas serum triglycerides, ketones and even-chain acylcarnitines were higher in

291

HIV(+) children with SAM indicating perturbed lipid metabolism [28]. Our current study

292

therefore concurs with this finding, as we also found reduced plasma levels of adiponectin in

293

HIV(+) SAM children compared to HIV(-) SAM children, along with upregulation of

294

pathways involved in lipid transport and metabolism, specifically very low-density lipoprotein

295

assembly.

Using optimism-adjusted bootstrap validation of the EN model, we found 3 proteins:

complement c2, BChE and ZAG robustly distinguished HIV(+) from HIV(-) in children with

299

SAM, demonstrating the ability of multivariate analysis techniques, such as EN, to uncover

300

underlying relationships between protein markers which would be difficult to identify when

301

analysed individually. The activation of the complement system during HIV infection has

302

been previously discussed at length, which is associated with the increased cellular invasion

303

of HIV in cells [29-31]. On the other hand, in a recent study in China, low circulating BChE

304

was found to be highly associated with HIV severity, was predictive of mortality in adults,

305

and was proposed as a plausible strategy for severity classification among adults with HIV

306

[32]. BChE is also reported to be reduced in protein-energy malnutrition, stress and

307

inflammation [33]. In animal studies, BChE deficiency was found to strongly affect fat

308

metabolism and promotes hepatic lipid accumulation [34]. Serum BChE levels have been

309

found to have a significant negative correlation with serum total cholesterol and serum low-

310

density-lipoprotein cholesterol among people with diabetes mellitus [35]. Furthermore,

311

reduced plasma levels of ZAG, an adipokine with protective effect against insulin resistance,

312

was previously reported to be implicated in dyslipidaemia in HIV(+) adults under ART

313

treatment [36]. Reduced circulating levels of ZAG has also been found among adults with

314

clinically diagnosed metabolic syndrome, based on guidelines of the United States National

315

Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III

316

criteria [37]. Serum ZAG levels have been reported lower among adults with impaired

317

glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus [38]. Taken together, our results therefore

318

suggest that children with both HIV and SAM children manifest hallmarks of metabolic stress

319

similar to those occurring in metabolic syndrome and other non-communicable diseases

320

(NCD).

322

The results of this study is the first proteomics investigation on the interaction between HIV

323

and SAM, which together with the previously published metabolomics study [28], provides

324

more evidence on the increased metabolic stress and altered metabolic response among

325

children living with both HIV and SAM. Our results also concur with previous studies that

326

reported elevated metabolic stress among non-malnourished adults living with HIV leading to

327

increased prevalence or risk for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and

328

other non-communicable diseases [39-45].

329
330

However, despite our knowledge that HIV-infected populations have altered metabolic

331

requirements compared to HIV-uninfected counterparts, WHO guidelines for the nutritional

332

management for SAM are globally the same regardless of HIV status, which is summarized in

333

Table 3 [46]. Nutritional management for in-patient children with SAM involves provision of

334

a low-protein, low-fat milk-based food, F75, every few hours. F75 is used during clinical

335

stabilization occurring during the first few days after admission and is not intended for weight

336

gain. Once the children are clinically stabilized and are able to tolerate the solute load,

337

children are transitioned to F100, a higher-calorie, high-fat milk intended to boost weight

338

gain. Upon discharge from in-patient care, children are referred to community based

339

nutritional therapeutic centres where they are provided with ready-to-use therapeutic food

340

(RUTF), a peanut-based calorie-dense diet.

341
342

Considering evidence of biomarkers of metabolic syndrome and NCD in HIV(+) children

343

with SAM, it is of potential concern that our current treatment strategy involves a high-fat

344

therapeutic diet. About 50% of much needed calories during the growth catch-up phase are

345

supplied as lipids, which HIV(+) children may not be able to efficiently assimilate.

346

Alterations in lipid metabolism in HIV(+) children with SAM may also mean that the high

347

amounts of dietary lipids could be deposited as ectopic fat in the liver and muscle,

348

predisposing to insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular problems and other NCDs later in

349

life. Although long-term metabolic follow-up studies could be done for HIV(+) children

350

previously treated for either complicated and uncomplicated SAM, significant barriers are the

351

high mortality rate in earlier studies of HIV(+) children with SAM, cost and difficulty tracing

352

them years later. The results of this study indicate a need for clinical trials modifying the

353

composition of F100 or RUTF to meet the specific metabolic needs of HIV(+) children with

354

SAM. This could initially be done in relatively small groups with outcomes that include

355

measuring metabolic stress.

356
357

Several studies on nutritional intervention strategies among HIV-infected adults have been

358

reported. For instance, a study in the USA showed that dietary fat intake, specifically

359

saturated fats, was significantly associated with hypertriglyceridemia among HIV-infected

360

adults (18 – 60 years) [47]. Moreover, in a preclinical model, high saturated fat consumption

361

was found to accelerate immunodeficiency virus disease progression in macaques, specifically

362

increased mortality hazard and circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially

363

IL8 [48], which has been previously reported to be associated with lipodystrophy among HIV

364

patients [49]. In our study, we also found a significant association between high plasma IL8

365

concentration and HIV in SAM children. Hence, modifying the saturated fat composition of

366

the milk-based F75 and F100 could potentially lower metabolic stress.

367
368

Furthermore, the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) gave a grade

369

A recommendation for the use of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-based diet on HIV(+)

370

patients with diarrhoea and severe undernutrition in its 2006 ESPEN Guidelines on Enteral

371

Nutrition [50]. Grade A recommendations are given to strategies based on meta-analysis or at

372

least one randomised control trial. In this case, the recommendation was based on a

373

prospective, randomized double-blind comparative trial on 24 adult patients with HIV and

374

diarrhoea of more than 4-wk duration, fat malabsorption, and loss of 10–20% of ideal body

375

weight [51]. In this study, the authors found improved outcomes from diarrhoea and fat

376

malabsorption from MCT than long-chain triglyceride-based diet among HIV(+) adults.

377
378

Lastly, the long-term metabolic effect of nutritional intervention strategies for SAM still

379

remains unresolved. Most specifically, the potential metabolic stress associated with the rapid

380

weight gain during the nutritional rehabilitation phase after SAM and its implications on

381

nutritional outcomes during adulthood demands urgent research attention, especially for

382

HIV(+) children with SAM.

383
384

Conclusion

385

Plasma proteomics reveals that HIV(+) children with SAM manifest hallmarks of metabolic

386

stress similar to those observed in non-communicable diseases. This could be related to the

387

poor nutritional recovery and high mortality of HIV(+) children with SAM despite clinical

388

and nutritional intervention. The results of this study indicate a need for clinical trials

389

modifying the composition of F100 or RUTF to meet the specific metabolic needs of HIV(+)

390

children with SAM during rehabilitation phase. This could initially be done in relatively small

391

groups with outcomes that include measuring metabolic stress.

Figure 2. (A) Elastic net (EN) regularized regression lambda parameter optimization curve,
optimal lambda parameter was chosen based on the highest area under the receiver operator
curve (AUROC); (B) AUROC (0.97 [95% CI: 0.95 – 0.99]) of the EN model generated using
the lambda parameter, alpha parameter was set to 0.75, final model extracted 34 protein
features; (C) optimism-adjusted bootstrap validation of the generated EN model, validated
AUROC = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.90 – 0.90] using 2000 iterations; (D) Gene entology (GO-terms)
enrichment analysis of proteins extracted by the EN model. X-axis represents z-scores; y-axis,
fold enrichment, and size of the spheres represent the number of proteins involved in the
particular pathway. Gold circles represent pathways enriched in HIV(+) whereas blue circles
are pathways more associated with HIV(-). The grey circle indicate that there are as much
proteins in this pathway that are significantly upregulated and downregulated in HIV. Only
significantly enriched pathways (p < 0.05 after FDR adjustment) are plotted. See main text for
explanation of the plots. Pathways enriched are identified in the table. (E) Log odds ratio plot
