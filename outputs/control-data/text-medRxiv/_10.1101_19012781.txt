ABSTRACT
Background: Population-level estimates of disease prevalence and control are needed to

assess the effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies. However, available data are
often subject to differential missingness. Consider population-level HIV viral suppression:
proportion of all HIV-positive persons who are suppressing viral replication. Individuals with
measured HIV status, and, among HIV-positive individuals, those with measured viral
suppression are likely to differ from those without such measurements.
Methods: We discuss three sets of assumptions sufficient to identify population-level

suppression over time in the intervention arm of the SEARCH Study (NCT01864603), a
community randomized trial in rural Kenya and Uganda (2013-2017). Using data on nearly
100,000 participants, we compare estimates from an unadjusted approach assuming data are
missing-completely-at-random (MCAR); stratification on age group, sex, and community; and,
targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner to adjust for baseline and
time-updated predictors of measurement.
Results: Despite high annual coverage of testing, estimates of population-level viral suppression

varied by identification assumption. Unadjusted estimates were most optimistic: 50% of HIVpositive persons suppressed at baseline, 80% at Year 1, 85% at Year 2, and 85% at Year 3.
Stratification on baseline predictors yielded slightly lower estimates, and full adjustment reduced
estimates further: 42% of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 71% at Year 1, 76% at
Year 2, and 79% at Year 3.
Conclusions: Estimation of population-level disease burden and treatment coverage require

appropriate adjustment for missingness. Even in “Big Data” settings, estimates relying on the
MCAR assumption or baseline stratification should be interpreted with caution.

INTRODUCTION:

Accurate population-level estimates of disease prevalence and treatment coverage are
needed to quantify disease burden and evaluate the success of programs for epidemic control.
The data available to inform such estimates, however, are often susceptible to differential
measurement. In other words, the missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumption rarely, if
ever, holds.1–4 The field of HIV provides an illustrative example. Consider the UNAIDS 90-90-90
target: 90% of all HIV-positive persons should know their status; 90% of those who know their
status should be receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART); and 90% of those receiving ART should
have suppressed HIV viral replication.5 Multiplying these proportions together yields an overall
target, referred to here as “population-level suppression” - 73% of all HIV-positive persons
should be suppressing HIV viral replication (Appendix). This target reflects the HIV care
“cascade” from diagnosis, through treatment initiation and retention, to viral suppression.
While population-level suppression is widely used in assessing HIV care strategies, two
recent systematic reviews noted the variability in both data quality and statistical approaches
used for assessment.6,7 In particular, Granich et al. remarked on the challenges posed by
incomplete data and inconsistent methodology, while Sabapathy et al. proposed a template to
standardize data collection and evaluation. In this manuscript, we provide an in-depth

demonstration of the methods used to estimate population-level suppression in the SEARCH
Study, a cluster randomized trial in rural Kenya and Uganda (NCT01864603).8,9 We approach
the missing data problem with a causal framework to define target parameters with
counterfactuals, state identifiability assumptions sufficient to translate these targets into
statistical quantities, and estimate the resulting statistical parameters.1–4,10–14 We refer the
reader to companion papers for details on the trial.8,9

METHODS:

In general, the total number of HIV-positive persons in a population is unknown, and
individuals for whom HIV status is known are not necessarily representative of the general
population. If testing (e.g. health-seeking behavior) is related to HIV status, unadjusted
estimates of prevalence (i.e. the proportion of those with HIV among those with known status)
are likely to be biased, even in the context of community-wide testing, as was implemented in
recent Universal-Test-and-Treat trials.9,15–18
Likewise, measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels (viral loads) among HIV-positive
individuals is generally incomplete and often depends on factors associated with viral
suppression status. For example, if viral loads are only measured at HIV clinic visits, then viral

suppression among individuals with known status will overestimate suppression among all HIVpositive persons, including newly diagnosed individuals who have not yet linked to care and
previously diagnosed individuals who have never linked or have dropped-out of care. These
familiar missing data challenges can be illustrated with a directed acyclic graph or another
causal modeling approach (Figure 1).14,19–24
Overcoming these challenges requires knowledge of the data generating process.
Consider the 16 communities in the intervention arm of the SEARCH Study. After a door-to-door
census, community-wide testing was conducted annually through multidisease health fairs,
followed by out-of-facility testing for residents who did not attend the fair.25,26 Participants were
linked over successive years with a fingerprint biometric. Prior diagnosis of HIV and ART use
were ascertained through linkage to clinic records.8,27 A re-census was conducted three years
after follow-up to determine interim deaths, out-migrations, and in-migrations.9
With this measurement scheme in mind, we describe the methods used in Petersen et

al.8 and Havlir et al.9 to characterize viral suppression in the intervention arm at the time of
community-wide testing: study baseline t=0, and annually thereafter t={1,2,3}. These crosssectional analyses provide snapshots of population-level suppression among an open cohort of
adult (³15years) residents (allowing for entry due to age and in-migration, and exit due to death

or outmigration). We note estimating viral suppression among a closed cohort of baseline HIVpositive residents is a distinct goal, resulting in a different causal parameter, identifiability
assumption, and estimation approach.8,9
Causal parameters

Let 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ be an indicator that an individual is HIV-positive at time t, irrespective of
whether serostatus is measured. Likewise, let 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ be a possibly unmeasured indicator of HIV
viral suppression (<500cps/mL) at time t. Population-level suppression is the conditional
probability of viral suppression given HIV-positive status: ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ = 1 | 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1), or
equivalently, the joint probability of being HIV-positive with suppression, divided by the
probability of being HIV-positive (i.e. HIV prevalence):

ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ = 1 , 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1)

1ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉 ∗ = 1) .
$

Ideally, anyone not already known to be HIV-positive (i.e. previously HIV-negative or
HIV-unknown) would be tested at time t. Of course, this is never the case; further, missingness
inherently depends on underlying HIV status - the status of an HIV-negative individual who does
not test at t is unknown, whereas the status of an HIV-positive individual not seen at t might be
known from prior testing. The problem is intensified after multiple rounds of community-wide
testing, which provide multiple opportunities for prevalent HIV-positive persons to be diagnosed.
To avoid this inherent dependence, we define 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ as an indicator that an individual was

seen at community-wide testing and had “known” HIV status at time t - due to a negative test
result at time t, or a positive result at or before time t. We define observed HIV status as 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ =
𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ × 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ .
As with HIV testing, viral load measurement is incomplete; HIV-positive persons on
whom a viral load is measured may differ systematically from HIV-positive persons who are
missing a viral load. Define 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ as an indicator of viral load measurement at time t, and
define observed viral suppression as 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ × 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ .

Three sets of identifiability assumptions

In the above, population-level suppression was expressed in terms of underlying
indicators of HIV seropositivity and viral suppression:

ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ = 1 , 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1)

1ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉 ∗ = 1) .
$

We now present three sets of identifiability assumptions to write the numerator and denominator
in this expression as parameters of the observed data distribution.

Unadjusted:
Suppose we are willing to assume that HIV prevalence among those seen at time t is
representative of HIV prevalence among those not seen, and that viral suppression among HIVpositive persons with viral load measurement at time t is representative of suppression among

HIV-positive persons without viral load measurement at that time. More formally, we are making
the following randomization assumptions as applied to missing data:1–4,10–14 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ ⊥ 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ and
𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ ⊥ 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ |𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1. If these assumptions hold, the numerator of population-level
suppression is identified as
ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1) = ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1) × ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1),
and denominator as ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1) = ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1).27 Taking the ratio of these yields
the unadjusted statistical parameter:
ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1).

(Eq1)

Baseline adjustment:
We can weaken the above assumptions by conditioning on baseline covariates.
Specifically, let B denote mutually exclusive and exhaustive strata defined by age group, sex,
and community of residence. Now suppose within each strata b, HIV prevalence among those
seen at t is representative of prevalence among those not seen, and within each strata b,
suppression among HIV-positive persons with viral loads measured at t is representative of
suppression among HIV-positive persons without measured viral loads. More formally, we
assume 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ ⊥ 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ |𝐵 and 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ ⊥ 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ |𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1, 𝐵.

Under these assumptions on missingness, we obtain the G-computation identifiability
result,28 corresponding to a hypothetical, dynamic intervention to first ensure knowledge of HIV
status and then to ensure measurement of viral loads among HIV-positive persons.29–31
Specifically, the proportion of the population that is HIV-positive and suppressed is identified as
ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1) = ∑;

ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1, 𝐵 = 𝑏) ×
ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1, 𝐵 = 𝑏) × ℙ(𝐵 = 𝑏)

(Eq2)

In words, this is the strata-specific probability of viral suppression, given measurement and HIVpositive status; multiplied by the strata-specific probability of being HIV-positive, given
measurement; and then standardized with respect to the distribution of strata. Identification of
the denominator, population-level prevalence, follows from the above:
ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1) = ∑; ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1, 𝐵 = 𝑏) × ℙ(𝐵 = 𝑏)

(Eq3)

By taking the ratio of the numerator (Eq2) to the denominator (Eq3), we obtain a baselineadjusted statistical parameter corresponding to population-level suppression under the above
assumptions.
For the conditioning sets to be well-defined, we also require the positivity
assumption.11,32 Irrespective of age, sex, and community, there must be a positive probability of
being seen with known HIV status ℙ(𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1 |𝐵) > 0, and for every strata in which some

proportion of HIV-positive persons are seen, there must be a positive probability of viral load
measurement, regardless of the stratification factors: ℙ(𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ = 1 |𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1, 𝐵) > 0.

Time-varying adjustment:
While stratifying on certain baseline characteristics weakens our assumptions on
missingness, there may be many other variables potentially impacting the probability of being
tested, underlying HIV status, and viral suppression among HIV-positive persons. In particular,
ART use is a key determinant of viral suppression and may also be predictive of viral load
measurement.
Define 𝐴𝑅𝑇$ as an indicator of ART initiation prior to time t, and let 𝑋$ denote the
remaining observed variables that are potentially predictive of both viral suppression and
measurement: the full set of baseline demographics (e.g. age, sex, marital status, education,
occupation, alcohol use, mobility, wealth index, and community) and prior HIV testing and
suppression. While viral suppression without ART is possible, the UNAIDS target is focused on
ART-induced suppression.5 Therefore, we set 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ to zero for persons not on ART acknowledging that incomplete capture of ART use will lead to underestimation of suppression.
For HIV-positive persons who have initiated ART, we assume that conditional on the baseline
and time-updated covariates 𝑋$ , suppression among those with a viral load measured during

annual testing is representative of suppression among those with a missing viral load. More
formally, we assume 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ ⊥ 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ | 𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝑋$ .
We also require the positivity assumption; all HIV-positive individuals who have initiated
ART have a positive probability of having their viral load measured, regardless of their baseline
and time-updated covariates: ℙ(𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ = 1 |𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝑋$ ) > 0 a.e.. Under these assumptions,
we have the G-computation identifiability result corresponding to a hypothetical intervention to
ensure viral load measurement among ART initiators:28
ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$∗ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1)
= ℙ(𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1)
× A[ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1|𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑉𝐿$ = 1, 𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝑋$ = 𝑥$ ) × ℙ(𝑋$ = 𝑥$ |𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1)]

(Eq4)
where the summation generalizes to an integral for continuous covariates. In words, this is the
proportion of individuals who have started ART (and are, by implication, HIV-positive) in the total
population (including both HIV-positive and HIV-negative persons) multiplied by the adjusted
probability of being suppressed and measured, given prior ART initiation.
For the denominator of HIV prevalence, we also consider an expanded adjustment set
𝐿$ , consisting of all baseline demographics and prior HIV testing (e.g. number and location). For
the subgroup without a prior HIV diagnosis, we assume that conditional on 𝐿$ , HIV prevalence
among those tested at t is representative of HIV prevalence among those not tested, or more

formally, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ ⊥ 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ | 𝐿$ , 𝐻𝐼𝑉$GH = 0. We further assume positivity; previously undiagnosed
persons have some chance of being tested regardless of their 𝐿$ values:
ℙ(𝑇𝑠𝑡𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1 |𝐻𝐼𝑉$GH = 0, 𝐿$ ) > 0 a.e.. Under these assumptions, we have the G-computation
identifiability result corresponding to a hypothetical intervention to ensure HIV status is known:28
ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$∗ = 1) = ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$GH = 1)

(Eq5)
where the summation generalizes to an integral for continuous covariates. In words, this is the
proportion of the population previously known to be HIV-positive plus the adjusted proportion of
the population newly known to be HIV-positive.
Taking the ratio of the numerator (Eq4) to the denominator (Eq5) yields a fully-adjusted
statistical parameter for population-level suppression under the above assumptions.
Estimation approaches

The unadjusted parameter (Eq1) can be estimated with the empirical proportion of the
population with measured viral suppression. The baseline-adjusted parameter (Eq2÷Eq3) can
also be estimated with empirical proportions. Specifically, we would generate covariate strataspecific estimates by taking empirical means, and then combine by standardizing across strata.

A similar approach was used in the PopART Universal-Test-and-Treat trial with stratification
factors including sex, age group and community.17,33,34 This approach corresponds to Gcomputation when fully-saturated regressions are used to estimate the conditional probability of
the outcome, given measurement and the adjustment set (i.e. the “outcome regression”).28,35,36 It
is further equivalent to inverse-weighting when fully-saturated regressions are used to estimate
the conditional probability of measurement, given the adjustment set (i.e. the “propensity
score”).37–39
When the adjustment set is higher dimensional, such as for our fully-adjusted parameter
(Eq4÷Eq5), alternative approaches are needed to smooth over values of the covariates with
weak support. We could, for example, use logistic regression with two-way interactions to
estimate the propensity scores for inverse-weighting. This approach was used in a sensitivity
analysis in the Ya Tsie Universal-Test-and-Treat trial.18,40
Another approach is targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), which offers
efficiency gains over inverse-weighting and allows for flexible adjustment for a large set of
covariates through machine learning.24,41 TMLE combines estimates of outcome regression with
an estimate of the propensity score. (We refer the reader to 42 and 43 for an introduction.) TMLE
is double robust - it is consistent if either the outcome regression is consistently estimated or the

propensity score is consistently estimated. TMLE is also a substitution estimator, potentially
improving robustness under strong confounding or rare outcomes.44–47
Implementation

In SEARCH, the primary approach used TMLE to estimate the fully-adjusted parameter
(Eq4÷Eq5). Within TMLE, Super Learner was implemented to estimate the outcome regressions
and propensity scores.48 Super Learner is an ensemble, machine learning method using crossvalidation to build the optimal combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms.
We implemented TMLE fully stratified on community, allowing the outcome regressions and
propensity scores to vary by community.
For comparison, we also present the use of empirical proportions to estimate the
unadjusted parameter (Eq1), and the baseline-adjusted parameters (Eq2÷Eq3) controlling for
sex, age group (15-19 years, 20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, and 60+
years), and community.
Statistical inference was obtained with influence curve standard errors, treating the
community as the unit of independence. Analyses were conducted in R_v.3.6.1 with the
ltmle_v1.1-0 and SuperLearner_v2.0-25 packages.49–51

The baseline characteristics of the study participants have been described
elsewhere.8,9,25 In brief, approximately one-third of the 79,818 residents enumerated in the
baseline census were from each study region, and nearly half of participants were aged 15-30
years; men comprised 45% (Supplementary Table 1). HIV status was determined on 89%
(71,402) of residents at baseline (Table 1). After baseline, knowledge of HIV serostatus
remained high with 77% of residents (69,175/90,047) seen at population-level testing at Year 1,
75% (71,577/95,599) at Year 2, and 81% (80,390/99,186) at Year 3. There were no obvious
demographic differences between the enumerated population and those with known HIV
serostatus (Supplementary Table 1).
Viral loads were measured for 76% of baseline HIV-positive residents (Table 1). Missing
viral loads were more common at baseline due to early assay failures.26 Despite ~95% coverage
of viral load measurement for the remaining years, baseline and time-varying characteristics
differed for HIV-positive persons with measured versus missed HIV RNA levels (Table 2). In
particular, HIV-positive women were more likely to have their viral load measured than HIVpositive men. After baseline, adolescents (15-24years) were more likely to be missed than older
adults (25+years). Viral load measurement also differed notably by the time-varying
characteristics; HIV-positive persons who were previously aware of their status, had evidence of

starting ART, or had a history of suppressing viral replication were more likely to have their viral
load measured than their counterparts.
Estimates of population-level suppression did vary meaningfully by identifiability
assumption (Figure 2). At baseline, the unadjusted approach suggested that half of all HIVpositive residents had suppressed viral replication (50%; 95%CI: 46-54%). Stratifying on age
group, sex, and community slightly reduced the estimate to 49% (95%CI: 45-54%), and the
most conservative estimate of 42% (95%CI: 38-46%) was obtained after adjusting for the full set
of baseline and time-varying characteristics.
Deviations between estimates of population-level suppression were pronounced in
subsequent years (Figure 2). The unadjusted approach suggested that 80% (95%CI: 78-82%)
of all HIV-positive residents were suppressed at Year 1, 85% (95%CI: 83-86%) at Year 2, and
85% (95%CI: 83-87%) at Year 3. Estimates adjusted for baseline covariate-strata were similar:
79% (95%CI: 77-81%) at Year 1, 84% (95%CI: 82-86%) at Year 2, and 84% (95%CI: 83-86%)
at Year 3. Fully adjusted estimates were the most conservative: 71% (95%CI: 69-73%) at Year
1, 76% (95%CI: 74-78%) at Year 2, and 79% (95%CI: 77-81%) at Year 3.

In an open cohort of nearly 100,000 residents in rural Kenya and Uganda, we compared
three approaches for estimating population-level HIV viral suppression: (i) an unadjusted
approach, the empirical proportion among those measured; (ii) stratification on age group, sex,
and community; and (iii) TMLE with Super Learner to adjust for the full set of baseline and timevarying covariates. Despite high coverage of out-of-facility testing, estimates diverged by
identifiability assumptions. The unadjusted approach consistently yielded the highest estimates;
the fully-adjusted approach consistently yielded the lowest estimates.
In the SEARCH study, HIV serostatus and HIV RNA viral levels were obtained through
multidisease testing at health fairs with follow-up for non-participants.25 Unlike clinic-based
ascertainment, this approach reaches HIV-positive persons who are in-care as well as newly
diagnosed and previously diagnosed but out-of-care.9,16–18 As a result, the MCAR assumption
may seem reasonable.1–4 However, deviations between the unadjusted estimates and adjusted
ones suggest there were meaningful differences in the population measured and population
missed with respect to, among other factors, prior diagnosis, ART use, and viral suppression.
Both adjusted approaches were built on the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption:
knowledge of HIV status and viral load measurement were only a function of observed
characteristics.1–4 When controlling for baseline covariates, we fully stratified on sex, age group,

and community; as a result, this was equivalent to a fully non-parametric approach for the
outcome regression in G-computation and to a fully non-parametric approach for the propensity
score in inverse-weighting. Beyond age, sex, and community, there were, however, additional
differences between those with measured versus missing viral loads, including differences in
post-baseline variables; specifically, persons without prior diagnosis, ART initiation, or viral
suppression were less likely to have their viral load measured.
Therefore, our primary approach in SEARCH was to weaken the identifiability
assumptions by adjusting for a larger set of baseline and time-updated covariates. TMLE with
Super Learner was used to flexibly estimate the conditional probability of HIV seropositivity,
conditional probability of suppression, and conditional probabilities of measurement.8,9,27
In this example, the identification choice has implications for policy-making and targeting
resources. Both the unadjusted and baseline-adjusted approaches suggested the UNAIDS 9090-90 target (73%-suppression) was surpassed within one year of the intervention and the
UNAIDS 95-95-95 target (86%-suppression) was nearly achieved by the trial’s close.5 In
contrast, the estimates controlling for time-updated covariates indicated the 90-90-90 target was
achieved after two years, but there still was a substantial gap to the 95-95-95 target.

In summary, estimates of population-level HIV viral suppression continue to be the
benchmark in assessing programmatic success in epidemic control. In four cross-sectional
analyses of 79,818-99,186 participants in the intervention arm of SEARCH, we demonstrated
the impact of assumptions on incomplete measurement that can occur even in “Big Data”
settings. We recommend adjustment for a large set of baseline and time-varying covariates that
potentially influence both measurement and underlying status; TMLE with Super Learner is one
approach to performing such adjustments.

Appendix: UNAIDS 90-90-90 target and population-level suppression

For the moment assume complete measurement, and let 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ be an indicator of HIVpositive serostatus at time t; 𝐷𝑥$ be an indicator of having an HIV diagnosis by time t; 𝐴𝑅𝑇$ be
an indicator of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use at time t, and 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ be an indicator of
suppressed viral replication at time t. The UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets are a series of proportions
or conditional probabilities:5
% of all HIV-positives who are diagnosed (first-90):

ℙ(𝐷𝑥$ = 1|𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1) =

ℙ(𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)
ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19012781; this version posted November 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

% of diagnosed who are on ART (second-90):

ℙ(𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1| 𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1) =

ℙ(𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)
ℙ( 𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)

% on ART who are currently suppressed (third-90):

ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1|𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1) =

ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1, 𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)
ℙ(𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)

Multiplying together the three “90s” yields the proportion of all HIV-positive persons who are
currently suppressed (i.e. population-level suppression):

ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1| 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1) =

ℙ(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝$ = 1, 𝐴𝑅𝑇$ = 1, 𝐷𝑥$ = 1, 𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)
ℙ(𝐻𝐼𝑉$ = 1)

Since each numerator and denominator is a population-level proportion, we can equivalently
express the targets as follows: first-90=(number previously diagnosed)/(number HIV-positive),
second-90=(number on ART)/(number previously diagnosed), third-90=(number virally
suppressed)/(number on ART), and population-level suppression=(number virally
suppressed)/(number HIV-positive).
Therefore, one could directly estimate population-level suppression, as we demonstrated
here, or instead estimate each 90-90-90 target and multiply. These two approaches should yield
identical results, as demonstrated in our previous work.8,9,27 However, deviations between the
direct estimate and the multiplied-one can occur when making the missing-completely-atrandom (MCAR) assumption.1–4 Specifically, under MCAR, the denominators of the third-90 and

almost always a subset of the population on ART and a subset of the population who is HIVpositive.
