Abstract
Leishmaniasis is a vector borne zoonosis which is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Among the three
most common forms of the disease, Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most threatening to human health,
causing 20,000 to 30,000 deaths worldwide each year. Areas where VL is mostly endemic have unprotected
dogs in community and houses. The presence of dogs usually increases VL risk for humans since dogs are
the principal reservoir host for the parasite of the disease. Based on this fact, most earlier studies consider
culling dogs as a control measure for the spread of VL. A more recent control measure has been the use of
deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars (DIDCs) to protect both humans and dogs by putting DIDCs on dogs
neck. The presence of dogs helps to grow the sandfly population faster by offering a more suitable blood-meal
source. On the other hand, the presence of DIDCs on dogs helps to reduce sandfly population by the lethality
of deltamethrin insecticide. This study brings an ecological perspective to this public health concern, aiming
to understand the impact of an additional host (here, protected dogs) on disease risk to a primary host (here,
humans). To answer this question, we compare two different settings: a community without dogs, and a
community with dogs protected with DIDC. Our analysis shows the presence of protected dogs can reduce
VL infection risk in humans. However, this disease risk reduction depends on dogs’ tolerance for sandfly bites.

Introduction

The Leishmaniases are a group of diseases caused by the protozoa parasite Leishmania [1, 3], which is transmitted by the bites of female sandflies [3, 4]. Over 20 Leishmania species known to be infective to humans are
transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. Leishmaniasis is classified as a neglected
tropical disease (NTD). It is found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe [3]. However,
the disease mainly affects poor people in Africa, Asia and Latin America [1]. There are three main types of
leishmaniasis among which visceral, often known as Kala-azar, is the most serious form of the disease [1]. Regarding visceral leishmaniasis, more than 90% of all cases occur in just the six countries of India, Bangladesh,
Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil, and Ethiopia [13].
Out of 200 countries and territories reporting to the World Health Organization (WHO), 77 countries
are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in 2017. In 2016, over 90% of global VL cases were reported from
seven countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. As of October 2018, 50
VL-endemic countries have reported 2017 data to the WHO Global Leishmaniasis programme [1]. Annually,
700,000 to 1 million new cases and 20,000 to 30,000 deaths occur [2]. Currently, this is one of the major public
health concerns. Even though human VL is spread by female sandflies, dogs are the main reservoir of the VL
parasite. Thus, dogs presence in a community normally increases human VL incidence. In the last couple of
decades, many clinical and mathematical studies have been conducted aiming to understand the dynamics of
Zoonotic VL (ZVL). In these studies, researchers tried to find ways of controlling VL prevalence. Different
strategies for controlling the incidence of VL have been considered, most notably culling dogs and putting
insecticide-impregnated dog collars on dogs.
In 2002, Gavgani et al. clinically studied two possible strategies– early diagnosis and treatment, and use of
deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars (DIDC). The presence of deltamethrin insecticide on dog collars helps

to kill a portion of sandlies, and eventually reduces the disease transmission. Outcomes of the study showed
that use of DIDC is helpful in reducing human infection, and this strategy can replace the controversial dog
culling program [8]. In addition to clinical studies, several mathematical models have also been used to study
transmission and control strategies for ZVL. In 2013, Ribas et al. proposed and analyzed a deterministic
mathematical model in order to compare different control strategies. They showed that using DIDC is better
at reducing human infections[5].
In 2016, Zhao et al. studied ZVL transmission using an SEIR deterministic model [9]. In their model they
incorporated hospitalization of infected humans, migration for the sandfly population, and infection-related
death for sandflies. Also, they assumed that the contact rates between sandflies and hosts (dogs and humans)
are independent of vector population, biting exposed dogs cannot infect sandflies, and immunity for both of
the hosts, humans and dogs, is permanent. Later, they compared three different control strategies−vaccination
of dogs, use of insecticide at vector breeding sites, and personal protection. Their analysis found controlling
the sandfly population to be the most effective control measure.
The next year, in 2017, Shimozako et al. used the SEIR deterministic model also to study ZVL disease
dynamics. They included a delay term instead of using latent compartment for the sandfly population [6].
In this study, they estimated the basic reproduction number R0 and analyzed the stability and sensitivity of
the system, and finally made some recommendation regarding control strategies. Unlike Zhao’s work, they
assumed that sandflies can be infected from biting exposed dogs, and immunity gained by both of the host
populations is temporary. Interestingly, they assumed that exposed dogs and humans become susceptible to
VL when recovery precedes the appearance of symptoms. Their work also assumed that the rate at which
vectors bite hosts is independent of host density. Outcomes of their study showed that control strategy for
ZVL should be focused on sandflies and infected dogs. However, considering the ethical concerns regarding
culling dogs they recommend to prioritize the control of sandfly population.
All the research related to ZVL has mainly addressed public health concerns where researchers study
different control strategies. In these studies, we always find the presence of human and dog populations as
hosts for sandflies, the vector of the disease. This host richness (host diversity) leads us to think about
the dilution effect (reduction in disease risk resulting from species diversity). The effect of the presence of
an additional host is not straightforward. It can increase, or decrease disease risk depending on varieties
of factors. In 2010, Johnson and Thieltges showed that host diversity helps in reducing human infections
depending on the relative abundance of additional host(s) relative to the focal host [10]. In 2014, Miller and
Huppert (2014) proved that species diversity in host population can amplify or can dilute disease prevalence
depending on vectors’ preference of host [11]. Recently in 2019, Zahid and Kribs established that the presence
of an additional host in domestic settings can help to reduce disease prevalence in humans if the distance
between two host populations remains within a certain range [12]. These works challenge the established idea
that biodiversity always helps to reduce disease risk. It is always interesting to observe how the presence of
other hosts, in addition to humans, influences the dynamics of vector-borne diseases, impacts disease risk and
human health.
This study shifts the research question from a public health viewpoint to an ecological one. As dogs are
the main reservoir for the parasite, the usual presence of dogs in a domestic, or in a community setting makes
VL transmission faster ensuring more suitable blood-meal source for its vector sandflies. Hence, this paper
aims to identify the impact of the presence of protected dogs (protected by putting deltamethrin-impregnated
dog collars) as an additional host on the prevalence of VL in humans.
The presence of protected dogs in a community has two contradictory effects. It ensures a better bloodmeal source for vector population since biting a dog is much easier for sandflies than biting a human. Thus,
dog presence in a community helps sandfly population to grow faster. Moreover, dog presence increases the
proportion of infected sandflies (since dogs are the main reservoir of the parasite) which eventually increases
human infection risk. On the contrary, use of DIDCs on dogs as topical insecticide reduces the sandfly
population by the lethality effect, which can result in fewer cases of VL. The net result of these two contrary
effects may reduce or enhance the risk of human prevalence. The goal of this study is to understand and
examine this net effect, and eventually to understand if the presence of protected dogs has any dilution effect
on human risk of VL infections. To answer this question, here we consider two different settings: a setting
with protected dogs, and a setting with no dogs. To analyze and understand these two different settings, in
this study we use an SEIRS deterministic model.

Model development

The SEIRS model we use here to understand the dynamics of VL incorporates three different populations: two
hosts−dogs and humans, and the vector− sandflies. We neither consider hospitalization of sick humans, nor
any migration for the vectors. Based on results of an early clinical study [14], we include disease transmission
from symptomatic infected humans to vectors. This inclusion makes this model different from the models
formulated by Zhao et al. [9], and by Shimozako et al. [6].
Like the models proposed by [5, 6], we also assume hosts’ immunity temporary. Similar to their model,
we assume both of the hosts may acquire natural immunity directly from the exposed state. In contrast to
[5, 6], however, we assume that exposed hosts cannot become susceptible without having any immunity. In
our model, we have µ0D = µD + αD and µ0H = µH + αH where αD and αH represent VL-induced death rates
for dogs and humans respectively. The presence of deltamethrin on the collars causes additional deaths at the
rate αS (migration of sandflies due to presence of DIDCs, if any, can be included in αS ) for vectors. So, the
vectors are leaving at a rate µ0S where µ0S = µS + αS .
The most important factor which makes our model distinct from others’ models is the encounter (biting)
rate between hosts and vectors, which incorporates the notion of host irritability. The maximum number
of bites per unit time a dog can tolerate is not the same as the maximum number of bites per unit time a
human can tolerate. This issue of host-density dependent encounter rate is addressed by Blayneh et al. in
2010 [16] while modeling dynamics of West Nile Virus. However, the contact rate they used is independent
of host population size. But, the sandfly biting rate is limited both by the sandfly’s preferred feeding rate
and by host irritability (unlike mosquitos, which are limited primarily by availability of breeding sites). So,
ND
min(cS NS , cD ND + cH NH ), and
we consider the encounter rate between sandflies and dogs λD = cD NcDD+c
H NH
cH NH
the encounter rate between sandflies and humans λH = cD ND +cH NH min(cS NS , cD ND + cH NH ) where cD and
cH represent the number of bites a dog, and a human can tolerate per unit time, cS represents the number of
bites a single sandfly desires to make per unit time, and N ’s represent population sizes. This inclusion of the
host population dependent biting rate makes our model distinct from other earlier proposed models. However,
not all the bites (encounters) can transmit the disease and so we multiply the total number of encounters by
bD (or bH or bSH or bSD ) (Table 2) which represents the proportion of bites (between 0 to 1) that result new
infections to dogs (or to humans or to sandflies). Finally, we have our model which is shown in Figure 1 and
described by system (1). All the model variables are summarized in Table 1.

Parameter Estimation

In 2017 the World Bank listed 207,833,831 as total population and 13.918/year as the birth rate (crude)
per 1000 people for Brazil [19]. We use the total number of municipalities in Brazil, 5570 [20], to estimate
the average population (37,313) in a single municipality of Brazil. Then using this average population and
the birth rate we estimate the recruitment rate for humans to get ΛH =1.42 humans/day. To estimate the
recruitment rate in the dog population, we use the results of a study performed in 2005-2008 in Vargem Grande,
a neighborhood of the municipality of São Paulo, Brazil, with a population of 16,946 [21]. The study estimated
1337 and 1445 new dogs in 2006 and 2008 respectively, which gives a mean increase of 1391 dogs/year. Then

we apply the ratio 2.20, of the population per municipality (estimated above) to the population of the study
area of [21], which estimates an increment of 3060 dogs/year in a municipality of average population. And,
we get ΛD = 3060
365 dogs/day=8.39 dogs/day.
Female sandflies take 3 to 5 days after their emergence to take a blood-meal, and it takes 7.67 days (mean
of 6 days, 8 days, and 9 days) from blood-meal to oviposition (laying of eggs) [15]. They usually take only
one blood-meal until they lay eggs, and begin feeding again after oviposition [34]. Therefore, each vector has
1
a single bite in every 7.67 days, and thus we have cS = 7.67
bite/vector-day=0.13 bite/vector-day. Also, we
have 10 (mean of 13, 8 and, 9) new female sandflies per egg batch [15] which gives us aS =10 sandflies/bite.
A study in 2010 found 12 sandflies infected when 81 sandflies were fed on people with active VL infection
12
[14], and this gives us bSH = 81
= 0.148 infected sandfly/bite. Another study in 2013 showed that 35.8% of
sandflies that fed on asymptomatic dogs, and 24.7% of sandflies that fed on symptomatic dogs got the infection
[18]. We take the mean (30.25%) of these two estimations to get bSD =0.3025 sandfly/bite. However, for bH ,
bD we take the estimations from [17] as 0.5 infected human/bite, and 0.01 infected dog/bite respectively.
In 2017, life expectancy at birth in Brazil was 76 years [19], so we take its reciprocal to estimate the natural
death rate for people in Brazil which gives µH = 3.6 × 10−5 /day. In Brazil, there are four common dog breeds,
and their mean lifespan is 11.875 years [22]. We take the reciprocal of the life span as death rate, and we get
µD = 2.30 × 10−4 /day. To estimate the natural death rate of sandflies we take the reciprocal of their mean
lifespan which is 2 weeks [23], and get µS =0.0174/day.
A study of ZVL cases in Bihar, India, in 2013 showed that 154 patients died among a total of 3,641 patients
[24], and their average life span was 66.73 years. However, the life expectancy at birth in Bihar at that time
period was 68.1 years [25]. Therefore, we take the

20 hours duration from their exposure, and pooled data from all trials to get 5,766 and 1245 as the totals of
exposed sandflies, and dead sandflies respectively. However, our estimation of sandflies’ natural death rate

Analysis

We begin with the general model where we incorporate three different populations – sandflies (the vector), and
two host populations– dogs (protected with DIDC) and humans. Later, we consider a special case without
dogs in the setting. Finally, we compare these two cases to understand the impact of the presence of protected
dogs on the prevalence of VL infections in humans. The study actually aims to understand the effects of host
diversity on disease transmission, and eventually on human health.
In the general model, the total number of desired bites for sandflies and the total number of bites that hosts
can tolerate together may not be equal. Thus, in our analysis we consider two cases in terms of total number of
possible encounters. In the first case, we assume the maximum total number of possible vector bites is less than
the total possible number of bites that both hosts (humans and protected dogs) can tolerate together, that is
when cS NS < cD ND +cH NH . The other scenario takes place when cS NS > cD ND +cH NH . For the initial case
0
our calculation estimates the total vector population as NS (t) = NS (0)e(aS cS −µS )t (recall µ0S = µS +αS ) which
shows that the vector population decreases with time and eventually dies out, if aS cS < µ0S . However, NS
increases with time under the condition aS cS > µ0S . If the vector population continues to grow then the base
condition of the first case, that is cS NS < cD ND + cH NH , cannot be true after a certain time. Eventually, the
relation between the maximum possible number of vector bites and the maximum host bite tolerance (inverse
of hosts’ irritability) turns into cS NS > cD ND + cH NH , which is the second case. These analyses give us two
scenarios: either the vector population dies out, or the only possible case is cS NS > cD ND + cH NH (second
case). Since we are interested to understand the disease dynamics, from here our study will consider only the
case of cS NS > cD ND + cH NH .
To find equilibrium points for our model we set all the equations of our system equal to zero and solve

To understand the behavior of disease dynamics, the threshold value BRN (R0 ) and endemic equilibrium
(EE) need to be understood, and interpreted properly. Our analysis shows R0 > 1 if and only if C > 0.
For endemic equilibrium, we cannot establish any specific condition to ensure the positivity of EE since its
analytic expression, obtained from equation (3), is very complex (recall expressions of coeffficients A, B and
C). Consequently, we perform numerical explorations to understand the behavior of our dynamical system,
and finally conclude that the model has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever R0 > 1. It does not appear
possible for A, B, C all to be positive together. To check the stability of our EE, we evaluate the Jacobian
matrix of our dynamical system, and perform numerical explorations. Our simulations show that the endemic
equilibrium is unconditionally stable.
Now, we consider the case of having no dogs in the scene, a special case (setting all variables and parameters

related to dogs to zero) of our original model. Our analysis for this special case finds the DF E as SH = Λ

=3023, 3329, and 4677 out of 39,445, respectively, for these three cases. These
estimates indicate that the presence of DIDC-protected dogs is better than having no dogs, which in turn is
better than having unprotected dogs (in terms of human infections of leishmaniasis). The R0 values for these
same cases are 1.47, 3.51, and 2.05 respectively. These results provide fewer human infections with a higher
R0 value for the no dog case compared to the case of unprotected dogs. Humans are spreading infections
faster in the case of no dog; however, the contribution of the dog population to new infections is missing in
this case. Thus, the case of no dog in the community produces fewer infections even though the R0 value is
higher compared to the case of unprotected dogs. The expression for R0 in (2) helps us to understand this
apparently unusual result better. One of Q12 ’s two terms, and all of Q3 , have to do with dogs. Removing
them will reduce R0 , especially since sandfly biting rate is asymptotically host-dependent. Figure 2 shows how

sensitivity indices greater than 14 , the two most of interest to this study are cD and αS .
Now we vary the values of cD and αS together to observe the contribution of dogs’ irritability and the
efficacy of DIDC simultaneously in reducing human infections. Our analysis shows that the number of human
infections increases with dogs’ tolerance for bites (cD ), because this allows vectors’ easy access to bite dogs
which helps the sandfly population to grow. It also increases the proportion of infected sandflies, because the
probability of infection to sandflies from biting dogs is higher than the probability of new infection from biting
humans. The number of human infections increases also for extremely low dog tolerance, because it reduces the
lethality of protected collars by reducing the number of interactions between sandflies and dogs significantly.
Also, humans get almost all the bites here which eventually increases human infection risk. Hence, the number
of human cases of VL infections is not always proportional to dogs’ tolerance to sandfly bites. Figure 4 clearly
explains the above discussion regarding the effect of dogs’ tolerance for sandfly bites. Our analysis also shows
that human infections decrease with the population size of protected dogs. However, based on our parameter
estimation, we find 58% of the dog population needs to be protected with DIDC to ensure the effectiveness
of the presence of protected dogs in reducing human risk of VL infections.

Discussion

The model used in this study gives a new insight to the study of visceral leishmaniasis transmission among
human, dog, and sandfly populations. This happens as this study considers humans as a competent host
(based on earlier research [14]), in contrast to other studies’ assumption of treating humans as a dead-end
host (assuming dogs as the only source of vector infections). The host-population-dependent biting rate
for sandflies highlights the impact of host biodiversity more than other models used in the earlier studies
of leishmanisis. Our results show the presence of dogs with DIDC (as topical insecticide) in a community
produces fewer human infections compared to infections in the same community without dogs. It is also
confirmed that a community without dogs is better in terms of VL infections in humans than a community
containing unprotected dogs.
Zhao et al. (2016) [9] develop and analyze an SEIR model assuming hosts’ recovery from infections
permanent. In our model, we consider recovery for hosts as temporary which leads us to use an SEIRS
model. They incorporate sandfly migration in the model which we do not. Their analysis finds the condition
R0 < 1 insufficient for complete control of the disease since they observe the existence of backward bifurcation
under the condition Rc < R0 < 1. In our study, we find only one endemic equilibrium which precludes any
possibility of the existence of backward bifurcation. Identifying which feature of their model is responsible
for the backward bifurcation is prevented by the fact that their study did not provide the definition of k3
which is present in the definition of Rc . Even though our study does not focus on optimal control policy like
Zhao et al., we study the impact of presence of protected (with DIDC) dogs, and find this presence helpful
in producing fewer human infections.
Shimozako et al. (2017) [6] assumed recovery for both hosts from VL infections is temporary, so they used
an SEIRS model in studying ZVL transmission. We also use a modified SEIRS model even though we exclude
their assumption that exposed hosts (dogs and humans both) can become susceptible without developing any
immunity. We also do not adopt their assumption that latent, and clinically ill dogs have different probabilities
of infecting sandflies. They find VL transmission completely dependent on the dog and sandfly populations.
However, our study shows each of the three populations has contributions in the dynamics of VL transmission.
Shimozako et al. (2017) suggests that control of VL transmission should be based on the sandfly population.
Our analysis agrees with this suggestion, showing that presence of dogs with DIDC protection (which reduces
sandfly population) reduces human cases of visceral leishmanisis.
Our study also draws on an ecological perspective to inform public health policy. In the literature review,
we mentioned ecological studies [10, 11, 12] in which the presence of additional hosts (known as host richness)
may help in reducing the human infection risk depending on some factors, such as the abundance of additional
host(s) relative to the focal host, vectors’ preference of host for feeding, and distance between the primary host
and additional host. This study also found the presence of an additional host (dogs protected with DIDC)
helpful in reducing human risk of VL infections. However, this reduction is independent of all three of the
factors which are identified in [10, 11, 12]. We find that dogs’ presence in a community does not produce
fewer human infections if dogs’ irritability is very high, or extremely low even after DIDCs are ensured on

them. This ecological change helps to protect human health only if dogs’ irritability ranges somewhere in the
intermediate level.
Our proposed model has a few limitations in its development. In our study, we assume all dogs in a
community are protected by deltamethrin-impregnated collars which may not be possible in reality. Also,
we do not incorporate sandfly migration in our model. However, this migration rate can be included in our
DIDC-induced sandfly death rate (αS ). Inclusion of this migration may have some impact on our numerical
results, and also on the range of dog irritability values which are helpful. However, our qualitative results
will remain the same. Addressing this limitations could produce better insights into visceral leishmaniasis
dynamics. Our proposed model offers a better base than other models for studying control strategies for ZVL,
and VL transmission since we incorporate some real, and very important issues, like human infectivity and
the role of host irritability.
