A recent perspective published in The Lancet emphasizes the historical and modern
occupational strains of medical professionals1. As concern for the well-being of medical
professionals has increased, the high rates of depression and suicidal ideation observed
among medical students2 and residents3 have garnered increasing attention. However,
the causes of such psychological distress among health professionals are still unknown.
One possibility is that such negative outcomes arise from individual differences in how
clinicians respond to the emotional states of their patients. Prior work has shown that
people differ in how they respond to those who are in distress: while some tend respond
with empathy (feeling what others feel), others tend respond with compassion (caring
about what others feel)4. Here we investigate the hypothesis that empathy is related to
higher levels of burnout and affective symptoms, while compassion is related to lower
levels of these outcomes.
We surveyed 464 undergraduate students and professionals in medicine (34·3%),
psychology (47%) and nursing (18·8%), 79.7% female, with a median age of 23·3. To
assess compassion, we used the concern and perspective taking subscales from the
Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). To assess empathy, we used the empathy and
behavioral contagion from the Empathy Index (EI)4. Symptoms of negative affect were
assessed using the depression, anxiety, and anger subscales from PROMIS5, and
burnout was assessed using the Medical Student Well-Being Index (MSWBI). This
study was approved by the Ethics Committee from UFRGS.
Empathy was associated with higher symptoms of burnout (=·691, p<·001),
depression (=·456, p<·001), anxiety (=·669, p<·001) and anger (=·59, p<·001);
higher levels of compassion were associated with lower burnout (=-·457, p=·002),
depression (=-·47, p<·001), anxiety (=-·487, p=·002) and anger (=-·642, p<·001).

Post-hoc analysis revealed that results were driven by the Perspective Taking subscale
of the IRI and Empathy subscale of the EI (Figure 1).
Our findings provide new evidence that the well-being of medical professionals might
be affected differently depending on socio-emotional traits relevant to emotional
connection. These results raise two important issues. First, the medical literature omits
the conceptual and psychological distinction between empathy and compassion as two
different traits with different socio-emotional effects. Second, to the extent that medical
professionals are trained to feel more empathy, such training might have unwanted
consequences on their mental health. In contrast, a focus on increasing compassion
among medical professionals might have desirable consequences on their well-being.

Figure 1. Associations between Perspective Taking and Empathy with burnout

Post-hoc analysis showed association of Perspective Taking with lower depression (= ·298, p<·001), anxiety (= -·313, p<·001), anger (= -·415, p<·001) and burnout (= ·267, p=·005). Empathy was associated with higher levels of depression (= ·33,
p=·016), anxiety (= ·514, p=·001), anger (= ·373, p=.008) and burnout (= ·578,
p=·006).
