Health Inequality in Gambling - 2
ABSTRACT
Objective: Here we present a systematic review of the existing research into gambling harms,
in order to determine whether there are differences in the presentation of these across
demographic groups such as age, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status, or gambling
behaviour categories such as risk severity and play frequency.
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Inclusion criteria were: 1) focus on gambling
harms; 2) focus on harms to the gambler rather than affected others; 3) discussion of specific
listed harms and not just harms in general terms. Exclusion criteria were: 1) not written in
English; 2) not an empirical study (i.e. an editorial piece or letter); 3) not available as a full
article.
Search: A systematic search was conducted using the Web of Science database in August
2019. Selected studies were assessed for quality using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria.
Results: Forty-Seven studies published between 2006 and 2019 met the inclusion criteria.
These were categorised into thematic groups for comparison and discussion. There were
replicated differences found in groups defined by age, risk severity and gambling behaviours.
However, the majority of research regarding gender concluded that harm profiles were
similar, or differences could be explained by confounding variables.
Conclusion: Harms appear to be dependent on specific social, demographic and
environmental conditions that suggests there is a health inequality in gambling related harms.
Further investigation is required to develop standardised measurement tools and to
understand confounding variables and co-morbidities. With a robust understanding of harms
distribution in the population, Primary Care Workers will be better equipped to identify those
who are at risk, or who are showing signs of Gambling Disorder, and to target prevention and
intervention programmes appropriately.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years there has been an increase in gambling participation [1] and we predict
that the harms resulting from gambling behaviour are not distributed evenly amongst the
population. This would suggest that there is a health inequality that needs to be addressed,
and therefore in conducting this review we aim to identify which individuals are most at risk,
and how harms are likely to present in the general population before the point of clinical
diagnosis.
The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMV)[2] introduced Gambling Disorder as a behavioural addiction. This is the first behavioural
addiction to be included in the DSM and the condition is an increasing public health concern
[3]

, as new accessible methods of play such as online and mobile gambling have led to an

increase in gambling behaviour. For diagnosis using the DSM-V an individual must
experience harmful consequences from their behaviour, so understanding the potential harms
resulting from gambling is more important than ever.
There have been a number of recent Systematic Reviews completed in the field of
gambling, investigating a range of ideas such as the relationship between crime and gambling
disorders [4, 5], quality of life measurement tools [6], comorbidity with other conditions [7],
impulsivity in gambling [8, 9], or potential interventions and harm minimisation tools [10, 11, 12,
13]

. Despite this body of research, and many individual studies investigating specific gambling

harms, a systematic review of how harms are distributed across society hasn’t yet been done.
Although many studies have investigated how harms can be minimised [14, 15, 16], a complete
understanding of the disease and its impact on society is dependent on understanding how
harms are distributed across the population. If our intuitions are correct then this poses a
health inequality that needs to be addressed.
Harms related to gambling behaviour have been found to affect all types of individual,
including low and moderate risk, or sub-clinical, gamblers [17, 18, 19]. The National Strategy to
Reduce Gambling Harm [20] states “An effective prevention plan must seek to identify the
right mix of interventions to be applied at both the population and individual level,” and so a
thorough understanding of how an individual experiences harm would be beneficial in
understanding gambling as a whole and developing effective interventions. It has been
suggested that in order to develop effective tools for minimising harm agencies need to
consider aggregate harm to individuals, rather than the estimated prevalence of problem
gamblers [21]. Current estimates suggest that there are 2 million adults experiencing some
level of harm from gambling [1] and a thorough understanding of how harms are presented
within these individuals, and within at-risk groups, may help in identifying those at risk and
targeting interventions where they are most needed.

Objective
To present a systematic review of the existing research into gambling harms, to
determine whether there are differences in the presentation of these across demographic
groups such as age, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status, or gambling behaviour
categories such as risk severity and play frequency.

Search Strategy
Studies that have explored specific harms and the prevalence of these within a
population were identified using a search of records held by Web of Science[22]. The database
was searched on 19th August 2019 using the following criteria; (TI= ((gambl* OR problem*
gambl*) AND (harm* OR negative impact* OR adverse impact* OR detrimental impact* OR
negative ?ffect OR adverse ?ffect OR detrimental ?ffect OR consequences)). This yielded
180 results. Initially the search was conducted within the abstracts of studies, however this
yielded 2,283 results and the first two pages of these were not relevant to the review, so a
second search was restricted to titles only. Search terms were selected using
‘thesaurus.com’[23] and the Oxford English Dictionary Online[24] to identify synonyms and the
final criteria was developed through a trial and error process, using each synonym and a
combination of Boolean terms until the most successful criteria were identified, in terms of
number of studies returned, and relevance of studies returned.

Inclusion Criteria
Studies were included that discussed harms from gambling, discussed harms to the
gambler, and discussed or listed a minimum of two identified harms rather than discussing
harm minimisation or harms in general terms. For the purpose of this review a clinical
diagnosis of Gambling Disorder, or an increased risk of diagnosis as shown by the Problem
Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) or South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), was considered a
gambling harm.

The 180 results were screened to identify duplicates, and results that were not empirical
reports, or were short articles. Letters or editorial pieces were excluded along with any results
not available in English. Studies that did not discuss specific harms, did not discuss
gambling, only investigated harms to others rather than the gambler, or were not available as
a full article were also excluded. This left a total of 47 studies of which 17 were qualitative,
28 were quantitative, and 2 were mixed methods.

Quality Evaluation
Studies were assessed for quality (Figure 1) using the Standard Quality Assessment
Criteria [25]. This measures the quality of both quantitative and qualitative research using a
series of standardised questions on the key requirements for quality research. Studies which
followed a mixed methods approach were evaluated in terms of the most prominent research
style. Studies were coded in Excel using the guidelines set out by Kmet, Lee and Cook and
coloured using a traffic light system for reviewing.

Data Analysis Plan
Study design, participant number, diagnostic measures, harms measures, groups
analysed and funding source were extracted from the studies (Figure 2). The results which
described harm distribution were then included and categories were identified for analysis.
Studies were divided into these categories for comparison, with several studies providing
results for multiple groups, and the results were summarised in brief.
For the purpose of extracting relevant comparable data harms were defined using
Langham et al’s[26] 73-Item checklist (Figure 3), which identifies 8 domains of harm (Table
1). Delfabbro and King[27] argue that certain items attributed as harms are incorrectly

labelled, for example they suggest that chasing losses, gambling to obtain more excitement,
or betting above affordable means, are behaviours which lead to harm and not the harms
themselves. Schellinck et al[28] also argue that borrowing money is not a harm, but is in fact a
predictor for the harms, debt and relationship conflict. For the purpose of this study however,
the full proposed taxonomy of harms was analysed.
The risk categories of gambling described by the PGSI and SOGS were also included
as a gambling-related harm since the higher scores on these measures may predict risk of
clinical diagnosis.

RESULTS
Search and Selection Results
The database search returned 180 papers for review and 4 of these were excluded as
duplicates. Analysis of titles and abstracts led to a further 7 exclusions for not discussing
gambling, and 25 exclusions for not discussing harms. The remaining 144 studies were
reviewed in full, resulting in 30 studies being excluded for not being empirical reports, or
because they were short articles, letters or editorial pieces. Studies discussing only harms to
others resulted in 4 exclusions, 7 studies were unobtainable, and 11 studies were not available
in English. During the full-text review studies previously thought to discuss harms were
removed for briefly mentioning harm and not discussing specifics, this led to 45 more
exclusions leaving 47 studies remaining for analysis.

Risk Severity
Twelve studies include data on risk severity, which is the measure of behaviour that
puts someone at risk of developing a problem with gambling or developing Gambling
Disorder. Rintoul, Deblaquiere and Thomas[30] found that venues looked for signs of problem
gambling behaviour such as ‘shouting at the machine or other people in the venue’, appearing
depressed, being withdrawn or emotional, excessive sweating, extended play and continuing

to gamble with the winnings. In 34 hours they observed these signs in all venues and
concluded that risk factors for the behaviour included multiple machine use at one time and
withdrawing money several times at the venue.
In academic research the risk of developing Gambling Disorder is most frequently
measured using the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), a component of the Canadian
Problem Gambling Index [31], which categorises an individual as low risk or non-problem (0
score), moderate risk (1-2 score), high risk (3-7 score), or a problem gambler (8+ score).
Shannon, Anijoul and Blaszcynski[32] found that the PGSI reliably correlated with 48
indicators of harm. These harm indicators were compiled using data from a scoping literature
review, clinical case notes in a treatment setting, and a cohort of seven specialist clinicians.
Many of the studies looking into risk severity are focused on gathering evidence of the
Prevention Paradox. This describes a situation where the majority of cases of a disease come
from a population at low or moderate risk of that disease. In the case of gambling this means
the majority of harms are found within the low to moderate risk gamblers, and the minority is
found within high risk or problem gamblers.
In one study the prevalence of harm across non-problem (PGSI), or non-pathological
(SOGS), gamblers was twice that of problem gamblers in their participant sample [21].
Browne and Rockloff[18] found that only 10% of financial harms across the study population
were in the problem gambling or pathological gambling groups, and that more than 50% of
cases where someone sold their belongings to fund their gambling were in recreational or low
risk gamblers. In contrast to this they found that more than 50% of social deviance harms are
found within problem gamblers, and the remaining categories of harm were evenly
distributed across the severity groups.
Evidence of the prevention paradox was found by several other studies [19, 33, 34], though
it was also found that the highest severity harms were generally only found in the problem

gambling groups, as defined by the PGSI. Skaal et al[35] found psychological distress was
only associated with problem gambling and Lloyd et al[36] found that self-harm thoughts were
associated with problem gambling. Rawat et al[19] found that problem gamblers show similar
disability weights to those of Bipolar Disorder or alcohol dependence, whereas the low risk
group show disability weights equal to moderate anxiety. Disability weights are a healthrelated measure of quality of life using a ratio scale between 0 and 1, representing ideal
health and death. These estimates further suggest that although the majority of harms may be
found in the lower risk groups, the more severe harms are only prevalent within problem
gambling groups.
Li et al[37] found that selling personal items, absence from work or study, reduced
performance, poor sleep and extreme distress had the highest correlation with PGSI
categories. They also found that reduced spending on essential expenses, absence from work
or study, feelings of worthlessness, increased relationship conflict, and feeling like an outcast
were the most effective discriminators between the low and high-risk groups.
Shannon, Anijoul and Blaszcynski[32] found that across both a clinical and non-clinical
sample the lowest reported harms were substance use, suicide, bankruptcy, and education
problems. They found that the distribution of averaged harm scores was consistent across
both samples, excluding reduced savings and decreased happiness, suggesting that
psychological and financial harms are the most significant. The most common gambling
harms found represented negative impacts on general quality of life and psychological wellbeing, however the mean level of harm for the 15 most common indicators in the community
sample was less than one empirically defined unit.
Despite these results there has been some criticism of the PGSI as a measure of
gambling behaviour. The Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation[38] categorises the
PGSI groups as non-problem gambling, low risk, moderate risk and problem gambling,

which is distinctly different to the categories used in these studies. Delfabbro and King[39]
argued that harms cannot be confidently attributed to gambling in the low risk group, as some
studies consider individuals who score a 0 on the PGSI as low risk, rather than no risk. They
also argue that harms are not appropriately scaled, citing that “suicide is not equal to shame,”
and that when controlling for severity low risk categories show very few harms. However,
they did find that in financial harm categories the items they considered as more severe, such
as selling belongings, were present in the low risk groups. This may be due to the less
affluent socioeconomic status of the low risk category, and that it is hard to confidently
attribute these financial harms to gambling.

Age
Eighteen studies include data on age, and several of these found that being younger was
associated with a higher risk of experiencing gambling harms [40, 41, 42, 43, 33, 44]. In particular
one study found that younger age groups (16-34) were at risk of dependence and social harms
[45]

, however some studies found younger gamblers were less at risk of financial harms [46, 47],

despite one suggesting that they spent more [48]. Ferrara, Franceschini and Corsello[43] found
that as well as higher rates of what they label “problematic gambling”, younger age groups
showed a higher comorbidity with other addictions. However, Larsen, Curtis and
Bjerregaard[49] found that alcohol use increased with age in lifetime problem gamblers, as
defined by the DSM-IV criteria for ‘pathological gambling’, in opposition to the trend seen in
a general population.
Two studies found that age had no impact on harm profiles [21, 34], and Lloyd et al[36]
found no association between age and gambling-induced thoughts of self-harm. Pitt et al[46]
found that children aged 8-16 showed little or no current harms as they were gambling at

home with their families, spending small amounts of pocket money, or betting with activities
such as push-ups against family members.
Despite the apparent absence of harms in the youngest age groups children developed
false beliefs around gambling, such as that skill can be used to win, or that it is necessary for
everyone to try gambling at least once. Children were also found to understand how gambling
could gain them money. In Breen[50] it was found that youth who were exposed to gambling
at a young age were more likely to gamble later in life to increase their income, and that
youth who missed school had reduced lifelong aspirations and reduced opportunities.
Further research is needed to understand the distribution of harms across age groups as
it was found by Estevez et al[51] that sensation seeking and impulsivity were high in young
gamblers. Anxiety, depression and psychoticism were partially mediated by impulsivity, and
somatisation, obsessive-compulsive behaviour, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoid ideation
and hostility were perfectly mediated. Hubert and Griffiths[52] found that online gamblers are
more likely to be younger, and Bergh and Kuhlhorn[53] found that individuals aged 20-34
gambled for almost twice as long per session compared to participants over 35. Breen, Hing
and Gordon[48] discovered that younger gamblers preferred to play poker or other card games,
while Ferrara, Franceschini and Corsello[43] found that younger gamblers were more likely to
be sports bettors. These additional variables could explain some of the variance in harm
presentation and help to target appropriate interventions, as Ferrara, Franceschini and
Corsello[43] found that 0.2-12.3% of adolescents in their study met the criteria for a diagnosis
of Gambling Disorder depending upon country of residence.

Gender
Fifteen studies examined gender, and few of these found any evidence that harms
affected men and women differently [53, 21, 40, 41]. Where differences were found these could be

explained by other factors, such as studies that show men have a higher prevalence of harms
than women [42, 43, 54], being explained by men gambling more frequently than women and
spending more money when gambling [45, 47, 55]. Raisamo et al[33] in particular found that
although the prevalence of harms was higher in males, when controlling for frequency of play
and amount spent gender was no longer a significant factor. Moreover, Splevins et al[56]
found that men started gambling earlier than women and found it more exciting. This led to
increased spending and therefore an increased risk of harms such as substance use and
interpersonal conflicts.
Despite this some studies have suggested key differences in how gambling harms
present between genders. In Singapore, Goh, Ng and Yeoh[57] reported that “tentative
evidence… points to the risk of child neglect when the problem gambler is the mother.” They
also found that verbal abuse was most commonly displayed by males towards their mothers,
but no difference was found in cases of physical abuse between genders. McCarthy et al[58]
found that women were more likely to report mental health comorbidity than males, however
causality is not discussed.
One key study which found an opposing result was Salonen, Alho and Castren[59] who
found that while gambling was more common in young males, women displayed an increase
in specific harms between 2011 and 2015 where men did not. This particular study also
looked at attitudes towards gambling and found that while female attitudes were generally
negative over the age of 25, male attitudes were generally positive for all but the 15-17 age
range. As the study used self-report survey data these differences in attitude could have
impacted how individuals reported harms.

Culture

Ten studies include data on culture, and these are largely focused on investigating only
one group, or comparing indigenous people with migrants to a society. Although direct
comparison is not possible given the majority of studies found within this search some
estimates, and inferences can be made.
Kolandai-Matchett et al[60] found that Pacific New Zealand people experienced
gambling through collectivist cultural values, meaning that additional harm dimensions were
present. Some of the listed cultural harms include a loss of belonging or isolation, shame; loss
of the community’s respect; disruption of trusting relationships; transference of communal
responsibilities; and an overall loss of social cohesion. In a quotation from one of the
interviewed participants the researchers noted that non-present or non-contributing members
of the society may be excluded by the wider collective.
Breen[50] studied indigenous Australians and found that one key harm was the neglect
of children when a parent gambles, and the eldest daughter would become their main care
giver. They also found that many people would gamble within a group, increasing their
behaviour, but they would feel shame from losses and from the potential gossip within their
close community, and Breen, Hing and Gordon[48] also found that a large concern for
Indigenous Australians was the spread of a harms impact throughout the community. The
range of harms shown within indigenous Australian communities included gambling away
their pensions, relationship issues [48], betting above their means, guilt and shame, and
chasing losses [62]. And to a lesser extent financial harms like borrowing money or selling
items, and health problems.
McCarthy et al[58] suggested that women from ethnic minorities, indigenous
communities and specifically Maori and Pacific women in New Zealand were more
vulnerable to gambling harms than European women. Ferrara, Franceschini and Corsello[43]
found that non-white males were most at risk of developing a gambling problem, and, in the

UK, Wardle et al[61] found that although migrants were less likely to gamble they were more
likely to experience harms than individuals born in the country. By contrast, Currie et al[42]
found that white men were more likely to report harms, and are more likely to gamble
overall, with a higher frequency and higher spends.
The final study that investigated culture is that of Goh, Ng and Yeoh[57] who found that
families in Singapore were at risk of acute financial harms when the problem gambler was a
parent. Most households suffered double financial harms through loss of income and large
debt, and when the gambler was a mother without income the father would leave employment
to care for the children, resulting in an income reduction for the entire household. Goh, Ng
and Yeoh also found that many people in Singapore viewed gamblers as self-centred, and
siblings would often give up on them, rather than accepting problem gambling as an illness.

Gambling Behaviour
One of the most predictable influences on gambling harms is the specific gambling
habits and behaviours of the individual. Twelve studies include data on gambling behaviours
and several studies have agreed that a higher frequency of play, and higher amount of
spending per session, leads to more harms [45, 41, 42, 47, 33, 63].
Some studies have found links between the quantity of harms and the choice of game
type. Castren et al[41] found that six out of twelve game type predictors were associated with
more harmful consequences, including scratch games, betting, slot machines, non-poker
online games, online poker, and non-monopoly games. They found that lottery play caused
the lowest number of harms, and this finding is consistent with findings reported by Currie et
al[42] who found that frequency of play on lottery games did not increase the harms
experienced, whereas electronic gambling machines, ticket gambling, bingo and casino
games did. Ronzitti et al[44] also concluded that Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and casino

tables were associated with the highest scores on the PGSI, and gambling machines showed
high PGSI scores compared to other methods of play, despite similar play times.
Two studies within the search looked at motivations for gambling, and although
Browne et al[40] found no link between motivation of play and harms, Lee, Chung and
Bernhard[55] found that excitement, escape and challenge motives were linked with positive
outcomes, but financial motivation led to harms. Lloyd et al[36] also found that self-harm
thoughts were associated with money as a motivator but was negatively associated with
enjoyment motivations.

Online vs. Offline Gambling
As well as specific game type five studies look at the broader categories of online or
offline gambling. Castren et al[41] found only a weak link between online gambling and an
increase in harms, however Gainsbury, Abarbanel and Blaszcynski[14] found that online
gamblers tended to have higher PGSI scores. Moreover, online gamblers were more varied in
their choice of game and gambling behaviours, and in comparison to offline gamblers they
showed no preference for skill-based games.
Yani-de-Soriano, Javed and Yousafzai[64] found that online gambling was associated
with binge drinking, cigarette smoking and an increased risk of developing problem
gambling. However, they did not find a link between online gambling and what they label as
internet addiction. Huberts and Griffiths[52] also found a link between online gambling and
alcohol dependence, and they discovered that online gamblers were less likely to have jobs,
children and a stable relationship, leading to unemployment and less money later in life. They
further found that online gamblers were less able to control impulsivity and frustration, but
despite this they had fewer suicidal thoughts than offline gamblers, although actual suicide
attempts were comparable in both groups.

Feelings of shame appeared to be lower in online gamblers relative to offline gamblers
[65]

, and it was suggested that online gamblers feel less judged since their behaviours could be

more secretive and private. Despite these reduced feelings of shame Fulton observed that
secretive gambling increased financial harms due to the likelihood of concealed debt; and by
living a double life secretive gamblers experienced increased stress, relationship conflicts,
and emotional deterioration.

Socioeconomic Status
There were eight studies that examined socioeconomic factors affecting gambling
harms, and the consensus appears to be that less affluent socioeconomic groups are more at
risk of experiencing harms than more affluent groups. Ferrara, Franceschini and Corsello[43]
found that individuals in routine socioeconomic groups were at the highest risk of developing
an addiction to gambling, and Currie et al[42] concluded that participants who reported harms
were more likely to be in a lower income bracket, and to have received no further education
than high school.
Skaal et al[35] reported that urban residents were more likely to report psychological
distress and be at a high risk of problem gambling on the PGSI. In comparison harms were
associated with employment status in peri-urban areas, with unemployment doubling the risk
of problem gambling. Browne et al[40] found that income and education level are indirect risk
factors of harm, and Lloyd et al[36] found that gambling related thoughts of self-harm were
more prevalent in the unemployed.
Lee, Chung and Bernhard[55] reported that married people with a low income are more
likely to be financially motivated to gamble, and this motivation could be associated with
greater harms. Lloyd et al[36], however, found no link between problem gambling and marital
status.

Health Inequality in Gambling - 22
In an apparent contrast with other results, Tu, Gray and Walton[66] found that people in
managerial or professional occupations appeared more likely to participate in gambling than
people in routine occupations. However, although gambling rates in the most affluent groups
dropped during times of recession, the rates within deprived communities did not, suggesting
that less wealthy people may be more likely to gamble in times of economic stress. When
controlling for confounding variables the most deprived groups were 4.5 times as likely to
experience a gambling-related argument or money issues as people living in the least
deprived areas.

Other Factors
Studies that examined unique factors affecting harms include Jeffrey et al[67] who
compared gamblers with their partners and found that gamblers were more likely to report
individual harms that affect themselves. They also found that gamblers identified a wider
range of harms and were better at identifying harms than their partners. This suggests that as
well as experiencing more harms than affected others, gamblers are more aware of those
harms and therefore may be more consciously impacted. Li et al[37] also found that harms in
all areas accumulated more quickly in gamblers than in affected others.
Langham et al[68] found that an individuals’ sense of coherence correlated strongly with
gambling harms. Sense of coherence is defined as the extent to which someone feels
confident in the predictability of their environment, and that things will generally turn out as
expected.
Binde[69] looked specifically at harms in the context of an individual’s place of work
and found that signs of a problem gambler at work included excessive talk on gambling,
gambling during breaks or during work time, borrowing money from colleagues, poor work
performance, lateness or absence and more. Despite this they did not compare different levels

of employment or types of job role that could have provided a more thorough view of
gambling harms and employment.
May-Chahal et al[70] investigated harms within the British prison population and found
that although the prevalence of problem gambling in terms of the PGSI was higher in prisons,
the prevalence of gambling behaviour prior to incarceration was significantly lower. They
found that there was no link between PGSI score and criminal career, and no statistical link
between gambling and drug use, however high rate offenders in their mid-20s were 5.3 times
more likely to be frequent loss chasers than other categories. May-Chahal also found that
occasional gamblers were less likely to use alcohol or drugs in prison, with nearly 2/3 of the
problem gambling group abstaining completely from substance use. The researchers suggest
that this may be because the individuals’ ‘addiction needs’ are being met by their gambling
behaviour.
Three studies also looked at how gambling harms present within a family unit, or how
an individuals’ home life may impact their gambling. Anderson, Rempusheski and Leedy[71]
examined senior family members and found that co-dependency within the family, where
each person was expected to bail the other out, caused relationship breakdowns, stress and
tension. Some participants expressed shame at spending their children’s trust funds or
savings, however participants also reported using the addiction model to neutralize shame
and guilt. Ferrara, Franceschini and Corsello[43] and Larsen, Curtis and Bjerregaard[49] both
found that an individuals’ home life affected their gambling habits. Ferrara, Franceschini and
Corsello stated that having separated parents increased the risk of gambling later in life, and
Larsen, Curtis and Bjerregaard found that the odds of showing one or more addictive
behaviours increased in households without children. Perhaps suggesting that the presence of
a traditional nuclear family unit is a protective factor against gambling harms.

DISCUSSION
The results presented here suggest that there may be a health inequality in gambling
harms, as several studies have found differences in the number and types of harms reported in
different social groups. Although further analysis and investigation is necessary for a
complete understanding of the distribution of gambling harms in society, the results suggest
that there are differences which are dependent upon several factors. Studies such as Wardle et
al[61], Salonen, Alho and Castren[59] and Tu, Gray and Walton[66] pose a particular concern as
there are suggestions that certain groups experience more harms even when gambling less,
presenting a health inequality which needs to be understood and addressed. In particular
several studies report differences between age groups, socioeconomic status, and gambling
behaviour or play styles.
In applying the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria [25] we found that several studies
were not robust in their quality control (Figure 2). In particular studies scoring below 0.5 on
the assessment may not be an accurate representation of gambling harms, whereas studies
which scored above 0.95 may present the most reliable data on harm distribution (Table 3).

The most commonly reported factor in these highly rated studies was the prevention
paradox, and all studies included which discuss this found evidence in favour of the paradox.
The findings showed that the majority of harm impact is found in the lower PGSI rated
groups, due to the larger population numbers in these categories. However, they also found
that the highest severity of harm, such as substance use or severe psychological distress, was
most often found in the problem gambling group.

All but one [59] of these high rated studies found no differences in harm presentation
between genders and reported that in all age groups males gambled more often than females
with higher frequency of play and higher spends. In contrast Salonen, Alho and Castren
found that occasional gambling increased in women 18-24 between the years 2011 and 2015,
and only females felt more harms despite men 18-24 also increasing their gambling
behaviour. Any other differences in harm profile between genders has been explained by
behavioural differences as the odds of reporting harm increased substantially with greater
time of play and spends, and daily gamblers were significantly more likely to report all
different harms when compared to other gambling groups.
All but two studies [21, 36] investigating age found significant differences across groups,
with the majority of harms and dysfunctional symptomology reported in ages below 30.
Online gamblers were found to be more frequently 16-20 years old and online gambling was
highly associated with heavy alcohol use, and poor academic functioning.
It was also found that gambling related thoughts of self-harm were more common
among the unemployed, and that individuals from urban areas were more likely to report
psychological distress and increased alcohol use from gambling. In peri-urban areas
employment status was associated with high scores on the PGSI and unemployed gamblers
had double the odds of scoring as a problem gambler than those who were employed.
Several of these highly rated studies identified trait impulsivity as a common risk factor
in gambling, and it was found that impulsivity mediated the link between harms and age or
gender. Sense of coherence was also found to significantly correlate with gambling harms,
with a weaker sense of coherence leading to increased harms. Along with impulsivity, sense
of coherence could point to a personality type which increases the risk of harms from
gambling. And evidence has shown that impulsivity is high in younger age groups, who
appear to display more gambling harms than older individuals.

The final high rated study [55] found that motivations of excitement, escape and
challenge were linked to positive outcomes from gambling, whereas money as a motivator
led to harmful consequences. Despite this another highly rated study [40] found that an
individual’s reason to gamble, or motivation, had no impact on harms and so further research
is needed to confirm or deny this association.
It was stated by Susana Jiménez Murcia that, “we need to use different treatments for
each sub-group of pathological gamblers” [70]. Murcia is the co-author of a study which found
that there are four distinct types of gambler [71]. The team concluded that out of the four subtypes only one category of gambler suggested significant pathology, though all were
compulsive with differing severity levels, comorbidity and personality profiles. Future
research could investigate not only the distribution of harms across society, but also further
understand these sub-types of gambler, attribute these to specific groups or personality
profiles, and compare and validate the results against this previous work. This future research
should also broaden the participant base as Álvarez-Moya et al only investigated selfreporting slot machine gamblers, meaning their results may not be complete, or may not be
generalizable.
To conclude, our review strongly suggests that the distribution of harms in the
population is affected by a number of factors and presents some key signs to identify
individuals who may be at risk. However, further research is needed to fully understand
gambling harms and to confirm which individuals and groups are most at risk.

Most frequent harms were ‘gambling
more than one intended to’ (poor selfcontrol), ‘going back another day to win
back money’ (chasing losses) and ‘feeling
guilty’. Chasing losses was most typical
harm in online poker and fast-paced daily
lottery games. Poor self-control was most
typical harm with all other game types.

When using degree of severity scale there
did not appear to be very much harm in
LR, with harms only appearing in PG.
LR-MR show low-medium harms.
Despite this studies show a larger
proportion of harm within low-risk
gamblers (prevention paradox.) This study
argues that correct scaling of harm is not
being used as shame is not equal in
severity to suicide. However, the main
harm which evidences the paradox is
financial harms which shows even the
more severe harms such as selling
belongings in the low-category.
The researchers argue that this may be
due to low SES in the non-PG/low risk
category and that it is hard to confidently
attribute these financial harms to
gambling, Particularly as many LR nonPG participants score 0 on the PGSI
suggesting little to no gambling

Some children believed gambling was
almost compulsory for Australians during
big events, and most could see the fun that
may be felt when winning. Children
didn’t seem to perceive any harms other
than peer pressure and financial loss.
However studies have shown childhood
exposure to gambling can increase the
likelihood of alcoholism and cigarette use.
Due to children believing sport betting
was based on skill and experiencing
minimal harms at such as young age
through family protection they are more
likely to experience harm in later life.
Only children who saw harms to their
parents appeared to be wary of gambling
and unsure if they would try it themselves.

However, the mean level of harm for all

less than one empirically defined unit.
The distribution pattern of averaged
