Abstract

11

Background Asymmetric gait post-stroke is associated with decreased mobility, yet individuals with chronic stroke

12

often self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking more symmetrically. The purpose of this study

13

was to test whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy cost minimization. We hypothesized that

14

short-term deviations from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic energy consumption,

15

despite being associated with long-term rehabilitation benefits. Other studies have found no difference in metabolic

16

rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry among individuals with chronic stroke, but used methods that left

17

some uncertainty to be resolved.

18

Methods In this study, ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at participant-specific speeds while

19

voluntarily modulating step length asymmetry. We included only participants with significant self-selected

20

asymmetry who were able to significantly alter asymmetry using visual biofeedback. Conditions included targeting

21

zero asymmetry, self-selected asymmetry, and double the self-selected asymmetry. Participants were trained with

22

the biofeedback system in one session, and data were collected in three subsequent sessions with repeated measures.

23

Self-selected asymmetry was consistent across sessions. A similar protocol was conducted among unimpaired

24

participants.

25

Results Participants with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry using biofeedback, but this did

26

not affect metabolic rate (ANOVA, p = 0.8). In unimpaired participants, self-selected step length asymmetry was

27

close to zero and corresponded to the lowest energy cost (ANOVA, p = 6e-4). While the symmetry of unimpaired

28

gait may be the result of energy cost minimization, self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic

29

stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive.

30

Conclusions Interventions that encourage changes in step length asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy

31

consumption may be effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a metabolic penalty for altering

32

asymmetry.

Background
Stroke often results in hemiparesis and gait asymmetries, such as spatial, temporal, or kinematic differences

39

between the paretic and nonparetic legs(1–3). Asymmetric gait post-stroke has been associated with slower walking

40

speeds(4) and higher metabolic energy consumption(5,6) compared to unimpaired walking. Conventional gait

41

retraining by physical therapists can reduce gait asymmetries, particularly step length asymmetry, and improve

42

speed and energy economy, but sessions are costly, limiting access. More automated rehabilitation techniques to

43

reduce step length asymmetry have been developed using split-belt treadmills(7–9) or rehabilitation robots(10,11).

44

These interventions, however, have not been more effective than conventional physiotherapy for individuals with

45

chronic stroke(8,11–15). A better understanding of the mechanisms driving step length asymmetry in individuals

46

with chronic stroke could allow for the development of more targeted, effective, and accessible gait interventions.

47

Unimpaired individuals self-select many gait parameters, such as step frequency(16), step width(17), and

48

even arm swinging characteristics(18), to minimize their energy cost of walking, a strategy that might also explain

49

self-selected asymmetries in post-stroke gait. Deviations from self-selected gait tend to lead to an increase in energy

50

expenditure, creating bowl-like relationships, or cost landscapes, between energy cost and gait parameters, with the

51

energy minimum at the self-selected parameter value(19). The relationship between step length asymmetry and

52

metabolic rate has not yet been characterized in unimpaired individuals, but studies that enforce absolute differences

53

in step length(20) or asymmetry in step time(21) suggest that they self-select nearly symmetric step lengths that

54

correspond to a lower energy cost than asymmetric gait. Because stroke often leads to physical asymmetries, such as

55

paretic leg muscle weakness(22), muscle spasticity(23), or reduced paretic-leg push-off force(24,25), an asymmetric

56

gait could be metabolically optimal for individuals with chronic stroke. On the other hand, factors other than effort

57

minimization, such as perceived effort, avoidance of fatigue, comfort, or stability, could be primarily responsible for

58

the observed step length asymmetry in this population.

59

The effects of acutely changing step length asymmetry may differ from those of slowly changing step

60

length asymmetry through the process of rehabilitation. Long-term rehabilitation interventions that decrease gait

61

asymmetry have shown that cost of transport often improves concurrently(26). However, other effects of long-term

62

rehabilitation, such as increased muscle strength(27) or improved motor control, may enable individuals to walk

63

with reduced asymmetry more efficiently. Therefore, acute reductions in gait asymmetry that are not accompanied

64

by the neuro-musculoskeletal changes often seen in long-term rehabilitation may not correlate with improvements in

65

walking economy. Even for individuals who walk with highly asymmetric gaits, their self-selected asymmetry may

66

be the most energy efficient one, and acute changes in gait asymmetry could still lead to increased energy

67

consumption.

68

Step length asymmetry is changed acutely during split-belt walking, but this task change may also change

69

the optimal step length asymmetry. When belt speeds are matched immediately following split-belt training, step

70

length asymmetry is acutely changed, but this washout effect does not persist long enough to collect steady-state

71

metabolic rate measurements(28). To determine whether self-selected gait asymmetry minimizes energy cost, gait

72

asymmetry would need to be varied independently from other factors affecting metabolic energy consumption,

73

within an individual participant, while metabolic rate is measured.

74

Previous studies measured metabolic rate while individuals with chronic stroke acutely altered step length

75

asymmetry and step length difference using biofeedback(20,29). These studies found no difference in metabolic rate

76

between self-selected and altered step length asymmetries in stroke survivors. However, some uncertainty remains

77

to be resolved. Each prior study included participants with self-selected step length asymmetry values close to zero.

78

This makes differentiating between the potential optimality of self-selected asymmetry and that of absolute

79

symmetry difficult. Prior studies also included some participants who were unable to reliably alter step length

80

asymmetry, so asymmetry values in different conditions could have been similar. This can reduce the power of a

81

numerical analysis intended to identify an effect of step length asymmetry on metabolic rate. In prior studies,

82

participants were instructed to hold onto the treadmill handrails to help with stability and minimize fall risk.

83

However, participants could have relied more heavily on the handrails during more difficult conditions to improve

84

stability or to help maintain the correct speed. Both improved balance(30,31) and handrail holding(32) during

85

treadmill walking have been shown to reduce metabolic energy consumption. To minimize the amount of walking

86

and number of experimental sessions for participants with chronic stroke, participants in these studies were

87

familiarized with the biofeedback on the same day as the data collection. However, motor learning can have an

88

effect on metabolic rate during a novel task; as individuals learn a new task, metabolic power(33,34) and muscle

89

activity(35) typically decrease, with steady state reached after hours or days of practice. For example, Sánchez et al.

90

recently showed that split-belt treadmill training takes longer than originally thought(36), and training over multiple

91

sessions can facilitate better learning because memory consolidation occurs during sleep(37).

92

The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between step length asymmetry and

93

metabolic energy consumption during walking in individuals with chronic stroke and unimpaired individuals. We

94

screened for individuals with chronic stroke who exhibited clinically meaningful self-selected step length

95

asymmetry, so as to differentiate between the potential optimality of self-selected asymmetry and perfect symmetry.

96

Only participants who could substantially alter their asymmetry with biofeedback were included, which ensured that

97

the effects of changes in asymmetry could be robustly analyzed. We disallowed participants from using handrails

98

during all conditions to avoid uncertainty related to the potential benefits of improved balance or forward pulling

99

during more difficult conditions. Participants with chronic stroke received training on the biofeedback system during

100

the first session to facilitate task learning and ensure that all participants could alter their baseline asymmetry with

101

biofeedback. Data were collected in three subsequent sessions. During each collection session, conditions were

102

presented in a different order to avoid ordering effects, and the first condition of the session was repeated to reduce

103

within-session training effects. We hypothesized that individuals with chronic stroke would self-select the step

104

length asymmetry that minimized their metabolic energy consumption during walking, and that more symmetric or

105

asymmetric gaits would result in a higher metabolic cost. We hypothesized that unimpaired individuals would self-

106

select the step length asymmetry, near symmetric, that minimized their metabolic cost, and more asymmetric gaits

107

would increase metabolic cost. The results from this study were expected to improve our understanding of the

108

mechanisms driving self-selected step length asymmetry and influence the development of new gait retraining

109

techniques.

110
111

Methods

112

We conducted an experiment in which we asked individuals with chronic stroke and unimpaired participants to alter

113

their step length asymmetry using biofeedback while walking on an instrumented treadmill at a participant specific

114

speed. Participants were first familiarized with the biofeedback system and practiced walking in conditions targeting

115

a variety of asymmetry levels. Data collection trials followed familiarization. Participants walked in each

116

biofeedback condition for six minutes, and metabolic rate measurements were collected. Rest breaks were given

117

between each walking bout. Participants wore a safety harness that did not provide body weight support. Participants

118

were instructed not to hold onto the treadmill handrail unless they felt like they might lose their balance. All

120

122

Biofeedback

123

Biofeedback was used to enforce various step length asymmetries (Figure 1A). Participants were provided with a

124

visual representation of the step length targets (Figure 1B). Bars on the screen grew in proportion to the forward

125

position of the lateral malleolus of the swing leg with respect to the ankle of the standing leg. Participants were

126

asked to heel strike onto the treadmill when the bar reached the target. Each target allowed for 2.5 cm of error either

127

ahead of or behind the targeted step length value. As an incentive, the step length target would explode when the

128

participant hit it (Figure 1C). If the participant missed the target, the target would turn red (Figure 1D). In both

129

cases, a yellow line would appear to show the participant’s step length as additional feedback for the next step.

130

During the last three minutes, the number of targets hit was displayed to further motivate participants. Different step

131

length asymmetries were achieved by adjusting the step length targets while keeping the summation of paretic and

132

nonparetic step lengths (or left and right step lengths for the unimpaired participants) constant to enforce a fixed

133

stride length across conditions.

accurately detect left and right heel strikes. Reflective markers were attached to the ankles to measure step length at
heel strike. (B) Example asymmetry conditions for individuals with chronic stroke. Both left and right step length
targets were adjusted to achieve the correct step length asymmetry while keeping the summation of left and right
step lengths constant. (C) An example of a step that hit the target. As the right leg moved forward, the gray bar grew
proportionally. The participant’s heel strike occurred when the gray bar reached the step length target, and the target
exploded to indicate correct step length. The yellow bar for the right leg changed position to show where the step
length occurred for the next right step length. (D) An example of a step that missed the target. As the participant
moved the left leg forward, the left gray bar grew proportionally. The participant’s heel strike was before the target,
and the target turned red. The yellow bar was adjusted to show the left step length, indicating to the participant to
take a longer left step.

Demographics of participants with chronic stroke

148

Twenty-eight individuals with chronic stroke (>6 months) were enrolled in this study, of which ten met the inclusion

149

criteria (Table 1). To participate in this study, individuals had to: be capable of walking unassisted, aside from the

150

use of an ankle foot orthosis; have sustained only one previous stroke; and have no other neurological disorders. We

151

were interested in identifying the relationship between step length asymmetry and metabolic cost in individuals with

152

chronic stroke who self-selected a clinically relevant step length asymmetry when they had the capacity to

153

voluntarily alter asymmetry. Therefore, participants were excluded from the study if: they did not have a clinically

154

meaningful step length asymmetry, defined as at least 4%, which is greater than the average step length asymmetry

155

of unimpaired individuals(2); they were unable to alter step length asymmetry with biofeedback; they felt

156

uncomfortable walking on the treadmill; or they were unable to walk without holding the treadmill handrail.

157
158

Demographics of unimpaired participants

159

Ten unimpaired individuals participated in the study as the control group (Table 2). To be included in the study,

160

participants had to have no history of neurological disorders and be comfortable walking on a treadmill without

161

holding the handrails.

162
163

Testing Paradigm for participants with chronic stroke.

164

Individuals with chronic stroke participated in four experimental sessions over four days. The first session included

165

treadmill and biofeedback familiarization, exclusion criteria implementation, and clinical testing (Figure 2 S1).

166

Sessions two through four consisted of refamiliarization with the biofeedback system and data collection (Figure 2

167

S2-S4). Individuals with chronic stroke experienced three biofeedback conditions which targeted self-selected

168

asymmetry, zero asymmetry, and exaggerated asymmetry, defined as twice their self-selected asymmetry. Rest

169

breaks were given between every walking bout until blood pressure and heart rate returned to baseline

170

measurements, typically about five minutes.

171
172

Familiarization and speed selection (Session 1). The first session involved selecting an appropriate speed for each

173

participant and familiarizing participants with treadmill walking and the biofeedback system. Participants first

174

completed a six-minute walk test to determine their maximum average over-ground walking speed(38,39).

175

Participants were then familiarized with treadmill walking. During treadmill familiarization (TM familiar. in Figure

176

2 S1), participants first walked at 25% of their maximum over-ground speed. The speed was then increased to 50%

177

of their over-ground speed, and then gradually increased to 100% in 10% increments, with each speed held for about

184

1 minute or until the participant was comfortable with increasing the speed, indicated through verbal consent. The

185

speed selection protocol (described in the section “Speed selection for participants with chronic stroke”) was then

186

conducted to identify a speed that was comfortable and sustainable, based on biological measurements, and at which

187

participants could still alter step length asymmetry.

188

Self-selected asymmetry was then measured at the selected speed. Participants walked on the treadmill at

189

the selected speed for six minutes. To reduce the effects of outlier steps, the median asymmetry of the last three

190

minutes of walking was used as the self-selected step length asymmetry. Participants who did not exhibit a self-

191

selected step length asymmetry of at least 4% at the selected speed were excluded from the rest of the study.

192

Asymmetric participants were then trained on the biofeedback system. A slide presentation explaining the

193

task was given to participants. To translate the instructions to the actual task, participants were first exposed to two

194

minutes of walking while targeting their self-selected asymmetry using the biofeedback system described

195

previously. Participants then trained for six minutes in each biofeedback condition (zero, self-selected, and

196

exaggerated) presented in a randomized order. Participants were encouraged to ask questions throughout training.

197

Verbal reinforcement and coaching were provided to participants to help improve accuracy and motivation. No

198

metabolic data were collected during training to allow for easier communication. If participants were unable to alter

199

their step length asymmetry with biofeedback, they were excluded from the rest of the experiment.

200

Clinical tests were also applied during the first session to determine the level of neurological impairment. A

201

mini-mental cognitive test was conducted following speed selection. A timed up and go test (TUG) and a lower

202

extremity Fugl-Meyer (LEFM) assessment were conducted at the end of the session.

203
204

Refamiliarization and data collection trials (Sessions 2-4). Once individuals were familiarized with the task in the

205

first session, metabolic rate and kinematic data were collected over three sessions. Asymmetry conditions were

206

presented in pseudorandom order (Figure 2 S2-S4) to reduce potential ordering effects on metabolic cost. All

207

walking bouts were on the treadmill at the speed selected during the first session. Each session began with a four-

208

minute quiet standing trial to measure resting metabolic rate. Participants then walked for six minutes without

209

biofeedback while their self-selected asymmetry and baseline metabolic rate for the session were measured.

210

Participants were subsequently given two minutes of refamiliarization in each of the three biofeedback conditions in

211

the experimental order of the session. Following refamiliarization, participants walked in each asymmetry condition,

212

with biofeedback, for six minutes. Metabolic rate, kinematic, and kinetic data were measured simultaneously. The

213

order of the three biofeedback conditions was randomized during session two, and the first condition was repeated to

214

assess whether trial order had an effect during the course of the session. Only data from the second exposure were

215

included in the analysis. The randomized order of conditions during session two was labeled as A-B-C-A. During

216

sessions three and four, the order of the conditions was reordered to B-C-A-B and C-A-B-C, respectively, so that all

217

conditions would be presented first to ensure equal exposure to all conditions and reduce potential ordering effects

218

on metabolic cost.

219
220

Testing paradigm for unimpaired participants

221

Unimpaired individuals participated in one session which included biofeedback familiarization and data collection

222

(Figure 2 U1). One session was used because unimpaired individuals exhibited consistent trends over multiple days

223

during pilot testing. Unimpaired participants completed symmetric and exaggerated walking conditions using the

224

same biofeedback system as the participants with chronic stroke. Exaggerated asymmetries were based on the

225

measured step length asymmetry in participants with chronic stroke. Short breaks were given between each

226

condition to reset the equipment.

227
228

Familiarization and speed selection. Unimpaired individuals were familiarized with the biofeedback system but did

229

not require treadmill familiarization given their experience walking on a treadmill. All participants walked at 1.25

230

m/s, a comfortable speed for unimpaired individuals walking on a treadmill(40). The experiment began with a four-

231

minute quiet standing trial to measure resting metabolic rate. Unimpaired participants then walked for three minutes

232

without biofeedback to calculate self-selected step lengths for the biofeedback system. Self-selected step lengths for

233

the right and left legs were taken as the median values from the last minute of the trial.

234

Unimpaired participants were then familiarized with the biofeedback system. Participants were first given a

235

slide presentation. Participants were then exposed to each of the five biofeedback conditions for two minutes in

236

random order. They were encouraged to ask questions during the familiarization period.

237

Different target asymmetries were used in the unimpaired group because self-selected asymmetry was

238

typically close to 0%. Target asymmetries were based on the step length asymmetries measured among the

239

participants with chronic stroke. To select target asymmetries, we first found the absolute change in measured step

Speed selection for participants with chronic stroke

263

We developed and applied an elaborate protocol to identify the speed at which each participant with chronic stroke

264

could walk for six minutes while modulating step length asymmetry without exceeding limits on heart rate or

265

respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Participants walked on a treadmill for a maximum of nine minutes during the

266

speed selection protocol. Metabolic rate, heart rate, and respiratory exchange ratio (the ratio of carbon dioxide

267

production to oxygen consumption) were collected. We then performed calculations to determine the speeds at

268

which heart rate exceeded a safe value or respiratory exchange ratio indicated the potential for anaerobic energy

269

consumption (Figure 3).

270

In the first three minutes, participants walked at 25% of the over-ground speed measured in the six-minute

271

walk test to collect their baseline biological measurements. Treadmill speed was then linearly increased to 100% of

272

their over-ground speed during the next three minutes. For the final three minutes, speed was held constant at the

273

participant’s over-ground speed to test whether the participant could sustain that speed. The speed selection was

274

stopped if: the participant’s heart rate exceeded 90% of their maximum heart rate; their respiratory exchange ratio

275

reached 1.1 indicating anaerobic respiration; they could not walk without holding the handrail; or they requested to

276

stop because of pain.

277

We then calculated the delay in metabolic response to the increasing treadmill speed (Figure 3A). The

278

baseline metabolic cost of walking was computed as the average cost during minutes two and three. As treadmill

279

speed linearly increased, metabolic rate also increased, but with a time delay(28). This time delay was approximated

280

by fitting a linear regression to the metabolic cost during minutes four to six. The delay was quantified as the time

281

difference between the onset of the speed increase at minute three and the time when the linear regression reached a

282

5% increase from the average baseline metabolic rate.

283

The maximum sustainable speed was determined using thresholds on heart rate and respiratory exchange

284

ratio. Linear regressions were fit to the heart rate data between minutes four to six and seven to nine because of the

285

different speed profiles (Figure 3B). Based on pilot testing, we set the threshold for heart rate at 78% of the

286

participants’ maximum heart rate, defined as 220 bpm minus their age in years. An exponential curve was fit to the

287

respiratory exchange ratio data between minutes two and the end of the trial (Figure 3C). The baseline respiratory

288

exchange ratio was calculated as the average of the exponential curve between minutes two and three. The threshold

289

for respiratory exchange ratio was the larger of either a 5% increase from the baseline respiratory exchange ratio or a

290

respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8. The times when the fits of heart rate and respiratory exchange ratio reached the

291

thresholds were calculated, and the metabolic time delay was subtracted. Treadmill speed at the earlier of the two

292

times was determined (Figure 3D). Based on pilot tests, we found than an additional 25% decrease in speed was

293

required to allow for increased exertion when modulating step length asymmetry.

Figure 3 Example speed selection protocol for participants with chronic stroke. (A) Metabolic rate used to find
time delay in body’s response time. The baseline metabolic rate was the average rate between minutes two and
three. Data were fit with linear regression between minutes four to six. The time the regression crossed the 5%
increase in metabolic rate was found. The time delay was the difference between the threshold crossing and the
onset of the treadmill speed increase. (B) Linear regressions on heart rate data to find time when heart rate reaches
the 78% maximum heart rate threshold. The time delay was subtracted from the time the heart rate regression
crossed the threshold. The heart rate did not cross the threshold in this participant. (C) Exponential model fit
between minutes two to nine on respiratory exchange ratio. The threshold for respiratory exchange ratio was the
larger of 0.8 respiratory exchange ratio or a 5% increase from baseline respiratory exchange ratio. The time delay
was subtracted from the time the exponential fit crossed the threshold. (D) Normalized treadmill speed throughout
the protocol to map threshold times to speed. 75% of the lower speed between respiratory exchange ratio and heart

Measurements collected

310

Kinematic and kinetic data. Ankle locations were collected by tracking reflective markers attached to the lateral

311

malleoli with a passive motion analysis system sampling at 100 Hz (Vicon Motion Systems, Oxford, UK). Vertical

312

ground reaction forces measured by the instrumented treadmill at 1000 Hz (Bertec Corporation, Columbus, OH)

313

were used to detect heel strike (Fz > 10N) and toe-off (Fz < 10N).

314
315

Metabolic rate and heart rate. Metabolic rate was indirectly calculated by measuring the rate of oxygen consumed

316

and rate of carbon dioxide produced using a mobile respirometry system (Oxycon Mobile; CareFusion, San Diego,

317

CA or Cosmed K4b2, Rome, Italy) and applying a standard equation(41). Respiratory exchange ratio was also

318

calculated using these data. Heart rate was measured using a transmitting electrocardiogram (T31 Coded

319

Transmitter; Polar, Kempele, Finland).

320
321

Data processing and analysis

322

Step length asymmetry. Step length asymmetry was calculated using the location of the ankles at each heel strike.

323

Step length was defined as the distance between the leading- and trailing-leg ankle markers at heel strike. Paretic

324

and nonparetic step lengths were defined when the respective leg was leading at heel strike.

325
326

Step length asymmetry was calculated as the normalized difference between the step lengths of the paretic
and nonparetic limb(42,43):

327

𝑆𝐿𝐴=

𝑆𝐿NP − 𝑆𝐿P
∙ 100%
𝑆𝐿NP + 𝑆𝐿P

328

where SLA is step length asymmetry, SL p is the step length of the paretic leg, and SL NP is the step length of the non-

329

paretic leg. For unimpaired controls, left and right step lengths were used instead of paretic and nonparetic step

330

lengths. Step length asymmetry was measured by averaging the step length asymmetries over the last three minutes

331

of each walking bout.

332
333

Metabolic cost. Volumetric flow rates were measured breath-by-breath and averaged over ten second intervals. We

334

used the average metabolic rate of the last three minutes of each condition. Net metabolic rate was calculated by

335

subtracting the average metabolic rate during quiet standing from the average metabolic rate during each walking

336

condition.

Normalization of data and statistical analysis. For the population with chronic stroke, step length asymmetry was

339

normalized to self-selected asymmetry without biofeedback. Step length asymmetry was not normalized for the

340

unimpaired controls because their self-selected asymmetry was close to 0%. Metabolic rate was normalized to body

341

mass for each participant. Percent change in metabolic rate was calculated by comparing the average metabolic rate

342

measured during each biofeedback condition to the average metabolic rate of the self-selected asymmetry without

343

biofeedback condition. Each session was normalized separately. In all statistical analyses, only the biofeedback

344

conditions were compared.

345

Statistical comparisons were made for step length asymmetry and metabolic rate across biofeedback

346

conditions. Average percent change in metabolic rate and measured step length asymmetry for each condition were

347

tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To test whether measured step length asymmetry and

348

metabolic rate differed across biofeedback conditions, we performed three-way ANOVA (random effects:

349

participant and session; fixed effect: biofeedback condition, treated as categorical). If significance was found, paired

350

t-tests were performed to compare biofeedback conditions. We also tested whether metabolic rate was correlated

351

with measured step length asymmetry according to a quadratic model, using regression analysis. Significance for

352

comparisons was set at α = 0.05.

individuals with chronic stroke significantly altered their step length asymmetry with biofeedback from an average

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to test whether minimizing metabolic rate could explain self-selected step

400

length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke. We conducted a study in which we asked participants to alter

401

their step length asymmetry while measuring their metabolic cost. We found that minimizing metabolic cost does

402

not seem to explain self-selected step length asymmetry in participants with chronic stroke; no differences in

403

metabolic rate were seen across asymmetry levels. To test whether the lack of relationship between step length

404

asymmetry and metabolic rate was related to stroke, we performed a similar experiment on unimpaired individuals.

405

Unimpaired participants self-selected a low step length asymmetry which corresponded to their energy minimum.

406

These findings suggest that, after a stroke, factors other than metabolic rate minimization drive self-selected step

407

length asymmetry.

408
409
410

Metabolic rate
Previous studies have shown that changing gait parameters affects metabolic rate in unimpaired

411

participants. People will usually self-select a gait near their energy minimum, and small changes in their gait

412

typically lead to increases in metabolic cost(19). In this study, unimpaired participants exhibited the expected

413

change in metabolic rate with changing step length asymmetries, where changes in asymmetry led to increases in

414

metabolic rate. The participants with chronic stroke included in this study were able to change their step length

415

asymmetry but exhibited a qualitatively different metabolic response. As a group, participants with chronic stroke

416

had similar metabolic cost across step length asymmetry conditions, consistent with previous studies(20,29).

417

Some gait parameters, such as walking speed(44), have energetic cost of transport landscapes with a

418

shallow slope near the energy minimum. In part because the metabolic penalty for walking at speeds near the

419

minimum is small, unimpaired individuals walk with a large variation in self-selected speed(45). While we did not

420

find a significant relationship between metabolic rate and asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke, a shallow

421

energy landscape might exist. This would be difficult to identify given the high variability in kinematics(46) and

422

energy cost exhibited by individual participants walking under the same asymmetry conditions. If a shallow

423

landscape does exist, we do not expect metabolic cost to be the main factor driving step length asymmetry in

424

participants with chronic stroke. If participants with chronic stroke can walk with a wide range of asymmetries

425

without substantially affecting metabolic rate, other optimization goals could dominate, such as increasing

426

stability(47), avoiding fatigue(48,49), or reducing single-support time on their paretic limb(3), resulting in the

427

observed self-selected step length asymmetry.

428

Muscle fatigue avoidance has been shown in simulation to explain some gait patterns in older adults(49),

429

and it might explain self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke. Previous studies have

430

shown that to reduce step length asymmetry, individuals with chronic stroke increase paretic ankle plantarflexor

431

activation(50,51). Paretic plantarflexors might fatigue faster than the nonparetic muscles, so participants could be

432

walking asymmetrically to reduce muscle fatigue.

433

Other forms of asymmetry contribute to step length asymmetry, such as asymmetries in paretic

434

propulsion(25), step position(42), or step timing(21,42). Individuals could have altered step length asymmetry by

435

changing any of these factors, some of which could affect metabolic cost(21). Future studies providing specific

436

feedback to isolate other asymmetries are necessary to examine their correlation with metabolic cost.

437

The metabolic penalty for deviating from self-selected step length asymmetry is larger for unimpaired

438

participants than for participants with chronic stroke. Differences in energy landscape could be due to the

439

differences in speed between these populations. If participants with chronic stroke walked faster, a steeper energy

440

landscape might be found. However, none of the participants with chronic stroke, including two that walked at a

441

speed similar to the walking speed of the unimpaired participants, exhibited a consistent energy landscape.

442
443

Step-length asymmetry modulation

444

While both populations in this study altered their self-selected step length asymmetry, participants with

445

chronic stroke did so to a lesser extent than we requested compared to unimpaired participants. Participants with

446

chronic stroke walked with step length asymmetries farther from the targeted values than the unimpaired

447

participants, suggesting that individuals with chronic stroke had more trouble modulating step length asymmetry.

448

This could be explained by the fact that individuals with chronic stroke have less complex coordination patterns than

449

their unimpaired counterparts(52). The decrease in complexity could reduce the number of coordination strategies

450

available to alter step length asymmetries as more neural signals have become coupled, leading to the observed

451

difficulties.

452
453

Participants with chronic stroke maintained consistent self-selected step length asymmetry across sessions.
Since consistent self-selected step length asymmetry in participants with chronic stroke cannot be explained by

454

energy cost minimization, other factors such as stability(47) muscle weakness(53), or fatigue avoidance(48,49) must

455

be responsible. For example, individuals with chronic stroke often experience diminished control(52), spasticity(23),

456

or muscle weakness(53) of the paretic limb which could cause them to rely less on their paretic leg, leading to the

457

observed consistent self-selected asymmetry. Additional studies should be conducted to identify which of these

458

factors are most important to self-selected step length asymmetry following stroke.

459

Unimpaired participants walked with a step length asymmetry closer to their self-selected asymmetry in all

460

biofeedback conditions, also indicating a step length asymmetry preference. In this case, trying to walk closer to

461

their self-selected asymmetry in the biofeedback conditions can be explained through energy minimization. The

462

more asymmetric unimpaired participants’ step lengths were, the more energy they used. They appeared to have

463

tried to take advantage of the acceptable error allowed in the biofeedback task while still hitting the targets to

464

decrease the effort needed to walk in each asymmetry condition.

465
466

Limitations

467

A limitation of this study is that the unimpaired controls were not age, gender, or speed matched with their post-

468

stroke counterparts. Therefore, we could not isolate the effects that stroke had on changes in metabolic rate and step

469

length asymmetry. However, we wanted to understand if unimpaired adults self-select a step length asymmetry that

470

minimizes their energy cost at a speed they might self-select for themselves to better understand asymmetry in

471

unimpaired walking. The calculated speed for participants post-stroke was slower than their maximum over-ground

472

speed. At faster speeds, asymmetry could have had a larger effect on metabolic rate. However, many participants

473

with chronic stroke were unable to sustain altered step length asymmetry at faster speeds.

474

The biofeedback task might have been mentally challenging for individuals with chronic stroke, leading to

475

mental fatigue or loss in motivation. We wanted participants to voluntarily alter their step length asymmetry rather

476

than mechanically manipulate participants’ asymmetry using the split-belt treadmill, since voluntary modulation

477

provided a better test of our hypothesis. When we noticed participants were frequently missing targets, we provided

478

verbal encouragement to help maintain motivation. The challenge of voluntarily modulating step lengths could have

479

increased variability in step length asymmetry and metabolic rate, thus reducing statistical power. Because we only

480

altered step length asymmetry in this study, we were unable to determine if a relationship exists between metabolic

481

energy consumption and other types of asymmetry, such as temporal, kinetic, or kinematic.

Conclusions

484

We provided biofeedback to participants to encourage them to voluntarily alter step length asymmetry, and we

485

measured their metabolic rate during each condition. We confirmed that unimpaired individuals self-select a near

486

symmetric step length asymmetry that minimizes metabolic cost. When unimpaired participants walked more

487

asymmetrically, their energy consumption increased. This is consistent with findings for many other parameters in

488

unimpaired gait. Minimizing energy cost seems to influence walking behavior in unimpaired individuals.

489

In this study, participants with chronic stroke were able to voluntarily alter their step length asymmetry. We

490

found that individuals with chronic stroke have a strong preference for their self-selected step length asymmetry, but

491

we could not explain this preference with energy cost minimization. Additional insights into how participants altered

492

their step length asymmetry could be gained from looking at changes in joint kinematics and muscle activity. To

493

better understand why individuals with chronic stroke walk with their self-selected step length asymmetry, future

494

studies should be conducted to examine other potential influences, such as balance enhancement or fatigue

495

avoidance.

496

While minimizing energy use did not explain self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with

chronic stroke, altering metabolic energy consumption could still be a useful tool for rehabilitation. Our results

498

suggest that because metabolic cost does not increase with altered asymmetry, metabolic energy consumption

499

probably will not be a barrier to therapies involving practicing improved step length symmetry post-stroke. In fact,

500

manipulating the energy landscape(19) to encourage symmetric step length asymmetries could be more easily

501

accomplished. Rehabilitation methods that use changes in metabolic energy consumption to either incentivize a

502

desirable step length asymmetry or penalize an undesirable step length asymmetry might encourage individuals with

503

chronic stroke to self-select a more symmetric gait and improve long-term rehabilitation outcomes.
