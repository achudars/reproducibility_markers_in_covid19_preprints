Abstract
The Internet has become a prime source of health information available to the public.
Our aims were to assess the content and quality of online information for the
treatment of depression.
We searched, “How to cure depression” on Google and analysed the first 200
websites according to the website typology and a standard health information
assessment tool, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) criteria
(presence of authorship, date, disclosure, and references). We also analyzed
content in terms of treatments mentioned and developed a Quality Indicator Score
(QIS) based on the guidelines for treating depression from the UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
News websites were the most frequent typology followed by health portals, nonprofit, professional and government; commercial websites were the least
represented. In the top ten websites, news and health portals remained first and
second respectively. Antidepressants were the most mentioned treatment, followed
by psychotherapy, lifestyle & exercise, social support, diet. The least mentioned
interventions were sunlight & light therapy, routine, and ketamine & psychedelics.
Commercial websites preferentially mentioned supplements, while ketamine and
psychedelic drugs were the most covered by news outlets. Analysing webpages
according to our QIS showed the median of NICE recommended treatments was 2.5
out of 5 possible treatments: antidepressants, lifestyle & exercise, psychotherapy,
social support and ECT. Government websites had the highest QIS, news and
commercial websites the lowest. Webpages with high QIS ranked higher in Google.

Keywords: cure, depression, google, health information, internet, intervention,
online information, treatment.

Introduction
Depression is the leading cause of ill-health and disability worldwide and a major
contributor to the overall global burden of disease. It affects about three million
people in the UK, yet it has been estimated that only about one-third of these will
receive treatment [1].Barriers, such as social stigma [2, 3] and delayed access to
health care, result in a higher percentage usage of the Internet by patients with
depression, as it is an anonymous and instant source of widely available information.
For instance, a study revealed as many as 79% of young adults with mental health
challenges seek information about their conditions online [4]. With such websites
being searched for, often by vulnerable individuals, the content and quality of such
online health information gleaned is of great import, in terms of its reliability,
accuracy, completeness, safety, bias and validity [5].
This study aims to analyse the content and quality of information available online for
treatment of depression which would be found by the public when searching the
Internet. To do so we have applied a workflow that we have used previously for other
search topics, analyzing the first 200 websites returned by Google® upon searching
“how to cure depression”. To evaluate the health information quality (HIQ) of the
pages returned, we used the JAMA criteria as a standard assessment tool for their
trustworthiness [6]. The JAMA score is based on the presence of four intrinsic criteria
of a webpage (authorship, date, references and ownership of the website) and does
not take into account the scientific validity of the content. As a proxy indicator of
scientific correctness, we looked at the content of each website to identify types of
treatments and interventions described. We then assessed whether the information
was evidence-based using the guidelines of the UK National Institute of Clinical
Excellence (NICE) as a reference [7, 8].

Methods
Data collection
We searched the phrase, “How to cure depression” in Google.com from Brighton,
UK, using the Google Chrome browser in September 2018. Prior to beginning the
search, we cleared all browsing, caches and cookie histories to minimize
personalization of the results. The first 200 results returned on the SERP were saved

on a spreadsheet. We chose the sample size of 200 as this has previously been
suitable for identifying composition differences in the SERP [9, 10].
The workflow of the analysis is reported in Figure 1. Of the 200 websites returned by
Google, 26 were excluded. Exclusion criteria were: links not working (n=3), links with
no content (n=1), pages requiring subscription or payment (n=3), audio or video
(n=11), books (n=7); typically dynamic pages generated by amazon.com), pages
about veterinary medicine (n=1). Thus, 174 webpages were included in the analysis.

Website classification
Websites were then visited and classified to one of the following typologies:
commercial (C), government (G), health Portal (HP), news (N), non-Profit (NP) or
professional (P). Those not fitting into any typology were classified as others (O).
Examples of this classification are provided in Supplementary Table 1. The
classification was done by two independent researchers and disagreements were
resolved with discussion. The agreement was 93% and its strength is considered
very good (inter-rater agreement was: Kappa=0.907; confidence interval from 0.857
to 0.958).
Content analysis
The content was then analyzed and the type of intervention or treatment mentioned
was recorded; webpages often mentioned more than one treatment or intervention.
The list of intervention was compiled while going along with the analysis.
Health information quality indicators
The JAMA score was calculated for each webpage as described [6]. Briefly, we
noted whether the page contained the following: 1) author; 2) date of writing or
update; 3) external references; and 4) owner of the website. Each of these scored
“1” if the information was present on the page or within three clicks from the page,
according to the three-click rule [11]. Therefore, the JAMA score ranges from 0 to 4.
We also searched for the presence of the Health on the Net (HON) code, a quality
seal obtained by the HON foundation and takes into account various criteria of
transparency and trustworthiness [12].

Statistical analysis
When two frequencies were compared, a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used.
When comparing frequencies in more than two groups, P values were corrected for
multiple comparison using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to acquire a false
discovery rate of 0.25.
The JAMA score and any other quality score in two groups were compared using a
two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Multiple comparisons used a Kruskal-Wallis test
followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test.
When quantifying the agreement in assigning website typology, inter-rater
agreement between two raters was quantified as Cohen’s kappa based in Fleiss’
equations [13].
All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 for Windows (GraphPad
Software, Sand Diego, CA, USA). Inter-rater agreement was calculated using
GraphPad QuickCalc.

Results

Type of websites returned
Websites from news outlets were the most frequent, followed by health portals, and
the trend was similar for the whole search and in the top 10 websites (Figure 2).
Health Information Quality Indicators
The median JAMA score of the 174 websites analyzed was 3, IQR: [2, 3]. Figure 3
shows the frequency distribution (A) and analysis of the JAMA score across different
typologies (B). Of all websites, 119 (68%) had a JAMA score ≥ 3, which is
considered good [13]. The JAMA score varied across typologies with health portals
showing the highest values while commercial and government pages had the lowest.
The value for health portals was significantly higher when compared with
commercial, government, news or no profit. There was no significant difference in

the JAMA score of the top ten webpages and those ranked 11-200 by Google (top
10, median 3, IQR [2,4]; all other webpages, median 3, IQR [0,3].
When looking at the percentage of webpages that provided external references as
evidence for the information provided, one of the JAMA criteria, the condition was
met by 64 websites (37% of total). However, as shown in Figure 3C, there was a
huge difference across typologies, ranging from 10% in news webpages to 55% in
professional websites and 76% in health portals.
The HONcode seal was displayed by 56 or 174 webpages (32%). As shown in
Figure 3D, only health portals, news and professional websites displayed a
HONcode. When the percentage in each typology was compared with the remaining
websites (not with the total search to avoid comparing overlapping data), health
portals had a significantly higher frequency of HONcode certification while news, no
profit and other websites had a significantly lower one.
There was no significant difference in the presence of HONcode in the top ten
webpages and that in those ranked 11-200 by Google (not shown)

Content analysis: interventions
Figure 4 shows the interventions described and their frequency in the total search
(174 webpages) and in the top ten pages returned by Google. Antidepressants,
psychotherapy and lifestyle & exercise were the most mentioned treatments. The
least mentioned interventions were sunlight & light therapy, routine, and ketamine &
psychedelics. However, in the top ten webpages, psychotherapy and diet were the
most frequently mentioned treatment mentioned (Figure 4, orange bars).
As “completeness” may be considered a criterion of information quality [5, 14] we
analyzed the number of interventions described by webpages. The median number
of interventions mentioned by webpages was 4, IQR [2,7], with a minimum of 0 and a
maximum of 13. Interestingly, webpages with more complete information seems to
rank better. The number of interventions mentioned in the top ten webpages
(median, 6, min, 2, max, 9, IQR, 5.75-8.25, n=10) was significantly higher compared
to the remaining websites (median, 4, min, 0, max, 13, IQR, 2-7, n=164. P<0.05 by a
two-tailed Mann-Whitney’s test). Figure 5 shows how many indications were

mentioned in each typology of websites. Government and no-profit organizations’
websites had the highest median while health portals and news had the lowest. In a
multiple comparison, the value for news was significantly lower compared to
government and health portals.
Finally, we investigated whether certain website typologies were more inclined to
discuss certain treatment types while mentioning others less. The frequency of
interventions mentioned across the different website typologies is shown in Figure 7,
along with the expected frequency, observed in the total search. Noticeably,
commercial websites had a positive bias towards supplements. Ketamine and
psychedelic drugs were preferentially mentioned by news websites (of the 13
webpages mentioning it, 10 were from news websites).

A quality indicator score (QIS) based on evidence-based medicine
The proposed QIS looks at whether a webpage mentions interventions for
depression that are evidence-based as a proxy for “scientific correctness” of the
information. We have used the NICE guidelines on treating depression [7, 8]. These
include five types of intervention: antidepressants, lifestyle/exercise, psychotherapy,
social support and ECT. A webpage was then scored from 0 to 5 depending on how
many of these treatments were mentioned. The QIS of all webpages ranged from 0
to 4, with a median of 2, IQR [1,3]. As shown in Figure 6A, over 40% of the
webpages mentioned one or less evidence-based intervention. There was no
difference between the top 10 webpages and the rest of the SERP (not shown).
As seen in Figure 6B, government websites displayed the highest median QIS, and
news websites the lowest. Multiple comparison of all the website typologies against
each other showed that the differences between QIS for news vs government and
news vs non-profit were statistically significant. Since news websites were the
largest represented typology overall and in the top ten websites, we compared the
QIS of news (median, 2, min, 0, max, 5, IQR, 1-3, n=62) with that of the remaining
webpages (median, 3, min, 0, max, 5, IQR, 1.25-4, n=112) and the difference was
statistically significant (P<0.001 by a two-tailed Mann-Whitney’s test).

Discussion
Our study, which analysed 174 websites, provides a current and comprehensive
picture of the quality and content of health information accessible online about
treatments for depression. We also performed a sub-analysis of the top ten websites
to determine whether there were any significant differences in the visibility of
information obtained by users. The observation that news was the largest typology of
websites (35% of the whole SERP and 50% of the top ten) indicates the
newsworthiness of this topic. Our results confirms a previous study which found a
substantial increase in newspapers coverage on mental health between 2008 and
2014 in England [15]. More critically, research has shown news is a primary and
influential source of information for sufferers with depression and other mental
illnesses [16, 17]. A study conducted by MIND concluded that news coverage has a
direct impact on people suffering from mental illness disorders with 50% of sufferers
stating that media coverage had a negative impact on their own mental health and
34% feeling more depressed as a result [18].
A possible reason for the high percentage of news websites observed in this study
may paradoxically be an indication of the increased drive by the government to
remove the stigma associated with depression and promote a better public
awareness and understanding of mental health issues [19]. Such campaigns have all
impacted on the increased news publicity of depression and other mental health
issues [15].
Our HIQ analysis study found that although news had a high median JAMA score of
3 out of 4, the commonly missing JAMA criterion was “referencing”, which was
present in just 10% of news, indicating a lack of evidence-based information. This is
confirmed by the fact that new websites scored the lowest QIS. We observed, as
previous studies have concluded, that content tended to focus on a single news
worthy topic [20, 21], rather than providing well-rounded information about
depression or its available treatments [22]. Where treatments were mentioned, there
was a bias towards over-mentioning of ketamine & psychedelics and undermentioning of standard treatments like psychotherapy or social support, which are
potentially not as newsworthy as the use of ketamine as a “wonder drug”.

Health portals ranked second largest (nearly 30%) of website typologies. In
accordance with previous papers [23], our analysis found that health portal websites
had the majority of HONcode certifications. Although one limitation with HONcode
certification is that accuracy is not measured, studies have found certified
educational material is more accurate [24]. Health portals also scored the highest
median JAMA score of 4 and QIS score of 3, confirming they had a higher than
average quality of information and thus good evidence-based health information
coverage.
We have attempted to develop an evidence-based scoring system allowing a more
accurate review and analysis of the quality of health information content provided by
websites. It is based on a gold standard set of treatments and interventions which we
used as a comparison against treatments mentioned by websites. However, one
limitation is that ECT, one of the five treatments in the NICE care pathway, is not
mentioned very often as it is a specialist extreme case.
Our study found commercial websites made up only three out of 174 websites and
was not represented at all in the top ten. This is in line with other studies on breast
cancer treatment and influenza prevention where commercial websites were similarly
ranked low [23, 25]. This could, however, be due to the fact that companies selling
nutritional supplements and various alternative medicine products do not promote
these for the treatment of depression. Due to the extremely low number of
commercial websites, the results are effectively insignificant and could potentially be
ignored as impacting on sufferers.
A limitation of our study is that of search results change with time, search history and
location. Additionally, although clearing all cookies and browsing histories prior to
our study to avoid search biases, our geographical location was based on using
google.com and so the SERP would not have displayed websites in other languages.
We performed a sub-analysis of the top ten websites on the assumption that users
are unlikely to open more than the first ten websites returned on the SERP [26] , but
it is also recognised from studies using eye-tracking devices that another limitation is
that users may not necessarily open websites in visibility order but instead randomly
[27, 28].

Another limitation is that information quality depends not only on the purpose for
which information was provided, but also on how it is used [29]. QIS and
completeness are valid only for patient-oriented webpages and generic searches as the search term was “how to cure depression”. Obviously, if the search string was
specifically referring to a treatment (such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors) it would be
expected to have webpages only mentioning that treatment.

Figure 4. Interventions mentioned. Data show the percentage of interventions
mentioned in the top ten (orange, n = 10) and overall (blue, n = 174). As most
websites mentioned more than one treatment or intervention, the total percentages
add up to more than 100%.

Figure 7. Mention of different types of intervention across typologies of websites.
Data are expressed as a percentage of the total number of websites mentioning a
type of intervention. Data labels indicate the percentage of websites in a typology
that mention a specific intervention. Red and blue indicate an intervention that is
significantly over- or under-represented, respectively, in a typology compared with
the expected frequency (in the overall SERP). Statistical significance (P<0.05) was
calculated comparing the observed frequency and the expected one by Fisher’s test.
This was followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons with a
false discovery rate of 0.25.
