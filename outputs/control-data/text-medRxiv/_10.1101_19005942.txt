Abstract
Introduction: From June 2014-October 2015, the Michigan Department of Health and
Human Services (MDHHS) reported a Legionnaires' disease (LD) outbreak in Genesee
County, Michigan, of which Flint is the county seat. MDHHS' final case count for the
outbreak was 90 cases, including 10 deaths among Genesee County residents. As LD
is not routinely tested for as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia, the size of the
outbreak may have been underestimated. Specifically, some LD cases may have been
classified as pneumonias of other or unexplained etiologies.
Objective: To estimate excess pneumonia deaths in Genesee County during the 201415 LD outbreak and compare this with reported deaths due to LD.
Methods: We used data from the CDC WONDER database, which contains monthly
county-level counts of death certificates, on all pneumonia deaths among residents of
Genesee and a set of similar counties from 2011-2017. We calculated excess
pneumonia deaths in Genesee during the period of the LD outbreak (May 2014-October
2015). We used data from the Genesee County Vital Records Division to map
pneumonia deaths by census tract to assess geographic overlap with reported LD
cases.
Results: We estimated 70.0 excess pneumonia deaths (90% uncertainty interval (UI):
36 to 103) in Genesee County during the LD outbreak. This is substantially higher than
the 10 LD deaths among Genesee County residents reported by MDHHS. Areas of high
pneumonia mortality overlapped with those with high LD incidence and were primarily
located in western Flint and northwestern non-Flint Genesee County.
Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the LD outbreak
was larger than reported. Earlier detection and response to this outbreak may have
facilitated identification of these additional cases.

Introduction
Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the
leading cause of disease outbreaks due to drinking water in the United States.1,2
Infection with Legionella can lead to Legionnaires’ disease (LD), a severe form
pneumonia.3,4 Many cases can be successfully treated with antibiotics, but LD is fatal in
approximately 10% of cases.4
From June 2014-October 2015, the Michigan Department of Health and Human
Services (MDHHS) reported a LD outbreak in Genesee County, Michigan, of which Flint
is the county seat. Officially, the outbreak consisted of 90 confirmed LD cases, including
12 deaths (10 of whom were Genesee county residents).5 According to the National
Outbreak Reporting System maintained by the Centers for Disease Prevention and
Control and Prevention (CDC), the median size of LD outbreaks in the U.S. from 20092017 was 3 cases (IQR: 2–5) and 0 deaths (IQR: 0–1), making this the fourth-largest
known LD outbreak since 2009.6
The timing of this outbreak coincided with the water crisis in the City of Flint that began
in late April 2014, when treated water from Lake Huron supplied by the Detroit Water
and Sewerage Department was replaced with locally-treated water from the Flint River.7
This change resulted in widespread effects on water quality primarily in Flint but also in
greater Genesee County.7,8 One such effect of the switch was a reduction in the level of
free chlorine present in the municipal water supply, a change which can be conducive to
growth and persistence of L. pneumophila.7,8 Such alterations may have been linked to
the LD outbreak, though its etiology remains unresolved.7
Despite a five-fold increase in LD incidence since 2000 and approximately 7,000 cases
reported in 2017, LD is generally considered to be underdiagnosed.5,9-11 Indeed, a
recent report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
(NASEM) estimated there may be 52,000-70,000 total LD cases per year.11
The CDC has recommended LD testing for specific groups, including individuals with
pneumonia requiring ICU care or who failed initial antibiotic treatment, with recent travel
histories, who are immunocompromised, or who are residents in a healthcare facility
where a specific Legionella exposure risk has been identified.4 Even among these
groups physicians may not routinely test for Legionella as a cause of pneumonia, in part
because LD often responds to broad-spectrum antibiotics.4 For community-acquired
pneumonias, physicians are generally encouraged to test for LD only when made aware
of an outbreak.9 Indeed, the number of urine antigen tests for LD diagnosis conducted
by Genesee County hospitals increased 45% from 2015 to 201612 after the medical
community was notified of the ongoing LD outbreak in Genesee County.
Because increased clinical testing for LD has often been contingent upon awareness of
outbreaks, prompt communication from public health officials to local healthcare
providers is critical for outbreak-associated case identification. Although the first official
outbreak-associated LD cases in Genesee County were admitted to the hospital in June
2014, infection control personnel at local hospitals were not officially notified of an
elevated risk of LD until February 2015, and the outbreak was not acknowledged

publicly until January 2016.13 This timeline suggests the potential for outbreakassociated LD cases to have been misdiagnosed or missed entirely.
To determine whether additional LD cases may have gone unidentified during the 201415 Genesee outbreak, we used data on pneumonia deaths from 2011-2017 in Genesee
and other comparable counties to 1) quantify whether and how many excess
pneumonia deaths occurred in Genesee County during the outbreak, and 2) compare
this number to the official LD death count reported. We also explored whether excess
pneumonia mortality and LD cases occurred in similar geographic areas.
Methods
Data Sources
Pneumonia Deaths
We extracted pneumonia deaths from two sources: the CDC WONDER Multiple Cause
of Death database and the Genesee County Vital Records Division (GCVRD).
From the CDC WONDER database we abstracted monthly counts of non-viral
pneumonia and LD deaths (hereafter referred to as “pneumonia deaths”) in Genesee
and control counties from 2011-2017.14 Because Genesee County is classified as a
“Medium Metro” county according to the National Center for Health Statistics 2013
Urbanization Classifications, we selected all other Medium Metro counties (n = 45) from
Michigan and four neighboring states (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin) as control
counties.15 Pneumonia deaths were identified using ICD-10 codes J15-J18 for non-viral
pneumonia and A48.1 and A48.2 for LD. In months with suppressed death counts for
Genesee County (fewer than 10 deaths per month due to either pneumonia or LD) in
WONDER, we assumed 8 such deaths during the month.
In addition to data from CDC WONDER, staff from the news program Frontline provided
the authors with a dataset they compiled on all pneumonia (including LD) deaths in
Genesee County from 2011-2017. This data was abstracted from death certificates
obtained from GCVRD and included residential census tract information on all deaths.
We used the WONDER data to estimate excess pneumonia mortality and the GCVRD
data to map pneumonia deaths since WONDER data does not include geolocation data
beyond the county level.
LD Cases
Frontline compiled a list of LD outbreak cases by aggregating data from several
sources: a list of 46 confirmed LD cases from Genesee County diagnosed between
June 2014 and March 2015 provided by MDHHS, as well as 31 additional cases
Frontline identified from legal documents and news reports. This list included 67 total
cases. Frontline provided the authors an anonymized version of this case list with the
residential census tract of each case. From this list, we excluded 9 cases who were
non-Genesee residents and 3 with an unknown hospitalization date. The remaining 55
cases were used in the mapping analysis.

Of note, MDHHS' final report listed 90 confirmed cases and 12 deaths, suggesting
Frontline’s list was missing 23 cases.2 The MDHHS report only included the cases’
months of symptom onset, however, and did not contain the geographic information
necessary for case mapping.2 Of the 12 deaths in the MDHHS report, 10 were Genesee
County residents.
Population Data
To calculate incidence and mortality rate denominators we gathered county- and census
tract-level population data from the Census and American Fact Finder for 2010-2017.
We assumed a simple linear population change between mid-year (July 1) estimates for
all counties.
Statistical Analysis
Excess Deaths Estimation
We used a Bayesian negative binomial model to model monthly counts of pneumonia
deaths in Genesee and control counties with an offset of the natural log of the county
population in a given month. Our data consisted of 84 monthly counts of pneumonia
deaths over 7 years in each of two geographical areas: Genesee County, and the
control counties described above (n = 168 total observations). The model included fixed
effects for Genesee vs. control counties, month, and flu season year (defined as
October-September) to control for secular trends in pneumonia incidence and influenza
season severity. Because Genesee pneumonia mortality was particularly elevated
during May-October 2014, we included a term indicating the outbreak stage: “early”
outbreak (May 2014- October 2014), “late” outbreak (November 2014-October 2015), or
not during the outbreak (all other months from 2011-2017). Although the first LD case
was not reported until early June 2014, we chose May 2014 as the start of the outbreak
in our main analysis to capture any deaths that may have occurred earlier. We also
included an interaction between the location and outbreak stage terms. The interaction
terms for early outbreak x Genesee and late outbreak x Genesee represent the
estimated difference in the differences in pneumonia mortality between Genesee and
control counties during versus outside the LD outbreak. In other words, they represent
an estimate of the change in pneumonia mortality in Genesee during the outbreak as
compared to non-outbreak periods.
We used weakly regularizing priors for the intercept [N(-10, 5)], fixed effect coefficients
[N(0, 1)], and the shape parameter [Gamma(0.01, 0.01)]. The model’s linear predictor
represents the natural log of the number of pneumonia deaths for each month and
location. We calculated predicted pneumonia mortality rates by exponentiating this
value and dividing by the population for that location and month to yield a predicted rate.
To estimate excess deaths we ran a second model, excluding the outbreak and
outbreak x Genesee terms, on the 150 observations unaffected by the LD outbreak (i.e.
all control county months as well as Genesee months outside the LD outbreak). We

sampled from this second model’s posterior predictive distribution to generate 4,000
counterfactual predictions for the expected number of deaths in Genesee each month
from May 2014-October 2015 absent the LD outbreak. For each posterior prediction we
took the difference between the prediction and the observed death count for that month,
summed these differences across the 18 months of the outbreak (May 2014-October
2015), and used the resulting distribution of summed differences to calculate a mean
and 90% uncertainty interval (UI) for excess deaths.
Mapping
To map the residential census tracts of LD cases and pneumonia deaths, we obtained
county and census tract shapefiles (2010 Census version) from the U.S. Census
Bureau. We calculated and mapped the LD incidence during the "early” outbreak period
(June 2014 – October 2014), and the entire duration of outbreak (June 2014 – October
2015) by census tract in Genesee County. We mapped pneumonia mortality by
residential census tract across those same time periods and two additional periods:
before the outbreak (January 2011 – May 2014) and after the outbreak (October 2015 –
December 2017). We compared areas of high LD incidence with those of high
pneumonia mortality during the outbreak, and also identified census tracts with the
largest changes in pneumonia mortality before as compared to during the LD outbreak.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results to several
key assumptions. First, we calculated excess deaths assuming that the outbreak began
in June (to mirror official reports), rather than May. Second, we considered an excess
deaths model with a fixed effect for calendar year 2017, because our data showed that
pneumonia deaths were elevated in Genesee relative to control counties during this
period for reasons that are unknown but likely unrelated to the 2014-15 LD outbreak.
Lastly, to allay concerns about small counts of LD cases and pneumonia deaths by
census tract, we also mapped LD and pneumonia mortality by pseudo-quadrants in Flint
and surrounding Genesee County rather than by census tract.
Data and Code Availability
All data, code, and output for our models, maps, and sensitivity analyses is available on
Github.
All analyses were done in R v.3.5.1; the models were fit using the brms package and
mapping was performed using the sp package.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Emory
University.

Results
Using the CDC WONDER database, we identified 1,461 pneumonia deaths among
Genesee County residents and 24,692 pneumonia deaths among residents across 45
control counties from 2011-2017. Deaths specifically coded with LD as a cause of death
represented less than 0.2% of total pneumonia deaths. A complete list of control
counties located in Michigan and surrounding states of Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and
Wisconsin is available (Supplemental Table 1).
The GCVRD data included 1,761 pneumonia deaths among Genesee County residents
from 2011-2017, 1,751 of whom had residential census tract information. While the
GCVRD data contained 348 more pneumonia deaths than were identified via
WONDER, the GCVRD and WONDER data showed similar seasonal and secular
trends.
Pneumonia Mortality Visualization
Monthly pneumonia mortality rates from 2011-2017 showed an increase in pneumonia
mortality beginning in May 2014 in Genesee as compared to control counties,
coincident with the start of outbreak-associated LD cases (Figure 1).

Excess Deaths Estimation
Fit and convergence diagnostics, including R-hat measures, trace plots, and posterior
predictive checks suggested the Bayesian negative binomial models converged and fit
well (see the GitHub page).
The pneumonia mortality rate was 6% lower in Genesee County than control counties
during months before and after the LD outbreak (rate ratio (RR) 0.94, 90% UI: 0.880.99). During the LD outbreak, Genesee County pneumonia mortality was 31% (RR
1.31, 90% UI: 1.10-1.54) and 13% (RR 1.13, 90% UI: 0.96-1.32) higher in the
outbreak’s early and late periods, respectively, as compared to control counties (Table
1).
Controlling for monthly and yearly incidence trends, pneumonia mortality increased 38%
(RR 1.38, 90% UI: 1.16-1.66) and 18% (RR 1.18, 90% UI: 1.03-1.36) in Genesee
County during the LD outbreak relative to the periods before and after the outbreak.
Of note, the estimated pneumonia mortality rate is lower in Genesee County prior to and
after the outbreak but substantially elevated during the outbreak, particularly during the
early outbreak period from May–October 2014. (Figure 2).

Mapping
Areas with high LD incidence were concentrated in western Flint and in northwestern,
non-Flint Genesee County. (Figure 4) These same areas had the highest increases in
pneumonia mortality during the time period of the LD outbreak relative to before the
outbreak. (Figure 5)

with white borders are located in the city of Flint. Each tract is colored based on the
change in pneumonia mortality rate (cases per 1000) during as compared to before
(January 2011 – April 2014) the outbreak. Positive values indicate higher mortality
during the LD outbreak than before the outbreak; census tracts with the most positive
values are shown in increasingly lighter shades of orange and yellow.
Sensitivity Analyses
None of the sensitivity analyses we conducted substantively affected our conclusions.
Considering June, rather than May, as the beginning of the outbreak reduced our
excess deaths estimate to 64.7 (90% UI: 32-96) (see Github). Including a separate
fixed effect for calendar year 2017 and an interaction with Genesee increased our
estimate of the excess pneumonia deaths from 70.0 to 80.4 (90% UI: 47-112) (see
Github). This model also provides a better fit, particularly for pneumonia mortality in
2017 in Genesee. Assuming 5 deaths instead of 8 for months with suppressed counts in
WONDER did not change the estimate substantively. Lastly, pseudo-quadrant maps did
id
not show meaningfully different trends from those showing census tract-level data (see
Github).
Discussion
We estimated 70.0 excess pneumonia deaths (90% UI: 36-103) in Genesee County
during the LD outbreak. This is substantially higher than the 10 LD deaths among
Genesee County residents reported by local public health officials. Areas with high
pneumonia mortality overlapped those with high LD mortality, particularly in western
Flint and northwestern non-Flint Genesee County. Taken together, this evidence

suggests that the excess deaths we estimated may be partially attributable to
unidentified LD.
Our results are consistent with other recent LD analyses attempting to estimate the true
burden of the disease. A recent analysis from Connecticut estimates that only 10.6% of
hospitalized LD cases are diagnosed – suggesting the total hospitalized cases could be
9.4 times reported totals.16 The 2019 NASEM report estimates the total LD burden to be
upwards of 50,000 cases annually, implying that the actual number of LD cases in the
U.S. could be 7-10 times higher than official reports.11
Identifying every case in an outbreak is often impossible given the practical limitations of
outbreak investigation and the challenges of retrospective case identification. As such, it
is not surprising that some outbreak-associated LD cases would go undetected.
However, prompt communication with local communities and healthcare professionals –
such as via a Health Alert Network (HAN) or another platform for rapid and broad
distribution of public health information – is a key component of an LD outbreak
response.17 This communication raises awareness among physicians of the potential for
Legionella exposure and may encourage them to test for LD as a cause of pneumonia.
Notifying the community of an LD outbreak also alerts the public to their own risk of
exposure, allowing additional cases to seek care and be diagnosed. Compared to other
recent outbreaks of community-acquired LD, information regarding this outbreak was
communicated to stakeholders relatively late: although the first cases were diagnosed in
June 2014, local infection control personnel were not officially notified for another 8
months (February 2015), and the public was not notified for another 19 months (January
2016), after the outbreak had ended.13 This timeline stands in stark contrast to, for
example, a large LD outbreak that occurred in the South Bronx in New York City in
2015.17 In this outbreak, clinicians at local hospitals were notified by the health
department within a week of the detection of a cluster of LD cases. Physicians were
encouraged to test for Legionella in patients with suggestive respiratory symptoms and
request that autopsies be performed on patients with unexplained respiratory illness.
The general public was notified within weeks of the first cases and community
engagement activities were coordinated to allay community concerns about the
outbreak and to identify additional cases. As a result of these efforts, the South Bronx
outbreak was declared over in August 2015 – less than two months after it had started.
It is important to note that publicizing information regarding a cluster of LD cases,
especially in its early stages, is a sensitive decision that carries risks as well as benefits.
No two outbreaks are exactly the same, and public health officials must rely on their
experience and their assessment of the specific contours of the situation in order to
decide when and how much information to release to the public. Moreover, in this
particular case, local public health officials were simultaneously devoting resources to
addressing other health effects of the water crisis. Even so, it remains difficult to
reconcile the severe delays in communication that occurred in response to the 2014-15
LD outbreak in Genesee County. It is possible that these delays prevented identification
of additional cases and deaths that may have facilitated earlier resolution of the
outbreak.
Our analysis has several limitations. First, it is unlikely that all 70 excess pneumonia
deaths we identified were due to LD. Some deaths may have been due to other causes

of pneumonia, though we excluded viral pneumonias to mitigate this risk. Perhaps less
likely, some individuals who died of LD may not have had pneumonia listed as a cause
on their death certificate; these cases would not have been included in our analysis.
Second, our analysis is limited to estimating outbreak-associated LD deaths; it did not
allow us to draw direct conclusions about the total number of non-lethal LD cases. That
said, it is reasonable to assume the fraction of unidentified LD cases may be similar to
or larger than that for unidentified deaths, assuming that fatal cases were more likely to
have been identified.
Third, our model rests on the assumption that the control counties we selected are
similar to Genesee with respect to any factors that might influence risk of pneumonia
and LD – that is, they represent what would have happened in Genesee absent the LD
outbreak. In addition to choosing counties that had a similar urbanicity to Genesee, we
chose counties from the surrounding region to control for climate-related factors
associated with pneumonia acquisition, including the impact of geography on influenza
seasonality and spread. Of note, differences in age, race, and other sociodemographic
features between Genesee and control counties should not bias our results unless
these differences changed over the course of our study (2011-2017); we consider this
implausible. Furthermore, the trends in mortality in the two groups before the outbreak,
while unstable due to relatively small numbers of pneumonia deaths in Genesee, were
not obviously different.
Finally, we used the Multiple Cause of Death database from WONDER to identify
pneumonia deaths in Genesee County, which includes the underlying cause of death in
addition to any other causes of death listed on the death certificate by the physician.
Although this may have captured some individuals for whom pneumonia, and
unidentified LD, was not their primary cause of death, we chose this approach to ensure
an inclusive case definition. Moreover, because mortality from LD is greater among
individuals with pre-existing health conditions than among healthy persons1, it is
especially likely that LD cases would have had a non-pneumonia underlying cause of
death listed.
Prompt and thorough response to outbreaks of LD is important beyond Genesee
County. LD incidence has increased dramatically in the U.S. since 2001, which may
reflect the changing epidemiology of LD.1 Both the increased prevalence of LD risk
factors (old age, immunosuppression) and a higher proportion of the population living in
cities with aging and centralized water systems may be among key factors increasing
LD risk. As these risk factors become increasingly common, implementing routine
testing of patients hospitalized with pneumonia for LD can help to rapidly identify and
investigate LD outbreaks as well as provide critical data for further understanding the
epidemiology of this disease.11 This information can ultimately inform regulatory policies
aimed at protecting the public against Legionella in water systems, such as those
implemented by New York City in response to the South Bronx outbreak.11,18 These
policies should be informed by a strong evidence base of research into both individuallevel risk factors for severe disease as well as the environmental and infrastructural
conditions that put populations at high risk.

In summary, we found approximately 70 excess pneumonia deaths during the 20142015 outbreak of LD in Genesee County, Michigan. These deaths were located in
similar geographic areas to reported LD cases. Given that there were only 10 reported
LD deaths among Genesee County residents, our findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that there were additional unidentified LD deaths and cases during this time
period. Though all reported cases were investigated by public health officials, delays in
communication may have resulted in a failure to identify others. Prompt and complete
identification of cases can inform epidemiologic investigations aiming to identify
common exposures as well as provide critical information about environmental and
structural risk factors for LD.
