Abstract

21

Renal cell carcinoma comprises a variety of entities, the most common being the clear-cell,

22

papillary and chromophobe subtypes. These subtypes are related to different clinical

23

evolution; however, most therapies have been developed for clear-cell carcinoma and there is

24

not a specific treatment based on different subtypes. In this study, one hundred and sixty-four

25

paraffin samples from primary nephrectomies for localized tumors were analyzed. MiRNAs

26

were isolated and measured by microRNA arrays. Significance Analysis of Microarrays and

27

Consensus Cluster algorithm were used to characterize different renal subtypes. The analyses

28

showed that chromophobe renal tumors are a homogeneous group characterized by an

29

overexpression of miR 1229, miR 10a, miR 182, miR 1208, miR 222, miR 221, miR 891b, miR

30

629-5p and miR 221-5p. On the other hand, clear cell renal carcinomas presented two

31

different groups inside this histological subtype, with differences in miRNAs that regulate focal

32

adhesion, transcription, apoptosis and angiogenesis processes. Specifically, one of the defined

33

groups had an overexpression of proangiogenic microRNAs miR185, miR126 and miR130a. In

34

conclusion, differences in miRNA expression profiles between histological renal subtypes were

35

established. In addition, clear cell renal carcinomas had different expression of proangiogenic

36

miRNAs. With the emergence of antiangiogenic drugs, these differences could be used as

37

therapeutic targets in the future or as a selection method for tailoring personalized

38

treatments.

Introduction

40

Renal carcinoma (RC) is the sixth most common cancer in men and the eight in women, with

41

73,820 estimated new cases and 14,770 estimated deaths in the United States in 2019 [1].

42

Two thirds of patients have localized disease and an additional 16% have locoregional disease

43

(stage III) at diagnosis. A significant proportion of all these patients (up to 40% in stage III) will

44

eventually relapse [2, 3].

45

Antiangiogenic multi-kinase inhibitors have demonstrated significant efficacy in the metastatic

46

setting, but have not fulfilled expectations in the adjuvant setting. Sorafenib (SORCE trial),

47

pazopanib (PROTECT trial) and axitinib (ATLAS trial) failed to improve disease-free survival

48

when compared with placebo, whereas sunitinib improved disease-free survival but did not

49

impact in overall survival (STRAC trial) [4-7]. As a consequence, sunitinib has been approved

50

for adjuvant therapy by the Food and Drug Administration, but not by the European Medicines

51

Agency and observation remains the standard of care after resection.

52

The current classical classification of renal carcinoma refers to subtypes that have been named

53

on the basis of predominant cytoplasmic or architectural features, anatomic location,

54

correlation with a specific disease background, as well as molecular alterations or familial

55

syndromes [8]. The Cancer Genome Atlas has made considerable efforts to molecularly

56

characterized different neoplasms, amongst them, renal carcinoma, establishing molecular

57

characteristics of the different histological renal subtypes [9, 10]. So far, this information has

58

not contributed to improve the personalized treatment for patients with renal cell carcinoma.

59

Molecular markers different from gene expression could improve our understanding of this

60

disease. MicroRNAs are small RNA sequences which regulate different cellular processes [11].

61

They are good molecular biomarkers or even therapeutic targets, especially in clinical paraffin

62

samples [12]. For these reasons, miRNAs have acquired importance as biomarkers in cancer.

The aim of this study is to determine miRNA profiles which allow us to characterize RC

64

subtypes. Interestingly, we identified two groups of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors,

65

one of them with an overexpression of pro-angiogenic microRNAs.

Material and methods

67

Samples

68

One hundred and sixty-four patients diagnosed with localized RC were recruited for this study.

69

An observational study was carried out, where all radical and partial nephrectomies performed

70

at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid between 1999 and 2008 were included.

71

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The protocol was approved by the

72

Ethical Committee of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre. The evolution of these patients was

73

obtained from clinical records.

74

miRNA isolation and quantification

75

396 miRNAs were measured from 164 renal formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor

76

samples. microRNA extraction and sample processing were done as previously described [13].

77

Briefly, selected FFPE tumor specimens were cut into serial sections with a thickness of 10 µm.

78

Total RNA was then isolated using the miRNEasy Kit (Quiagen). Purified RNA quality control for

79

quantity and purity was assessed using an ND-1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo

80

Fisher Scientific).

81

MicroRNA Arrays

82

Samples were hybridized to Human miRNA Microarray Release 14.0, 8x15K (Agilent

83

Technologies). MicroRNA Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies) was used to label RNA. Basically,

84

100 ng of total RNA were dephosphorylated and Cyanine 3-pCp molecule was ligated to the 3´

85

end of each RNA molecule by using T4 RNA ligase. One hundred ng of Cy3 labeled RNA were

86

hybridized for 20 hours at 55ºC in a hybridization oven (G2545A, Agilent) set to 20 rpm in a

87

final concentration of 1X GE Blocking Agent and 1X Hi-RPM Hybridization Buffer, according to

88

manufacturer's instructions (miRNA Microarray System Protocol, Agilent Technologies). Arrays

89

were washed according to manufacturer's instructions (miRNA Microarray System Protocol,

90

Agilent Technologies), dried out using a centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 2 min and scanned at 5µm

91

resolution on an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA, Agilent Technologies) equipped

92

with extended dynamic range (XDR) software. Images provided by the scanner were analyzed

93

using Agilent´s software Feature Extraction version 10.7.3.1. Data were quantile normalized as

94

previously described [14].

95

Only miRNAs with an average intensity over the 20th percentile of the overall intensities and a

96

detectable signal in at least 10 percent of the hybridized samples considered for further

97

analysis. Batch effect was corrected using ComBat software [15].

98

Consensus cluster

99

Consensus cluster using R v3.2.5 and

ConsensusClusterPlus

package was performed to

100

establish subgroups [16]. Differential miRNAs expression patterns among groups was analyzed

101

by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) with MeV 4.9 [17]. SAM performed a t-test

102

correcting over permutations of the number of samples [18].

103

Targets of these differential miRNAs were searched in miRwalk database [19]. This information

104

was used to perform a gene ontology analysis and to establish relationship with biological

105

functions. Gene ontology analyses were done using Enrichr webtool developed by Ma’ayan lab

106

[20].

Characterization of differences between histological subtypes

119

A SAM was done to characterize different miRNA expression patterns between histological

120

groups. It was not possible to find differential miRNAs between papillary and the two other

121

histological subtypes. SAM showed that chromophobe tumors are a very homogeneous

127

On the other hand, ccRCC tumors were split into two different groups in the SAM graph,

128

suggesting the existence of two molecular groups in ccRCC according the miRNA expression

129

(Fig 2).

131

ccRCC groups’ characterization

132

With the aim of establishing these possible subgroups in ccRCC, a consensus cluster was done.

133

Consensus cluster grouped patients by the similarity in their expression patterns and it allows

134

the definition of the optimum number of groups, showing that two different molecular patient

135

groups existed in ccRCC: ccRCC1 (44 patients) and ccRCC2 (56 patients) (Fig 3).

136

Fig 3: A. Delta graph suggested two groups as the optimum number of groups in these

137

subtype. B. Tracking plot showed different sample classifications making different number of

138

groups.

139

Contingency analyses showed that this new ccRCC classification was independent from clinical

140

data, such as tumor size or nodal status; i.e, there are no differences in tumor size or nodal

141

status betwween these two groups (p=0.55 and p=0.39 respectively). However, ccRCC2 tumors

142

had a lower Furhman grade than ccRCC1 tumors (p=0.04).

143

Moreover, a SAM established 136 differentially expressed miRNAs between these two groups

144

(Fig 4).

145

Fig 4: SAM between two ccRCC identified groups.

146

Experimentally validated targets of these 136 miRNAs were determined using miRwalk

147

database, and a gene ontology analysis of these genes was performed afterwards. This analysis

148

showed that these genes were mainly related with focal adhesion, transcription, apoptosis and

149

angiogenesis processes (Fig 5).

150

151

Additionally, the two subgroups of ccRCC were associated with a different survival, although

152

not statistically significant (Fig 6).

154

New ccRCC groups had differential expression of miRNAs involved in

155

angiogenesis

156

Interestingly, the two ccRCC subgroups presented differences in expression of some miRNAs

157

previously associated with angiogenesis. In general, ccRCC2 had more expression of miR185,

158

miR126 and miR130a, all of them proangiogenic miRNAs (Fig 7).

161

Discussion

162

Renal-cell carcinoma comprises several histological subgroups [8]. The Cancer Genome Atlas

163

analyzed these histological subtypes and characterized molecular differences between them

164

[9, 10]. However, all these advances have not been translated into clinical applications yet. For

165

this reason, further insight into the molecular biology of these tumors is still needed.

166

There are previous classifications of renal histological subtypes based on miRNA signatures,

167

although a reduce number of miRNAs were used in these analyses [21-23]. In this study, 396

168

miRNAs were analyzed in 164 RC FFPE samples by microRNA arrays. The main advantage of the

169

measurement of miRNAs is that they are more stable than longer RNAs or DNA in paraffin

170

samples [12].

171

SAM showed differences at the miRNA expression level in chromophobe and ccRCC, but no in

172

papillary tumors. The fact that it was not possible to define differential miRNAs in the papillary

173

subgroup could be due to the reduced number of this type of tumors in our cohort and the

174

intrinsic heterogeneity of this group.

175

miR10-a, miR222, and miR221 have been previously described as overexpressed in

176

chromophobe subtype, what agrees with our results [22, 23].

177

Regarding ccRCC tumors, differential expression pattern analysis suggested the existence of

178

two different groups inside this histological subtype. This was confirmed by Consensus Cluster,

179

which defined two groups with different expression in miRNAs whose established targets are

180

related to angiogenesis, apoptosis, transcription and focal adhesion.

181

Interestingly, three of the miRNAs (miR185, miR126, and miR130a) differentially expressed

182

between our two ccRCC groups have been previously related with pro-angiogenesis processes.

183

Expression levels of miR185 have been correlated with tumor size, Fuhrman grade, and TNM

184

staging. The overexpression of this miRNA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis [24].

185

Moreover, elevated miR185 levels were associated with high vascular endothelial growth

186

factor receptor 2 (VEGFR) expression and therefore a pro-angiogenic activity in ccRCC [25].

187

On the other hand, miR126 inhibits the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1

188

(VCAM1) implicated in leukocyte adherence to endothelial cells [26]. This miRNA has a pro-

189

angiogenic function [27]. It is downregulated in metastatic ccRCC versus primary tumors. Its

190

overexpression is negatively correlated with tumor size and is associated with longer distant

191

relapse-free survival and overall survival. miR126 overexpression is also related with a

192

reduction in cellular proliferation [28]. According to these facts, miR126 was underexpressed

193

in our ccRCC1 group which had a worst prognosis.

194

miR130a were identified as proangiogenic miRNA due to its inhibitory effect in the anti-

195

angiogenic homeobox GAX and HoxA5 [29]. A relationship between this miRNA and renal

196

carcinoma had not been previously described.

197

Considering the controversial efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs in the adjuvant setting of renal-

198

cell carcinoma [30], defining a proangiogenic group may be important to select patients more

199

likely to benefit from these treatments. In the future, a class predictor could be developed to

200

define this pro-angiogenic group. Such a predictor should be validated in an independent

201

cohort.

202

In this work, we have characterized differences between RC histological subtypes using

203

miRNAs and have defined two ccRCC groups with different expression of pro-angiogenic

204

miRNAs. Differences between subtypes could be used as therapeutic targets or as a method to

205

select patients for personalized treatments in the future.
