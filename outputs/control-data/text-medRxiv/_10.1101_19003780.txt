Cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are widely used to evaluate the opportunity cost of health
care investments. However, few functions that take equity concerns into account are available
for such CEA methods, and these concerns are therefore at risk of being disregarded. Among
the functions that have been developed, most focus on the distribution of health gains, as
opposed to the distribution of lifetime health. This is despite the fact that there are good
reasons to give higher priority to individuals and groups with a low health adjusted life
expectancy. Also, an even distribution of health gains may imply an uneven distribution of
lifetime health.

We develop a systematic and explicit approach that allows for the inclusion of lifetime health
concerns in CEAs, by creating a new priority weight function, PW=α+(t-γ)·C·e-β·(t-γ), where t
is the health measure. PW has several desirable properties. First, it is continuous and smooth,
ensuring that people with similar health characteristics are treated alike. Second, it is flexible
regarding shape and outcome measure, so that a broad range of values may be modelled.
Third, the coefficients have distinct roles. This allows for the easy manipulation of the PW’s
shape. In order to demonstrate how PW may be applied, we use data from a previous study
and estimated the coefficients of PW based on two approaches.

Prioritisation of limited health care resources involves saying no and yes, hard ethical
problems and reasonable disagreements. In health economics, cost-effectiveness analysis
(CEA) is used to identify the most efficient allocation of health care resources. Within such a
framework, informed decisions based on explicit CEA rankings can be made. However,
CEAs have been extensively criticised for not being sensitive to fair distribution of health
benefits, and there are other important equity concerns which may be considered, and few
standardised methods are available to directly adjust incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) [1-3]. CEAs are used to inform policy decisions on the introduction or
reimbursement of new technologies or pharmaceuticals in countries such as the UK, Norway,
Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia, in some cases including considerations
beyond CEA through concepts like severity or burden of disease [4-14].

Typical health metrics in CEAs are quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) averted [15]. These aggregate measures take into consideration
not only the life expectancy (LE) of a group, but also the quality of life. Interventions and
health programs are typically ranked by ICERs, where those that maximize QALYs gained or
DALYs averted are favoured. However, such rank-orders of interventions based on ICERs
have been criticized because they disregard concerns for those who are worst off [16]. There
are good reasons to give higher priority to individuals and groups with impaired health [16].
As opposed to health maximisation, one could aim for equal distribution of health across all
individuals in society. This would require that resources should always be directed at people
with the most impaired health, so as to minimize inequality in health outcomes, even if this
means that the total health in the population will be reduced. People’s intuition about what is
fair may lie somewhere between strict health maximisation and strict equality. A compromise
between these perspectives is that health maximization is an important goal, but health gains
to people with impaired health are assigned more weight than similar gains to people with
better initial health [17]. This “in between” position is called prioritarianism and has been
defended by the philosophers like Derek Parfit [18] and Matthew Adler [19]. According to
prioritarianism, a cheap and effective intervention directed at the healthiest may be preferred
to an expensive and ineffective intervention directed at those who have worse health if left
untreated. Still, if cost and effect were equal, the allocation of resources should be directed
towards people with more impaired health if left untreated. Finally, when comparing
competing health programs, studies have found that people favor priority to worse off, and
they favor interventions that benefit those that are worse off over slightly less cost-effective
interventions that benefit better off groups [20, 21]. Such equity concerns are too important to
leave out from standard CEAs.

One may also argue that non-health concerns, like age, indirect benefits, productivity, and
financial risk protection, are also important regarding equity. However, this paper focuses on
health related concerns. At the time of a prospective health intervention, concerns for health
distribution can be roughly divided into two perspectives: The first perspective is forward
looking and is only concerned with the distribution of the health gains, typically measured in
QALYs or DALYs. E.g., one may think that one QALY gained for 50 people is better, equal

or worse than 50 QALYs gained for one individual. The second perspective is dealing with
the distribution of health over a lifetime, typically measured as quality adjusted life
expectancy from birth (QALE) [22, 23]. E.g., consider two individuals who may benefit from
some treatment. One has QALE=80 without treatment and 81 with, and the other has
QALE=20 without treatment and 21 with. Their gains would be equal, but the second is
expected to get much less lifetime health. Hence, if an equal distribution of lifetime health in
the population is a priority, one would value the set {80, 21} above {81, 20}. The view that
expected lifetime health is what matters draws support from the literature on health priorities
and some empirical studies [24-28]. Note that although QALE often increases with age, a
high age does not necessarily correspond to a high QALE. E.g., the QALE of an old person
who has experienced a lifetime of chronic illness may be far less than that of a healthy child.
In this paper we focus on applications of the lifetime health perspective.

Our aim is the development of a systematic and explicit approach to empirically include these
equity concerns in the framework of CEAs, by creating a new priority weight function. The
function should be smooth and continuous in order to treat people with similar characteristics
alike. Further, it should be flexible regarding shape and outcome measure to be able to
encompass a broad range of values. Finally, coefficients should have distinct roles, to ensure
that different functions can be easily compared, and allow for easy manipulation of the
function’s shape.

A social welfare function (SWF) is a function that represents the sacrifices that society is
willing to make to promote a more equitable health distribution. The input should be a health
distribution (individual QALYs, DALYs, etc.), and the output should be a real number, so
that different distributions can be easily ranked. An SWF incorporates trade-offs between
total health gain and health inequality in a population. Well-known SWFs are the Gini index
and the Atkinson index [29, 30]. Both include a parameter that indicates the degree of
inequality aversion, ranging from 0 to infinite. Such SWFs are data hungry, because complete
data about the health or health gains for an entire population are needed. Often the data
required does not even exist. A different set of SWFs is the one based on the aggregated
QALY model. These utilitarian SWFs have the form

problem by considering priority weight functions (PWs) instead. These are functions that

Flexibility is an important property of a PW, as it should be able to reflect a wide range of
health related equity concerns. Further, if the coefficients of the PW have distinct roles, they
can easily be adjusted to accommodate such concerns. E.g., one may wish to set an upper
limit for the maximum weight, or set the maximum weight at a fixed value of t. Also, if the
PW is fit to empirical data on people’s preferences, the roles of the coefficients will help to
disentangle different concerns of society. One may, e.g., wish to estimate both the t for which
the PW reaches its maximum, and what the maximum is. This is not straightforward in (5). A
PW should also be twice differentiable with respect to t, so that it is continuous (no jumps)
and smooth (no breaking points), ensuring the approximately equal treatment of individuals
with similar values of t.

As demonstrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, manipulating the different coefficients of (7)
allows us to flexibly change its shape. E.g., if we want to ensure that people with a certain
value of t are given a certain weight (anchoring the curve), we may simply change . Letting

If α , A, γ, w and β are given, we can treat (8) and (9) as two linear equations with two
unknowns, and solve for C and α. Figure 3A shows (7) anchored to 1 at t  80 for different
values of w .
As mentioned, manipulating γ will shift (7) right or left. It may be of particular interest to
identify the shift needed to ensure that the maximum is moved to t  0. This means that the
slope is flat at t  0, and gradually becomes steeper, so that gains for most individuals with
poor lifetime health are given weights close to w . Differentiating (7) with respect to t, we
find that the maximum is when t  1/β. Hence, letting γ  1/β ensures that the maximum
is at t  0 (Figure 3B). Differentiating (7) once more with respect to t, the t for which the
slope is the steepest can be identified as 2/β. Therefore, letting γ  2/β causes (7) to be at

So far the mathematical properties of the coefficients in (7) have been presented, but the
policy implications and conceptual meaning of these properties may not be obvious. The next
paragraphs are dedicated to the discussion of these implications. First, we consider . If
, it is possible that

 . This makes sense if one thinks
that small gains to individuals with almost no lifetime health should be worth less than a
similar gain to an individual with more lifetime health. This could pertain to treatment of
children born with very severe conditions. In Figure 1 and Figure 2 the default value of was
0.04, so that the maximum was at
QALYs, which is probably too high in
most scenarios. When
, a gain of, e.g., 1 QALY will always be weighted higher for
the individual with the least lifetime health. From now on we shall assume that

Next we consider . The particular value of is not necessarily easy to interpret, but because
this coefficient allows for the anchoring of the PW at a certain weight for a certain value of t,
it is useful when selecting a reference value of t for which PW=1 (e.g., one may anchor PW at
1 when QALE=70). Once a reference is chosen, the interpretation of the other coefficients is
easier. A large corresponds to a narrow peak of the PW, ensuring a steep decline of the
curve. Now, gains to individuals with little lifetime health are given much higher weights than
gains to individuals with more lifetime health, whereas gains to individuals with intermediate
and high levels of lifetime health will be weighted similarly. A small yields a flat peak, so
that the weight drops steadily as the initial health level improves (t increases). Although
also will affect the range of possible weights, this property is more closely connected to the C.
The choice of C decides how much value will be assigned to a given t relative to the
reference. E.g., one may think that the maximum weight should be no more than three times
the weight of the reference. A very small C would ensure that all health gains were treated
almost the same.

Application of the priority weight function to experimental data

34

In order to illustrate the potential use of (7) in a CEA within a lifetime health framework, we
fit the function to data from a discrete choice experiment. The procedure involves two
conceptually simple steps. First, data must be collected, and then the curve must be fit.
However, both these steps may be performed a number of different ways. We shall focus on
an approach that is suitable for a dataset presented in Ottersen et al. (2014).

Ottersen et al. used a computer based questionnaire to ask 96 students in Norway how they
valued QALYs gained for people at different initial health levels, measured in “initial QALE”
(QALE without intervention). The reference case was a group of healthy people with
QALE=70 who were subject to an intervention that would give them 10 extra QALYs (i.e.,
move from QALE=70 to QALE=80). Respondents were asked to assign QALYs to

individuals with worse initial health (QALEs in the set {10, 25, 40, 55}) in such a way that
they were indifferent between the different scenarios. Now, priority weights could be
calculated for each individual respondent based on the ratio between the QALYs assigned to
the unhealthy groups and the reference group. E.g., consider a respondent who was indifferent
between a situation where the group with initial QALE=25 gained 5 QALYs (i.e., moving
from 25 to 30) and the reference group gained 10 QALYs (i.e., moving from 70 to 80). This
would mean that gains in the group with a worse initial health, where initial QALE=25, are
regarded as more important than gains in the healthy group, where initial QALE=70.
Mathematically, this extra weight can be expressed as V(25)=10/5=2 relative to the reference
group (QALE=70). We refer to Ottersen et al. for a more thorough discussion of data and
study design.

12
13
14

16

One may organize the data as follows. Two lists, V and T, are constructed. V contains all the
weights assigned by the respondents, and T contains the initial QALEs, so that the weight Vi
corresponds to the QALE Ti. For purposes of estimating the coefficients of (7), we treat the
observations as independent. Applying a least squares approach, we get that the sum of
squared errors (SSE) is

If one wishes to anchor the curve to a specific value (e.g., the data from Ottersen et al. has
V(70)=1), it is straightforward to use (8) in (10). Setting maximum weights would imply
using (9) in (10). Also, any coefficient in (10) may be kept constant.

Minimizing SSE ensures that the curve is fit to the mean V for each T in {10, 25, 40, 55}.

We have presented a new priority weight function (PW) with key characteristics that are
important in consistent priority setting across patient groups and populations. As
demonstrated, the PW was suitable for CEA in a lifetime health framework. The PW is
flexible and easy to adjust to a broad range of equity considerations by altering a limited
number of comprehensible parameters, each with its distinct role. We may set the range of
priority weights by modifying , we may shift the curve upwards or downwards by modifying
, we may shift the curve left or right by modifying and we may set the “pointiness” of the
curve by modifying . These characteristics make it easy, e.g., to anchor the curve or to set
maximum weights. Considering (11) and (13) (Figure 4), we see that 

indicating that PWmedian decreases at a faster rate than PWmean (i.e., PWmedian is pointier).
Further, we have that 
 , meaning that PWmean adds more weight to the worse
off than does PWmedian.

Drawing the PW by hand would of course be more flexible than using (7). However, we argue
that setting some restrictions for the behaviour of the PW is useful. First, it offers consistency
when comparing different curves. Second, the space of possible PWs is limited by (7), but the
major restrictions caused by (7) seem reasonable (smooth and maximum one hump). Hence, a
large number of nonsensical PWs are impossible (discontinuous and multiple humps).

We did not account for discounting of future health. It is not clear how this would affect
rankings of interventions. A positive discount rate would put different weights on equally
sized gains that were experienced at different times from the start of intervention (e.g., 0.5
QALYs gained immediately is valued higher than 0.1 QALYs gained each year in five years,
or 0.5 QALYs five years from now). Hence, interventions with immediate effects would be
valued over interventions where the benefit occurs in the future. Also, discounting health
gains would give a relatively low priority to those with large gains, who are expected to have
less lifetime health. This is counterintuitive in a lifetime health priority perspective.

Although we do give an example of how priority preferences can be inferred from data, future
work includes developing methodology to do inference about parameter estimates based on
data from discrete-choice experiments. This would allow for the testing of differences in
preferences between groups. E.g., conditioning on the other variables, one could test if men
and women preferred different values of (determining the maximum weight) or
(determining the t for which the maximum weight was obtained). When an appropriate PW
(or a range of PWs) has been selected, it could be applied to evaluate the equity impact of
different interventions on reduction of mortality or morbidity. Also, work should be done to

In this paper we do not intend to determine which PW is the most appropriate, but rather to
illustrate what can be achieved by a flexible general PW. However, we would like to stress
the fact that a flat PW is also a PW. In other words, there is no such thing as “not using a PW”
in CEA. As illustrated, our framework allows for the estimation of PWs based on empirical
data.
