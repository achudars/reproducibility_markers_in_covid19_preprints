ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Testosterone products are increasingly being prescribed to males for a variety
of possible health benefits but the causal relationship between testosterone and health-related
outcomes is unclear. Evidence from well-powered randomized controlled trials are difficult to
obtain, particularly regarding effects on long-term or adverse outcomes. We sought to determine
the effects of genetically-predicted calculated free testosterone (CFT) on 23 health outcomes.
METHODS: Genetic variants associated with CFT were determined from 136,531 white British
males in the UK Biobank. One-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses
were performed to infer the effects of genetically-predicted CFT on 23 health outcomes selected
based on relevance with known or suspected effects of testosterone therapy.
FINDINGS: In males from the UK Biobank, 81 independent genetic variants were associated with
CFT levels at genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8). Each 0.1 nmol/L increase in geneticallypredicted CFT was associated with clinical benefits on increased heel bone mineral density (0.053
SD; 95% CI = 0.038 to 0.068; p=8.77x10-12) and decreased body fat percentage (-1.86%; 95% CI
= -2.35 to -1.37; p=1.56x10-13), and adverse effects on increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.28;
95% CI=1.11 to 1.49; p=1.0x10-3), risk of androgenic alopecia (OR=1.82; 95% CI = 1.55 to 2.14;
p=3.52x10-13), risk of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (OR=1.81; 95% CI = 1.34 to 2.44;
p=1.05x10-4) and hematocrit percentage (1.49%; 95% CI = 1.24 to 1.74; p=3.49x10-32).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term elevated free testosterone levels cause prostate cancer, BPH, and
hair loss while reducing body fat percentage and increasing bone density. It also has a neutral
effect on type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes. Well powered randomized
trials are needed to address the effects of shorter term use of exogenous testosterone on these
outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
In developed countries, rising rates of both serum testosterone level testing and therapy
initiation have been observed among older male patients1,2. In the USA, it is estimated 1.5-1.7%
of males are currently prescribed testosterone3,4. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have
attempted to elucidate the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy5,6. These studies identified
short-term beneficial effects on BMD7, sexual function8, body fat and muscle mass9, and
anemia10,11; potential adverse effects on erythrocytosis10,11, venous thrombosis12 and coronary
artery plaque13; and no effects on cognitive function14, liver fat15, fatigue8, or haemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c)16. However, given the logistic and financial challenges involved in a well-powered RCT
with appropriate follow-up, there is unlikely to be satisfactory evidence regarding long-term
effects and risks of adverse outcomes, such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and cancer5.
Given the rates of testosterone prescription, efforts to resolve the causal effects of testosterone on
health outcomes have important public health implications6.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a technique for causal inference that leverages the
random allocation of genetic variants to infer the unconfounded relationship between an
exposure and outcome. Similar to the random assignment of participants to experimental groups
in a RCT, genetic variants are randomly allocated at meiosis17. For instance, if individuals
genetically randomized to produce higher testosterone develop different rates of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), then MR analysis supports a causal effect of testosterone on risk of CVD
(Supplementary Figure 1). Notably, this technique has previously replicated RCT findings,
among others demonstrating causal roles for LDL cholesterol and dysglycemia on CVD risk18,19.
Prior MR studies investigating the effects of testosterone have demonstrated harmful effects on
lipid levels but inconsistent effects on CVD20,21. However, these studies have been limited by the
small number of genetic variants and the use of total testosterone as opposed to free testosterone

levels. Free testosterone is better representative of the effects of testosterone in the body, since
total testosterone encompasses biologically inactive testosterone bound to transporter proteins22.
Accordingly, studies have shown the main transporter of testosterone, sex hormone-binding
globulin (SHBG), is a strong predictor of CVD risk factors independent of total testosterone and
may be a source of confounding23. To date, there have been no MR studies investigating the
effects of free testosterone.
We hypothesized that MR analyses would enable us to estimate the causal effects of
longstanding exposure to high levels of free testosterone on selected health-related outcomes that
have been previously investigated in randomized clinical trials of testosterone therapy. We first
conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for calculated free testosterone (CFT) in
male participants of the UK Biobank (n = 136,531) cohort to identify genetic determinants of
free testosterone levels. Then, using MR, we investigated the causal effects of lifelong
genetically-elevated free testosterone levels on various health outcomes, encompassing: expected
clinical benefits (physical activity, strength, fat-free body mass, body fat, BMD, dementia,
depression) and potential adverse effects (androgenic alopecia, haematocrit, type 2 diabetes, liver
fat, prostate cancer, blood pressure, CVD, heart failure, ischemic stroke) (Figure 1)5–10,14–16,24.
METHODS
Study Population - UK Biobank
The UK Biobank is a large-scale longitudinal cohort study that recruited over 500,000
people between the ages of 37-73 across the United Kingdom from 2006-201025. Extensive
health information was collected through self-reported medical histories and physical measures
at recruitment, and ongoing health developments through linked electronic health records. UK
Biobank received ethical approval from the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics

Committee (REC reference: 11/NW/0382). This research was conducted using the UK Biobank
under Application Number 15255.
Calculation of Free Testosterone
For our analyses, males in the UK Biobank were excluded if they had reported taking any
androgen medication at recruitment based on field ID 20003 (n = 2,137). Free testosterone was
calculated using the Vermeulen equation22 with levels of serum total testosterone, SHBG, and
albumin measured at recruitment. CFT levels were winsorized such that outlying values greater
or less than 4 standard deviations (SD) away from the mean in males were set to 4 SD.
Genome-wide Association Study of Calculated Free Testosterone
For genome-wide association testing, UK Biobank samples were restricted to a subset of
white British ancestry that were unrelated (greater than 3rd degree). Genetic variants were
restricted to those present in the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel26 with imputation
quality greater than 0.6, no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 1x10-10) and minor
allele frequency greater than 0.1% (equivalent to approximately 150 copies of the minor allele in
this male subset). After these exclusions, almost 12 million directly genotyped or imputed
genetic variants were left in the model. BGENIE v1.2 27 was used to run an additive genetic
model in male participants from this subset of the UK Biobank. The model was adjusted for age,
age2, chip type, assessment centre, and the first 20 genetic principal components.
Genetic variants near the SHBG gene have been shown to alter binding affinity for
testosterone thereby violating assumptions of the Vermeulen equation28, and SHBG risks having
pleiotropic effects through its binding of other sex hormones. Therefore, we tested genetic
variants associated with CFT reaching genome-wide significance (GWS) (p £ 5x10-8) for
evidence of association with natural log-transformed SHBG levels in the same subset of the UK
Biobank (Supplementary Figure 2). Any genetic variants associated with SHBG (p<0.05) were

removed. To arrive at an independent set of genetic variants, variants associated with CFT but
not associated with SHBG were pruned based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) at a threshold of
r2<0.01. The reference panel for LD was derived from 1000 Genomes Europeans phase 3 29.
Selection of Health-Related UK Biobank Outcomes
Thirty-one health outcomes were selected based on relevance with known or suspected
effects of testosterone therapy, and they were classified based on expected beneficial or adverse
effects from randomized clinical trial data. Outcomes with expected beneficial effects were
fractures at any site, heel BMD, body fat percentage, dementia, depression, erectile dysfunction,
handgrip strength, physical activity level measured by wrist-worn accelerometer, and whole
body fat-free mass. Outcomes with potential adverse effects were stroke, androgenic alopecia,
arterial embolism and thrombosis, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), blood pressure, glucose,
haematocrit percentage, haemoglobin A1c, heart failure, liver fat, prostate cancer, MI, testicular
cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and venous thromboembolism. Detailed descriptions of all
outcomes are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Methods. Given the small
number of cases for several outcomes, power calculations were performed for MR analyses using
a significance level of 0.05, and any outcomes with detectable odds ratios less than 0.5 or greater
than 2 per 0.1 nmol/L at 80% power were excluded (Supplementary Table 2)30. After these
exclusions, there were 23 health outcomes that remained for subsequent MR analyses in this
study.
The association of all independent genetic variants associated with CFT were determined
for each of the 23 outcomes using additive genetic models in BGENIE v1.2 27 and adjusted for
the same covariates as the model for CFT. For dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios were
approximated as previously described31 by converting linear effect estimates to log-odds scale
using:

*(+,*)

, where k is the proportion of cases for the given outcome

Mendelian randomization – One-sample design
For each of the 23 outcomes, one-sample MR analysis was used to combine the effect of
each independent genetic variant on CFT with its effect on the outcome. Weighted median
method was used to infer the causal effect of CFT on the outcome, which selects the median
causal estimate after weighing estimates of each individual genetic variant according to their
variance32. The resulting estimate is robust to horizontal pleiotropy when at least 50% of weights
belong to valid genetic variants32. Given the polygenic nature of testosterone and potential for
pleiotropy, this method was selected to ensure reliable estimates. Outcomes were deemed
statistically significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing of 23 health outcomes using
Bonferroni correction (p<2.17x10-3). Effect estimates were reported per 0.1 nmol/L increase in
CFT levels based on approximate changes in response to testosterone therapy33,34.
Sensitivity analyses ensured effects weren’t driven by any single variant. For statistically
significant outcomes, leave-one-out analyses was performed where MR analysis was repeated
after each genetic variant was excluded. Furthermore, genetic variants were assessed for “weak
instrument bias”, which can result in biased estimates if genetic variants don’t explain enough
variance in CFT levels35. The F-statistic was 4952 for the genetic variants used in this MR,
which was considered a strong instrument based on the recommended threshold of greater than
10 35.
Mendelian randomization – Two-sample design
Given the limited number of cases in the UK Biobank for dichotomous outcomes, the
data were supplemented using results from 10 publicly-available studies published elsewhere.
Data from these independent studies were analyzed using a two-sample MR approach with the
81 genetic variants associated with CFT from the UK Biobank, and the association of each CFT7

associated genetic variant with the outcome was obtained from the published GWAS. Generally,
two-sample MR has the advantage of enabling the use of larger sample sizes and biases estimates
towards the null under weak instrument conditions. We identified 10 publicly available GWAS
summary statistics corresponding to dichotomous outcomes used in the one-sample MR analysis
(Supplementary Table 3)36–41. For each outcome, MR analysis was similarly performed using the
weighted median method. For male-specific outcomes, MR effect estimates from two-sample
and one-sample analyses were meta-analysed under a fixed effects model using the meta package
in R42.
Mendelian randomization - Age-stratified
Given age-related decline in testosterone levels and selection criteria in RCTs, we
stratified the UK Biobank male participants into two groups based on age at recruitment above or
below 65 years to investigate differential effects of free testosterone levels in these age groups.
For significant outcomes from the MR analysis (p<2.17x10-3), one-sample MR analysis was
repeated as described previously separately in each subgroup to interrogate the effect of CFT on
the given outcome according to age. P-values for heterogeneity between age groups were
calculated under a fixed effects model in the meta package.
All MR analyses were implemented using the TwoSampleMR package43. All statistical
analyses were performed under R version 3.6.0, unless otherwise specified. A two-sided p-value
less than 5x10-8 for GWAS, 2.17x10-3 (0.05/23 outcomes) for standard MR analyses, and 0.05 for
heterogeneity in age-stratified MR analyses was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Genetic determinants of calculated free testosterone in males
There were 158,870 males in the unrelated white, British subset of the UK Biobank
cohort. To calculate free testosterone levels, we excluded individuals that had missing levels of
total testosterone, SHBG and albumin, or self-reported taking androgen medications. After these
exclusions, the study population consisted of 136,531 males with an average CFT of 0.21 nmol/L
(Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figure 3).
There were 9,150 genetic variants associated with CFT that reached GWS (p<5x10-8)
(Supplementary Figure 4). After removing genetic variants associated with natural-log
transformed SHBG and keeping only independent signals, there were 81 genetic variants carried
forward for subsequent genetic analyses (Supplementary Table 5). Altogether, these 81 genetic
variants explained 3.4% of the total variance of CFT levels in males from the UK Biobank.
Effect of free testosterone on 23 health outcomes using Mendelian randomization analysis
In males from the UK Biobank, sample size for the quantitative risk factors ranged from
1,595 to 156,403, while number of cases for dichotomous outcomes ranged from 1,003 to 70,283
(Table 1). After adjusting for the 23 outcomes tested, one-sample MR analysis identified
significant effects of CFT on haematocrit percentage, body fat percentage, heel BMD,
androgenic alopecia, and BPH (Table 1). Each 0.1 nmol/L higher CFT had beneficial effects on
increased heel BMD (0.053 SD; 95% CI = 0.038 to 0.068; p=8.77x10-12) and decreased body fat
percentage (-1.86%; 95% CI = -2.35 to -1.37; p=1.56x10-13), but deleterious effects on increased
haematocrit percentage (1.49%; 95% CI = 1.24 to 1.74; p=3.49x10-32), risk of androgenic

alopecia (OR=1.82; 95% CI = 1.55 to 2.14; p=3.52x10-13) and risk of BPH (OR=1.81; 95% CI =
1.34 to 2.44; p=1.05x10-4). Leave-one-out analyses did not identify any outlying individual
genetic variants responsible for the observed effects on any significant outcomes.
To increase the statistical power of the MR analyses, two-sample MR analysis was
performed for dichotomous outcomes using independent summary statistics from GWAS with
greater numbers of cases. Male-specific summary statistics were available for prostate cancer
from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer-Associated Alterations in the
Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium, and combined male and female summary statistics for 10
other dichotomous outcomes (Supplementary Table 3). The effect of CFT was directionally
consistent with the one-sample MR analysis for prostate cancer. Given no overlap between the
samples in the UK Biobank and PRACTICAL consortium summary statistics, effect estimates
were meta-analysed and reached statistical significance (OR=1.28; 95% CI=1.11 to 1.49;
p=1.0x10-3). Similarly, there was a consistent null effect observed for ischemic stroke and other
stroke subtypes, Alzheimer’s disease, and T2D (Supplementary Table 6), but these effect
estimates were not meta-analysed due to lack of available male-specific summary statistics.
Differential effects of free testosterone on health outcomes according to age subgroups
To identify differential effects of CFT between age groups, we repeated MR analysis in
males from the UK Biobank stratified according to participant’s age below or above 65 years.
Age-specific effects of CFT were then determined for statistically significant (p<2.17x10-3)
outcomes from MR analyses. Genetically-elevated CFT showed a risk-conferring effect on BPH
(OR = 1.80; 95% CI= 1.22 to 2.65; p=2.89x10-3) and prostate cancer (OR = 2.02; 95% CI= 1.29
to 3.65; p=2.10x10-3) specific to males under 65 years of age (pheterogeneity= 0.019 for BPH and
0.038 for prostate cancer) (Supplementary Figure 5). Androgenic alopecia, haematocrit

percentage, body fat percentage, and heel BMD showed no significantly different effect in
participants above versus below 65 years of age.

DISCUSSION
We herein perform an MR analysis of CFT to identify effects of elevated endogenous
free testosterone in males on 23 health outcomes. MR analyses demonstrated that each 0.1
nmol/L increase in CFT was associated with adverse effects on increased risk of prostate cancer,
risk of androgenic alopecia, risk of BPH, and hematocrit percentage, but beneficial effects on
increased heel BMD and decreased body fat percentage. These findings are consistent with shortterm effects in randomized trials of testosterone therapy, and opposite effects of 5a-reductase
inhibitors – inhibiting the conversion of testosterone into the more potent dihydrotestosterone –
as a treatment for androgenic alopecia and BPH6,44,45. Furthermore, MR analyses showed no
effect of free testosterone on several hard endpoints, such as dementia, MI, stroke, fractures, and
T2D. Accordingly, these results cast doubt on claims of cardiovascular risk or benefit for
testosterone therapy46.
After meta-analysis of MR results from the UK Biobank and PRACTICAL consortium
studies, there was a statistically significant risk-conferring effect of free testosterone on prostate
cancer (p=1.0x10-3). Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer and second leading cause of
cancer death among men in the USA47. Androgen suppression has long been used as treatment
for both BPH48 and prostate cancer45. However, there is inconclusive RCT evidence regarding
the effects of elevated testosterone via either endogenous or exogenous means on development
of BPH or prostate cancer49. These MR results suggest 1.3-fold increased risk of prostate cancer
per 0.1 nmol/L increase in free testosterone levels, which is comparable to changes observed
after initiation of testosterone therapy33,34. Moreover, age-stratified analyses provided suggestive

evidence of a specific effect on BPH and prostate cancer in individuals under 65 years of age.
These findings warrant further investigation in clinical trials of exogenous testosterone
supplementation and calls for greater scrutiny in this patient population.
There are several limitations of this study. First, an assumption of the MR analysis is that
the effect of the genetic variant on the outcome occurs only through free testosterone levels, such
that there are no pleiotropic effects through other proteins or mechanisms17. This concern was
minimized by the use of multiple genetic variants, which limited the likelihood of a common
alternative pathway confounding our observation. Moreover, we performed standard sensitivity
analyses and excluded genetic variants associated with SHBG levels, which is a potential source
of pleiotropy through its effects on other hormones. Additionally, one-sample MR may be
susceptible to bias towards the confounded estimate if the genetic variants are “weak
instruments”, which can occur if the genetic variants don’t explain enough of the variance in free
testosterone levels35. To address this concern, we confirmed the selected genetic variants were
strong instruments using a common threshold in MR literature (F-statistic > 10)35. Furthermore,
two-sample MR analyses afforded larger sample sizes for certain dichotomous outcomes, and
yielded a risk-conferring effect of CFT on prostate cancer and nonsignificant effects on
Alzheimer’s disease, coronary heart disease, stroke subtypes, and T2D. However, besides
prostate cancer, these results should be interpreted with caution as these GWAS summary
statistics didn’t provide sex-specific genetic estimates (Supplementary Table 3). Consequently, if
the effect of CFT genetic associations are male-specific, the causal effect of free testosterone in
males may have been diluted or counteracted by the inclusion of females. Finally, these MR
results represent lifelong effects of endogenous free testosterone and may not necessarily reflect

effects of exogenous testosterone therapy, which can vary in duration, age of initiation, and
dosage.
Taken altogether, the decision to initiate long-term testosterone use warrants careful
consideration of benefits and risk. From a lifestyle perspective, beneficial effects on body fat
percentage and sexual function should be weighed against detrimental effects on androgenic
alopecia and adverse urinary symptoms arising from BPH. From a clinical perspective, there
may be a beneficial effect on hematocrit percentage and BMD but no significant effects on hard
clinical endpoints (e.g., CVD, fracture, and T2D) except a risk-conferring effect on prostate
cancer with evidence of a possible effect specific to younger males. Ultimately, well-designed
and appropriately powered RCTs, such as the ongoing TRAVERSE trials (clinicaltrials.gov,
NCT03518034), are necessary to conclusively address questions of safety and effectiveness of
testosterone therapy. However, as demonstrated in this study, genetically-informed analyses can
be powerful tools to aid health professionals in prioritizing allocation of limited resources
towards investigating the most pressing questions.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Flowchart depicting overall study design. Free testosterone levels were calculated in
males from the UK Biobank cohort. Then, genetic variants were tested for association with levels
of CFT and carried forward if: genome-wide significant (p<5x10-8) and unassociated with SHBG
(p<0.05). These genetic variants represent genetically-predicted CFT (using variants unrelated to
SHBG) and were tested for association with each of 23 health outcomes using Mendelian
randomization. One-sample MR was performed using associations with 23 outcomes in males
from the UK Biobank. Then, two-sample MR was performed using 10 dichotomous outcomes
from independent cohorts with larger sample sizes. When male-specific summary statistics were
available from independent cohorts, MR effect estimates were meta-analyzed. For statistically
significant outcomes adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing (p<0.05/23), one-sample MR was
repeated within age subgroups to identify differential effects in participants above versus below
65 years of age. CFT, calculated free testosterone; MR, Mendelian randomization; TT, total
testosterone; SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin
