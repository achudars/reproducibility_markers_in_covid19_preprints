Abstract
Neither primary health care or family and community medicine are recognized as
knowledge areas in Brazil, for the purpose of postgraduate education (master’s, Ph.D.) or
research. Our objective was to describe the postgraduate education trajectories of family and
community physicians in Brazil. In this observational, exploratory study, we used data from
SBMFC and SisCNRM to compile the list of physicians and community physicians, and then
downloaded their curricula vitae from the Lattes Platform, verifying all data for consistency.
A master’s degree was held by one in eight, and a Ph.D., by one in forty; most degrees were
in collective health. Women (versus men) were less likely to hold master’s degrees, and even
less likely to hold Ph.D. degrees. Professional (versus academic) master’s degrees and those
in other areas (versus in medicine or collective health) were also associated with lower
probability of obtaining a Ph.D. degree. Certified specialists (versus those with a medical
residency) with a postgraduate degree were more likely to have earned it before becoming
family and community physicians. We suggest that researchers in public health critically
examine the relative benefits of different postgraduate trajectories for the professional
performance of family and community physicians.

Introduction
In the second half of the 20th century, family medicine differentiated from general
practice as a result of the increased appreciation of the importance of primary health care, the
psychosocial aspects of health and the complexity of causation.1–3 “General practitioners” in
countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are expected to undergo
postgraduate training (medical residency), and thus are family physicians by another name.4–6
In Brazil, emphasis on primary health care coincided with the fight for
redemocratization, culminating in the establishment of a national health system called
Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS; Unified Health System).1,7–10 The origin of family medicine in
Brazil, however, was everything but unified. In the 1970s, movements called community
medicine (medicina comunitária) and comprehensive medicine (medicina integral) merged
into a medical specialty then called community general medicine (medicina geral
comunitária).1,7–9 In 2000-2001, after SUS started expanding access to primary health care
through the Family Health Strategy (then Family Health Program, conceived based on
community general medicine and other inputs

7,11,12

), community general medicine resolved

its differences with family medicine, resulting in a medical specialty now called family and
community medicine (medicina de família e comunidade, MFC).1,8 Preventive and social
medicine (medicina preventiva e social) remains a separate specialty, despite the partially
overlapping scope of practice.1
The concepts of “field of competence” and “core competence”

13

have been

considered useful for understanding the interplay between the disciplines of primary health
care and family and community medicine.9 Family and community medicine having its core
competences does not preclude it from sharing primary health care as a field of competence,
or vice-versa. Even though McWhinney and Freeman have argued family medicine to be an

academic discipline separate from other medical disciplines,2,14,15 they also recognize
distinctions among disciplines are sometimes more administrative and historical than
epistemological.2
In Brazil, though, neither primary health care, nor family and community medicine
are acknowledged as knowledge areas in the official “tree of knowledge” adopted by CAPES
(the Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education), CNPq (the National
Council for Scientific and Technological Development) and FINEP (the Funding Authority
for Studies and Projects). This means research grant applications and postgraduate programs
(master’s and Ph.D.) must be registered in correlated basic knowledge areas, such as
interdisciplinary, medicine or collective health, or in some subarea or specialty within those
basic knowledge areas. In Latin America, “collective health” comprises (among other
definitions 16) public health, epidemiology and humanities and social sciences in health.17
Accordingly, there are only a few postgraduate programs on primary health care or
Family Health

18–21

(but no one on family and community medicine, that we know of) in

Brazil, and university departments dedicated to primary health care and/or family and
community medicine are exceedingly rare. Brazilian journals on primary health care and/or
family and community medicine have little prestige, and thus a substantial part of relevant
research is expected to be published in other, more general journals (this is not specific to
Brazil

22

). All this makes it very hard to gather a comprehensive understanding of the

postgraduate education and research in primary health care and/or family and community
medicine.
In this study, we hope to shed some light on the postgraduate education of primary
health care professionals in Brazil by using specialization in family and community medicine
as a way to identify physicians more likely to be involved with primary health care. Our
objective was to explore their trajectories in postgraduate education (master’s and Ph.D.),

describing the characteristics of their postgraduate degrees as well as correlating such degrees
with characteristics of the physicians and their previous training.

Methods
In this article, we report results from an observational, exploratory study, integrating
secondary data from multiple sources: the Trajetórias MFC project.

Data sources
We compiled the list of family and community physicians in Brazil from two sources,
corresponding to the two modes of recognition as an specialist for physicians in Brazil.23 One
mode is certification by the corresponding specialty association. Such specialty certificates
are conferred to physicians with either experience or a medical residency who pass an exam
occurring once or twice every year, since 2003.3,8 We obtained the list of certified family and
community physicians, as of late November 2018, from Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina de
Família e Comunidade (SBMFC, the Brazilian Society of Family and Community Medicine),
corresponding to the first 24 editions of the specialist certification exam. For physicians
having renewed their certification (which is not required), we kept only data on their first
certification.
The other way of being recognized as an specialist is completing a medical residency.
In late December 2018, we downloaded spreadsheets from SisCNRM (the information
system for medical residency) on both family and community medicine and general
community medicine (that is, from after and before the specialty was renamed) and merged
the lists. Again, for the few physicians having completed a medical residency more than
once, we kept only data on their first medical residency.
After obtaining the data from both sources, we merged the lists into a single list of
family and community physicians, using both the name and the CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas

Físicas) registry identification number. We verified this compiled list extensively for internal
consistency, resorting to Web searches and to looking up in the Lattes Platform when
additional information was necessary.
Lattes Platform is the Brazilian information system on science, technology, and
innovation. Created in 1999, its curricula vitae (CVs) tend to be quite complete because they
are used for decisions on research funding and on recruitment, promotion and tenure.24
Furthermore, CVs in the Lattes Platform tend to be honest because researchers are
accountable for the information they provide. In example, their individual CVs are publicly
available as Web pages and eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files.
After compiling the list of family and community physicians, we found their online
CV Web pages using specially crafted uniform resource locators (URLs) including their CPF
or looking up the Lattes Platform using the physicians’ names. Then, we obtained their Lattes
Platform ID number by scraping these Web pages, and downloaded the corresponding CVs in
XML format in late December 2018.
After extracting data on the postgraduate courses from the Lattes XML files, we hand
checked each entry to make sure the data corresponded to actual postgraduate programs and
each entry with a postgraduate program included the corresponding ID code. This hand
checking included looking up the postgraduate programs in the Sucupira Platform (the
Brazilian information system on postgraduate programs)25 and searching the Web for the
monographs (titles are often included in the Lattes CV, and monographs are often publicly
available). Then we obtained further data on the postgraduate programs from the Sucupira
Platform, by scraping their web pages corresponding to each postgraduate program. For
international programs, we imputed the code for the knowledge area and the mode of the
master’s degree by hand, based on the program title.

Variables
We inferred gender from the physician’s first name, using data from the 2010
Brazilian Census

26

cached in the genderBR package (version 1.1.0).27 First names were

considered female if they had 50%+ probability of belonging to a woman, and male if
otherwise; names appearing less than 20 times in the Census were not assigned any gender.
The date when the Lattes CVs were last updated was retrieved from CVs themselves.
When the physician had both completed a medical residency and received a specialty
certificate, we considered whichever came first as the mode of specialization. The year of
specialization, master’s or Ph.D. completion was categorized in five-year periods, with the
first period (up to 1998, the last year before inception of the Lattes Platform) having an open
beginning. Likewise, the states where the specialization, master’s or Ph.D. took place were
grouped into the five geographical regions (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and CentralWest), with an extra category for international postgraduate programs (Supplemental Table 28
lists data for individual states). The knowledge areas were handled at the “basic knowledge
area” level (that is, not at the “greater knowledge area” level, nor at the “sub-area” or
“speciality” levels), and areas other than medicine or collective health were grouped in a
catchall category (Supplemental Table

28

lists data for individual basic knowledge areas).

Master’s degrees were also categorized according to their mode, that is, according to whether
they were academic or professional. While both modes involve immersion in research, the
academic master’s courses aim to produce researchers, and the professional ones aim to
produce better professionals for outside academia.29,30 Professional Ph.D. courses are very
recent, and we didn't expect any degree to have been earned yet.

Analysis
Categorical data were described with absolute and relative frequencies, and
continuous data were described with medians and interquartile ranges (IQR).

Besides describing gender and characteristics of specialization and of master’s and
Ph.D. degrees, we also described the frequency of master’s degrees among family and
community physicians according to their gender and characteristics of specialization, as well
as the frequency of Ph.D. degrees according to the same characteristics as well as to the
characteristics of the master’s degree. Because the interpretation of the year of specialization
depends on whether the specialization was through medical residency or through
certification, year and mode of specialization were merged into a single variable for the
purpose of describing the frequency of master’s and Ph.D. degrees.
The association of the before-mentioned explanatory variables with having earned a
master’s degree (one response variable) or Ph.D. (another response variable) was expressed
with the odds ratio (OR). While the prevalence ratio could be more intuitive, the OR better
approximates the incidence density (rate) ratio.31 The OR were estimated through logistic
regression both with a single and with multiple explanatory variables at a time, and were
expressed as point estimates and 95% uncertainty interval. All regression coefficients
(including the intercept) had weakly informative prior distributions,32 and inference was
based on the No-U-Turn sampler.33 Year and mode of specialization were entered in such
regression models separately along with an interaction term between them, but for ease of
understanding the results were presented as if there was a single “year and mode of
specialization” variable.
In the multivariable model for the Ph.D. degree, we opted for a hierarchical
framework.34 The “distal level” included gender and characteristics of the specialization, and
the “proximal level” included characteristics of the master’s. Variables in the distal level had
their OR adjusted for other variables in the distal level, and variables in the proximal level
had their OR adjusted for all other variables in the model, from both levels.
Time from specialization to master’s and Ph.D. degrees, and between the two later

ones, was described both in general and according to the mode of specialization. We also
examined the distribution of the knowledge areas of the master’s degrees according to the
mode of specialization, and the distribution of knowledge areas of Ph.D. degrees according to
the mode of specialization and the knowledge area of the master’s. We did not examine the
distribution of the knowledge area of the Ph.D. degree according to the mode of the master’s,
because too few family and community physicians with a professional master’s earned a
Ph.D.. When describing the distribution of the knowledge area of the Ph.D. according to the
knowledge area of the master’s, we opted for an alluvial diagram.
The data were analyzed using R (version 3.6.1).35 While data verification by hand
involved spreadsheet applications from office suites, most data processing (including the
tabulation of frequencies) was done within R itself, using packages centered around the
concept of “tidy data”,36 as well as packages specific to Brazilian data.27,37 For regression
modelling we used brms (version 2.10.0),38 which builds on the Stan probabilistic
programming language

39

through rstan (version 2.19.2).40 The alluvial diagram was made

with ggalluvial (version 0.10.0).41

Ethics
While most of the data sources we used are publicly available, there were two privacy
issues. First, the spreadsheet SBMFC provided us with the complete list of certificates
(including the CPF number of most) is not publicly available as such. Second, while all data
we obtained from the Lattes Platform are publicly available, they lied behind technology
clearly intended no hinder data mining. Thus, before initiating the data collection we obtained
approval by the research ethics committee of Universidade Vila Velha (certificate
02957118.2.0000.5064). Because our data is personally identifiable, it will be available to
other researchers only if they present an ethically-approved research project with an analysis
plan 42.

Results
The first 24 editions of the specialist certification exam resulted in the emission of
2816 certificates, amounting to 2795 unique physicians. Furthermore, 3959 medical
residencies were completed (936 in general community medicine and 3023 after it was
renamed family and community medicine), amounting to 3957 unique physicians. Because
514 physicians both concluded a medical residency and were certified, there were 6238
unique family and community physicians. Of these, 4065 (65.2%) had a CV in the Lattes
Platform. Median time since these CVs were last updated was 1 year, with an IQR of 0–4
years and a maximum of 18 years.
Most family and community physicians (3563, 58.3%) were female, and the most
common mode of specialization was medical residency (3917, 62.8%) (Table 1). The number
of new family and community physicians clearly increased over time, with the largest
increases being from 1999–2003 to 2004–2008 and from 2009–2013 to 2014–2018.
Specialization in family and community medicine was concentrated in the Southeast and
South regions.
Table 1: Family and community physicians in Brazil, December 2018
A master’s degree was obtained by 747 (12.0%) family and community physicians
(Table 2), with 554 (74.2%) degrees being academic and the other 193 (25.8%) being
professional. The number of new master’s degrees clearly increased with time, especially
from 2004–2008 to 2009–2013; from 2009–2013 to 2014–2018, the increase was restricted to
professional master’s degrees. As for specialization, master’s degrees were concentrated in
the Southeast and South regions, both for academic and professional degrees. Master’s
degrees in collective health (351, 47.0%) were twice as frequent as those in medicine (170,
22.8%), with other frequent knowledge areas being interdisciplinary (84, 11.2%), teaching
(30, 4.0%) and education (24, 3.2%). Professional degrees accounted for 104 (29.6%) of the

master’s degrees in collective health, but only 27 (15.9%) of those in medicine. The
postgraduate programs were spread across 141 institutions, with only eight of them having
conferred a master’s degree to at least 20 family and community physicians. Most family and
community physicians obtained their master’s degrees from Universidade Federal do Rio
Grande do Sul (UFRGS; Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul), Fundação Oswaldo Cruz
(Fiocruz; Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) or Universidade de São Paulo (USP; University of São
Paulo); more information on Supplemental Table 28.
Table 2: Master’s and Ph.D. degrees of family and community physicians in Brazil,
December 2018
A Ph.D. degree was held by 170 (2.7%) family and community physicians (Table 2).
There were no professional Ph.D. degrees. As with master’s degrees, there was an increase in
new Ph.D. degrees over time, and most degrees were obtained in the Southeast and South
regions of Brazil. Contrary to master’s degrees, Ph.D. degrees in medicine (64, 38%) were
almost as common as those in collective health (72, 42%). The postgraduate programs were
spread across 40 institutions, with only two of them (USP and UFRGS) having conferred
more than 20 degrees; more information on Supplemental Table 28.
Some groups of family and community physicians were less likely to hold a master’s
or Ph.D. degree, even after adjusting for other characteristics (Table 3, Table 4). Women
were less likely to hold a master’s degree than their male colleagues, and only half as likely
to hold a Ph.D.. Family and community physicians with a professional master’s degree were

 as likely to earn a Ph.D. degree as those with an academic master’s degree. A master’s
degree in other knowledge area also implicated lower likelihood of earning a Ph.D. than a
master’s in medicine or collective health.

community physicians in Brazil, 2018
Table 4: Characteristics associated with holding a Ph.D. degree among family and
community physicians in Brazil, 2018
Among those earning a master’s degree, median time from specialization to master’s
was 4 years (IQR, 0–6): 5 years (IQR, 3–8) for family and community physicians specializing
through medical residency, and 1 year (IQR, -3 to 4) for those specializing through
certification. In other words, earning a master’s degree came before specialization for 21.8%
family and community physicians: 9.1% for those specializing through medical residency,
and 39.9% for those specializing through certification. The proportion of master’s degrees in
each of the knowledge areas (medicine, collective health, other) was very similar across the
specialization modes (certification or medical residency) (data not shown).
Likewise, median time from specialization to Ph.D. degree was 9 years (IQR, 3.25–
12): 10 years (IQR, 7–14) for family and community physicians specializing through medical
residency, and 2 years (IQR, -2.5 to 9) for those specializing through certification. In other
words, earning a Ph.D. degree came before specialization for 16% family and community
physicians: 6% for those specializing through medical residency, and 33% for those
specializing through certification. As with the master’s degrees, the proportion of Ph.D.
degrees in each of the knowledge areas (medicine, collective health, other) was very similar
across the specialization modes (certification or medical residency) (data not shown).
Finally, median time from master's to Ph.D. degree was 4 years (IQR, 0–6). Most
family and community physicians earning a Ph.D. in collective health (50, 69%) also earned
a master’s in the same knowledge area (Graph 1). On the other hand, half of those earning a
Ph.D. in medicine earned a master’s in collective health (11, 17%) or no master’s at all (i.e.,
direct Ph.D.; 19, 30%). Most direct Ph.D. degrees (16, 53%), in medicine or otherwise, were

Discussion
Our findings indicate one in eight family and community physicians have earned a
master’s degree, and little more than one in forty have earned a Ph.D.. The number of new
degrees is increasing over time, and most of the degrees are in collective health (not
medicine) and were obtained in the Southeast and South regions. Gender is associated with
the probability of obtaining a master’s degree and, together with mode and knowledge area of
the master’s, also with that of obtaining a Ph.D. degree. In comparison to family and
community physicians specializing through medical residency, those specializing through
certification were more likely to already have earned a master’s and/or Ph.D. degree (instead
of earning after specialization), but just as likely to have earned their degree in medicine,
collective health or other knowledge areas.
Professional master’s programs are responsible for most of the recent increase in the
number of master’s degrees, and might be attracting graduate students who would otherwise
opt for academic programs. The Northeast region, with its RENASF network of institutions
offering a professional master’s program focused on the Family Health Strategy,19,20 accounts
for part of this increase, as does the state of Rio de Janeiro, whose capital city recently
invested heavily in the expansion of the Family Health Strategy and incentivized health
professionals to earn master’s degrees;21 but the increase in professional master’s degrees was
not restricted to these states (data not shown). Even though the ProfSaúde program

18

is

expected to contribute to this increase, it does not account for our findings, because its first
students graduated after we obtained our data.

Brazil has been promoting professional master’s on Family Health alongside other
qualification initiatives, such as residencies, short postgraduate courses and academic
master’s.21,30 While one would expect any qualification to contribute something, responsible
public policies for human resources in health depend on critically examining the relative
benefits of the multiple possible postgraduate trajectories. In example, some qualification
initiatives might add little to the performance of professionals who are already sufficiently
qualified, or who are not qualified enough to benefit from said initiatives. Furthermore, for
better or for worse, a professional master’s degree should increase employability in academia,
thereby increasing workforce turnover in the Family Health Strategy while contributing to the
education of the new generation of health professionals.
This debate is made even more timely by the advent of professional Ph.D. programs.
Graduates from professional master’s courses seem to be less likely to earn Ph.D. degrees,
even after adjusting for potential confounders, such as when was the master’s concluded.
Because graduates from professional programs are expected to be outside academia, they
might not find value in academic Ph.D. courses. It remains to be seen if professional Ph.D.
programs are needed to fill this niche, or if simply there’s not much use for any Ph.D. outside
academia. Meanwhile, physicians are still not required to complete medical residency (or
otherwise be certified) before working in primary care in Brazil, and posts in medical
residencies lag behind the annual number of newly graduated physicians (the same applies
for nurses).43
Another major finding is that most family and community physicians hold master’s
and Ph.D. degrees in collective health, not medicine. This phenomenon is more common for
master’s than for Ph.D. degrees, and for professional than for academic degrees, but it occurs
in both levels and both modes of postgraduate programs. We can’t say this came as a
surprise: of the authors who are family and community physicians, all three hold a Ph.D. in a

subarea of collective health. In our experience, not only has collective health devoted
substantial interest to primary health care as a public policy, but also the Brazilian medical
community hasn’t devoted much interest to primary care as a locus of healthcare delivery. In
example, searching for (“family medicine” OR “family and community medicine”) in the
SciELO Brazil collection, one of the top five journals is on medical education and the other
four are journals on collective health. This suggests most research on primary health care in
Brazil to be on health policy, service management and health promotion, as well as medical
education, but not so much on clinical care.
Most medical residencies, specialist certifications, masters’ and Ph.D. happened in the
Southeast and South regions. The reason is twofold: these are two of the most populous
regions (together with the Northeast region), and are the most economically developed ones.
These facts also reflect in the overall distribution of physicians in Brazil.44 Interestingly, our
data do not support a higher probability of obtaining a master’s or Ph.D. degree for family
and community physicians specializing or obtaining a master’s degree in the Southeast and
South regions. This is not to say our data support equity in access to postgraduate programs:
there simply are too few family and community physicians outside the Southeast and South
regions for us to make precise estimates. As the saying goes, “absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence [of effect]”.45
On the other hand, the association of gender and postgraduate degrees was very clear:
female family and community physicians are less likely to obtain master’s degrees than their
male colleagues, and even less so for Ph.D. degrees. This should not be interpreted as gender
having a direct effect on educational achievement: our study was exploratory, and inclusion
of gender as an explanatory variable was motivated mostly by the SAGER guidelines.46
Rather, this finding should taken as justification for further studies, aimed at a more proper
explanation for this correlation. Such explanation might have more to do with family and

community medicine than with the Brazilian society at large, because half the master’s and
Ph.D. graduates in Brazil are women.47 Besides the ethical relevance of elucidating and
preferably removing any gendered barriers to postgraduate education, the issue has special
relevance to the discipline because most family and community physicians are women.
In interpreting our findings, one must keep in mind we depended on administrative
data. Because data from Conselho Federal de Medicina (CFM; the Federal Board of
Medicine) is not available to others, we could not perform record linkage to identify who had
retired, emigrated or deceased. The National Registration of Specialists was expected to
provide easy access to an authoritative list of physicians in any medical specialty, but
unfortunately it has not been maintained as prescribed by the More Doctors Law.48
Consequently, the number of family and community physicians is surely overestimated, even
if we expect this overestimation to be minor, because family and community medicine is a
fairly young specialty in Brazil.44 In 2018, Augusto et al.23 (using the same methods as us)
estimated there would be 5.438 family and community physicians in Brazil, 276 (5%) more
than the 5.162 found by Scheffer et al.,44 who had access to CFM data. Another limitation of
our study was that, as in Augusto et al.,23 we could not include the family and community
physicians who completed their medical residencies in the 1970s. SisCNRM records for
family and community medicine (then community general medicine) begin at 1981, when the
specialty was recognized; we can only hope family and community physicians from the
1970s eventually took the exams and were certified after 2003.
Our data had limitations with regard to postgraduate programs, as well. Postgraduate
degrees will probably have been underreported to some extent, even though postgraduate
students are incentivized to have a CV in the Lattes Platform and entering data on a
postgraduate degree is simple enough. Furthermore, there surely was some information error
in the reported degrees, but we hope to have cleaned most of those errors during our

verification. One potential issue is that we verified the data using current information on the
postgraduate programs, not information from when the degrees were obtained; but much of
the information is not expected to change in any significant way, and possible changes in the
knowledge subarea or specialty of the postgraduate programs would not matter for our
analysis, which were done at the level of basic knowledge area. Finally, because the Lattes
Platform was launched in 1999, master’s and Ph.D. degrees earned before then are expected
to be underreported, even if this underreporting is expected to occur among those who don’t
make much use of the degrees.
In conclusion, family and community physicians increasingly earn academic and
professional master’s and Ph.D. degrees, with an emphasis on collective health, even though
women seemingly face barriers to advance their education. The consequences of different
postgraduate trajectories on professional performance and on primary health care research are
unknown. We suggest it would be easier to gain a wider view of postgraduate education of
primary health care professionals and/or on primary health care if the National Registration
of Specialists came back online, and if primary health care and/or family and community
medicine were recognized as knowledge areas.
