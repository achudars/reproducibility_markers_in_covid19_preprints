Abstract
Background: Though the unprecedented global effort at scaling up universal access to
antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased the progression of HIV, treatment failure (TF) among
pediatric patients receiving ART against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is becoming a
global public health concern which may impact on treatment outcome. Thus, the aim of this
study was to determine the rate and predictors of treatment failure (TF) among HIV-infected
pediatric patients taking ART in Ethiopia.
Methods: A prospective and retrospective follow-up study was conducted from March 2016 to
2017. Retrospective clinical and laboratory data were captured from patients’ medical record.
Socio-demographics and explanatory variables of participants were collected using pre-tested
structured questionnaire and study participants were followed for three to six month after
baseline viral load has been done to classify virologic failure (VF). TF was ascertained from
population who virally failed with the denominator of population taking ART. Chi-square test
and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to assess predictors TF. Statistical significance
was set at P-value less than 0.05.
Results: A total of 554 pediatrics patients taking ART from 40 selected health facilities were
included in the study. Viral load suppression (VLS) (VL<1000 copies/ml) among pediatric
population taking ART in Ethiopia were found to be 344 (62.1%). From those who was not
virally suppressed at baseline of the study 210 (37.9%), 99 (51.6%) were re-suppressed after

three to six month of enhanced adherence and counseling, leading the overall virologic failure
(VF) among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia to be 93 (17.3%). The mean CD4 count
was improved from 490 cells/ml at ART initiation to 921 cells/ml after 80 months of ART
exposure. Moreover, the clinical outcome was improved from 42% to 89% at ART initiation and
after 80 month of ART experience. CD4 count, clinical stage, Hemoglobin and weight were
found to be predictors of VF. Moreover; family HIV and disclosure status, duration on ART,
age, being orphan, stigma and medication adherence have significant association with VF.
Conclusions: The low level of VLS (62.1%) and the high level of VF (18.3%) could explain the
challenge on the national ART program among pediatric population. The significant
improvement on immunologic and clinical outcome could indicate the success of ART on
treatment outcome among pediatric population. CD4 count, clinical stage, Hemoglobin and
weight could be good predictors of TF among pediatric population. Improving disclosure status,
stigma and medication adherence could improve the treatment outcome of pediatric population
taking ART in Ethiopia.

Background
The global scaling up of treatment and care for people living with human immunodeficiency
virus (PLHIV) has led to a 43% decline in new HIV pediatric infections since 2003, with
330,000 newly infected children in 2011[1]. Despite efforts to expand access to antiretroviral
therapy (ART), only 28% of eligible children have received it [2]. Expansion of early HIV
diagnosis coverage, prompt ART initiation and better retention in care remain major goals [3],
[4], and the lack of laboratory monitoring frequently observed in low and middle-income
countries (LMIC) should not represent a barrier to ART distribution in children [2]–[6]. In
Ethiopia, the total number of pediatric population living with HIV in 2018 was estimated to be
56,514 of which 2,994 were new infections[7]. Very few pediatric patients among these are
started on ART regimens in Ethiopia.
Although virological failure is widely considered the criterion standard to detect treatment
failure, clinical and immunologic parameters are often the only criteria available in LMIC. CD4
cell monitoring has been shown to be a poor predictor of virological failure in treatment
experienced children, particularly when severely immune-compromised [8]–[13]. Studies in

LMIC have reported high rates of virological suppression in children up to 5-6 years after
treatment initiation; however, treatment failure rates of 10-34% were observed among children
after 2-3 years of ART [14]–[19].
Previous studies have also evaluated the patterns associated with switching from first line ART
regimes to second line ART regimes; however, studies that evaluate the rate and predictors
treatment failure in Ethiopia and Africa at large are scarce. Hence, this study reported rate of first
line ART treatment failure and predictors which will help to guide program experts and decision
makers working on the ART program and clinicians to evaluate patients on ART in every visit
for treatment failure and contributing factors. The study result can also be used as a baseline data
for subsequent studies.
Methods
Study design and population
A retrospective and prospective follow-up study was conducted across the nationally
representative health facilities (HFs) in Ethiopia. Baseline VL testing was done followed by
second round VL testing after three to six months of intensive adherence counseling for patients
with VL >1000 copies/ml at baseline to determine treatment failure (TF) as defined by WHO2013 [20]. Pre-established tools and questioner were also used to assess determinants of TF.
According to the WHO recommendation, selection of 40 HFs is sufficient for nationally
representative virologic failure (VF) [21], [22]. Magnitude of VF among pediatric HIV-1
infected patients in Gondar university hospitals in Ethiopia is reported as 18.2% [16]. A
confidence interval of half-width of ±5% has been used as appropriate compromise between
feasibility and precision with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Moreover, numbers of adults on
ART within the HF across each stratum by the end of 2014 have been independently considered
and calculated using the formula;
n = (Z2α/2× P (1-P))/e2
Where;
Z = value from standard normal distribution corresponding to desired confidence level (Z=1.96
for 95% CI)
P= Expected true proportion (0.182)
e= Desired precision (0.05)

Hence the assumed samples size was calculated to be 229. Considering the response rate of 85%,
laboratory failure rate 7% and design effect of 2, the required sample size was calculated to be
559.
Immunologic failure (IF), VF and clinical failure (CF) were considered to be dependent variables
whereas socio-demographic variables, duration on ART, variable related to patient social
behavior (disclosure, use of treatment assistant, use of memory aids, use of alternative medicine,
use of alcohol and substance abuse, missed appointments), knowledge and perception on HIV
and ART (knowledge and information on ART, Perception of treatment) and ART service
delivery environment (waiting time, distance to the clinic, quality of care, trust in health care,
providers, pill burden) were independent variables.

Data collection
Data were collected in two rounds, to classify the study population whether confirmed treatment
failure or not per the WHO classification [20]. Base line data were captured for the study
participants from March to August, 2016. Second-round data collection was specific for the
study participants with baseline viral load >1000 copies/ml since December, 2016 to March,
2017.
Types of data source
Primary data source: Pre-established questioner, used to capture data related with medication
adherence, knowledge, attitude and perception on ART, service delivery environment and other
demographic variables.
Secondary Data source: Secondary data were collected from the review of participants‘medical
record. These variables included medical history at three points; by the time the participant start
ART, the latest record prior to the data collection and record during the data collection. Some of
the key variables were CD4+ T-cell count, Clinical status per WHO classification, Medication
adherence history.
Blood sample collection: Five milliliter blood sample was collected from the study participants
during their attendance of the health facility for their appointment follow up. Plasma was
separated after centrifugation and transported according to the standard operating procedure for
sample collection, transport and tracking.
CD4+ T-cell count: CD4+ T-cell count was conducted at the health facility laboratory using
either BD FACS Count TM or BD FACS Calibour TM (Becton Dickinson, USA).

Viral load testing: VL testing was conducted at base-line of the study and repeated for the study
participants with baseline viral load >1000 copies/ml for the second round.
Viral load testing was conducted at the regional laboratories of the country using Abbott

and

COBAS®

AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taq Man® HIV-1 Test, v2.0.

Statistical analysis
The cumulative magnitude of VF was estimated from the proportion of children with VL>1000
copies/ml both at baseline and second round of the study. Similarly, magnitude of immunologic
and clinical failure were determined as per WHO definition [20].
Factors associated with VF was evaluated by comparing variables among adult who failed with
those who never failed using the chi-square test for categorical data, and using student-t test for
continuous variables. Logistic regression was done to determine the factors contributing to VF.
The model were then built by dropping the most insignificant factor one at a time with factors
whose P<0.05 were taken to be the factors that were independently associated with VF. All
analyses were done using SPSS version 20.

Result
Between March 2016 and 2017, 554 HIV-infected children less than 15 years old who were on
ART in 40 selected health facilities in Ethiopia were included in this study.
Characteristics of the study population: Demographically, 269 (48.6%) and 274 (51.4%) were
female and male respectively. Moreover, 489 (88.3%) and 57 (11.7%) were originally from
urban and rural respectively. More than half 325 (58.9%) of the study participants were above
the age of 120 months followed by 61-120 months accounted for 198 (35.9%). More than half of
the study participants 235 (57.6%) had at least 48 month of ART experience while 126 (30.9%)
and 47 (11.5%) had 15-47 and less than 15 months ART experience, respectively (Table-1).

Rate of treatment failure among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia: VLS among
pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia was 344 (62.1%). Study participants whose viral
load >1000 copies/ml (N=210) were followed for three to six month with adherence counseling.
With 18 (8.5%) dropout, 99 (51.6%) were re-suppressed and the remaining 93 (48.4%) of those
who were virally not suppressed at baseline were not re-suppressed and classified as confirmed
VF. Hence, the overall VF among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia was found to be
93 (17.34%) (Table-2). Participants at clinical stage I were significantly improved from 26% at
ART initiation to 73% after average 39 months of ART experience. Clinical outcome was
improved from 42% to 89% at ART initiation and after 80 month of ART experience. Moreover,

Predictors of pediatric treatment failure among population taking ART in Ethiopia:
This study revealed that, there is significant association between VLS with maternal HIV status,
being orphanage, duration on treatment, CD4 count at ART initiation and residency (P=0.046,
0.049, 0.001, 0.001 and 0.032) (Table-3). Living with mother or father was found to be
preventive for viral suppression (AOR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.248-4.47). Similarly, Early stage ART
experience was also found to be a risk for VLS (AOR: 1.86, 95% CI: 0.42-3.31). CD4 count and
WHO clinical stage were also predictors for treatment failure (Table-4). The mean level of Hgb
was improved from 15.21 at ART initiation to 18.68 after 80 months of ART experience.
Moreover, the mean CD4 count and weight was improved from 490.52 and 18.33 at ART
initiation to 920.70 and 31.53 after 80 months of ART ignition, respectively (Figure-1).

Discussion
From this study, VLS among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia were found to be 344
(62.1%). Of those who was not virally suppressed at baseline of the study 210 (37.9%); 99
(51.6%) were re-suppressed after three to six month of enhanced adherence and counseling,
leading VF among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia to be 93 (17.32%). This finding
is consistent with a study conducted in Tanzania which revealed viral suppression as 68.4% [10].
However, this contradicts with other study conducted at Rohde Island which showed 43% viral
suppression among pediatric population[14]. This study revealed that pediatric TF is a
programmatic concern since there is significant difference with VLS among pediatric versus
adult in Ethiopia which was reported as 88.1%[23]. Immunologic failure at base line of this
study was 185 (33.3%) at ART initiation and improved to 39 (7%) after 80 month of ART
experience. This contradicted with a study conducted at University of Gondar which revealed
magnitude of IF at ART initiation be 10%[12]. From retrospective cohort study done in Nigeria
the rate of first line regimen failure was 18.8%[26].
In this study, Immunologic failure was found to be 33.3% at base line of ART initiation while
the majority of (67.7%) were at stage clinical stage II/III at baseline of ART iniation which has
been significantly improved after 80 month of ART initation. This contradicted with a
retrospective cohort study done at Jimma University Specialized hospital, among children on
first line ART, clinical treatment failure and immunologic treatment failure were diagnosed in
6.2% and 11.5% respectively[27]. From the retrospective cohort study conducted in Addis
Ababa, there were 14.1% children with HIV/AIDS who had evidence of first line ART failure of
which 5.9% had clinical treatment failure, 6.7% immunologic failure and 1.5% developed both
immunologic and clinical failure [12]. From all studies above the prevalence of the ART
treatment failure was not-comparable except that of Ugandan study which was higher and
explained by the nature of study being case control with possible risk factors. From study
conducted at Addis Ababa, out of all children with first line ART failure, only 24 (14.4%) were
identified. The mean time of detection of treatment failure was 19.7 months (SD = 14 months)
and the mean time to switch to second line ART regimen, for those switched, was 24 months
[12].
The detection rate was higher in the current study which can be due to the high prevalence of
treatment failure and the increased awareness for treatment failure as time goes. In this study

duration of ART (p=0.049) was independent factor that increase the risk of ART treatment
failure. Similar to the study conducted in Medical College and Research Institute of Bangalore,
duration on ART for more than 3 years (P=0.0436) was associated with immunological
failure[28]. In multiple regression, duration on ART, age and CD4 count (lowest ever) on
treatment were predictors of immunological failure in these patients[28]. As it can be seen from
these studies the chance of ART treatment failure was increasing as duration of ART increases
which is consistent with this study. This study also showed that base line CD4 less than 250
cells/µl (p<0.001) were independent factors for ART treatment failure. In Medical College and
Research Institute of Bangalore, low CD4 counts (<100cells/μl) at start of ART (P=0.0261), less
than 50% gain in CD4 count (P=0.048) after one year of start of ART and duration on ART for
more than 3 years (P=0.0436) were associated with immunological failure[28]. In multiple
regression, duration on ART, age and CD4 count (lowest ever) on treatment were predictors of
immunological failure in these patients [16]. From the studies conducted in Nigeria and
Cambodia risk factors for ART treatment failure were ARV exposure and sever
immunosuppression before start of ART [26]. From a study conducted in Kenya, the factors were
base line CD4 below 50 cells [29]. From these studies, the risk factors including low base line
CD4 and poor adherence were found to be significant associated factors for ART treatment
failure.
In this study, it is revealed that being orphan (P=0.049) and residency (P=0.032) was found to be
associated with treatment failure. Children who born from HIV positive families with families
alive was preventive for treatment failure (AOR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.24-4.77) and moreover,
disclosure of HIV status was found to be preventive (AOR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.35-3.29).
Conclusion
The overall first line ART treatment failure was 18.2% (41patients) in which the most common
type is both clinical and immunological (8.9%) followed by immunological failure (6.2%),
clinical failure alone accounts for 3.1%. Out of all children who have evidence for first line ART
treatment failure, only 14 (34%) patients were detected and started on second line regimens. But
about 37(66%) patients were not detected even though they have evidence of treatment failure
during follow up. So close monitoring should be done to detect treatment failure early and shift
to second line treatment. ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT, advanced clinical stages (3 and 4), base
line CD4 less than 200 cells/µl, tuberculosis co-infection, substitution of original regimen once

or more for any reason, poor adherence during follow up and duration of ART above 60 months
were independent factors that increase the risk of first line ART treatment failure. So this group
of patients should be strictly evaluated for treatment failure at every visit since these factors
increase the risk of first line ART treatment failure. Service providers should strengthen
adherence counseling at every visit since it is a risk factor for treatment failure. Since there are
many patients with first line ART treatment failure, second line drugs for children should be
available. The trend of shifting to second line treatment and the mean delay from detection of
treatment failure and start of second line treatment was not determined in this study and can be
studied in subsequent studies.
