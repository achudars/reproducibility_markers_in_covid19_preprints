Abstract

19

Rare variants play an essential role in the etiology of cancer and characterizing rare germline

20

variants that impact the risk of cancer is an ongoing challenge. We performed a genome-wide

21

rare variant analysis using germline whole exome sequencing (WES) data derived from the

22

Geisinger MyCode initiative to discover cancer predisposition variants. The case-control

23

association analysis was conducted by binning pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in

24

5,538 cancer patients and 7,286 matched controls in a discovery set and 1,991 cancer patients

25

and 2,504 matched controls in a validation set across nine cancer types. We discovered 87

26

genes and 106 pathways significantly associated with cancer (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05) out

27

of which seven genes and 26 pathways replicated from the validation set (suggestive threshold

28

P < 0.05). Further, four genes and 21 pathways were discovered to be associated with multiple

29

cancers (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05). Additionally, we identified 13 genes and two pathways

30

associated with survival outcome across seven cancers (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05), where

two genes, PCDHB8 and DCHS2, were also associated with survival outcome in TCGA data. In

32

summary, we conducted one of the largest pan-cancer association studies using germline data

33

derived from a single hospital system to find novel predisposition genes and pathways

34

associated with nine cancers. Our results can inform future guidelines for germline genetic

35

testing in cancer, which will be helpful in screening for cancer high-risk patients. This work adds

to the knowledge base and progress being made in precision medicine.

Introduction

40

Cancer is the second most lethal disease in United States with an estimated 1,735,350 new

41

cases and 609,640 deaths in 20181. Cancer is caused by inherited germline variants and

42

acquired somatic mutations. A recent twin study showed ~33% heritability of cancer across 23

43

cancer types with a high estimate of 57% for prostate (MIM: 176807), 31% for breast (MIM:

44

114480), 38% for kidney (MIM: 144700), and 58% for skin melanoma (MIM: 155600)2. Germline

45

genetic markers for cancers have been widely studied leading to the discovery of many

46

heritable predisposition genes such as BRCA1 (MIM: 113705), BRCA2 (MIM: 600185) and PALB2

47

(MIM: 610355) in breast cancer, RB1 (MIM: 614041) in retinoblastoma and MLH1 (MIM:

48

120436), MSH2 (MIM: 609309), MSH6 (MIM: 600678), and PMS2 (MIM: 600259) in Lynch

49

syndrome (MIM: 120435). To date, many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been

50

conducted and many more variants and genes have been discovered as associated with various

51

cancer types3-8. However, a large portion of inherited genetic factors that result in

52

carcinogenesis is still unknown and many studies are being undertaken to discover these

53

genetic variants. For instance, the genetic contribution explained by all variants discovered to

54

date is about 39% in prostate cancer2; 9 and 30% in breast cancer2; 10.

55
56

Since common variants discovered to be associated with multiple cancers have only modest

57

effect size, the missing heritability could be further explained by rare variants. Moreover, rare

58

variants have been known to contribute to various complex diseases including cancer11-13. The

59

aggregation of rare variants in a gene can lead to loss of function of the gene or change in

60

expression14. Similarly, since pathways perform a sequence of biochemical actions leading to a

61

cellular function or product, changes in the expression of genes involved within a pathway can

62

lead to cancer15; 16. Previous studies have also indicated that cancer is caused by an

63

accumulation of a number of singular or rare variants in particular genes or pathways12. To that

64

effect, binning the pathogenic and likely pathogenic rare variants into genes and pathways

65

would help us increase statistical power to detect associations and also infer biological

66

mechanisms13; 17; 18.

67
68

The MyCode community initiative is a precision medicine project, launched at Geisinger in

69

2007, which enabled the storage of blood, serum, and DNA samples in a system-wide

70

biorepository that is available for use in broad research19. To date, over 244,000 patients have

71

signed up for the MyCode initiative and over 90,000 patient blood samples have been

72

sequenced as part of the DiscovEHR project in collaboration with the Regeneron Genetics

73

Center20. The sequenced data can be easily linked to the electronic health record (EHR) of the

74

patient, allowing access to rich longitudinal data. Apart from the EHR, Geisinger also maintains

75

a cancer registry that contains all the patients diagnosed or treated for cancer at any Geisinger

76

medical facility. Further, as part of the MyCode program, the genetic data is also being used to

77

detect increased risk of developing one or more of 21 medically actionable conditions, including

78

breast cancer, ovarian cancer (MIM: 167000), Marfan syndrome (MIM: 154700), Lynch

79

syndrome, etc., and the results are returned to the patients though a “Return of Results”

80

program21. Moreover, many similar programs around the world are helping to integrate

81

genomics into clinical practice22. Manolio et al. emphasize that the integration of genomic

82

findings to clinical practice has been relatively slow and insist on the need to have an openly

83

accessible knowledge base of variants, phenotypes and clinically actionable variants23. The

84

sharing of genetic findings is likely to help the scientific research community to improve our

85

understanding of the phenotype of interest and propel precision medicine by bringing more

86

genomics into clinical practice.

87
88

In summary, we conducted one of the largest pan-cancer association studies using germline

89

data from a single hospital system to find novel genes and pathways associated with nine

90

cancers. Our study also validates several genes and pathways that have already been implicated

91

in other genome-wide association studies. We identified 87 genes that were significant across

92

cancers, of which seven were replicated in an independent dataset and four genes were shared

93

among multiple cancers. We also identified 106 pathways that reached genome-wide

94

significance, of which 26 pathways were replicated. Further, 21 pathways were significant

95

across multiple cancers. In addition to the genes and pathways associated with cancer risk, we

96

also identified 13 genes and two pathways associated with survival outcome across cancers.

Study design and population characteristics

101
102

This study was based on a subset of 7,449 cancer cases and 9,792 controls selected by matching

103

age, BMI and gender from ~90,000 sequenced samples from the DiscovEHR study. The samples

104

were sequenced in two phases using different platforms as described in the Methods section. In

105

phase 1, 60,000 samples were sequenced, and 5,538 cancer patients across nine cancers and

106

7,286 matched controls were pulled. In phase 2, 30,000 samples were sequenced which

107

included 1,991 cancer patients and 2,504 matched controls. Consequently, the phase 2 dataset

108

was used to replicate results from phase 1. Cancer patient IDs that were retrieved from the

109

cancer registry were classified into particular cancers using International Classification of

110

Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) codes. After classifying the cancer patients to their respective

111

cancers, only nine cancers, including bladder (MIM: 109800), breast, colorectal (MIM: 114500),

112

kidney, lung (MIM: 211980), melanoma, prostate, thyroid (MIM: 188550), and uterine cancer,

113

had more than 300 samples in the discovery set. A low number of samples in association

114

studies results in a higher type 1 error rate and lower statistical power to detect associations24.

115

Thus, the rest of the cancers were excluded from this study. The distribution and basic

116

demographics of patients across these cancers are shown in Table 1. A common set of controls

117

were used for all the cancers except breast, uterine and prostate cancer as they are sex-specific

118

cancers. The sex-matched controls were separately pulled to match the same number of

119

controls across all cancers.

120
121

Table 1 provides age, BMI, female ratio, and vital status (alive or deceased) information across

122

cancers. Among all cancers, breast cancer had the largest number of cases (N = 1,214) followed

123

by prostate cancer (N = 1,146). Further, uterine cancer had a significantly higher average BMI as

124

compared to other cancers. The average BMI for uterine cancer patients was 38.33 kg/m2 in the

125

discovery dataset and 36.76 kg/m2 in the replication dataset. Additionally, lung cancer had the

126

highest number of cases who are deceased, which is expected as lung cancer is by far the

127

leading cause of death due to cancer1. Further, observing the female ratio across the cancers

128

also shows a gender disparity in some cancers. Specifically, the incidence rate in bladder cancer

129

was found to be 4.46 fold higher in male than female, and in thyroid cancer it was 3.95 fold

130

higher in female than male. The difference in incidence rates have been well documented in

131

other studies with a 3-4 times increased risk of bladder cancer risk in men25 and 2.9 times

132

increased risk of thyroid cancer in women26.

133
134

Variant filtering based on functional annotation and scores improves power and has been

135

successfully used in many association studies14; 27. In this study, the variants from whole exome

136

sequence data were annotated using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)28 and ClinVar29.

137

Subsequently, only the variants categorized as pathogenic and likely-pathogenic based on the

138

annotations were retained for further analysis. A strategy for classifying variants as pathogenic

139

and likely pathogenic is elaborated in the Methods section. Additionally, all common variants

140

were removed, and only rare variants (MAF < 0.05) were retained. The number of variants

141

available after filtering out for each cancer cohort is listed in Table S1.

142
143

Pathway-based rare variant analysis

144
145

Association analysis using rare variants usually suffers from a lack of power as very large

146

datasets are required. Therefore, rare variants are often binned into a biologically informed-

147

unit such as a gene or pathway to improve the power17. In this study, pathogenic and likely

148

pathogenic rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.05 were binned into genes

149

followed by KEGG pathways using BioBin17; 30; 31. Next, an association test was performed to

150

determine if the gene/pathway is significantly associated with the phonotype. SKAT-O is an

151

optimal unified approach that combines a burden and non-burden sequence kernel association

152

test (SKAT) test, and maintains power regardless of the direction of effect and causality of the

153

variants32. After determining the association p-values, they were adjusted for multiple testing in

154

each cancer type separately using a Bonferroni correction. Any genes/pathways with a

155

Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05 were considered as significant results. The same procedure was

156

followed to conduct rare variant analysis in discovery and replication datasets. Figure 2 shows

157

all the pathways that were Bonferroni significant across all cancers and the same are listed in

158

Table S4-S6.

159
160

In total, 106 pathways were found to be significantly associated across all cancers (Figure 2).

161

However, no significant pathways were found in prostate cancer. Further, 26 pathways: 12 in

162

bladder cancer, five in colorectal cancer, five in kidney cancer, two in lung cancer and two in

163

thyroid cancer, marked in red in Figure 2, were replicated from the replication dataset (SKAT-O

164

P < 0.05). More information regarding the 26 pathways including locus count, minor allele

165

count (MAC) in cases, MAC in controls, SKAT-O p-value and Bonferroni-corrected p-value in

166

discovery and replication datasets can be found in Table 2. Additionally, 21 pathways were

167

found to be significantly associated in more than one cancer, with the FoxO signaling pathway

168

and GnRH signaling pathway significantly associated with four cancers, followed by apoptosis

169

and bladder cancer significantly associated with three cancers and the rest of the 17 pathways

170

significantly associated with two cancers (Table 3).

171
172

Gene-based rare variant analysis

173
174

All pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants below MAF < 0.05 were binned into gene

175

boundaries defined by Entrez annotations derived from Library of Knowledge Integration (LOKI)

176

using BioBin17; 30. The total number of genes that the variants were binned across all cancers is

177

listed in Table S2. The bar plot in Figure 3 shows the total number of loci binned for a given

178

gene and variant types as annotated by VEP. In total, there were 87 genes that were

179

significantly associated with a specific cancer (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05) (Figure 3).

180

Furthermore, seven genes - MLNR (MIM: 602885), CPAMD8 (MIM: 608841), CHRNE (MIM:

181

100725), HOXB13 (MIM: 604607), SCML4 (HGNC: 256380), BST1 (MIM: 600387) and TMEM186

182

(HGNC: 25880), marked in red in Figure 3, were replicated in the phase 2 dataset (P < 0.05)

183

(Table 4).

184
185

Additionally, four genes, including MAPK12 (MIM: 602399), ECE2 (MIM: 610145), DNMT3A

186

(MIM: 602769) and CHIA (MIM: 606080), were significantly associated in multiple cancers. The

187

gene MAPK12 was significantly associated with bladder cancer and colorectal cancer, ECE2 and

188

CHIA for melanoma and colorectal cancer, and DNMT3A for bladder and lung cancer. Further

189

association test statistics on these genes are described in Table 5. The PhenoGram33 plot in

190

Figure 4 shows all the genes found to be significantly associated across all cancers. Additionally,

191

the lollipop34 plots in Figure 5 and Figure S1 shows the type of variants – frameshift, missense,

192

stop gained, stop lost, splice acceptor, splice donor, start lost, and their relative position in the

193

gene. Variants that were found in the Catalog of Somatic Mutation in Cancer (COSMIC)

194

database were marked with COSMIC ids. The nonsense stop gained variants marked in yellow

195

usually results in a truncated protein, which are non-functional and the frameshift variants

196

marked in red usually cause a loss of function due to a shift in the reading frame.

200

Previously, Huang et al.14 identified potential genes in cancers with a higher enrichment of

201

pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)

202

non-TCGA cohort from a curated list of genes that contribute to cancer susceptibility. They

203

identified 28 cancer gene associations (FDR < 0.05) and 16 suggestive associations (FDR < 0.15)

204

by conducting total frequency test (TFT)14 on germline data across 33 cancers. We wanted to

205

see if any of these genes also had higher mutational germline burden in our study as it would

206

help validate cancer susceptibility genes and even discover new gene associations that were

207

not statistically significant in Huang et al. As such, the list of gene-cancer pairs were filtered to

208

the nine cancer types under consideration in this study and TFT was run on the genes to

209

validate the enrichment of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in cancer patients against

210

control group. Seven genes – ATM (lung, MIM: 607585), CHECK2 (breast, HGNC: 11200), MSH2

211

(colorectal), BRCA2 (thyroid), POLE (kidney, MIM: 174762), PALB2 (breast), MLH1 (colorectal)

212

were found to be significant at a TFT p-value < 0.05. Moreover, two of the genes – ATM (lung)

213

and BRCA2 (thyroid) found to be previously significant 14 were replicated in this study. Further,

214

three genes – ATM (lung), CHECK2 (breast) and MSH2 (colorectal) were significant at FDR <

215

0.15. The carrier frequency of these genes and distribution of pathogenic and likely pathogenic

216

variants across oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is shown in Figure 6 (Table S8). In

217

summary, we were able to validate two genes (TFT p-value < 0.05) and we discovered two more

218

genes with a suggestive association (FDR < 0.15).

219
220

Survival analysis

221
222

In this study, we also sought to discover variants that have an impact on the survival of

223

patients. To this aim, a weighed burden matrix was used to run cox regression adjusting for age

224

and BMI as covariates. The cox p-values were further adjusted using a Bonferroni correction

225

separately on each cancer type to account for multiple testing. Thirteen genes and two

226

pathways across seven cancers were found to be significantly associated with survival at

227

Bonferroni < 0.05. Further, to confirm that the p-values were not a random effect, permutation

228

testing was conducted by randomly shuffling the weighed burden values among patients and

229

running cox regression 100,000 times. We observed considerably less significant permutation p-

230

values across all genes and pathways. The permutation p-values and other statistics are listed in

231

Table 6 for significant genes and Table 7 for significant pathways. All the Kaplan-Meier survival

232

curves are shown in Figure S2. The genes that were significantly associated were further tested

233

for association with survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provisional data on the cBio

234

Cancer Genomics Portal (http://cbioportal.org)35.The two groups were formed using somatic

235

mutations and mRNA expression (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) using a z-score threshold ± 2. Two genes

236

PCDHB8 (Logrank P = 9.22E-03, MIM: 606334) and DCHS2 (Logrank P = 0.036, MIM: 612486)

237

were significant at a Logrank P < 0.05.

Discussion

240
241

In this study, we present results from a rare variant analysis conducted across nine cancers

242

using a cohort of 7,449 cancer cases and 9,792 controls from a single hospital system using

243

whole exome sequencing data and clinical data from a patient EHR. A total of 133 pathways (26

244

replicated) and 91 genes (7 replicated) were identified as associated with cancers. Furthermore,

245

21 pathways and four genes were associated with multiple cancer types. Additionally, we

246

identified 13 genes and two pathways as associated with survival across multiple cancers.

247
248

Many KEGG pathways identified in this study have already been implicated in cancer, such as

249

“pathways in cancer”, “GnRH signaling pathway” 36, “bladder cancer”, “FoxO signaling pathway”

, “metabolic pathways”, “gap junction” 38, “apoptosis”, “base excision repair”, “melanoma”,

251

“choline metabolism in cancer” and “basal cell carcinoma”. One pathway of interest that is

252

associated with bladder cancer is the “insulin secretion pathway”. Previous studies have shown

253

diabetes mellitus increases the risk of bladder cancer39 and is possibly due to administration of

254

the anti-diabetic drug Pioglitazone40. Another pathway “HTLV-I infection” was found to be

255

associated with kidney cancer and was also replicated. HTLV-I is a known oncovirus that causes

256

cancer41. Further studies on the “HTLV-I infection" pathway could elucidate the role of germline

257

variants in cancers. Another pathway “Legionellosis” was found to be associated with kidney

258

and bladder cancer, Legionella pneumonia in cancer has a very high mortality rate ~31%42, and

259

variants in pathway could play a role in susceptibility or recovery of the patients. Another

260

pathway, the “Hippo signaling pathway” was found to be associated with uterine cancer. The

261

“Hippo tumor suppressor pathway” is known to phosphorylate YAP and TAZ which are critical

262

for cell growth, reprogramming and development43. The Hippo pathway also interacts with the

263

PI3K/AKT pathway which is commonly involved in cancer43. Additionally, Hippo pathway is

264

known to affect the survival of cancer patients44 and in this study, one of the genes DCHS2,

265

which is part of Hippo pathway, was also associated with survival in uterine cancer and it was

266

also replicated in the TCGA data.

267
268

A number of previous studies have shown HOXB13 to be associated with prostate cancer45-48,

269

and in this study as well, HOXB13 was found to be associated with prostate cancer in the

270

discovery dataset and was replicated. Another gene, CPAMD8, which is involved in broad-

271

spectrum protease inhibition, innate immunity and damage control was found to be associated

272

with kidney cancer in the discovery and replication datasets49. CPAMD8 is known to be

273

substantially expressed in kidney49; 50 and given its functional role, rare gene-disruptive variants

274

in CPAMD8 could lead to carcinogenesis. We also identified two genes associated with uterine

275

cancer that replicated - CHRNE which is a subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)

276

and TMEM186 which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. Nicotine, a compound

277

present in cigarettes, mediates cell proliferation and angiogenesis though nicotinic

278

acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and its subunits51. Still, its mechanism of action is not well

279

understood for uterine cancer where some studies have shown smoking to reduce the risk of

280

uterine cancer contrary to other cancers51; 52. Again, the exact role of TMEM186 in uterine

281

cancer is also unexplored. TMEMs are differentially regulated in many types of cancers and

282

some TMEMs are known to act as tumor suppressors while others as oncogenes53. Further, in

283

bladder cancer, the Putative Polycomb group (PcG) protein gene (SCML4), is involved in the

284

regulation of crucial developmental and physiological processes and is known to promote

285

proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. SCML4 was replicated in bladder cancer54.

286
287

Different cancer types share some pathways and genes, which generally include common

288

tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes14. In this study, we identified 21 pathways and four

289

genes that were associated with multiple cancers. Two of the genes MAPK12 and DNMT3A are

290

well known genes involved in cancer with MAPK12 acting as p38 MAPK, which is involved in cell

291

differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy, whereas DNMT3A is involved in DNA methylation and

292

its disruption leads to tumorigenesis55; 56. Gene ECE2 cleaves endothelin-1 (ET-1) which is a

293

potent vasoconstrictor peptide and ET-1 is known to be involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis and

294

growth in colorectal cancer and melanoma57. Elevated levels of plasma levels and increased

295

immunopositivity of ET-1 has been observed in colorectal cancer57.

296
297

We also discovered 13 genes that are associated with survival in cancers. The presence of rare

298

pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants reduced the overall survival rate for all the genes

299

identified across cancers. Some of the genes discovered were already known to be associated

300

with survival in cancers and a subset of them have also been suggested as a target for cancer

301

therapy like SAXO2 (HGNC: 283726) which is involved in microtubule binding in uterine

302

cancer58, PCDHB8 whose downregulation is known to result in poor prognosis in bladder

303

cancer59 , ATXN3 (MIM: 607047) whose downregulation increases expression of tumor

304

suppressor PTEN (MIM: 601728)60, and TPTE2 (MIM: 606791) , a homolog of PTEN, whose

305

upregulation suppresses metastasis and/or tumorigenesis61. Other genes were associated with

306

survival in this study - ANO5 (MIM: 608662) is known to regulate cell migration and invasion62,

307

the HOGA1 (MIM: 613597) gene is involved in metabolism, CSH2 (MIM: 118820) is involved in

308

postnatal and intrauterine growth63 and HLA-G (MIM: 142871) offers an immune escape

309

mechanism as it is involved in cytokine signaling in the immune system and class I MHC

310

mediated antigen processing and presentation64. Thus, disruption of the normal activity of

311

these genes could promote cancer. Another gene NAA38 (MIM: 617990)which was associated

312

with survival in thyroid has been shown to be associated with survival in glioblastoma (MIM:

313

137800)65. Furthermore, two genes PCDHB8 and DCHS2 were significantly associated with

314

survival in the TCGA provisional dataset.

316

Even though many associations were identified in this study, further studies would be required

317

to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. A shortcoming of this study was that the replication

318

cohort was underpowered to replicate all the findings. Additionally, the participants in the

319

replication cohort were derived from participants who enrolled into the MyCode program more

320

recently than the discovery dataset. Therefore, most of the patients in the replication set were

321

alive and it was not practical to run survival analysis using the replication dataset. The

322

limitations imposed by the sample size and power would be addressed in the future as the

323

MyCode and DiscovEHR programs are still ongoing and more samples are being sequenced.

324

Another limitation of our study is that our population predominantly consists of European

325

ancestry, mainly due to the patient population at Geisinger which is predominantly of European

326

ancestry.

327
328

In conclusion, this study conducted genome-wide rare-variant analysis to find novel genes and

329

pathways associated across nine cancers. We also replicated many genes and pathways that are

330

very well known in cancers, which further emphasizes the fact that some portion of the missing

331

heritability is attributed to rare variants. We also identified some genes associated with the

332

survival of the patients which have already been suggested as targets in cancer therapy. We

333

also discovered novel genes and pathways associated with survival of patients which could be

334

potential targets for cancer therapy. The genes and pathways discovered in this study can be

335

used to screen for high-risk cancer patients and personalized therapy. In summary, results from

336

this study could help define a portion of the missing heritability associated with cancer and

337

have broad applications in precision medicine.

Methods

340
341

Study population

342

The study population consisted of Geisinger patients who consented to participate in the

343

MyCode community initiative. As part of MyCode initiative, individuals agreed to provide blood

344

and DNA samples for broad, future research, including genomic analyses as part of the

345

Regeneron-Geisinger DiscovEHR collaboration and linking to data in the Geisinger EHR under a

346

protocol approved by the Geisinger Institutional Review Board. The cases were a subset of

347

cancer patients from a cancer registry that were part of 90,000 patients sequenced as part of

348

the DiscovEHR project. The cases were classified into different cancers using ICD-O site codes as

349

defined in Table S3. Cases that were recorded as having cancer in multiple primary sites were

350

removed. Further, only cancers with at least 300 cases in 60,000 patients were sequenced in

351

phase 1 of the DiscovEHR study were included and other cancers were discarded due to a low

352

number of cases. A common control set was selected for all non-sex specific cancers using

353

matched age and BMI to cases from a pool of patients who did not have any ICD9/ICD10 code

354

related to cancer in a problem-list entry of the diagnosis code, an inpatient hospitalization-

355

discharge diagnosis code, or an encounter diagnosis code. The controls for breast, uterine and

356

prostate cancer were pulled separately to have the same number of controls as the common

357

control set. Age was calculated as age at diagnosis for cases and current age if alive or age at

358

death for controls. The median of BMI values recorded in the EHR from a year before diagnosis

359

date was used as BMI for cases. Furthermore, the median of BMI values from a year before

360

current date or date of death for alive and deceased patients respectively was used as BMI for

361

controls.

362
363

Sequencing and quality control

364

All the study population was sequenced as part of the DiscovEHR project at the Regeneron

365

Genetic Center. Initially, around 60,000 samples were sequenced using NimbleGen probe

366

target-capture (SeqCap VCRome) and further a separate batch of 30,000 samples were

367

sequenced using xGen capture (Integrated DNA Technologies) followed by sequencing on the

368

Illumina HiSeq 2500. The variant calling was done using GATK66; 67. Further detailed description

369

of sequencing is available at Shivakumar et al.13 and Mirshahi et al.68. Additional call rate quality

370

controls were applied. The markers and samples with a call rate below 90% were filtered out.

371

All related patients showing up to 3rd degree relatedness corresponding to IBD > 0.125 were

372

removed.

373
374

Variant annotation and filtering

375
376

All variants were annotated using VEP and ClinVar. All the loci that satisfied the following two

377

conditions were retained and the rest were filtered out.

378

1. Loci that were annotated with impact ‘HIGH’ using VEP.

379

2. Loci that were annotated as pathogenic and likely pathogenic with at least 1 star using

380

ClinVar.

381

Variants that satisfied the conditions were considered pathogenic and likely pathogenic and all

382

analysis were run using only these loci.

383
384

Gene based rare variant association

385
386

All the variants that were annotated as pathogenic and likely pathogenic were binned using

387

BioBin17; 30. BioBin uses pre-compiled knowledge in a LOKI database, which is compiled using

388

information from various data sources including Entrez and KEGG. The variants were binned

389

into genes using Entrez annotations. Only variants with MAF < 0.05 were considered rare and

390

the rest of the variants were filtered out. Additionally, bins with less than 20 variants (MAC)

391

were filtered out due to low sample size. Further, the binned variants were weighed using

392

Madsen-browning weights69. The statistical association tests were run using SKAT-O

393

implemented as R package32. Additionally, the association tests were adjusted using age, BMI

394

and first four principle components as covariates. The principle components were calculated

395

using EIGENSOFT70, using common variants after LD pruning with indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5 and

396

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of 10-6. The association test p-values were further adjusted using

397

Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing correction.

398
399

Pathway based rare variant association

400

BioBin was used to bin rare variants with a MAF < 0.05 into KEGG pathways derived from

401

LOKI17; 30. Any pathway bin that did not contain a total of at least 20 variants across case and

402

cancer were filtered out due to small sample size. Further all the bins were weighted using

403

Madsen-browning weighting69. Statistical association was run using SKAT-O implemented as R

404

package 32. The association tests were adjusted using age, BMI and four principle components

405

as covariates. Further, the association p-values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction.

406
407

Survival analysis

408
409

Survival analysis was run using cox regression adjusting for age and BMI. Specifically, the BioBin

410

bin-phe output files which contains a weighted burden of variants were used to get the

411

weighted burden of each patient for the bin (gene/pathway) and cox regression was run on the

412

bin adjusting for age and BMI. Survival analysis was performed on each cancer using gene-

413

based bins and pathway-based bins. Further, survival p-values were adjusted for multiple

414

testing using Bonferroni correction.
