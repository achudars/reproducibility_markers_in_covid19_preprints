Abstract

52

Background: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), devastating complications of diabetes mellitus, is a

53

major public health problem, and one of the leading reasons for hospital admission, amputations,

54

and even death among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. Despite its catastrophic health consequences,

55

the national burden of diabetic foot ulcer remains unknown in Ethiopia. Hence, the objective of

56

this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the national prevalence of diabetic foot

57

ulcer and investigate the association with duration of illness and patient residence among

58

diabetic patients.

59

Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, and

60

PsycINFO databases for studies of diabetic foot ulcers prevalence that published from

61

conception up to June 30, 2019. Quality of each article was assessed using a modified version of

62

the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies. All statistical analyses were done using

63

STATA version 14 software for Windows, and meta-analysis was carried out using a random-

64

effects method. The pooled national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers was presented using a

65

forest plot.

66

Results: A total of 10 studies with 3,029 diabetic patients were included. The pooled national

67

prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers among Ethiopian diabetic patients was 11.27% (95% CI 7.22,

68

15.31%, I2=94.6). Duration of illness (OR: 3.91, 95%CI 2.03, 7.52, I2=63.4%) and patients’

69

residence (OR: 3.40, 95%CI 2.09, 5.54, I2=0.0%) were significantly associated with a diabetic

70

foot ulcer.

71

Conclusion: In Ethiopia, at least one out of ten diabetic patients had diabetic foot ulcers.

72

Healthcare policymakers (FMoH) need to improve the standard of diabetic care and should

73

design effective preventive strategies to improve health care delivery for people with diabetes

74

and reduce the risk of foot ulceration.

Background

77

Diabetes is a chronic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia that occurs either due to insulin

78

deficiency or resistance[1, 2] that has been increasing rapidly worldwide. According to the

79

American Diabetes Association 2014 report, the global prevalence of diabetes among adults is

80

8.5%[2, 3]. In Africa, an estimated 12.1 million people were living with diabetes in 2010, and

81

this figure is more likely to be 23.9 million by 2030[4].

82

Diabetes has several acute and chronic complications including diabetic foot ulceration. A

83

diabetic foot, which is the formation of foot ulceration that manifested by neuropathy, ischemia,

84

and infection, is one of the major public health problems affecting diabetic patients throughout

85

the world[5, 6]. About 10% to 15% of diabetes patients are at risk of developing a foot ulcer

86

during their lifetime[7]. The annual population-based incidence of diabetic foot ulceration ranges

87

from 1.0% to 4.1%, and its prevalence among diabetic patients ranges from 4% to 10%[5, 8].

88

Diabetes foot problems are responsible for high morbidity and mortality of diabetes in Africa. In

89

sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of a diabetic foot ulcer is increasing due to late diagnosis, poor

90

awareness among patients, and poor access to diabetic care[9, 10]. The presence of foot ulcers in

91

diabetes patient increases the risk of lower extremity amputations, worsens the physical,

92

psychological, and social quality of life[11-13]. Furthermore, patients living with diabetic foot

93

ulcers(DFUs) has a great economic burden and poor health-related quality of life[14].

94

Diabetic foot ulceration has been associated with various risk factors, such as longer duration of

95

diabetes mellitus (DM), residence, lack of awareness, poor foot care practice, poor glycemic

96

control, poor hygienic condition, foot trauma, peripheral neuropathy and presence of vascular

97

diseases[15-17] [8] [18] [19]. Interestingly, most of the risk factors can be prevented easily with

98

health education, careful foot care, and glycemic control[20].

99

Despite the huge burden of diabetic foot ulceration and it is one of the challenging health

100

concerns in Ethiopia, the overall prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer among diabetic patients at the

101

national level remains unknown. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review and meta-

102

analysis was to estimate the national prevalence of foot ulcers among diabetic patients and

103

investigate the association with duration of illness and residence in Ethiopia. The findings of this

104

study will be important to provide valuable information regarding the burden of the diabetic foot

105

and to inform healthcare policymakers for areas of improvement in diabetic care in Ethiopia.

106

Methods

107

Search strategy and selection criteria

108

This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting

109

Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline[21]. We searched

110

articles reporting the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers among diabetic patients from PubMed,

111

Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases using the following

112

search terms: “prevalence”, "diabetic", "diabetic foot", "ulcers", "diabetic foot ulcers", "patients".

113

Boolean operators like “AND” and “OR” were used to combine search terms. EndNote (version

114

X8) software for Windows was used to search, download, organize, and cite the related articles.

115

The reference lists of eligible articles were also searched to retrieve additional relevant articles.

116

All published and unpublished studies that report the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers among

117

diabetic patients in Ethiopia were included. Studies, which investigated the association between

118

duration of illness and patient residence with foot ulceration, were also included. Only these two

119

factors such as diabetic duration and patient residence have been similarly assessed across the

120

included studies. Therefore, we estimate the pooled effects of these factors to determine their

121

association with diabetic foot ulcers. The search for published studies was restricted to articles

122

published in English language. Furthermore, due to limited literature, we reviewed all

123

publications irrespective of publication year. Nevertheless, related articles which failed to report

124

the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers were excluded. The articles were searched from March

125

2019 to June 2019.

126

Data extraction

127

All the downloaded studies were independently screened for inclusion by two authors (HM and

128

GD). From each included study, information on the name of the first author, year of publication,

129

study area (region), health facility, study design, sample size, response rate, prevalence of

130

diabetic foot ulcers and determinant factors (Diabetic duration and patient residence) were

131

extracted using a pre-piloted template prepared in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. H.M. and H.A.

132

conducted the primary data extraction and then B.T., F.W., and H.Z. examined the extracted data

133

independently. Any disagreement and inconsistencies were resolved by discussion.

134

Quality assessment

135

We used the modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies adapted

136

from Modesti et al to assess the methodological and other quality of each relevant article. The

137

key criteria in the Newcastle–Ottawa scale are representativeness of the sample, response rate,

138

measurement tool used, comparability of the subject, appropriateness of the statistical test used

139

to analyze the data[22]. Two authors (B.T, and H.B) independently assessed the quality of each

140

article. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion and consensus.

142

A random-effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method[23] was employed to estimate

143

the pooled national prevalence and OR of risk factors with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The

144

result was presented using a forest plot. Heterogeneity across the studies was assessed by

145

Cochrane’s Q test and I2 statistic. I2 statistic ranges from 0 to 100 percent. We used the accepted

146

I2statistic > 50% to define significant heterogeneity across the included studies[24, 25].

147

Moreover, we explored the source of between-study heterogeneity using meta-regression

148

analysis. A funnel plot was used for visual assessment of publication bias. Asymmetry of the

149

funnel plot indicates the presence of publication bias[26, 27]. Egger’s tests were also used to

150

assess the significance of publication bias with a p-value less than 0.05[28]. Finally, a sensitivity

151

analysis was performed to assess whether the pooled prevalence estimates were influenced by

152

individual studies. All data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed using Stata

153

version 14.0 software for Windows.

154

Results

155

Study selection

156

The online search process initially yielded 1079 articles. Of which 21 articles duplicate records

157

were identified and removed. After reviewing the title and abstract, we excluded 1016 irrelevant

158

articles. From the remaining 42 articles, 32 articles were excluded since they failed to meet

159

eligibility criteria and having poor quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Finally, a total

160

of 10 relevant articles with 3,029 diabetic patients were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).

161

Study characteristics

162

The studies were conducted from 2000 to 2017 in different regions of the country. Of the 10

163

studies, three were conducted in Addis Ababa[29-31], three were in Amhara[32-34], two were in

Prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers

169

The pooled national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers among diabetic patients was 11.27% (95%

Assessment of Heterogeneity

174

In this meta-analysis, the presence of heterogeneity was checked by I2 statistics. The result of

175

this meta-analysis using the random-effects model revealed a high heterogeneity across the

176

included studies (I2 = 94.6%, P=0.001). The sources of variation were assessed using a meta-

177

regression model using publication year and sample size as covariates. The result of the meta-

178

regression analysis showed that both covariates were not statistically significant for the presence

179

of heterogeneity (Table 2).

Publication bias was examined by using a funnel plot and Egger’s test. Visual inspection of the

Association diabetic foot ulcers with diabetic duration and patient residence

191

Diabetic patients with duration of diabetes more than 10 years were 3.91 times more likely to

192

develop diabetic foot ulcers as compared with patients with duration of diabetes less than 10

193

years (OR, 3.91, 95% CI 2.03, 7.52, I2=63.4%) (Figure 5). Likewise, those diabetic patients who

194

lived in the rural area were 3.40 times more likely to develop diabetic foot ulcers than those who

195

lived in the urban area [OR = 3.40; 95% CI: 2.09, 5.54, I2=0.0%] (Figure 6).

Discussion

199

The global prevalence of diabetic complications is rising rapidly[40]. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)

200

is one of the major causes of morbidity, and it is responsible for 50% of diabetes-related hospital

201

admissions in hospitals[41]. Moreover, a systematic literature review revealed that diabetes and

202

related complications including foot ulceration are a common problem in Africa[42]. Early

203

diagnosis and management of diabetic foot are critical to prevent its serious consequences such

204

as infection, gangrene, and death[41].

205

In this study, the pooled national prevalence of diabetic foot among diabetic patients in Ethiopia

206

was 11.27%. This finding was comparable with reports from other similar studies in Asia[43, 44]

207

and Africa [45-47]. This might be due to similarities in the socio-demographic characteristics of
10

208

the study participants. On the other hand, our finding was higher than the global (i.e. 6.3%) and

209

national or continental (7.2% in Africa) prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers[19]. Likewise, our

210

finding is higher than other similar studies[48, 49]. One possible explanation for the high

211

prevalence of diabetic foot in Ethiopian diabetic patients might be due to variations in risk

212

factors such as poor diabetic-related knowledge and poor foot self-care practice. In spite of that,

213

the current study finding was lower than the study finding in Nigeria and Netherlands where the

214

prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers was 41.5% and 20.4% respectively[50, 51]. It could be due to a

215

difference in sample size and study setting.

216

Even though several factors have been reported as a risk factor of DFU in different literature[15,

217

44, 52-54], we have identified only two similar factors (duration of diabetes and patient

218

residence) across the included studies for analysis. In agreement with studies conducted in

219

Egypt, Iran and India[43, 54, 55], our study revealed that the duration of diabetes and patients’

220

residence had a significant association with a diabetic foot ulcer. Diabetic patients with long

221

duration are exposed to multiple complications like neuropathy, which may increase the risk of

222

foot ulceration due to trauma and high focal foot pressures[56]. Regarding residence, the

223

possible reason might be since individuals in rural areas in Ethiopia are farmers and are often

224

barefoot, which can result in damage to the foot and it leads to ulcers. Besides, most of the

225

people in rural areas of the country are poor with low educational level so that they have no

226

adequate knowledge and practice of foot care. However, the controversial result was reported

227

from Sudan where diabetic patients from the urban area have been shown significantly

228

associated with the development of DFU[57].

229

The findings of this meta-analysis have implications for clinical practice. Determining the

230

prevalence of DFU provides up-to-date evidence to develop prevention, public health planning

231

and management strategy for diabetic foot ulcers. It also used to improve patients’ quality of life

232

and reduce the economic burden. Moreover, identifying determinant factors help clinicians to

233

consider during their routine clinical practice. However, some limitations should be considered

234

in future researches. It was difficult to analyze some important major factors since they were not

235

examined consistently across the studies. Moreover, we identified significant heterogeneity

236

across the included studies and the presence of publication bias so that the interpretation of the

237

results has to be taken cautiously.

238

Conclusion

239

Available data suggest that the prevalence of active DFU in people with diabetes in Ethiopia was

240

high, but it is all derived from selected populations. Duration diabetes and Patients’ residence

241

were significant factors for foot ulceration. Diabetes care in Ethiopia needs to develop a high

242

standard of treatment guideline and preventive strategies to reduce the burden of DFU and

243

prevent its risk factors. Health education should be given to patients with a longer duration of

244

diabetes and those living in rural areas to reduce the progression of the disease and improve

245

health outcomes. Moreover, there is a clear need for a large-scale prospective study to determine

246

the extent of this important health care problem.
