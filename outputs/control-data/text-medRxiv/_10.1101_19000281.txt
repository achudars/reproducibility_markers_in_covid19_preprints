ABSTRACT
Background Clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients lack
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) microbiologic evidence, and misdiagnosis or delayed
diagnosis often occurs as a consequence. We investigated the potential of lncRNAs and
corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients.
Methods We enrolled 1372 subjects, including clinically diagnosed PTB patients, non-TB
disease controls and healthy controls, in three cohorts (Screening, Selection and Validation).
Candidate lncRNAs differentially expressed in blood samples of the PTB and healthy control
groups were identified by microarray and qRT-PCR in the Screening Cohort. Logistic
regression models were developed using lncRNAs and/or electronic health records (EHRs)
from clinically diagnosed PTB patients and non-TB disease controls in the Selection Cohort.
These models were evaluated by AUC and decision curve analysis, and the optimal model
was presented as a Web-based nomogram, which was evaluated in the Validation Cohort.
The biological function of lncRNAs was interrogated using ELISA, lactate dehydrogenase
release analysis and flow cytometry.
Results Three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, n335265)
were identified. The optimal model (i.e., nomogram) incorporated these three lncRNAs and
six EHR variables (age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, CT calcification and TBIGRA). The nomogram showed an AUC of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.82 in
the Validation Cohort, which demonstrated better discrimination and clinical net benefit than
the EHR model. ENST00000497872 may regulate inflammatory cytokine production, cell
death and apoptosis during MTB infection.

Conclusion LncRNAs and the user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the early
identification of PTB cases among suspected patients with negative MTB microbiologic
evidence.
Key Messages
What is the key question? Does integrating immune-related lncRNA signatures and
electronic health records (EHRs) promote the early identification of PTB patients who are
symptomatic but lack microbiologic evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)?

What is the bottom line? We found three long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), i.e.,
ENST00000497872, n333737 and n335265, were potential diagnostic biomarkers for
clinically diagnosed PTB patients; and we further developed and validated a novel nomogram
incorporating these three lncRNAs and six electronic health records (EHRs), which were
readily obtainable even in a resource-constrained setting and achieved a c-statistic of 0.89,
sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.82 in a separate validation cohort.

Why read on? This study focuses on the challenge of accurately diagnosing PTB patients
with negative MTB microbiological evidence and serves as the first proof-of-concept that
integrating lncRNA signatures and EHR data could be a more promising diagnostic approach
for clinically diagnosed PTB patients.

SUMMARY This study developed and validated a novel nomogram that incorporated three
lncRNAs and six EHR fields could be a useful predictive tool in identifying PTB patients
who lack MTB microbiologic evidence.

INTRODUCTION
TB is the leading cause of death from an infectious agent [1], but only 56% of PTB cases
reported to WHO in 2017 were bacteriologically confirmed. Thus, approximately half of all
PTB cases are clinically diagnosed worldwide, and this proportion can reach 68% in China
[1]. Clinically diagnosed PTB cases are symptomatic but lack evidence of MTB infection by
smear microscopy, culture or nucleic acid amplification test [1–3]. The diagnostic procedure
for clinically diagnosed PTB is inadequate and time-consuming and often results in
misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis [3], leading to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality
[4], or overtreatment [5]. There is thus an urgent need to develop rapid and accurate strategies
to diagnose PTB cases without MTB microbiologic evidence [6, 7]. The exploration of
effective host immune-response signatures represents an attractive approach for this type of
assay.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can function as critical regulators of inflammatory
responses to infection, especially for T-cell responses [8, 9]. Increasing evidence indicates
that blood lncRNA expression profiles are closely associated with TB disease [10–12],
suggesting lncRNAs could function as potential noninvasive biomarkers for TB detection.
However, previous studies have suffered from small sample size (ranging from 66 to 510)
and lack independent validation.
Recent effort has focused on establishing clinical prediction rules or predictive models for
TB diagnosis based on patients’ electronic health record (EHR) information [13–16]. Such
models can cost-effectively facilitate PTB diagnosis with a limited number of clinicalradiological predictors. For example, a 6-signature model from Griesel et al. (a cough lasting

≥14 days, the inability to walk unaided, a temperature > 39°C, chest radiograph assessment,
hemoglobin level and white cell count) attained an AUC of 0.81 [0.80-0.82] in seriously ill
HIV-infected PTB patients [13]. However, despite these advances, current EHR models

remain insufficient for precise TB diagnosis. Compelling studies have proposed that models
incorporating biomarkers and EHR information attain better performance for prediction of
sepsis [17] and abdominal aortic aneurysm [18]. We previously reported that combining
exosomal microRNAs and EHRs in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) achieved
AUCs of up to 0.97 versus an AUC of 0.67 obtained using EHR alone [19]. Based on these
studies, we hypothesized that combining lncRNAs with well-defined EHR predictors could
be used to develop improved predictive models to identify PTB cases that lack microbiologic
evidence of MTB infection.
This study was therefore performed to investigate the diagnostic potential of lncRNAs and
predictive models incorporating lncRNA and EHR data for the identification of PTB cases
without microbiologic MTB evidence. This study also explored the regulatory functions of
lncRNA candidates during MTB infection to evaluate the biological basis for their predictive
abilities.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study design
We performed this study through a four-stage approach. LncRNAs that were differentially
expressed (DE) between clinically diagnosed PTB patients and healthy subjects were profiled
by microarray in the Screening Step. The expression of top five lncRNAs were then analyzed
in a large prospective cohort in the Selection Step of the study, which reduced the number of
five lncRNAs to three based on expression difference among groups. In the Model Training
Step, lncRNAs and EHRs were used to develop predictive models for clinically diagnosed
PTB patients and non-tuberculosis disease control (non-TB DC) patients, and the optimal
model was visualized as a nomogram. Finally, we validated lncRNAs and the nomogram in

an independent prospective cohort. Functional analyses were also performed to elucidate the
biological significance of lncRNAs. The study strategy is shown in Figure 1.
Subjects enrolment
Screening Cohort We retrospectively collected age- and gender-matched 7 PTB cases and 5
healthy controls as the Screening Cohort. They were 6 males and 6 females from ages 22 to
59 years. PTB cases were clinically confirmed PTB patients with positive TB symptoms,
negative MTB pathogenic examinations, and good response to anti-TB therapy. Healthy
subjects had a normal physical examination and no history of TB.
Selection Cohort and Validation Cohort Inpatients with clinical-radiological suspicion of
PTB but lacking evidence of MTB infection were prospectively enrolled from West China
Hospital between Dec 2014 and May 2017. The inclusion criteria for highly suspected
patients were: (a) new patients with high clinical-radiological suspicion of PTB, (b) anti-TB
therapy < 7 days on admission, (c) patients with negative MTB evidence (i.e., at least two
consecutive negative smears, one negative MTB-DNA PCR and one negative culture result),
(d) age ≥ 15 years, and (e) patients without severe immunosuppressive disease, HIV infection,
or cardiac or renal failure. Two experienced pulmonologists reviewed and diagnosed all
presumptive PTB patients, and final diagnoses for all cases were based on the combination of
clinical assessment, radiological and laboratory results, response to the treatment [1, 2]. A 12month follow-up observation was used to confirm the classification of PTB and non-TB
patients. The detailed description of patients’ symptoms and recruitment, inclusion and
exclusion criteria, laboratory examinations, diagnostic criteria and procedure, treatment, and
sample size estimate are provided in Supplemental Methods, Section 1–2. In addition, healthy
subjects were simultaneously recruited from a pool of healthy donors with a normal physical
examination and no history of TB.

We finally enrolled a Selection Cohort of 878 participants (141 clinically diagnosed PTB,
159 non-TB DC, and 578 healthy subjects) and an independent Validation Cohort of 482
participants (97 clinically diagnosed PTB, 140 non-TB DC, and 245 healthy subjects).
Details of the non-TB DC are listed in Table S1. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Clinical Trials and Biomedical Ethics Committee of West China [no. 2014 (198)]. Informed
consents were obtained from every participant.
LncRNA detection
RNA isolation and cDNA preparation Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples
were isolated from fresh 3 ml blood samples of each participant using a Human Lymphocyte
Separation Tube Kit (Dakewe Biotech Company Limited, China). Total RNA was extracted
from PBMC isolates using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA concentration and purity
were evaluated spectrophotometrically, and RNA integrity was determined using agarose gel
electrophoresis (Figure S1A). The PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara,
Japan) was used to remove contaminating genomic DNA and synthesize cDNA.
LncRNA microarray profiling LncRNA profiles were detected using Affymetrix Human
Transcriptome Array 2.0 Chips based on a standard protocol [20]. Raw data were normalized
using the Robust Multi-Array Average Expression Measure algorithm. DE lncRNAs with pvalues < 0.05 and fold-changes > 2 were identified using the empirical Bayes moderated tstatistics and presented by hierarchical clustering and volcano plot [21]. Microarray data have
been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession GSE119143.
qRT-PCR for lncRNAs LncRNA expression was measured using the SYBR® Green PCR Kit
(Takara, Japan) in a blinded fashion, normalized to the endogenous control GAPDH, and
calculated according to the 2 -ΔΔ Cq method where and Cq < 35 was considered acceptable
[22]. Specific primers are presented in Table S2. PCR curves and the standard curve are

shown in Figure S1B-C. Detailed methodology for RNA isolation, reverse transcription,
qRT-PCR detection (procedure, quality control, product verification, and stability test) are
presented in Supplemental Methods, Section 3.
Modeling
Data used for modeling A total of 41 EHRs, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and
radiological findings were collected (see Supplemental Methods, Section 4), and a 20%
missing value threshold was applied to remove incomplete features. Features with p-values <
0.05 in univariate analysis or definite clinical significance were included for modeling. A
total of 14 of the 44 original variables (41 EHRs and 3 lncRNAs) remained after filtering,
including 11 EHRs and 3 lncRNAs (see Supplemental Methods, Section 4).
Diagnostic modeling Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop predictive models
to distinguish clinically diagnosed PTB from patients with suspected PTB cases in the
Selection Cohort. Feature subsets were selected and compared using the best subset selection
procedure [23] and 10-fold cross-validation. The "EHR+lncRNA", "lncRNA only" and "EHR
only" models were developed according to their respective best feature subset in the Selection
Cohort. A cutoff of each model was determined by combining the Youden’s index and the
sensitivity for the samples in the training dataset equal to or greater than 0.85. The models
including their cutoff were used for evaluation of the Validation Cohort.
Nomogram presentation and evaluation We further adopted the nomogram to visualize the
optimal model with the best AUC [24, 25]. Nomogram calibration was assessed with the
calibration curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p-value > 0.05 suggested no departure from
perfect fit). The performance of the nomogram was tested in the independent Validation
Cohort, with total points for each patient calculated. Decision curve analysis (DCA) [25] was
performed by evaluating the clinical net benefit of the nomogram and "EHR only" model

across the overall datasets. Assessing clinical value involves comparing the nomogram and
“EHR only” model using the 500 bootstrap method. The nomogram was implemented as a
Web-based app using R Shiny.
Analysis of ENST00000497872 (lnc AL) function
The lncRNA with the most significant difference in our analysis, ENST00000497872 (lnc AL)
was analyzed in functional studies. THP-1 cells with stable overexpression and knockdown
of lnc AL were constructed using recombinant lentivirus vector (LV). THP-1 cells transfected
with these vectors were incubated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) to imitate active
MTB-infection [26]. This study examined the effect BCG exposure on THP-1 cells in five
groups transfected with vectors to overexpress (LV-lnc AL) or suppress (shRNA-lnc AL) lnc
AL expression, their respective empty vector constructs (LV-control and shRNA-control), or
with no vector (blank control). Cell culture supernatants were harvested to measure lnc AL
and the expression of six cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-12 p70, IL-10, IFN-γ, and IL-6). Cell
apoptosis and cytotoxicity after 24 h infection were detected by flow cytometry and the
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release analysis, respectively. Detailed methodology for these
experiments is presented in Supplementary Methods, Section 5.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were analyzed by univariate analysis with a Chi-square test and
continuous variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests or Student’s t-tests. All tests
were 2-sided, and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Modeling was
constructed and validated by individuals who were blinded to diagnostic categorizations. R
code and data for modeling are available from

RESULTS
Characteristics of prospectively enrolled participants
The demographic and clinical characteristics of participants in the Selection and Validation
Cohorts are provided in Table 1. PTB patients were younger and had greater IGRA positivity
rates than their non-TB DC (p-value < 0.0001 for both the Selection and Validation Cohorts),
but these groups did not differ by gender, BMI, or smoking status. Healthy subjects were age-,
gender-, and BMI-matched with PTB patients, who had significantly different blood test
results compared with PTB patients (Table 1).
Clinically diagnosed PTB patients were responsible for 29.82% (238/798) of all active
PTB patients (Supplemental Methods Section 1). This rate is markedly lower than a
nationwide estimate of 68% based on primary public health institutions [1], but represents the
clinically diagnosed PTB rate in a referral hospital with experienced specialists.
LncRNAs microarray profiles and candidate selection
In the Screening Step, microarray profiling identified a total of 325 lncRNAs that were
differentially expressed (287 upregulated and 38 downregulated) in the clinically diagnosed
PTB patients versus healthy subjects. Hierarchical clustering and a volcano plot revealed
clearly distinguishable lncRNA expression profiles (Figure S2). Top five lncRNA candidates
were chosen based on a set of combined criteria: fold-change > 2 between groups, p-value <
0.05, signal intensity > 25 [27], and including unreported lncRNAs in TB literature [28].
Three of these five lncRNAs were upregulated (n335265, ENST00000518552 and
TCONS_00013664) and two were downregulated (n333737 and ENST00000497872) in PTB
versus control subjects (Table S3).

The expression level of these five candidate lncRNAs was measured by qRT-PCR in the
Selection Cohort, which consisted of 141 clinically diagnosed PTB, 159 non-TB DC, and 578
healthy subjects. Two lncRNAs (ENST00000518552 and TCONS_00013664) were excluded
from further analysis due to their low abundance expression (Cq > 35) in this cohort. Of the
three remaining lncRNAs, ENST00000497872 and n333737 were downregulated and
n335265 was upregulated in PTB patients versus healthy subjects (Table S4). Comparison
between clinically diagnosed PTB cases and non-TB DC patients revealed a decreased
expression of ENST00000497872 and n333737 in PTB patients (Figure S3A), age-adjusted pvalues both < 0.0001).
Short-term stability, an essential prerequisite of a potential lncRNA biomarker, was
assessed in PBMC samples. This study found that incubation up to 24 h had minimal effect
on the expression of ENST00000497872, n333737, and n335265 (Table S5), in accordance
with a previous report of lncRNA stability in blood [29].
Diagnostic modeling and nomogram visualization
Three logistic regression models, "EHR+lncRNA", "EHR only", and "lncRNA only" were
evaluated as part of the training step in the Selection Cohort (Supplemental Methods, Section
4). The variance inflation factors between the features ranged from 1.02 to 1.29, indicating no
collinearity within models. The "EHR+lncRNA" model yielded the highest AUC (0.92) for
distinguishing clinically diagnosed PTB from suspected PTB patients, compared to AUCs of
0.87 and 0.82 for the "EHR only" and "lncRNA only" models, respectively (Figure 2A). The
"EHR+lncRNA" model also had the best performance in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (Table 2).
The optimal "EHR+lncRNA" model was displayed as a nomogram (Figure 3A), and the
top five features of the nomogram were ENST00000497872, age, n333737, CT calcification,
and TB-IGRA results (Table S6). Seneitivity and specificity of the nomogram for prediction

of clinically diagnosed PTB was 0.89 (0.82-0.93) and 0.80 (0.73-0.85) at a cutoff of 0.37
(Table 2). A calibration curve in the Selection Cohort (Figure 3B) indicated a good
agreement between nomogram prediction and actual PTB cases and was confirmed by the
nonsignificant Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p-value = 0.957). This nomogram was generated as a
free online app (available at https://xuejiao.shinyapps.io/shiny/) to facilitate its access for
other studies. This app allows the user to insert the values of specific predictors and provides
the risk prediction as a whole number percentage.
Validation for lncRNAs and the nomogram
In the Validation Step, the three candidate lncRNAs were analyzed in an independent
Validation Cohort contains 97 clinically diagnosed PTB cases, 140 non-TB DC and 245
healthy subjects. This analysis observed an lncRNA expression pattern similar to that
observed in the Selection Cohort (Table S4, Figure S3B). All three models were applied to
the Validation Cohort, and as reported in Table 2 and Figure 2 it was found that the
nomogram achieved superior discrimination (AUC: 0.89 [0.84-0.93]), good calibration
(Figure 3B, and p-value = 0.668 for Hosmer-Lemeshow test) for clinically diagnosed PTB
prediction. The sensitivity and specificity of the nomogram at the cutoff of 0.37 in the
Validation Cohort was 0.86 (0.77-0.90) and 0.82 (0.75-0.87), respectively. DCA indicated
that the nomogram outperformed the conventional "EHR only" model with a higher clinical
net benefit within a threshold probability range from 0.2 to 1 (Figure 3C).
LncRNA response to anti-TB treatment
LncRNAs were next analyzed for the ability to predict anti-TB treatment response. Paired
samples were collected from 22 clinically diagnosed PTB patients before and after 2-month
intensive therapy [30], and the expressions of ENST00000497872, n333737, and n335265
were measured by qRT-PCR. All these patients had good response to therapy based on the

clinical and radiological findings, and ENST00000497872 and n333737 levels significantly
increased post-treatment (p-values = 0.005 and 0.0005, respectively, Figure 4), suggesting
that lncRNA expression increased in response to therapy.
Functional studies of ENST00000497872
We investigated whether ENST00000497872 (i.e., lnc AL) could affect the host immune
response. At 24 h and 48 h post BCG-infection, lnc AL overexpression (Figure S4) led to
decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β and an increase in INF-

γ (Figure 5A). Conversely, knockdown of lnc AL resulted in a significant TNF-α and IL-1β
increases and an INF-γ reduction. Lnc AL knockdown was also associated with an increasing
trend of cell apoptosis (Figure 5B and 5C) and cell death (Figure 5D). These results implicate
an inflammatory regulation of lnc AL during MTB-infection.

DISCUSSION
The present work focused on the challenge of accurately diagnosing PTB patients without
microbiological evidence of MTB infection. Our study showed that three lncRNAs
(ENST00000497872, n333737, and n335265) were potential biomarkers for clinically
diagnosed PTB patients. Addition of three lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737 and
n335265) to a conventional EHR model improved its ability to identify PTB cases from TB
suspects, with the AUCs increasing from 0.83 to 0.89. The lncRNA that was most
significantly enriched in the PTB group of this study, ENST00000497872 (chr14:105703964105704602), is located close to IGHA1 (chr14: 105703995-105708665), and functional
analyses indicated that expression of this lncRNA was involved in the regulation of
inflammatory cytokine production and cell apoptosis in MTB-infected macrophages,

although further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms responsible. Consistent
with published lncRNA data [8–12, 31], this data provide new evidence that lncRNAs could
participate in TB immunoregulation and serve as promising biomarkers for TB diagnosis.
In addition to the three lncRNAs, we identified six EHR predictors (age, CT calcification,
positive TB-IGRA, low-grade fever, elevated hemoglobin, and weight loss) that were
essential in TB case finding, as proposed by prior findings [15, 16]. Age was an important
negative predictor for clinically diagnosed PTB, which appears to conflict with the consensus
that advanced age correlates with higher TB susceptibility [32]. This may be explained by
differences in the enrollment of the PTB patients and control subjects. Previous studies
included healthy and/or vulnerable subjects as controls, while we enrolled inpatients with a
wide range of pulmonary diseases and older ages as disease controls.
This study serves as a first proof-of-concept study to show that integrating lncRNA
signatures and EHR data could be a more promising diagnostic approach for PTB patients
with negative MTB pathogenic evidence. The "EHR+lncRNA" model had good
discrimination (through AUC and diagnostic parameters), reliable calibration (via calibration
curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test), and potential clinical utility for decision-making (using
DCA). The "EHR+lncRNA" model avoided some common problems associated with
sputum-based features, such as poor sputum quality or problematic sampling [33], to improve
its reliability and clinical utility. Nomogram has been shown to remarkably promote early
diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis [24] and prognosis prediction in PTB [34] and TBM [35].
"EHR+lncRNA" model herein was visualized as a nomogram and further implemented in an
app. The online nomogram uses readily obtainable predictors and automatically outputs a
personalized quantitative risk estimate for PTB. Utilizing this user-friendly tool may facilitate
the rapid identification of PTB cases among suspected TB patients without MTB

microbiologic evidence to improve TB diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained areas
with high TB prevalence.
Our study has several limitations. Modeling in this study was conducted based on data
from a single large hospital, and multi-center validation studies are needed. Further, because
Xpert MTB/RIF is still not routinely available in most clinical laboratories of China, and
since previous Xpert studies reported moderate sensitivities ranged from 28% to 73% [36–38]
in smear-negative PTB patients, we did not consider Xpert in our research, which may limit
the generalization of our findings.
In summary, a novel nomogram we developed and validated in this study that incorporated
three lncRNAs and six EHR fields may be a useful predictive tool in identifying PTB patients
with negative MTB pathogenic evidence, and merits further investigation.

The median and interquartile range of log2 lncRNA were as follows: ENST00000497872 (before: -1.91 [-2.74, -1.11]; after: -1.55 [-2.61, -0.79]), n333737: (before: 3.88 [-4.81, -3.33] ; after: -2.30 [-2.99, -0.50]), n335265 (before: 2.12 [1.05, 2.34]; after: 1.29 [0.85, 1.69]), respectively.

(A), Cytokine expression. (B), Flow cytometry analysis of cell apoptosis. (C), Graph of apoptosis data. (D), LDH release analysis of cell cytotoxicity for BCGinfected THP-1 cells. LV-control and shRNA-control mean values considered negative control values, and the blank control is not shown. Three cytokines (IL-12 p70,
IL-10 and IL-6) did not significantly differ and are not shown. Difference between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post-test comparison
among groups (*p-value < 0.05, **p-value < 0.01, and ***p-value < 0.001).
