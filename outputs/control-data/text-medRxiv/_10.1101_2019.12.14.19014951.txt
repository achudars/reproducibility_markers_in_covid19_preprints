Abstract

28

Background

29

Disease severity is considered to be an important factor for inclusion of diseases on expanded

30

carrier screening (ECS) panels. Evaluating severity requires an objective, systematic method.

31

Here, we applied a validated algorithm that objectively categorizes disease severity into one of

32

four categories—profound, severe, moderate, and mild—to 176 genes on a clinically available

33

ECS panel.

34

Methods

35

Eight genetic counselors (GCs) working in pairs, followed by four medical geneticists (MDs)

36

working in pairs, applied the algorithm to subsets of the 176 genes.

37

Results

38

Upon initial GC and MD review, 107/176 genes (61%) and 133/176 genes (76%), respectively,

39

had concordant classifications, with consensus reached for all genes after collaborative review.

40

Final severity classifications were 68 (39%) profound, 71 (40%) severe, 36 (20%) moderate,

41

and one (1%) mild. No classification biases were detected within the GC or MD pairs.

42

Conclusion

43

This study illustrates an approach to severity classification for large sets of Mendelian genes.

44

The observed level of initial discordance demonstrates the complexity of severity and

45

underscores the importance of collaboration involving multiple clinicians. Severity classification,

46

in addition to other factors suggested by ACOG, is an important factor for laboratories to

47

consider as they aim to design clinically valid ECS panels.

Introduction

54

Carrier screening seeks to identify couples at risk of conceiving a pregnancy affected by a

55

genetic disease, thereby informing reproductive decision-making and pregnancy management.

56

Expanded carrier screening (ECS), which has become increasingly utilized, accomplishes this

57

for dozens to hundreds of diseases, in comparison to traditional ethnicity based screening

58

approaches meant to detect limited conditions prevalent within those ethnic groups (Haque et

59

al., 2016). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) considers ECS to

60

be an acceptable screening strategy and has proposed multiple criteria for disease inclusion on

61

ECS panels (ACOG Committee on Genetics, 2017). One criterion addresses disease severity,

62

suggesting that disorders selected for screening panels should have a detrimental effect on

63

quality of life, cause cognitive or physical impairment, require surgical or medical intervention, or

64

have an onset early in life (ACOG Committee on Genetics, 2017). Similarly, the American

65

College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) position statement on ECS states that

66

“disorders should be of a nature that most at-risk patients and their partners identified in the

67

screening program would consider having prenatal diagnosis to facilitate making decisions

68

around reproduction” and that “there must be a validated clinical association between the

69

mutation(s) detected and the severity of the disorder” (Grody et al., 2013). However, the

70

concept of severity can be subjective; individuals have varying perceptions of it based on their

71

valuation of phenotypic characteristics (Kraft et al., 2018; Lazarin et al., 2014).

72
73

Disease severity inclusion criteria for ECS panels have not been widely studied. However,

74

multiple studies have shown that disease categorization is helpful for patients in understanding

75

the types of diseases included on ECS panels and facilitates reproductive decision-making

76

(Ghiossi, Goldberg, Haque, Lazarin, & Wong, 2018; Johansen Taber et al., 2019; Kraft et al.,

77

2018).

79

In 2014, Lazarin et al. published a framework to objectively categorize disease severity. In the

80

study, 192 health care providers rated 13 individual disease traits, independent of any named

81

genetic disease. Disease traits (e.g., limited life span, intellectual disability), as opposed to

82

diseases themselves, were evaluated because, despite health care providers’ potential lack of

83

familiarity with many rare genetic diseases, the traits associated with them are often

84

encountered by health care providers regardless of the etiology. The analysis established and

85

validated an algorithm that can be applied to a disease, with its given set of individual

86

phenotypic traits, resulting in a classification of the condition into one of four severity categories:

87

profound, severe, moderate, and mild (Lazarin et al., 2014). The phenotypic characteristics that

88

define each severity category correspond to the criteria ACOG has set forth for determining

89

whether the severity of a given disease warrants inclusion on an ECS panel (Table 1). Both the

90

profound and severe categories are characterized by a detrimental effect on quality of life,

91

cognitive or physical impairment, a requirement for surgical or medical intervention, and an

92

onset early in life. The moderate category is characterized by a detrimental effect on quality of

93

life, a requirement for surgical or medical intervention, and an onset early in life. The mild

94

category does not meet any of the phenotypic characteristics set forth by ACOG.

95
96

The health care provider participants in Lazarin et al. (2014) were comprised largely of

97

physicians and genetic counselors working in reproductive or obstetrics settings and did not

98

include participants with specialized knowledge of the diseases used in the validation of the

99

algorithm. To date, no published studies have rigorously applied the algorithm using health care

100

providers with such specialized knowledge, nor has it been applied to the large number of

101

diseases currently included on many ECS panels. In this study, we aimed to assign an objective

102

severity classification to genetic diseases in order to inform consideration of their inclusion on

103

ECS panels. We addressed the limitations of the previously described study by engaging

104

genetic counselors from clinical pediatric settings and medical geneticists who have expertise in

105

rare diseases commonly found on ECS panels. These health care providers applied the

106

algorithm to the 176 genes found on a commercially available ECS panel to classify each into

107

severity categories.

Editorial Policies and Ethical Considerations

111

This study did not use patient samples or results and therefore was not subject to review by an

112

institutional review board or ethics committee.

113
114

Gene Classifications

115

Eight genetic counselors (GCs) from pediatric clinical settings and four medical geneticists

116

applied a published severity algorithm to randomly assigned subsets of 176 genes offered on a

117

commercially available ECS panel (Foresight, Myriad Women’s Health) (Lazarin et al., 2014).

118

The algorithm was applied in a two-step review and consensus process as described below.

119

Honoraria were provided to each GC and medical geneticist participant.

120
121

In the first step, the 176 genes were randomly divided into four subsets of 44, and a pair of GCs

122

was assigned to each subset so that each gene was evaluated by at least two GCs (Figure 2).

123

Each GC used the algorithm (Figure 1) to independently classify the assigned genes and the

124

associated phenotype arising in untreated, affected individuals (i.e., those with one or two

125

pathogenic mutations, depending on the inheritance pattern of the condition) as profound,

126

severe, moderate, or mild. After the initial independent review, each pair of GCs was notified of

127

genes classified discordantly between them and were then asked to review their initial severity

128

classifications together to come to a final classification consensus for each gene. Factors

129

contributing to initial discordant classifications were collected and reviewed.

131

In the second step (following GC review), two pairs of medical geneticists (referred to

132

throughout as “MDs”) used the algorithm (Figure 1) to independently classify the assigned

133

genes and the associated phenotype, with each MD pair reviewing 88 genes (Figure 2). Final

134

GC severity classifications were available to the MDs prior to their individual evaluation. After

135

independent review, each MD pair was notified of genes classified discordantly within the MD

136

pair and/or discordantly between MD and GC final classifications. The MD pairs were asked to

137

reach a final consensus classification and provide factors that contributed to this final

138

classification decision. Factors contributing to discordances between MDs, as well as factors

139

contributing to the final classification, were collected and reviewed.

140
141

Data Analysis

142

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize general data trends. Statistical significance

143

between proportions was determined using chi-square analysis; a result was considered

144

significant when p<0.05 at the 99% confidence level.

145
146

Permutation Testing

147

Permutation testing was conducted to determine whether particular individuals within each GC

148

(1-4) or MD (1-2) pair consistently classified disease genes as higher or lower in severity than

149

their counterpart. Qualitative disease severity classifications were converted to a numeric scale

150

ranging from 1 to 3, with 1 being the least severe classification (mild) and 3 being the most

151

severe classification (genes classified as severe or profound were collapsed into one category

152

as they both meet the same ACOG inclusion criteria [Table 1]). For genes assigned to MD Pair

153

1 where one individual failed to classify a gene, the gene was ignored. Using the numerical

154

scale of severity, we then took the mean of the gene set assigned to each pair for each

155

individual and measured the absolute difference between the two GCs or two MDs to generate

156

an observed value of difference.

157
158

To run the permutation test, observed classifications within each GC pair and MD pair were

159

permuted for each gene by randomly switching the observed classifications given by the

160

individuals within the pair, repeating 100,000 times for the full set of assigned genes for each

161

pair. After each permutation iteration, the mean of severity classifications was measured across

162

the assigned genes and the absolute difference was calculated among the two members in

163

each pair, generating a permuted value of difference. Significance was assessed by calculating

164

the fraction of permuted values of difference that were greater than or equal to the observed

165

value for a particular GC or MD pair, generating an empirical p-value for the permutation test.

169

Genetic Counselor Review and Classification

170

After initial review by the GC pairs, 107 of the 176 disease-associated genes (61%) had

171

concordant classifications (Figure 3A, Supplemental Table 1). Concordances between the GC

172

pairs ranged from 47.7% to 68.2%, with 30 concordant classifications (68.2%) after initial review

173

by GC Pair 1, 21 (47.7%) after initial review by GC Pair 2, 29 (65.9%) after initial review by GC

174

Pair 3, and 27 (61.4%) after initial review by GC Pair 4. With the exception of four genes

175

(NR0B1, ABCC8, KCNJ11, CYP21A2), all discordant classifications were within one level of

176

severity classification (Figure 3A, Supplemental Table 1). A permutation test was conducted to

177

determine whether any individual within each GC pair tended to classify genes as more or less

178

severe compared to their counterpart. For the permutation test, genes classified as severe or

179

profound were collapsed into one category as they both meet the same ACOG inclusion criteria

180

(Table 1). We found no significant difference in the tendency of any individual within a GC pair

181

to classify disease genes as more or less severe on average than his/her counterpart (all p >

182

0.05; Figure 4).

183
184

Reasons for discordances noted by the GC pairs included difficulties in determining the primary

185

phenotype associated with a specific disease with varying severity, difficulty discerning the level

186

of intellectual disability associated with the disease from the available literature, and inability to

187

locate published data regarding life expectancies and phenotypic differences in various forms of

188

the conditions. After final review of discordances and consensus on final classifications between

189

each GC pair, 65 genes (36.9%) were categorized as profound, 65 (36.9%) as severe, 42

190

(23.9%) as moderate, and four (2.3%) as mild (Supplemental Table 1).

191
192

Medical Geneticist Review and Classification

193

After initial review by each member of the MD pair, 133 of the 176 disease-associated genes

194

(76%) had concordant classifications (Figure 3B, Supplemental Table 1). Concordance within

195

the two MD pairs ranged from 67% to 84.1%, with 74 (84.1%) concordant classifications after

196

initial review by MD Pair 1 and 59 (67%) after initial review by MD Pair 2. One member of MD

197

Pair 1 did not definitively classify five genes; these were considered as discordances. All but

198

one discordant classification (SLC22A5) was within one level of severity classification (Figure

199

3B, Supplemental Table 1). A permutation test was conducted to determine whether any

200

individual within each MD pair tended to classify genes as more or less severe compared to

201

his/her counterpart. As noted above for analysis of GC discordances, genes classified as severe

202

or profound were also collapsed into one category for permutation testing as both categories

203

meet the same ACOG inclusion criteria (Table 1). No significant difference was observed in the

204

tendency of any individual within an MD pair to classify disease genes as more or less severe

205

on average than his/her counterpart (MD Pair 1: p=0.218, MD Pair 2: p=0.421; Figure 4).

206
207

Reasons for discordances included no definitive classification, multiple phenotypes associated

208

with the gene, unknown percentages of individuals with intellectual disability or reduced

209

lifespan, and difficulties in determining life expectancy in the untreated state for conditions for

210

which treatment is available. After final MD review of discordances and consensus on final

211

classifications, 68 (38.6%) genes were categorized as profound, 71 (40.3%) as severe, 36

212

(20.5%) as moderate, and one (0.6%) as mild (Supplemental Table 1). Comparison of GC and

213

MD classifications revealed no significant differences in the number of genes ultimately

214

classified within each severity category (36.9% vs. 38.6% Profound, p=0.74; 39.6% vs. 40.3%

215

Severe, p=0.51; 23.9% vs. 20.5% Moderate, p=0.44; 2.3% vs. 0.6% Mild, p=0.18).

216
217

Discussion

218

The severity classification framework applied here provides a systematic approach to evaluate

219

the severity of genes that are included in ECS panels. Herein, health care providers with

220

expertise in pediatric and genetic disease used it to classify the severity of 176 genes on a

221

commercially available ECS panel. Professional consensus was reached in the event of initial

222

classification discordance, however, discordances among health professionals with specialized

223

expertise demonstrate the potentially subjective nature of severity.

224
225

Subjectivity in Guidelines

226

Guidelines stipulate severity as an important criterion for ECS panel inclusion yet describe the

227

criterion in terms that can be subjectively interpreted. For example, ACOG states that “disorders

228

should have a detrimental effect on quality of life, cause cognitive or physical impairment,

229

require surgical or medical intervention, or have an onset early in life.” But “detrimental” could

230

apply to a range of phenotypes, and “onset early in life” could mean any time before adulthood.

231

Impairments and interventions can be binarily defined—e.g., both cardiac surgery and hearing

232

aids are interventions—but it is unclear as to what type of intervention is sufficient to qualify a

233

disorder for inclusion. Many rare diseases screened by ECS do not have treatments that

234

reverse the course of disease, but nevertheless have interventions that improve the quality of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014951; this version posted December 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this

235

life for those affected by delaying or halting the onset of symptoms or lessening the severity of

236

one or more phenotypic characteristics of the disease.

237
238

ACMG states that disorders included on ECS panels “should be of a nature that most at-risk

239

patients and their partners identified in the screening program would consider having a prenatal

240

diagnosis to facilitate decision making around reproduction.” We agree with the sentiment that

241

providers and couples fully discuss the disease for which the couple’s current or future

242

pregnancy is at risk, including the severity of the disease, to determine the couple’s desire to

243

undergo prenatal diagnosis or interventions to reduce the risk of an affected pregnancy. But the

244

ACMG guidance provides little direction for panel design. It implies that patients themselves

245

determine the disorders to be included but does not address how this could logistically occur.

246

The majority of patients are unfamiliar with conditions on carrier panels (as are many providers),

247

so a large-scale study of patients’ willingness to undergo diagnostic testing for each condition

248

may not be feasible. Indeed, this is the reason that Kraft et al. (2018) grouped conditions into

249

severity categories when asking patients the diseases for which they preferred to be screened.

250

The approach suggested by ACMG also conflicts with the norm of practice guidelines originating

251

from a review of evidence by medical professional societies rather than community views

252

(ACOG Committee on Genetics, 2017; Grody et al., 2013).

253
254

Both the ACOG and ACMG statements aim to provide simplified guidance regarding severity in

255

the face of complex variability in genetic disease. Previous studies have attempted to

256

specifically define the range of phenotypes caused by a genetic disease (Korngiebel et al.,

257

2016; Lazarin et al., 2014), but our study demonstrates the complexity of the notion of severity.

258

Initial classification discordance by health care providers with expertise in pediatric and genetic

259

disease demonstrates that severity is subjective and may not fit neatly into categories. The fact

260

that both profound and severe conditions meet the same ACOG severity criteria is yet another

261

indicator of the difficulty in definitive classification. These data suggest that severity cannot be

262

strictly defined and that rigid severity level requirements for inclusion on ECS panels should be

263

reconsidered.

264
265

Utility of screening for moderate severity conditions by expanded carrier screening

266

The term “moderate” as a descriptor of severity may connote to some that the disease does not

267

rise to a level of significance for a couple wanting to know their risk for having a pregnancy

268

affected by genetic disease. However, moderate severity conditions meet three of the four

269

criteria set forth by ACOG as important for choosing conditions to be included on an ECS panel:

270

they have a detrimental effect on quality of life, a requirement for surgical or medical

271

intervention, and an onset early in life (ACOG Committee on Genetics, 2017). As an example,

272

GJB2, variants in which cause non-syndromic hearing loss and deafness, was categorized by

273

this study as having moderate severity. This condition has an onset at birth, and numerous

274

studies have demonstrated the importance of early identification and intervention for individuals

275

with hearing loss. If not detected early, hearing loss complicates childhood development in

276

language, socialization, academic performance, and most importantly human development and

277

self-actualization (Fulcher, Purcell, Baker, & Munro, 2012; May-Mederake, 2012; Moeller, 2000;

278

Poonual, Navacharoen, Kangsanarak, & Namwongprom, 2017). In addition, interventions such

279

as cochlear implants can effectively avert these developmental delays (Fulcher et al., 2012).

280
281

Previous studies have also shown that couples find value in screening for moderate severity

282

conditions. Two clinical utility studies found that a majority of couples identified by ECS to be at

283

risk for pregnancies affected by moderate severity conditions made reproductive and pregnancy

284

management decisions for future family planning based on knowledge of such risk (Ghiossi et

285

al., 2018; Johansen Taber et al., 2019). A separate study assessing patient preferences for

286

receipt of carrier screening results found that patients preferred to receive ECS results on

287

conditions in all severity categories, including moderate, and reported that severity

288

classifications informed their choice as to the conditions for which they wanted to undergo

289

screening (Kraft et al., 2018). These studies imply that couples value and utilize ECS results for

290

conditions across the severity spectrum. The utility of early identification and intervention for

291

genetic conditions, even those categorized as moderate severity, along with patient preferences

292

for screening for moderate severity conditions, suggests that they should be included in carrier

293

screening panels.

295

Categorizing genes vs diseases

296

Next-generation sequencing advances have led to increasingly comprehensive ECS assays,

297

both in number of diseases tested and in mutational coverage of genes. While greater mutation

298

detection increases clinical sensitivity, it also reveals the phenotypic spectrum caused by

299

varying mutations within a given gene. Indeed, this variable expressivity was a cause of

300

discordant classifications upon initial review by both GCs and MDs, though they were ultimately

301

able to reach a consensus classification. We propose that, rather than considering diseases to

302

be included on ECS panels, a discussion should instead focus on the specific genes, the

303

approach taken by this study. This was necessary because some conditions are caused by

304

multiple genes (i.e. Usher Syndrome, Fanconi Anemia, Niemann Pick Disease) and some

305

genes are associated with multiple conditions (i.e. HBB, FKTN, MYO7A). Additionally, growing

306

evidence illustrates the difficulty in correlating genotype and phenotype for certain genetic

307

conditions with variable penetrance (Strande et al., 2017). The framework published by Lazarin

308

et al. (2014) and applied here takes these complexities into consideration and focuses on

309

characteristics present in at least 25% of individuals with mutations in a given gene.

Complexity of ECS panel design

312

ECS is complex by nature, typically involving dozens of conditions; addressing these

313

complexities as they arise helps to optimize patient care. Both this study and Kraft et al. (2018)

314

revealed the difficulty in assigning severity to rare conditions, often because published literature

315

about such conditions is sparse, phenotypes are variable, and availability of treatment for

316

certain conditions is limited. Yet difficulty in assigning severity does not diminish the need to

317

provide counseling and education to patients about the severity of conditions that they or their

318

family members are facing. Several analyses have suggested additional factors to be

319

considered in optimal panel design, including clinical sensitivity, actionability, and prevalence of

320

each condition (Beauchamp et al., 2018; Ben-Shachar, Svenson, Goldberg, & Muzzey, 2019;

321

Chokoshvili, Vears, & Borry, 2018; Stevens, Krstic, Jones, Murphy, & Hoskovec, 2017). ACOG

322

also suggests several criteria other than severity that should guide ECS panel design, including

323

a carrier frequency of one percent and the ability to diagnose the disease prenatally (ACOG

324

Committee on Genetics, 2017). We suggest that conditions categorized as moderate severity or

325

higher meet ACOG’s severity criteria for inclusion on a panel, and that ACOG’s and other

326

researchers’ additional suggested factors be used in combination to optimize panel design. For

327

example, a panel consisting of diseases that meet at least three of the four ACOG severity

328

criteria (those in the profound, severe, and moderate categories, Table 1), have a carrier

329

frequency of at least one percent in any ethnicity (Ben-Shachar et al., 2019), and that can be

330

diagnosed prenatally would be made up of approximately 40 diseases, indicated by daggers in

331

Supplementary Table 1.

332
333

Limitations

334

This study has limitations that should be noted. First, the GC and MD participants were selected

335

to review the conditions because of their expertise in pediatrics and medical genetics, but their

336

application of the severity algorithm may not replicate application by other clinicians with similar

337

or different expertise. Second, the GC and MD participants may themselves have had biases in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014951; this version posted December 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this

338

categorization toward more or less severity. We attempted to account for potential biases using

339

permutation testing, and found no significant differences in categorization among the pairs.

340

Third, the MDs were not blinded to the final GC classifications, so it is possible that their

341

classification was influenced by that of the GC pair. However, this paradigm emulates clinical

342

practice, in which GCs (or other providers) routinely present initial findings to their provider

343

colleagues as the entire care team manages the patient. Fourth, genes were assessed based

344

on the available literature, which may skew toward more severe disease presentations,

345

particularly in the case of rare diseases. As understanding of phenotypes evolves, the

346

classifications may change. And finally, the framework used in this study to categorize severity

347

may itself have had limitations (Lazarin et al., 2014).

348
349

Conclusions

350

This study applied a systematic and transparent process to evaluate the severity of genes on a

351

commercially-available ECS panel by engaging with a diverse set of genetics providers with

352

expertise in rare disease. All but one gene were classified into profound, severe, or moderate

353

severity categories, all of which meet at least three of the four ACOG criteria for severity of

354

conditions to be included on an ECS panel. Severity classification, in addition to other factors

355

suggested by ACOG and community consensus, can be used by laboratories to consider genes

356

for inclusion on expanded carrier screening panels.
