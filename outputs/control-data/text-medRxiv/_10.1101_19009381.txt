Running title. PARP1/2 imaging with 18F-PARPi in head and neck cancer.
Keywords. 18F-PARPi; PARP1/2; PET/CT; Imaging; Head and neck cancer;
Translational Relevance. Preclinically, labeled PARP1-targeted olaparib derivatives have been
used to visualize several malignancies with high contrast, including head and neck cancer. These
results suggest that PARP1-targeted imaging agents could potentially be used as a quantitative
whole body imaging test for primary and metastatic lesions, improving diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity compared to the standard of care. This first-in-human study of 18F-PARP1 in patients
with head and neck cancer established that imaging with the olaparib-based PARP1 imaging
agent 18F-PARPi is feasible and safe, and that contrast ratios in the head and neck region are
comparable to 18F-FDG. Retention in tumors and metastatic nodes is longer than in physiological
tissues, including the salivary glands. The lymph node detection rate for 18F-PARPi is higher
than for 18F-FDG, and a subset of 18F-PARPi positive and 18F-FDG negative lymph nodes
resolved after chemoradiation. Further study of 18F-PARPi in head and neck cancer is being
pursued.

Abstract
Purpose. We performed a first-in-human clinical trial. The aim of this study was to determine
safety and feasibility of PET imaging with 18F-PARPi in patients with head and neck cancer.
Patients and Methods. Eleven patients (age 49 to 86 years) with newly diagnosed or recurrent oral
and oropharyngeal cancer were injected intravenously with

18

F-PARPi (331 ± 42 MBq) and

dynamic PET/CT imaging was performed between 0 min and 25 min post-injection. Static PET/CT
scans were obtained at 30 min, 60 min and 120 min p.i. Blood samples for tracer concentration
and metabolite analysis were collected. Blood pressure, ECG, oxygen levels, clinical chemistry
and CBC were obtained before and after administration of 18F-PARPi.
Results. 18F-PARPi was well-tolerated by all patients without any safety concerns. Of the 11
patients included in the analysis, 18F-PARPi had focal uptake in all primary lesions (n = 10, SUVmax
= 2.8 ± 1.2) and all 18F-FDG positive lymph nodes (n = 34). 18F-PARPi uptake was seen in 18FFDG negative lymph nodes of three patients (n = 6). Focal uptake of tracer in primary and
metastatic lesions was corroborated by CT alone or in combination with 18F-FDG. Contrast for
18

F-PARPi and 18F-FDG was comparable (SUVmax(lesion)/SUVmax(genioglossus) = 3.3 and 3.0,

respectively; p = 0.23), and SUVmax values for 18F-PARPi were less variable compared to 18F-FDG
(1.3 versus 6.0, p = 0.001).
Conclusions. Imaging of head and neck cancer with 18F-PARPi is feasible and safe. 18F-PARPi
detects primary and metastatic lesions, and retention in tumors is longer than in healthy tissues.

Introduction
Diagnosis and treatment of many malignant tumors have dramatically improved in recent decades,
and oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are no exception to this trend. However,
most patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma still present with advanced
disease and regional or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.
Presence of pathological regional lymph nodes is the most powerful and consistent predictor of
outcome for oral cancers (1), and the ability to accurately assign the exact extent of metastatic
spread within the neck lymphatic system is therefore of great significance (1,2). Complete surgical
removal of metastatic disease in the neck has a clear impact on prognosis, but it often remains
unclear until histopathological analysis is complete, if a lymph node was metastatic or not (3,4).
Clinical palpation of the neck is inadequate, as are the available non-invasive radiological
investigative tools. Many patients present with enlarged lymph nodes due to inflammation around
the tumor site. These inflamed lymph nodes may mimic neck metastases on CT scans and are often
18

F-FDG PET avid (5-8). On the other hand, some metastatic neck nodes may not be enlarged and

show no abnormal 18F-FDG uptake. For these reasons, elective neck dissection or irradiation are
often recommended in patients with head and neck cancer for prophylactic treatment of occult
metastases. Ideally, however, these procedures, which can lead to increased co-morbidities and
reduced quality of life due to overtreatment (9-11), would be avoided if the presence of occult
metastases could be definitively ruled out.
PARP1/2 PET imaging could provide a non-invasive solution for this unmet clinical need.
PARP1/2 is overexpressed in many malignancies, including oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (12,13), likely due to the enzyme’s central role in DNA repair (14,15). Several
radiolabeled PARP1/2 inhibitors were tested in preclinical studies (16,17), showing correlation of
uptake with PARP1 expression (18,19), and suggesting that imaging is possible with little
unspecific uptake in healthy head and neck tissue.
The purpose of this study was to clinically translate 18F-PARPi, a PARP1/2 inhibitor derived from
the core scaffold of olaparib (20), and to provide a first step toward validating the tracer as a
clinical tool. Other PARP inhibitor-based imaging agents, based on different core scaffolds, were
translated earlier (21-23). In this first-in-human phase I clinical trial in patients with oral and
oropharyngeal cancer, we determined the safety and pharmacokinetics of

18

F-PARPi, and

correlated its uptake in tumors and normal tissue to standard of care 18F-FDG imaging.

Patients and Methods
Study design.
This exploratory, phase I, single-center, open-label, prospective Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant study was approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering
(MSK) Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all patients
(Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03631017). The primary objectives of this phase I trial were to evaluate
the safety of 18F-PARPi, to describe the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry, and to describe
the tumor uptake of 18F-PARPi. Patients were accrued between January 2019 and September 2019
and referred to the MSK Molecular Imaging and Therapy Service for their newly diagnosed or
recurrent oral or oropharyngeal cancer. In total, 8 patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma and 3 patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma completed the protocol. All 11
patients were injected with 18F-PARPi and underwent imaging. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Radiopharmaceutical Preparation.
18

F-PARPi was produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions at the MSK

Radiopharmacy under IND# 139,974 similar to previously reported procedures (18-20,24).
Briefly, to obtain 18F-PARPi, cyclotron-produced [18F] was trapped on the QMA SEP pack, eluted
with 4 mg of tetraethylammonium bicarbonate into a reaction vial containing a teflon magnetic
stir bar, and dried by being heated at 90 °C under vacuum. Then, 2 mg of ethyl-4 nitrobenzoate,
dissolved in 0.2 mL DMSO, was added to the reaction vessel, and the reaction was heated to 150
°C for 15 minutes and allowed to cool before 50 μL of 1 M NaOH was added, followed by 50 μL
of 1 M HCl, yielding 4-[18F]fluorobenzoic acid. Thereafter, 4 mg of 4-(4-fluoro-3-(piperazine-1carbonyl)benzyl) phthalazin-1(2H)-one in 100 μL dry of DMSO were added followed by 10 mg
of HBTU dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO and 20 μL of Et3N. 18F-PARPi was isolated by preparatory
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with isocratic 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA
solution as mobile phase, Phenomenex; 6-Phenyl, 5 µm, 250 × 10 mm column as stationary phase
at a flow rate of 4.0 mL/min, and a UV detector wavelength of 254 nm. The HPLC system used
was a Shimadzu Prominence 20 Series, equipped with a UV detector and a Flow-Ram sodium
iodide radioactivity detector supplied by Lablogic, UK. The radiochemical purity range in the 18F-

PARPi manufactured batches was > 99% (n = 9) and the molar activity was 115 ± 48 GBq/μmol
(3.1 ± 1.3 Ci/μmol, n = 9).
Tracer formulation and quality control.
After radiochemical synthesis and purification, the HPLC fraction containing the drug substance
was collected at 35 ± 3 min into a pear-shaped glass flask, containing 40 mL of sterile water for
injection, USP. To remove the HPLC mobile phase solvents, the reaction mixture was loaded onto
a light C18 cartridge and washed with an additional 10 mL of sterile water. The drug substance
was then eluted from the C18 SEP Pak with 0.5 mL of ethanol, followed by 9.5 mL of normal
saline, through a 0.22 µm sterilizing filter into a sterile, apyrogenic, USP Type I glass vial, sealed
with a rubber septum and crimped with an aluminum crimp. The final drug product underwent
quality control testing prior to batch release for patient administration in accordance with
acceptance specifications for radiochemical purity, endotoxin content, sterilizing filter integrity,
pH, appearance, and radionuclide identity confirmation. Sterility testing was performed postrelease.
Procedures.
All patients underwent clinical examination, baseline vital signs, pulse oximetry, ECG and blood
tests (< 2 weeks prior to imaging). No fasting was required prior to 18F-PARPi imaging. On the
day of imaging, two IV catheters were placed in each forearm, one for injection of 18F-PARPi and
one for drawing of IV blood samples.

18

F-PARPi was administered to patients at an average

activity of 333 ± 44 MBq (9.0 ± 1.2 mCi) by intravenous bolus injection. The synthesis of 18FPARPi is summarized in Supplementary Figure S1. For the first six patients, a dynamic PET scan
(with the field of view including the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys) was acquired to study the
biodistribution and clearance of the tracer. For the subsequent five patients, the dynamic PET scan
was centered on the head and neck region. Immediately after the dynamic study, a static PET/CT
scan of the body (extending from skull vertex to upper thighs) was obtained (30 mins p.i.). Two
further static PET/CT scans were taken at approximately 60 min and 120 min post-injection. A
total of 5 blood samples (at approximately 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 90 min and 150 min p.i.) were
drawn to quantify blood pool activity and to study

18

F-PARPi metabolites. After imaging, vital

signs were obtained and an ECG performed, and blood samples were collected for hematology and

blood chemistry analysis). A follow-up phone interview (1–3 days after the imaging study) was
conducted to document any side effects occurring after completion of the imaging study.
Metabolite analysis.
Blood clearance measurements were performed as previously reported (25). Briefly, multiple
venous blood samples were obtained between 1 min and 150 min after intravenous injection of
18

F-PARPi. Activity in whole blood and plasma was measured in duplicate using a calibrated NaI

(Tl) Wallac Wizard 2480 automatic γ-counter (Perkin Elmer, Inc.). The measured activity
concentrations were converted to percentage injected activity per kilogram (%ID/kg). Metabolite
analysis of activity in plasma was performed by reversed-phase HPLC with in-line radiation (PosiRAM model 4, LabLogic) detection using a Kinetex Biphenyl column (Phenomenex, 150 × 4.6
mm; 5 µm particle size) and a mobile phase gradient of 10–75% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) in water
(0.1% TFA) over 20 minutes. Intact 18F-PARPi elutes at 16 minutes and a number of metabolites
elute from 7–8 minutes.
Dosimetry.
Absorbed radiation doses to normal tissues were estimated for the first 6 patients of the study,
based on dynamic and static PET/CT images. Activity concentration-time curves were generated
by analysis of VOIs generated for liver, kidney, spleen, cardiac blood pool, bone, lung, gallbladder
and urinary bladder. Red marrow activity concentration was assumed equal to that of blood. WB
activity-time curves, generated using the 4 points defined by the administered activity (time zero)
and the total activities in the three whole-body PET scans, were used to calculate monoexponential clearance half-times. The areas under activity concentration-time curves (AUC) were
estimated by trapezoidal integration with a terminal contribution calculated by extrapolation from
the last measured value using the shorter of apparent terminal clearance rate or physical decay.
Whole-organ AUCs were obtained by multiplying the activity concentration AUC by organ mass.
Baseline values of organ mass were taken from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)
phantoms of OLINDA/EXM® 2.0 (Hermes Medical Solutions, Sweden) representing standard
human. Organ masses were rescaled if body mass differed by more than 15% from the standard
value (73.7 kg for males; 56.9 kg for females). Organ residence times were derived by dividing
organ AUC values by administered activity. For urinary bladder contents, residence times were

estimated by the OLINDA/EXM 2.0 voiding bladder model based on the fraction of activity
clearing via urinary bladder, the mono-exponential whole-body biological half-time, and an
assumed voiding interval of 1 hour. Residence times for the remainder of body were derived by
subtracting all the individually estimated residence times from the whole-body residence time.
Absorbed radiation doses to the whole body and various organs were calculated using
OLINDA/EXM 2.0 with effective doses based on the tissue weighting factors of ICRP Report 103
(26).
PET/CT imaging and analysis.
All PET/CT images were obtained on a Discovery 710 PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare), using
low dose CT settings (10-80 mA, 120 kV) for CT images that were used for attenuation correction
and anatomic correlation. All studies were reviewed using the Hybrid Viewer display and analysis
application (Hermes Medical Solutions, Sweden).

18

F-PARPi PET/CT and

18

F-FDG PET/CT

studies were interpreted by two nuclear medicine physicians with at least 10 years of PET/CT
experience. Three-dimensional threshold-based volumetric regions of interest (VOI) were placed
in reference regions (bilateral submandibular gland, parotid gland, blood pool of neck,
contralateral posterior neck muscle, genioglossus, bone marrow, mediastinal blood pool,
myocardium, normal liver, renal cortex, and spleen) and over all sites of abnormal uptake in lymph
nodes, or soft-tissue lesions with reference to the PET/CT images. Abnormal 18F-PARPi and 18FFDG uptake was defined as outside physiologic sites (such as palatine tonsils or skeletal muscle)
and of intensity greater than regional background. Uptake of 18F-PARPi in the soft-tissue lesions
and lymph nodes was assessed by measuring the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax).
Statistics.
Uptake values are presented as mean ± standard-error, unless otherwise specified. Distribution of
uptake with 18F-PARPi and 18F-FDG (on lesions where both were available) were compared using
a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for paired data, while their variances were compared using a
Levene’s test. R version 3.6.0 was used for analysis.

Results
Patient population.
A total of 11 patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of
the oral cavity or oropharynx completed the study protocol. Table 1 lists the patient demographics
and key diagnostic parameters, including stage and lymph node status, and Figure 1 shows a
schematic overview of the study workflow. There were 10 males and one female, with a mean age
of 64 years. At the time of imaging, 8 patients had newly diagnosed disease (all with the primary
lesion in the oropharynx). The 3 patients that had recurrent disease at the time of imaging had
previously been diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Nodal involvement
(anatomically abnormal lymph nodes) was present in 9 out of the 11 patients, and disease stage
ranged from I to IVb (8th edition AJCC). 27% of patients (n = 3) were HPV-negative (all oral
cavity squamous cell carcinoma) and 73% were HPV-positive (all oropharyngeal cases). Six
patients were smokers (5 of them with more than a 10 pack/year smoking history and 1 of them
with less).
Radiotracer characteristics.
The radiochemical synthesis of 18F-PARPi was performed using a synthetic route similar to what
we have reported before (18-20,24). We first synthesized para-[18F]fluoro-benzoic acid as a
radiolabeled synthon before conjugation with the 1(2H)phthalazinone targeting group. The molar
activity was 115 ± 48 GBq/μmol. On average, patients were therefore injected with 290 pmol of
18

F-PARPi, 6.7 orders of magnitude lower than the bi-daily administered dose of olaparib (2 × 300

mg) and therefore unlikely to elicit a pharmacodynamic response.
Adverse events and metabolism.
All patients tolerated the injection of 18F-PARPi well, and no adverse events were recorded related
to the 18F-PARPi injection. One patient died within a 2-week window after completing the study,
and one patient experienced grade 1 mucositis over the tumor site, which resolved the following
day. The death was considered unrelated to the administered drug. The mucositis was considered
possible related to the administered drug. For all patients, clinical chemistry and hematology were
determined and an electrocardiogram was performed before and after the administration of 18F-

PARPi (Supplementary Table S2). While some patients presented with abnormal findings before
imaging, no clinically relevant changes were observed after radiotracer injection or at follow-up.
Biodistribution and dosimetry.
Maximum intensity projection PET images of a representative patient injected with

18

F-PARPi

(images obtained at 30 min, 60 min and 120 min p.i.) are shown in Figure 2A. At 120 min, uptake
in the primary tumor had an SUVmax of 4.1, whereas lymph nodes had and SUVmax of 3.6 (level
1), 2.6 (level 2) and 2.4 (level 3). Across the entire patient population, the average primary tumor
SUVmax was 2.8 ± 1.1 at 120 min. The primary routes of excretion were renal and hepatobiliary
with most of the tracer excreted renally. Activity in the renal cortex diminished over time (SUVmax
= 16 ± 8 at 30 min, 9 ± 4 at 60 min and 7 ± 5 at 120 min) with commensurate accumulation in the
urinary bladder. The maximal observed activity in the urinary bladder corresponded to 20-38% of
the total administered, typically at the 30-60 min scan times. Simultaneously a fraction of the tracer
(on average 5% of the total administered) was excreted via the hepatobiliary route with relatively
rapid passage through the liver (SUVmax = 7 ± 2 at 30 min, 6 ± 1 at 60 min, 4 ± 1 at 120 min),
typically high accumulation in the gallbladder (SUVmax = 130 ± 92 at 120 min) and subsequent
transit into the gut.
Absorbed radiation doses to normal tissues from 18F-PARPi were estimated based on the tracer
biodistribution of the first six patients. Key dosimetry data are plotted in Figure 2B, and the entire
dataset can be found in Supplementary Table S3. The effective dose of 18F-PARPi was 0.014 ±
0.002 mSv/MBq, calculated with ICRP103. The tissue compartments receiving the highest dose
levels were the gallbladder wall (0.14 ± 0.07 mGy/MBq) and urinary bladder wall (0.08 ± 0.02
mGy/MBq). Radiation doses to bone marrow (0.011 ± 0.002 mGy/MBq), kidney (0.033 ± 0.005
mGy/MBq) and liver (0.036 ± 0.007 mGy/MBq) were considerably lower. In a typical diagnostic
setting (280 MBq – 370 MBq 18F-PARPi injected intravenously), the effective radiation dose is
projected to be 3.9 mSv – 5.2 mSv.
PARP1 was highly expressed in both oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in our
patient population (Fig. 2C and D), corroborating earlier work (12,13).
Metabolism.
Research blood draws were obtained for 10 patients at five timepoints after tracer injection, activity

counted and metabolites analyzed (Fig. 3A). Using a 2-phase decay curve, we determined the
weighted blood half-life to be 4.2 min (Fig. 3B). Only small quantities of metabolites were detected
at 1 min and 5 min (99.2 ± 1.5% and 89.9 ± 11.4% 18F-PARPi, respectively, Fig. 3C). At 30 min,
and with decreasing blood pool concentration of the injected tracer, we detected a radiometabolite
with a retention time of 7-8 min (50.9 ± 11.5%). For patients with blood samples at 90 min (n = 2)
and 150 min (n = 1), increasing amounts of the metabolite were observed (58.8% and 72.1%,
respectively). When screening possible non-radioactive,

19

F-labeled degradation product

analogues, we found that 4-fluorophenyl(4λ2-piperazin-1-yl)methanone had a retention time which
was overlapping with the radiometabolite (tR = 7.80 min). The small molecule therefore
represented a likely component of the degradation pathway (Supplementary Fig. S2). This is
consistent with the available literature on olaparib degradation (27).
Organ residence time.
Investigating the specificity of 18F-PARPi, we looked at the residence times of the tracer in tumors,
metastatic nodes and healthy tissues (Fig. 4). In spleen and liver, which both express large
physiological amounts of PARP1 and PARP2 (28), initial uptake was high, followed by rapid
clearance over the 2-hour imaging period (SUVmax(spleen, 30 min) = 6.1 ± 1.3 and SUVmax(spleen,
120 min) = 2.2 ± 0.6, representing a 64% drop). Similarly, the SUVmax in bone marrow was high
in the 30 min PET/CT scan, but values declined by 53% between 30 mins and 120 mins.
Comparably fast clearance was found for physiologic structures within the head and neck region.
Uptake in the submandibular and parotid glands decreased by 57% and 56%, respectively
(SUVmax(submandibular, 30 min) = 3.6 ± 1.0 and SUVmax(parotid, 30 min) = 3.1 ± 0.6 ;
SUVmax(submandibular, 120 min) = 1.6 ± 0.4 and SUVmax(parotid, 120 min) = 1.4 ± 0.4). In
contrast, tracer retention in tumor and metastatic nodes was significantly longer, with SUVmax
values declining by just 13% for both primary and PET-avid lymph nodes (SUVmax(tumor, 30 min)
= 3.4 ± 0.8 and SUVmax(tumor, 120 min) = 3.0 ± 1.1; SUVmax(lymph node, 30 min) = 3.3 ± 1.3
and SUVmax(lymph node, 120 min) = 2.9 ± 1.1).
18

F-FDG and 18F-PARPi in primary tumor and normal neck tissues.

To determine if 18F-PARPi could be a relevant imaging tracer for the head and neck region, we
compared its retention with that of standard of care 18F-FDG (Figure 5). Visually, 18F-PARPi and

18

F-FDG appeared to have similar contrast ratios at 120 minutes post-injection (Fig. 5A and B).

For both imaging agents, uptake was corroborated with tumor outlines defined by standard of care
T1-weighted Gd-MRI imaging (Fig. 5C). Across the patient population,

18

F-FDG had higher

average tumor SUVmax values than 18F-PARPi, but SUVmax values for 18F-FDG decreased for level
2 and level 3 lymph nodes. A smaller decrease in SUVmax values was found for 18F-PARPi (66%
and 15% for 18F-PARPi and 18F-FDG, respectively, when grouping primary/level 1 lymph nodes
and level 2/level 3 lymph nodes; Fig. 5D). Interestingly, when comparing uptake ratios
(SUVmax(lesion)/SUVmax(genioglossus)), we found similar median values for

18

F-FDG and

18

F-

PARPi (median = 3.0 versus 3.3, p = 0.23), although the variance was less for 18F-PARPi than for
18

F-FDG (1.3 versus 6.0, p = 0.001, Fig. 5E and F).

18

F-FDG and 18F-PARPi uptake matched with respect to the presence and location of the primary

lesion. However, the two tracers had divergent uptake patterns in the lymphatic system (Fig. 6).
For 18F-FDG, 34 lymph nodes were PET-avid. For 18F-PARPi, we observed 40 18F-PARPi avid
lymph nodes. These 40 lymph nodes included all of the lymph nodes that were detected using 18FFDG. Due to protocol regulations, no biopsy material was available for the additional 6 lymph
nodes, however, a subset of them resolved after chemoradiation (Fig. 6A and B).

Discussion
Recently, PARP1/2-targeted agents have received considerable attention as imaging agents (16,29)
based on the ubiquitous and near-universal expression of PARP in many types of cancers, with the
promise to serve as an accurate sensor of malignancy where standard of care methods currently
fail. This is of particular interest for head and neck imaging, where clinicians face multiple
diagnostic obstacles, including the difficulty to correctly determine the extent of primary tumors
(3,4) and the presence of metastatic disease (5,6). PARP1 is highly expressed in oral and
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and the percentage of PARP1-positive tissue in a biopsy
specimen correlates with disease grade (13). Increased expression of PARP1 formed the
foundation for this first-in-human study. Here we show that 18F-PARPi imaging is safe and feasible
in a cohort of patients with biopsy-proven oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
PARP1/2-targeted 18F-PARPi uptake in primary lesions matched well with 18F-FDG uptake and
MRI data, and high contrast images could be collected as soon as 120 min after injection. Our data
further suggest that 18F-PARPi could have a higher detection rate of malignant lymph nodes and
perhaps less nonspecific uptake in the head and neck region when compared to 18F-FDG.
Radiation doses associated with

18

F-PARPi PET imaging were relatively low. The overall

equivalent dose was 3.9 mSv – 5.2 mSv, lower than that reported for 18F-FDG (8.1 ± 1.2 mSv,
(30)). This was in part due to the selective uptake of the tracer, paired with a short blood half-life
and fast clearance. 18F-PARPi rapidly cleared from the circulatory system and accumulated in the
urinary bladder and gallbladder following respective transit through the kidneys and liver. Kidney
activity levels fell by 53% and liver by 41% between 30 mins and 120 mins of imaging. The
gallbladder wall received the highest radiation dose, although with considerable variability (Fig.
2B) possibly due to the patients’ fasting status. Residence time in gallbladder, and hence radiation
dose to gallbladder wall, could possibly be reduced by administration of CCK, a drug commonly
used in clinical nuclear medicine practice (31). The urinary bladder wall received the secondhighest effective dose, and could possibly be reduced, if necessary, by frequent bladder emptying.
PARP1/2 is located in the nuclei of cells. Consequently, the cell membrane and nuclear membrane
permeability of 18F-PARPi has to be high, allowing both fast uptake of radiotracer and clearance
of unbound material for image contrast generation. This was seen in the submandibular lymph

nodes, where the SUVmax at 20-30 min was higher than in the primary tumor for 80% (n = 10
evaluable patients) of all patients (Fig. 4). Subsequently, the delivered activity in these healthy
tissues cleared quickly, whereas the activity persisted longer in tumor and metastatic nodes (Fig.
4B). At 120 minutes post-injection the situation had inverted, and none of the submandibular
lymph nodes showed activity higher than the primary tumor. Similar rapid clearance of radiotracer
was noted in other healthy organs, including the spleen, genioglossus muscles, parotid glands and
bone marrow. For future studies, imaging with PARP inhibitors after longer time intervals postinjection might yield further improved contrast ratios.
Our study has some limitations. Since this is a phase I study, we were unable to collect histological
data from a statistically meaningful number of biospecimen for both primary and metastatic sites.
Consequently, histologic diagnoses for cases where 18F-PARPi and 18F-FDG PET disagreed are
not available, and while our data suggests that the tumor detection rate of 18F-PARPi is higher than
the detection rate of

18

F-FDG, it remains unclear if sensitivity and specificity are improved.

Determining this – and consequently validating the clinical rationale for 18F-PARPi – will be the
focus of a phase II study.
In conclusion, we performed the first-in-human translation of

18

F-PARPi, a PARP1/2-targeted

1(2H)phthalazinone, and the first imaging of PARP1/2 in head and neck cancer. Administration
of 18F-PARPi was safe, and aside from a grade 1 mucositis, which was possibly related, no adverse
events were attributed to the tracer injection. 18F-PARPi is a promising new agent for the imaging
of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
