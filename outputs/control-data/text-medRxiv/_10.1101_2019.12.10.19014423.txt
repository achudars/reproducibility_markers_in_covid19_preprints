Abstract
Our aim was to demonstrate the first use of Optically Pumped
Magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG) in an epilepsy patient with unrestricted head
movement. Current clinical MEG uses a traditional SQUID system for recording MEG
signal, where sensors are cryogenically cooled and housed in a helmet in which the
patient’s head is fixed. Here we use a different type of sensor (OPM), which operates
at room temperature and can be placed directly on the patient’s scalp, permitting free
head movement. We performed two 30 minute OP-MEG recording sessions in a
patient with refractory focal epilepsy and compared these with clinical scalp EEG
performed earlier. OP-MEG was able to identify analogous interictal activity to scalp
EEG, and source localise this activity to an appropriate brain region. This is the first
application of OP-MEG in human epilepsy. Future directions include simultaneous
EEG/OP-MEG recording and prolonged OP-MEG telemetry.

Introduction
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that
gives a unique window into whole brain function. In the field of epilepsy, MEG has
been the source of much interest due to significant technical advantages it
possesses over the ‘gold standard’ non-invasive technique for functional recording;
scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Unlike EEG, the MEG signal is not affected by
the smearing effects of skull and scalp and has better immunity to muscle artefact,
both of which enable a greater ability to detect epileptic activity1. MEG has been
shown to provide useful additional information to EEG, which significantly contributes

to patient selection, focus localization and long-term seizure freedom after epilepsy
surgery2,3,4. However use of MEG in epilepsy thus far has been limited to the presurgical evaluation of patients with drug-refractory epilepsies. This is because
current clinical MEG uses an array of cryogenically-cooled sensors termed
superconducting quantum interference devices or SQUIDs, placed around the
head5,6, making MEG systems cumbersome and restrictive as sensor positions are
fixed in a limited selection of helmet sizes. Consequently, any motion of the head
relative to the sensors e.g. during a seizure, affects MEG signal quality in spite of
movement compensation algorithms applied to it7. This means that MEG recording
sessions are usually brief (1-2 hours) when compared to EEG telemetry that can last
several days.

Here we describe the first use of an optically pumped magnetometer (OP) MEG
system8 in a case of medically refractory focal epilepsy. OP-MEG utilises novel
quantum sensors (optically-pumped magnetometers or OPMs) that do not rely on
superconducting technology but on the transmission of laser light through a vapour
of spin-polarised rubidium atoms. The use of OPMs in epilepsy has already been
demonstrated in rodent models9. Crucially, OPM sensors can be worn directly on
the head, allowing the subject to move within a magnetically shielded environment
whilst being scanned. A recent OPM study showed sensory motor signals robust to
subject movement of 20cm8. In addition, as the magnetically sensitive volume within
the OPM sits just 6mm from the scalp surface by comparison to roughly 4cm in
cryogenic MEG, the magnetic field strengths measured due to cortical sources are
typically 4 times greater in adults10,11, since magnetic field strength decreases with

distance. The intrinsic noise level of the most recent OPMs is comparable to that
SQUIDs (~10ft/sqrt(Hz))8.

In this study we demonstrate, for the first time in humans, that interictal epileptiform
activity can be recorded using OPMs. The localization of this activity agrees with that
of other modalities. OP-MEG therefore promises a combination of high
spatiotemporal accuracy during brain recording (with minimal effects of motion or
muscle artefact) and practicality, with subjects able to move naturally during
recordings.

Case
Our test case was a 47-year-old woman who had Haemophilus meningitis
associated with status epilepticus aged 18 months. After a period of seizure
freedom, she developed focal seizures with loss of awareness, refractory to a
number of antiepileptic drugs, and she is currently experiencing up to 10 seizures a
day. Repeated diagnostic EEG demonstrated epileptic spikes, polyspikes, and spike
and wave patterns indicative of a right posterior quadrant focus for the epilepsy. MRI
demonstrated widespread parieto-occipital damage of cortex and white matter,
indicative of a previous ischaemic insult.

Method
Prior ethical approval for this study was granted by The Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency. Informed consent was obtained from the patient to

participate in the study. Band-pass filtering between 1 and 70Hz was applied to the
EEG and OP-MEG data. Prolonged EEG monitoring (5 days) was performed with a
MedTronic system with a 21-channel setup using the international 10-20 electrode
system and average reference montage. The patient subsequently underwent two
separate recording sessions using OP-MEG, each lasting 30 minutes. For both
recording sessions, we used remote reference sensors placed near the patient to
record, and eventually regress out, environmental magnetic noise. The first session
involved the patient lying on a bed with her head resting on a bespoke plinth, which
housed 8 first-generation OPMs (Figure 1A2, left) for recording brain activity and 6
sensors for reference measurement. The second session was performed with the
subject wearing a bespoke 3D-printed scanner-cast (Figure 1A1) to hold 15 secondgeneration OPMs (Figure 1A2, right). The scanner-cast design was informed by a
previously acquired anatomical 3 T MRI scan12. These casts provide a rigid sensor
mount with respect to the individual anatomy and ensures that any movement
artefacts are common across sensors. The positions of the sensors in relation to the
brain could be ascertained directly from the digital scanner cast design (Figure 1B).
Source reconstruction of an average of interictal spikes (manually identified by an
experienced neurophysiologist) was performed using dipole fitting within Fieldtrip
software (http://fieldtriptoolbox.org) (Figure 1D-F). We used the rising phase to
maximal peak of spike for reconstruction. Both recordings were performed within a
magnetically shielded room and with the subject sitting between two biplanar coils
separated by 1.5 metres, which were used to remove remnant static magnetic
fields13. This allowed the patient to move her head naturally whilst reclining in a
chair.

Results
During EEG telemetry the patient exhibited frequent interictal activity including sharp
waves, spikes and polyspikes, on average 30/hour (examples in Figure 1C). These
were maximal in channels T8 and Right Sphenoidal. She also had four seizures
heralded by right fronto-centro-temporal spikes and subsequent generalised
attenuation of EEG activity. During the two OP-MEG recording sessions, we were
able to identify the same interictal patterns, on average 21 spikes/30 minutes. The
patient suffered no seizures during OP-MEG recording. Using 19 spikes recorded in
one session, we localised the epileptiform activity to the previously EEG identified
abnormal right posterior quadrant, assumed to be the epileptogenic focus (Figure
1D). She since underwent resective surgery of this region with a reduction in her
seizure frequency.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated the first use of OP-MEG in an epilepsy patient with
unrestricted head movement. OP-MEG detected forms of abnormal interictal activity
seen on clinical EEG (spikes, polyspikes, spike and wave) demonstrating similar
morphology, and produced consistent localisation of spike activity. One limitation of
this study has been that EEG and OP-MEG were not acquired at the same time.
However, this study is an important proof of concept step in the use of OP-MEG for
epilepsy. Another limitation is that the OP-MEG sensors were concentrated around
the region of interest when recording; i.e. right posterior quadrant. Although this
introduces some bias as compared to whole head coverage, an inherent advantage
of MEG over EEG is overcoming this inverse problem of source localisation. Further

development of the technique will include simultaneous 30 channel OP-MEG and
EEG recording, which has already been demonstrated in healthy subjects14 and
prolonged EEG/OP-MEG recording over several hours with video monitoring. Work
is also underway in developing OP-MEG for children with refractory epilepsy where
motion tolerance is of even more importance. In addition, a new large OP-MEG
recording suite (3 x 4 metres) is being completed at Wellcome Centre for Human
Neuroimaging, UCL, with improved low frequency shielding to allow a larger area for
the patient to move in whilst recording. OP-MEG has the potential to improve the
quality of functional imaging within epilepsy diagnostics and finally translate MEG
into a readily clinically available tool.
