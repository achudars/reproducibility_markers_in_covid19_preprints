Abstract
Background
Dengue presents a wide clinical spectrum including asymptomatic dengue fever (DF) or severe forms,
such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Early symptoms of DHF
are similar to those of non-life-threatening DF. Severe symptoms manifest after 3-5 days of fever, which
can be life threatening due to lack of proper medications and inability to distinguish severe cases during
the early stages. Early prediction of severe dengue in patients with no warning signs who may later
develop severe infection is very important for proper disease management to alleviate DHF related
complications and mortality. Due to the role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and
remarkable stability of microRNA, altered expression of microRNA was evaluated to explore clinically
relevant biomarkers.
Methodology/Principal findings
The relative expression of microRNA hsa-let-7e, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-30e-3p, hsa-miR-33a, and
hsa-miR-150-5p and several putative target genes in peripheral blood cells (PBC) collected from 20 DF
and 20 DHF positive patients within four days from fever onset was evaluated by qRT-PCR. hsa-miR150-5p showed significant (P<0.05) up regulation in PBC of DHF patients compared to DF patients
during the acute phase of infection. Expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was significantly
(P<0.05) down regulated indicating that genes involved in epigenetic regulation are also differentially
expressed in DHF patients during the early stage of infection.
Conclusions/Significance
Differential expression of microRNA miR-150-5p and the putative target gene EZH2 may serve as
reliable biomarkers of disease severity during early stages of dengue infection.

Author summary

Severe dengue cannot be distinguished from dengue fever during the early stages of infection
based on the clinical symptoms. A diagnosis is only made after the patient is presented with
severe manifestations such as plasma leakage and hemorrhage. During a dengue outbreak, this
leads to high occupancy of hospital beds. However, only a small percentage of patients present
with severe symptoms and the others do not require medical care at a hospital. Therefore, early
prognosis of severe manifestations could reduce dengue related mortality by identifying the
patients who will benefit from hospitalization and early intervention. We demonstrate that severe
dengue in Sri Lankan patients is associated with increased expression of miRNA miR150 and
decreased expression of EZH2 during the early stages of infection when none of the patients
showed symptoms of developing severe manifestations at later stages of infection.
Introduction
More than half of the world population is at risk of contracting dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection
with approximately 50 to 100 million cases reported each year in many tropical countries including Sri
Lanka [1]. In 2018, 51659 suspected dengue cases have been reported to the Epidemiology Unit of Sri
Lanka from all over the island making it the most important tropical disease posing a significant public
health threat. Dengue fever (DF) is characterized by headache, retro orbital pain, body pain, nausea,
vomiting, joint pains and weakness [2]. Severe manifestations of dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) also show similar symptoms during the early stages of
infection. After 3-5 days from fever onset, DHF patients manifest plasma leakage, elevated hematocrit
and pleural effusions. Humans possessing pre-infection antibody, passively acquired or derived from
heterotypic infection are susceptible to DHF [3]. There are four dengue virus serotypes each of which is
capable of infection [4]. DENV1 and DENV2 have been reported as prevalent serotypes with a similar
number of reported infections [5]. All four virus serotypes are present in Sri Lanka. DENV2 and DENV3
are the common serotypes reported in many parts of Sri Lanka, with DENV3 reported to be responsible

for many of the infections that progress to DHF [6]. Inability to distinguish severe dengue from DF
during the early stages of infection makes this disease life threatening.
There are no proper medications or vaccines available for prevention and treatment of dengue [7].
The first ever dengue vaccination program was launched in 2016 in Philipines with complications rising
from increased risk of severe dengue in particular circumstances [1]. Therefore, dengue prevention is
largely limited to vector control. Several research groups have reported potential small molecules for drug
intervention of DF [8-10]. In addition, there is ongoing research on antiviral activity of phytochemicals as
well as currently available antiviral drugs against dengue viruses. However, these phytochemicals and
drugs have not been approved for the management of dengue infections [11,12]. Diagnostic tests based on
PCR or serological testing for dengue do not distinguish DHF from DF and disease severity is
determined after the patient is presented with severe symptoms [13]. However, if diagnosed early,
effective disease management only involves hospital care and hydration to mitigate complications from
severe dengue [14]. Since there are no early clinical tests approved for prognosis of severe dengue, most
patients suspected of having contracted dengue are hospitalized for disease management resulting in high
healthcare costs, though only a small fraction of DF patients develop DHF and DSS. Therefore,
identification of markers for the early detection of DHF could effectively cut down dengue related
mortality as well as cost of healthcare during dengue outbreaks.
Several studies comparing the transcriptomes of DF and DHF patients have reported increased
levels of cytokines, TNF-, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN- involved in host immune responses in
DHF patients [15-19]. Genetic varients in MICB and PLCE1 has been found to be associated with severe
dengue [20]. However, these studies have not determined whether these markers serve as differential
markers during the early stage of infection when severe manifestations of dengue cannot be distinguished
based on the clinical symptoms.
MicroRNA molecules are small non coding RNA molecules with the length around 20-22
nucleotides. Due to their role in regulating the expression of putative target genes, microRNA are

important for function of human cells. Therefore, microRNA show characteristic expression in different
diseases. Since microRNAs are also remarkably stable in blood, they are under investigation as potential
biomarkers. Recent studies have reported differential expression of microRNA in dengue patients and
infected cultured cells [21,22]. hsa-let-7e, hsa-miR-30b-5p and hsa-miR-33a have been found to
differentially express in dengue virus infected cultured cells [23]. Similarly, miR-30e-3p also express
differentially in dengue infected cultured cells [24]. miR-150 expression is upregulated in DENV infected
cultured cells within few hours of the infection [25]. Expression of miR150 is also found to be
significantly upregulated in DHF patients compared to DF patients [26]. However, the expression level of
miR-150 during the early stages of dengue infection, when prediction of disease outcome is not possible,
has not been conducted in patient samples to determine the potential to serve as an early indicator of
progression to severe dengue. Therefore, we evaluated the relative expression of microRNAs hsa-let-7e,
hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-30e-3p, hsa-miR-33a and hsa-miR-150-5p against the geometric mean of hsamiR-16-5p and hsa-miR-103a-3p as reference genes and their putative target genes in peripheral blood
cells from blood samples collected from dengue positive patients within four days of fever onset by qRTPCR.
let-7e and hsa-miR-150-5p have been connected to regulation of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2
(EZH2) expression [27]. In addition, miR-30b-5p has been shown to regulate DNA methyl transferase 3
alpha (DNMT3A) expression that can be used as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for cancer
[28]. DNMT3A has been found to regulate herpes simplex virus-1 propagation [29]. miR33a regulates the
expression of receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) and ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily A
member 1 (ABCA1) involved in lipid metabolism and transportation, thus, play a role in viral invasion.
miR-33a directly down regulates the expression of ABCA1 in cholesterol metabolism pathway and also
contributes to the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis by targeting RIP-140 [30]. There is
also evidence that DENV infection leads to an autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and
triglycerides to release free fatty acids which increases the cellular β-oxidation that generates ATP. These
processes are required for efficient DENV replication [31]. ABCA1 expression inhibits Hepatitis C virus

cell entry, acting on virus-host cell fusion [32]. Therefore, the relative expression of these putative target
genes of above microRNA, EZH2, ABCA1, DNMT3A, and RIP140 were evaluated against GAPDH as the
reference gene for their potential to serve as markers of early prognosis of severe dengue.

Methods
Ethics statement
Ethical clearance for patient sample collection was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of the
Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka (Reference number-P/119/07/2015).
Written patient consent was obtained prior to the sample collection. The patient consent form was
approved by the same ethics review committee.
Sample collection and processing
Patients presented with clinical symptoms of dengue viral infection according to WHO Dengue case
classification (fever, with two of the following criteria: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia,
rash, hemorrhagic manifestations with no plasma leakage, and following laboratory findings: leucopenia,
thrombocytopenia and rising haematocrit with no evidence of plasma loss) within 4 days from fever
onset who tested positive for onsite NS1 rapid test (SD Bio) were recruited for the study from the North
Colombo Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka with informed consent. Patients who later develop DHF were
determined according to the WHO guidelines; Fever and Hemorrhagic manifestation (positive tourniquet
test) with evidence of plasma leakage (portable bedside ultrasonogram), spontaneous bleeding, circulatory
failure, profound shock with undetectable BP and pulse, thrombocytopenia < 100 000 cells / mm3, and
HCT rise > 20% [2]. 2.5 ml EDTA blood samples were collected from patients within 4 days from fever
onset and transported and processed at 4 °C within 2 hrs from sample collection. Isolated peripheral blood
cells and saliva samples were stored at - 80 °C until sample analysis.
Quantitative Real-time PCR
MicroRNA primers were designed based on the miRbase database and gene specific human primers
against EZH2, DNMT3A, RIP140, ABCA1 and the reference gene, GAPDH were mined from previously

published literature (Tables S1 and S2). Primers for microRNA target genes, were designed using NCBI
primer picker to span exon-exon junctions. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells using
miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was
synthesized using the miScript II RT Kit with Hiflex buffer for polyadenylation of microRNA according
to product manual (Qiagen). Expression of both microRNA and mRNA target genes was quantified using
miScript SYBR Green PCR kit according to product manual (Qiagen). Each reaction was carried out in
triplicates in 20 μL reaction volume using StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Bio Systems). The
efficiency of amplification was above 80 % based on the standard curve analysis. No-template reactions
and melting curve analysis was used confirm specificity of target amplification.
Statistical Analysis
q-q plots and Shapiro-Wilk test were used to determine normality at a 95% confidence interval. For the
Shapiro-Wilk test P>0.05 was determined as normal distribution. The fold change of microRNA and
mRNA expression was calculated using the equation 2-ΔΔCq. A difference in expression based on log base
2, less than 0.5 was considered as downregulation and above 1.5 was considered as upregulation between
DF and DHF cases. Statistical significance for differentially expressed targets were determined using
independent t-test based on SEM of ∆Cq. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significantly different.
Logistic regression analysis for odds ratio, receiver operator characteristics, area under curve, specificity
and sensitivity was determined using IBM SPSS Statistics, 2013 version at a 95% confidence interval.
Sample sizes were calculated using G*Power 3.1.9.2 software at 95% confidence interval with a power of
80% for normally distributed samples using parametric test and skewed distributions using nonparametric
test.

was analyzed within four days from fever onset. The data were analyzed against the geometric mean of
hsa-miR103a-3p and hsa-miR-16-5p reported to have stable expression in peripheral blood cells during
infections. Patients were classified as dengue fever (DF) based on the clinical symptoms. Patients who
later developed DHF were classified based on evidence of plasma leakage (pleural effusions and ascites)
detected using a portable ultrasonogram. Twenty DF and 20 DHF samples were analyzed. Among them,
most of the subjects were male (77%), with a median age of 30 (18-60) while the female subjects had a
median age of 24 (19-60) years. At enrollment, there were no statistically significant differences in
median laboratory clinical parameters including platelet count, hematocrit level, AST and ALT levels in
patients who later developed DHF compared with DF (Table 1). Circulating AST and ALT levels were
not significantly different between these two groups throughout the course of infection (Table S3).
Therefore, DF patients could not be distinguished from the DHF patients during the acute phase of
infection based on the clinical characteristics.

collected on day 2 (nDF=2, nDHF =3) and day 4 (nDF=11, nDHF=5) from fever onset failed to show
differential expression (Fig 1a, Table S4). This may be due to limited number of samples available for
expression analysis collected within 2 days from fever onset. While both males and females showed
similar upregulation in expression of hsa-miR-150-5p in DHF patients within 4 days from fever onset,
this upregulation was not statistically significant (Fig 1b, Table S5). This may be due to the relatively low
number of female samples available for the analysis. The rest of the microRNA under investigation also
did not show significant differential expression in DHF patients over DF patients within 4 days from
fever onset (Fig 1a).

during the course of infection presented as log values to the base 2 based on ΔΔCq values against hsamiR-16-5p and hsa-miR-103a-3p, where a fold change >1.5 was considered as up regulation and < 0.5
considered as down regulation. * P<0.05 based on ΔCq ± SEM using independent t - test.
According to the WHO guidelines, a rapid progressive drop in platelet count below 100,000/mm3
and a rising [2]. hematocrit level above baseline (> 52% for male and >48% for female) is considered a
major risk factor for manifestation of severe dengue symptoms. Platelet count < 60,000 /mm3 is also
considered as a better cut off for severe dengue marker [33]. The patients recruited for the study did not
have hematocrit levels above the baseline. (Table S3). Therefore, we evaluated the differential expression
of microRNA between the patients with platelet count < 100,000/mm3 during the course of hospitalization
(n=31) and those who maintained a platelet count > 100,000/mm3 during the course of hospitalization (n=9)
as well as platelet count < 60,000 /mm3 (thrombocytopenia) (n=26) and >60,000 /mm3 (n=14) during the
course infection. hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-30e-3p, hsa-miR-33a, and hsa-miR-150-5p showed
upregulation (>1.5) of expression in patients with platelet count <100,000/mm3 (thrombocytopenia)
compared to those with platelet count > 100,000/mm3 while hsa-miR-30b-5p and hsa-miR-150-5p showed
upregulation (>1.5) in patients with platelet count < 60,000 /mm3 compared to those with platelet count >
60,000 /mm3 during the course of infection. However, these differences were not significant. (Fig 1c, Table
S6). Therefore, the microRNA under investigation did not serve as markers of severity of infection as
marked by thrombocytopenia during the acute phase of infection.
Logistic regression analysis for miR-150 expression based on ΔCq values was found to be
predictive of DHF within 4 days from fever on set with odds ratio of 0.76 (95%, CI ;0.58-0.99, P=0.04) and
within 3 days with odds ratio of 0.52 (95%, CI ;0.29-0.93, P=0.03) (Table S7). The area under the receiver

indicating that miR-150 may serve as an early marker for development of severe manifestations of dengue
within 4 days from fever onset (Table S8, Fig S1).
Differential expression analysis of putative target mRNA of the selected microRNA in Dengue
patients within four days from fever onset
MicroRNA suppress or inhibit the expression of putative target genes. As such, the upregulation of
microRNA expression may lead to the downregulation of the putative target gene expression. Therefore,
relative expression of putative target genes of the microRNA under investigation, EZH2, ABCA1,
DNMT3A and RIP140 were evaluated against the expression of GAPDH as a reference gene in DF (n=20)
patients who tested positive for NS1 antigen and those who later developed DHF (n=20) within four days
from fever onset.
All the data for the target gene expression were normally distributed. EZH2 expression showed
significant down regulation (P<0.05) in DHF patients within 4 days from fever onset compared to that in
DF patients. Evaluation of differential expression in DF and DHF samples from patients recruited day 3
(nDF=6, nDHF=12), day 4 (nDF=11, nDHF=5) and within 3 days (nDF=8, nDHF=15) from fever onset also showed
a downregulation in EZH2 expression. However, the downregulation in expression was only significant
(P<0.05) in samples from patients recruited on day 4 from fever onset (Fig 2a, Table S9). These findings
are consistent with upregulation of miR-150 in PBC of DHF patients compared to DF patients at the early
stages.

count >100,000/mm3 (n=9) and > 60,000/mm3 (n=14) during the course of infection. EZH2 showed
significant (P<0.05) downregulation within 4 days from fever onset in patients with platelet count
<100,000/mm3 (n=31) compared to those with platelet count > 100,000/mm3 (n=9) during the course of
infection suggesting a role for EZH2 in severe manifestation of dengue as marked by thrombocytopenia at
a platelet count cutoff of 100,000/mm3 (Fig 2b, Table S12). While EZH2 expression is also downregulated
among patients at a platelet count cutoff of 60,000, none of the putative target genes show significant
differential expression among the patients with platelet count <60,000/mm3 and >60,000/mm3 (Fig 2b,
Table S12).
Odds ratio for development of severe dengue marked by platelet count <100,000/mm3 based on
logistic regression analysis for EZH2 expression within 4 days from fever onset is 1.46 (95% CI ;1.002.12, P=0.05), AUC 0.82 with sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.60 (P=0.02) at ΔCq of 2.04 suggesting
that EZH2 may serve as an early marker of severe dengue marked by development of thrombocytopenia
during the course of infection (Tables S10 and S11).
Discussion
miR-150 is significantly upregulated (p<0.05) in DHF patients on day 3, within 3 days and within 4 days
from fever onset. Therefore, upregulation of miR-150 and the indirect effects of miR-150 on EZH2 may
have contributed to the downregulation of EZH2 expression. Although hsa-miR-150-5p showed significant
upregulation (P<0.05) in DHF samples within four days from fever onset, samples collected on day 4 did

not show significant differential expression among the DF and DHF patients. Therefore, day 3 may be a
better cutoff for utility of miR-150 expression as a prognsitic marker for severity of dengue infection.
Evaluating differential microRNA expression in a larger cohort of patient samples is needed to evaluate the
fluctuations in the level of microRNA from fever onset during the early stages of infection. Calculated
sample sizes are (nDF =15218, nDHF =22828) on day 2, (nDF =5, nDHF =9) on day 3, (nDF =1479, nDHF =665) on
day 4, (nDF =7 , nDHF =13) within 3 days, (nDF =35 , nDHF =35) within 4 days. Therefore, based on the calculated
sample sizes, sufficient number of samples have been analyzed to determine the ability of miR150 to serve
as an early biomarker of severity of infection in dengue patients on day 3.
Calculated sample size with 95% confidence interval and 80% power for biomarker validity of
EZH2 is 17 each for within 4 days from fever onset, nDF =10 and nDHF = 4 for 4 days and nDF =9 and nDHF
=12 for 3 days from fever onset indicating sufficient number of samples have been analyzed to determine
the ability of EZH2 to serve as an early biomarker of severity of infection in dengue patients. Significant
downregulation (P<0.05) of EZH2 within 4 days from fever onset may also serve as an early biomarker for
severe dengue marked by thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mm3) during the course of infection. The calculated
sample sizes for EZH2 to serve as a biomarker for severity of infection based on platelet count are
n>100,000/mm3 = 17, n<100,000/mm3 = 57, n>60,000/mm3 = 219, n<60,000/mm3 = 407, suggesting the
need for validation in a larger cohort of samples. Further studies in cultured cells may be needed to evaluate
the role of miR150 on EZH2 expression during severe dengue virus infections.
Regulation of miR-150 and EZH2 expression has also been linked to inducible Nitric Oxide
Synthase (iNOS or NOS2) activity where iNOS is indirectly regulated by miR-150. A study showed, that
infection of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) regulates the epigenetic changes at class
II transactivator (CIITA) promoter via induction of expression of iNOS/NO and miR-150 through the
recruitment of the transcription factor. According to our studies, differential expression analysis of iNOS
in DF and DHF patient samples collected on day 2, 3, 4, within 3 days and within 4 days from fever onset
showed downregulation in DHF patients as early as day 2 from fever onset and remained downregulated
[34].

let-7e, which has been reported to directly regulate EZH2 expression is only upregulated in DHF
patients on day 2 and day 4 from fever onset while the expression is downregulated on day 3. Calculated
sample sizes for the role of the microRNA under investigation as early biomarkers of severity of infection
based on the data from 20 DF and and 20 DHF samples within 4 days from fever onset are given in Tables
S13-S15. Differential expression of EZH2 as a result of upregulation of let-7e expression was implicated
in several viral infections including DENV2 infected PBMCs [35]. Inhibition of EZH2 expression repressed
the herpes simplex viral gene expression [36]. Therefore, further studies in dengue virus infected cultured
cells may be needed to evaluate the role of let-7e on the differential expression of EZH2 during severe
dengue virus infection.
Epigenetic modifications are hereditary DNA or histone modifications that do not change the DNA
sequence and affect transcriptional regulation. EZH2 is an epigenetic modifier that can catalyze the
methylation of histone H3 protein. miR-150 plays a critical role in epigenetic modifications involving
regulating EZH2 expression at CIITA promoter region during the M. bovis BCG infection [27]. Therefore,
epigenetic modifications may play a role in severe manifestation of dengue during secondary infections.
Differential expression of epigenetic modifiers such as EZH2 in patients marked by plasma leakage and/or
thrombocytopenia suggests that there is a role for epigenetic regulation in severe manifestations of dengue.
The polycomb group protein, EZH2 and DNMT3A are both involved in epigenetic regulation via DNA
methylation. Binding of DNMTs to several EZH2-repressed genes depends on the presence of EZH2. EZH2
serves as a recruitment platform for DNA methyltransferases [37]. Since both EZH2 and DNMT3A
participate in epigenetic modification mediated transcriptional regulation, differential expression analysis
in virus infected cultured cells is needed to further evaluate the role of DNMT3A in severe dengue.
Expression of ABCA1 and RIP140 implicated in lipid metabolism, a mechanism which has been shown to
play a role in viral infections on the other hand did not significantly change in patients with severe dengue
(Fig 2a) [32]. While several putative target genes of miR150 should be validated in a larger patient cohort
based on the calcuated sample sizes (Tables S16 and S17), our studies have shown that differential
expression of microRNA miR-150-5p and the putative target gene EZH2 may serve as reliable biomarkers
