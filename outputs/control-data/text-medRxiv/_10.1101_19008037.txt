Abstract

31

Given the subjective nature of conventional diagnostic methods for post-traumatic stress disorder

32

(PTSD), an objectively measurable biomarker is highly desirable. Macroscopic neural circuits

33

measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) has previously been shown to be indicative of

34

the PTSD phenotype and severity. In the present study, we employed a machine learning-based

35

classification framework using MEG neural synchrony to distinguish combat-related PTSD from

36

trauma-exposed controls. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the core classification

37

algorithm. A recursive random forest feature selection step was directly incorporated in the

38

nested SVM cross validation process (CV-SVM-rRF-FS) for identifying the most important

39

features for PTSD classification. For the five frequency bands tested, the nested CV-SVM-rRF-

40

FS analysis selected the minimum numbers of edges per frequency that could serve as a PTSD

41

signature and be used as the basis for SVM modelling. Many of the selected edges have been

42

reported previously to be core in PTSD pathophysiology, with frequency-specific patterns also

43

observed. Furthermore, the independent partial least squares discriminant analysis suggested low

44

bias in the nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS process. The final SVM models built with selected features

45

showed excellent PTSD classification performance (area-under-curve value up to 0.9).

46

Testament to its robustness when distinguishing individuals from a heavily-traumatised control

47

group, these developments for a classification model for PTSD also provide a comprehensive

48

machine learning-based computational framework for classifying other mental health challenges

49

using MEG connectome profiles.

Introduction
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a chronic psychological injury that is typically brought

53

about by experiencing or witnessing a life-threatening event (American Psychiatric Association,

54

1980; Yehuda et al., 2011). The consequences to PTSD include prolonged suffering, distress,

55

impaired quality of life and increased mortality (Kapfhammer, 2014). The disorder is a major

56

neuropsychiatric disorder among military personnel, with up to 17% of Canadian Armed Forces

57

members developing PTSD within the first-year post-deployment (Richardson et al., 2010). The

58

current gold standard for PTSD diagnosis is based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of

59

Mental Disorders 5th edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, these protocols

60

rely heavily on the subjective report of the patients and, given the stigma of a diagnosis in some

61

groups, or difficulty articulating their symptoms, a clear diagnosis can be difficult. As such, an

62

objective diagnosis platform is highly desirable.

63

One critical step of developing such a framework for PTSD is understanding its

64

psychophysiological and molecular pathology. The underlying neurobiological pathogenesis is

65

increasingly understood within the context of dysfunctional brain circuits (Rauch, Shin & Phelps,

66

2006). A mechanism that mediates communication and information processing within and

67

between brain circuits is neural oscillations and synchrony (Fries, 2015).

68

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can image these phenomena non-invasively, and has been used

69

as an effective research tool for exploring the neural activity associated with various

70

neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder,

71

mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and Alzheimer’s disease (Stam 2010; Vakorin et al., 2016;

72

Alamian et al., 2017; Koelewijn et al., 2019) as well as PTSD-related functional circuitry

73

(Badura-Brack et al., 2018a, 2018b; Dunkley et al., 2014; Mišić et al., 2016). At the group level,

74

neural synchrony can stratify those with PTSD from a heavily-traumatised, but otherwise

75

matched, control group (Misic et al., 2016), with hippocampal synchrony directly related to

76

symptom severity across individuals (Dunkley et al., 2014). This suggests synchrony might be a

77

reliable signature for PTSD identification.

78

Rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and machine learning have shown promise in

79

brain imaging and computational neuroscience. Various Bayesian inference-based machine

80

learning algorithms have been developed and implemented for neuroimaging signal processing

81

and temporal brain activity prediction (Wu et al., 2016). In translational research and clinical

82

applications, these methods are being actively explored for pre-symptomatic diagnosis,

83

prognostic prediction, and medical intervention effectiveness prediction (Rizk-Jackson et al.,

84

2011). Neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders like Huntington’s disease, mTBI

85

and bipolar disorder are among the examples with promising results (Rizk-Jackson et al., 2011;

86

Mitra et al., 2016; Librenza-Garcia et al., 2017).

87

The objective here was to implement a machine learning classification modelling

88

workflow for delineating individuals with PTSD from trauma-exposed, matched control

89

participants using MEG-derived functional connectomes based on neural synchrony. We

90

developed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline based on support vector machine (SVM)

91

and random forest (RF) algorithms, leveraging their classification modelling and feature

92

selection capabilities, respectively. We recruited combat-related PTSD and trauma-exposed

93

control participants from the Canadian Armed Forces, data that has been published in previous

94

studies (Dunkley et al., 2014; Mišić et al., 2016). This design builds upon our established work

95

and also takes advantage of the similar contexts of traumatic exposure and chronic stress present

96

across participants from serving in a military context, as compared with those from a civilian

97

setting. The present study tests the capacity of machine learning in differentiating PTSD from

98

traumatic-exposure and more generally the potential of this method in distinguishing other

99

mental health challenges.

Materials and methods
Details on the patient group demographics, data acquisition, and imaging analysis can be

103

found in Dunkley et al., 2014. What follows below in a summary statement. Additional

104

information regarding data collection, processing and machine learning analysis can be found in

105

Supporting Information S1. Data acquisition from the 2014 study (Dunkley et al., 2014) was

106

performed with the written informed consent of each individual and under the approval of the

107

Research Ethics Board at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids)

108

Participants

109

23 Canadian Armed Forces soldiers diagnosed with PTSD (all male, mean age = 37.4,

110

SD = 6.8, age range 22-48) were recruited and had 5 minutes of eyes open MEG resting state

111

data recorded. Twenty-one trauma-exposed peers (all male, mean age = 33.05, SD = 5.26, age

112

range 18-45) who did not develop PTSD were recruited as a control group.

113

Inclusion criteria for the PTSD group were: a diagnosis of combat-related PTSD; PTSD

114

symptoms were present from 1-4 years prior to participation in the study; they were engaged in

115

regular mental health follow-up; they had moderate or greater severity on the PTSD check list

116

(PCL>50). All participants in the PTSD group were recruited from one of the Canadian Armed

117

Forces (CAF) Operational and Trauma Stress Support Centres (OTSSC), which are centres of

118

excellence for the diagnosis and treatment of trauma-related mental health injuries. Additional

119

inclusion criteria applied to both groups included: no history of a traumatic brain injury (TBI),

120

screened by a psychiatrist through a review of their electronic health record, telephone interview,

121

and administration of the Defence and Veteran's Brain Injury Centre (DVBIC) 3 item screening

122

tool; English-speaking and able to understand task instructions and give informed consent.

123

Exclusion criteria included ferrous metal inside the body that might be classified as MRI

124

contraindications or items that might interfere with MEG data acquisition; presence of implanted

125

medical devices; seizures or other neurological disorders, or active substance abuse; certain

126

ongoing medications (anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and/or GABA antagonists) known to

127

directly or significantly influence electroencephalographic (EEG) findings. As this was a

128

naturalistic sample, however, all PTSD patients were on evidenced-based psychotropic

129

medication(s), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine

130

reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and Prazosin.

Magnetoencephalography

133

The details of MEG acquisition and analyses can be found in Dunkley et al., 2014;

134

briefly, we acquired 151 channel MEG on a CTF system at the Hospital for Sick Children. MEG

135

data were coregistered with an anatomical T1 MRI, and a beamformer was used to recover time

136

series from 90 regions of the Automated Anatomical Labelling atlas (AAL) (Tzourio-Mazoyer et

137

al., 2002). The weighted phase lag index (wPLI) was used to determine all pairwise

138

combinations of seed synchrony (Vinck et al., 2011), with wPLI varying between 0 and 1, and

139

used as the edge weight in the matrix. We tested canonical frequency ranges, included Theta (4-7

140

Hz), Alpha (8-14 Hz), Beta (15-30 Hz), Low Gamma (or L. Gamma, 30-80 Hz) and High

141

Gamma (or H. Gamma, 80-150 Hz). Evaluating multiple frequency ranges allowed us to test the

142

relative performance between the bands, predicting that those which showed the largest group

143

differences previously would provide the greatest accuracy in delineating individual cases here.

Machine learning downstream data analysis
A visual representation of the overall workflow for the downstream analysis can be

147

viewed in Fig. 1. The following core techniques are featured in the method: unsupervised

148

clustering analyses with hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA),

149

univariate statistical analysis, SVM-centric machine learning analysis, as well as partial least

150

squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Independent from the upcoming machine learning

151

analysis, a univariate analysis step was used to examine the group differences and identify the

152

functional edges with statistically significant changes in connectivity. Data with only significant

153

edges then subject to a machine learning feature selection and modelling process to identify

154

edges essential for classification and subsequently to build a classification model (Fig. 2).

155

Similar strategy has been reported elsewhere (Busac et al., 2008). Generally, based on SVM

156

modelling and the previously described recursive RF feature selection (rRF-FS) process (Zhang

157

et al., 2016), a nested cross-validation (CV) framework was used for feature selection (CV-

158

SVM-rRF-FS). Subsequently, data with the selected edges were used for the final SVM

159

classification modelling step. Moreover, PLS-DA was conducted as an independent verification

160

algorithm for the machine learning feature selection and modelling analysis.

168

Unsupervised clustering analyses were used at various points of the downstream analysis.

169

Specifically, hierarchical clustering was used to explore the grouping pattern in synchrony

170

between the participant groups, as well as between the edges; PCA was used to confirm the

171

functional profile grouping for PTSD and control groups, as well as evaluate data complexity.

172

The entire downstream data analysis and visualization pipelines were carried out using

173

our custom developed R packages via UNIX Bash scripting. Detailed description of each step in

174

Univariate analysis

178

A summary of the univariate analysis can be viewed in Table 1. The complete univariate

179

analysis along with clustering analysis results are included in Supporting Information S1 and

180

Table S1. Hierarchical clustering was conducted on the data with only the significant edges to

181

assess the clustering pattern upon univariate analysis feature reduction (Figs 3A, 3B and S3). In

182

general, reduced data showed improved group clustering results for the five frequency bands.

183

However, we also observed varying results corresponding to specific frequency bands.

184

Regarding the Alpha band (Fig. 3A), the clustering result grouped seven participants from the

185

control group into a major cluster, with the second major cluster containing the rest. Within the

186

second major cluster, most PTSD participants were grouped together. For H. Gamma band, with

187

an improved grouping pattern (Fig. 3B), the control group exhibited a higher-level of variance

188

than the PTSD group, where six control participants where included in the PTSD cluster.

189

Moreover, the reduced profile in the Theta band managed to mostly separate the PTSD

190

participants from control (Fig. S3A). As seen in Fig. S3B, the Beta band also showed

191

substantially improved PTSD and control group clustering with the reduced data where only two

192

PTSD participants were placed in the control group. For L. Gamma band (Fig. S3C), although

193

two clusters were identified mostly according to the participant groups, the first major cluster

194

only included five control participants, with the rest clustered with the PTSD group to form the

195

second major cluster.

Support vector machine analysis

198

Using feature-reduced data with only the significant edges identified in the univariate

199

analysis, nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS and classification modelling was carried out. SVM models

200

were trained with the randomly partitioned training set and based on the results from the nested

201

CV featuring rRF-FS. The final SVM models were evaluated by CV step during the modelling

202

process before assessed by the external test set (from the initial random data partitioning step).

203

ROC-AUC analysis with the external test set and permutation test with randomized sample label

204

for training set were used (Figs. 3C, 3D, S4, S5). The permutation test suggested that the

205

prediction accuracy of the original model was higher than all the permutation models, leading to

206

a permutation p value at 0.01 across the five frequency bands tested (Fig. S5). A summary of the

207

rRF-FS results can be viewed in Table 1; and the full list of nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS selected

208

edges can be viewed in Table 2. A complete description for SVM modelling results can be found

209

in Supporting Information S1 and Table S2.

210

Here we use Alpha and H. Gamma as examples to exhibit the FS and SVM modelling

211

results. For Alpha, the rRF-FS step nested CV process identified 14 edges as the most relevant

212

features for PTSD-control stratification, including edges between the right superior parietal lobe

213

and supramarginal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and middle temporal pole, as well as left

214

precentral gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. The final Alpha band SVM model

215

was then trained with 31 support vectors with an internal CV accuracy of 0.94. Upon evaluating

216

with external testing data, the AUC value for the Alpha band was 0.9 (Fig. 3C). For H. Gamma,

217

19 edges were selected by the rRF-FS step as the most important features, including edges

218

involving the left amygdala, left hippocampus and thalamus. The nested CV also led to a nested

219

CV accuracy of 0.78 ± 0.06. For the final model, 36 support vectors were used, leading to an

220

internal CV accuracy at 0.94. The AUC value was determined at 0.9 for H. Gamma band (Fig.

221

3D).

Principal component analysis
Serving as an unsupervised clustering and data complexity assessment tool, PCA was

234

conducted at various points of the downstream data analysis for the five frequency bands tested.

235

The results can be viewed in Figs. 4 and S6. For all five frequency bands, when using all edges,

236

PCA failed to separate the PTSD group from the control participants, whereas the feature-

237

reduced datasets showed substantially improved group clustering. Due to the reduced data

238

dimensionality for the feature-reduced data sets, the data complexity also decreased

239

considerably, which is demonstrated by the increase of the percentage variance explained by the

240

first two PCs in the PCA results.

Discussion
Due to the subjective nature of PTSD diagnostics, the overlap of PTSD symptoms with

262

other disorders (concussion, for example; Garber, Rusu & Zamorski, 2014), and the high

263

comorbidity of other diseased states, including anxiety and depression (Vun et al., 2018), an

264

objectively measurable signature for diagnosing PTSD is desirable. Such a platform may work in

265

concert with the conventional interview and questionnaire-based PTSD diagnostic methods for

266

increased accuracy and facilitating individualized medicine. Given the complexity and dynamic

267

repertoire of neural activity, additional qualifications for an optimal fingerprint include being

268

non-invasive, neurobiologically-informed, as well as high-throughput – this can be achieved by

269

leveraging functional neuroimaging in combination with machine learning and artificial

270

intelligence-inspired approaches.

271

We considered macroscopic neural circuits based on MEG synchrony as one fingerprint

272

source. Indeed, MEG has been used to understand human neurophysiology, including a wide

273

range of neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders, such as mTBI, Alzheimer’s

274

disease, depression and bipolar disorder (Vakorin et al., 2016; Alamian et al., 2017; Koelewijn et

275

al., 2019). Neural oscillations recovered using MEG are known to be dysfunctional in PTSD and

276

correlate with primary symptoms and secondary complaints in the disorder (Kolassa et al., 2007;

277

Dunkley et al., 2014; Mišić et al., 2016; Badura-Brack et al., 2018a, 2018b). Building on this, we

278

developed a comprehensive machine learning-based pipeline for downstream mining and

279

modelling of MEG data. We applied our pipeline to a dataset with over 4000 unique edges,

280

across a number of neurophysiological frequency ranges that are used for multiplexed

281

communication in the brain. It is also worth noting that the current study featured a traumatized

282

control group that had experienced similar combat-related stress as the PTSD cohort, which

283

speaks to the robustness of our machine learning classification framework.

284

First, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis conducted on all the edges showed

285

that the complete functional profiles failed to exhibit any grouping patterns across any of the

286

frequency bands. Moreover, the PCA results on the full dataset with all edges were found to be

287

in complete agreement with the hierarchical clustering analysis, where the score plot exhibited

288

substantial level of overlap among participants from the two groups. These results are at least

289

consistent with the similar life experience the participants with PTSD and control participants

290

had in their military training, deployment and experience of chronic stress and acute trauma

291

during frontline deployment - it is not surprising that the groups possess similar superficial

292

functional profiles in neural activity indexed by synchrony.

293

Severing as an initial feature reduction method, the univariate analysis substantially

294

reduced the data features for all the frequency bands, with and average number of remaining

295

296

number of significant edges fluctuated according to frequency band, showing frequency-specific

297

patterns. For example, L. Gamma band exhibited the least amount of significant edges,

298

suggesting that the PTSD functional profiles might contain more individual variance across the

299

two participant groups. H. Gamma included the largest number of significant edges, consistent

300

with our previous findings where substantial group difference in neural synchrony was identified

301

for the H. Gamma rhythm (Dunkley et al., 2014; Mišić et al., 2016).

302

Using the feature-reduced data, the hierarchical clustering and PCA results showed

303

drastically improved group clustering patterns. Specifically, hierarchical clustering exhibited

304

almost complete clustering for the two groups in Theta, Beta and L. Gamma. Even though the

305

Alpha and H. Gamma bands failed to exhibit similar results, the clustering analysis still saw a

306

clear trend of grouping the participants by diagnostic label. Despite the similarity of the complete

307

functional profiles when comparing the two groups, our parametric univariate analysis workflow

308

was able to capture the subtle differences between the two groups. Furthermore, the PCA results

309

suggested that, with the feature-reduced dataset, the two groups could be mostly separated on the

310

first PC. Naturally, the data complexity was also greatly reduced for the data with smaller

311

dimensionality. Consistent with the hierarchical clustering results, PCA also exhibited

312

frequency-specific patterns. Moreover, PCA showed the groups were separated on PC1, which

313

explained the most percentage data variance (around 20%), suggesting the patient/control

314

grouping was the most crucial variable differentiating the data.

315

The SVM machine learning modelling process was conducted for all five frequency

316

bands using the univariate feature-reduced data. Our 10-fold nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS process

317

produced a consensus edge list. This step further reduced the number of edges by more than 50%

318

across all five frequency bands (Table 1). Despite the substantial reduction in data

319

dimensionality, clustering performance stayed mostly unchanged from the univariate feature-

320

reduced data, as seen in the PCA results. This indicates that the current machine learning feature

321

selection strategy was capable of effectively reducing the dimensionality of the data while

322

preserving the information necessary to separate PTSD participants from the control group.

323

Moreover, the PLS-DA VIP (variable importance in projection) evaluation independently

324

confirmed the importance of the selected features. These suggests that our feature selection

325

process was subject to minimal bias.

326

Frequency-specific patterns were observed for the feature selection results. First, the

327

quantity of the selected edges followed a similar trend as the univariate analysis results, where

328

Beta and H. Gamma exhibited the most selected features, whereas the Theta and L. Gamma

329

bands showed the least. Moreover, based on the corresponding univariate analysis results, we

330

evaluated the directionality distribution for the CV-SVM-rRF-FS selected edges. For example,

331

Theta showed decreased synchrony for 10 out of 11 total selected edges when comparing the

332

PTSD group with controls. Interestingly, a previous study of ours revealed an increase in

333

synchrony in PTSD when compared to controls under the same frequency band, but in a task-

334

dependent manner, during a cognitive flexibility protocol (Dunkley et al., 2015). This suggests

335

the repertoire of neurophysiological activity in PTSD in this particular frequency channel is

336

highly dynamic and flexibly modulated by task. Whilst not examined here, it also suggests using

337

task-induced changes in neural synchrony might be ripe for use as features in machine learning

338

classification for mental illness, as this highly dynamic neural activity is essentially untapped in

339

resting state paradigms. In any case, the initial univariate analysis here revealed an equal number

340

of edges with significant increases and decreases in synchrony, whereas, in addition to

341

drastically reducing the number of edges, CV-SVM-rRF-FS selected more edges with decreased

342

connectivity. These confirmed that while the univariate feature reduction identified the edges

343

with statistical significance at the group level, machine learning was able to further select those

344

features that were most important for individual classification – the increase/decrease ratio

345

compared between the two approaches might not always and necessarily be consistent. Machine

346

learning approaches are ideally suited to recover this granularity. Additionally, the L. Gamma

347

results were mostly consistent with previously reported overall decreases in a range of metrics in

348

the gamma frequency band observed from EEG, such as frontal nodal connection strength and

349

communication efficiency (Lee et al., 2014).

350

The completely data-driven nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS process was able to extract

351

information that is in line with our knowledge of the neurobiology of PTSD. For example, Theta

352

activity involving the right middle frontal gyrus were among the selected edges with decreased

353

synchrony, including those synchronising with the left insula and right postcentral gyrus. For

354

Alpha, edges involving the right superior parietal lobe and right supramarginal gyrus, left middle

355

temporal gyrus and left middle temporal pole, as well as left precentral gyrus and left inferior

356

frontal gyrus pars triangularis were among the top features differentiating PTSD and controls –

357

other studies have previously reported dysfunction involving the superior parietal lobe, middle

358

temporal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus (Sartory et al., 2013). Additionally, decreased

359

synchrony between the amygdala and fusiform was found to be important for PTSD

360

classification, in line with work from Stevens and colleagues where the weakened coupling

361

between the amygdala and the prefrontal regions was also observed in PTSD conditions (Stevens

362

et al., 2013). L. Gamma synchrony between the left hippocampus and right middle temporal pole

363

also proved to be an important feature, consistent with our previous findings where MEG hyper-

364

synchrony was observed at the group-level for PTSD (Dunkley et al., 2014). Additionally,

365

decreased synchrony between the thalamus and lingual gyrus across multiple frequencies might

366

be related to previously reported findings reporting structural changes in these regions in PTSD

367

(Tan et al., 2013). Taken together, PTSD status was identified using our MEG-derived

368

synchrony and our nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS workflow, highlighting its potential as an

369

application in this disorder and other neuropsychiatric disease, as well as a tool for hypothesis-

370

generation and mechanistic exploration in MEG studies more generally.

371

Ultimately, a final SVM classification model was built using the CV-SVM-rRF-FS

372

selected data. For the five frequency bands tested, the resulted final SVM models were

373

significant in classifying individuals with PTSD against the trauma-exposed controls according

374

to the permutation tests using the training set. Using the independent test data set, the

375

classification performance showed AUC values over 0.8 for all five frequency bands, suggesting

376

excellent classification accuracy. Notably, Alpha and H. Gamma bands exhibited AUC value of

377

0.9. Such results were consistent with the previous studies where the Alpha and gamma activity

378

were associated with PTSD in EEG (Clancy et al., 2017; Moon et al., 2018). Additionally, the

379

classification capacity of the selected edges was independently tested using PLS-DA modelling.

380

The results suggested that the high classification capability of the selected edges shown with the

381

SVM modelling also manifest by the PLS-DA modelling, thus considered universal regardless of

382

the classification method.

383

Not withstanding the limitation of a small sample size in the context of machine learning-

384

based data mining, the present study demonstrated the utility of a comprehensive machine

385

learning pipeline for PTSD classification based off MEG-derived signatures. In summary, the

386

univariate analysis successfully reduced the data size and considerably improved group

387

clustering capacity. The subsequent nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS analysis selected the minimal

388

number of biologically-relevant features that could serve as potential PTSD signatures and be

389

used as the basis for SVM modelling. All final SVM models were significant in classification

390

and exhibited high prediction accuracy, seen by the permutation test and ROC-AUC analysis

391

results, respectively. Furthermore, PLS-DA VIP analysis suggested low method-derived bias for

392

the nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS results. Taken together, the current study not only developed a

393

potential neural circuit marker and an associated classification model for PTSD – it should be

394

remembered this was tested against control participants who themselves were heavily

395

traumatised, some with sub-threshold PTSD symptoms - but also described a machine learning-

396

based computational framework for MEG neural circuit fingerprint discovery and development

397

that could potentially be rolled out to myriad other neuropsychiatric disease.
