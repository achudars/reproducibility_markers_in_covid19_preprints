Abstract

10

In the wake of the Rohingya population’s mass migration from Myanmar, one of the world’s largest

11

refugee settlements was constructed in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900,000 new

12

refugees. Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many

13

population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among

14

the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological

15

parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness

16

of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent

17

outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of

18

the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance

19

of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low

20

vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.

23

Since violence in Myanmar intensified in August 2017, nearly 900,000 Rohingya refugees have migrated from the

24

Rakhine State of Myanmar and settled in refugee settlements in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh [1]. Mass population

25

displacement has been connected to adverse public health outcomes due to a plethora of risk factors, including

26

heightened insecurity, reduced healthcare access, and inadequate living conditions [2]. Despite global gains in reducing

27

the burden of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases [3], low vaccination coverage rates and overcrowding conditions

28

in refugee camps often give rise to large-scale outbreaks in these settings [4–8] .

Background

29

Given the crowded conditions in the refugee camps and the low rates of measles immunization among the Rohingya

30

population, a large measles outbreak broke out in the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar in late 2017, with over

31

2,500 cumulative suspected cases of measles reported from September to December 2017 [9–11]. Measles is a highly

32

contagious respiratory infection caused by a paramyxovirus [12]. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets

33

or direct contact with secretions from the nose or throat of infected individuals [13]. Two vaccination campaigns

34

were conducted in response to the outbreak; the first campaign ran from September 16, 2017 to October 4, 2017 and

35

delivered the measles and rubella (MR) vaccine to 135,519 children aged 6 months to 15 years old [14]. A second

36

vaccination campaign ran from November 18, 2017 to December 2, 2017 and vaccinated 323,940 children in the same

37

age group [15].

38

We first evaluate the success of these vaccination campaigns in curbing the measles outbreak in the camps, by

39

quantifying changes in the effective reproductive number (Re ) and estimating the number of cases averted. Our

40

results highlight the success of the reactive vaccination campaigns—a remarkable public health achievement given

41

the very low rates of prior immunization among the Rohingya population.

42

We find that although these campaigns achieved high coverage, future measles outbreaks are still likely. First, the

43

Rohingya population has historically low vaccination coverage rates; a survey conducted in March 2018 found that

44

42.9% of children under the age of four had not received even a single dose of an injectable vaccine in Myanmar, and

45

only 2.8% of them had received five or more doses [16]. Second, the birth rate among the refugee population is high,

46

which rapidly replenishes the susceptible population. UNICEF estimates that approximately 60 Rohingya babies

47

were born in Cox’s Bazar each day in the nine months following the initial wave of migration in August 2017 [17].

48

We use a mathematical model to estimate the potential for subsequent measles outbreaks under different vaccination

49

coverage scenarios. Our findings have important public health implications, as greater understanding of the dynamics

50

of measles in Cox’s Bazar can help inform future resource prioritization and vaccination targets.

51

52

Daily case data was obtained from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) reported cases of measles and rubella in

53

Cox’s Bazar from September 6, 2017 to November 25, 2017 [9]. The data include 1,708 confirmed and suspected cases

54

of measles and rubella during this time period. All suspected cases are included in this analysis given the disease’s

55

characteristic rash [12], which facilitates syndromic reporting of measles. During an early blood sampling of 89

56

suspected cases of measles during the outbreak, only 1% of samples tested positive for rubella-specific immunoglobulin

57

M (IgM) [9]. The suspected cases are therefore assumed to be measles rather than rubella. We also assume that

58

all suspected cases occurred among the refugee population given the WHO’s finding that only 1% of cases occurred

59

among the host community population [9].

60

2.1

61

We first estimated the daily effective reproductive number for the measles outbreak, in order to estimate the basic

62

reproductive number—a key epidemiological parameter. The basic reproductive number is defined as the expected

63

number of secondary cases from a typical infectious case in a completely susceptible host population [18]. The

64

reproductive number quantifies the transmissibility of an infection, thereby informing key attributes such as the herd

65

immunity threshold.

Methods

Estimation of Re

66

We estimated the effective reproductive number at time t using the approach developed by Wallinga and Teunis

67

[19], where knowledge of the serial interval distribution and incident cases is used in a likelihood-based estimation

68

procedure that considers pairs of cases. The serial interval distribution of measles used in this analysis was based on

69

a meta-analysis of existing studies of measles, and was assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 11.9 days

70

and standard deviation of 2.6 days [20]. Table 1 reports all parameters used in this analysis and their sources. The

71

EpiEstim package in R was used to estimate the daily effective reproductive number over the course of the outbreak.

72

The 95% credible intervals were estimated using 1,000 simulations and 14-day time windows to increase precision in

73

estimates of the daily effective reproductive number [21].

74

2.2

75

Based on our estimated Re , we estimated the basic reproductive number, R0 , in order to simulate the dynamics

76

of measles using a mechanistic transmission model. To account for uncertainty at the start of outbreak, we used a

77

range of effective reproductive numbers, Re to estimate R0 according to the relationship Re = R0 ∗ s0 , where s0 is

79

at the start of the epidemic. The Re range was chosen based on when the epidemic curve suggests the measles

80

outbreak took off. Effective reproductive numbers between 1.4 and 3.1 correspond to values calculated using 14-day

81

intervals that start between days 6 and 16 into the outbreak. Here, we assume mass-action and that the population

82

is well-mixed [18]. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was used to capture uncertainty around parameter estimates by

83

efficiently sampling from the joint distribution of parameter inputs [27]. Using this method, 1,000 values of s0 and Re

84

were sampled from their assumed probability distributions (Table 1). A gamma distribution was fit to the resultant

85

1,000 estimated values of R0 . The median and 2.5% and 97.5% percentile of the reproductive number are reported,

86

and a histogram of estimated values is shown to reflect estimates based on the LHS procedure (Supplementary Figure

A deterministic, Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which incorporates birth and death rates, was

89

used to model the size of measles outbreaks in the refugee camps under the scenario in which reactive vaccination

90

had not been implemented in 2017 and under different vaccination scenarios for the next outbreak (Figure 1). The

model assumes random mixing in the population and does not consider age-dependent heterogeneity in transmission

Figure 1: Schematic representation of disease states in a model of a measles outbreak in Cox’s Bazar.
Individuals are either susceptible to measles (S), infectious with measles (I), or recovered from and immune
to measles infection (R), either due natural immunity from infection or prior vaccination. β represents the
transmission coefficient, γ is the recovery rate, and µ is the birth and death rate. The model starts with one
infected (and infectious) measles case (i.e., I(0) = 1). The number of recovered individuals at time = 0 was
calculated as R(0) = N − S(0) − I(0). The model tracks the number of individuals that move between the
compartments each day and is run for one year using the ordinary differential equations 1-3.
93

The transmission coefficient, β, was estimated according to the relationship β = R0 /N D, where N is the total

94

population (i.e., S + I + R) and D is the average duration of infectiousness (Table 1). A measles-specific death

95

rate was not included in the model since it was assumed to be negligible, as there were only 3 measles-attributed

96

deaths from August 25, 2017 to December 9, 2017 [15,29]. Immunity from both natural infection and vaccination was

97

assumed to be life-long. Two doses of the MMR vaccine have been shown to confer immunity for at least 20 years [30].

98

The model uses one infected case as the initial value for the number of individuals in the infected compartment, I(0).

99

The initial value for the recovered compartment was calculated as R(0) = N − S(0) − I(0).

Estimating the Impact of Vaccination on the 2017 Outbreak

101

The population included in this analysis was the 579,661 Rohingya that migrated to Cox’s Bazar after August 25,

102

2017 and settled in the refugee camps [23]. The proportion of the population that was estimated to be susceptible

103

at the start of the outbreak, s0 , was estimated by considering prior vaccination rates and the age distribution of the

104

Rohingya population (Table 1). The model runs for 365 days to reflect one year following the start of the outbreak.

105

LHS was used to take into account uncertainty in parameter estimates; 1,000 values for each parameter were sampled

106

from the assumed parameter probability distributions (Table 1). A histogram of values for the estimated final size of

107

the 2017 epidemic in the absence of vaccination is shown to reflect uncertainty in estimates (Supplementary Figure

2.2.2

Modeling the Impact of Vaccination on the Next Outbreak

To model the impact of vaccination on subsequent measles epidemics, we assumed a total Rohingya population size
of 870,534 as of April 2019 [1]. The SIR model described above (Figure 1) was used to estimate the size of subsequent
epidemics based on varying assumptions for vaccination coverage rates. The model incorporates infection rates during
the 2017 outbreak and the vaccination coverage rates of the campaigns conducted in 2017 by reducing the proportion
of the population that is susceptible (s) through the formula previously described by Gastañaduy et al. (2018) [31]
s = V C (1 − V E ) + sU (1 − V C )

(4)

110

where VC is ≥ 1 dose coverage of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, VE is the median effectiveness

111

of 1 dose of MMR vaccine (94%) [26], and sU is the proportion of unvaccinated individuals who are susceptible. This

112

approach assumes vaccination is implemented as one-time interventions between the end of the 2017 outbreak and

113

now. Table 1 reports all parameters and calculations used as inputs in the mathematical model. LHS was again used

114

to take into account uncertainty in parameter estimates.

115

For this analysis, the SIR model was run for two years to estimate the impact of vaccination on the next outbreak.

116

The cumulative number of cases over two years was calculated for vaccination coverage rates of 10%, 50%, and 90% of

117

the at-risk population. Cumulative cases were estimated as the cumulative proportion of the population that moves

118

into the infectious compartment in the SIR framework. Distributions of our estimates for the cumulative number of

119

cases at two years under the different vaccination rate scenarios are presented. To contrast these results with the

120

scenario of the next measles outbreak in the absence of vaccination, the same model used to estimate the size of the

121

2017 outbreak in the absence of vaccination was used with two changes: 1) the total population size was increased to

122

870,534 [1], and 2) the proportion of the population that was assumed to be susceptible at the start of the outbreak

123

was estimated as su instead of s0 (Table 1) to incorporate the two vaccination campaigns conducted in 2017 and

124

births that have occurred since December 2017.

127

During the 2017 measles outbreak in Cox’s Bazar, the total number of measles cases from September 6, 2017 to

128

November 25, 2017 was 1,708. The number of reported measles cases reached a peak of 86 incident cases on November

129

18, 2017, followed by a decline in cases (Figure 2A). Current measles transmission appears to be ongoing but limited

130

in the refugee camps, with 323 suspected cases reported from January 1, 2019 to May 4, 2019 [32].

Results
Quantifying changes to Re

131

The daily effective reproductive number ranged from approximately 1.4 (2.5% percentile 1.1 to 97.5% percentile

132

1.7) at the end of the third week of the outbreak to a maximum of 4.3 (2.5% percentile 4.0 to 97.5% percentile 4.8)

133

at the end of the fifth week, or the week ending on October 10, 2017 (Figure 2B). The first measles vaccination

134

campaign conducted in response to the outbreak appears to have been highly successful in curbing the transmission

135

of measles, as the daily effective reproductive number declined shortly after the end of the two-week campaign. The

136

second vaccination campaign, meanwhile, was conducted starting in December, when the daily effective reproductive

137

number was already below 1. By the middle of the 11th week, or mid-November, the effective reproductive number

138

had already dipped below 1. After restricting the maximum estimated basic reproductive number to 20 based on the

139

ranges for R0 commonly reported in the literature [33], the median basic reproductive number is estimated to be 13.7

140

with a standard deviation of 3.3 (Supplementary Figure 1).

141

3.2

142

If the two vaccination campaigns had not been implemented in response to the 2017 outbreak, our model estimates

143

a median final epidemic size of approximately 79,404 measles cases (standard deviation (sd) of 29,073). This result

144

reflects the high transmissibility of measles, and suggests that after one year from one infectious individual entering

145

the Rohingya population in September 2017, in the absence of interventions, almost all susceptible individuals—or

146

equivalently, approximately 14% of the total population—would have contracted measles. Considering that our model

147

therefore indicates a near 100% attack rate among the susceptible population, the fact that only approximately 2,500

148

cumulative cases occurred from September to the end of December 2017 is a testament to the tremendous success of the

149

vaccination campaigns that were implemented by the WHO, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health, Family and Welfare

150

(MoHFW), and their partners in response to the measles outbreak [9–11]. Our results suggest that nearly 77,000 cases

151

were averted as a result of the reactive vaccination campaigns conducted in late 2017 (Figure 3). The swift response

152

of WHO, the MoHFW, and partner organizations, considering the challenging circumstances of accommodating over

153

650,000 new arrivals by December 2017, is a remarkable public health achievement [34].

3.3

Modeling the Impact of Vaccination on the Next Outbreak

155

When our model is applied to the current population size under different vaccination scenarios, the model estimates

156

that the median number of measles cases after two years would range from approximately 74,500 cases if 90% of

157

the population is vaccinated to 90,000 cases under the scenario of a 10% vaccination coverage rate (Figure 4A).

158

These results contrast with the larger median estimate of approximately 93,700 cases, or 11% of the total Rohingya

159

population, predicted for the next measles outbreak in this setting under the scenario of no vaccination (Supplementary

160

Figure 3). Vaccination therefore has the potential to avert between approximately 4,000 and 19,000 cases over two

161

years depending on the coverage rate. Figure 4B shows estimates in terms of boxplots to reflect the uncertainty in

162

our model’s results due to parameter uncertainty.

163

164

Our analysis highlights the immense success of the two large-scale vaccination campaigns in averting measles cases

165

during the 2017 outbreak in Cox’s Bazar and supports the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage

166

rates in the population going forward. Our findings on the estimate of the basic reproductive number in this setting

167

(median = 13.7; sd = 3.3) are in line with previous estimates reported in the literature [33].

Discussion

168

We find that nearly 77,000 cases were averted over the course of one year due to vaccination in the 2017 outbreak.

169

The daily effective reproductive number declined from its maximum value of 4.3 at the end of week 5 to below 1 by

170

the middle of week 11. When we apply our model to estimate the impact of vaccination on subsequent outbreaks,

171

depending on the coverage rate in the population, vaccination could avert between 4,000 and 19,000 cases over two

172

years. The near 100% attack rate found among susceptibles in the absence of vaccination reinforces the importance

173

of maintaining vaccination as a key public health priority among the Rohingya community in Cox’s Bazar.

174

Our study has several important limitations. The estimate for the basic reproductive number may be biased due

175

to two possible ways in which the serial interval distribution from the literature may overestimate the serial interval

176

distribution in this specific setting. First, it is possible that other intervention measures such as contact tracing and

177

isolation of infectious cases were implemented during the outbreak, which would have the effect of shortening the

178

serial interval for such individuals. However, press articles or WHO reports do not mention these interventions, and

179

it may be reasonable to assume that these interventions were not widely used given their infeasibility in this setting.

180

Secondly, the contraction of the serial interval described by Kenah, Lipsitch, and Robins [35] in high transmission

181

settings is not considered in this analysis. Instead, a constant serial interval distribution is assumed. For these reasons,

182

the serial interval used in this analysis may represent an overestimation of the actual serial interval in this setting,

183

which would result in an overestimation of the basic reproductive number given the positive correlation between the

184

two measures. Future analyses could examine how the effective reproductive number at time t would change if a

185

hazard-based estimator described by Kenah, Lipsitch, and Robins [35] was instead used in order to address potential

186

serial interval contraction.

187

Second, reporting rates and how these rates changed over time are also not considered in this analysis. One

188

possible scenario is that identification of measles was worse at the start of the epidemic relative to later in the

189

epidemic, and that fewer measles cases were therefore reported in the early phase of the epidemic. If this were the

190

case, the initial case counts may underestimate the true extent of measles transmission at the start of the epidemic,

191

which would affect the calculation for the reproductive number. Assumptions about changes in the reporting rate

192

could be incorporated in future work, such that the reported daily cases are inflated by a different fraction across

193

time, for example using a method similar to that used by White et al. [36] in their investigation of the 2009 H1N1

194

pandemic .

195

Third, our results pertain to a specific outbreak among the Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar and may not

196

generalize to other populations. Importantly, our assumption of homogeneous mixing may not hold in other settings.

197

Despite these limitations, this analysis provides estimates for the transmissibility of measles in the setting of

198

Cox’s Bazar as well as quantifies the impact of vaccination. Starting in December 2017, the WHO and its partners

199

implemented MR vaccination at border check points [37]. From February to December 2018, approximately 29,000

200

MR doses were delivered to children [38]. The WHO currently supports the Ministry of Health in routine measles

201

surveillance [39]. These efforts are highly commendable and should be recognized.

202

Importantly, however, our findings emphasize the necessity of maintaining ongoing surveillance and of consistently

203

implementing preventive interventions like vaccination. Recently, attention in the refugee camps has been focused

204

primarily on diarrheal diseases in Cox’s Bazar [40]. At the same time, according to the WHO’s Early Warning, Alert,

205

and Response System (EWARS) in Cox’s Bazar, approximately 10 to 20 cases of suspected measles or rubella have

206

been reported to EWARS each week since the start of 2019, signaling ongoing measles transmission [41].

207

Against this backdrop of competing public health concerns, it will be important to sustain routine vaccination

208

of vaccine-preventable childhood infections like measles given the high birth rate in the camps and evidence that

209

measles transmission continues to linger. Estimates of the basic reproductive number and size of the next outbreak

210

from this analysis reinforce the public health importance of maintaining the high vaccination coverage rates that are

211

known to be necessary for preventing outbreaks of highly-transmissible infections such as measles.
