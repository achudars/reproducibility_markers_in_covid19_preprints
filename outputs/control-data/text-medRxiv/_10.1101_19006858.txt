ABSTRACT

27

Introduction

28

Hospital wastewater is a potential major source of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study

29

uses metagenomics to ask how abundances of AMR genes in hospital wastewater are related

30

to clinical activity.

31

Methods

32

Sewage was collected over a 24-hour period from multiple wastewater collection points

33

representing different specialties within a tertiary hospital site and simultaneously from

34

community sewage works. High throughput shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina

35

HiSeq4000. AMR gene abundances were correlated to hospital antimicrobial usage (AMU),

36

data on clinical activity and resistance prevalence in clinical isolates.

37

Findings

38

Microbiota and AMR gene composition varied between each collection point and overall AMR

39

gene abundance was higher in hospital wastewater than in community influent. The

40

composition of AMR genes correlated with microbiota composition (Procrustes analysis,

41

p=0.002). Increased antimicrobial consumption at a class level was associated with higher

42

AMR gene abundance within that class in wastewater (incidence rate ratio 2.80, C.I. 1.2-6.5,

43

p=0.016). Prolonged average patient length of stay was associated with higher total AMR gene

44

abundance in wastewater (incidence rate ratio 2.05, C.I. 1.39-3.01, p=0.0003). AMR gene

45

abundance at a class level within hospital wastewater did not reflect resistance patterns in the

46

181 clinical isolates grown from hospital inpatients over the time of wastewater sampling.

47

Conclusions

48

Hospital antimicrobial consumption and patient length of stay are important drivers of AMR

49

gene outflow into the environment. Using metagenomics to identify the full range of AMR

INTRODUCTION

54

In response to the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis, a challenge for the research and

55

medical communities is understanding the flow of AMR between different environmental

56

niches1 and deciding where to focus surveillance and interventions to inform effective policies

57

and action2. There is an increasing interest in the contribution of hospital wastewater to AMR

58

in the environment. Sewage treatment does not completely eradicate AMR genes and thus

59

AMR genes can enter the food chain through water and the use of sewage sludge in

60

agriculture3,4.

61

community sewage as a surveillance tool to monitor the global epidemiology of AMR has

62

recently been explored5.

63

Hospitals are epidemiologically important nodal points for concentrated antimicrobial

64

consumption and are sources of resistant pathogens6. Secondary care surveillance, guided by

65

national and international policies7,8, is based on passive reporting of phenotypic laboratory

66

results for specific pathogens or from screening samples on specific high risk patients9,10. These

67

methods will not represent the full impact of antimicrobial use and inpatient activity on AMR

68

carriage within a hospital, and thus risk of transmission, or capture all pertinent antimicrobial

69

resistance genes (AMR genes). As hospital wastewater contains inpatient bodily waste we

70

hypothesised that it could be used as a representation of inpatient community carriage of AMR

71

and as such may be a useful surveillance tool.

72

Many previous studies have identified key pathogens and resistant genes in hospital

73

wastewater11–16 and some attempts have been made to correlate resistance of specific organisms

74

in hospital clinical isolates with resistance in hospital wastewater with conflicting results17–19.

75

There is currently a knowledge gap on how resistance in hospital wastewater quantitatively

76

reflects clinical activity within hospitals. By applying the technique of metagenomics5 to obtain

As a complex matrix representing human bodily waste the potential of

77

a universal view of AMR gene composition in hospital wastewater in this study we were able

78

to interrogate this relationship in a multi-departmental study.

79
80

METHODS

81

Sewage collection and antibiotic residue analysis

82

Sampling was performed in June 2017 on eight wastewater collection points (CP), representing

83

different clinical departments, identified to capture the effluent from the majority of the

84

Western General Hospital, Edinburgh (Supplementary Figure 1). Using composite sampling

85

machines, 100 mL of wastewater was sampled every 15 minutes over a 24-hour period thus

86

aiming to collect a representative sample of the hospital inpatient population. Simultaneously,

87

a 24-hour time proportional sample was collected at the inflow site to Seafield community

88

sewage works, which serves a population equivalent of 760,000 from Edinburgh and the

89

Lothians. Samples were transported from the site on dry ice and stored at -80oC. Antibiotic

90

residue analysis was performed on 1L of composite hospital wastewaters and 1L of domestic

91

sewage using LC-MS/MS as previously described5,20.

92

DNA extraction and analysis

93

DNA was extracted from sewage using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool mini kit with an optimized

94

protocol as previously described21 and sequenced on the HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina) using

95

2x 150bp paired-end sequencing. Paired reads were then assigned using Kraken222 and a

96

database of known vector sequences, UniVec_Core (downloaded 9th April 2019). Taxonomic

97

assignments were summarized at the genus level using kraken-biom23. One sample, CP2, was

98

heavily contaminated and removed from further analysis. Using the ResFinder database within

99

the MGMapper web tool, functional metagenomic antibiotic resistance determinants were

100

identified24.

101

Data collection

102

Data was collected on clinical isolates from the week surrounding the hospital wastewater

103

sampling to represent pathogens in hospital inpatients. All types of clinical isolate were

104

included but duplicate samples from the same patient within a 48-hour period were omitted

105

from the final analysis. Antimicrobial usage was collated in the form of weekly pharmacy

106

issues to each ward over the 3 months prior to sampling and presented as defined daily dose

107

per 100 occupied bed days (DDD/100OBDs). Pharmacy issues for prescriptions for outpatient

108

use and for theatres were excluded.

109

Data analysis

110

All statistical analysis and plots were produced using R version 3.6.025.

111

Using the output from Kraken and Resfinder the relative abundance of AMR genes and

112

bacterial genera were calculated as FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million

113

mapped bacterial reads) to account for both sample-wise sequencing depth differences and

114

size-dependent probability of observing a reference26. Relative abundances and dissimilarity

115

matrices of bacterial genera and AMR genes were determined and the top 50 AMR genes were

116

visualised using a heatmap with gene-wise and collection point dendograms as previously

117

described5. Procrustes anaylsis was used to test the association between the resistome and

118

bacteriome dissimilarities.

119

Correlation between inpatient activity and AMR gene abundance

120

The source of variance in the abundance of AMR genes between the collection points was

121

investigated using a multilevel Poisson model with the dependent variable as counts of AMR

122

gene reads at each collection point aggregated at the class level, offset by the log of the average

123

gene-length per antibiotic class multiplied by the total bacterial reads per collection point.

124

Random effects of collection point, antimicrobial class and observation were included in the

125

model, the latter to model the over dispersion inherent to count data27.

126

Each of the potential fixed effects were evaluated for correlation. If two variables were highly

127

correlated (>0.7) only one variable was chosen (based on lowest Akaike information criterion,

128

AIC). Using AMU in DDD per 100 OBD at the collection point level we accounted for co- and

129

cross-resistance by fitting both a measure of direct selection for resistance (effect of usage of

130

one antimicrobial class on AMR genes that confer resistance to that antimicrobial class) and

131

indirect selection (effect of total AMU on AMR gene abundance).

132

To assess the relationship between AMR in clinical isolates and AMR gene abundance in

133

hospital wastewater a binomial generalised linear mixed effects model was used including the

134

same three random effects with an addition of a random effect of species to control for inter-

135

species heterogeneity. Isolate type was included in the model as urinary/faecal or non-urinary

136

due to the different dynamics of inpatient bodily waste being represented in the wastewater

137

system. A similar model was additionally used to evaluate the relationship between AMR in

138

clinical isolates and AMU of the inpatient community.

139

Ethics

140

This study was conducted following approval from NHS Lothian Research and Development

141

committee under the sponsorship of University of Edinburgh. There was no direct patient

142

contact and therefore the study did not require ethical board approval.

143
144

RESULTS

145

The hospital departments served by the wastewater collection points differed by pattern of

146

antimicrobial use (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2) and resistance in the 181 clinical isolates

147

identified in the week surrounding wastewater sampling (Supplementary Figure 3).

148

Metagenomics of wastewater

149

An average read pair count of 38.5 million (range 35.8-39.2 million) was obtained with an

150

average of 76% (range 67-81%) of reads allocated to bacteria from the seven hospital

151

wastewater samples and one community sewage sample (sequencing reads can be found

152

under Bioproject accession number PRJEB34410). An average of 0.08% of reads mapped to

153

AMR genes in the seven hospital wastewater samples versus 0.03% from Seafield

154

community sewage works (Supplementary Table 1).

155
156

One thousand and forty-seven unique bacterial genera were detected across all samples (range

157

705-965 genera per sample, Supplementary Table 2). The top nineteen genera accounted for

158

>60% of bacterial abundance in all samples (Figure 1, panel D). The most predominant genera

159

were Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, mainly environmental species such as Pseudomonas

160

fluorsecens, Acinetobacter johnsonii, likely representing bacteria from biofilms within the

161

hospital pipes. When compared with the Seafield community sewage sample, there was a

162

difference in diversity with a higher predominance of gut associated bacteria including

163

Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Escherichia in the hospital samples.

164

(Figure 1, Panel B & D).

165

AMR gene abundance and composition varied across different hospital collection points and

166

Seafield (Figures 1 panel A & C, Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 4 & 6). Apart from the

167

wastewater collected at CP4 which houses patients directly admitted from the community,

168

AMR gene abundance from hospital effluent was higher than AMR gene abundance in Seafield

169

community sewage works (Figure 2, Supplementary Fig 4). AMR gene composition was

170

strongly correlated with bacterial genus level composition (Procrustes, p=0.002)

171

(Supplementary Figure 5).

172

Over 60% of the resistome of hospital wastewater and community sewage samples is composed

173

of the 15 most abundant genes (Supplementary Figure 6), mainly belonging to the

174

aminoglycoside and macrolide antimicrobial classes (Figure 1, panel C). In total, we detected

175

168 different resistance genes belonging to ten different antimicrobial classes (Supplementary

176

Table 3). The genes detected included key AMR genes of interest to infection control including

177

blaOXA, blaIMP and genes of the VanA cassette.

178

Inpatient activity and AMR gene abundance

179

With increasing usage of an antimicrobial class there was a significant increase in the

180

abundance of AMR genes belonging to that class (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.80, C.I. 1.2-6.5,

181

p=0.016, Figure 3). No relationship between total AMU per collection point and total AMR

182

gene abundance was identified implying that cross- resistance is not extensively contributing

183

to AMR gene abundance. The abundance of AMR genes increased with increasing patient

184

length of stay (IRR 2.05, C.I. 1.39-3.01, p=0.0003, Figure 3). This result is not because of

185

increasing AMU with increasing LOS as these two variables are not correlated at collection

186

point level but instead likely reflects transmission amongst hospital inpatients. A minor but

187

significant interaction was identified between length of stay and DDDs per 100 OBDs which

188

implies that following a certain degree of antimicrobial exposure and hospital exposure through

189

length of stay there is no longer a cumulative effect on AMR gene abundance. The effect of

190

patient age was not significant.

191
192

Stratifying for species heterogeneity, AMR gene abundance at a class level within hospital

193

wastewater did not reflect resistance patterns in the clinical isolates from hospital inpatients

194

around the time of wastewater sampling (Supplementary Table 4). There was no difference

195

between the relationship of the directly excreted urinary and faecal isolates with AMR gene

196

abundance and other isolate types e.g. skin which would only reach the wastewater system

197

indirectly via run off from showers. At an antimicrobial class level the resistance observed in

198

clinical isolates did not reflect the antimicrobial usage of that class in the preceding 3 months.

200

Analysis of antibiotic residues in hospital effluent and community influent reflected the high

201

AMU within the hospital with an average 12-fold increased concentration in hospital effluent

202

(ranging between 4 and 13 µL-1) for the five classes measured (Supplementary Figure 7). Our

203

residue data only represents the residue levels from the whole hospital and not individual

204

collection points and thus cannot be specifically correlated with AMR gene abundance.

205
206

DISCUSSION

207

This study identified that hospital AMU and patient length of stay impacts AMR gene

208

abundances in hospital effluent and has implications upstream for infection control in the

209

hospital and downstream for AMR in the environment. Overall, the distribution of bacterial

210

genera and AMR genes in our hospital wastewater samples and domestic sewage sample is

211

similar to previous described sewage composition in European regions5,28.

212

There are different plausible explanations for the positive relationship between AMU and AMR

213

gene abundance. These include inpatient faecal and urinary carriage of AMR genes both from

214

direct antimicrobial exposure and from transmission between patients. However, exposure of

215

environmental bacteria in the hospital waste pipes, which may reside in biofilms for months,

216

to high levels of unmetabolised excreted antimicrobials from patients is also likely to play a

217

significant role29. Indeed, our data shows that the hospital antimicrobial residues are within

218

the minimum selection concentration range for some pathogen antimicrobial combinations e.g.

219

Escherichia coli and ciprofloxacin resistance30. A relationship has been previously observed at

220

a country level both between both AMU and antimicrobial residue levels and AMU and AMR

221

gene abundance in sewage5.

222

The implications of the relationship between AMU and AMR gene abundance in wastewater

223

can be illustrated by the strong correlation between abundance of carbapenem resistance genes

224

and carbapenem consumption (R2=0.87). Where a particular ward or department consumes

10

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19006858; this version posted September 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

225

high levels of carbapenem then this work demonstrates that there could be high levels of

226

undetected faecal or urinary carriage of carbapenem resistance genes which could warrant more

227

stringent isolation of these patients, in fitting with concerns about “unsampled transmission

228

chains” in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae31. Alternatively, or in addition to, if the

229

70% renal excretion of unchanged meropenem is selecting out resistant organisms in the pipes

230

for release into the environment then procedures for the bodily waste of patients on meropenem

231

may need to be reconsidered.

232

The positive effect of increasing length of stay on AMR gene abundance is in keeping with

233

prolonged duration of inpatient stay being a risk factor for carriage and infection with resistant

234

microorganisms32–34. That length of stay remains as a signal even despite controlling for

235

antimicrobial consumption supports the theory of transmission of antimicrobial resistant

236

organisms amongst patients and their local environment during their inpatient stay. This has

237

further implications for hospital infection control management of long stay patients as they

238

may be more likely to harbour key AMR genes32,35 and be a source for transmission.

239

As the majority of AMR genes are carried by non-pathogenic commensal bacteria36 the

240

advantage of using metagenomics is that we are able to capture AMR genes carried by the wide

241

variety of bacterial genera identified. Although shotgun sequencing cannot identify which

242

bacteria are carrying which AMR genes our results indicate that the AMR genes present are

243

highly correlated with the bacteria identified at that collection point (Supplementary Fig 7).

244

This can explain why levels of AMR genes for aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and macrolides

245

may be higher than expected in relation to phenotypic resistance in clinical isolates; the

246

composition of bacterial genera selected out may have intrinsic or high levels of resistance to

247

these antimicrobial classes. The potential for transfer of AMR genes within the sewage network

248

onto human pathogens has been demonstrated indicating the importance of obtaining a

249

universal view of AMR genes16.

250

No quantitative relationship was observed between clinical isolates stratified by organism and

251

isolate type and AMR gene abundance in hospital wastewater. There are multiple possible

252

explanations for this. The clinical isolates grown were only 7% of all microbiological samples

253

taken and only represent a selected group of hospital patients whereas the hospital wastewater

254

represents the carriage of the whole inpatient population. Faecal or urinary resistance carriage

255

is often present on non-pathogenic organisms and does not always progress to clinical disease

256

represented by clinical isolate growth. In addition, other biological niches of human resistance

257

carriage that will not well be represented in our hospital wastewater samples. The lack of

258

relationship could also be due to the inherent issues of correlating phenotypic resistance and

259

genotypic resistance and the loss of resolution in allocating resistances into antimicrobial

260

classes rather than individual drugs. In addition, it may be because different relationships exist

261

at an organism and AMR gene level in sewage which are lost in trying to compare the two

262

microbial communities. A recent study using EARS-net clinical isolate data and urban sewage

263

samples found correlations in only a small proportion of pathogen-antimicrobial relationships

264

studied37. Due to conflicting relationships in the literature11,12,14,37, further detailed work on

265

specific organisms, isolate types and resistance in sewage is required to interrogate these

266

relationships further.

267

No relationship was identified between AMU in the previous 3 months and resistance in

268

clinical isolates stratified by species and isolate type. This can also be explained by many of

269

the reasons discussed above. Previous literature examining this has only found a relationship

270

between specific organisms and antibiotics over a much longer time period38,39.

271

There was a higher abundance of AMR genes in the hospital wastewater samples when

272

compared to Seafield community sewage works. This is likely due to dilution, a general loss

273

of AMR-gene carrying human commensal bacteria in the environment of sewerage system40

274

and exposure to lower levels of antibiotic residues. When comparing sewage influent in paired

275

communities with and without a hospital Buelow et al concluded that there was minimal effect

276

of a hospital on community influent28. However, in other work, hospital wastewater impacted

277

resistome composition at an individual gene level41. It is worth noting that the AMR gene

278

abundance in our urban sewage influent (Seafield community sewage works), which receives

279

the hospital wastewater from our studied hospital and another large tertiary hospital, is higher

280

than the hospital wastewater collected in CP4, the admissions unit which is our closest

281

representation of community AMR carriage. Concern has been raised relating to the impact of

282

hospital wastewater on urban influent and effluent and specific water treatments for hospital

283

wastewater have been called for. This work highlights the concept that physicians should

284

consider, where possible, prescribing of environmentally degradable antimicrobials e.g. beta-

285

lactams over those antimicrobials which have persistent residues which are mobile between

286

environmental niches e.g. tetracycline to minimise the impact of antimicrobials on the

287

environmental resistome42. The ultimate effect of environmental AMR genes on human health

288

is an ongoing important research question29.

289

One of the strengths of this study is the use of metagenomics to quantify resistance genes to a

290

wide range of antibiotics. This technique would also allow for retrospective investigation if

291

new resistance genes emerge. However, when, as in this analysis, antibiotics and AMR genes

292

are grouped together at a class level detail can be lost and there are incidences when looking

293

for specific pathogens and resistance genes is warranted. The use of 24-hour composite

294

samplers is a strong technique to give a representative sample of the hospital but it must be

295

considered that hospital staff, outpatients and visitors will have also contributed to the effluent.

296

In addition, a proportion of patients will have moved around the hospital during the period

297

studied. Although this study is limited to one hospital site at one time point the variation in

298

antimicrobial use and inpatient characteristics in each department has allowed us to treat them

as discrete treatment centres and draw conclusions about factors affecting AMR gene

300

abundance.

301

There is little doubt that hospital resistant pathogens can be abundant in wastewater

302

systems15,16,18. The results from this study imply that the place for measuring AMR genes using

303

this novel tool of using metagenomics to analyse hospital wastewater is not to comment on

304

resistance in clinical isolates within the hospital. Rather its utility could fall on representing

305

carriage of AMR in hospital inpatients and hospital pipes and identification of emerging key

306

AMR genes in relation to changing patterns of transmission, infection control policies and

307

antimicrobial usage. Further work evaluating using spot samples and optimal collection points

308

of hospital wastewater would be required.

309

In conclusion, we show in a multi-departmental study that AMR gene abundance in hospital

310

wastewater is influences by hospital AMU and length of inpatient stay. Our study further

311

emphasises the AMR gene transmission risks of exposure to high antimicrobial consuming and

312

high resistance carriage environments. Hospital wastewater is an important source of AMR

313

into the environment and should be considered in environmental policy to reduce the flow of

314

AMR between different environmental reservoirs.
