ABSTRACT

Background: Recent studies demonstrated that Aquamin®, a calcium-, magnesium-, and
multiple trace element-rich natural product, improves barrier structure and function in colonoids
obtained from tissue of healthy subjects. The goal of the present study was to determine if the
colonic barrier could be improved in tissue from subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC).
Methods: Colonoid cultures were established with tissue from 9 individuals with UC. The
colonoids were then incubated for a 2-week period under control conditions (i.e., in culture
medium with a final calcium concentration of 0.25 mM) or in the same medium supplemented
with Aquamin® to provide 1.5 – 4.5 mM calcium. Effects on differentiation and barrier protein
expression were determined using several approaches: phase-contrast & scanning electron
microscopy, quantitative histology & immunohistology, mass spectrometry-based proteome
assessment and transmission electron microscopy.
Results: Aquamin®-treated colonoids demonstrated a modest up-regulation of tight junctional
proteins but stronger induction of adherens junction proteins and desmosomal proteins.
Increased desmosomes were seen at the ultrastructural level. Proteomic analysis also
demonstrated increased expression of basement membrane proteins and hemidesmosomal
components. Proteins expressed at the apical surface (mucins and trefoils) were also increased
as were several additional proteins with anti-microbial activity or that modulate inflammation.
Conclusion: A majority of individuals including patients with UC do not reach the recommended
daily intake for calcium and other minerals. The findings presented here suggest that adequate
mineral intake might improve the colonic barrier.

INTRODUCTION

An intact colonic barrier is necessary for gastrointestinal health (1). Colonic barrier dysfunction
is a consistent feature of inflammatory bowel disease, seen in both Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis (UC) (2-5). Barrier dysfunction is also seen in irritable bowel syndrome (6,7)
and celiac disease (7), as well as in conjunction with acute bacterial infection of the
gastrointestinal tract (8). While barrier dysfunction can result from toxic insults or from
inflammatory attack on the epithelial cells lining the colon, it is now becoming recognized that
pre-existing weaknesses in the gastrointestinal barrier may predispose the tissue to
inflammation and injury.

Environmental factors, especially diet, have a significant impact on colonic barrier health. A
high-fat diet has been shown to increase intestinal permeability (8) as has hyperglycemia (9).
Most studies have focused on tight junctional complexes as the primary regulator of
permeability, and high-fat or high-sugar intake has been shown to affect these structures (8,9).
Our own work has demonstrated the importance of calcium as a regulator of the colonic barrier.
In a recent study (10) we showed that increasing the extracellular calcium concentration from a
basal level of 0.25 mM to as high as 3.0 mM in human colon organoid (colonoid) culture had a
modest effect on expression of tight junction proteins, but dramatically up-regulated
desmosomal proteins (desmoglein-2, desmocollin-2, and desmoplakin). This was accompanied
by an actual increase in desmosomes seen at the ultrastructural level. A substantial increase in
multiple basement membrane components including laminin α, β and γ chains as well as
nidogen and perlecan (basement membrane heparin sulfate proteoglycan) was also observed in
calcium-treated colonoids.

As part of our investigation, we carried out assays to assess the effects of calciumsupplementation on trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and colonoid cohesion (11).
Consistent with tight junctional protein expression under control conditions, TEER values were
high to begin with. In spite of the high background, electrical resistance still increased in
response to calcium-supplementation. Colonoid cohesion, consistent with the dramatic
increase in desmosomes and basement membrane proteins in response to intervention, was
low in basal medium but increased substantially in treated colonoids. Of interest, while calcium
provided as a single agent was effective, a calcium- and magnesium-rich multi-mineral natural
product (Aquamin®) was more effective than calcium alone.

These findings indicate that colonoid culture technology can provide a useful tool for elucidating
factors that affect barrier structure and function in the colon. The present study extends this
work. Here we describe results with colonoid cultures established with tissue from UC patients.
The UC-derived colonoids were maintained under control conditions (0.25 mM calcium) or
treated with Aquamin® - the same multi-mineral natural used in our previous studies - at
amounts bringing the final calcium level to 1.5 - 4.5 mM. Effects on components of the barrier
were determined using several approaches.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Aquamin®. Aquamin® is a multi-mineral natural product obtained from the mineralized remains of
red marine algae of the Lithothamnion family. Aquamin®-Soluble, the form used here, has been
used in our previous colonoid studies (10-12). It consists of calcium (approximately 12% by
weight), a calcium to magnesium ratio of 12:1 and detectable levels of 72 other trace minerals –
essentially all of the minerals accumulated in the algae fronds from seawater. During growth, the
mineralized fronds break off from the viable algae and fall to the ocean floor from where they are
harvested. After harvest, the fronds are processed to remove organic material, leaving only the
mineral remains. Aquamin® is sold as a food supplement (GRAS 00028) and is used in various
products for human consumption in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America [Marigot Ltd, Cork,
IR]. A single batch of Aquamin® was used in the present study. Mineral analysis of this batch was
provided by an independent laboratory (Advanced Laboratories; Salt Lake City, Utah) using
Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Mineral composition is provided in
Supplement Table 1.

Establishment of colonoid cultures from UC biopsies. De-identified colonic tissue (2.5-mm
biopsies) was obtained from the sigmoid colon of eleven subjects during colonoscopy. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review board (IRBMED) at the University of Michigan
and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to endoscopy.

Colonoid cultures were established as described in our recent reports with tissue from healthy
subjects (10-13). Briefly, biopsies were finely minced on ice using a #21 scalpel and seeded
into matrigel (Corning), prepared at 8 mg/mL. A size of 40 µm (diameter) was considered ideal
for tissue fragment size. During the expansion phase (between two and five weeks), colonoids
were incubated in L-WRN medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and providing a source

of Wnt3a, R-spondin-3 and Noggin. The medium was supplemented with small molecule
inhibitors: 500 nM A 83-01 (Tocris), a TGF-β inhibitor, 10 µM SB 202190 (Sigma), a p38
inhibitor and 10 µM Y27632 (Tocris) as a ROCK inhibitor. For the first 10 days of culture, the
medium was also supplemented with 2.5 µM CHIR9902 (Tocris) to enhance Wnt signaling.

After establishment, experiments were carried out in a mixture of L-WRN culture medium diluted
1:4 with KGM Gold, a serum-free, calcium-free culture medium (Lonza) designed for epithelial
cell proliferation. The final serum concentration in the media was 2.5% and final calcium
concentration was 0.25 mM. This “control treatment medium” was compared to the same
medium supplemented with Aquamin® to provide a final calcium concentration of 1.5, 2.1, 3.0 or
4.5 mM. Fresh medium and treatments were provided at 2-day intervals. The last 2-day
medium collected before harvest at day-14 were saved for cytokine assessment. At the end of
the in-life phase, colonoid samples were evaluated for gross appearance using both phasecontrast microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Other samples were prepared
for histology and examined at the light-microscopic level after staining with hematoxylin and
eosin. The same preparation was used for immunohistology. Additional samples were fixed in
glutaraldehyde and used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, samples were
frozen in liquid nitrogen and allocated to proteomic analysis.
Phase-contrast microscopy. Phase-contrast microscopy (Hoffman Modulation Contrast - Olympus
IX70 with a DP71 digital camera) was used to assess colonoids in whole-mount for change in size
and shape.
Histology, immunohistology and Morphometric analysis. At the end of the in-culture phase,
colonoids were isolated from Matrigel using 2mM EDTA and fixed in 10% formalin for 1 hour.
Fixed colonoids were suspended in HistoGel (Thermo Scientific) and then processed for

histology (i.e., hematoxylin and eosin staining) or for immunohistology. For immunostaining,
freshly-cut sections (5-6 microns) were rehydrated and subjected to heat-induced epitope
retrieval with high pH or low pH FLEX TRS Retrieval buffer (Agilent Technologies, 154 #K8004;
Santa Clara, CA) for 20 minutes. After peroxidase blocking, antibodies were applied at
appropriate dilutions at room temperature for 30 or 60 minutes depending on the manufacturer’s
recommendation. The FLEX HRP EnVision System (Agilent Technologies) was used for
detection with a 10-minute DAB chromagen application. Supplement Table 2 provides a list of
antibodies used, their source and additional experimental details.
The sections of immunostained colonoid tissue on glass slides were digitized using the Aperio
AT2 whole slide scanner (Leica Biosystems) at a resolution of 0.5µm per pixel with 20X
objective. These scanned images were housed on a server and accessed using Leica Aperio
eSlide Manager (Version 12.3.2.5030), a digital pathology management software. The digitized
histological sections were viewed and analyzed using Aperio ImageScope (Version 12.4.0.5043
by Leica Biosystems), a slide viewing software. Brightfield Immunohistochemistry Image
Analysis tools (Leica) were used to quantify immunostains used in this study. Aperio Nuclear
Algorithm (v9) was used for proliferation marker (Ki67) quantification. This algorithm measures
intensity of nuclear staining and separates those into very intense to no nuclear staining (3+, 2+,
1+ and 0 respectively). Nuclei with higher intensity (3+ and 2+) were used here for comparison.
The Aperio Positive Pixel Count Algorithm (v9) was used to quantify expression of the other
markers. It quantifies number and the intensity of pixels of a specific color in a digitized image.
Positivity was calculated with respective numbers of strong positive and positive pixels against
total pixels.
SEM and TEM. Colonoid specimens were fixed in situ in 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
Sorensen’s buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 4oC. After subsequent processing for SEM or TEM as
described previously (14), samples for SEM were then mounted on stubs, allowed to off-gas in a

vacuum desiccator for at least two hours and sputter coated with gold. Samples were examined
with an Amray 1910 FE Scanning Electron Microscope and digitally imaged using Semicaps
2000 software. For TEM, ultra-thin sections were examined using a Philips CM100 electron
microscope at 60 kV. Images were recorded digitally using a Hamamatsu ORCA-HR digital
camera system operated with AMT software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp.,
Danvers, MA).
Differential proteomic analysis. Colonoids were isolated from Matrigel using 2mM EDTA for 15
minutes and then exposed to Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) - lysis and extraction
buffer (Pierce, # 89901; ThermoFisher Scientific) for protein isolation, as described in our
previous reports (10,12). Proteomic experiments were carried out in the Proteomics Resource
Facility (PRF) in the Department of Pathology at the University of Michigan, employing mass
spectrometry-based Tandem Mass Tag (TMT, ThermoFisher Scientific). Fifty micrograms of
colonoid protein from each condition (three subjects assessed separately) was digested
separately with trypsin and individual samples labeled with one of 6 isobaric mass tags following
the manufacturer’s protocol. After labeling, equal amounts of peptide from each condition were
mixed together. In order to achieve in-depth characterization of the proteome, the labeled
peptides were fractionated using 2D-LC (basic pH reverse-phase separation followed by acidic
pH reverse phase) and analyzed on a high-resolution, tribrid mass spectrometer (Orbitrap
Fusion Tribrid, ThermoFisher Scientific) using conditions optimized at the PRF. MultiNotch MS3
analysis (15) was employed to obtain accurate quantitation of the identified
proteins/peptides. Data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer (v 2.3,
ThermoFisher Scientific). MS2 spectra were searched against UniProt human protein database
(20353 sequences; downloaded on 06/20/2019) using the following search parameters: MS1
and MS2 tolerance were set to 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively; carbamidomethylation of
cysteines (57.02146 Da) and TMT labeling of lysine and N-termini of peptides (229.16293 Da)

were considered static modifications; oxidation of methionine (15.9949 Da) and deamidation of
asparagine and glutamine (0.98401 Da) were considered variable. Identified proteins and
peptides were filtered to retain only those that passed ≤2% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold
of detection. Quantitation was performed using high-quality MS3 spectra (Average signal-tonoise ratio of 9 and <40% isolation interference). Differential protein expression between
conditions, normalizing to control (0.25mM calcium) for each subject’s specimens separately
was established using edgeR (16). Then, resulting data from the three data sets were
combined. Proteins names were retrieved using Uniprot.org, and reactome V70 (reactome.org)
was used for pathway enrichment analyses (17). Only Proteins with a ≤2% FDR confidence of
detection were included in the analyses. The initial analysis was targeted towards differentiation,
barrier-related, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion proteins. Follow-up analysis involved an
unbiased proteome-wide screen of all proteins modified by intervention in relation to control.
Cytokine assay. Approximately 400 µL of culture medium was collected at the time of harvest.
A panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β
(IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8 and macrophage chemotactic peptide-1 (MCP-1) was assessed. Levels of
each were determined using the Bio-Plex bead-based cytokine assay from Bio-Rad
Laboratories (Hercules, CA).
Statistical analysis. Group means and standard deviations were obtained for discrete
morphological and immunohistochemical features as well as for individual protein values
(proteomic analysis) and cytokine values. Data generated in this way were analyzed by
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by unpaired t-test (two-tailed) for comparison using
GraphPad Prism version 8. Proteome Discoverer (v 2.3) also computed an abundance ratio p
value based on a nested design of biological replicates. It presents the p value of the sample
group calculated by running the Tukey HSD test (post hoc) after an ANOVA test. Pathways

RESULTS

Establishment of colonoid cultures from UC biopsies. Colonic tissue (duplicate 2-mm biopsies)
was obtained by endoscopy from the sigmoid colon of 11 subjects with a diagnosis of UC. Five
of the subjects had active disease at time of biopsy. The other six participants were considered
to be in remission; though all had disease-related symptoms (or active flare) within the past four
years of tissue collection. Relevant demographic and clinical information is presented in Table
1. Tissue was established in colonoid culture as described in the Materials and Methods
Section. Two of the active-lesion samples failed to grow and were eventually discarded.
Successful cultures were established from the remaining nine tissue samples. The “inremission” colonic tissue samples were satisfactorily-expanded and were ready for
experimentation after two to three weeks – similar to tissue from healthy individuals (10).
Tissue from “active lesion” samples required 3-5 weeks to reach this stage.

Effects of mineral intervention on gross and microscopic features. Once established, colonoids
were incubated for a two-week period (with subculture at the end of week-one) under control
conditions (0.25 mM calcium) or in the presence of the multi-mineral intervention formulated to
provide 1.5 – 4.5 mM calcium. Phase-contrast images and SEM images taken at harvest
(Figure 1a-h) identified no gross morphological changes attributable to the intervention. In both
control and treated cultures, individual colonoids appeared as round or egg-shaped structures.
Most colonoids consisted of a single structure but some were multi-lobed. In most places, the
colonoids still had a layer of the Matrigel substrate attached, but in other places, the substrate
was gone and individual colonoid cells could be seen. At the beginning of the treatment phase,
and immediately after the first subculture, colonoid structures were approximately 40 µm in size
(on average). Over the culture period, they increased to approximately 400 µm in diameter.

Overall, UC-derived colonoid appearance and growth characteristics were similar to what has
been reported previously with colonoids established from tissue of healthy individuals (10).

Although there were no apparent differences in gross morphology, differences in differentiation
features were revealed by quantitative histology and immunohistology. As seen in hematoxylin
and eosin-stained tissue sections (Figure 1i-m), colonoids maintained for two weeks in the
presence of the multi-mineral intervention had a larger lumen diameter and greater wall
thickness than control. This was confirmed morphometrically (Figure 1s). Expression of the
differentiation marker, CK20 (Figure 1n-r), was substantial under control conditions, but still
increased (albeit, modestly) in response to treatment (Figure 1t). These findings from the gross
and microscopic analyses allow us to conclude that colonoids established from UC tissue reveal
a high degree of differentiation in the control medium. Even with the high background, exposure
to the combination of minerals in Aquamin® “pushes” differentiation further, which is evident by
the change in morphology and increase in the expression of CK20.

Epithelial differentiation is linked with growth reduction (18). As part of our evaluation, we
assessed Ki67 expression in control and treated colonoids. A decrease in Ki67 expression was
seen with treatment (Supplement Figure 1a-e, k). Levels under both control and treated
conditions were comparable to what was seen previously in colonoids from healthy subjects
(10), but lower than what we observed with colon adenomas in culture (12).

Effects of Aquamin® on proteins involved in differentiation, cell-cell / cell-matrix adhesion and
barrier formation. A Tandem Mass Tag mass spectrometry-based approach was used to
assess the effects of Aquamin® on proteins involved in differentiation and barrier formation.
Table 2 provides a list of proteins that are part of the differentiation process and / or contribute
to the barrier. There are several things to note. First, CK20 up-regulation was seen with

Aquamin®-treatment; this is consistent with the immunohistochemical expression data shown as
part of Figure 1. A number of other differentiation-related proteins were also up-regulated in
Aquamin®-treated colonoids (Table 2), but only with CK80 was the level of up-regulation
comparable to that of CK20. Several additional keratins to those shown in Table 2 were also
detected but did not change significantly with treatment or actually decreased with intervention.

Second, several proteins that make up tight junctions were detected but overall showed little
change in response to mineral-intervention. Claudin-4 was the most responsive tight junction
protein but was only increased by 1.4-fold at maximum. In contrast, desmosomal proteins were
strongly up-regulated with increasing concentrations of the multi-mineral product. Several
cadherin family members (adherens junction proteins) were also up-regulated. The major
exception was cadherin-1 (E-cadherin), a protein closely associated with tight junction
organization and that is known to have low sensitivity to changes in calcium concentration (19).

Immunohistology was used to confirm desmoglein-2 expression and change with intervention.
As expected based on proteomic analysis, there was little expression under control conditions
but strong up-regulation with intervention (Figure 2a-e, i). Control and Aquamin®-treated
colonoid samples were also evaluated by TEM (Figure 2f-h). Desmosomes were visible under
all conditions, but desmosome numbers increased measurably in treated colonoids as
compared to control (white arrows) (Figure 2f-h, j). Desmosomes from the treated samples also
tended to be wider and more electron-dense. As part of the immunohistological evaluation,
cadherin-17 expression was evaluated as an adherens junction protein. Cadherin-17 was
readily detected under low-calcium conditions in colonoid sections, but even with the high
background, an increase with intervention was seen (Supplement Figure 1f-j, l).

In addition to proteins that constitute the major cell-cell adhesion complexes in the colonic
epithelium, several additional proteins that contribute to cellular adhesive functions and to the
structural barrier were also found to be up-regulated in the mineral-treated colonoids (Table 2).
These include proteins making up the basement membrane (laminin α, β and γ chains, nidogen1 [entactin] and perlecan [basement membrane-specific heparin sulfate proteoglycan]) as well
as a protein that contributes to hemidesmosome formation and basement membrane
attachment (e.g., plectin).

Proteins found at the apical surface – mucins and trefoils – are also shown in Table 2. Certain of
these (e.g., mucin-5B & -13 as well as trefoil-1 & -2) were significantly elevated in response to
treatment. Trefoils are proteins that interact with mucins to stabilize the mucous layer (20,21).
Finally, a number of carcinoembryonic antigen related – cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs)
were strongly up-regulated in response to Aquamin®. This family of proteins demonstrated
more subject-to-subject variability than was seen with most of the other moieties. In addition,
whereas most of the relevant proteins increased with increasing mineral concentration, several
CEACAMs showed a peak response to Aquamin® at a level providing 2.1 or 3.0 mM calcium
and fell off at 4.5 mM.

Effects of Aquamin® on proteins with anti-microbial activity and proteins related to inflammation.
In addition to the structural proteins described above, the proteomic analysis also identified upregulation of several proteins with known anti-microbial properties and modulation of additional

decreased while proteins with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activity were
uniformly increased (Table 2). Among the list of up-regulated proteins were meprin A, a

these proteins are thought to have an anti-inflammatory role in colitis. Finally, the major vitamin
D binding protein was also strongly increased with intervention. Vitamin D signaling is important
to calcium uptake and utilization. Supplement Text File 1 provide a list of citations to justify
inclusion of the anti-microbial and inflammation-modulating proteins in Table 2.

Unbiased assessment of proteins up-regulated or down-regulated with multi-mineral
intervention. The proteins presented in Table 2 were chosen based on a known or suspected
role in differentiation and barrier formation or in consideration of their relevance to the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. In parallel, we conducted an unbiased search of the
data base for all proteins up- or down-regulated by Aquamin® treatment. The list of proteins that
met the criteria of 1.8-fold increase or decrease across the three data sets (i.e., from each
subject) with a < 2% FDR are shown in Tables 3 and 4 along with pathways linked to these
proteins. Twenty-nine proteins were up-regulated in all three specimens (Table 3). Of interest,
the majority of these were proteins involved in differentiation and barrier formation – i.e., the
same proteins presented in Table 2. There were 50 down-regulated proteins that met this
criterion. As can be seen from Table 4, many of these were involved in nucleotide metabolism,
proliferation-related signaling and proliferation. Supplement Figure 2 shows the number of upand down-regulated proteins across the three data sets at each of four levels of Aquamin®. The
Venn plots in the upper panel show overlap at each Aquamin® level separately among three
subjects, and the plot in the lower level merges common proteins at all Aquamin®
concentrations and the three data sets. Supplement Table 3 identifies individual proteins
common at different levels of Aquamin®. Lastly, Supplement Table 4 presents a comprehensive
list of proteins (308 proteins in all and up- or down-regulated) that met the criterion of being
significant with a p value of 0.05 or less across all conditions of Aquamin® as compared to
control (regardless of fold-change).

Cytokine profile in control and mineral-treated colonoids. In a final set of experiments, we
assessed 2-day culture fluids obtained from control and Aquamin®-treated colonoid cultures at
day-14 (immediately prior to harvest) for levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL6,
IL-8 and MCP-1). While levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL6 and MCP-1 were near or below quantifiable
limits, substantial amounts of IL-8 were detected in all culture fluids. The average level of IL-8
in control specimens was 410 + 193 pg/mL (n=7) and this was reduced to 362 + 89 pg/mL and
344 + 213 pg/mL in specimens treated with Aquamin® (providing 1.5 and 2.1 mM calcium,
respectively). For comparison, the level of IL-8 seen in colonoids initiated with tissue from
healthy control subjects (available from our previous study [10]) was 268 + 103 pg/mL (n=3).

DISCUSSION

The colonic barrier is compromised in UC patients (2-5), but whether this is simply the result of
inflammatory injury to the epithelial lining, or whether pre-existing barrier weakness is a
contributor to disease susceptibility has not been fully resolved. Regardless, it seems
reasonable to suggest that strengthening the mucosal barrier could be of value. At the very
least, an intact barrier would limit the permeation of both soluble and particulate proinflammatory moieties from the gut into the interstitium. Improvement in the barrier, especially if
it involved the basement membrane, might also retard passage of inflammatory cells into the
epithelium to, presumably, reduce epithelial cell injury. The potential to improve the colonic
barrier, as much as anything, drives the search for natural products and other adjuvant
therapies for use in individuals with UC in remission. Such therapies are unlikely to replace the
potent anti-inflammatory drugs used in the treatment of acute disease flare-ups. None-the-less,
improvement in barrier function in UC patients who are in remission may be of value to many
individuals in so far as this could help maintain the state of remission and reduce
symptomatology during this period. The findings presented in this manuscript suggest that an
appropriate level of mineral intake may be of value in this regard.

Here we demonstrate that treatment of UC tissue in colonoid culture with Aquamin®, a natural
product consisting of calcium and magnesium along with 72 additional trace elements, upregulates multiple proteins that contribute to the formation of a healthy barrier in the colon.
Among these are proteins that comprise the primary cell-cell adhesion complexes – tight
junctions, adherens junctions and, especially, desmosomes. Also up-regulated are major noncollagenous components of the basement membrane along with hemidesmosomal components.
Factors present on the apical surface (mucins, trefoils and CEACAMS) are also up-regulated.

Which of the multiple changes observed here are most important to improved barrier formation
remains to be determined. While most studies have focused on tight junctions and on
desmosomes (21-24), other cellular and extracellular structures contribute. Of these, the
basement membrane may be the most important (25-28). The basement membrane supports
barrier function in several important ways. The basement membrane inhibits bacterial crossing
from the colonic stream into the interstitium and limits leukocyte trafficking from the circulation
into the colonic epithelium. Additionally, the basement membrane is rich in anionic substances
(heparin sulfate proteoglycans) – providing capacity to trap cationic moieties and regulate their
permeation. Perhaps most importantly, the colonic wall consists of a single layer of epithelial
cells and each cell is attached to the basement membrane. When cells detach from this
substratum, they rapidly undergo apoptosis. With that, all barrier function is compromised. Of
interest in this regard, a loss of laminin in the colonic wall of individuals with UC has been noted
(29,30).

Also of interest, past studies have shown that disruption of the basement membrane

or interference with epithelial cell binding to laminin (the major non-collagenous glycoprotein
component of the basement membrane) results in widespread colitis in mice (31).

Proteins expressed at the apical surface (mucins and trefoils) also have a role to play. Mucins
secreted by goblet cells are carbohydrate-rich molecules (32). Trefoils are a family of proteins
that interact with mucins and help organize the mucins into a viscous mucous network to trap
bacteria and other particulates and to prevent their reaching the cell surface. Disruption of this
network has been linked to inflammatory bowel disease (20,21).

Along with structural components of the barrier, a number of peptides with known anti-microbial
activity were induced in response to the multi-mineral intervention (Table 2). These too could
be considered part of the barrier, as could the bacterial film present on the colonocyte surface
20

and bacteria present in the fecal stream (33). When a healthy microbial community is present, it
limits the overgrowth of potentially harmful microbes. In part, this occurs via the healthy
bacteria simply occupying a niche that could otherwise be colonized by pathogens. At the same
time, the healthy microbial population can contribute to the barrier through elaboration of
beneficial metabolites (e.g., short chain fatty acids [SCFA]) rather than toxic bile acids. While
colonoid culture does not provide a means to assess changes in the gut microbial community,
we are (in parallel with the current study) conducting a 90-day interventional trial with Aquamin®
in healthy human subjects Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02647671). In findings to date, Aquamin®
ingestion altered the colonic microbial profile and, concomitantly, decreased bile acids levels
and increased the level of the major SCFA, acetate, as compared to placebo (or calcium alone)
(34). While the ongoing interventional trial is being conducted with healthy volunteers, a similar
study in patients with UC in remission has just begun (Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT03869905).

Finally, our proteomic screen identified Aquamin®-induced changes in a number of proteins
linked to gut inflammation. Pro-inflammatory elements were uniformly down-regulated while
moieties with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activity were increased. It should
be noted in regard to the inflammation-modulating moieties that these were detected in the
colonic tissue, itself, where cellular injury occurs. Of the secreted moieties related to
inflammation, only IL-8 was detected in large amounts; it was decreased with Aquamin®.

Growth-reduction accompanies differentiation in epithelial cells (18). While our unbiased
proteomic analysis showed that most of the up-regulated proteins were part of the differentiation
process, many of the down-regulated proteins were related to proliferation. Consistent with this,
a reduction in Ki67 expression with intervention was seen by immunostaining. It could be
argued that suppression of epithelial cell proliferation in the context of a colonic ulcer might be
an unwanted consequence of a differentiation-promoting intervention. While this possibility

needs to be acknowledged, it is unlikely that effects on proliferation would counteract the
beneficial activities related to improved barrier formation and reduced inflammation.
Hyperplastic epithelial growth is part of the wound-healing process, including in the colon (35),
but its continued presence is a reflection of chronic wound formation. Thus, differentiationmediated suppression of hyperplastic growth in the epithelium (occurring as a normal
component of the wound-healing process) is, ultimately, necessary. Furthermore, colonic
hyperplasia / dysplasia is prognostically-related to cancer development in UC patients (31,36).
A recent study (36) has demonstrated that the accumulation of a protein referred to as Stathmin
(STMN1) in UC lesions is associated with neoplasia. STMN1 was significantly down-regulated
by Aquamin® (up to 3.5 fold-reduction; Table 4A). Thus, proliferation-regulating effects of
Aquamin® might contribute to reduced cancer development in UC patients. Ultimately, these
complex questions will need to be addressed experimentally, and this is beyond the scope of
the current work.

CONCLUSIONS (and implications). A schematic representation of the colonic mucosa in UCderived colonoid culture is presented in Figure 3. It highlights structural changes in the barrier
occurring in response to the multi-mineral intervention. Based on the results presented here,
we hypothesize greater tissue strength, improved cell-basement membrane interaction and a
thicker mucous layer above the apical surface. These changes along with the increased
elaboration of anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory proteins should, ultimately, be beneficial to
individuals with UC in remission.

A majority of individuals in Western society do not reach the recommended daily intake for
calcium (according to U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2015 – 2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans; available at https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/), and this
deficiency contributes to multiple chronic diseases (37,38). Magnesium-deficiency is also

common (39). While there are no intake recommendations for many of the other potentially
important trace elements in Aquamin®, deficiencies likely exist for those elements that are
nutritionally associated with calcium or magnesium. While roles for calcium and magnesium in
prevention of chronic disease are, at least partially, understood, what role micronutrient
deficiencies – including those involving minerals – play in chronic or long-latency diseases is
only beginning to get attention (39,40). To the extent that multi-mineral deficiencies are
common, the findings presented here allow us to hypothesize that such deficiencies might
contribute to weakening of the colonic barrier in many individuals, including those with UC.
Obtaining the proper intake of minerals, either through a healthful eating pattern or through the
use of an appropriate multi-mineral supplement, should be beneficial.

Whether the multi-mineral product investigated here (Aquamin®) or some other mineral
formulation will, ultimately, provide benefit to individuals with UC and whether the intervention
will prove safe and tolerable needs to be established through precisely controlled clinical
studies. While the necessary studies have not yet been conducted, we have just begun a pilotphase trial (Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT03869905) with UC patients in remission to address safety
and tolerability concerns, and to begin generating efficacy data with Aquamin®.

Figure 1. UC colonoid appearance. Phase-contrast microscopy (a-e): At the end of the
incubation period, intact colonoids were examined by phase-contrast microscopy. Colonoids
were present as thick-walled structures with few surface buds. A wide range of sizes and
shapes were seen under all conditions. Bar=400µm. Scanning electron microscopy (f-h):
Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of smooth surface and few buds in
colonoids maintained under low-calcium conditions (f). Aquamin®-treated colonoids (g,h) were
similar to those maintained in the low-calcium medium. Bar =100 µm. Histological features
(i-m): At the end of the incubation period, colonoids were examined by light microscopy after
staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Under low-calcium conditions (i), the colonoids were found
to be crypts of varying size with a single layer of epithelial cells surrounding a central lumen.
Tiny crypts (with as few as 20 cells in cross section) were seen. In the presence of Aquamin® (jm), larger crypts made up of columnar epithelial cells surrounding a large, often irregularshaped lumen were seen. Goblet cells were apparent. Bar=100µm. CK20 expression (n-r):

Transmission electron microscopy (f-h): At the end of the incubation period, ultra-thin
sections were examined for desmosomes and other cell surface structures. Desmosomes were
present in all conditions (white arrows) but a higher density of desmosomes along the lateral
surface (cellular junctions between two cells) could be seen with intervention. Under all
conditions, tight junctions were evident on the luminal surface (black arrows and insets).

there is little observable difference between the two. Desmosomes (shown along the lateral
surface between cells) are increased in response to treatment. This should support increased
tissue strength. Additional changes resulting from Aquamin® intervention include an increase in
the non-collagenous components of the basement membrane and an increase in
hemidesmosomal proteins. These changes should promote improved cell-matrix adhesion.

provide for improved barrier function and (hopefully) help mitigate colonic inflammation.

SUPPLEMENT FIGURE LEGENDS

Supplement Figure 1. Ki67 and cadherin-17 expression by immunohistology. At the end
of the incubation period, colonoids were examined after immunostaining of histological sections.
Ki67 (a-e); Bar=200µm and Cadherin-17 (f-j); Bar=100µm. Quantitative assessment of Ki67
staining (k) is based on nuclear algorithm (v9) and data represent means and standard
deviations from n=3 subjects and 36-78 individual crypts per condition. Asterisks (*) indicate
statistical significance from control at p<0.05. Cadherin-17 (l) values represent positivity
(measured using Positive Pixel Value v9). Means and standard deviations are based on n=3
subjects and 68-124 individual crypts per condition. Asterisks (*) indicate statistical significance
from control at p<0.05. CDH17: Cadherin-17

Supplement Figure 2. Protein distribution with differing Aquamin® levels across three
subjects. At the end of the incubation period, lysates were prepared for proteomic analysis.
Upper panel: Venn plots (generated by BioVenn, a visualization tool) showing the number of
proteins altered (increased or decreased) by an average of 1.8-fold or greater in each of the
three data sets and the overlap across the three specimens at each concentration of Aquamin®.
Lower panel: Venn plot showing distribution of the common proteins (from the top panels)
altered (increased or decreased) by each concentration of Aquamin® with an average of 1.8-fold
or greater and each individual specimen. These data provide an indication of variability among
individual subjects in their response to each concentration of Aquamin®. DSG2: Desmoglein-2;
CDH17: Cadherin-17; LYPD8: Ly6/PLAUR domain-containing protein 8.

The numerical values represent mean ±SD (fold-change of abundance ratio) as compared to the control, based on UC colonic tissue
(n=3 subjects). Each subject was assessed separately using TMT based differential proteomic expression and the data from the
individual sets averaged together. False Discovery rate (FDR) was <1% except two proteins# with FDR<2%. Values were ordered from
maximum to minimum fold-change based on the maximum response with any of the Aquamin® concentrations. To be included, values
were up-regulated by at least 1.8-fold with at least one concentration of Aquamin® as compared to control and common in all three
subjects. Asterisks indicate statistical significance as compared to control at p<0.05. CEACAM: Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell
adhesion molecule; ENPP3: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 3.

The numerical values represent mean ±SD (fold-change of abundance ratio) as compared to the control, based on UC colonic
tissue (n=3 subjects). Each subject was assessed separately using TMT based differential proteomic expression and the data
from the individual sets averaged together. False Discovery rate (FDR) was <1% except two proteins# with FDR<2%. Values were
ordered from minimum to maximum fold-change based on the minimum response with any of the Aquamin® concentrations. To be
included, values were down-regulated by at least 1.8-fold with at least one concentration of Aquamin® as compared to control and
common in all three subjects. Asterisks indicate statistical significance as compared to control at p<0.05. NOP2: Probable 28S
rRNA (cytosine(4447)-C(5))-methyltransferase; PIN4: Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 4.
