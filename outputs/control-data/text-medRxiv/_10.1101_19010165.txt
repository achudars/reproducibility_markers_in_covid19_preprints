Neural Response by Symptom Dimensions

Abstract
Complex clinical presentations are common in youth seeking mental health
treatment, complicating attempts to identify specific biological underpinnings to guide
precision psychiatry. We defined four classes of such youth based on their symptom
profiles and identified unique patterns of amygdala functional connectivity in each class.
Subjects were 215 youth who varied along major symptom dimensions
commonly associated with pediatric affective psychopathology: depression, irritability,
anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD). We used latent profile analysis to
identify classes of symptom patterns. Functional MRI data were obtained while subjects
completed a gender identification task of face-emotions that varied in emotion type and
intensity. We used generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis to examine
associations between the probability of being in each symptom class and amygdala
functional connectivity.
The likelihood of being in the class with high parent-reported irritability and ADHD
symptoms was associated with amygdala connectivity to the insula and superior
temporal gyrus while processing high-intensity angry and fearful faces; to the precuneus
while processing intensity across emotions; and to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
across all task conditions. The likelihood of being in the class with high anxious and
depressive symptoms was negatively associated with amygdala-thalamic connectivity
across task conditions.
This is the first study to identify distinct associations between symptom profile
classes and amygdala connectivity in a transdiagnostic sample of youth. These neural
correlates provide external validity to latent classes derived from symptom clusters. This

Neural Response by Symptom Dimensions

Introduction
Youth presenting for mental health care often have multiple symptoms and
diagnoses, complicating the prescription of targeted treatment interventions. One way to
address this complexity is to use person-centered approaches to understand the
pathophysiology underlying different patterns of co-occurring symptoms (Friston et al,
2017; Insel, 2009). With the development of mixture models for detecting
subpopulations, it is now possible to classify individuals by naturally-occurring symptom
patterns, or profiles (Goodman, 1974; Hagenaars and McCutcheon, 2002). Recently,
using dimensions of psychopathology, we classified youth empirically into broad profile
classes (Kircanski et al, 2017). However, to improve diagnosis and treatment, it is
essential to validate these classes such as by identifying their neural basis. Here, we
take this approach by assessing associations between profile classes and amygdala
connectivity while processing face-emotions.
In prior work, we used a type of mixture model, latent profile analysis (LPA), and
parent and child symptom report to classify 509 youth participating in psychiatric
research on affective psychopathology. The analysis generated five profile classes,
including groups, which were characterized by 1) low levels of all symptoms (52% of
sample); 2) moderate anxious and mild depressive symptoms (17%); 3) high parentreported irritability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms (16%); 4) high irritability
and mixed comorbid symptoms (10%); and 5) high levels of all symptoms (5%). These
five classes had differential, expected associations with demographics and severity.
However, an important limitation of this and other symptom-based classifications is its
reliance on measures without a known biological basis.

An understanding of the neural mechanisms mediating different symptom
patterns would advance diagnosis, support treatment development, and facilitate
precision medicine initiatives (Insel, 2009). Indeed, recent examinations of data-rich
brain connectivity images reveal meaningful associations between brain function and
such data-driven, symptom-based classifications. These efforts are already showing
promise for elucidating biologically-driven subtypes of mental illnesses (Drysdale et al,
2017; Karalunas et al, 2014; Satterthwaite et al, 2016; Tamminga et al, 2014; Van Dam
et al, 2017) and guiding treatment selection (Doehrmann et al, 2013; Dunlop et al,
2017).
The goal of this study is to validate our empirical profile classes by examining
their unique associations with amygdala-based functional connectivity during faceemotion processing. Amygdala networks underlying emotion regulation and threat
processing are implicated in the affective symptoms that characterize our target
population (Bebko et al, 2015; Hafeman et al, 2017; Jalbrzikowski et al; Karalunas et al,
2014; Kujawa et al, 2016; Stoddard et al, 2017). Indeed, amygdala connectivity during
face-emotion processing may be a more reliable measure than either activation or
behavior (White et al, 2016). Thus, task-based amygdala connectivity is a promising
candidate for fMRI-based biomarker studies of affective psychopathology.
Here, we examine data from 215 youth who completed a commonly-used
implicit face-emotion processing fMRI task. We used a data-driven method to classify
individuals by symptom profile and assessed associations between task-related
amygdala connectivity and membership in a symptom profile class. We expected to find
associations between class membership and connectivity within amygdala-based

circuitry previously implicated in face-emotion processing and pediatric affective
psychopathology, in particular amygdala-prefrontal (Hafeman et al, 2017; Jalbrzikowski
et al; Stoddard et al, 2014; White et al, 2017) and amygdala-insular (Bebko et al, 2015;
Karalunas et al, 2014; White et al, 2017) circuitry have been found to associated with
specific aspects of affective psychopathology in youth. We also used a whole brain,
exploratory approach to examine associations between brain activity and membership
in a symptom profile class (Friston, 2011).
Methods
Participants and Measures
The sample included 215 youth (45.6% female) aged 7 through 18 years [M (SD)
=13.6 (2.7) years] who participated in research at the NIMH between 2012 and 2015
and completed an fMRI implicit emotion processing task. Participants were initially
recruited into the following groups based on primary diagnosis: anxiety disorder (ANX,
n=42, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety
disorder), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD, n=44), attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n=32), bipolar I or II disorder (BD, n=16). The
sample also included subjects who had a first-degree relative with bipolar disorder (“at
risk” AR, n=35), and those with no psychopathology (healthy volunteers, HV, n=46). Of
the 215 participants, 185 were also included in our original LPA of 509 youth (Kircanski
et al, 2017); however, that study did not include neuroimaging data. Additionally, 113 of
the 215 subjects contributed imaging data to a study of the effects of irritability and
anxiety on amygdala connectivity during implicit face-emotion processing (Stoddard et

al, 2017). Thus, the current study contains data in an additional 112 subjects, beyond
those appearing in this prior imaging paper. Comparisons among samples and results
of this study, Kircanski et al, (2017) and Stoddard et al, (2017) are detailed in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
The clinical assessment and behavioral measures are as described by Kircanski
et al, (2017). Exclusion criteria for all groups were unstable medical conditions, autism
spectrum disorder, substance use within 2 months prior to scan, head trauma, and
intelligence quotient (IQ) <70. Individuals who did not complete a scan or had poor task
performance (<65% accuracy) were not included. Ten otherwise eligible youth
completed a scan but were excluded due to poor scan quality or processing errors
(Table S1).
The study was approved by the NIMH Institutional Review Board. Written
informed consent was obtained from parents and assent from children. Families were
paid for participation.
To maximize accrual, relatives were allowed in this study, resulting in 18 sibling
pairs and 4 sibling triads. To ensure that results were not due to sibship, results were
confirmed in analyses that included only one randomly chosen individual per sibling
group (n=189; Table S2).
The sum of items of each of the parent- and self-report Affective Reactivity Index
(ARI) (Stringaris et al, 2012) provided two measures of irritability. The sum of items of
each of the parent- and self-report Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders
(SCARED) (Birmaher et al, 1999) provided two measures of anxiety. The sum of items

of the self-report Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) (Kovacs, 1978) measured
depressive symptoms. The ADHD Index T-score on the Conner’s Parent Rating Scale
(CPRS) (Conners, 1989) measured ADHD symptoms. Differing from Kircanski et al,
(2017), we used the ADHD Index T-score rather than the sum of ADHD subscale items
to represent ADHD symptoms.
Relationships among symptom reports, age, intelligence, gender, and motion
during scanning are presented in Table 1.
Latent Profile Analysis
As in our original LPA (Kircanski et al, 2017), manifest variables in the LPA were
separate parent- and child-reported ARI and SCARED scores, but only self-reported
CDI and parent-reported CPRS scores. To be included in the LPA, a measure must
have been collected within 60 days of scanning. Up to 15% of items could be missing
on any measure; missing items were imputed from remaining items. Of 215 participants,
129 had a complete set of six measures, 49 had five, 16 had four, and 21 had three or
fewer. There were no relationships between missing a measure and age, intelligence,
or gender (p’s>0.45). Missing a measure was not related to ultimate class assignment
(p=0.49). Given the wide range in age, standardized residuals from each measure
regressed on age were entered into the LPA.
We used Mplus Version 7.4 (Muthén and Muthén, 1998) to derive latent classes.
The parameters were the same as in the original analysis (Kircanski et al, 2017), except
the number of classes. As described in the introduction, the original analysis yielded a
5-class solution. Here, a 4-class solution (entropy=0.78) resulted in the most similar set

of categories, in terms of symptom profile and class assignment in the overlapping
samples (Supplementary Materials and Methods). The four classes were characterized
by high levels of all symptoms (Hi Sx), low levels of all symptoms (Lo Sx), moderate
irritability and ADHD symptoms (Irr/ADHD), and moderate anxiety and depressive
symptoms (Anx/Dep) (Figure 1). Differences in the number of classes reflect
differences in the samples included in the current, vs. the original, LPA (Supplementary
Materials and Methods). Largely because the current study required that participants be
suitable for fMRI, it had 294 fewer subjects than the original study. Of the 185
participants included in both Kircanski et al. (2017) and the current study, 70% were
assigned to the corresponding group in both studies (Supplementary Materials and
Methods). The original analysis also contained a “moderate irritability and mixed
comorbid symptoms,” which in this study was evenly distributed among the current Hi
Sx and Irr/ADHD groups.
Probability of Class Assignment
Individuals differ in the in their goodness of fit to the classes identified by the
group analysis (Figure 1). Mixture modeling, like the LPA used here, can account for
this individual variation by providing the probability of an individual’s assignment to each
class. Using the probability of class assignment as a predictor (instead of class
assignment per se) avoids the assumption that there are no differences between
individuals within a class (Whalen, 2017). Also, by using the probability of class
assignment in our analysis, we can weigh the influence of each person on the results,
making the analysis dimensional and hence more powerful. Thus, we used the LPA
probability of class assignment in our analyses. We denote this as Pclass overall or, for

the probability of being in a specific class, by P and a subscript corresponding to the
class, e.g., PLoSx.
fMRI Task
During fMRI, participants labelled the gender of happy, angry, and fearful faceemotion pictures from 10 actors (Ekman and Friesen, 1976). Stimuli with varying
intensity of expression (50%, 100% and 150%) were created by morphing emotional
faces with neutral faces. Face stimuli were presented in random order for 2s followed by
a jittered fixation cross (mean duration1.4s, range 0.5-6s). Trials were divided into 3
blocks with a total of 30 trials for each emotion by intensity condition and 90 neutral
face-emotion trials (Stoddard et al, 2017).
Imaging Procedures
Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were acquired on a General Electric 3.0 Tesla
scanner with a 32-channel head coil. Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal was
measured by echoplanar imaging (EPI) at 2.5 x 2.5 x 3.0mm voxel resolution resampled
to 2.5mm isotropic. One mm isotropic T1 images for anatomic registration and nonlinear
normalization were acquired with a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient
echo sequence (MPRAGE; flip angle = 7 degrees, minimum full echo time, inversion
time = 425ms, acquisition voxel size = 1 mm isotropic). All images were visually
inspected for acquisition artifact and proper registration. This work used the
computational resources of the NIH HPC Biowulf cluster (http://hpc.nih.gov).
Images were processed using FreeSurfer (Ségonne et al, 2004) and Analysis of
Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) (Cox, 1996) software. MPRAGE images were

uniformity corrected and skull stripped with FreeSurfer (Ségonne et al, 2004) and
normalized via nonlinear registration to AFNI’s TT_N27 Taliarach-space template. EPI
images were processed by removing the first four pre-magnetization volumes, limiting
each voxel’s BOLD signal to four standard deviations from the mean trend of its time
series, correcting for slice timing, affine volume to volume and volume to anatomic
registration, smoothing using a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, and scaling to a mean of
100.
Processed, scaled EPI were then entered into a general linear model (GLM) with
the following parameters: a cubic detrending polynomial, a regressor for each of six
translational and rotational motion parameters, physiologic noise regressors (one each
for the first 3 principle components of all voxels timeseries in an eroded white matter
and lateral ventricle mask (Behzadi et al, 2007), a 2 second block-GAM convolved
regressor for each emotion by intensity stimulus class, neutral faces, and inaccurate
trials. The residuals from this GLM were then entered into a generalized
psychophysiologic interaction analysis (gPPI; McLaren et al, 2012).
For amygdala connectivity, we averaged timeseries from processed, scaled EPI
signal across voxels within each amygdala defined by the AFNI DKD_MPM atlas. For
each subject, each of the average amygdala timeseries was partitioned by task
condition for gPPI regressors (Stoddard et al, 2017). For each amygdala, the residuals
from the single subject GLM were entered into a, second GLM with the regressors from
the first model in addition to gPPI regressors and a regressor for the average amygdala
timeseries. In the second GLM only, EPI volumes were censored from this GLM
regression by three criteria: 1) motion shift, defined as movement exceeding a

Euclidean distance of 1 mm from its preceding volume, 2) volumes immediately
preceding such a motion shift, and 3) volumes with >10% voxels at outlying time points.
Subjects were excluded if more than 15% of their volumes were censored or their mean
censored volume to volume Euclidean displacement was more than or equal to 0.2mm
(Table S1). Parameter estimates for gPPI regressors for each emotion by intensity
represent the amplitude of connectivity and were entered into second-level group
analyses.
Analyses
Analyses were conducted in AFNI or R (R Core Team, 2014). All omnibus
analyses used a linear mixed-effects model-based ANOVA implemented in 3dLME
(Chen et al, 2014) for images or in the lme function in R package nlme (Singmann et al,
2015) for behavior or post hoc analyses of imaging results.
The ANOVA tested the fully interactive effects of each Probability of Class
Assignment (Pclass) with Emotion and Intensity, except that no term could include an
interaction between two or more Pclass. Age, Motion (mean Euclidean distance), and
Gender were covariates. Emotion and Intensity were modeled as within-subjects
factors with three levels (Emotion: Happy, Angry, Fearful; Intensity: 50%, 100%, 150%).
Age and Motion were between-subjects, continuous variables centered at their mean
across the sample. Gender was a between-subjects factor. Subject was a random
factor. Because PLoSx was anticorrelated to each of PHiSx, PIrr/ADHD, and PAnx/Dep, it was
not included to prevent variance inflation by multicollinearity.

For behavioral analyses, percent correct gender identification (accuracy) and
mean reaction time for trials with correct gender identification were dependent variables.
For imaging analyses, amygdala connectivity during each emotion by intensity
condition, relative to fixation, were dependent variables. Results from these models may
be interpreted as the unique association between Pclass by Emotion and Intensity to
behavior or amygdala connectivity.
The imaging analysis was conducted across a whole brain mask, including only
voxels where data existed for at least 90% of subjects. The primary voxelwise p-value
threshold was set at 0.005. Multiple testing was corrected to α = 0.05 over the whole
experiment, Bonferroni corrected for two group tests. This was done via Monte Carlo
simulation with a Gaussian plus exponential term spatial autocorrelation function to
estimate smoothness (3dClustSim with –acf option; α threshold= 0.05/2= 0.025) (Cox et
al, 2016). The resultant cluster size threshold was 100 contiguous voxels, each sharing
at least one edge with its neighbor. Clusters are reported with size (k) and coordinates
of the peak of a cluster with RAI convention in Taliarach space. For further descriptive
analysis of each functional ROI, mean values of connectivity at each emotion by
intensity were extracted via AFNI’s 3dROIstat.
For post hoc analyses, we fit mixed effects models using the same formula as
fMRI group analysis. We used general linear tests (Pillai’s Trace) of specific contrasts or
fixed effects, adjusting for all others in R package phia (De Rosario-Martinez, 2013).
These were Holm-Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. To minimize Type I
error, significance tests were re-run without influential participants. Influential
participants were defined by a Cook’s Distance > 0.02, a threshold based on the sample

size and number of model parameters (Fox, 1991). Any result no longer significant
when influential subjects were removed was not reported.
Results
All results are of associations between behavior or brain function and the degree
to which an individual is associated with an LPA class (Probability of Class Assignment,
Pclass, Figure 1). PAnx/Dep > 0.1 for n=100; PIrr/ADHD > 0.1 for n=61; PHiSx > 0.1 for n=20.
Behavior
There were no associations between any Pclass and reaction time or accuracy.
Unique Associations of Amygdala Connectivity to Symptom Classes
For regions showing unique associations between each symptom class and
amygdala connectivity, see Table 2 and Figure 2. Classes were associated with task
modulated amygdala connectivity in six regions.
Specifically, PIrr/ADHD interacted with emotion and intensity to influence left
amygdala connectivity to a region including the left insula and superior temporal gyrus
(F4,1688=6.96, p<.001). In this interaction, increasing PIrr/ADHD was associated with
decreased connectivity in response to 150% fearful and 150% angry faces, both relative
to 150% happy (all p’s <.001). PIrr/ADHD also interacted with intensity to influence right
amygdala connectivity to the bilateral precuneus (F1,1688=9.8, p<.001). Across all
emotions, increasing PIrr/ADHD was associated with increased amygdala-precuneus at
50% intensity relative to either 100% or 150% intensity (p’s<.02). Finally, there was a
main effect of PIrr/ADHD on left amygdala connectivity on the left lateral orbitofrontal

cortex (F1,208=21.5, p<.001). Specifically, increasing PIrr/ADHD was associated with
decreased connectivity across all stimuli (r=-.31).
A main effect of PAnx/Dep on left amygdala to right thalamic connectivity
(F1,208=22.7, p<.001) was explained by an association between increasing PAnx/Dep and
decreased connectivity across all stimuli (r=-.28).
PHiSx interacted with emotion and intensity to influence right amygdala
connectivity to a region that included the left lingual and occipital gyri (F4,1688=9.5,
p<.001). Post hoc contrasts showed this interaction was significant at 50% intensity
only. At that intensity, increasing PHiSx was associated with increased connectivity in
response to happy vs. fearful faces (p <0.001). PHiSx also interacted with intensity to
influence right amygdala connectivity to the right superior temporal gyrus (F2,1688=12.5,
p<.001). Specifically, increasing PHiSx was associated with increased connectivity in
response to 150% intensity, vs. either 100% or 150% intensity (p’s<.001).
Post hoc analyses assessing the effects of medication for all regions of interest
are presented in Table S3. All findings held, except that the PIrr/ADHD by emotion by
intensity interaction did not survive the exclusion of individuals taking stimulant
medication.
Discussion
In a large, transdiagnostic clinical sample of youth, we aimed to identify neural
correlates of empirically-defined symptom profiles. We found that, under certain
conditions of face-emotion processing, specific regional changes in amygdala
connectivity are associated with the likelihood of a specific symptom profile. This study

is novel in applying task-based functional connectivity to validate a person-centered
clustering of symptoms, which extends (Kircanski et al, 2017). As discussed below, the
likelihood of being in the symptom class characterized by moderate parent irritability
and ADHD symptoms (PIrr/ADHD) was associated with amygdala connectivity to frontal,
temporal, and insular areas often associated with social or emotional functions. The
likelihood of being in the high anxiety/depression class (PAnx/Dep) was associated with
amygdala connectivity in thalamic regions involved in emotion processing.
PIrr/ADHD had several unique associations to neural response to face-emotions. First,
PIrr/ADHD was associated with amygdala-insula/superior temporal gyrus connectivity while
responding to high-intensity angry or fearful faces, relative to happy faces. This
association may represent a specific amygdala circuitry response to social threat in
those expressing irritability/ADHD symptoms. Second, PIrr/ADHD was associated
specifically with changes in amygdala-precuneus connectivity by intensity of faceemotion. A relevant, earlier finding was that, across face-emotions, emotion intensity
influenced amygdala activation in youth with DMDD (Wiggins et al, 2016). Like the
irritability/ADHD class in this work, DMDD in the prior study was characterized by
irritability and, in most patients, ADHD. These two associations with PIrr/ADHD also
correspond to a report by Karalunas et al, (2014) on an irritable subtype of ADHD.
Specifically, the irritable subtype of ADHD in Karalunas et al, (2014) was associated

supports further investigation of the irritable/ADHD phenotype in youth as a valid
psychiatric construct with a specific neural basis.
PIrr/ADHD was also associated with amygdala dysconnectivity to the ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex across task conditions. In patients with irritability, ventrolateral
prefrontal dysfunction has been reported in several experimental contexts, including
reversal learning (Adleman et al, 2011), reward processing (Bebko et al, 2014), and
face-emotion processing (Coccaro et al, 2007). Consistent with this literature, general
amygdala dysconnectivity to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex has been associated with
a tendency towards anger in adults (Fulwiler et al, 2012).
PAnx/Dep was associated with a task-general decrease in connectivity between the
amygdala and the mediodorsal and lateral aspects of the thalamus. The amygdala and
thalamus are core limbic regions consistently activated in fMRI studies of emotion
(Kober et al, 2008); each contain nuclei that mediate emotional processing in human
and animal studies (Metzger et al, 2013). Consistent with our results, specific
amygdala-thalamic connections have been implicated in fear and anxiety, though their
extent and functional significance is unknown (Tovote et al, 2015).
Thus, convergence with prior work strengthens the conclusion that these circuits are
involved specifically in the expression of irritability/ADHD vs. anxiety/depressive
symptoms, suggesting an underlying pathophysiology and objective markers of these
clinical presentations. This study goes beyond prior work by directly assessing unique
associations of brain circuitry with these common symptom presentations.

Neural Response by Symptom Dimensions

This study has several limitations. Given its exploratory nature, replication is needed.
Small associations between the class probabilities and motion or gender may bias
findings, particularly for the probability of having comorbid irritability and ADHD
symptoms. However, the associations are acceptable for applying linear models, we
took efforts to minimize these potentially confounding effects, and our findings are
concordant with the emerging literature. In addition, associations with high parent
reported irritability should be interpreted as preliminary given the small fraction of the
sample with this presentation. For task effects on amygdala connectivity to the insula
and superior temporal gyrus, we cannot disentangle the effects of stimulant use from
the probability of having comorbid irritability and ADHD. This finding does highlight a
general limitation in clinical research – that it is unethical to withdraw severely ill youth
from medication for fMRI research. Future research will need to address the
confounding physiologic effects of stimulants and other medications.
We provide early evidence that patterns of amygdala connectivity during faceemotion processing differ among classes of affective symptom presentations in youth.
Future research may replicate these findings as well as their diagnostic specificity and
relationship to clinical outcomes.

Figure 1. Two views of clinical data for the LPA four-class solution. The left panel is a
profile plot with a line for each class. They are low symptoms on all measures (LoSx),
relatively higher parent report of irritability and ADHD symptoms (Irr/ADHD), relatively
higher anxiety and depression symptoms (ANX/Dep), and high symptoms on all
measures (HiSx). We regressed each symptom measure (x-axis) on age across the
whole sample and then entered the resultant standardized residuals into LPA. For each
LPA class, the mean of these standardized residuals are plotted on the y-axis. Thus, the
y-axis is a common scale for all measures, with a score of zero representing the mean
score of each measure across the entire sample. The lines for each class may be
interpreted as the characteristic symptom level on each measure for members of the
class.
The right panel represents individuals with a complete set of measures (n=129) plotted
by symptom dimension. We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to collapse all six
clinical measures into two components (MDS1 and MDS2) for visualization. As
expected, the first component (MDS1) separates individuals by overall degree of
symptomatology, i.e. general severity. Plot points have colors and shapes by LPA class.
Individuals assigned to each LPA class cluster together by MDS symptom dimensions,
suggesting agreement between MDS and LPA methods. However, the proximity of
individuals at class-cluster borders suggests individuals assigned to one class may be
similar to individuals assigned to another class in symptoms. This supports our analytic
approach of using class probability rather than class assignment to preserve information
on uncertainty of class assignment.

Figure 2. One representative slice of each region of interest at coordinates denoted in
Table 2. Below the slices are bar graphs of the relative variance of amygdala
connectivity explained by each of the three probabilities of being in an LPA class. From
left to right on the x axis the class probabilities are A=Anx/Dep, I=Irr/ADHD, and
H=HiSx. The term with which the class probabilities interact is denoted by the title of
each bar graph, with Int=Intensity, Emo=Emotion, and Main=the main effect of the class
probability. The y-axis represents the terms’ F value, or ratio of variance explained by
the term to noise. Because they have the same degrees of freedom, each bar may be
interpreted as the connectivity explained by each of the class probabilities relative to
each other. Overall, these graphs demonstrate that task-modulated amygdala
connectivity is best accounted for by a specific class probability.
