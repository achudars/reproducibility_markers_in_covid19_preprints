Abstract

23

Background: To sustain the efficacy of malaria vector control, the World Health

24

Organization (WHO) recommends the combination of effective tools. Before designing and

25

implementing additional strategies in any setting, it is critical to monitor or predict when and

26

where transmission occurs. However, to date, very few studies have quantified the

27

behavioural interactions between humans and Anopheles vectors. Here, we characterized

28

residual transmission in a rural area of Burkina Faso where long lasting insecticidal nets

29

(LLIN) are widely used.

30

Methods: We analysed data on both human and malaria vectors behaviours from 27 villages

31

to measure hourly human exposure to vector bites in dry and rainy seasons using

32

mathematical models. We estimated the protective efficacy of LLINs and characterised where

33

(indoors vs. outdoors) and when both LLIN users and non-users were exposed to vector bites.

34

Results: The percentage of the population who declared sleeping under a LLIN the previous

35

night was very high regardless of the season, with an average LLIN use ranging from 92.43%

36

to 99.89%. The use of LLIN provided > 80% protection against exposure to vector bites. The

37

proportion of exposure for LLIN users was 29-57% after 05:00 and 0.05-12 % before 20:00.

38

More than 80% of exposure occurred indoors for LLIN users and the estimate reached 90%

39

for children under five years old in the dry cold season.

40

Conclusions: This study supports the current use of LLIN as a primary malaria vector control

41

tool. It also emphasises the need to complement LLIN with indoor-implemented measures

42

such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and/or house improvement to effectively combat

43

malaria in the rural area of Diébougou. Furthermore, malaria elimination programmes would

44

also require strategies that target outdoor biting vectors to be successful in the area.

Background

47

Massive distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is a core intervention for

48

malaria control in Burkina Faso. Scaling-up of coverage with LLIN in sub-Saharan Africa has

49

been very successful between 2000 and 2015 during which malaria morbidity and mortality

50

have dropped considerably [1]. Unfortunately, this significant progress is stalling or even

51

reversing in some countries. Burkina Faso is indeed one of the sixteen (16) in the world that

52

documented an increase in malaria burden from 2016 to 2017 [2]. This trend might be

53

attributed to the recent increases in prevalence and strength of pyrethroid resistance in malaria

54

vectors [3–5]. Another possible cause is the development of behavioural resistance in vector

55

populations [6–8]. In sub-Saharan Africa, there have been many reports of changes in vector

56

species and/or vector biting behaviours to avoid contact with LLIN [6–8]. Such changes in

57

vector populations are considered by many specialists as an important threat for indoor

58

control strategies such as LLIN [9, 10].

59

To sustain the efficacy of vector control, the WHO recommends the combination of effective

60

tools [11]. At present, there are a number of recommended tools available and many others

61

under development that can potentially be combined with LLIN [12, 13]. However, national

62

malaria control programs (NMCPs) are now facing challenges to design effective control

63

strategies due to high variations in malaria epidemiology between and even within countries

64

[14]. To do so, NMCP must be able to monitor or predict when and where transmission

65

occurs. Entomological data alone are not sufficient to address this question, missing

66

information about behaviours of local human populations in order to measure/predict human

67

exposure to malaria vectors bite [15–17]. Unfortunately, only few studies to date have

68

quantified and characterized human exposure to malaria vectors bites by analysing data on

69

both human and vector behaviours [17].

70

The present work is a baseline study conducted in the Diébougou area, southwest Burkina

71

Faso, to quantify the behavioural interactions between humans and Anopheles mosquitoes.

72

Results of the entomological surveys previously reported [18] were used in combination with

73

human behavioral data to study human exposure to Anopheles vector bites. The work is part

74

of a large randomized control trial designed to investigate whether the combination of LLINs

75

with other vector control tools can provide additional protection over malaria cases and

76

transmission. The trial was carried out in Southwest Burkina Faso where malaria vectors

77

shows high levels of pyrethroid resistance.

78
79

Methods

80

This study was conducted in 27 villages located in the Diébougou health district, southwest

81

Burkina Faso in order to collect baseline data for a randomized controlled trial (Fig. 1). These

82

villages were selected based on geographical (distance between two villages higher than 2 km

83

and accessibility during the rainy season) and demographic (a population size ranging from

84

200 to 500 inhabitants) criteria [18]. The climate in the study area is tropical with one dry

85

season from October to April (including a cold period from December to February and a hot

86

period from March to April) and one rainy season from May to September. Average daily

87

temperature amplitudes are 18-36°C, 25-39°C and 23-33°C in dry cold, dry hot and rainy

88

season, respectively. The mean annual rainfall is 1200 mm. The natural vegetation is

89

dominated by wooded savannah dotted with clear forest gallery. The main economic activity

90

is agriculture (cotton growing and cereals) followed by artisanal gold mining and production

91

of coal and wood [19, 20].

95

landing mosquitoes both indoors and outdoors from 17:00 h to 09:00 h in 4 houses per

96

villages during one night [18]. All the mosquitoes collected were morphologically identified

97

[21,22] and Anopheles spp. mosquitoes were subsequently identified to the species level by

98

polymerase chain reaction [23–25]. Detailed descriptions of the methods used are provided in

99

our previous publication [18]. Overall, Anopheles funestus s.s was the main malaria vector in

100

the study area during the dry cold season [18]. During the dry hot and rainy seasons,

101

Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae s.s were the dominant species. The mean

102

endophagy rate (ER) of malaria vectors was 63.23%, 50.18% and 57.18% during the dry cold,

103

dry hot and rainy seasons, respectively [18].

104

In order to obtain appropriate data regarding relevant human behaviours, we surveyed 401

105

and 339 randomly selected households in dry (February to April 2017) and rainy (September

106

2017) seasons, respectively (corresponding to an average of 15 and 13 households per

107

village). Among people usually leaving in each selected household, we randomly selected 3

108

persons (maximum) belonging to each of the 3 following age groups: 0-5 years old, 6-17

109

years old and ≥ 18 years old. We asked the head of the household the time at which each

110

selected person (1) entered and exited his own house the night preceding the survey and (2)

111

the time each LLIN user entered and exited his sleeping space the night preceding the survey

112

[16]. In order to know the relative weight of each age group in the population, we recorded

113

the number of individuals belonging to these groups in each households. A total of 3045 and

114

2880 individuals were surveyed representing 35.08% and 33.17 % of the 27 villages’

115

population according to a census carried out by our team in 2016 [18]. The human

116

behavioural surveys were carried out using tablets running Open Data Kit (ODK) forms.

117

We used data from the human and Anopheles spp behavioural surveys to measure the human

118

exposure to Anopheles spp. bites in dry season (cold and hot) and rainy season using

119

mathematical models as previously described in Killeen et al. [15] and Moiroux et al. [16].

120

We estimated the average true personal protection of using a LLIN (i.e. the proportion of

121

exposure to all bites occurring both indoors and outdoors that is prevented by using a LLIN)

122

as well as the proportion of exposure which occurred indoors for LLIN users either

123

accounting for the personal protection provided by net use or ignoring it to compare with

124

available estimates for unprotected people. Exposure when sleeping under a LLIN was

125

assumed to be reduced by 92% [16]. Moreover, to characterize residual transmission, we

126

calculated the proportion of exposure occurring before 20:00 and after 5:00 (i.e. the times

127

preceding and following the period when most (>50%) of LLIN users are protected).

128

All the exposure values were calculated at the village and study area levels, for each age

129

group as well as for the total population. Because the number of individuals sampled per age

130

group in each household is the same, the relative proportions of each age group in our sample

131

are equal and do not reflect the relative proportions in the population. We therefore predicted

132

the average number of people being indoors, outdoors and under nets at the population levels

133

by summing weighted numbers of people of each age group. For these calculation and to

134

produce figures, we used an R [26] package named “biteExp” developed by our team.

135
136

Results

137

The average declared LLIN use rate was very high in the study population ranging from

138

95.49% in the dry season to 99.67% in the rainy season (Table 1). The declared LLIN use rate

139

was higher in the 0-5 years old age group (97.87% in the dry season to 100% in the rainy

140

season) compared to children aged 6-17 years old (95.36% in the dry season to 99.79% in the

141

rainy season) and adults (92.45% in the dry season to 99.19% in the rainy season) (Table 1).

142

However, we found that the LLIN use rate varied among villages (see Additional file 1) with

143

the lowest rates observed in Kpédia (68.42%), Palembera (71.73%) and Diagnon (78.78%) in

144

the adults group during the dry season. In the other villages, during dry and rainy seasons,

145

LLIN use rates ranged from 80 to 100% whatever the season (see Additional file 1). Figure 2

146

shows humans and Anopheles behavior profiles as well as average hourly exposure and

147

prevented exposure to bites for LLIN users in our study area.

148

The majority of the population was indoors from 20:00 in both dry and rainy seasons (Figs.

149

2A, 2B and 2C). These populations woke up around 05:00 in the early morning in all seasons

150

(Figs. 2A, 2B and 2C). Most of the total exposure to Anopheles bites occurred indoors (>

151

94%, Table 1) but was largely preventable by using of LLIN (Figs. 2D, 2E and 2F). Indeed,

152

LLIN were estimated to provide average ‘true’ personal protection against 84.93%, 80.89%

153

and 82.82% of exposure in dry cold season, dry hot season and rainy season, respectively

154

(Table 1, Additional file 2). The peak of exposure for users occurred indoors between 05:00

155

and 06:00 just before sunrise whatever the season (Figs.2D, 2E and 2F). On average, between

156

33 and 57% of residual exposure of LLIN users occurred after wake up (after 5:00) depending

157

on age groups. Early bites (before 20:00) represented less than 12 % of the residual exposure

158

of LLIN users (Table 1).

Discussion

173

The average declared LLIN use rate was very high (>95%) in all age groups of our study

174

population. The LLIN use rate was slightly higher in children under five years of age than the

175

rest of the population. This finding is consistent with results from a multi-country analysis

176

that revealed that the most vulnerable groups are preferentially protected by LLIN in sub-

177

Saharan Africa [27]. At the village level, the use rate rarely fall under 80%, being consistently

178

higher than the nationwide LLIN use value of 67% published by WHO in 2017 [28]. This

179

may be explained by the fact that the study was conducted approximately 6 months after a

180

wide LLIN distribution. However, our reported LLIN use may be overestimated because it

181

was based on self-reported survey questions, the most commonly used method to assess

182

bednet use [29]. To more accurately estimate LLIN use, future studies quantifying human

183

exposure to mosquito bites should consider using other measurement methods such as

184

electronic monitoring devices [30, 31].

185

This study shows that the overall protective efficacy of LLINs against vector bites in the rural

186

area of Diébougou was high (80-85 %) during the three seasons. Our estimates for LLIN

187

personal efficacy were comparable with those found in Benin (80% and 87%) [16] but were

188

higher than those reported elsewhere such as in Kenya (51 %) [32] and Tanzania (70%, 59%

189

and 38%) [15, 33]. Our results support strongly the use of LLIN as a primary malaria vector

190

control tool in the area. Nevertheless, such a protection level (85% in average) has to be put

191

into perspective with the high malaria transmission and endemicity [18] in order to

192

measure/realize the importance of malaria residual transmission in the area.

193

We estimated that 33-57% of residual exposure to Anopheles bites of LLIN users occurred

194

after 5:00 and 0.07-12% occurred before 20:00 when most of users are awake. The proportion

195

of exposure for LLIN users has been higher in the late part of the morning than in the early

196

part of the evening in some settings while the opposite trend has been observed in other

197

settings [15, 16, 34, 35]. In our study area, over 80% of human exposure to vector bites

198

occurred indoors for LLIN users. For children under five years who use LLINs, the exposure

199

rate occurring indoors reached 90%. Therefore, these results suggest that adding other indoor

200

intervention such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) to LLINs would be relevant to reduce

201

malaria transmission in the rural area of Diébougou. In 2017, 28 countries in the world have

202

implemented IRS in combination with LLINs to combat malaria [2]. IRS contributed to an

203

estimated 10 (5–14)% of the reduction in malaria burden achieved recently [36]. When used

204

together, IRS and LLINs are expected to target vectors at different stages of their gonotrophic

205

cycle using insecticides with different mode of action. However, trials assessing the impact of

206

the combination IRS+LLIN over LLIN use alone have yielded conflicting results [37–42].

207

House improvement is another indoor measure which needs careful consideration and deep

208

investigations. Indeed, house improvement has been strongly associated with reduced malaria

209

transmission and disease in many studies [44–46]. The main house improvement interventions

210

studied are closed eaves, closed ceilings, window screens and metal-roof houses as opposed to

211

eaves, ceilings, windows openings and thatched-roof houses. Such improvements protect

212

against malaria by providing physical barriers that prevent vectors from entering houses and

213

can reduce vector survivorship [44, 47]. Nonetheless, there is compelling evidence that even a

214

full coverage of effective measures within houses would not be sufficient to suppress

215

transmission of malaria in Africa [43].

216

In this study, we evidenced that a significant proportion of LLIN users exposure to vector

217

bites occurred outdoors (ranging from 9.48% to 30.43%), with the highest estimate recorded

218

in adults (over the age of 18 years old) during the dry hot season. Many studies conducted in

219

various areas of Africa reported similar or even higher estimates of exposure occurring

220

outdoors [15, 33, 35, 48]. Recently, a systematic review categorized Burkina Faso along with

221

Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, and Tanzania as countries with high levels of outdoor vector biting

222

[10]. However, our results do not fully support this categorization since we show that both

223

LLIN users and LLIN non users are far more exposed to vector bites indoors than outdoors in

224

the study area. Nevertheless, strategies targeting outdoor bites would probably be required to

225

achieve malaria elimination in the area.

226

Almost all the existing indoor vector control strategies face two important evolutive

227

challenges. First, they induce a strong selective pressure on physiological resistance in vector

228

populations because they almost all rely on synthetic chemicals [49]. Second, they also

229

induced selective pressure for behavioral changes in vector populations resulting in a reduced

230

contact with interventions [49]. In this context, there is a crucial need to monitor these

231

resistance mechanisms, as well as residual transmission, after the deployment of strategies to

232

inform decision makers in order to allow them to adapt their strategic plans.

233
234

Conclusions

235

This study showed that most of the population of the rural area of Diébougou reported using

236

LLINs the previous night. The use of LLIN prevented more than 80% of Anopheles bite

237

exposure. Nevertheless, LLIN users are still exposed to vector bites which occurred mostly

238

indoors in late morning. Therefore, complementary strategies that target indoor biting vectors

239

in combination with LLIN should be prioritized to control malaria in this area. However, as

240

vectors are able to behaviourally evolve in response to indoor control tool implementation,

241

successful malaria control programmes should also integrate monitoring of malaria vector

242

behaviours. Moreover, as it is predictable that outdoor biting phenotypes will be selected, it

243

urges to also evaluate and implement outdoor measures.

Declarations

251

Ethics approval and consent to participate

252

The protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee

253

of the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé (IEC-IRSS) and registered as

254

N°A06/2016/CEIRES. We received community agreement before the beginning of human

255

and Anopheles spp behavioral surveys. Behavioral surveys did not involved participants under

256

16 years old. Indeed, questionnaires were administrated only to the heads of households and

257

informations relative to children under 16 years old were therefore directly collected from

258

either a parent or guardian. All mosquito collectors involved in the entomological surveys

259

gave their informed consent but none of them were under 16 years old. Mosquito collectors

260

and supervisors received a vaccine against yellow fever as a prophylactic measure. Collectors

261

were treated free of charge for malaria according to WHO recommendations.
