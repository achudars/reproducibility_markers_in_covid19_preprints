The Effects of Metronome Frequency Differentially Affects Gait on a Treadmill and
Overground in People with Parkinson’s Disease

Abstract
Objective: To determine the effect of different metronome cue frequencies on spatiotemporal
gait parameters when walking overground compared to walking on a treadmill in people with
Parkinson’s disease
Design: Repeated-measures, within-subject design
Setting: Research laboratory
Participants: Twenty-one people with Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3)
Interventions: Participants walked overground and on a treadmill with and without metronome
cues of 85%, 100%, and 115% of their baseline cadence for one minute each.
Main Outcome Measures: Gait speed, step length, and cadence
Results: An interaction effect between cue frequency and walking environment revealed that
participants took longer steps during the 85% condition on the treadmill only. When walking
overground, metronome cues of 85% and 115% of baseline cadence yielded decreases and
increases, respectively, in both cadence and gait speed with no concomitant change in step
length.
Conclusions: These data suggest that people with PD are able to alter spatiotemporal gait
parameters immediately when provided the appropriate metronome cue and walking
environment. We propose to target shortened step lengths by stepping to the beat of slow
frequency auditory cues while walking on a treadmill, whereas the use of fast frequency cues
during overground walking can facilitate faster walking speeds.

Common gait alterations for individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) include decreased
stride length, increased variability of movement, freezing of gait, decreased gait speed, increased
double support time, and increased cadence.1-5 These gait abnormalities are associated with
decreased motor automaticity which begins to deteriorate in the early stages of PD.6 In an effort
to improve gait mechanics and quality of life for individuals with PD, physical therapy often
targets the rhythmicity of gait.7

Walking on a motorized treadmill can encourage more automatic gait for individuals with
PD, due to the continuous belt movement compared to the self-generating gait pattern performed
overground.8, 9 As a result, walking on a treadmill leads to decreased gait variability when
compared to overground gait.10 Even a single session of treadmill walking can elicit longer steps
for individuals with PD.11 This may be because individuals with advanced PD, unlike
unimpaired individuals, may take increased step lengths and decrease the cadence when walking
on a treadmill compared to walking overground.12 These observed changes in gait following
treadmill walking might be due to a combination of the proprioceptive input from the belt
displacement of the limbs, visual cues of the distance from the front of the treadmill, or the
constant velocity of the belt.10, 12

The use of rhythmic auditory cues has likewise successfully improved gait parameters in
people with PD.13, 14 Rhythmic auditory cueing presumably serves as an external auditory
stimulus to bypass the impaired internal timing present in PD.15, 16 Generally, the use of rhythmic
auditory cues has contributed to increases in gait speed and step lengths,13, 17, 18 although this
finding is inconsistent.5, 19 Importantly, however, the prescriptive literature has been narrowly

focused on the use of faster tempos of rhythmic auditory cueing.14 This is presumably because
most investigators primarily seek to increase gait velocity, and therefore suggest that cueing
should only be used at frequencies that match or exceed the individual’s baseline cadence.15, 20
Furthermore, the use of slower cueing frequencies has been suggested to increase falls risk.20

Of concern is that auditory cueing is intended to impact the temporal features of gait,21
but impacting step length may have a greater influence on gait for individuals with PD.5, 22 Gait
speed is a function of both temporal (e.g., cadence) and spatial (e.g., step length) features.23
Therefore, auditory cue-induced changes in cadence when walking overground may increase gait
speed, but without obliging an individual to increase step length. Furthermore, given the
potentially valuable role of walking on a treadmill for individuals with PD, 8, 10, 24 we are
concerned that increasing cadence with rhythmic auditory cueing while walking at a constant
treadmill speed will induce even shorter steps. Clearly, the environmental context of rhythmic
auditory cueing matters. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of
metronome cues on spatiotemporal gait parameters when walking overground compared to
walking on a treadmill in people with PD. This information will be critical in order to determine
the optimal training environment to achieve specific gait training goals. We hypothesize that
individuals with PD will increase step length with slow tempo metronome cueing during
treadmill walking due to the inability to change gait speed, but will increase step length
overground while stepping to fast tempo metronome cueing.

We recruited participants from the community via referrals from the Department of
Neurology and local PD support groups. All participants were diagnosed with PD by a physician,
and had a Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) Stage 1-3. Additional inclusion criteria included self-reported
ability to walk >10 m over ground and on a treadmill for at least 14 minutes with rest breaks as
needed. Exclusion criteria included H&Y Stage 4 and 5, uncontrolled
cardiorespiratory/metabolic disease, other neurologic/orthopedic disorders that affect gait, and
severe communication impairments that impeded understanding of study purpose and
procedures. All participants signed an informed consent form approved by the UNC-Chapel Hill
IRB. The project was listed on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03253965).

Procedures
Participants completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) prior to testing. To determine baseline gait speed,
each participant walked over a 20 ft pressure mat a with instruction to walk at their “comfortable
speed.” From this baseline testing, software b calculated baseline gait speed and cadence for each
participant, which was used to determine the treadmill speed and metronome frequencies for the
study.

Each participant performed four different walking conditions on both an instrumented
treadmill and overground, in a laboratory setting. These conditions consisted of a Control (no
metronome) and three metronome conditions of 85%, 100%, and 115% of the cadence from the
baseline overground testing. The Control (no cue) condition was always performed first and the
order of the metronome conditions was randomized using a random number generator run by the

investigators. The treadmill and overground tests were counterbalanced. We played the
metronome c through a speaker for all metronome conditions.

Overground Testing
Each participant walked over the 20 ft pressure mat for four passes of continuous walking
for each condition. No assistive devices were used. Instructions were given to “match each step
to the beat of the metronome.” The initial steps of each trial and the turns between each pass
were completed off the walkway and were not included in the data collection or analysis.
Standing rest breaks were given as needed between conditions.

Treadmill Testing
Participants walked on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill d for all treadmill conditions.
The treadmill speed was set to the gait speed from the initial baseline overground test, and
maintained for all conditions. For three subjects, the treadmill speed was reduced due to an
inability to reach the intended treadmill speed safely. Participants were discouraged from using
handrails to promote more natural gait mechanics, however, 12 participants required handrails
for balance only. For those cases, handrail use was maintained consistently across conditions. All
participants wore a harness attached overhead, but no body weight support was provided and the
harness did not restrict limb motion. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored for safety.
Rest breaks were provided as needed.

Instructions were given to “match each step to the beat of the metronome.” Participants
were given ~15 seconds to synchronize with the metronome each time the frequency was

changed, and data was then collected for one minute. As participants walked on the treadmill, the
positions of the feet were tracked using retro-reflective markers placed on both heels by an 8camera motion capture system e at 120 Hz. Ground reaction force data were sampled
simultaneously at 1200 Hz from the treadmill. Results of the treadmill testing make up a portion
of another report.25

Data Management
For all overground trials, we used the PKMAS software to remove partial steps and
calculate average step length, cadence, and gait speed from all remaining steps. Data were
processed separately for each condition. For all treadmill trials, data were analyzed with custom
Labview f programs. In particular, step length was measured as the anteroposterior distance
between heel markers at heel strike. Step time was calculated as the time, in seconds, between
successive heel strikes. Cadence was then calculated as the inverse of step time. We determined
cadence accuracy as the difference between the actual cadence and the intended cadence.

Data Analysis
We used SPSS g to perform separate two-way repeated measures ANOVAs (repeated for
metronome condition and walking environment) for step length, cadence, and cadence accuracy.
If significant effects were found, one-way ANOVAs or paired sample t-tests were used, as
appropriate. A Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparisons. Because gait
speed did not change on the treadmill, we used a one-way ANOVA to assess for changes in
overground gait speed. A p-value of 0.05 was used for significance. Prior to data collection, we
performed a power analysis using G*Power to determine an appropriate sample size. We were

unaware of any work that has compared faster and slower cue frequencies across walking
environments. However, we used an effect size (f > 0.39) based on differences in step length
between treadmill and overground26 and stride length differences between metronome cue
conditions.21 This assumption indicated that we would need 18 participants for an alpha of 0.05
and power of 0.80.

Results
Participants
We contacted 27 eligible participants, of whom 21 people with PD agreed to participate
(13 male, 8 female; 69.8±9.8 years old). The average MoCA score was 27±2.9. Participants had
experienced symptoms for 10.5±7.7 years prior to participation. Five of the participants were
classified as H&Y Stage 1, nine were classified as H&Y Stage 2, and seven were classified as
H&Y Stage 3. The average UPDRS score was 19.4±13.7 with the average motor axial subscore
of 4.8±3.5. Nine participants were classified as axial rigid and 12 as tremor predominant.

Gait Speed
The treadmill speed was kept constant for all conditions (1.10±0.26 m/s), however,
significant changes in gait speed were observed when stepping with different metronome
frequencies during overground walking (p<0.001, η2p=0.764, Figure 1). Overground gait speed
significantly increased for the 115% metronome condition (1.33±0.20 m/s; p<0.001; Cohen’s d:
1.39) and significantly decreased for the 85% metronome condition to 0.99±0.17 m/s (p=0.001;
Cohen’s d: 1.07) compared to Control (no cue) walking (1.15±0.21 m/s). We did not observe any

change in gait speed at the 100% metronome condition (1.19±0.19 m/s; p=0.512; Cohen’s d:
0.34).

Step Length
We observed a significant interaction effect between walking environment (treadmill vs
overground) and metronome frequency (p<0.001, η2p=0.554; Figure 2). We therefore assessed
the effect of metronome frequency on step length on the treadmill and overground, separately.
Here, we observed that step lengths were affected by the metronome frequency on the treadmill
only (p<0.001, η2p=0.761), but not during overground walking (p=0.163, η2p=0.087). Post hoc
testing of treadmill walking revealed that the slower (i.e., 85%) metronome frequencies yielded
significantly larger step lengths (0.61±0.13 m; p<0.001; Cohen’s d: 1.72), whereas the faster
(i.e., 115%) frequencies induced smaller step lengths (0.49±0.10 m; p<0.001; Cohen’s d: 1.30)
compared to treadmill walking without a metronome (0.55±0.12 m). In particular, stepping to the
85% metronome frequency induced a 10% longer step length compared to treadmill walking
without auditory cues (Control).

Cadence
There was a significant interaction between walking environment and metronome
frequency for cadence accuracy (p=0.014, η2p=0.224). Post-hoc evaluation revealed that
participants were less accurate on the treadmill at slower (85%) tempos compared to overground
(p=0.006; Cohen’s d: 0.67). Participants exhibited only small cadence errors for the 100% and
115% conditions while walking on both the treadmill and overground (p>0.256).

Cadence accuracy influenced the resulting cadence (Figure 3), as we observed an overall
higher cadence on the treadmill compared to walking overground (p=0.026, η2p=0.223).
Consistent with the cadence accuracy, post-hoc testing revealed that this difference in walking
cadence was primarily due to the 85% condition, in which higher cadence during treadmill
walking was observed compared to overground walking (p=0.006; Cohen’s d: 0.67), whereas all
other frequencies yielded comparable cadences between walking environments (all p>0.256).
Participants demonstrated their ability to modulate cadence (p<0.001, η2p=0.896), by slowing
their cadence in the 85% condition (p<0.001; η2p=0.904) and increasing their cadence in the
115% condition (p<0.001; η2p=0.856) compared to Control walking.

Discussion:
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of metronome cue frequency on
spatiotemporal gait parameters when walking overground and walking on a treadmill for
individuals with PD. We had hypothesized that step length would be differentially affected by
metronome frequency based on the walking environment. Indeed, we observed that step lengths
were longer when walking with slow tempo cues on the treadmill only, whereas step length was
not altered during overground walking. Instead, the induced change in cadence during
overground walking resulted in different walking speeds without the expected alterations in step
length. These results have important implications for the clinical use of rhythmic auditory cueing
for individuals with PD.

These data confirm that people with PD have the ability to alter their gait immediately in
response to metronome cues, but extends this finding to both overground and treadmill

environments, with a particular emphasis on the specific alterations associated with different
cueing frequencies. Our results likely arise from a mix of biomechanical and neuroanatomic
mechanisms. In particular, the ability to accept external regulation of rhythmic timing by people
with PD appears critical.15 Importantly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
have demonstrated diminished activation in many locomotor areas of the brain in people with
PD.27 This altered activation, in part, impairs the ability to independently modify gait mechanics
through internal regulation.28 Use of external cues, such as the metronome and treadmill used
here, places less demand on internal regulation of gait timing. Since the motor circuits for
synchronization remain intact for people with PD, the use of a treadmill and rhythmic auditory
cues should improve gait mechanics in ways the person would not be able to change and
maintain independently.12, 20, 21, 29

Walking speed arises directly from spatial (e.g., step length) and temporal (e.g., cadence)
measures.23, 30 As such, when gait speed is fixed, as on a treadmill, and cadence is manipulated,
the step length must change. The same is not true for overground walking, where gait speed is
free to fluctuate. Indeed, we observed predictable changes to step length on the treadmill with
altered cadence, but the step lengths remained unaltered during overground walking, despite
substantial alterations to cadence. These findings suggest that stepping to a reduced cadence
tempo should reliably increase step lengths during treadmill walking. This approach runs counter
to conventional approaches to rhythmic auditory cueing, which promote the use of faster
cadences during overground walking.15, 20 Importantly, we did not provide our participants with
any particular instruction related to altering their step length, but rather told them to simply “step
with the beat”. We can speculate that if we had instructed participants to increase their step

length during overground gait, that we would have seen that alteration as well. Clearly, however,
the ability to modulate gait speed plays a critical role in the spatial response to cue-induced
stepping.

It appears that the ability to match the cue successfully is not required to benefit from the
auditory cue. Participants in this study were able to match their stepping cadence with the 100%
and 115% metronome cues both overground and on the treadmill, but exhibited larger errors with
the 85% metronome cue (particularly during treadmill walking). Despite the errors associated
with attempting to match the 85% cues, we still observed large changes in spatiotemporal gait
parameters while walking on the treadmill. Thus, even when participants did not match the cue
accurately, the desired gait change was still observed.

We can use these results to guide treatment selection based on specific goals. In
particular, treatment goals for individuals with PD are typically aimed at addressing common
gait abnormalities, such as decreased gait speed, decreased step length, and increased cadence.12,
28, 29

Based on the results from our study, an immediate increase in gait speed can be realized by

walking overground with the 115% metronome cue. If the treatment goal is to increase step
length, we propose that walking on a treadmill with 85% metronome cues can produce a larger
step length immediately. Finally, cadence is directly manipulated both on the treadmill and
overground with a corresponding change to the cueing frequency. Given the specificity of the
various cueing frequencies and their impact on both overground and treadmill walking, we
propose a novel pairing of cue frequencies to elicit immediate changes to all relevant parameters.
In particular, treadmill walking with slow metronome cues will elicit large step lengths. We

propose that immediately following this “priming” stepping practice with overground walking
using fast metronome cues will allow for faster walking with long step lengths. Future work is
needed to determine if this novel pairing will result in substantial changes to spatiotemporal gait
parameters for individuals with PD.

Study Limitations
There were several limitations to this study. First, some participants walked slower on
the treadmill compared to overground (N=3). As a result, the step lengths appeared somewhat
shorter during treadmill walking compared to overground walking in our cohort. Furthermore,
the procedure for computing step length was different for the treadmill and overground gait. In
short, the step length from the treadmill gait likely underestimates the true step length due to
trailing limb heel rise prior to leading limb heel strike. Although our procedure allows for valid
within-environment comparisons, our between-environment comparisons should be interpreted
with caution. Additionally, some participants used the handrails on the treadmill and some did
not. This is likely because handrails provide support for improved balance and mobility.10 In
healthy adults, there is no difference in step length between holding or not holding handrails on a
treadmill.31 Most untrained people, especially those with PD, require handrails to perform
treadmill walking safely and many studies do not report whether handrails were used. Although
gait variability was not one of the outcomes assessed in this study, there is potential for
differences in gait mechanics depending on use of handrails. There was also potential for fatiguerelated changes in gait since rest breaks were only provided if requested, or unless heart rate or
gait quality indicated the need for one. Lower extremity fatigue in PD can affect gait parameters,
including step length and gait speed.32 Finally, we tested slightly more people with H&Y stage 2

and 3 than stage 1, suggesting that our results may be more heavily influenced by more advanced
PD.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we observed a significant relationship between the frequency of
metronome cues and walking environment for gait mechanics in people with PD. The gait
change that is desired (i.e. gait speed, step length, or cadence) appears to directly influences the
type of cue and environment that will be needed to achieve that particular goal. People with PD
are able to change their gait speed, step length, and cadence successfully in response to various
cue frequencies during both overground and treadmill walking; however, further exploration is
needed to determine if these results can be used as a gait training technique that carries over to
long-term gait changes.

Figure Captions
Figure 1: Gait speed (m/s) during overground gait demonstrated dramatic alterations with the
85% and 115% metronome conditions compared to the no cue (Control) condition. The
horizontal dashed line represents the no cue condition for easier visualization of relevant
comparisons. The treadmill speed did not change between conditions and is indicated on the left
for reference. Error bars indicate standard deviation.

Figure 2: Step length (m) during treadmill gait (black) and overground gait (blue/gray). Despite
no difference between conditions during overground gait, we observed significant changes
during treadmill walking. Of note, the 85% condition elicited longer steps, whereas the 115%
condition produced shorter steps compared to the no cue condition. The horizontal dashed line
represents the respective no cue conditions for easier visualization of relevant comparisons. Error
bars indicate standard deviation.

Figure 3: Cadence (steps/min) was influenced by the walking environment (treadmill: black;
overground: blue/gray), due to the inability to match intended cadence on the treadmill during
the 85% condition. Slower metronome cues reduced cadence overall, whereas faster metronome
cues generated higher cadence. Examining the difference between the intended cadence and
treadmill/overground values indicates the cadence accuracy. Error bars indicate standard
deviation.
