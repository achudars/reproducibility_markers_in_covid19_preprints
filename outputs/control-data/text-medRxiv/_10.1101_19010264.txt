Abstract
While clinical data provides physicians with information about patient

49

prognosis, genomic data can further improve these predictions. We analyzed

50

sequencing data from over 10,000 cancer patients and identified hundreds of

51

prognostic germline variants using multivariate Cox regression models. These

52

variants provide information about patient outcomes beyond clinical information

53

currently in use and may augment clinical decisions based on expected tumor

54

aggressiveness. Molecularly, at least twelve of the germline variants are likely

55

associated with patient outcome through perturbation of protein structure and at

56

least five through association with gene expression differences. About half of

57

these germline variants are in previously reported tumor suppressors or

58

oncogenes, with the other half pointing to loci of previously unstudied genes in

59

the literature that should be further investigated for roles in cancers. Our results

60

suggest that germline variation contributes to tumor progression across most

61

cancers and contains patient outcome information not captured by clinical

62

factors.

Introduction
Large-scale sequencing projects1 increased our molecular understanding

66

of cancers2 to the point where using sequencing data to augment clinical

67

decisions seems promising. Somatic mutations in cancers have received

68

substantial attention in oncology2 as they can be used to individualize drug

69

selection.3 While much effort has been directed towards characterizing somatic

70

mutations in cancer, recent studies suggest that germline variants also have

71

significant clinical utility.

72

In line with the heritability of some cancers,4 several germline variants

73

predict a patient’s risk for developing cancer and are useful for individualizing

74

cancer screening guidelines.5-13 Germline variation can affect drug sensitivity,14-20

75

predict drug toxicity, and could help select therapy to minimize side-effects.21-26

76

Some germline variants increase patient risk for specific somatic aberrations,

77

suggesting that germline variation may impact disease course.27

78

We hypothesized that the effects of germline variants on cancer

79

progression may be strong enough to identify associations with patient outcome.

80

Previous studies tested for an association between patient outcome and a small

81

number of germline variants in genes well-characterized in a given cancer.28,29

82

We published an unbiased method of testing for an association between a large

83

number of germline variants and patient outcome in patients with lower grade

84

gliomas.30 In this study, we identify prognostic germline variants using

85

sequencing data from 10,582 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

86

These germline variants significantly improve predictions of patient outcome

compared to clinical variables alone, identify biological mechanisms by which

germline variants affect patient outcomes, and identify genes and pathways that

Results

91

Identification of High Quality Germline Variants

92

Germline variants were called and filtered as shown in eFigure 1 using

93

sequencing data from 10,582 TCGA patients with 33 different types of cancers.

94

In total, 77.6 million unique variants were called. After filtering, we limited our

95

analysis to 519,319 unique variants (eFigure 2). Because the final variant call set

96

was created by merging variant calls from whole exome sequenced (WXS)

97

normal tissue samples, WXS tumor samples, and RNA sequenced tumor

98

samples, we evaluated our variant calls for contamination by somatic mutations

99

or RNA editing. Our final germline variant call set did not substantially overlap

100

with somatic mutations or RNA editing sites (eFigures 3-4, eText 1).

101

Determination of Prognostic Clinical Models for Each Cancer

102

To identify prognostic germline variants that provide additional outcome

103

information not already captured by clinical variables, we created clinical models

104

predictive of patient outcome for each cancer using the clinical information

105

previously collected by the TCGA research network along with calculated race.

106

The variables selected for each cancer are summarized in eTable 1. The study

107

was powered to capture prognostic germline variants with moderate to high effect

108

sizes (beginning at hazard ratios > 2) (eFigure 5, eText 2).

The 191 prognostic variants from the six analyses are described in eTable

110
111
112

2A-F.
The first three analyses identified germline variants associated with

113

prognosis in (1) individual cancers, (2) multiple cancers giving roughly equal

114

weight to each cancer, and (3) cancers grouped by organ system, histological, or

115

molecular classifications (Figure 1A). Analysis 1 tested 519,139 variants for

116

associations with patient outcome in individual cancers and identified 70 unique

117

prognostic variants (Figure 1B, eTable 2A, Kaplan Meier plots of selected

118

examples in Figure 2).

119

While analysis 2 identified hundreds of variants recurrently predictive of

120

outcome in >4 cancers, we will only discuss the 5 variants that were predictive in

121

seven or more cancers (Figure 1C, eTable 2B). Both the direction of the hazard

122

ratios (deleterious or protective) and the magnitude of the effect on patient

123

outcome for germline variants across different cancers were highly correlated

124

(eText 3).

125

Analysis 3 increased our statistical power by grouping similar cancer types

126

to increase the number of patients with the minor allele that could be included in

127

the study. 29 different patient groups were created based on organ system,

128

histological, or molecular classification (Figure 1D, group justification in eTable

129

3). 258,466 unique germline variants were tested and 103 prognostic variants

130

were identified (Figure 1E, eTable 2C, Kaplan Meier plots of selected examples

131

in eFigure 6).

133

Analyses 4-6 repeated analyses 1-3 but limited these analyses to variants

134

within the top 0.3% of deleterious mutants across the human genome with

135

CADD>25 (Figure 3A). Analysis 4 tested a total of 981 unique variants and

136

identified nine unique prognostic variants (Figure 3B, eTable 2D). Of the 16

137

variants that were recurrently predictive of patient outcomes in 4 or more cancers

138

(analysis 5), we will discuss the one variant that was predictive in five cancers

139

(Figure 3C, eTable 2E). Analysis 6 tested 903 unique variants for an association

140

with outcome in the patient groups used in analysis 3 and described in Figure 1D

141

and identified 3 additional prognostic variants (Figure 3D, eTable 2F).

142

The Pan-Cancer Landscape of Prognostic Germline Variants

143

The large number of prognostic variants identified in analysis 1 and 3

144

allowed us to compare the characteristics of these germline variants with

145

previously reported characteristics of variants identified by genome wide

146

association studies (GWAS). Three characteristics have been noted in variants

147

identified through GWAS: (1) the minor allele tends to be deleterious when

148

considering the set of variants with large effect sizes, (2) there is a negative

149

correlation between effect size and allele frequency, and (3) most germline

150

variants identified by GWAS do not cause amino acid changes.31

151

To test whether the deleterious allele is usually the minor allele, the

152

predictive alternate alleles from analysis 1 were classified as deleterious (HR>1)

153

or protective (HR<1) based on the Cox regression results. Of the prognostic

154

germline variants from analysis 1, the deleterious allele is clearly often the minor

155

allele (p=7.077E-8) (Figure 4A). A similar analysis with the predictive variants

156

from analysis 3 (Figure 4B) did not show a significant statistical depletion of

157

deleterious alternate alleles from the population (p=0.115). The predictive

158

variants from analysis 3 were detectable only with larger sample sizes and have

159

smaller effect sizes than those identified by analysis 1. Thus the result in Figure

160

4B is still consistent with the first premise31 that a deleterious allele with a large

161

effect size (as in analysis 1, but not analysis 3) is usually the minor allele.

162

A negative correlation is seen between effect size and allele frequency

163

with both variants from analysis 1 (Spearman’s rho = -0.282, p=0.0184) and

164

analysis 3 (Spearman’s rho = -0.667, p<2.2E-16), satisfying the second premise.

165

Finally, the vast majority of predictive variants identified by this GWAS do not

166

cause amino acid changes (Figure 4C-D), satisfying the third premise.

167

A previous study had identified germline variants associated with an

168

increased incidence of somatic mutations in cancer related genes.27 We also find

169

that somatic mutations are increased in driver genes in the relevant cancer with

170

prognostic versus non-prognostic variants (OR=1.89, p=0.0001, eText 4).

171

Germline Variants Significantly Improve Outcome Prediction Models

172

The effect sizes of prognostic germline variants from analysis 1 were large

173

enough to hypothesize that germline variants identified in individual cancers

174

could improve clinical outcome models in current use.

175

The clinical variables predictive of outcome (eTable 1) were used to

176

generate the first outcome model (Clinical: C). The second outcome model was

177

based on clinical information plus the status of a particular predictive germline

178

variant (Germline Variant: GV) (C+GV). An example receiver operator

characteristic (ROC) curve for predicting LAML patient vital status at 366 days of

180

follow-up is shown using C and C+GV for predictive variant rs3003628 (ROC in

181

Figure 4E). The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for the C model is 0.807 and

182

for the C+GV model is 0.928. The change in AUC (DAUC) for the C+GV model

183

relative to the C model in this example is 0.12 (12%). To ensure that the change

184

in AUC is consistent at different times of follow-up, DAUC was calculated from

185

the 10th to the 90th percentile of patient outcome time. The mean and standard

186

error of DAUC was plotted against the p-value of the one-sided test evaluating

187

whether the AUC for C+GV is significantly larger than the AUC for C (Figure 4F).

188

This analysis was repeated for all predictive variants. There is a

189

consistent, statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in AUC when the clinical

190

model is enhanced by germline variant information (C+GV) compared to the

191

clinical model alone (C) for 63 of the predictive germline variants out of 70 tested

192

(eTable 4). These results demonstrate that adding predictive germline variants to

193

existing clinical criteria will improve the prediction of outcome of many cancers.

Prognostic Variants in Driver Genes, Oncogenes, and Tumor Suppressor

195

Genes

196

90 of the 193 genes in the proximity of one of the prognostic germline

197

variants have been functionally implicated in nine of the twelve hallmarks of

198

cancer (Figure 5A, eTable 5).32

199

Roughly 50% of the predictive variants are found in or near genes that

200

possibly have tumor suppressor or oncogenic activity (Figure 5B, eTable 5).

201

About 25% of the predictive genes were previously studied in the cancer in which

202

the germline variant was found to be prognostic, about half were previously

203

studied in at least one cancer, and roughly two-thirds were studied in at least one

204

human disease (Figure 5C, eTable 5). Prognostic variants were identified in or

205

near MSH6, POLQ, ARID5B, and IDH2, which are previously reported cancer-

206

driver genes (Figure 5D).

207

Prognostic Germline Variants Can Cause Significant Amino Acid Changes

208

or Act as eQTLs
The 12 prognostic variants identified in analyses 4-6 caused significant

209
210

amino acid changes (CADD>25), with many of these amino acid changes

211

occurring in protein-coding domains with annotated or known functions (Figure

212

5E).

213

39 variants could act as cis eQTLs, as they were associated with

214

expression differences of the proximate genes. We highlight 5 of these variants

215

because the expression levels of the proximate genes are also predictive of

216

survival, with the direction of the effect (HR >1 or <1) being concordant with the

217

effect of the variant (Figure 5F). Of these 5 variants, 3 were also cis eQTLs in

218

the corresponding tissue in GTEx.33

219

Prognostic Variants Implicated in Other Diseases

220

Some of the prognostic variants are linked with diseases that occur in the

221

tissue giving rise to the tumor, suggesting the variant has an important function in

222

that tissue (Figure 5G, eTable 6A). eTable 6B lists prognostic genes that are

223

linked in the literature to traits in tissues outside the ones bearing the tumors.

Individual Prognostic Variant Characterization

10
225

In this section, we characterize three germline variants to illustrate how

226

individual germline variants may be associated with patient outcome.

227

rs1800932 in MSH6 May Be Associated with Favorable Outcome by

228

Increasing Temozolomide Sensitivity

229

rs1800932 predicts favorable patient outcome in gliomas (LGG and GBM).

230

This variant is an eQTL for increased expression of MSH6 in many tissues,

231

including nerve,33 is associated with increased expression of MSH6 in patients

232

with LGG (p=0.00732), and has previously been reported to be associated with a

233

decreased risk of prostate cancer.34 We found MSH6 expression to be correlated

234

with elevated temozolomide sensitivity in cancer cell lines (Spearman’s

235

rho=0.165, p=5.01E-7).35 Temozolomide is a DNA alkylating agent used in the

236

treatment of most glioma patients and is likely to have been used in the therapy

237

of the most patients with gliomas in TCGA. MSH6 knockdown increases

238

temozolomide resistance36 and somatic mutations in MSH6 are associated with

239

temozolomide resistance in gliomas.37 Taken together, this suggests that

240

rs1800932 is an eQTL for increased expression of MSH6 in gliomas, which may

241

increase sensitivity to temozolomide, the primary chemotherapeutic agent for

242

gliomas.

243

rs55796947 in MAP2K3 May Result in Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis

244

rs55796947 in MAP2K3/MKK3 predicts favorable prognosis in KIRC. This

245

germline variant introduces a stop codon in MAP2K3 that truncates the kinase

246

domain. MAP2K3 inhibition results in cell cycle arrest, autophagy-mediated cell

247

death, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and sensitization to chemotherapy

248

drugs.38 Indeed, tumors in patients with this variant upregulate genes involved

249

with apoptosis (p<0.001, Figure 6A-B) and downregulate E2F targets involved in

250

cell-cycle progression (p=0.047, Figure 6C). This germline variant likely

251

truncates the kinase domain of MAP2K3, resulting in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,

252

and favorable patient outcome.

253

rs77903511 is an eQTL for BIRC5 which Inhibits Apoptosis

254

rs77903511 predicts poor patient outcome in UVM (Figure 6D). BIRC5

255

inhibits apoptosis through interaction with and inhibition of caspase 9 and effector

256

caspases. The alternate allele is associated with increased BIRC5 expression in

257

the tumors (p=0.02, Figure 6E). Consistent with a role of BIRC5 in apoptosis

258

inhibition, BIRC5 expression is associated with poor patient outcome (Figure

259

6F). This variant, therefore, may be associated with poor outcome because of an

260

increase of the apoptosis inhibitor BIRC5.

261

Discussion

262

This study shows, as a general principle, that germline variants are

263

associated with cancer patient outcome. The prognostic germline variants

264

enhanced patient outcome predictions compared to models based on currently

265

collected clinical data. We envision germline variants providing clinicians with

266

information about a patient as a supplement to reported history, physical exam

267

findings, and imaging and laboratory tests. These predictions will improve over

268

time with the use of more information available in electronic medical records.

269

While we identified a large number of prognostic germline variants in analysis 1,

270

the power calculations and the identification of additional prognostic germline

12
271

variants by grouping similar cancers suggests that more prognostic germline

272

variants will emerge as more tumors are sequenced.

273

Further study is necessary to validate the associations that we identified,

274

as setting the discovery threshold at FDR<0.10 suggests that some of the

275

associations may have occurred by random chance. The variants identified in

276

analyses 2 and 5 require deeper interrogation, as we were unable to develop an

277

unbiased test to assess the probability of those associations occurring by random

278

chance. While we identified germline variants associated with significant

279

improvements in clinical outcome predictions, further work is necessary to

280

identify situations in which the additional prognostic information would be

281

valuable for treatment decisions or end of life planning.

282

It is reassuring that a significant fraction of prognostic germline variants

283

are found in or near possible tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, or known

284

cancer driver genes. The variants in cancer driver genes, MSH6, POLQ,

285

ARID5B, and IDH2, warrant further study to determine the mechanism by which

286

these variant affect cancer progression.39 The twelve germline variants in Figure

287

5E that cause substantial amino acid changes are prime candidates for

288

experimental follow-up and are discussed in detail in eText 5. A handful of the

289

prognostic germline variants have been associated with human disease, some in

290

the same tissue and others in unrelated tissues, suggesting that these

291

pathologies may stem from shared molecular phenomena (eTable 6).

292
293

The mechanisms of action of many of the prognostic variants are currently
unknown. There are many possibilities by which the variants that do not cause

13
294

amino acid changes could affect cancer biology.40 Many variants are likely acting

295

as trans eQTLs, which are difficult to study in datasets with relatively small

296

sample sizes. The already high involvement of tumor suppressor genes,

297

oncogenes, and driver genes among the prognostic germline variants is

298

promising for future study. This report provides basic science researchers with

299

genes and variants that should be studied to better understand the etiology and

300

progression of cancers, while providing clinicians with the potential for better

301

clinical predictions that could be made if germline variants are considered in the

302

context of patient care.

B. Analysis 1. Germline variants found to be predictive of patient outcome in

500

each cancer. Each dot represents a germline variant that was tested for an

501

association with patient outcome. Variants closer to the outside of the plot are

502

more closely associated with patient outcome. Variants in red are significantly

503

(FDR<0.10) associated with patient outcome. The alternating black and grey

504

colors reflect alternating chromosomes for the germline variants that were not

505

significant predictors of patient outcome.

506

C. Analysis 2. Germline variants found to be recurrently predictive of patient

507

outcome in multiple different cancers. We identified 5 total germline variants that

508

were recurrently predictive (p<0.05) of favorable (HR<1) or deleterious (HR>1)

509

patient outcomes in 7 or more different cancers.

550

line represents patient outcome predictions made using clinical information in

551

addition to rs3003628 germline variant status (C+GV model), which we found to

552

be predictive of patient outcomes in LAML. The Area Under the Curve (AUC)

553

was 0.81 for the C model and 0.93 for the C+GV model giving a DAUC of 0.12

554

(12%).

555

F. Many of the prognostic germline variants improve clinical outcome model

556

predictions. For each prognostic variant, we created a ROC curve based on the

557

clinical (C) model and the clinical + germline variant (C+GV model), as in Figure

558

5E, at each point in time from the 10th- 90th percentile of patient progression or

559

death for each cancer. The DAUC of the C+GV model versus the C model at

560

each time point was calculated (eTable 4). X-axis: Mean and standard error of

Figure 5. Literature review of genes associated with the prognostic germline

567

variants and mechanisms by which prognostic germline variants may exert their

568

effects.

569

A. The cancer-related functions of genes associated with the prognostic germline

570

variants are quite diverse.

571

B. Many of the genes associated with the variants have previously been reported

572

to be tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. We categorized genes as tumor

573

suppressor genes or oncogenes based on phenotypes reported in the literature,

574

even if the exact mechanism through which the genes act have not yet been

575

determined.

576

C. Although many of the variants have been studied in the field, there are many

577

genes that have not yet been studied in the context of human disease and

578

therefore may warrant investigation by the field.

579

D. Four of the genes associated with prognostic germline variants are in

580

previously reported cancer driver genes.

581

E. Some of the prognostic germline variants cause dramatic amino acid changes

Online Methods

606

Data Sources, Variant Calling, and Quality Control

607

We determined the germline variant status of 10,582 cancer patients by

608

variant calling the patients’ whole exome sequenced normal samples (WXS

609

normal), whole exome sequenced tumor samples, (WXS tumor) and RNA

610

sequenced tumor samples (RNA tumor) available on Cancer Genomics Cloud41

611

using VarDict (mapping quality > 30, base quality > 25, variant reads > 2,

612

minimum allele frequency > 5%, no duplicate reads)42 and determined the

613

sequencing depth at each position using samtools (mapping quality > 30).43 We

614

set variant calls to unknown if the position at which the variant was called was

615

covered by fewer than 10 reads. We then merged these three variant call sets,

616

giving preference to WXS normal then WXS tumor then RNA tumor. We only

617

included variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% in the non-Finnish

618

European population of gnomAD,44 variants found in more than 14 patients in a

619

given cancer, and variants whose calls were greater than 90% concordant with

620

each other in a given cancer in our final analysis. These thresholds had been

621

selected in our previous study in order to better tune the allele frequencies of the

622

European patients in our study to previously reported population frequencies.30

623

We labeled variant calls as concordant for a given variant if they gave the exact

624

same variant call (homozygous for the reference allele, heterozygous, or

625

homozygous for the alternate allele) in the WXS normal, WXS tumor, and RNA

626

tumor samples. Variant calls were therefore discordant if the variant call differed

627

in any of the three samples. The percentage concordance was calculated for

25
628

each germline by dividing the total number of concordant variant calls by the total

629

number of patients and multiplying the result by 100%.

630

We retrieved clinical outcomes data for each patient using the TCGA Pan-

631

Cancer clinical data resource.45 We used TCGAbiolinks to obtain patient clinical

632

information46 and we downloaded patient race composition from The Cancer

633

Genome Ancestry Atlas (TCGAA).47 Additional clinical information for the lower

634

grade glioma and glioblastoma patients was downloaded from a previous

635

analysis.48 We used Lasso-regularization to determine which clinical covariates

636

should be controlled for in our models, while using patient race composition from

637

TCGAA in place of patient-reported race.49,50 We were not able to control for

638

treatment. As discussed in greater detail by Liu et al., it is very difficult to control

639

for treatment in the TCGA dataset.45 Detailed treatment information was not

640

submitted in a consistent manner for many of the patients in TCGA and absence

641

of submitted treatment information does not necessarily mean that the patient did

642

not receive treatment. Furthermore, treatment regimens are quite complex and

643

depend on chemotherapy drug selection and dosage, extent of surgical excision,

644

and radiation therapy, among other factors. The broad spectrum of treatment

645

options makes treatment challenging to control for. As discussed by Liu et al., the

646

TCGA treatment information will likely need to be evaluated by panels of cancer

647

specialists before it can be used for modeling in pan-cancer studies.45

648

We determined the number of somatic mutations in the cancer samples

649

and evaluated the overlap between germline variants and somatic mutations and

650

RNA editing sites as previously described.30 To ensure that our variant calls from

26
651

the four variant call sets (WXS normal, WXS tumor, RNA tumor, and Combined)

652

were concordant with each other, we calculated the allele frequency of each

653

variant as in our previous analysis and calculated the Spearman correlation

654

coefficient of these allele frequencies with each other.

655

Power Analysis

656

We performed a power analysis in individual cancers to evaluate our

657

ability to detect associations between germline variants and patient outcome

658

using Cox regression. The power to detect an association between a germline

659

variant and patient outcome is dependent on the sample size, effect size,

660

correlation with other covariates in the model, the number of individuals with the

661

germline variants, and the number of individuals without a germline variant,

662

among other factors. As a result, the power to detect an association differs

663

between germline variants, even assuming the same hazard ratio. To estimate

664

our power, we therefore randomly sampled 10,000 germline for each cancer from

665

the pool of germline variants to be tested in that cancer. We calculated statistical

666

power using the powerSurvEpi R package (https://cran.r-

667

project.org/web/packages/powerSurvEpi/index.html). We calculated our power to

668

detect a significant association at a significance level (α) of:

669

0.10
Total Number of Germline Variants Tested in That Cancer

670

This threshold would be as stringent or slightly more stringent than false

671

discovery correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure which we

672

ultimately used in our analysis. We then calculated the percentage of germline

27
673

variants for which we had greater than 80% statistical power to detect a

674

significant association at hazard ratios of 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 20.

675

Identification of Prognostic Germline Variants

676

We utilized six total approaches for identifying prognostic germline

677

variants. In all analyses, we tested variants for an association with outcome using

678

a Cox regression model, controlling for the covariates that we identified

679

previously for each cancer using Lasso-regularization. We used the R packages

680

survminer (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/index.html) and

681

survival (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) to perform

682

Cox regression and generate Kaplan-Meier plots. p-values were corrected for

683

multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The circos

684

plots were generated using the R package circlize.51

685

In analysis 1, we tested variants for an association with patient outcome in

686

individual cancers, setting an adjusted p-value threshold (FDR) less than 0.10.

687

We reported all statistically significant results and did not filter our results based

688

on a hazard ratio threshold, as it is difficult to know what hazard ratio threshold

689

would be clinically and biologically relevant. In the second analysis, we filtered

690

our results from analysis one to identify germline variants that were recurrently

691

associated (p<0.05) with favorable (hazard ratio (HR)<1) or poor (HR>1)

692

outcome relative to the reference allele in seven or more cancers, such that the

693

most recurrent prognostic variants would be reported. Given that molecular

694

similarities between some of the TCGA cancers may have made it more likely

695

that certain germline variants would be picked up in this second analysis than

28
696

others, we did not think that it would be statistically valid to estimate the

697

probability of variants being pulled out by this analysis by chance. In the third

698

analysis, we grouped the cancers based on clinical understanding about the

699

cancers and clustering patterns observed previously by the TCGA research

700

network.52 We tested germline variants for associations with patient outcome

701

(FDR<0.10) in these larger groups to detect germline variants with smaller effect

702

sizes. In pooling cancers, we implicitly assumed that the germline variant had

703

similar effects in the grouped cancers. If this assumption was not true for a

704

particular germline variant, then that germline variant would actually be less likely

705

to be associated with patient outcome. Only variants found in 15 or more patients

706

across all grouped cancers were tested, resulting in fewer variants being tested

707

in this analysis.

708

Analyses 4-6 were quite similar to analyses one through three, except that

709

we restricted our analysis to only germline variants that caused significant amino

710

acid changes with a combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) score

711

greater than 25.53 This enabled us to identify associations that we did not capture

712

in analyses one through three due to the relatively higher stringency in that

713

analysis resulting from multiple hypothesis correction. In analysis four, we tested

714

variants with CADD score > 25 in individual cancers for an association with

715

patient outcome (FDR<0.10). In analysis five, we filtered the results from analysis

716

four to identify germline variants with CADD score > 25 that were recurrently

717

associated (p<0.05) with favorable (HR<1) or poor (HR>1) prognosis in 5 or more

718

patients. In analysis six, we tested germline variants with CADD > 25 for a

719

significant association (FDR<0.10) with patient outcome in the previously

720

described patient groups.

721

The Cox regression models that we fit for individual cancers controlled for

722

the covariates that we found to be prognostic in those cancers (eTable 1). The

723

Cox regression models that we fit for patient groups controlled for the covariates

724

that we found to be prognostic in individual cancers with each term containing an

725

interaction term associating that variable with the cancer that it was associated

726

with patient outcome in. We also controlled for cancer type in these combined

727

groups. As an example, suppose that variable A is associated with patient

728

outcome in cancer X and variable B is associated with patient outcome in cancer

729

Y. Then we would fit two Cox regression models to identify prognostic germline

730

variants in individual cancers and a third Cox regression model to identify

731

germline variants prognostic in the pooled cohort, as illustrated below.

739

740

In model (3) above, cancer X status is a dummy variable that can be 0 or 1. The

741

value of this variable is 0 for patients with cancer Y and 1 for patients with cancer

742

X. The opposite is true for the cancer Y status variable. This allowed us to group

743

patients to test for an association with patient outcome, while controlling for

744

differences between different cancers and relevant clinical differences between

745

patients with the same cancer.

746

Concordance and Correlation of Hazard Ratios for the Prognostic Germline

747

Variants

748

We tested whether germline variants associated with patient outcome

749

(p<0.05) in three of more cancers were typically recurrently deleterious or

750

protective more often than would be expected by random chance and if the

751

hazard ratios estimated for these prognostic germline variants in different

752

cancers were correlated with each other.

753

To test for concordance, we first counted the number of times that

754

germline variant was found to be associated (p<0.05) with poor patient outcome

755

(HR<1) or favorable patient outcome (HR>1). We then calculated the following

756

value for each prognostic germline variant:

757

max(𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒, 𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒)
𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 + 𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒

758

where poor outcome is the number of times that the germline variant was

759

associated with poor outcome (HR<1) and favorable outcome is the number of

760

times that the germline variant was associated with favorable outcome (HR>1). If

31
761

a germline variant was perfectly concordant, then the calculated value would be

762

1. While theoretically the expected value would be 0.5 for a random germline

763

variant, we empirically estimated the expected value by the following calculation:

764

max(𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒)
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑟 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 + 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒

765

In this set of prognostic variants, there were more variants associated with poor

766

patient outcome (HR<1) than favorable patient outcome (HR>1), resulting in the

767

expected index being 0.589. We then used a Wilcoxon rank sum test to

768

determine whether the concordance values that we calculated from the set of

769

prognostic germline variants differed from what we would expect by random

770

chance.

771

We next tested whether the hazard ratios estimated for a given prognostic

772

germline variant in different cancers were correlated with each other. Because

773

we had previously found the hazard ratios to be concordant, we performed this

774

analysis separately for instances in which a germline variant was found to be

775

deleterious and protective. We identified the set of variants associated with

776

favorable (HR<1) outcome and deleterious (HR>1) outcome in three or more

777

cancers. The set of variants that were associated with favorable and deleterious

778

outcome were analyzed separately. For each analysis, we generated all possible

779

pairs of hazard ratios for a given germline variant. We then ran a Spearman’s

780

correlation test to determine whether or not the hazard ratios were correlated to

781

each other. Because the hazard ratio is also correlated to the allele frequency,

782

we repeated the prior analysis with a Spearman partial correlation test to control

for germline variant allele frequency. Partial correlation was calculated used the

784

ppcor R package.54

785

Characteristics of Prognostic Germline Variants

786

Having identified the prognostic germline variants, we then aimed to

787

compare the characteristics of prognostic germline variants to the characteristics

788

of germline variants identified in previous genome wide association studies.31 We

789

decided to use the variants from analysis one and analysis three to understand

790

the characteristics of prognostic germline variants because the other approaches

791

each identified a very small number of prognostic germline variants. We decided

792

not to pool all of the germline variants together due to possible differences in

793

characteristics between these sets of variants. We therefore analyzed the

794

characteristics of the prognostic germline variants from analysis one and from

795

analysis three separately. To avoid considering the same information multiple

796

times, we removed variants that were linked with each other from the analyses in

797

this section and only retained the first variant by genomic position. The actual

798

variant retained did not have a significant effect on our results because the

799

hazard ratios and sample sizes for the linked variants were very similar.

800

We first tested whether or not the minor allele was typically associated

801

with poor patient outcomes. We sorted the variants into two categories: minor

802

alleles that were deleterious in the Cox regression model (HR>1) and minor

803

alleles that were associated with favorable outcomes (HR<1). Although the

804

reference allele was often the major allele, this was not always the case. We

805

performed a one-sided Fisher’s exact test in R to determine whether or not the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19010264; this version posted October 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

33
806

minor allele was more likely to be deleterious. The R package scatterpie

807

(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scatterpie/index.html) was used to

808

display the proportion of homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous

809

alternate individuals in Figures 4A-B. For variants in analysis three that were

810

pulled out in multiple groups, we displayed the proportion of individuals only for

811

the group that contained the largest number of individuals. The largest group

812

always contained all individuals because the smaller groups were made up of

813

smaller number of cancers and was always contained in the larger group. For

814

example, suppose a variant was found to be prognostic in both group 20 (KICH,

815

KIRP) and group 19 (KICH, KIRC, KIRP). In this case, we would perform all

816

calculations using the information from group 19.

817

We next tested whether or not there was an inverse correlation between

818

effect size and allele frequency. To do this, we calculated the Spearman

819

correlation coefficient between effect size, calculated as |ln(HR) − 0|, and allele

820

frequency. Finally, we identified the genomic regions (upstream of a gene, 5’

821

UTR, exonic, intronic, 3’ UTR, downstream of a gene, or intergenic) in which

822

each variant was located in using annovar.55 Some variants were found in

823

multiple different transcripts and therefore mapped to several different genic

824

regions. For the purposes of creating Figures 4C-D, we allowed a single variant

825

to count once for multiple different regions. Excluding these variants from

826

Figures 4C-D did not change our interpretation of the results.

Association of Prognostic Germline Variants with Somatic Driver Mutations

34
828

We tested whether the prognostic germline variants were more likely to be

829

associated with somatic mutations in driver genes than would be expected by

830

random chance. We retrieved the set of driver genes for each cancer and

831

consensus somatic mutation calls for each cancer from TCGA Network

832

analyses.2,56 For each cancer, we only considered driver genes with five or more

833

patients with a somatic mutation in that driver gene in that cancer. For each

834

prognostic germline variant, we tested whether the deleterious variant was

835

associated with an increased incidence of somatic mutations in each of the driver

836

genes being considered for that cancer in patients with the deleterious allele

837

compared to patients with the protective allele using a one-sided Fisher’s exact

838

test. p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

839

We were then able to determine the number of germline variants that were

840

associated with a somatic mutation in a driver gene. We repeated this approach

841

for all germline variants included in this analysis and performed a one-sided

842

Fisher’s exact test to determine whether or not more prognostic germline variants

843

than expected were associated with a somatic mutation in a driver gene.

844

Area Under the Curve

845

To assess the clinical relevance of our findings, we tested whether the

846

germline variants enhanced patient outcome predictions made using clinical

847

information alone. While we had identified germline variants associated with

848

outcome controlling for clinical covariates, we aimed to determine whether these

849

variants significantly improved patient outcome predictions beyond predictions

850

made using the clinical model alone, particularly in cancers in which the

35
851

prediction by the clinical model was already quite accurate. We generated

852

receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves from the tenth percentile of patient

853

death or patient progression to the ninetieth percentile of patient death or patient

854

progression for each variant in R (https://cran.r-

855

project.org/web/packages/survivalROC/survivalROC.pdf, https://cran.r-

856

project.org/web/packages/timeROC/timeROC.pdf). We generated two ROC

857

curves per variant: (1) the first was made using only patient clinical information

858

(C) and (2) the second was generated using both patient clinical information and

859

germline variant status (C+GV). We ran a one-sided Wilcoxon-rank sum test in R

860

to determine whether the model supplemented with germline variant status

861

consistently yielded better predictions across time for each variant. While our

862

Cox regression analysis identified variants that were significantly associated with

863

patient outcome, these variants may not necessarily substantially improve clinical

864

outcome predictions in cancers in which the clinical variables are already very

865

good at predicting outcome. Running the one-sided Wilcoxon-rank sum test

866

allowed us to test whether the improvement to the prediction was significant.

867

Gene Annotation and Literature Review

868

We annotated the variants resulting from our analysis using biomaRt.57,58

869

We reviewed the literature for the functions of these genes to understand their

870

functions. Many of the authors (RP, SK, ZS, SS, BW, TT, JA, KL, TP, ES, MK)

871

initially reviewed the literature for information about each gene. The literature

872

review was then verified by three of the authors (RP, SK, ZS) to ensure

Having generated a list of genes that the germline variants are associated

875

with from biomaRt, we first specifically searched the literature to see if these

876

genes had a function in cancer that had been characterized and that fit a

877

category described by Weinberg and Hanahan.32 This part of the literature review

878

had the largest number of unknowns due to the large amount of specificity

879

required by the studies. We then relaxed our stringency and checked to see

880

whether or not the gene was associated with findings in the literature consistent

881

with oncogenic or tumor suppressor activity in the context of cancer. Finally, to

882

understand in general whether or not these genes are being actively studied by

883

the field, we categorized these genes based on whether or not the literature

884

suggested that the genes are being studied in a cancer in which the germline

885

variant was found to be prognostic, studied in any cancer, or studied in any

886

human disease. We also overlapped our gene list with the list of driver genes

887

generated by the TCGA research network.2

Variant Mechanisms and Literature Review

889

We next aimed to understand the mechanisms by which the prognostic

890

germline variants may be exerting their effects. We started with the germline

891

variants that were predicted to cause significant amino acid changes (CADD>25).

892

We determined the position and amino acid change caused by these germline

893

variants using Ensembl.59 We determined the domain in which these germline

894

variants cause their amino acid changes using the National Center for

895

Biotechnology Information databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the

896

Ensembl and Uniprot60 databases. We next identified germline variants that are

897

likely acting as expression quantitative trait loci in cis (cis eQTLs). For each

898

germline variant, we separated patients based on whether or not they had at

899

least one non-reference allele and then determined whether or not there was a

900

statistically significant difference between the mean expression of the gene

901

associated with the variant between the two groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum

902

test. We then combined our prediction as to whether the germline variant was

903

protective or deleterious with the expression difference between the two groups

904

to determine whether increased expression of the gene would be expected to be

905

protective or deleterious. We fit Cox regression models using the expression of

906

each of the genes, controlling for clinical covariates, and compared the result to

907

our prediction. We reported variants that are concordant with our predictions.

908

Because the differential expression and Cox regression results had to both be

909

concordant with each other, we used a more relaxed cut-off of p < 0.10 for

910

hypothesis generation. Further studies with larger cohorts and more statistically

911

power are necessary to further interrogate these associations. Finally, we

912

checked to see whether the eQTL was also reported in GTEx in the tissue from

913

which the tumor was derived by downloading the list of tissue-specific and pan-

914

tissue eQTLs and comparing the eQTLs identified in our analysis to those

915

reported in GTEx.

916

We reviewed the literature for previous associations tied to these variants

917

reported in the literature. As was the case with gene annotation, the literature

918

review was first done by multiple authors (RP, SK, ZS, SS, BW, TT, JA, KL, TP,

ES, MK) with the final round of quality control and verification being done by a

920

single author (BW).

921

Correlation with Drug Sensitivity

922

We found the germline variant rs1800932 in MSH6 to be associated with

923

favorable patient outcome and increased MSH6 expression. Because a previous

924

analysis found that MSH6 knockdown resulted in increased temozolomide

925

resistance,36 we tested whether MSH6 expression was correlated with

926

temozolomide sensitivity in cancer cell lines. To do this, we downloaded MSH6

927

expression levels and temozolomide sensitivity for 915 cell lines using data from

928

the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database61 through CellMinerCDB.35

929

We tested for an association using Spearman’s correlation test.

930

Pathway Dysregulation

931

For selected prognostic germline variants described in the text, we tested

932

whether or not these prognostic germline variants were associated with

933

upregulation or downregulation of genes in specific pathways. For each

934

prognostic germline variant, we separated patients into two groups based on

935

whether or not the variant allele was called in those patients. We calculated the

936

log fold change of each gene expressed greater than a median of 1 fragment per

937

kilobase per million mapped reads and used these values as an input for gene

938

set enrichment analysis.62
