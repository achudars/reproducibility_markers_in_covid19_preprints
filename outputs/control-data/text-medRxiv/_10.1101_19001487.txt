Measurements and Results: A total of 54 patients were treated from August 2016 to November 2018;
30 received ETM only, 22 received supplemental cooling, and 2 had treatment discontinued prior to
reaching target due to recovery. Target temperatures ranged from 32 to 36 degrees. The median time
to target temperature for the entire cohort was 219 minutes (IQR 81-415). For the cohorts without, and
with, supplemental cooling modalities, the median time to attain target temperature was 128 minutes
(IQR 71-334), and 285 minutes (IQR 204-660), respectively. Survival to ICU discharge was 51.9% for the
entire cohort.
Conclusions: ETM attains target temperature at a rate consistent with current guidelines and with
similar performance to alternative modalities. This may provide a more cost-effective and approachable
core cooling option to community hospitals that only use water blankets or other surface methods.

INTRODUCTION
Targeted temperature management (TTM) is a long-standing standard of care for post-cardiac arrest
patients.[1] However, consistently implementing a TTM protocol is challenging, especially in a
community hospital. Often, the protocols described in the literature include labor- and cost-intensive
methods, that are not feasible or sustainable in highly resource-constrained healthcare settings. For
example, the intravascular cooling methods often outperform surface methods in terms of time to
target temperature.[2-8] However, because intravascular cooling is physician initiated and introduces
risks including catheter associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and
pulmonary embolism (PE) [9-13], it may not be an ideal choice for some organizations. Surface devices
can be deployed by a wider range of clinicians, such as nurses, and avoid CLABSI and reduce the risks of
DVT and PE, but increase the incidence of shivering, which in turn impact temperature maintenance and
adds to the overall cost of care.[14, 15]
Esophageal temperature management (ETM), a relatively new TTM method, offers minimally invasive
core access. ETM uses a device that is placed in the esophagus, in a similar fashion to an orogastric
tube. The device connects to external water blanket heat exchanger, which provides cold or warm water
in a closed circuit, thereby transferring heat across the patient’s core. This approach avoids the risks of
sterile intravascular placement and the challenges of transferring heat across the skin. Since our facility
already owned compatible heat exchangers and these heat exchangers can be used simultaneously with
our current stock of water blankets, the Value Analysis Committee found ETM to be a cost-effective
option and approved implementation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate ETM performance, used
alone or combined with surface methods, in a cohort of patients who received TTM after cardiac arrest.

This was an IRB-approved (PHIRB 1085850-3) retrospective study of all patients treated with an ETM
device (EnsoETM ECD02A, Attune Medical, Chicago, IL) for TTM after cardiac arrest in a single
institution. All patients had attained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest from
any rhythm, and were cooled according to local hospital protocol, using a Cincinnati Sub-Zero Blanketrol
III Hyper-Hypothermia System connected to the ETM device. Additional surface wraps were added in
patients at the discretion of the treating clinicians.
Data collection
Charts were identified through a quality-control log of patients treated with temperature management.
Details of treatment, including device used, temperature targeted, and time to target temperature were
extracted by one study author (RF) and reviewed in cases of uncertainty by the remaining authors.
Patient starting temperature, target temperature, and times of start and attainment of goal
temperature were collected.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data are reported with descriptive statistics, utilizing parametric or non-parametric measures where
appropriate.
RESULTS
A total of 54 patients were treated with ETM over the evaluation period from August 2016 to November
2018. Of these 54 patients, 30 had ETM only, 22 had supplemental, and 2 recovered and had treatment
discontinued prior to reaching target. Target temperatures ranged from 32°C to 36°C, depending on
clinician preference, with a range typically specified spanning 2-3 degrees (for example, 34-36°C, or
33°C-35°C).
The median time to attain target temperature for the entire cohort was 219 minutes (IQR 81-415).
Patients treated with ETM only had a median time to target of 128 minutes (IQR 71-334) and patients
who received with supplemental surface cooling had a median time to target temperature of 285

minutes (IQR 204-660). Survival to ICU discharge was 51.9% for the entire cohort, and survivors
exhibited longer times to achieve goal temperature (median 180 minutes in non-survivors vs. 255
minutes in survivors).
DISCUSSION
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the largest study to date characterizing time to target using ETM after
cardiac arrest. The aim of the study was to determine cooling rate in a large cohort of patients treated
at a single institution. Although the study was not designed to make a direct comparison between
esophageal cooling and other modalities, the data suggest that the cooling rate is comparable to other
methods. A review of independent published data on alternative cooling methods used in post-cardiac
arrest TTM shows median times to target temperature ranging from 130 minutes to well over 600
minutes (Table I).
Some patients arrived at lower core temperatures than others, allowing them to reach target more
quickly, while others took much longer to cool and required supplemental cooling via head wraps, chest
wraps, blankets, or ice packs to achieve target temperature. While this retrospective study cannot
identify the specific reasons that clinicians utilized additional cooling modalities for particular patients,
our study found that survivors exhibited longer times to achieve goal temperature, a finding similar to
other reports in which a quicker time to target temperature is associated with worse outcome.[18-21]
In a study of 203 patients, non-survivors generated less heat than survivors and reached target
temperature sooner (median, 2.2 hr [interquartile range, 1.5–3.8 hr] vs median, 3.6 hr [interquartile
range, 2.0–5.0 hr]; p = 0.01).[18] A study of 177 patients found that median time to target temperature
was shorter among non-survivors (200 [IQR 25–363] min) than survivors (270 [IQR 158–375] min, p =
0.03).[21] A study of 321 patients found that time to target temperature in the “good outcome” (CPC 1–
2) cohort was 237 (IQR142–361) minutes compared to 180 (IQR 100–276) minutes in the “poor
outcome” (CPC 3–5) cohort (p = 0.004).[20] A study of 588 patients found that time to target

temperature was 209 minutes (IQR 130-302) in patients with favorable neurological outcomes
compared to 158 min (IQR 101-230) (P < 0.01) in patients with unfavorable neurological outcomes.[22]
The hypothesis for these differences has been that those who cool more quickly have lost the ability to
thermoregulate, which may represent more severe brain injury, and thus, worse outcomes, in this
subset of patients.[18]
LIMITATIONS
This study is limited by its retrospective nature; however, we utilized endpoints recorded in the medical
record that are generally reliable and unlikely to be systematically biased. Although an inverse
association was found between survival and cooling rate, no causation can be attributed.
CONCLUSION
ETM attains target temperature with similar performance to alternative modalities, offering core patient
cooling without the risks of intravascular placement. As in other studies, surviving patients required
longer times to reach target temperature.
