ABSTRACT
Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome, strongly associated with disability, mortality and
hospitalisation. The mechanisms underlying frailty are multifactorial and not well
understood, but a genetic basis has been suggested with heritability estimates between 19 and
45%. Understanding the genetic determinants and biological mechanisms underpinning
frailty may help to delay or even prevent frailty. We performed a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) of a frailty index (FI) in European descent participants from UK Biobank
(n=164,610, aged 60-70 years). FI calculation was based on 49 self-reported items on
symptoms, disabilities and diagnosed diseases. We identified 26 independent genetic signals
at 24 loci associated with the FI (p<5*10-8). Many of these loci have previously been
associated with traits such as body mass index, cardiovascular disease, smoking, HLA
proteins, depression and neuroticism; however, three appear to be novel. The estimated single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability of the FI was 14% (0.14, SE 0.006). A genetic
risk score for the FI, derived solely from the UK Biobank data, was significantly associated
with FI in the Swedish TwinGene study (n=10,616, beta: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.20, p=0.015).
In pathway analysis, genes associated with synapse function were significantly enriched
(p<3*10-6). We also used Mendelian randomization to identify modifiable traits and
exposures that may affect the risk of frailty, with a higher educational attainment genetic risk
score being associated with a lower risk of frailty. Risk of frailty is influenced by many
genetic factors, including well-known disease risk factors and mental health, with particular
emphasis on synapse maintenance pathways.

INTRODUCTION
Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome involving multi-system impairment which is
associated with increased vulnerability to stressors (Dodds & Sayer 2016). Frailty is a major
public health issue in geriatric populations and is becoming increasingly common with aging
demography (Morley 2016). Prevalence is estimated as 17.4% worldwide in communitydwelling older adults aged 60 and above (Siriwardhana et al. 2018). Many frailty definitions
exist but two of the most commonly used are the frailty phenotype (FP) (Fried et al. 2001)
and the frailty index (FI) (Mitnitski et al. 2001). The FP is a clinical syndrome based on the
presence of three of five physical components (exhaustion, weakness, slow walking speed,
unintentional weight loss and low physical activity), whereas the FI is based on the
accumulation of a number of health deficits during the life course. While both measures are
related to adverse aging outcomes, the FI is better at discriminating at the lower to middle
end of the frailty continuum, making it better suited for measuring frailty in seniors at
younger age (Blodgett et al. 2015).
Frailty is associated with many negative health outcomes including disability, mobility
limitations, a variety of chronic diseases and hospitalisation, and it is a strong predictor of
mortality (Vermeiren et al. 2016) (Kojima et al. 2018) (Chang & Lin 2015). The mechanisms
underlying frailty are likely multifactorial but not well understood. Studies have suggested a
genetic basis, with heritability estimates between 19 and 45% (Livshits, Lochlainn, et al.
2018) (Murabito et al. 2012) (Young et al. 2016). Candidate gene association studies for
frailty have suggested the involvement of genes in inflammatory pathways (Viña et al. 2016),
including tumour necrosis factor (Mekli et al. 2016) and interleukin-18 (Mekli et al. 2015).
Large-scale GWAS are needed to better understand the genetic determinants of frailty and
associated biological pathways. These might provide insights for interventions to prevent and
delay frailty and hence promote healthier and more independent aging.
We undertook a GWAS of frailty, measured using the FI, in 60 to 70 year old participants of
European descent from the UK Biobank cohort, with replication in the Swedish TwinGene
cohort study. To gain insights into the functional relevance of emergent genetic associations,
we examined the relationship of the frailty risk loci with circulating proteins and tissuespecific gene expression and epigenetic profiles. We also leveraged the GWAS findings in
Mendelian randomization analyses to identify modifiable physiological, lifestyle or
environmental traits that could be targeted by clinical and/or public health interventions to
mitigate frailty risk.

RESULTS
Study characteristics
In this GWAS, we included 164,610 UK Biobank participants of European descent aged 60
to 70 years at baseline (mean 64.1, SD 2.8), which included 84,819 females (51.3%). The FI
score ranged from zero to 27, from 49 deficits in total, and the mean proportion of deficits

was 0.129 (SD 0.075), with a slightly higher mean score in females (0.132, SD 0.076)
compared to males (0.125, SD 0.074).
The TwinGene participants (n=10,616) – whose data were used in replication testing of
GWAS findings from UK Biobank – were Swedish nationals aged 41 to 87 years (mean 58.3,
SD 7.9) with 5,577 females (52.5%), and all of European descent. The TwinGene FI score
ranged from zero to 26.25 deficits (44 considered in total), and the mean proportion of
deficits was 0.121 (SD 0.080). The Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA)
participants (n=368) – whose data were used in DNA methylation-related follow-up analyses
– were all of European descent, aged 48 to 93 years (mean 68.6, SD 9.6), with 223 (60.6%)
females. The SATSA FI score ranged from zero to 19 deficits (42 considered in total), and
the mean proportion of deficits was 0.100 (SD 0.087).
GWAS of the FI
We identified 26 independent signals associated (p<5*10-8) with the FI (n= 5,849 associated
variants in total), at 24 loci (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Eleven variants were associated at
significance levels substantially below a multiple testing-corrected p-value threshold of 3*109
(0.05 corrected for 16.4 million autosomal variants included in the analysis), although this is
likely to be too conservative given the correlated nature of genetic variants. The Lambda GC
(genomic control) value was high (1.37; see Supplementary Figure 1 for QQ plot), however
the intercept from Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSR) analysis was 1.02 (SE
0.009), indicating that the inflation in test statistics is mainly due to polygenicity (many
variants with small effects on frailty), and the bias potentially due to population stratification
is minimal (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based
heritability (h2g) of the FI was estimated to be 0.14 (SE 0.006), i.e. 14%, by LDSR. Full
GWAS summary statistics are available to download
(https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9204998).
Many of the top 24 loci have previously been associated with traits and diseases in the
GWAS Catalog (Buniello et al. 2019) (as of 20th June 2019) such as body mass index (BMI),
cardiovascular disease, smoking initiation, HLA proteins, depression, and neuroticism (Table
1, Supplementary Table 1), but nine of the associations appear to be novel. Six of the nine
novel loci appear to be less reliable – single variants associated with the FI, with no other
correlated variants at the loci showing appreciable evidence of association. Three of the nine
novel loci appear more robust and reliable. These are intronic variants in the protein-coding
genes CSMD3 (rs28453001), ANK3 (rs4146140) and TMOD3 (single nucleotide deletion on
chromosome 15 position 52168661).
Candidate Gene Association Analysis
Based on prior evidence we also specifically looked up two variants for which we
hypothesised an association with the FI a priori. Specifically, rs429358, one of the two
APOE e4 variants – related to both cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases – was not
associated with the FI (p=0.29). The 9p21.3 variant rs2891168 (associated with parents’
survival in a previous GWAS (RHJ Timmers et al. 2019), but also with heart disease and

related traits) in the lncRNA ANRIL – also known as CDKN2B-AS1 - showed evidence of
association, although did not reach genome-wide significance (p=3*10-5).
GWAS Replication in TwinGene
We sought replication in 10,616 participants in the TwinGene study. Of the 26 signals from
our discovery GWAS, 16 were directly genotyped or imputed in TwinGene, and an additional
five had suitable proxy SNPs to use as substitutes (listed in Supplementary Table 2). Two
were associated with the FI with consistent directions of estimates: rs759661 and rs7218235
(proxy for rs7219015). However, as power to detect the individual variant associations was
limited, we also calculated a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) of the available 21 variants
and tested its association with the FI. The GRS was significantly associated with the FI score
(β 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.20, p = 0.015).

Pathways Enrichment Analysis Implicates Synapse Activity
With gene-set enrichment analysis using MAGMA software, we found four pathways
significantly enriched in the GWAS results for FI after adjustment for multiple testing
(Bonferroni): “post synapse”, “excitatory synapse”, “synapse”, and “synapse part” (p<3*10-6;
see Supplementary Table 3 for details). In stratified Linkage Disequilibrium Score
Regression (LDSR) analysis (Finucane et al. 2018), which identifies whether GWAS
statistics are associated with specific gene-tissue pairings in expression or chromatin
modification, we found enrichment for the genetic determinants of frailty in several brain
regions, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5
for details).
GWAS hits as molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
We examined whether there are established associations of the top 26 SNPs with
concentrations of circulating proteins, gene expression and/or epigenetic markers, as reported
by previous QTL GWAS with genome-wide significance (p<5*10-8). In total, four SNPs are
established protein QTLs (Supplementary Table 6). Two cis-acting intronic SNPs were
associated only with proteins encoded by the genes in which the variants are located (NCAM1
and HLA-DQA1). Two other SNPs – in HLA-DQB1 and near RBM6 – were associated in cisor trans- with four and five proteins, respectively. 15 of the SNPs were found to be
expression QTLs, associated with mRNA varying from one to 14 genes, in up to 43 tissues
types (Supplementary Table 7). The most widespread associations with expression were
present for rs3764416, which resides in sequence for a non-coding RNA with unknown
function on chromosome 17 (LOC10192709). In epigenetic marker data (Supplementary
Table 8), 16 SNPs were identified as methylation QTLs in one or more blood cell types, with
CpG associations per SNP ranging from one to 73. Additionally, four of these SNPs are
associated with histone modifications in blood cells, including rs3764416. Variant rs3764416
may also be associated with splicing variation of a nearby pseudogene, SUZ12P.

Methylation - FI associations
Of the total 5,849 variants associated with the FI in UK Biobank, 3,943 were cis-methylation
quantitative trait loci (cis-mQTL) identified in SATSA. These 3,943 variants had 26,851
demonstrable associations with CpG sites in total; single variants were commonly associated
with multiple CpG sites, and there were 128 unique CpGs among all associations. Associated
variants for the 128 CpGs are shown in Supplementary Table 9. Methylation level in one
(cg20614157) of the 128 CpG sites was significantly associated with the SATSA FI after
Bonferroni-correction (see Table 2; full results for all 128 sites shown in Supplementary
Table 10) and 8 CpG sites were associated with a nominal p<0.05
Mendelian Randomization (MR)
To identify potentially modifiable phenotypic traits that may contribute to the development of
frailty over the life course, we conducted a series of MR analyses. First, we calculated genetic
risk scores (GRS) for 35 traits for which we could retrieve one or more SNPs robustly
associated with the traits from pre-existing GWAS results (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table
11). We then tested the association of each GRS with the FI. Using two-sample MR methods,
we further examined the top 8 results from GRS analyses that passed Bonferroni correction
for 35 tests (p<0.0014): educational attainment, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory bowel
disease, grip strength, parental attained age (as a proxy for inherited propensity for
longevity), age at menarche and the age at first sexual intercourse (a proxy for a combination
of personality characteristics and related health behaviours).
As trend lines in Figure 3 indicate, educational attainment was estimated to be a determinant
of frailty by all model types: on average, a standard deviation increase (i.e. an additional 3.7
years) in education was predicted to lead to 13.6% lower frailty by the seventh decade of life
in UK Biobank participants. There was no evidence to suggest that these results were
influenced disproportionately by outlying variants, nor biased by directional pleiotropy (MREgger intercept test p =0.43), although the test for this may have had limited power. Higher
BMI was associated with a higher risk of frailty, and later age of menarche was associated
with a lower risk of frailty, although with more modest and inconclusive estimates from MREgger and robust/penalised models (see Supplementary Figures 2-8 for scatter plots and full
MR results for the non-education phenotypes tests). Model types also produced inconclusive
or more divergent findings for grip strength, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory bowel disease,
parental attained age and age at first sexual intercourse, at least partly reflecting the use of
less informative sets of genetic instruments for analyses of several of these traits.

DISCUSSION
In this GWAS, we identified 26 independent genetic variants at 24 loci associated with frailty
(as measured by the FI) in 164,610 UK community-based individuals aged 60 to 70 years of
European ancestry. Many of these loci have previously been associated with traits such as
body mass index, cardiovascular disease, smoking initiation, HLA proteins, depression and
neuroticism, suggesting roles for known disease risk factors and mental health in the

development of frailty, with particular emphasis on synapse maintenance seen in pathways
analysis.
Our SNP-based heritability estimate of 14% for the FI was slightly lower than previous
family- or twin-based estimates between 19 and 45% (Livshits, Lochlainn, et al. 2018)
(Murabito et al. 2012) (Young et al. 2016). This is expected as this SNP-based estimate does
not include rare, structural, non-additive, or non-autosomal genetic influences.
Of the 24 loci associated with frailty in this study, most are also associated with traits that
have widespread health consequences, such as BMI, smoking initiation, depression, or
neuroticism. The results include three independent variants in the major histocompatibility
complex region of chromosome six, containing many HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen)
genes. HLAs are cell-surface proteins crucial for regulating immune function, which is
known to decline with age (Simon et al. 2015). Genetic variants affecting the efficiency of
immune function at older ages could have profound consequences for morbidity: variants in
this region are robustly implicated in many chronic diseases and traits (Buniello et al. 2019),
and also weakness in older people (sarcopenia) (Jones et al. 2019).
In our analysis of blood-based DNA methylation associated with the FI, the only confirmed
mQTL CpG (cg20614157) association was in a promotor for the TNXB/TNXA/STK19
[Tenascin XB/putative Tenascin XA/Serine/threonine-protein kinase 19] gene cluster, located
in the HLA region. The association of a marker of potential functional relevance with the FI
increases the likelihood that one or more of the genes in this cluster are of causal relevance
for frailty risk, rather than others in the wider region. We found that high methylation level in
cg20614157 was associated with higher frailty; a previous study has found that high
methylation of the CpG site is associated with low expression of TNXB in breast and skin
cancer tissues (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard 2016) . TNXB is an extracellular matrix
protein thought to be involved in wound healing and collagen function. Further research is
needed to examine the potential role of the methylation and expression of TNXB, or other
genes in this region, with frailty.
To our knowledge, three of the 26 FI-associated variants have not previously been reported in
GWAS of any other traits, all in or near genes linked to neuronal function. CSMD3 (CUB and
Sushi multiple domains 3) is expressed in the brain and appears to regulate dendrite
development (Mizukami et al. 2016). ANK3 (Ankyrin 3) is a scaffold protein involved in
neurotransmission with links to bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease (Hori et al. 2014)
(Franceschi et al. 2018). The final novel locus is TMOD3 (Tropomodulin 3) which was
recently linked to cognitive function (Davies et al. 2018). TMOD3 modulates actin stability,
and therefore affects actin binding and remodelling, with diverse downstream effects
including cell migration, exocytosis, erythropoiesis, and other developmental pathways
(Parreno & Fowler 2018). These results are consistent with FI-defined frailty having a
neurological basis, as has been suggested by a previous study showing that frailty and chronic
widespread pain have shared neurological pathways (Livshits, Malkin, et al. 2018). Pain
questionnaire responses constituted a notable proportion of the FI items in UKB (9 of 49;
18.4%), which will have influenced these findings. However, the relationship of these genetic

risk loci with frailty was also present in the replication sample, which included fewer items
related to pain perception (2 of 44; 4.5%).
Surprisingly, loci implicated in longevity (RHJ Timmers et al. 2019) or key aging hallmarks
(Pilling et al. 2016) were not associated with the FI at genome-wide significance. This
included genetic variants in APOE, 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/B), TERT, and FOXO3A. The FI is
strongly associated with morbidity and mortality epidemiologically, but it may be limited as a
tool for identifying specific aging pathways, given the broad definition that includes many
diverse diseases and characteristics.
In Mendelian randomization analyses, we tested whether long-term effects of specific
physiological, behavioural or lifestyle factors may affect FI scores. The most prominent
findings indicated that predispositions to higher educational attainment and lower BMI were
related to decreased frailty. Higher BMI directly affects cardiovascular health and subsequent
disease risk, in addition to possible indirect effects by reducing socioeconomic status due to
stigma (especially in women) (Tyrrell et al. 2016), with subsequent effects on frailty. This
also supports a recent study which provided evidence against the notion of an obesity paradox
in older people (Bowman et al. 2017).
To our knowledge, this is the largest genetic study of frailty to date. However, this study is
limited to participants of European ancestry so results may not be generalizable to other
populations. UK Biobank volunteers tend to be healthier and less socioeconomically deprived
at baseline than the general UK population (Fry et al. 2017), perhaps reducing power to
detect variants associated with the FI. The FI was also based on self-reported baseline data so
is open to the possibility of misclassification bias, but the FI has previously been validated in
UK Biobank and shown to be strongly predictive of all-cause mortality (Williams et al.
2019). Samples sizes in TwinGene and SATSA are also relatively small so power for the
replication and CpG-FI analyses may have been limited.
In conclusion, frailty is influenced by a large number of genetic determinants linked to wellknown disease risk factors such as BMI, cardiovascular disease, smoking and HLA proteins.
Frailty is also influenced by genetic determinants for depression and neuroticism, suggesting
a role for mental health, which may be underpinned by pathways involving synapse
maintenance. Future research is required to replicate our results in other cohorts, testing for
consistency of genetic determinants when frailty has been measured differently. In particular,
a comparable GWAS of the frailty phenotype, based on physical components of health (e.g.
exhaustion, weakness) rather than comorbidities, would be likely to yield further risk loci
specifically for these components of frailty.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
UK Biobank
UK Biobank recruited 502,642 community volunteers, aged 37 to 73 years old, from 22
assessment centres across England, Scotland and Wales between 2006 and 2010 (Sudlow et
al. 2015). At baseline, participants provided self-reported information on demographics,

lifestyle and disease history via questionnaire and underwent physiological measurements,
including providing a blood sample for genetics data. We included participants aged 60 to 70
years old at baseline of European descent, with genetics data (n=201,062) and available data
to generate the frailty index (n=164,610) (see Frailty Index section below for details). UK
Biobank has ethical approval from the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee.
TwinGene
TwinGene data collection took place between 2004 and 2008, when the older participants of
the Screening Across the Lifespan Twin (SALT) study were invited to donate blood for
molecular and genetic analyses. Both same and opposite-sex twins were included.
Ascertainment procedures for SALT (Lichtenstein et al. 2002) and TwinGene (Magnusson et
al. 2013) have been previously described. This study was based on the sample that had both
genetic and FI data available (n=10,616). All participants have given their informed consent.
The TwinGene study was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board, Stockholm.
Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA)
SATSA is a longitudinal study in gerontological genetics, with sampling of participants
drawn from the Swedish Twin Registry. SATSA was initiated in 1984 and ended in 2014,
and it comprises of nine questionnaire and ten in-person testing (IPT) waves. The participants
are same-sex twins, of which some twin pairs have been reared together and some separated
before age 11 and reared apart. Ascertainment procedures for SATSA have been described
previously (Finkel & Pedersen 2004). This study made use of IPT data, and participants’ first
available measurement on FI and DNA methylation were included (n =368). All participants
have provided informed consent. The SATSA study was approved by the Regional Ethics
Review Board in Stockholm.
Frailty Index (FI)
We used a Frailty Index based on the accumulation of deficits model (Searle et al. 2008), as
validated in UK Biobank previously for its ability to predict all-cause mortality (Williams et
al. 2019). The FI was derived using 49 self-reported baseline data variables in UK Biobank.
Variables were based on a variety of physiological and mental health domains, and included
symptoms, disabilities and diagnosed diseases, which were self-reported by participants at
baseline (see Supplementary Table 12 for details of the FI components included and the
proportion of individuals scoring one for each component). The FI was generated using a
complete-case sample with information on all 49 individual components (n=164,610) and
presented as a proportion of the sum of all deficits. The FI was quantile normalised (i.e.
transformed into a normal distribution) prior to the genome-wide association study (due to
the skew of the untransformed trait) and sensitivity analyses using the non-transformed trait
were performed.
Construction of the FIs for TwinGene and SATSA have been previously described and
validated for their ability to predict mortality (Li et al. 2019) (Jiang et al. 2017). Briefly, both
the TwinGene FI and SATSA FI were constructed using self-reported questionnaire data (for
TwinGene the data collected in SALT were used) and they cover a variety of different health

domains. The TwinGene/SALT FI consists of 44 deficits and the SATSA FI consists of 42
deficits. Prior to the analyses, the FIs were quantile-normalised.

GWAS of the Frailty Index
We used data from UK Biobank v3 genotyping release, described in detail previously
(Bycroft et al. 2018). In brief, 488,377 participants were successfully genotyped using custom
Affymetrix microarrays for ~820,000 variants. Imputation was performed using 1000
Genomes and the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) reference panels, yielding ~93
million variants in 487,442 participants. Participants were excluded if the UK Biobank team
flagged them as either having unusually high heterozygosity or missing genotype calls
(n=968) (Bycroft et al. 2018). Our analysis was restricted to those of European descent
(n=451,367, method previously published (Thompson et al. 2019)), aged 60 to 70 with
complete FI data (n=164,610). We analysed 16,446,667 autosomal variants with minor allele
frequency (MAF) >0.1%, Hardy-Weinberg p-value >1x10-9, and imputation quality >0.3.
BOLT-LMM (v2.3.2) software used for the GWAS itself (Loh et al. 2015), which uses linear
mixed-effects modelling to account for genetic relatedness and confounding by ancestry.
Models included age, sex, assessment centre (22 categories), and genotyping array (two
categories: Axiom or BiLEVE) as covariates. We performed conditional analysis to identify
independent signals at the same locus using GCTA-COJO (v 1.91.1) (Yang et al. 2012), using
a randomly selected subset of 20,000 unrelated UK Biobank participants of European descent
as the reference sample. We used Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSR, v1.0.0)
to estimate the level of bias (e.g. from population stratification and cryptic heritability) in the
GWAS, and the heritability of the Frailty Index (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015).
GWAS Replication in TwinGene
The GWAS for the frailty index was replicated in the TwinGene cohort (see Supplementary
Methods for details).
Gene Ontology Pathways & QTL analyses
See Supplementary Methods for details.

Mendelian Randomization (MR)
MR is the application of genetic variation to infer whether phenotypic traits or exposures
affect diseases or health-related outcomes (Lawlor et al. 2008). We investigated a range of
exposures for which genetic determinants (typically SNPs) have been identified in previous
GWAS. In total, 35 exposure-frailty associations were modelled. Exposures included lifestyle
factors, clinical measures, circulating biomarkers and diseases. All traits are listed in
Supplementary Table 11, with references for the GWAS from which sets of instrumenting
variants were sourced. We used genetic risk scores (GRS) for each trait in initial MR models,
and followed up several of the lead findings with sensitivity analyses to detect and account
for bias by pleiotropy among genetic instruments (described in the Supplementary Methods).

Methylation – FI association analysis
To identify examine whether risk variants could be related to frailty via DNA methylation
differences, we assessed whether the FI-associated genetic variants harboured methylation
quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and whether methylation levels in such loci demonstrated
further associations with the FI in SATSA (see Supplementary Methods for further details).

Known signal from GWAS Catalog: either the lead SNP or a variant in high LD (R2>0.8) is associated with the trait. ~ indicates a variant in moderate LD (R2>0.4 and <0.8) is associated with the
indicated trait. **Novel and reliable. *Novel, but appear to be less reliable (e.g., a single variant is associated with FI, with no other correlated variants in the locus). See Supplementary Table 1 for full
mapping to GWAS Catalog downloaded 20 June 2019 (with complete references).

Figure 1. Manhattan plot for genome wide association study of Frailty Index in UK Biobank

GWAS of Frailty Index (normalized) in 164,610 UK Biobank participants aged 60-70 of European descent.
Analysis included 16.446.667 autosomal variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.1%. Hardy-Weinberg
p-value >1x10-9 and imputation quality >0.3. Linear mixed-effects regression models (BOLT-LMM
software(Loh et al. 2015). which accounts for relatedness and population structure) were adjusted for age, sex,
assessment centre (22 categories) and genotyping array (2 categories: Axiom or BiLEVE). There are 26
independent signals at 24 loci (highlighted in blue) associated with p<5*10-8 (red line).

Figure 2. Genetic risk score associations with the frailty index in UK Biobank

Thirty-five exposures, including lifestyle factors, clinical measures, circulating biomarkers and diseases were
assessed for their association with the Frailty Index by genetic risk score analysis in UK Biobank participants of
European descent aged 60-70 years. Linear regression models included age, sex, assessment centre (22
categories), genotyping array (2 categories: Axiom or BiLEVE) and principal components of ancestry 1-10 as
covariates. The betas represent the SD change in FI per SD increase in genetic predisposition to the exposure.
Positive betas suggest increased frailty in individuals with greater genetic predisposition to the exposure,
whereas negative betas represent a protective effect with increasing genetic predisposition. See Supplementary
Table 6 for details. *=significant p<0.0014 after Bonferroni correction for 35 tests.

Figure 3. Mendelian randomization estimates for the effect of educational attainment on the
frailty index in UK Biobank

Points and error bars represent beta estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each SNP-education / SNP-FI
association. The trend lines represent different methods for summarising the estimates from individual SNPS –
inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median and MR-Egger. The weighted median and MR-Egger
estimates are less prone to bias from pleiotropy among the set of variants than IVW, given alternative
assumptions hold. The MR-Egger method includes a test of whether the trend’s intercept differs from zero,
which indicates whether there is an overall imbalance (directional) of pleiotropic effects: such bias was not
identified in this education-FI model.
