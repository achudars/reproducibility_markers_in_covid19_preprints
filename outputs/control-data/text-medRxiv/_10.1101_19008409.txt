Abstract
Background: In Canada, hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission primarily occurs among people who inject drugs (PWID)
and people with experience in the prison system bare a disproportionate HCV burden. These overlapping groups of
individuals have been identified as a priority populations for HCV micro-elimination in Canada, a country currently not
on track to achieve its elimination targets. Considering the missed opportunities to intervene in provincial prisons, this
study aims to estimate the population-level impact of prison-based interventions and post-release risk reduction strategies
on HCV transmission among PWID in high HCV-burdened Canadian city, Montréal.
Methods: A dynamic HCV transmission model among PWID was developed and calibrated to community and prison
bio-behavioural surveys in Montréal. The, the relative impact of prison-based testing and treatment or post-release
linkage to care, alone or in combination with risk reduction strategies, was estimated from 2018 to 2030, and compared to
counterfactual status quo scenario.
Results: Testing and linkage to care interventions implemented over 2018-30 could lead to the greatest declines in
prevalence (23%; 95% Credible interval(CrI):17–31%), incidence (20%; 95%CrI: 10–28%), and prevent the most new
chronic infections (8%; 95%CrI: 4–11%). Testing and treatment in prison could decrease prevalence, incidence, and
fraction of prevented new chronic infections. Combining test and linkage to care with risk reduction measures could
further its epidemiological impact, preventing 10% (95%CrI: 5–16%) of new chronic infections. When implemented
concomitantly with community-based treatment scale-up, both prison-based interventions had synergistic effects, averting
a higher fraction of new chronic infections.
Conclusion: Offering HCV testing and post-release linkage to care in provincial prisons, where incarcerations are
frequent and sentences short, could change the course of the HCV epidemic in Montréal. Integration of post-release risk
reduction measures and community-based treatment scale-up could also increase the impact of these interventions.

1. Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is responsible for more years
of life lost than any other infectious disease and could lead
to a projected increase in the North American burden of
end-stage liver disease and liver cancer over the coming
years [1, 2]. The advent of highly efficacious and tolerable
direct-acting antivirals (DAA) propelled the World Health
Organization to set ambitious targets for HCV elimination
by 2030 [3]. Micro-elimination, which consists of tailored
interventions targeted at priority populations, was deemed
a key approach to achieve this objective [3, 4]. Currently,

Canada is not on track to attain these elimination targets, however, there is a national initiative advocating the
adoption of micro-elimination strategies for people who
inject drugs (PWID) and people in prison [5]. While the
general Canadian population has a low HCV prevalence
(0.96% in 2011), PWID and people in Québec’s provincial
prisons, who have an average stay duration of 74 days per
incarceration, experience a disproportionately high HCV
burden, with antibody prevalence of 63% (2003-2015) for
the former, and of 13% for the latter [6, 7, 8].
Provincial prisons have been identified as key settings
to implement micro-elimination strategies. However, little
efforts have been made to strengthen engagement along
the HCV care cascade for people in Canadian provincial
prisons [5, 9]. PWID have high incarceration rates in the
provincial prison system and incarceration has been la-

2. Methods

belled as a driver of the epidemic [10]. Incarceration could
sustain transmission through the elevated the risk of HCV
transmission and acquisition in the period where formerly
incarcerated PWID transition back to the community [10].
This heightened risk results from withdrawal symptoms
experienced during incarceration and the unstable postrelease environments, which can both lead to at-risk drug
use behaviours in the community [11, 12, 13, 10, 14]. Tailored interventions for prevention, screening, and treatment,
in prison or following release, could alleviate this heightened risk of onward HCV transmission [13, 9, 15]. PWID
in Canada have negative and stigmatizing lived experiences in health care, which reduces their engagement in
this system [16, 17]. Prisons represent important initial
points of contact with these services [18, 16, 17]. Nonetheless, contrary to the Canadian federal prison system, there
are no HCV-specific interventions in the country’s provincial prisons, with the exception of opt-out HCV testing in
British-Colombia [9, 19].
Considering the missed opportunities to intervene in
provincial prisons, a careful evaluation of potential interventions is necessary. One option is to allow people with
chronic HCV to initiate treatment in prison. However,
the majority of people in the provincial system serve sentences that are less than what is needed to complete a
course of DAAs, which could lead to non-adherence or
lower sustained virologic response (SVR) following release
[20, 8, 9, 21]. Even if DAAs are completed and SVR is
achieved during their stays, the heightened injecting risk
post-release could lead to re-infection [22, 10, 9]. To alleviate such risks, interventions that enhance linkage to
care with community services, such as nurse-led models
could better address the needs of releasees [18, 23, 24].
Importantly, prison-based continuum of care interventions
in provincial settings must be evaluated in the context of
a broad DAA scale-up among community PWID, as advocated by the Canadian Blueprint for HCV elimination
[5]. With the increased availability of pan-genotypic and
short course DAA regimens, measuring the contribution of
prison-based interventions to the overall micro-elimination
effort is a current priority in Canada.
To address this, the current study aims to 1) assess
whether a prison-based test-and-treat or a test and postrelease linkage to care strategy is more effective in reducing
HCV transmission, 2) quantify the added benefits of postrelease risk-reduction measures to either approach, and 3)
examine how a scale-up of DAA in the community modifies
the effectiveness of these prison-based interventions. The
population-level impact of the different scenarios will be
measured among community PWID in Montréal, a high
HCV prevalence setting in Canada. The results from this
work will inform program managers and policy makers
alike in the development of effective prison-based strategies
contributing to the overall HCV elimination effort.

2.1. Model structure
A dynamic compartmental mathematical model of HCV
transmission among PWID, adapted from Stone et al. [13],
was parametrized, and calibrated to detailed longitudinal
epidemiological data. The model is stratified by sex and
considers three distinct but overlapping dynamics: 1) HCV
transmission, 2) incarceration, and 3) injecting behaviours.
The model is deterministic in nature and individuals without prior HCV exposure enter the population at a rate
chosen to match PWID population size estimates from
2003 and 2010 [25]. Individuals either leave the model by
all-cause or, when in advanced HCV disease stages, liverrelated mortality. Active PWID and those recently released
from prison have an increased risk of death as compared to
individuals in the general population [26, 27]. A complete
description of the model structure, the force of infection,
and model equations are available in the supplementary
appendix (Text S1).
2.1.1. HCV transmission dynamics
PWID can acquire HCV and become acutely infected at
a time-dependent force of infection that varies according to
chronic prevalence, mixing patterns by incarceration history
among community PWID, injecting behaviours, and interventions (i.e., needle and syringe programs; NSP) (Figure
1). Within six months, people with acute HCV either spontaneously clear their infection or develop chronic HCV. In
the first case, people return to the HCV-susceptible stage,
having developed HCV-specific antibodies, and can be reinfected. In the second case, people develop chronic HCV
and progessive fibrosis until late HCV infection, where liverrelated mortality can occur [28, 29]. People with chronic
infection can be diagnosed at any disease stage and then
treated at a time-varying rate that depends on fibrosis stage
until 2018 (when fibrosis stage treatment restrictions were
lifted in Canada) [30]. Treatment either leads to failure
or SVR. Following SVR, people can be re-infected with
HCV at the same force of infection as for primary infection
[31, 32, 33].
2.1.2. Incarceration dynamics
People who initiate injection are assumed to have no
experience with the prison system and can be incarcerated
at a time-dependent rate (Figure 1). At the end of their
incarceration PWID are released back in the community
and experience a short six-month period characterized by
an increased risk of HCV acquisition and transmission,
as well as heightened all-cause mortality [27, 10]. After
this time, they are categorized as previously incarcerated
[34, 10]. People released from prison and people with
previous incarceration experience higher incarceration rates
than that of primary incarceration [8, 35, 13].

2.1.3. Injecting behaviours dynamics
PWID can completely stop injecting drugs, and a fraction can initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT) to account
for people in situations of opioid use disorder. On OAT,
people can continue injecting, but with a lower risk of
HCV acquisition and transmission and stop after an average active injecting duration determined from the literature [36, 37]. For simplicity, people who have completely
stopped injection drug use (IDU) cannot re-initiate that
behaviour (Figure 1).

2.2. Parametrization and calibration
2.2.1. Parametrization
Two main data sources were used to inform our model
parameters: repeated cross-sectional bio-behavioural surveys of PWID in Montréal (SurvUDI, 2003-2015) and two
large prison bio-behavioral surveys conducted in 7 of the 17
provincial prisons in Québec (in 2003 and 2014) [7, 35, 8].
Parameters that could not be estimated from these local
surveys were obtained from the relevant scientific literature.
These include HCV-related biological parameters (spontaneous clearance, fibrosis progression rates, etc.), and relative risk measures for HCV acquisition and transmission,
and death (Table 1). Where data was not available from
meta-analyses, the most robust studies to inform model parameters were used (e.g., average injecting duration; Table
1). A detailed description of the abovementioned surveys
is available in the supplementary information (Text S1).

2.2.2. Calibration
The model was calibrated to annual HCV antibody
prevalence and incidence estimates resulting from the SurvUDI
network in Montréal (2003 to 2015), and antibody prevalence among incarcerated individuals self-reporting IDU in
the past six months (in 2003 and 2014) [7, 38, 35]. Given
its flexibility, a Bayesian framework was adopted for model
calibration and appropriate prior distributions were elicited
for relevant parameters (Table 1). Latin Hypercube sampling was used to sample 120,000 parameter sets from their
prior distributions. After running the model to equilibrium
in 2003, the posterior distribution of model outcomes was
approximated with a sampling importance resampling algorithm, resulting in 1163 unique parameter sets (Text S2).
Cross-validation of model predictions was also performed
for knowledge of HCV status.
2.3. Intervention scenarios
Once calibrated to empirical data, we assessed the
population-level impact of different scenarios on chronic
HCV prevalence, incidence, the cumulative fraction of new
chronic infections prevented, and the number of chronic
infection averted per person treated over the 2018-2030
period, as compared to two couterfactual scenarios (Table
2). The first counterfactual kept testing and treatment
rates as well as intervention coverage (i.e., OAT and NSP)
at their 2018 levels. The second counterfactual scenario

Figure 1: (a)Hepatitis C (HCV) natural history and cascade of
care. The model is open, and people initiate injection as susceptible
(S(t)) at a rate θ. Upon an effective contact, they become acutely
infected (A(t)) at a time-dependent force of infection λ(t). People
spontaneously clear the infection after six months at a probability α
and become susceptible but antibody postitive (Sab+ (t)). Otherwise,
they become chronically infected (CF 0−2 (t)) and progess in fibrosis
stages until late HCV infection (CF 3−4 (t)), where they can die
of liver-related mortality µ1 . Chronically infected people can be
diagnosed (DxF 0−2 (t), DxF 3−4 (t) ) without regards to disease stage
at a rate τ and then linked to treatment (Tx(t)) at a time varying
rate that depends on fibrosis stage (σ F 0−2 (t), σ F 3−4 (t)). Treatment
either leads to failure or sustained viral response and people become
susceptibles but antibody positive. People who spontaneously cleared
or were cured of the disease are susceptible to reinfection (Aab+ ) with
HCV at the same force of infection λ(t). (b) Incarceration dynamics.
People who initiate injection have never been incarcerated (P0 (t))
and can be incarcerated at a time-dependent rate η 0 (t). They are
then released back to the community at a time-dependent rate η 1 (t)
and are considered recently released for 6 months (P2 (t)) after which
they become previously released (P3 (t)). People with experience in
the prison system can be reincarcerated at a rate η 3 (t). (c) Injection
dynamics. People who inject drugs (PWID, I0 (t)) completely stop
injecting at a rate which is defined as the inverse of the average
injecting duration (δ 0 ). They can also initiate opioid agonist therapy
(OAT) at a constant rate δ 1 . On OAT, people can continue injecting
and only stop after the average duration of injection δ 0 . Once people
have stopped they cannot go back to injecting.

corresponds to an immediate community-based DAA scaleup, where community PWID are tested once per year and
all diagnosed chronic cases systematically treated. Four
prison-based intervention scenarios were implemented. In
the first, 90% of people are tested and 75% of those diagnosed with chronic HCV are treated in prison (PB T-Tx ).

3. Results
3.1. Model calibration
The model reproduced longitudinal trends in HCV antibody prevalence and incidence estimates (2003-2014) from
SurvUDI, repeated cross-sectional surveys with information
on 6,591 community PWID in Montréal (Figure 2)[7]. The
model also replicated HCV-antibody prevalence from the
two surveys of people in prison declaring IDU in the past six
months, although the model prediction for 2014 could be
slightly overestimated (Figure 2). Posterior distributions
of model parameters can be found in the supplementary information (Table S2-1). Cross-validation of model outputs
with empirical estimates of knowledge of HCV status also
suggested excellent fits (Figure S2-2).

For t ∈ [2003, 2014] and where min(t) and max(t) were linearly interpolated between 2003 and 2014 from the lower and upper
bound of the empirically estimated 95% confidence interval of the incarceration rate. For instance, the prior range in 2003 was of
[10.69, 12.41] per 100 PY.
Where the release rate was interpolated between 2003 and 2014.
There was no significant difference in the rate ratios between 2003 and 2014 in the prison survey so it was kept constant over time.

3.2. HCV epidemiology under the status quo
Maintaining the status quo, slight decreases in prevalence (8%; 95% Credible interval (CrI)(Cr): 4–10%) and
incidence (5%; 95%CrI: 1–9%) are expected until 2030,
which may result from a stable population with low community treatment, and harm reduction measures (OAT,
NSP) already in place (Figures 3 and 4). The impact of
all interventions on chronic HCV prevalence, incidence,
prevented fractions, knowledge of HCV status, and fibrosis
stages are presented in the supplementary information for
2030 (Table S2-2).

In the second, 90% of people are tested in prison and 75%
of people diagnosed with chronic HCV are linked to care
for treatment upon release (PB T-L). The remaining two
scenarios are the previous ones evaluated with a hypothetical complementary measure reducing the heightened
post-release risk of HCV by 50% (PB T-Tx + R and PB
T-L + R).

3.3. HCV epidemiology under a community DAA scale-up
If testing and treatment are scaled-up considerably
in the community from 2018 onward, as part of microelimination efforts, substantial decreases in prevalence
(86%; 95%CrI: 81–89%) and incidence (85%; 95%CrI: 79–
88%) could be expected by 2030 (Figures 3 and 4).

3.4. Impact of prison-based test-and-treat
A prison-based test-and-treat intervention (PB T-Tx )
whereby 90% of people are tested and 75% of those diagnosed with chronic infection are treated during their prison
stay would result in relative reductions of 27% (95%CrI: 20–
34%) in prevalence and 19% (95%CrI: 9–28%) for incidence
as compared to 2018. The intervention could also prevent
7% (95%CrI: 20–34%) of new chronic infections over 20182030 (Figures 3-5), which represents 0.3 (95%CrI: 0.2–0.40)
new chronic infections (including re-infection) averted per
person treated (Figure 6).
The epidemiological impact of a prison-based test-andtreat strategy was magnified when combined with a communitybased DAA scale-up (Figures 3 and 4). Treating 75% of
people diagnosed with chronic HCV in prison prevented

2.4. Sensitivity analyses
To assess the sensitivity of model results, we examined the correlations between parameter sets and model
outputs. Specifically, the importance of three main parameters was investigated: 1) the rate ratio for HCV acquisition and transmission post-release, 2) the rate ratio for
re-incarceration, and 3) the degree of assortative mixing by
incarceration history in the community among those never
incarcerated, recently released, and previously incarcerated.
The correlation was examined for all outcomes for the test
and post-release linkage to care scenario (PB T-L).
The model was implemented in Python 3.6 and solved
with a validated Runge-Kutta algorithm of the 4th order
from the SciPy module [45].

years, compared to community-based treatment scale-up

synergistic effects with the community scale-up in terms
of prevalence, incidence, and prevented fraction of new
infections (Figures 3-5). As compared to a communitybased scale-up alone, every additional person treated in
prison averted 1.5 (95%CrI: 0.7–2.0) new chronic infections
(Figure 6).

3.5. Impact of prison-based testing and linkage to care
post-release
If 90% of incarcerated PWID are tested in prison and
75% of those diagnosed with chronic HCV are treated upon
release (PB T-L), relative reductions of 30% (95%CrI: 22–
38%) for prevalence and of 23% (95%CrI: 11–33%) for
incidence, as compared to 2018 levels, are expected by
2030 (Figures 3 and 4). Testing and post-release linkage
to care also prevented 9% (95%CrI 5–14%) of new chronic
infections compared to the status quo, and every additional person treated could avert 0.4 (95%CrI: 0.2–0.5) new
chronic HCV infection (Figures 5 and 6).
Combining this testing and post-release linkage to care
intervention with a community-based DAA scale-up led to
a relative reduction in prevalence of 67% (95%CrI: 53–78%)
compared to the scale-up alone by 2030. The intervention
also lowered transmission, as compared to the community
scale-up alone, by reducing incidence (57%; 95%CrI: 36–
70%) and preventing more new chronic infections (19%;
95%CrI: 11, 27%) (Figures 3-5). This combination also prevented more chronic infection per person treated compared
to the community scale-up alone (1.9; 95%CrI: 0.9–2.6)

3.6. Impact of prison-based interventions and post-release
risk reduction
Both types of prison-based interventions had improved
and sustained impacts when complemented by a hypothetical injecting risk reduction measures in the period following
prison release. Prison-based test-and-treat (PB T-Tx + R)
reduced prevalence and incidence by 32% (95%CrI: 25–41%)
and 30% (95%CrI: 17–41%), respectively. As presented,
the testing and post-release linkage to care intervention
(PB T-L + R) achieved greater prevalence (36%; 95%CrI:
28–45%) and incidence (33%; 95%CrI: 20–45%) reductions,
and prevented 13% (95%CrI: 7–20%) of new chronic infections by 2030 (Figures 3-5). Both interventions (i.e.,
PB T-Tx + R and PB T-L + R) could prevent slightly
more new infections per person treated compared to their
corresponding scenarios without a consideration of risk
reduction measures, with 0.4 (95%CrI: 0.2–0.7) and 0.5
(95%CrI 0.3–0.7) additional chronic HCV averted per person treated for test-and-treat and testing and post-release
linkage to care, respectively (Figure 6).

Model results were primarily influenced by the degree
of assortative mixing between different groups of PWID:
those without experience with the prison system, those
with recent release, and those with previous incarceration.
As PWID mixed more within groups (and the degree of
assortative mixing tended to 1), the relative impact of the
scenario was lower. The increased incarceration rate did
not influence model results much, nor did the rate ratio for
the post-release risk of HCV acquisition and transmission
(Fig. 7).

HCV care in provincial prison settings, and the link between correctional and community services are currently inadequate [5]. Using a dynamic model of HCV transmission
among PWID in Montréal, we showed that prison-based
continuum of care interventions could play a central role
in reducing HCV transmission among PWID. Importantly,
the population-level impact of these interventions could
be super-additive (i.e. more effective) when accompanied
by a community-based DAA scale up. Overall, the results
indicate that a multifaceted HCV response, strengthening
community and prison care cascades, could be pivotal for
launching efficient micro-elimination efforts.
In Québec’s provincial prisons, the sentence length per
incarceration is very short [8, 20, 9]. This raised concerns regarding initiating treatment in prison, since lower
SVR rates have been reported among inmates who are
transferred to other prisons or released on treatment when
compared to those who complete treatment in prison [21].
Test-and-treat interventions may have a greater impact in
settings with longer duration of stay per incarceration, such
as Scotland or federal prisons [13, 19]. In Montréal, interventions involving testing and post-release linkage to care
could lead to larger relative decreases than prison-based
treatment alone in HCV prevalence (30%) and incidence
(23%) compared to the status quo, in part by decreasing
the period during which people are susceptible to HCV
re-infection (i.e., people on treatment cannot acquire HCV).
Yet, the validity of this comparison hinges on achieving
similar treatment rates in prison and post-release. The
increased population health benefits of the linkage to care
scenario could be compromised if higher treatment rates
could be achieved inside prisons. One thing is clear, however, the current HCV care landscape misses out on in-

carcerated PWID and people in provincial prison because
interventions are not tailored to their needs.
The elevated post-release risk of HCV acquisition and
transmission that occurs after release means that people
can be rapidly re-infected with HCV, diminishing the effectiveness of prison-based HCV control measures. Breaking this instability cycle in the post-release period, which
could promote drug use as a coping mechanism, is difficult
[22, 46, 12]. Interventions that only seek to treat individuals are likely insufficient to sustainably reduce transmission
if not complemented by risk-reduction measures in the
post-release period [47]. Our results suggest, as found in
Scotland [13], that integrated models of care in the postrelease period could reduce the risk of HCV acquisition
and transmission, and have the greatest epidemiological
impact, preventing up to 26% of new chronic infections by
2030.
Although a hypothetical intervention reducing the postrelease transmission risk by 50% was modelled in the
present work, several real-world interventions could play
this role and prevent re-infections.Nurse-led interventions
in prison have helped increase treatment compliance, reduce risk behaviours, and manage disease burden: lessons
learned from these successes could be applied for interventions in the post-release period [48, 49, 50]. Similarly,
peer navigator programs could reduce the risk of IDU postrelease and enhance engagement in the healthcare system
by increasing trust, reducing perceived stigma, and improving social determinants of health, such as housing and
employmentt [46, 51, 52].
Prison-based interventions may be important to curb
ongoing transmission among PWID. These become even
more critial in the context of a community-based DAA
scale-up among PWID. In all investigated prison-based
scenarios, treating one additional person could avert new
chronic infections and thi impact was proportionally greater
in the context of a community DAA scale-up. Treating
people in prison or upon release allowed for a better HCV
transmission control, mainly by reducing the risk of onward
transmission in the post-release period [10, 12]. This result
suggests that broad micro-elimination strategies for PWID
should consider prison-based measures, as they target atrisk injecting risk periods more precisely and could use
scarce financial resources more effectively.
Our results should be interpreted considering several
limitations. First, and not unlike other studies, the data
analyzed from the SurvUDI network and prison surveys is
self-reported, and stigmatized injecting behaviours could
have been underreported. For example, HCV prevalence
from surveys in prison could be underestimated if recent
infecting behaviours were underreported by participants
interviewed inside prison walls. Second, even though uncertainty exists regarding available data on the PWID
population size of Montréal, estimates suggest an important decline between 1996 and 2010, from 11,700 to 4,000
active PWID [25]. Without additional evidence post-2010
on demographic trends in the population injecting drugs,

the size of the PWID population was kept stable from 2010
onward. Anecdotal evidence nevertheless suggests that
it could be increasing. Third, the Montréal drug market
has highly diversified in the past years and, while cocaine
remains the main drug of choice, the use of crack and prescription opioids have increased [53, 7]. This could have led
to changes in HCV incidence that were not mechanistically
modelled, as drug type can impact injecting risk behaviours
[54, 55, 53]. Fourth, for the hypothetical linkage to care
scenario we chose a post-release linkage rate that is higher
than that observed in recent studies [56, 57, 58] to reflect
intensive micro-elimination efforts. Using lower linkage
rates would unlikely change the qualitative interpretation
of our findings, which compares the different interventions
in relative terms. Nevertheless, this points to the potential
lower impact of prison-based interventions if linkage and
treatment rates cannot be reached and suggests that HCV
elimination among PWID may only be achieved with a
broad and intensive community-based scale-up of treatment. Finally, our results may only be generalizable to
settings with similar polydrug use patterns, incarceration
dynamics, and patient demographics.
There are several strengths to this study. First, we were
able to replicate HCV epidemic trends in both community
and prison, two settings that are often difficult to study
simultaneously. Second, the data-rich environment of Montréal allowed for robust quantification of model parameters
and inclusion of several calibration outcomes [7, 35, 38].
Third, a 12-week duration and an SVR rate of 90% were
conservatively assumed for DAA therapy, with perfect adherence. However, new drugs with eight-week duration,
assuring treatment completion and SVR, are currently being evaluated in multiple settings and could further enhance
the ease of treating people with chronic HCV in prison or
upon release [59, 60]. Last, parameter uncertainty was considered through Bayesian model calibration and sensitivity
analyses were performed.
5. Conclusion
Sustainably curbing HCV transmission among PWID
in Montréal will require the rapid scale-up of interventions
both in prison and in community settings, and should leverage their synergistic impacts. Prison-based intervention
strategies could have an important impact on the disease
burden in this priority population. Enhancing linkage between community and prison healthcare services would
notably be important in Québec’s provincial prison, where
sentence lengths may be too short to complete treatment.
Nonetheless, intervention programs comprising treatment
in and upon release from prison, based on sentence length,
should also be evaluated in future work. Furthermore,
public health authorities should consider implementing
risk reduction initiatives targeted at the short period soon
after release from prison. Overall, the results presented
above suggest that reaching the goal of HCV elimination

among PWID in Montréal would be facilitated by improving integration and coordination of both correctional and
public health services. In Canada, only three provinces
(Nova Scotia, Alberta, and British Colombia) have integrated prison health care, including HCV, in the Ministry
of Health’s mandate. Elsewhere, the ministry responsible
for corrections oversees healthcare of people in prison [61].
Transitioning toward a more integrated system could prove
challenging, however, and empirical studies should be conducted to assess acceptability, feasibility of such initiatives.
Results from the current study can guide stakeholders to
close the gaps between these two distinct settings, which
will be crucial in the efforts to eliminate HCV but also in
improving the health of a marginalized group of individuals
with limited access and engagement in healthcare.
