Abstract
Background: The pallidofugal pathways are classically subdivided into ansa
lenticularis, lenticular fasciculus, and subthalamic fasciculus. In addition to these three
subsystems, we characterize an anatomical structure that connects the antero-medial
pole of the subthalamic nucleus to the ventral portions of the pallidum, both related to
limbic processing of information. This bundle has been previously considered to form a
part of the ansa lenticularis, however, it shows striking differences on histology and
MRI features compared to the ansa lenticularis, and therefore we suggest to denominate
it ansa subthalamica. Objectives: To describe the ansa subthalamica as a different
structure than the ansa lenticularis, that can be recognized by different methods
(histology, high-field MRI and connectome tractography), including current 3T clinical
imaging. Methods: A complete human brain was histologically processed and
submitted to registration procedures to correct for tissue deformations and
normalization to MNI space. Coordinates of histological structures were then
comparable to high-field (7T) post-mortem and in vivo MRIs, 13 pre-operative 3T
imaging of parkinsonian patients and normative connectome tractography. Mean
intensity gray values for different structures were measured in Susceptibility-Weighted
Images. Results: It was possible to characterize this structure with different methods
and there was significant difference in signal intensity in the ansa subthalamica
(hypointense), compared to the ansa lenticularis (hyperintense). Conclusions: The ansa
subhtalamica may represent the anatomical pathway that connects limbic regions of the
STN and pallidum, and should be investigated as a possible substrate for limbic effects
of stereotactic surgery of the subthalamic region.

Introduction
The first detailed description of the pallidofugal pathways dates from 1895 when
Constantin von Monakow made observations based on histological sections through
diseased human specimens. He subdivided the major fiber systems of the basal ganglia
into ansa lenticularis (Linsenkernschlinge or lenticular nucleus loop), the lenticular
fasciculus, and the subthalamic fasciculus. Subsequent animal research with anterograde
degeneration methods and axonal tracing demonstrated that these three subsystems arise
from different pallidal regions, although this concept has recently been questioned1. The
AL originates in the lateral division of the globus pallidus internus, with a rostral and
medial trajectory, curving around the internal capsule in a medial, posterior, and
superior course to reach the H field of Forel and then the thalamus2. Fibers from LF
originate in the medial subdivision of the GPi and traverse dorsomedially, perforating
the internal capsule, and thus forming the anatomical structure known as Edinger's
comb system3. The SF originates mainly from the GPe, implementing the motor circuit's
“indirect pathway” as it was described by Alexander in 19904.
According to the tripartite functional subdivision of the STN, the ventromedial
aspect of the nucleus processes mainly limbic information 5. Neurons of the medial tip
of the STN project to the ventral pallidum in non-human primates and cats6,7, however
these connections are poorly demonstrated in humans.
Post-mortem techniques for white matter visualization include anatomical
dissection of frozen brains (Klinger's method), histological myelin staining, polarized
light imaging, polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography8 and structural
tensor analysis 9. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, introduced in the
early 1990s10,11, allows an in-vivo connectivity mapping of the human brain

recently, our group has studied serial high thickness histological (430µm) slices under
light- and dark-field microscopy. By increasing the contrast between fiber bundles and
nuclear boundaries13, this method facilitates the delineation and documentation of
neural structures in human post-mortem tissue. In-situ MRI allowed registration of the
whole histological brain to its own scan before the occurrence of tissue processing
deformations, and normalization to MNI space. As such, this high-resolution and highcontrast histological atlas could be directly used in both populational studies14 or to map
individual patient's anatomy15–17. This methodology improves the visualization and
assists volumetric reconstruction of complex anatomical structures and fiber tracts.
With the advance of neuromodulation and DBS techniques targeting
neuropsychiatric disorders, it is important to understand this intricate anatomical region
in humans and envision potential therapeutic strategies. Great therapeutic benefits of
DBS were recorded in the last decades for various movement disorders, with significant
improvement in quality of life of thousands of patients worldwide. This fact motivated
countless scientific studies involving the subthalamic nucleus and the surrounding
areas, as one of the most studied regions in the brain with important discoveries and
clinical correlations. In addition to the three subsytems of fibers described above, we
characterize an anatomical structure that connects the antero-medial pole of the STN to
the ventral portions of the pallidum. It differs in topography, histological features and
magnetic properties from the classically described pallido-subthalamic pathways (Fig.
1). The bundle has been previously considered to form a subset or part of the ansa
lenticularis18. However, it shows striking differences on histology and MRI compared to
this bundle. The material presented here suggests that it should receive nomenclature
that differentiates it from the ansa lenticularis (which largely innervates the thalamus).

Since it terminates in the subthalamic nucleus, we suggest calling this bundle ansa
subthalamica or subthalamic ansa.
To demonstrate the bundles properties, we analyzed high-resolution dark field
histological images in low and high power magnifications. In addition, we investigated
post-mortem and in vivo ultra-high field (7T) imaging from 2 different imaging centers.
Finally, in order to evaluate if the ansa subthalamica could be clearly identified in a
routine clinical setting, we studied 13 pre-operative 3T MRI scans from idiopathic
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.

Methods
Histological brain
The brain of a 56-year-old man with no history of neurological disorders was
donated with written informed consent obtained from the family, according to the
Declaration of Helsinki, as part of a research protocol approved by the Ethics board at
the University of Sao Paulo. In-situ MRI scan was obtained before autopsy (T1: TR =
6.3 ms, TE = 2.9 ms, TI = 791 ms, 240 x 240, 1 x 1 x 1 mm voxels 3D).
The complete brain was

fixed in formalin, embedded in celloidin and

horizontally cut in 430 µm slices and stained using a modified gallocyanin technique19
as previously described13. We corrected tissue processing artifacts with multiple 2D
and 3D registration procedures20 and finally registered the brain volume to a stereotactic
common space (MNI ICBM152 2009b Nlin Asym), providing 3D coherent presentation
of the neuroanatomic boundaries, segmented from the high-resolution dark-field
microscopy images (resolution of 0.0250 x 0.0250 x 0.430 mm).

High-field MRIs
High-field MRI was obtained in two different centers (University of Sao Paulo
Medical School and the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging,

Massachusetts General Hospital). In the University of Sao Paulo, a 36-year-old man,
with no previous diseases was scanned in-vivo in a 7T (Siemens Medical Solutions,
Erlangen, Germany) device. Susceptibility-weighted Imaging (SWI) sequences with
minimal intensity projection (mIP) reconstructions were obtained (0.64 mm isotropic
voxels TR: 23ms, TE: 14 ms, FoV 174mm x 192mm, flip angle 12 degrees) and phase
images show important contrast in the tegmental region (Fig. 2B).
At Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), we scanned a normal brain
specimen donated by a 60-year-old woman who died of non-neurological causes. Her
neurological examination was normal during her last hospitalization prior to death, and
the gross pathological analysis of her brain at autopsy was normal. The brain was fixed
in 10% formalin 24 hours after death. The autopsy and ex vivo MRI analysis was
performed with written informed consent provided by a surrogate decision-maker, in
accordance with a research protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at
MGH.
We scanned the fixed whole brain specimen three months after the patient’s
death on a 7T Siemens Magnetom MRI scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen,
Germany) using a custom-built head coil.

Details regarding the ex vivo scanning

protocol have been previously published21. Briefly, we acquired a multi-echo FLASH
(MEF) sequence22 at 200 µm spatial resolution. Total scan time on the 7T MRI scanner
was 18 hours and 31 minutes. MEF data undergo a series of processing steps, including
creation of parameter maps (e.g. proton density, flash20 and T1 and T2* relaxation
times), which were used to synthesize images using the forward models of FLASH
image formation to obtain high SNR data. For the present study, we analyzed the
synthesized FLASH images using a 20 degree flip angle, based on visual inspection that
revealed optimal delineation of the pallidofugal pathways.

Clinical MRIs
Clinical anonymized MR images for pre-operative scans for DBS surgery in
Parkinson’s disease patients were retrospectively analyzed. Thirteen patients were
studied, 5 women and 8 men (age range: 38-75 years, mean age: 63 years, SD: 8,72
years). A T1 3D MPRAGE (0.90 mm isotropic voxels, TR: 2000 ms, TE: 2.4 ms TI:
925 ms, Flip angle: 8 degrees) and SW images (0.7 mm isotropic voxels, TR: 48 ms,
TE: 30 ms, Flip angle 18 degrees) with mIP reconstructions were analyzed in the
present study. Images were obtained on a 3T Siemens MRI scanner at Hospital
Beneficencia Portuguesa de Sao Paulo (Fig. 2C).

Three-dimensional histological reconstructions
The 3D reconstructions of the structures shown in Fig. 1C-F, were performed
after manual segmentation on high-resolution histological dark-field images (Fig. 1AB). The transformations generated by previous 2D, 3D and MNI registrations were then
applied to the segmented masks. Nuclei were shown as solid structures and the fiber
tracts were submitted to a technique called Histological Mesh Tractography (HMT).
Briefly, inside 3D meshes that were segmented for each fiber tract, streamlines are
generated using a finite volume method based simulation of waterflow in the
computational

(https://www.openfoam.com/) and exported for visualization in the same stereotactic
space as the original meshes.

Clinical MRI analysis
Our primary goal was to verify if the ansa lenticularis and the ansa subthalamica
had also different magnetic properties in SWI images due to differential iron content

within each structure. To achieve that goal, the MRIs of the 13 patients were normalized
to MNI ICBM152 2009b Nlin Asym space using Lead DBS software

23

and a modern

three-stage non-linear method (Advanced Normalization Tools)24. We measured signal
intensities in the histologically defined coordinates for the STN, GPi (already known to
be rich in iron content25 and decreased signal in SW images), ansa subthalamica, ansa
lenticularis, the anterior part of internal capsule (rich in perforating fibers) and the
posterior part of internal capsule. The signal intensities were automatically normalized
in SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). To further normalize
intensities, these were scaled using the anterior commissure as a reference point. The zcoordinate (-6.5 mm) was chosen to be the most representative axial slice of the ansa
subthalamica.
The statistical analysis was performed for 13 MRI scans (n=26) with a one-way
ANOVA test computed in the statistical JASP software (https://jasp-stats.org/). Post hoc
Tukey’s test was performed and Cohen’s d factor was also calculated to verify
respectively statistical difference among groups of structures and effect sizes of those
differences (Table 1).

Results
Figures 1A and B depict the ansa subthalamica as a conspicuous bundle of fibers
coursing between the antero-medial pole of the STN and the ventro-medial portions of
the GPi, at levels below the anterior commissure. The ansa lenticularis was composed of
white matter fibers derived from the accessory medullary lamina and from the internal
medullary lamina, whereas the pallidal portion of this bundle arches adjacent to the
medial to border of the GPi, and lateral to the Comb system. These fibers form a
separate bundle connecting the anteromedial pole of the STN with the medial portions

was a significant statistical difference (p<0.05) between groups (Table).
Effect sizes in differences of image intensities expressed by Cohen's d factors
showed that GPi, STN and ansa subthalamica have smaller differences among them (0.31 to 0.86 SD), while the anterior IC is in an intermediate position between the
GPi/STN/ansa subthalamica group and the posterior IC/ansa lenticularis group.
Posterior IC and ansa lenticularis have smaller differences between them (1.12 SD), but
larger differences to GPi, STN and ansa subthalamica (3.90 to 4.76 SD) (Table 1). The
analyzed regions could be divided in 3 groups: hypointense (GPi, STN, and ansa
subthalamica), isointense (anterior IC) and hyperintense (posterior IC and ansa
lenticularis) in susceptibility weighted images.

Discussion
Since Auguste Forel's original descriptions in 187726, much of the classical
literature on the tegmental area has focused on confined assessment of coronal planes of
sections in humans. On a coronal plane, the ansa subthalamica and ansa lenticularis can
be mistaken from one another (Fig. 1D). Riley characterized the AS as a subdivision of
the AL under the term fibrae pallido-subthalamicae18. The ansa subthalamica, however,
differs anatomically from the ansa lenticularis on MRI intensity, histological properties
and trajectory (Fig. 1A-F). While the ansa lenticularis traverses from the GPi to the
thalamus, the ansa subthalamica runs from the GPi to the STN. We thus argue that the
two are separate and distinguishable pathways and the ansa subthalamica is not part of
the ansa lenticularis.
The susceptibility weighted Imaging (SWI) is particularly sensitive to
paramagnetic and diamagnetic compounds such as deoxyhemoglobin, ferritin, bone
minerals and calcifications, causing drop of signal. Pallidofugal and striatonigral
pathways have been visualized in vivo using SWI contrasts and the tubular structures in
the vicinity of the STN and substantia nigra proved to represent fiber tracts rather than
veins in previous studies27. The hypointensity in the basal ganglia regions in SWI is
probably due to the presence of iron25. Minimum intensity projection (mIP) images
augment this effect for smaller regions. The signal is similar to STN and GPi within the
ansa subthalamica. Instead, the ansa lenticularis was hyperintense (likely due to poor
iron content), similar to the posterior portions of the IC. The intermediate signal of the
anterior IC might be explained by the FS projections that traverse through the internal
capsule and reach the STN (Edinger's comb system). Here, iron-rich projections cross
the iron-poor IC, generating an intermediate signal. The hypointense signal from the

ansa subthalamica also has a ventral projection to the substantia nigra. These projections
from GPi to the SNr first follow the course of the ansa subthalamica, but then extend
ventrally. Basal ganglia connectivity studies have confirmed the presence of the
connections between STN and GPi as well as GPi and SNr using high-field MRI in
humans28,29, but no detailed anatomical description was provided.
The ansa subthalamica connects the anterior and ventral parts (below the
anterior commissure level) of the pallidum, to the anterioventral part of the STN 1- both
of which have been attributed to predominantly limbic processing. This suggests that
the ansa subthalamica may primarily convey limbic information. Instead, motor
connections of the STN to GP are likely implemented in the SF, on the dorsolateral
aspects of the STN1. Given the widely described cross-talk between motor-, associative
and limbic loops in the basal ganglia and on level of the cortex, the ansa subthalamica
may still play a crucial part within the fronto-striato-subthallamo-pallidal network
engaged in goal directed behaviors and habitual inhibition30. These implications, which
presently remain speculative, have potential translational relevance in the field of deep
brain stimulation to the subthalamic region in motor and psychiatric disorders.
In summary, we provide a comprehensive description of the ansa subthalamica
as a distinct fiber bundle from the ansa lenticularis, lenticular fasciculus and
subthalamic fasciculus in the human pallido-subthalamic circuitry. The ansa
subthalamica connects the antero-medial STN to the ventral aspects of the GPi and is
recognizable not only in histological preparations but also on high-field MRI,
connectome tractography, and in clinical MRI scans of PD patients in iron-sensitive
sequences. It may represent the anatomical pathway that connects limbic regions of the
STN and pallidum, and should be investigated as a possible substrate for the effects of
