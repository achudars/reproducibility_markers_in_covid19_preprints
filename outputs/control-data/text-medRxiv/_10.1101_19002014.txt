Abstract
Background: Emerging work has demonstrated that histologically normal (non-tumor) tissue adjacent to
breast tumor tissue shows evidence of molecular alterations related to tumorigenesis, referred to as field
cancerization effects. Although changes in DNA methylation are known to occur early in breast
carcinogenesis and the landscape of breast tumor DNA methylation is profoundly altered compared with
normal tissue, there have been limited efforts to identify DNA methylation field cancerization effects in
histologically normal breast tissue adjacent to tumor.
Methods: Matched tumor, histologically normal tissue of the ipsilateral breast (ipsilateral-normal), and
histologically normal tissue of the contralateral breast (contralateral-normal) were obtained from nine
women undergoing bilateral mastectomy. Laser capture microdissection was used to select breast
epithelial cells from normal tissues, and neoplastic cells from tumor specimens for genome-scale
measures of DNA methylation with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array.
Results: We identified substantially more CpG loci that were differentially methylated between
contralateral-normal breast and tumor tissue (63,271 CpG loci q < 0.01), than between ipsilateral-normal
tissue and tumor (38,346 CpG loci q < 0.01). In addition, we identified differential methylation in
ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue (9,562 CpG loci p < 0.01). Hypomethylated loci
in ipsilateral normal relative to contralateral were significantly enriched for breast cancer-relevant
transcription factor binding sites including those for ESR1, FoxA1, and GATA3. Hypermethylated loci in
ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue were significantly enriched for CpG island shore
regions.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that early hypermethylation events in breast carcinogenesis are more
likely to occur in the regions immediately surrounding CpG islands than CpG islands per se, reflecting a
field effect of the tumor on surrounding histologically normal tissue. This work offers an opportunity to
focus investigations of early DNA methylation alterations in breast carcinogenesis and potentially
develop epigenetic biomarkers of disease risk.

Background
Breast cancer is the most diagnosed non-keratinocyte cancer and is responsible for the second highest
number of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States, with over 40,000 women estimated
to die from breast cancer in 2019 in the United States alone [1]. It has been shown that the breast
methylome varies greatly between histologically normal tissue and tumor tissue [2], and such variation is
related in part to age, parity, and alcohol consumption, among other factors [3,4]. Work assessing the
methylome of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has demonstrated that alterations to DNA methylation
occur early in breast carcinogenesis [5,6]. Due to the invasive nature of sample collection, molecular
studies are conducted as a comparison between tumor and histologically normal tissue adjacent to the
tumor (subsequently referred to as adjacent normal) tissue. However, given that alterations to DNA
methylation have been identified at the early stages of breast carcinogenesis, it is currently unknown
whether adjacent normal tissue is reflective of normal breast epithelium at the molecular level. This
limitation may lead to an incomplete understanding of tumor development or an attenuation of the
measured magnitude of epigenetic differences.
If a field effect of the tumor on adjacent histologically normal tissue occurs in breast cancer, the use of
adjacent normal tissue as a referent sample in molecular studies would inhibit our ability to identify the
earliest molecular alterations that occur in carcinogenesis. Therefore, assessment of possible field
cancerization effects in breast cancer is critical to informing our understanding of early carcinogenesis.
A recent study demonstrated evidence of alterations to DNA methylation related to tumorigenesis in
histologically normal tissue adjacent to breast tumors, suggestive of a field cancerization effect in breast
cancer [7]. However, this study was conducted comparing adjacent normal tissue in women with breast
cancer to normal breast tissue in women without breast cancer. While comparing cancer-free control
tissue from one set of study participants with adjacent normal tissue from an independent set of

participants provides initial evidence of field cancerization effects, it may obscure the extent to which
DNA methylation profiles reflect individual differences/exposures and thereby modify the field effect
profile. To our knowledge, no study to-date has shown evidence of field effects in breast cancer using
subject-matched tumor tissue, histologically normal tissue from the ipsilateral breast (ipsilateral-normal),
and histologically normal tissue from the contralateral breast (contralateral-normal). Furthermore, most
prior research assessing alterations to DNA methylation in breast tumors has leveraged bulk tissue
samples which may confound results due to underlying differences in the cellular composition of
collected tissue. In the present study, we present evidence of field effects in breast cancer, using subjectmatched, laser capture microdissected tumor, ipsilateral-normal, and contralateral-normal samples from
nine women undergoing bilateral mastectomy.

Methods
Study population
This was a retrospective study using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissue blocks
from treatment-naïve women who had undergone bilateral mastectomies (tumor mastectomy and
prophylactic contralateral mastectomy) at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, MA and who were
enrolled in the Rays of Hope Center for Breast Research Registry (IRB Baystate Health, Springfield, MA
protocol number 568088).
Laser-capture microdissection and DNA isolation
Breast tumor, ipsilateral-normal, and contralateral-normal tissue blocks were identified and pulled for
each of 9 women. H&E stained sections of the tumor and benign samples were used to estimate the total
area for microdissection; a minimum of 5 x 106 μm2 was required to ensure sufficient material for
adequate DNA yield (~800 ng minimum). There was insufficient tumor tissue available for one woman.
Consecutive tissue sections (6-μm thick) were cut and mounted on membrane slides (MMI, Rockledge,
FL). For tumor blocks, every 4th section was H&E stained and the tumor tissue was marked by a breast
pathologist (GMC). For ipsilateral-normal samples, benign glandular areas were selected from blocks that

were 3 cm from the tumor tissue. For contralateral-normal samples, benign glandular areas were selected.
For both ipsilateral and contralateral samples, glandular tissue was marked on an H&E slide by a
pathologist (GMC). For each sample the 6-μm sections mounted on membrane slides were deparaffinized
in 3 changes of Xylene and allowed to air dry under vacuum in a desiccator for 30 min prior to the lasercapture microdissection. The unstained sections were oriented for microdissection aided by landmarks
defined on the H&E stained slides. Areas to be microdissected were circumscribed using MMI Cell Tools
software (Version Celltools-4.4 #261, Rockledge FL). Microdissected tumor, ipsilateral-normal, and
contralateral-normal samples from each patient were collected separately onto caps. The collected tissue
was placed in 150 L digestion buffer containing 10 L proteinase K, kept overnight at 55C, and stored
at -80C until further processing. DNA was isolated using the manufacturer’s protocol for the BiOstic
DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (MoBio).
DNA methylation profiling
DNA samples were sent to the Molecular Genomics/Methylation Core at the University of Southern
California. Bisulfite treatment with the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo) was performed and modified
DNA was assessed with four PCR reactions to estimate quantity and test for complete bisulfite conversion
[8]. DNA samples that passed the PCR quality controls were amplified at 37°C for 20-24 hours after
treatment with 0.1N NaOH. The DNA was fragmented at 37°C for 1 hour and subsequently precipitated
in 100% 2-propanol at 4°C for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation at 3000xg at 4°C for 20 minutes.
Dried DNA-pellets were resuspended in hybridization buffer at 48°C for 1 hour, denatured for 20 minutes
at 95°C and loaded onto the Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip, and hybridized at 48°C for 16-24 hours.
Unhybridized and non-specific DNA was removed using wash buffers. After a single base extension of
the hybridized primers using labeled nucleotides, the BeadChip was stained with Cy-3 and Cy-5
fluorescent dyes and read using the Illumina iScan Reader.

Sample intensity data (IDAT) files were processed with the R package minfi using the “Funnorm”
normalization method on the full dataset. CpGs with a detection p value > 1E-06 in more than 5% of
samples, CpGs with high frequency SNP(s) in the probe, probes previously described to be potentially
cross-hybridizing, and sex-specific probes were filtered. Samples with more than 10% of probes above
the detection p value or with bisulfite conversion intensity less than 3 standard deviations of the mean
were removed.
One ipsilateral-normal sample was removed due to poor sample quality (>10% of probes above the
detection p value). From an original set of 853,307 measured CpG loci on the Illumina
HumanMethylationEPIC array (EPIC), our filtering steps removed 96,564 probes exceeding the detection
p value limit, 71,478 probes that were SNP associated or cross-hybridizing, and 15,585 sex-specific
probes. The final data for analysis resulted in 683,209 CpG loci measured in 25 matched samples from
nine women (Table 1) from tumor tissue (n = 8), ipsilateral-normal tissue (n = 8), and contralateralnormal tissue (n = 9).
Statistical analysis
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was conducted based on Manhattan distance and using the 10,000
CpG loci that demonstrated the most variability in methylation beta value across all samples.
To quantify differential methylation, pairwise comparisons were run on logit-transformed methylation
beta values (M-values) between contralateral-normal and tumor tissue, ipsilateral-normal and tumor
tissue, and contralateral-normal and ipsilateral-normal tissue. Linear mixed-effect models were performed
to model the relation between tissue type (tumor relative to contralateral-normal, tumor relative to
ipsilateral-normal, and ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal, respectively) and CpG
methylation M-value, controlling for age and parity and allowing a random effect for each subject. Due to
the limited sample size of the study, we utilized nominal significance levels of p < 0.01 for subsequent
analyses and interpretations.
To classify the genomic context of identified differentially methylated CpG loci, annotation data for the
Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array was used to identify the relation to CpG islands for each probe.

The UCSC Genome Browser UCSC_hg19_refGene file was used to define promoters, exons, introns, and
intergenic regions and the R package GenomicRanges was used to map these regions to all CpG loci on
the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. In cases where CpG loci mapped to more than one genomic
region, loci were preferentially assigned to promoters, then exons, and then introns such that each locus
only had one associated genomic region.
Gene set enrichment analyses of identified differentially methylated CpG loci were conducted using the
gometh function from the missMethyl package in R [9]. In brief, this method assesses enrichment of
represented gene ontology (GO) terms among a set of differentially methylated CpG loci relative to a
specified background set while adjusting for potential bias introduced by differences in the number of
probes that map to each gene leading to altered probability of identifying a differentially methylated locus
across different genes.
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and p values for the enrichment
of CpG island contexts, adjusting for Illumina probe type, among CpG loci that were significantly
hypomethylated or hypermethylated (p < 0.01) in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal
tissue, compared to all other CpG loci included in the analysis.
To assess possible enrichment of regulatory elements among hypomethylated and hypermethylated (p <
0.01) loci, respectively, in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue, we utilized Locus
Overlap Analysis (LOLA) [10] using Cistrome data for MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines from
the LOLA core database for hg19. In brief, LOLA conducts a Fisher’s Exact Test for the enrichment of
the identified differentially methylated loci relative to a specified background set (here specified as the
683,209 loci included in the analysis) overlapping with specified regulatory elements.
Methylation status of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements were
predicted using the REMP package in R [11]. Median value of Alu and LINE-1 were subsequently
calculated across all reported regions for each sample. Median Alu and LINE-1 methylation status was
then compared between tissue types using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Results
Global trends in DNA methylation suggest differences between ipsilateral-normal and contralateralnormal breast tissue
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using mean methylation beta values of the top 10,000 most variable
probes across the three tissue types showed clear separation between tumor and normal (ipsilateral or
contralateral) tissue (Figure 1). Among the cluster of normal tissue, some samples clustered by subject
(subjects 4, 7, and 8) while some samples appeared to separate by the breast from which they were
collected (ipsilateral or contralateral). When assessing the methylation status of Alu and long interspersed
nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements, there was a statistically significant decrease in median
Alu element methylation in tumor relative to contralateral-normal tissue (p = 0.03) while no statistically
significant differences were observed in ipsilateral-normal tissue relative to tumor or contralateral-normal
tissue (Figure S1). However, there was visual suggestion of a trend in decreased Alu element methylation
across contralateral-normal, ipsilateral-normal, and tumor tissue respectively. No statistically significant
differences were observed in the methylation status of LINE-1 elements across tissue types.
Contralateral-normal tissue provides a distinct reference epigenome compared to ipsilateral-normal
tissue
At an FDR cutoff of q < 0.01, a total of 38,346 CpG loci were identified as differentially methylated in
tumor tissue relative to ipsilateral-normal tissue (Figure 2B). However, when comparing tumor tissue to
contralateral-normal tissue, 63,271 CpG loci were identified as differentially methylated (Figure 2A), a
65% increase. Furthermore, among those differentially methylated loci, 33,657 (88% of those identified
as differentially methylated using ipsilateral-normal as the referent tissue and 53% of those identified as
differentially methylated using contralateral-normal as there referent tissue) were identified in both
comparisons (Figure 2C) with consistent directionality of association in tumor relative to the respective
referent tissue.
In a sensitivity analysis removing the contralateral normal-sample from the subject whose ipsilateralnormal sample was removed from analysis during QC due to > 10% of probes being above the specified

detection p value (Subject 1) to allow for matched sample size across comparisons, a modest decrease
was observed in the number of loci identified as differentially methylated (Figure S2). However, there
remained a 23% increase in the number of differentially methylated loci observed relative to the
comparison using ipsilateral-normal tissue as the referent tissue.
To further assess whether the observed increase in differentially methylated CpGs were functionally
redundant and reflected more loci from the same genes being identified as differentially methylated, we
investigated the overlap in genes and gene sets. The 38,346 differentially methylated CpG loci identified
when comparing tumor to ipsilateral-normal tissue mapped to 9,800 unique genes. Conversely, the 63,271
differentially methylated CpG loci identified when using contralateral-normal as the referent tissue
mapped to 12,887 genes, 9,283 of which were overlapping with those identified in the tumor relative to
ipsilateral-normal comparison.
We used the gometh function from the missMethyl package in R to conduct gene set enrichment analyses
accounting for the bias of the number of probes representing each gene on the EPIC array to assess gene
sets that were enriched among the 29,614 CpG loci identified as differentially methylated in tumor
relative to contralateral-normal tissue that were not identified when using ipsilateral normal tissue as the
referent tissue. These 29,614 were compared to the background set of all 63,271 differentially methylated
loci identified between tumor and contralateral-normal tissue to investigate GO terms that may be
uniquely implicated in early carcinogenesis. We identified significant enrichment of (q < 0.01) 83 GO
terms with the most significantly enriched GO terms relating to biological processes such as cell death,
metabolic processes, and tissue development (Table S1).
Hypomethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue are enriched for
transcription factor binding sites implicated in breast carcinogenesis
In analyses comparing ipsilateral-normal to contralateral-normal tissue, 9,562 CpG loci were identified as
differentially methylated between the two histologically normal tissue types at a nominal significance
threshold of p < 0.01 (Figure 2D). Given differences in the biological interpretation of hypomethylation

and hypermethylation, respectively, subsequent analyses were stratified by the direction of the identified
association.
Among the 9,562 differentially methylated loci, 4,942 were identified as hypomethylated in ipsilateralnormal relative to contralateral-normal tissue (Table S2). These hypomethylated loci demonstrated
significant enrichment for CpG sparse open sea regions (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.66, 1.88; p = 5.1 x 10-63)
and significant depletion for all other CpG island associated genomic contexts (Figure 3A).
To further explore possible regulatory roles of differentially methylated CpG loci in ipsilateral-normal
relative to contralateral-normal tissue we next assessed enrichment for transcription factor binding sites
(TFBSs), using the Locus Overlap Analysis (LOLA) software tool. Using the LOLA core database for
hg19, we assessed enrichment for these loci at TFBSs using Cistrome data for the breast cancer cell lines
MCF-7 and T47D. Comparing the identified hypomethylated loci (p < 0.01) in ipsilateral-normal relative
to contralateral-normal tissue to the background set of all 683,209 loci included in our epigenome-wide
association study, we identified statistically significant enrichment of TFBSs for c-Fos, ESR1, FoxA1,
GATA3, RAD21, RARA, RARG, and SRC-3 using MCF-7 data and ESR1, FoxA1, and PGR using
T47D data (all q < 0.05, Figure 4). This suggests that cellular programs regulated by transcription factors
known to be dysregulated in invasive breast cancer also contribute to early events in breast
carcinogenesis.
Hypermethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue are depleted for CpG
islands but enriched for adjacent shore regions
While the 4,620 loci identified as hypermethylated in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal
tissue (Table S3) also demonstrated modest enrichment for open sea regions (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00,
1.13, p = 0.044), they also demonstrated significant depletion for CpG island regions (OR = 0.65; 95%
CI: 0.59, 0.71, p = 6.8 x 10-20) but significant enrichment for CpG island north shore region (OR = 1.13;
95% CI: 1.03, 1.23; p = 0.010) and south shore region (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.33; p = 5.7 x 10-5;
Figure 3B). As not all CpG islands track to promoter regions, we further assessed enrichment of
hypermethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal breast tissue restricting only to promoter CpG islands. This

analysis demonstrated further depletion for CpG island regions (OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.66; p = 8.2 x
10-18) and further enrichment for CpG island south shore regions (OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.45, p = 4.8
x 10-5; Figure 3B). In contrast, when assessing the genomic context distribution among the 71,407
hypermethylated loci in tumor relative to contralateral-normal tissue (p < 0.01), strong enrichment for
both CpG island regions (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.49, 1.55; p = 1.9 x 10-319) and bordering CpG island north
shore (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.37; 1.7 x 10-110) and south shore regions was observed (OR = 1.31;
95% CI: 1.28, 1.35, p = 5.2 x 10-85; Figure 3C). Using the LOLA core database for hg19, no statistically
significant enrichments for TFBSs were identified among the hypermethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal
relative to contralateral-normal tissue.

Discussion
Our findings suggest that within the same patient, histologically normal breast tissue from the same breast
as a tumor is epigenetically distinct from histologically normal tissue from the opposite breast.
Furthermore, histologically normal tissue collected from the breast without the tumor appears to be more
epigenetically distinct from tumor tissue than histologically normal tissue collected from the same breast
as the tumor. This is suggestive of a field cancerization effect of the tumor on surrounding histologically
normal tissue.
While differences between ipsilateral-normal and contralateral-normal tissue were modest and did not
achieve statistical significance at an FDR threshold of q < 0.05, our study was limited by small sample
size. Furthermore, differentially methylated CpG loci at a nominal significance threshold of p < 0.01 were
significantly enriched for regions of functional significance including CpG island shore regions and tissue
specific regulatory regions. This suggests that these differences may have important implications for the
regulation of gene expression between the two tissue types.
Furthermore, enrichment of CpG island shore regions but depletion of CpG island regions among
hypermethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue, with greater magnitudes
of enrichment and depletion observed when restricting to gene promoter regions, suggests that the earliest

molecular alterations in carcinogenesis might appear as hypermethylation of CpG island shore regions
and that these early alterations may also be present in histologically normal tissue surrounding the tumor.
These findings are further supported by existing work demonstrating methylation encroachment at the
borders of CpG islands in breast cancer and prostate cancer cells [12], suggesting that hypermethylation
of promoter regions over the course of carcinogenesis might begin at CpG island shores and progress into
the islands.
Histologically normal tissue in the breast harboring tumor also shows evidence of early molecular
alterations that may be implicated in carcinogenesis among loci that are hypomethylated in this tissue
relative to contralateral-normal tissue. These loci demonstrate enrichment for binding sites for
transcription factors previously implicated in breast cancer, suggesting that hypomethylation of these loci
may play a role in transcriptional regulation.
We did not identify significant differences between the methylation status of Alu and LINE-1 repetitive
elements across tissue types. While previous work has identified hypomethylation of these repetitive
elements over the course of carcinogenesis [13], these findings were subtype-specific. Therefore, given
our limited sample size, it is unclear whether such associations might be observed given the lack of power
to stratify analyses by molecular subtype.
Observed differences have important implications for molecular research in which histologically normal
tissue adjacent to a tumor is used as a comparison group when evaluating for molecular alterations in
tumor tissue. Given that our study collected ipsilateral-normal tissue at a distance of 3 cm from the tumor,
1 cm more distal from the tumor than the TCGA specified 2 cm minimum distance for the collection of
adjacent normal tissue, this is suggestive that adjacent normal tissue may not be an adequate referent
tissue. The observed effect of the tumor/tumor microenvironment on adjacent normal tissue may attenuate
results when adjacent normal tissue is used as a comparison. In such cases, research may fail to identify
significant differences at certain loci between tumor tissue and healthy breast tissue within the same
individual due to an unquantified field cancerization effect on the referent tissue. Furthermore, those loci
may reflect the earliest alterations to DNA methylation in breast carcinogenesis and, therefore, failing to

identify alterations at these loci may limit our understanding of early carcinogenesis. Our findings suggest
that additional research is needed to identify molecular differences between breast tumors and normal
breast tissue that previous research utilizing histologically normal adjacent tissue may have been unable
to capture.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that histologically normal tissue collected from the same breast as the tumor harbors
field cancerization and is not an ideal referent tissue for identifying breast tumor DNA methylation
alterations, particularly early events in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our results suggest that early
hypermethylation events in breast carcinogenesis are more likely to occur in the regions immediately
surrounding CpG islands than CpG islands. This work offers an opportunity to focus investigations of
early DNA methylation alterations in breast carcinogenesis and potentially develop epigenetic biomarkers
of disease risk.

Figure 2 Epigenome-wide association analyses identifying CpG sites that are significantly differentially
methylated in (A) tumor relative to contralateral-normal tissue and (B) tumor relative to ipsilateral-normal
tissue. The beta coefficient reflects the difference in M-value associated with tissue type, adjusted for
subject age and parity. Red dashed lines indicate a significance threshold of q < 0.01 and black dashed
lines indicate a significance threshold of q < 0.05. CpGs are colored (red) by sites identified as significant
in the tumor versus contralateral-normal tissue (q < 0.01) analysis. (C) Overlap (green) between
