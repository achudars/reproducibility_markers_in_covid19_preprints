Abstract (Word count: 187/200)

Background: Strategies for breast cancer prevention are informed by assessing whether

incidence differs by tumour biology. We describe temporal trends of breast cancer

incidence by molecular subtypes in Scotland.

Methods: Population-based cancer registry data on 72,217 women diagnosed with incident

primary breast cancer from 1997 to 2016 were analysed. Age-standardised rates (ASR) and

age-specific incidence were estimated by tumour subtype after imputing the 8% of missing

oestrogen receptor (ER) status. Joinpoint regression and age- period- cohort models were

used to assess whether significant differences were observed in incidence trends by ER

status.

Results: ER positive tumour incidence steadily increased particularly for women of screening

age 50 to 69 years from 1997 till around 2011 (1.6%/year, 95%CI: 1.2 to 2.1). ER negative

incidence decreased among all ages at a consistent rate of -0.7%/year (95%CI: -1.5, 0) from

around 2000-2016. Compared to the 1941-1959 central birth cohort, women born 1912-

1940 had lower incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ER+ tumours and women born 1960- 1986

had higher IRR for ER- tumours.

Conclusions: We show evidence of aetiologic heterogeneity of breast cancer. Future

incidence and survival reporting should be monitored by molecular subtypes.

Background

Breast cancer incidence is rising and it is the most common cancer among women

worldwide (1). It is well established that breast cancer is not a single disease but comprises

multiple subtypes, with oestrogen receptor (ER) expression a key marker of prognostic and

aetiologic significance (2). ER+ tumours, which are amenable to targeted anti-oestrogenic

therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, are the most common type of breast

cancers accounting for 65-75% of breast cancer cases in developed populations (3).

Progesterone receptor (PR) is also a common marker of hormone responsiveness that is

highly correlated with ER. Tumour over-expression of the human epidermal growth factor

receptor 2 (HER2) was discovered two decades ago. This laid the foundation for biological

therapies, which were shown to be clinically effective in treating tumours expressing HER2

and has been widely available in the UK since 2006 (4). ER- tumours do not express any of

the hormone receptors described above and are rarer, have an earlier age of onset and

worse prognosis than ER+ tumours, in part because fewer targeted treatments are available

than for ER+ tumours. In addition to prognostic differences, epidemiologic studies have

shown aetiologic differences by tumour subtypes (5, 6).

There are limited population cancer registries that collect ER, PR and HER2 data, the key

distinguishing markers for molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Recent analyses support

divergent incidence trends by ER status in the United States, Denmark and Ireland, with ER+

breast cancer incidence increasing and ER- breast cancer incidence decreasing (7-9). Data on

combination of subtypes using ER, PR, and HER2 are even more limited, with few reports

from the UK (10-12). ER, PR and HER2 molecular markers are used often as surrogates for

the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer defined by mRNA expression profiling (13) because,

unlike genetic profiling,

the markers have been measured routinely in recent years . In the

age of precision medicine, quantifying and monitoring cancer incidence by molecular

subtypes is important in optimising public health prevention programmes, the allocation of

resources and availability of screening, diagnostic and therapeutic services, and for

improving outcomes (14). An important aspect of assessing trends by ER status is to account

for missing data, as completeness of marker data has improved over time, but imputation

methods can be applied to address this limitation (7-9, 15).

Within Scotland’s renowned, high-quality routine electronic health records, the Scottish

cancer registry is an excellent resource to investigate temporal trends in cancer incidence.

Data collection began for ER in 1997 and PR and HER2 in 2009 and so provides data almost a

decade earlier than other UK national registries. While monitoring of breast cancer

incidence in the UK is standard (16, 17), these data have not been presented by molecular

subtypes. Further, recent changes in risk factors, such as, changes over time in reproductive

factors and increasing obesity prevalence and alcohol consumption may have greater

impact on ER+ specific breast cancer incidence rates compared to ER- given weaker/null

associations with these subtypes (6, 18-20).

Here we report on breast cancer incidence trends in Scotland by ER and ER/HER2

combinations using several statistical methods: 1) Age-standardised and age-specific

incidence rates, which are typically used to report cancer statistics (21); 2) Joinpoint

regression models to determine whether significant changes occurred during 1997-2016,

and the speed at which they have occurred (22); and 3) Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models

(23-25) based on generalized linear model theory to enable description of age, period and

birth cohort effects to provide possible clues to potential underlying factors contributing to

incidence trends, and to thereby inform public health and NHS programmes.

Methods

D a ta a nd c o ho rt d e f i n i t io n

All primary invasive breast cancers (defined on the basis of the International Classification of

Diseases, 10

th

revision code of C50) diagnosed in women aged 20+ years, between 1997 and

2016 were ascertained from the Scottish cancer registry held by Information Services

Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland. The Scottish cancer registry achieves 98%

breast cancer case ascertainment and is over 99% complete (26). Supplemental Figure 1

describes the creation of the final study population. Women with primary breast cancer are

the basis for analysis, each characterised by her worst-prognosis tumour. Permission for use

of the data was obtained from the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel (PBPP) of NHS Scotland

(reference number 1718-0057) and analyses were conducted in the Scottish National Safe

Haven.

Additional demographic and tumour data obtained were: age at diagnosis, NHS Scotland

regions (North, South East and West), tumour grade (grade I-well differentiated to III-poorly

differentiated), tumour size (less than 10mm, 10-20mm and more than 20mm), nodal

involvement (yes or no), screen-detected tumour (yes or no) and the status of molecular

markers ER, PR and HER2 (positive, negative or unknown). ER and PR status is measured

using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 status was assessed using fluorescent in-situ

hybridization. Previous studies have noted that assessment of ER status reliability is high

with an error rate below 5% (27). ER/HER2 combinations were used as surrogates for the

four intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, the gold standard for which uses mRNA expression

profiling. ER+/HER2- was used as surrogate for Luminal A tumours, ER+/HER2+ for Luminal

B, ER-/HER2+ for HER2 enriched tumours and ER-HER2- for triple negative tumours. The

high quality of these data has been previously described (28).

S ta ti s t i c al me t ho ds

Missing ER and ER/HER2 status were imputed conditioned on age and year of diagnosis,

with the assumption that data were missing at random, using a validated method (7-9). Age-

standardised incidence rates (ASR) per 100,000 women were calculated using the direct

method, the European standard population (2013) (29) and mid-year estimates of the

Scottish population for each age and year (30). Age-specific incidence rates were calculated

for 5-year age groups (20-24 to 90+) and individual calendar years using two approaches:

with number of tumours as the numerator for consistency with routine reporting and with

one tumour per women as the numerator for all other analyses. ASR were calculated for all

age groups combined and for three separate age-groups, with the middle group defined on

the basis of eligibility for routine breast screening in Scotland, (20 to 49 years, 50 to 69 years

and more than 70 years); and for each ER status and ER/HER2 combinations.

Joinpoint regression models were used to describe breast cancer incidence rates overall, by

ER status and ER/PR/HER2 combinations for all women in the cohort and for three age

groups (20-49, 50-69 and 70+ years). Joinpoint models describe if changes in the incidence

trends occur and identify the time points at which a change is observed (referred to as

joinpoints). The permutation test method, as described by Kim et al (22), was used

iteratively: it starts by testing the null hypothesis of a simple model with zero joinpoints

against the alternative hypothesis of a more complex model with the maximum number of

joinpoints previously specified (3 joinpoints for this study). The procedure continues until all

possible numbers of joinpoints have been tested. In the final model, the estimated annual

percentage change (EAPC) for each of the periods identified is calculated. The average

annual percent change (AAPC) is also reported as a measure of the overall trend from 1997

to 2016. Joinpoint regression software was used for all the analysis (31).

APC models were fitted for age-standardised incidence of ER+ and ER- tumours. The APC

model provides a unique set of best-fitting log incidence rates obtained by maximum

likelihood estimators for period, age and cohort, which has been shown to provide similar

rates to ASR, but allows investigation of differences by birth cohorts--with the middle cohort

as referent-- which are not investigated in ASR or joinpoint regression analysis. As a

consequence of small numbers in some strata, we restricted these models to women aged

30 to 85 years and used 28 two-year age groups (from 30-31 to 84-85) and 10 two-year

periods (from 1997-1998 to 2015-2016) of calendar year of diagnosis, which covered birth

cohorts from 1912 to 1986. The net drift, similar to the EAPC and AAPC estimate, is reported

with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Local drifts were also estimated and describe the annual

percentage change for each age-specific rate over time (32). In addition, period and cohort

rate ratios are also presented to compare the age-specific rates in each period or cohort

with the reference points in the middle of the study period and distribution of the birth

cohort (2006 for period and 1949 for cohort). Along with cohort rate ratios, a combination

test of significance for the complete cohort deviations is reported. This new combination

test (32) aims to determine if there is an association of the observed rates with the birth

cohorts above the linear influences represented by the net drift . The test provides a more

robust method than the traditional Wald test while correcting for multiple testing. All

statistical tests were two-sided and deemed statistically significant at the five percent level

(p<0.05). With the exception of joinpoint regression, performed using specific software, all

analyses were carried out using R (33).

Cumulative epidemiologic data supports a causal relationship between menopausal

hormone therapy (MHT) and breast cancer risk (34, 35). To determine the possible

proportion of women exposed, data from the Prescribing Information System in Scotland,

which includes all items dispensed in Scotland was obtained from eDRIS to determine the

number of MHT prescriptions and estimated proportions of prescriptions of women who

might be exposed from 1996-2016.

Results

C ha ra c t er is ti c s o f c oh o rt b y E R s ta tu s

Between 1997 and 2016, 72,217 women of 20 years of age or older were diagnosed with at

least one invasive breast cancer in Scotland (Table 1). Seventy six percent of these tumours

were ER+, 16% were ER- and 8% had unknown ER status. However, the percentage of

missing ER status decreased over time from 20% in 1997 to 2% in 2016. Proportions with

unknown ER status differed by region and age: was higher in the West compared to the

North and Southeast of Scotland and in women aged 70 years or older compared to women

aged less than 70 years (14% missing vs 5%). Almost half of breast cancers were diagnosed

among women of 50 to 69 years of age, the range for eligibility for routine breast cancer

screening.

Tumour characteristics differed by ER status, with ER- tumours having characteristics

associated with more advanced/aggressive disease. ER- tumours had higher grade, were

larger, more likely to have positive lymph node status and less likely to be screen detected

than ER+ tumours. The patterns of other molecular markers also differed by ER status, with

ER- tumours more likely to be PR- and HER2+ than ER+ tumours. In contrast, ER+ tumours

were more likely to be PR+ and HER2- than ER- tumours.

The combinations of ER/HER2 status Figure 1a show that among women with known

ER/HER2 status (N=27,580) most tumours were ER+/HER2-, with ER-/HER2+ tumours being

the least common combination. ER-/HER2- tumours, the most aggressive subtype, was the

second most common at 11%. Cross-sectional age specific curves for the ER/HER2

combinations (Figure 1b) show incidence of all subtypes increasing rapidly with age until the

approximate age of menopause, age 50 years, after which the increase continues more

gradually up to 70 years for ER+/HER2- tumours but did not increase further for ER- tumours

or ER+/HER2+ tumours.

As would be expected, increases in breast cancer incidence over time are less marked when

using worst tumour characteristics per person (so that subjects are only counted once)

rather than tumours as the numerator for incidence. Age-standardised incidence of ER+

tumours increased from 98 per 100,000 women in 1997 to 113 per 100,000 women in 2016

(Figure 2), with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 0.4% (95% CI: -0.1 to 1%).

Incidence of breast cancer was higher for ER+/HER2- tumours than for the rest of the

subtypes (Figure 2) and the time trend for incidence this subtype was similar to that of ER+

tumours with increases observed up to 2011. ER+/HER2+ and ER-/HER2+ tumour incidence

decreased over time and there appeared to be an increase ER-/HER2- tumour incidence

from 2011, although the latter finding was based on relatively small numbers.

Estimates from the joinpoint analysis (Table 2) show that the increase in incidence of ER+

tumours was reasonably constant (1.2% increase annually, 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.5%) from 1997

till around 2012 after which incidence dereased by approximately 2.2% annually (95% CI: -

4.7 to 0.4%). By contrast, ER- tumour incidence decreased consistently over the study

period by approximately 2.5% per year (95% CI: -3.9 to -1.1%). Joinpoint regression results

by age-group in Table 2 revealed that women of 50 to 69 years of age had the highest

increases in ER+ incidence at a similar period as noted overall (Figure 3a); followed by

women aged 20 to 49 years where ER+ tumour incidence increased by 1.1% annually. For

older women of 70 years or more rates were stable. The decreases observed in ER- tumours

were consistent across the three age groups (Figure 3b).

Additional joinpoint regression analysis by the ER/HER2 combinations of breast cancer

(Supplemental Table 1), revealed that ER+/HER2- and ER-/HER2+ breast cancer incidence

remained constant from 2009 to 2016. In contrast, ER+/HER2+ incidence decreased for all

women, and that decrease was predominantly among women aged more than 50 years old.

ER-/HER2- breast cancer incidence slightly increased from 2011 to 2016 and was most

marked among women aged 20 to 49 years.

Age-Period-Cohort models
Results from APC models were consistent with those observed from joinpoint regression,

with net drifts suggesting increases in the overall incidence of ER+ tumours by 0.8% per year

(95% CI: 0.6 to 1.0%/year) from 1997 to 2016, and ER- tumour incidence decreasing by 1.4%

(95% CI: -1.8 to -1.1%/year).

After adjusting for period and cohort effects, local drifts

showed that the highest increase in incidence of ER+ tumours was observed in women

around 70 years of age (2% per year, 95%CI: 1.6 to 2.4%) (Supplemental Figure 2a). The

greatest drop in incidence of ER- tumours was observed in women between 53 and 61 years

of age (Supplemental Figure 2b).

Compared to the women born in 1949, ER+ tumour incidence was higher among more

recent birth cohorts. In contrast, ER- incidence was lower for more recent birth cohorts

compared to the cohort born in 1949. Cohort rate ratios (CRRs) compared to women born in

1949 ranged from 0.7 for women born in 1913 to 1.8 for women born in 1985 for ER+

tumours and from 1.5 for women born in 1913 to 0.5 for women born in 1985 for ER-

tumours (Figure 4). The combination test for ER+ tumours revealed cohort effects beyond

the log-linear trend shown by the net drift (p value=

6.3  10ି଼

) but the test for ER- tumours

failed to reach significance (p value=0.14).

MHT use in Scotland
Supplemental Table 2 shows that MHT utilisation has changed dramatically since 2003 in

Scotland and use steadily declined following the results of the Women’s Health Initiative

trial indicating increased risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer among women

randomised to MHT (36). Data from the Prescribing Information System in Scotland, which

includes all items dispensed in Scotland, show that numbers of MHT-prescriptions and

estimated proportions of women who might be MHT-exposed at 40-79 years of age as high

as 16.5% in 1999 but as low as 4.7% by 2015.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that In Scotland, temporal trends of breast cancer incidence were

distinct by molecular subtypes, with increases for ER+ and decreases for ER- tumours

between 1997 and 2016. With respect to ER+ tumours, their incidence increased for all ages

for the study period but particularly among women of screening ages 50 to 69 years, with

the largest increases occurring from around 1997-2011 followed by modest declines. In

contrast, the incidence of ER- cancers decreased among all ages till the early 2000’s. Finally

we noted cohort effects such that in comparison to women born around 1950, women of

older generations (those born in the 1910s to 1940s) had a lower risk of ER+ tumours,

whereas there was no significant evidence for cohort effects for ER- tumours. Further

analysis of the incidence trends by subtype (as defined by ER/HER2 combinations) showed

similar results to those observed by ER status only. ER+/HER2- (surrogate for luminal A)

tumours followed the same pattern as ER+ tumours, and ER-/HER2- (surrogate for Triple

Negative) similar to ER- tumours.

Consistent with other reports from the United States, Denmark and Ireland (7-9), our data

show for the first time in a UK national cancer registry, contrasting temporal trends of

breast cancer incidence by ER status and suggest the presence of aetiologic heterogeneity

with distinct patterns by period, age at diagnosis and birth cohort. Previous studies have

shown estimated annual increases in the age-standardised rate of breast cancer from early

90’s to the 2010 for ER+ ranging from 0.1 to 3% and declines for ER- ranging from -1.9 to -

3.4% (7-9). The Scottish Cancer Registry’s detailed tumour hormone receptor data have

been used to describe trends in incidence patterns of breast cancer. Specifically, it was

previously reported that there were declines in ER positive tumours among women 50–64

years of age that was statistically significant by 2005 (12). These findings were attributed to

reduction in MHT use, which had been shown to be associated with increased risk of breast

cancer (34, 36). Unlike the previous analysis we excluded women with a previous

malignancy, imputed missing ER status, used individuals rather than tumours as the

numerator for incidence rates but the findings were similar for comparable years. The

declines in breast cancer incidence observed in Scottish data have been also shown in the

United States (7, 37-39), Sweden (8) and France (40). We observed consistent increases over

time for ER+ tumour incidence beyond 2002 after which MHT use declined. Based on recent

reports on the association of MHT use and breast cancer risk (35) MHT has been estimated

to contribute to 1 in 20 breast cancers diagnosed worldwide from 1990. In more recent

years when MHT use has declined in use, it has been estimated to have an approximate 5

year lag time to breast cancer incidence and contribute to 2.3% of breast cancers in

Scotland in recent years (41). Despite reductions in HRT use between 2005-2011 incidence

of breast cancer continued to increase. In addition to long-term effects of previous HRT use,

other factors, such as screening, obesity and alcohol consumption (41) are likely also to

contribute to time trends in breast cancer incidence.

Mammographic screening is likely to be an important contributing factor to the increased

incidence of ER+ tumours we observed from 1997-2011. In Scotland, the breast screening

programme was established in 1988 with full national coverage attained in 1991 (42).

Scotland’s breast screening programme was introduced earlier than in other countries that

have evaluated breast cancer incidence trends by ER status (ie. 2000 in Ireland and 2010 in

Denmark, in the US there are no national screening programmes). In Scotland, from 1994-

2003 women of 50-64 years of age were invited for screening, which was extended to

include women of 65 to 70 years of age in 2003. Over the course of the entire study period

in Scotland, the mammographic screening programme had around 75% uptake. Our data

showing ER+ tumours are more likely to be screen detected than ER- tumours (31% vs 17%)

and our APC model results showing incidence of ER+ tumours greatest for those of

screening ages between 65 and 72 years, suggest that some of the increases observed in

ER+ tumours is likely to be due to detection of prevalent disease in these older women. A

similar pattern was also observed in the previous report (12). In contrast, screening is

probably not a major contributor to the more recent declines in incidence that we observed

for ER+ tumours starting in 2011 among women aged 50 to 69 years. Some studies have

suggested that decreases in incidence may coincide with the saturation of the screening

programme (7, 38), however, given that uptake in Scotland remained approximately stable

for the whole study period with a slight fall (0.6%) for the last three-year period (42) this

seems unlikely to be a contributing factor.

Obesity prevalence and alcohol intake have increased over time, although declines for

alcohol in particular have been noted since 2003. Recent analysis estimates these two

factors account for 18% of all breast cancers diagnosed in Scotland (41). The relationships of

obesity and alcohol use are complicated and seem to be modified by menopausal status,

but previous analysis suggest increased alcohol use to be associated with increased risk of

ER+ tumours. Obesity in premenopausal women is particularly associated with a higher risk

of ER-negative compared with ER-positive cancer (43-45). Secular trends in increasing

obesity prevalence may contribute to the divergent trends in breast cancer incidence by ER

status observed in younger women. Our analysis although showing overall increases in

incidence for ER+ breast cancers for the entire study period, suggests for the first-time

incidence of ER+ tumours not rising or slightly declining, particularly for women aged 50 to

69 years of age that started around 2011. This recent decrease in ER+ tumours incidence

parallels results in Ireland showing incidence of ER+ tumours stabilizing or slightly

decreasing from 2008 to 2013 (9). From national survey data in Scotland, obesity prevalence

increased between 1995 and 2008 and then remained approximately stable until 2012 after

which there was some evidence of declines especially among the most affluent groups of

women (46). Future work is required to clarify the contribution of changes in obesity

prevalence to trends in incidence of breast cancer and the lag time in its contribution to

breast cancer incidence, including short and long term effects.

In addition to obesity, other factors seem to have a differential effect on risk of ER+ and ER-

tumours. For example, reproductive factors such as younger age at menarche, older age at

first birth, nulliparity, lack of breastfeeding and older age at menopause are associated with

an increased risk of ER+ breast cancers (3, 47). Parous women have an increased risk of

triple negative or basal-like tumours compared to nulliparous women (48-50). Breastfeeding

has been consistently associated with a reduced risk particularly more aggressive subtypes

of breast cancer, namely ER- (48) and triple negative tumours (47, 48). In Scotland,

reproductive patterns have changed considerably over time: the average age of a woman at

first birth has increased from 26 years in 1975 to 30.5 years in 2017, fertility rates have

decreased and the number and proportion of women not having children has also increased

in recent decades (51, 52). Our study provides evidence of changes in incidence of breast

cancer between birth cohorts by ER status with higher year of birth positively associated

with risk of ER+ breast cancer and inversely associated with risk of ER-. The reproductive

factor changes that have occurred in Scotland may be associated with the increasing ER+

breast cancer incidence in more recent birth cohorts. Breastfeeding practice at 6-8 weeks

has increased in Scotland from 36% in 2001 to 42% in 2018 (53), and this may have also

contributed to some of the declines observed for ER- tumours. Current, estimates suggest

5.2% of breast cancer attributable to not breastfeeding in Scotland (41).

The strengths of our study are the high quality of the longitudinal data collected within the

Scottish cancer registry, the first one in the UK and fifth in the world that routinely started

recording molecular marker data (ER status from 1997 and PR and HER2 status from 2009).

Marker data can be used to monitor and describe incidence trends in the future and for

other types of cancer that also display heterogeneity. Further, monitoring breast cancer

incidence by molecular subtypes can help the NHS allocate resources for treatment and

prevention and lead to the identification of high-risk groups of women for which to

implement future prevention programmes and treatments.

Limitations of our study include the absence of individual level risk factor data. However,

future studies should be possible to identify some key factors using linked data. Scotland is

renowned for its high-quality longitudinal data and ability to perform linkage studies using a

unique identifier. Hence, we envision future analysis using the Scottish cancer registry

linked to other datasets, including community prescription drug records, maternity records

and hospital records to provide more detailed information on the role of patterns of key risk

factors in breast cancer incidence trends. Another limitation of the study is the lack of

mRNA expression assays for the classification of the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. In

our study, markers measured by IHC are used as surrogates for the molecular subtypes,

which are reasonably good proxies but mRNA profiling data would be considered a gold-

standard for intrinsic-subtype classification (54).

In conclusion, incidence trends of breast cancer in Scotland differ by ER status and are

consistent with trends observed in other countries. Additional data are needed to establish

whether HER2+ tumours, which are ER-, remain low since trastuzumab is one of the costliest

breast cancer treatments used by the NHS. Further research should be focused on

monitoring incidence trends by subtype given notable risk and treatment differences for

breast cancer subtypes.
