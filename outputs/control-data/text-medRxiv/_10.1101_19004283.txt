ABSTRACT

AIM To conduct a systematic literature review on neuroimage findings in children with
microcephaly by Zika virus (ZIKV).
METHOD We performed a literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science

for full-text articles reporting neuroimage exam of computed tomography scan or magnetic
resonance imaging.
RESULTS Were identified 2,214 publications. Of these 2,170 were excluded by the analysis
of titles and abstracts, resulting in 7 articles included. The abnormalities presented in
neuroimage showed the highest occurrence in the first trimester: decreased brain volume +
increased extra-axial CSF space (100%), subcortical calcifications (89.1%), microcephaly
(89.1%), ventriculomegaly (72.9%), malformation of cortical development (40.5%), basal
ganglia calcifications (40.5%), megacisterna magna (39.1%). In relation to the second
trimester of ZIKV infection, the most common were as follows: decreased brain volume +
increased extra-axial CSF space (100%), subcortical calcifications (100%), microcephaly
(85.7%), ventriculomegaly (71.4%), malformation of cortical development (71.4%), basal
ganglia calcifications (19%), megacisterna magna (4.7%). In relation to the neuroimage
abnormalities detected in the 3rd trimester 2 cases were found.
INTERPRETATION This systematic review is the first that evaluates brain changes in
newborns with different neuroimage techniques (CT and MRI exams) and related findings
with the gestational period of ZIKV infection .

INTRODUCTION
Many original articles and case series have been published emphasizing neuroimage findings
on congenital ZIKV infection. The overwhelming majority of these studies do not follow a
neuroradiological methodology to describe the malformations and brain abnormalities
resulting from ZIKV infection, much less a cause-and-effect correlation between the
gestational period of maternal infection and the severity of encephalic changes at birth.
Neuroimage methods with different sensitivities and diagnostic accuracy have been
employed at random to elaborate tables and descriptive results of the main neuroradiological
changes present in the newborns with congenital ZIKV infection. The consequence of this is
the lack of a specific neuroradiological signature that relates to the gestational trimester of
fetal infection by ZIKV.
ZIKV is a flavivirus transmitted mainly by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. The virus was
first isolated in Uganda in 1947 and remained restricted to areas in Africa and Asia for sixty
years. In early 2015, in Brazil, however, there was an outbreak of ZIKV infection in the
northeast region of the country [1]. In October 2015, an increase in the number of cases of
microcephaly was reported, and this congenital malformation was related to intrauterine
ZIKV infection [2,3]. The most frequent symptoms of ZIKV are fever, myalgia and rash [4].
ZIKV is usually diagnosed by the set of symptoms and standard reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from blood, urine or saliva fluids. However, there are
some difficulties in the diagnosis due to possible cross-reaction with other flaviviruses [5]. In
relation to neuroimage findings, a variety of cortical malformations can be identified. They
include parenchymal volume reduction, alterations in the gyral pattern, as well in white and
gray matter, ventriculomegaly, abnormalities of the corpus callosum and cerebellum,
hypoplasia and / or atrophy of the brainstem and difuse calcifications [6]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) reported in 2016 cases of microcephaly and neurological disorders
associated to ZIKV as a public health emergency of international concern, intensifying the
need for further research in the area [7]. Microcephaly may not be evident at birth but may
develop after birth along with other brain abnormalities. Therefore, it is essential that infants
exposed to the ZIKV do perform neuroimage exams investigation. The objective of the
present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate radiological
findings and to create a neuroimage profile of children with microcephaly exposed to
intrauterine ZIKV infection regarding the time of intrauterine infection.

METHOD
This systematic review was performed following the methodology described in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviewers and presented by Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Review and Meta-analyzes: the PRISMA Statement [8]. The search protocol was
designed and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017058801).

Search strategy
We performed a literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science.
Following terms were used in the search strategy: “Zika virus”, “microcephaly”, “newborn”,
“pregnancy” and “neuroimage”.

Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria: we included prospective and retrospective clinical studies with neuroimage
exams: computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
individuals infected with ZIKV with microcephaly without language or year restriction until
march 2018.
Exclusion criteria: Preclinical studies, in vivo studies, letters to the editor, editorials,
duplicate publications, articles that do not have data to be evaluated, or articles that do not
address neuroimage (CT or MRI) were excluded.

Data extraction
The databases were searched and duplicate entries were removed. Abstracts that did not provide
sufficient information regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for full-text
evaluation. In the second phase, the same reviewers independently evaluated the full text of these
articles and made their selection in accordance with the eligibility criteria. Two reviewers (JM and

BBF) performed the literature search and study selection independently. Disagreements were
solved by consensus or by a third reviewer (GR).
Statistical analysis
To verify the statistically significant differences of the neuroradiological findings between
the cases of ZIKV infection in the first and second trimester of gestation, we performed a
Chi-squared-exact fisher test with a 95% confidence interval.

RESULTS
The initial database resulted in 2,214 articles. After the removal of duplicate files, 2,211
articles were filtered according to the inclusion criteria. Of these 2,170 were excluded by the
analysis of titles and abstracts, resulting in 41 articles for evaluation of the full text. 17
documents were excluded because there was no investigation with CT or MRI and 2 because
they were experimental studies, resulting in a total of 22 studies. Subsequently, 11 articles
were excluded because they were not a case report, and 4 were excluded because they did not
include the trimester of gestation that occurred the infection, totalizing 7 articles included [915]. The complete flowchart is shown in Figure 1.
Our review included 125 cases of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) reported in 7 studies
(Table 1). There was a predominance of cases described in the first trimester (n=74) when
compared to the second (n=21) and the third (n=2). There was a predominance of neuroimage
abnormalities in the first and second trimester as described in Table 2 and Fig 2. The most
frequent findings in the first and second trimester (1st and 2nd) were decreased brain volume +
increased extra-axial CSF space (100% and 100%), subcortical calcifications (89.1% and
100%), microcephaly (89.1% and 85.7), ventriculomegaly (72.9% and 71.4%)),
malformation of cortical development (40.5% and 71,4%), basal ganglia calcifications
(40.5% and 19%), megacisterna magna (39.1% and 4.7%). In the 3rd trimester, the first case,
the mother was infected in the 7th month of gestation, presenting cortical calcifications with
cortical volumetric reduction and in the second case, the infection occurred in the 8th month
of gestation and neuroimage showed subcortical calcifications, reduced cortical volume, and
colpocephaly.
Two outcomes had a score of p <0.05: Megacisterna magna (p = 0.002), showing a more
frequent symptom when contamination occurred in the first trimester and Malformation of
cortical development (p = 0.02), which was more recurrent in cases of contamination in the
second trimestrer (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
This systematic review is the first that evaluates brain changes in newborns with congenital
infection by ZIKV with distinct neuroimage methods (CT and MRI exams) and treied to
associated abnormalities with the gestational period of infection.
The studies published so far has described image abnormalities at random, without preestablished neuroradiological criteria, using imaging modalities with different sensitivity and
accuracy, which compromise a reliable and adequate statistical analysis. Another limitation
of the great majority of the published studies concerns the absence of the cause-effect
relationship, due to the non-description of the gestational period that the fetal infection
occurred. In addition, the present systematic review found numerous neuroimage findings
only describes numerous cerebral malformations with microcephaly and at no time evidence
the severity of the outcomes with the period of ZIKV infection. The main finding of this
systematic review was that this review showed that the most serious and prevalent alterations
occurred when the infection occurred in the first trimester of gestation. In contrast, it was
verified that infections occurred in the second and third trimester of gestation presented less
severe and complex radiological alterations (table 1).
Thus, because ZIKV interferes with the process of neuronal migration and consequent brain
formation, the most prevalent radiological alterations, both in the first and second trimester,
were subcortical calcifications, ventriculomegaly, microcephaly, cerebral volume decrease
and cortical development malformation. Regarding patients with infections in the third
trimester, only two cases of microcephaly were described and no additional malformations
were reported.
The possible relationship of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and the aforementioned CNS
changes gives rise to great concern for global public health, as this virus presently does not
have any effective treatment. The period of infection of the ZIKV and the occurrence of fetal
brain abnormalities that may be susceptible to viral pathogenesis, and how it affects the
appearance of brain abnormalities on imaging, are currently poorly understood.
Brain changes caused by infectious agents during pregnancy differ from those that occur in
children and adults because they occur during nervous tissue development. Manifestations of
these infections will differ depending on the time when they occur and are less related to the
virulence of the agent. Thus, in general, infections during the first two trimesters will result in
congenital malformations, while those occurring in the third trimester will result in
destructive lesions [16].

The ZIKV infection causes abnormalities during neural differentiation. Neural stem cells
(NSCs) represent a primary target for ZIKV infection. During the infection, ZIKV proteins
interfere in the NSC function causing severe consequences such as metabolic fluxes,
inhibition of cell proliferation, and cellular apoptosis [17]. Neurospheres generated from
human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) after 3 days of ZIKV infection showed a
morphological alteration and cell detachment, which can be associated mainly with cellular
migration processes. After 6 days of exposure to ZIKV, only few neurospheres survived to
the virus action. ZIKV can be observed in membranes, mitochondria and vesicles of cells.
Other alterations caused by ZIKV in neurospheres include apoptotic nuclei formation,
hallmark of cell death and presence of smooth membrane. The impact of ZIKV during
embryonic neurogenesis was showed by the exposition of ZIKV to cerebral organoids
derived from iPSC. The average growth area of the organoids exposed to the ZIKV was
reduced by 40% when compared to the control cerebral organoids. This result demonstrated
that ZIKV induces cell death in human iPS-derived neural stem cells, disrupts the formation
of neurospheres and reduces organoids growth, indicating that ZIKV infection in models that
mimics the first trimester of brain development may result in severe damage [18].
Similar studies showed that ZIKV infection can modulate cellular metabolism in neuronal
cells in the first stages of neurodifferentiation through P53 activation and mTOR pathway
inhibition by induction of early shifting from glycolysis to OXPHOS that produce immature
differentiation, apoptosis, and stem cell exhaustion [19, 20].
Another important contribution of the current systematic review, which may be of great value
to subsequent studies, is the discovery of numerous methodological or descriptive limitations
that may have distorted the prevalence or frequency of neuroradiological findings in
newborns with congenital ZIKV. One of the most important limitations was the absence of
neuroradiological criteria for the description of the brain abnormalities, which can be verified
by the absence of homogeneity of the findings, often using two descriptions for the same
neuroradiological finding. Another relevant limitation, which certainly modified the actual
frequency / prevalence of described neuroradiological abnormalities, was the equivalence
between ultrasonography (US), CT and MRI during the description and tabulation of the
results, without taking into account the disparity in sensitivity and accuracy between the three
methods of which resulted in high frequencies and a greater diversity of brain changes in
studies with higher number of MRIs and few changes / descriptions in those studies with few
MRI exams. The difficulties encountered in assessing the relationship between the gestational
age at which ZIKV infection occurred and the structural changes in the brain are associated

with a lack of laboratory evidence and recorded clinical information, imaging studies of
different sensitivities and/or reports with limited detail of the abnormalities and the
heterogeneity in the their description in some cases. Also, in some articles in addition, in
some reports there is no description of changes in the midline abnormalities such as changes
in the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis (perhaps due to the predominant number of CT
scans and low quality MRI) and no recognition of cerebral and cerebellar atrophy or
enlargement of cerebrospinal fluid space. Lastly, poor experience of the radiologist with
pediatric neuroimage, many of which were interpreted by non-radiologists or general
radiologists.
The number of studies available in the literature specifying radiological findings of
congenital ZIKV infection still scarce. The clinical and radiological peculiarities of this
pathology are in constant debate, as our review demonstrates. The necessity for a final
description and classification of ZIKV brain abnormalities, using appropriate neuroimage
criteria that allow a temporal cause-effect relationship with the gestational period of fetal
infection may be of great value in assessing the outcomes and prognoses of affected children.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best method for assessing the central nervous
system (CNS) of fetuses with suspected defects. The absence of ionizing radiation and the
ability for greater tissue differentiation allows for a better study of the CNS, without the
limitations caused by skull artifact or fetal position. Further MRI studies are required for a
more detailed and specific evaluation of the brain abnormalities caused by the congenital
ZIKV infection, studies that comprise a more homogenous design, with a higher number of
evaluated outcomes and that have two independent evaluators and trained to perform the
image exams.

CONCLUSION
Neuroimage abnormalities are much more prevalent and severe when the infection occurred
in the 1st, 2nd trimester in comparison to the 3rd. Findings that might characterized
/differentiate infections that occurred in the first trimester in comparison to the second are
malformation of cortical development and megacisterna magna.
