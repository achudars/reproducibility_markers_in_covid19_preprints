ABSTRACT
Objective To investigate characteristics and risk factors of a novel parenchymal lung disease,
increasingly detected in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA).
Methods In a multi-center retrospective study, 61 cases were investigated, using physicianreported clinical information and centralized analyses of radiologic, pathologic and genetic data.
Results Lung disease (LD) was associated with distinctive features, including acute erythematous
clubbing and a high frequency of anaphylactic reactions to the IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab. Serum
ferritin elevation and/or significant lymphopenia preceded LD detection. The most prevalent
chest CT pattern was septal thickening, involving the periphery of multiple lobes +/- ground glass
opacities. Predominant pathology (23/36) was pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and/or
endogenous lipoid pneumonia (PAP/ELP), with atypical features, including regional involvement
and concomitant vascular changes. Apparent severe delayed drug hypersensitivity occurred in
some cases. 5-year survival was 42%. Whole-exome sequencing (20/61) did not identify a novel
monogenic defect PAP-related or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)-related mutations as
likely primary cause. Trisomy 21 (T21) increased LD risk, as did young sJIA onset. Refractory sJIA
was not required for LD development. Exposure to interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibitors (46/61)
was associated with multiple LD features. By several indicators, severity of sJIA was comparable
in drug-exposed subjects and published sJIA cohorts. MAS at sJIA onset was increased in the drugexposed, but it was not associated with LD features.
Conclusions A rare, life-threatening LD in sJIA is defined by a constellation of unusual clinical
characteristics. The pathology, a PAP/ELP variant, suggests macrophage dysfunction. Inhibitor
exposure may promote LD, independent of sJIA severity, in a small subset of treated patients.
Treatment/prevention strategies are needed.

INTRODUCTION
Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of childhood,
observed worldwide, with an incidence of 0.4-0.9/100,000 in North America and Europe.[1] A
similar disease occurs in adults [adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD); incidence (0.20.4/100,000)].[2] sJIA is characterized by a combination of arthritis, which can be destructive,
and systemic inflammation, including daily fever spikes, evanescent macular rash, and serositis.
A life-threatening complication (mortality rate: 8-17% in sJIA)[3] is overt macrophage activation
syndrome (MAS). MAS is a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) that
manifests as a cytokine storm, with very high serum ferritin and, in severe cases, organ failure.
Therapies that antagonize cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 were introduced into management of sJIA ~15
years ago. This approach is rapidly effective in >65% patients, implicating these inflammatory
mediators as key drivers of sJIA.[4-6]
The usual pulmonary complications of sJIA are pleuritis and pleural effusion.[1,7] Scattered case
reports of other lung diseases in sJIA have appeared.[8-12] However, in the last decade, pediatric
rheumatologists have increasingly detected cases with types of lung diseases seen only rarely in
sJIA previously. Kimura et al described 25 cases that occurred before February 2011; diagnoses
included pulmonary arterial hypertension (64%), interstitial lung disease (28%), and pulmonary
alveolar proteinosis (20%). sJIA course was considered severe, with MAS in 80%.[13]
Here, we performed a multi-center, retrospective study of 61 cases, with centralized analyses of
radiographic, pathologic and genetic data to provide a current characterization of lung disease in
sJIA or sJIA-like disease, search for early indicators and investigate risk factors.
METHODS
Case definition and comparators
We used an operational sJIA case definition, developed by expert consensus as a modification of
the ILAR (International League of Associations for Rheumatology) sJIA classification criteria.[14]
Cases failing to meet the case definition, but managed clinically like sJIA, were classified as sJIAlike. We identified patients with sJIA or sJIA-like disease and parenchymal lung disease (LD)
through the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) network and the
international pediatric rheumatology listserv (administered by McMaster University, Ontario).
Inclusion required verification of sJIA or sJIA-like illness, data at LD diagnosis, and parenchymal
LD by chest CT and/or lung tissue, available for expert review. Comparator data were from
physician-classified sJIA patients without known LD, enrolled in the CARRA registry (CR)[15]
between 2015-2018, or in the PharmaChild pharmacovigilance registry.[16] See figures S1A-B,
S2 and online supplementary information for additional details.
Data collection
Institutional Review Board permission was obtained at each institution according to local
requirements. Data included demographics, medical history, clinical features at sJIA onset, at LD
diagnosis, and at defined time points (visits) before and after LD diagnosis. RegiSCAR score for
drug related eosinophilic systemic syndrome (DReSS) was calculated from clinical data.[17]
Online supplementary information includes details and definitions (table S1).

Data analysis
Centralized analyses were performed for chest CT scans from 58/61 subjects, histopathology
from 36/61 subjects and whole exome sequence (WES) data from 20 subjects. R program,
version 3.5.1, was used for all statistical analyses. Additional methods are in online
supplementary information.
RESULTS
Disease characterization: features unusual for sJIA
The cohort included 45 cases of sJIA and 16 cases of sJIA-like disease; findings prior to or
associated with LD did not differ systematically between these two groups (tables S2-4).
Demographics of the LD cohort are mostly similar to sJIA subjects in the CARRA registry (CR), with
the notable exceptions of significantly lower median age at sJIA onset and significantly higher
prevalence of trisomy 21 (table 1). These findings are discussed further below (Risk factors).

Clinical features prior to LD and associated with LD are summarized on tables S2 and S3,
respectively. At LD diagnosis, respiratory signs and symptoms were typically absent or subtle,
although hypoxia was reported in 43% and clinical pulmonary hypertension (PH) in 30%.
Strikingly, 61% of patients developed acute clubbing, sometimes as the first indicator of LD. In
over half of these, digital erythema occurred (figure 1A-C). Other atypical features were pruritic,

non-evanescent rashes in 56% (figure 1D-F), eosinophilia in 37%, unexplained, severe abdominal
pain in 16% (likely underestimated as this was not directly queried). Anaphylaxis to tocilizumab
was unusually common, occurring in 38% of those exposed (14/37), compared to 0.6% (1/159) in
the CR, 0.9% (1/110) in the tocilizumab trial in sJIA.[5a]. In one study, severe tocilizumab
reactions occurred in 3/11 young (<2 years old) active sJIA patients, without known lung disease
[5b]; however, in the LD cohort, the median age at reactions was 4.15 years (IQR:2.58y-6.04y).
Overall, the LD cohort manifested clinical features that are unusual for sJIA [18] or pulmonary
disease.
Candidate early indicators of lung disease in sJIA: ferritin and lymphopenia
Median time to LD diagnosis after sJIA onset was 1.6 years (IQR 0.8y-3.3y), excluding 6/61 cases
with LD at systemic disease onset. To identify candidate early signs of lung disease, we analyzed
laboratory values commonly followed in sJIA. We matched cases to sJIA controls from the CR
(1:1) for factors including laboratory test timing relative to sJIA onset, overall drug exposure, sex,
sJIA onset age (figure S3). We then assessed serum ferritin as an indicator of inflammation. Mean
serum ferritin level in cases one year prior to LD diagnosis was not distinguishable from that of
propensity matched sJIA patients in the CR. However, the level rose substantially within the 12
months before LD diagnosis in the cohort (figure 1G, figure S4).
Another finding that preceded LD detection was significant lymphopenia [absolute lymphocyte
count (ALC) <60% of age-adjusted, lower limit of normal].[19] This degree of lymphopenia,
without concurrent MAS, was documented between the 6 month and 1 month visit prior to LD
diagnosis in 42% of cases (excluding those with LD at sJIA onset; table S3). We were unable to
compare this to CR controls due to lack of information. However, this degree of lymphopenia is
not a known feature of active sJIA.[18] Increased ferritin and lymphopenia before LD diagnosis
suggest a possibly extended incubation phase associated with smoldering inflammation and/or
delayed recognition of lung disease.
Radiologic features
As a step towards determining the nature of the LD, chest CT scans from 58/61 patients, most
obtained at diagnosis, were systematically reviewed (RPG). Most exhibited one or more of 5
patterns (figure 2A-E). Pattern A (septal thickening involving the periphery of multiple lobes,
most marked in the lower lung zones, parahilar/paramediastinal and/or anterior upper lobes
with or without adjacent ground-glass opacities) was the most frequently observed (60%). Crazypaving (B), peripheral consolidation (C), peribronchovascular consolidation (D), and
predominantly ground-glass opacities (E) were seen in 21%, 22%, 16%, and 12% respectively.
Among those with contrast-enhanced CTs, 11/30 (37%) displayed hyper-enhancing lymph nodes
(figure 2F), a peculiar finding, previously reported in unusual conditions.[20,21] Findings like
pattern A have been observed with connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated interstitial lung
disease or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features.[22]. However, unlike these
disorders, radiologic signs of fibrosis (honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis) were uncommon
in our cohort. Overall, the observed CT findings are unexpected in sJIA; the more typical finding
of pleural effusion[1,7,18] was rare at LD diagnosis (table S4).

Histopathology and related genetics
Biopsy or autopsy tissues of 36/61 patients were available for centralized analysis (GD). Multicompartment disease (some combination of alveolar, airway, pleural, vascular alterations) was
observed in all cases. Using their primary pattern of injury, 3 subgroups were defined: spectrum
of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis/endogenous lipoid pneumonia (PAP/ELP), vasculopathy and
other (table S4). The pathology typically associated with Pattern A on CT is nonspecific interstitial
pneumonia (NSIP).[22,23] Surprisingly, in 21 patients with CT Pattern A who had histology, only
1 had NSIP. Instead, the predominant pathology (64% of cases reviewed) was PAP/ELP (figure
2G), which was patchy, and often accompanied by associated vascular changes (figure 2G, right).
PAP/ELP is very rare in rheumatic disease,[24] and the CT pattern typically associated with PAP is
crazy paving (Pattern B).[25]
To identify other histologic features associated with PAP/ELP-like pathology in our cases, we
generated a heat map (figure S5A). Not surprisingly, type II alveolar cell hyperplasia was highly
associated with PAP/ELP.[26,27] The next associated finding was lymphoplasmacytic
inflammation (71% of PAP/ELP cases). Third, (55%) was mild to moderate pulmonary arterial wall
thickening. Hypertensive vascular changes are not typically associated with inherited PAP/ELP,
suggesting a secondary disease process.[26-28] Electron microscopy (available in 9 PAP/ELP
cases) demonstrated well-formed lamellar bodies within type II alveolar epithelial cells. Variable
accumulation of macrophages containing lamellar debris, lipid and cholesterol clefts was
observed (figure 2H). The EM findings are more characteristic of macrophage overloading or
dysfunction than of genetic disorders in surfactant metabolism.[29,30] When we examined 13
PAP/ELP cases (6 with EM analysis) for genes causing hereditary PAP [SFTPA1, SFTPB, SFTPC,
ABCA3, NKX2-1, CSF2RA, CSFR2B, MARS],[26,28,31-35] 6 were heterozygous for protein-changing
mutations, but none was de novo in trio analyses (table S5A). One (SFPTC p.R167Q) causes PAP
with low penetrance;[31] the others are not known to cause PAP in heterozygotes. While these
rare variants (maximum allele frequency <5%) might contribute to LD in these children, they are
not likely the full explanation.[32,36, 37]
Vascular abnormalities were the predominant finding in 4/36 biopsies (figure S5B-D, table S4).
Consistent with chest CT findings, interstitial fibrosis was generally mild, with advanced
fibrosis/remodeling in only 4/36 samples, including 2 autopsies (figure S5D).
Candidate risk factors for parenchymal lung disease
Other genetic factors
No evidence for a shared monogenic explanation for LD was found in WES of 20 cases analyzed
(not shown). We also assessed the frequency of HLH/MAS-related gene variants (PRF1, LYST,
STX11, STXBP2, UNC13D, NRLC4). Rare protein-altering variants, all heterozygous and none de
novo, were found (table S5B). Concordance between these variants and MAS (at sJIA onset or
ever during disease course to data close) was not observed. The frequency of such variants (55%)
is higher than reported for sJIA with MAS (36%)[38] and could contribute to propensity for
inflammation.
Early onset sJIA

Compared to control sJIA subjects in the CR, the LD cohort’s median age at sJIA onset was
substantially younger (table 1: 2.3y [1.1-5.0] vs. 5.2y [2.8-9.8] p=1x10-7; figure S6A). The CR
cohort showed the full age of onset range of published sJIA cohorts, whereas the LD cohort was
similar to a subgroup with younger onset age in sJIA cohorts[39,40] (figure S6B). Within LD cases,
early onset of sJIA/sJIA-like disease was tightly correlated with PAP/ELP-like pathology
(Wilcoxson test, p= 2.3e-4; if cut-off for age at sJIA onset <5y, OR = 15, Fisher p=0.001, compared
to older children in the cohort). 91% of cases (21/23) with PAP/ELP had sJIA onset at <5y (figure
S6C).
Trisomy 21
In the LD cohort, T21 prevalence (table 1) was strikingly higher (10%) than in sJIA registry cohorts
[0.2%: 1/471 in the CR and 2/914 in PharmaChild, these being similar to the frequency (0.14%) in
live births.[41] There were suggestions of more aggressive LD in these children, all of whom
developed LD on anti-IL-1/IL-6. 4/6 children with T21 were hypoxic (OR=7.8, Fisher p=0.08,
compared to the proportion of non-T21 with hypoxia). 2/5 with T21 showed advanced interstitial
fibrosis/remodeling (OR=8.4, Fisher p=0.09), and 2/4 children with advanced fibrosis had T21.
5/6 (83%) had viral or fungal lung infection at LD diagnosis, compared to 16/55 (29%) of non-T21
(OR=12, Fisher p=0.02)
Pre-exposure to cytokine inhibitors
Compared to previously described sJIA patients,[18] the LD cohort demonstrated rare clinical,
radiologic and pathologic findings. During the time period of the series, the annual number of
cases in the LD cohort increased dramatically, although some bias of ascertainment is possible
due to increased awareness of this disease (figure 3A). PAP/ELP pathology increased among
biopsied cases (figure 3B). The proportion of cases exposed to IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors increased in
the cohort (figure 3C) and in all reported lung disease cases in sJIA (figure S7). These 3 trends
coincided with increased use of IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors for sJIA.[42] Thus, we asked whether exposure
to these inhibitors was related to the prevalence of unusual features. The frequencies of acute
clubbing, digital erythema, unexplained abdominal pain, peripheral eosinophilia, CT Pattern A or
D, hyper-enhancing lymph nodes and PAP/ELP pathology, but not PH, were substantially higher
(p<0.1; FDR<20%) in pre-exposed (exposed before LD diagnosis) versus non-pre-exposed subjects
(figure 4A-B). Median time from inhibitor start to LD diagnosis was 1.2 years (IQR 0.7-2.0y, n=46).
Severe or refractory sJIA
It was possible that the observed association between drug exposure and unusual features was
attributable to a more inflamed sJIA course in those who develop LD (termed “channel bias”). To
investigate this possibility, we assessed 5 clinical features associated with sJIA severity, as there
is no validated sJIA severity index. For increased severity, we assessed MAS at sJIA onset, need
for calcineurin inhibitors, and persistent arthritis; for reduced severity, we assessed “ever off”
steroids and positive treatment response. The small sample of non-exposed subjects prevented
us from performing a full analysis within our cohort. We compared the pre-exposed LD subgroup
to published cohorts (figure 4C-F; table S6). In Russo et al.[43], the proportion of early sJIA onset
children (<1.5 years) with MAS at sJIA onset was 10x higher than the proportion of later sJIA onset
(>1.5 years) children (32% vs. 3%). This difference was interpreted to indicate more severe

inflammation in early onset sJIA. Among pre-exposed, early-onset sJIA, LD subjects, the
proportion with MAS at onset (27%) was comparable to early-onset subjects in Russo et al.[43].
For pre-exposed, later-onset sJIA LD children, a significantly higher proportion had MAS at onset
versus the comparable group in Russo et al.[43] (26% vs 3%; OR=12.75 p=0.0004) and versus
another sJIA cohort, Behrens et al.[44] (OR=4.83, p=0.003). These observations raised the
possibility that LD was associated with MAS at onset, rather than exposure to the inhibitors.
Arguing against this possibility, there was no association in the LD cohort between MAS at onset
and any of the unusual features (figure 4G). Thus, the associations between exposure to anti-IL1/IL-6 and the unusual features are unlikely to be confounded by higher frequency of MAS at sJIA
onset.
The pre-exposed LD cohort was generally similar to published cohorts for frequency of
treatment-responsive disease [lack of calcineurin inhibitor, a period of systemic quiescence or
substantially reduced steroid treatment; figure 4C-F]. One exception was that a lower proportion
of the LD subgroup treated with inhibitors for ³6 months was ever off steroids; nonetheless, this
proportion was >50% (figure 4F). In addition, at data close, 58% of the pre-exposed (18/31)
reported inactive sJIA (on medication) despite continuing LD in 94% (17/18). These observations
argue that refractory sJIA is not required for LD development or persistence.
Survival
The period of follow-up after LD diagnosis was variable (median 1.7 yrs; IQR 0.75-3 yrs). Survival
was drastically lower in the LD cohort (mortality: 159/1000 person-years; figure 5) than in a UK
cohort of sJIA patients who required biologic agents (mortality: 3.9/1000 person-years)[45]. The
predominant cause of death in our cohort was reported as diffuse lung disease (12/22 deaths),
with MAS in 5/12 (table S7). Among 75 categorical variables (table S2-S5), male sex, hypoxia at
initial LD evaluation, predominantly neutrophilic BAL (³40% neutrophils, over
10x>normal)[46,47], but not PH, appeared to associate with shortened survival (figure S8A-D).
These associations were not significant after adjusting for multiple tests. However, BAL
neutrophilia (³50%) has been linked to fatality,[48,49] and 100% in our series (12/12) with this
feature were deceased by data close.
DISCUSSION
LD in sJIA was characterized by young age at sJIA onset and unusual clinical features, including
acute erythematous clubbing, atypical rash, and anaphylaxis to tocilizumab; severe tocilizumab
reaction in sJIA with pulmonary disease was also noted in data from the PharmaChild registry[50].
The most prevalent finding on chest CT was peripheral septal thickening +/- ground glass
opacities. Consolidation, and hyper-enhancing lymph nodes were also observed. On tissue
diagnosis, this group showed primarily PAP/ELP-like pathology. Compared to PAP/ELP in other
settings, the LD pathology was distinctive for its patchiness and associated vascular changes.
The proportion of LD cases with PAP/ELP-like tissue diagnosis has increased since 2010,
coinciding with increasing use of IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors.[42] Pre-exposure to these inhibitors was
characteristic of the predominant phenotypic subtype in our series. It is possible that this
association is confounded by concomitant reduction in steroids with inhibitor use or by

treatment of severe inflammation; our data do not conclusively rule out these possibilities.
However, severe disease has been observed since the initial description of sJIA in 1897,[51]
whereas the LD with associated features described here appears to be new and increasing in
frequency (see below). Among biopsied cases, PAP/ELP was found in 80% with pre-exposure
(includes one with mostly pleural sample and limited PAP foci) vs. 36% not pre-exposed (OR=7,
(95% CI:1.45-33,7), Fisher p=0.015; figure S5E) and was independent of PAP/ELP association with
young age (figure S9). Thus, IL-1/IL-6 inhibitor exposure may be associated with development of
PAP/ELP-like disease in a subset (apparently small) of sJIA patients, among the substantially larger
group of patients who derive striking benefit from these inhibitors.
Autopsy RNA sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project show the lung
is a major physiologic producer of IL-1 and IL-6 in adults (figure S10),[52] and cytokine profiling
suggests that circulating IL-1RA levels (reflecting the IL-1 activity) in young (<4y) healthy children
are 2x higher than in older healthy children.[53] In addition, NFkB, a key transcription factor
downstream of IL-1, stimulates angiogenesis and alveolarization in the post-natal, developing
lung.[54] These observations raise the possibility of a physiologic role of IL-1/IL-6 in the lung,
particularly in early childhood. The striking enhancement of LD risk by early age of sJIA onset
suggests developmental vulnerabilities that may interact with the inhibitors.
A specific relationship between reduced IL-1 and PAP development is described in mice. IL-1a-/mice (but not IL-1b-/- mice) challenged with inhaled silicone, an inflammasome (NLRP3)
activator,[55] develop PAP-like lung disease.[56] In the lung, IL-1 regulates GM-CSF levels[57,58]
and macrophage function;[56,57] disruption of either can lead to surfactant accumulation and
PAP.[59,60] These findings imply a link between reduced IL-1 and PAP, but also suggest that
additional triggers may be required for disease development, in line with the rarity of severe
parenchymal LD among the overall population of sJIA patients treated with inhibitors.
We found an outsized risk of LD in children with T21 and sJIA. T21 carries increased susceptibility
to adverse drug reactions[61] and to viral pneumonia.[62] Another contributing factor may be
underlying type 1 interferonopathy, recently described in T21.[63]
A subset of LD cases met criteria for DReSS, a delayed form of severe drug-related
hypersensitivity with organ involvement that can include lung [17,64,65](table S8). DReSS
findings included dramatic eosinophilia, often despite concurrent steroids, together with
extensive, persistent rash, frequently involving the face, which is uncommon in sJIA.[18] Altered
drug metabolism in childhood may increase risk of hypersensitivity reactions.[66]. Another
consideration is drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DiILD), previously reported in children
with rheumatic disease on biologics.[67] DiILD has overlapping chest CT findings with LD in
sJIA.[68] No pathologic findings are pathognomonic of DiILD, [68,69] but PAP has been
described.[24]
Infection may exacerbate LD and may trigger its detection. Pathogens identified at initial lung
evaluation (table S3) included rhinovirus (a cause of severe lower respiratory infection in young
children[70]), herpes viruses and pneumocystis, all of which require IL-1 for optimal host

defense.[55,71,72] Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a recognized cause of PAP[25] and is
associated with high mortality in immunocompromised individuals.[73] PCP risk is also elevated
in DReSS.[74] At least 4 of our cases had PCP; these were diagnosed by PCR of BAL, the preferred
test in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients.[73] It seems prudent to consider prophylaxis for
sJIA patients with lymphopenia or steroid use (consistent with recommendations[75]) or T21.
In 23/61 cases, LD detection occurred with concurrent MAS. 19/61 had their first MAS episode
at or after LD diagnosis, suggesting that LD may trigger systemic inflammation. Pulmonary
hypertension (PH) with a range of severity was observed, with or without pre-exposure to
inhibitors and with or without PAP/ELP pathology. 2/20 subjects lacked substantial parenchymal
lung disease at PH detection. Together, these observations argue that PH in this cohort reflects
heterogenous biology.
Over 50 additional LD cases in sJIA have been reported to us since closing this series. The FDA
adverse event website (FAERS) shows 39 adults [rheumatoid arthritis (23); AOSD (11); other (5)]
developing alveolar disease or PH on IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors and 4 DRESS cases (second quarter,
2019). The associations between cytokine inhibition and LD in sJIA and the mechanistic
hypotheses regarding these observations demand further investigation. Importantly, we
acknowledge the limitations of retrospective data, use of historical/published data for controls,
possible biases as mentioned, and false discovery issues associated with multiple hypothesis
testing and exploration of data in a large data set. With these limitations, one cannot assign
causality to cytokine inhibition in LD in sJIA.
Likewise, it is premature to make treatment recommendations solely on the basis of our findings.
Therapeutic decision making is challenging in the setting of sJIA-associated LD, particularly given
the efficacy of the inhibitors in sJIA/sJIA-like disease [4-6]. Management strategies should
continue to be devised on an individual basis for these patients. However, in light of the high
fatality with current treatment approaches, efforts to determine lung disease prevalence,
uncover molecular mechanism(s) and devise treatment and prevention approaches are urgently
needed.

Figure 2: Distinctive radiologic and pathologic features
Panels A-E: Representative axial chest CT images: A. Multilobar, predominantly peripheral septal
thickening, most marked in the lower lung, parahilar and/or anterior upper lobes with or without
adjacent ground glass opacities. B. Crazy-paving C. Peripheral consolidations. D.
Peribronchovascular consolidations. E. Predominantly ground-glass opacities. F. Hyperenhancing lymph nodes on contrast-enhanced CT. Panels G-H: Histopathologic findings
(hematoxylin & eosin staining) along the pulmonary alveolar proteinosis/endogenous lipoid
pneumonia (PAP/ELP) spectrum. Alveolar filling with eosinophilic proteinaceous material (figure
2G left), admixed with a variable degree of ELP, indicated by cholesterol clefts (arrowheads) and
foamy (lipid-containing) macrophages (figure 2G middle and right), as described.[76,77] Regions
of PAP/ELP accompanied by type II alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia (figure 2G, right insert,
arrow), mild to moderate interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells and lobular remodeling
(airspace widening with increased interstitial smooth muscle). Typically, PAP/ELP findings were
patchy, with involved areas juxtaposed to normal lung (figure 2G, left, arrow). Figure 2G, right
shows pulmonary arterial wall thickening; a=artery. In A-G, # cases with pattern/# assessable
cases are indicated. H. Electron micrograph showing normal lamellar bodies within type II cells
(arrows) and macrophage (center), containing lamellar debris, lipid (*) and cholesterol clefts
(arrowhead). Original magnification x 7000. 4 PAP/ELP cases (1 each: ABCA3, CSF2RB variant),
stained for surfactant proteins (SP-B, proSP-C, SP-D, ABCA-3, TTF-1), demonstrated robust
immunoreactivity (not shown).
