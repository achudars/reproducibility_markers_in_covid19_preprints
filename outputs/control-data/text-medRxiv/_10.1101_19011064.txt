Background

26

Nearly two hundred eighty million children in low and middle income countries are at risk for

27

not achieving their full developmental potential(1). Poor development can lead to reduced

28

scholastic ability(2) or opportunity (promoting and entrenching inequity), and has been

29

associated with lower adult earning potential(3), and poorer health(4), thus potentially

30

contributing to intergenerational poverty traps.

31

While the entire period of childhood is important for development, the first 1000 days

32

(conception to age 2) are critically important for brain development; with the most rapid and

33

prolific development of neural pathways, first in sensory development, then language skills and

34

then higher cognitive functioning(5). Experiences during this period – positive or negative – can

35

substantially impact the architecture of the developing brain. Adverse events such as exposure to

36

familial or societal violence, toxins such as lead or arsenic, illness (anemia, diarrhea, HIV,

37

chronic malnutrition, maternal depression), or lack of a developmentally stimulating and

38

nurturing environment can all act as toxic stressors on young children that negatively impact

39

cognitive development throughout the life-course(6). Infants and young children in settings of

40

poverty are often faced with many of these stressors(7).

41
42

Some of these factors, if identified early enough, are potentially modifiable through intervention,

43

such as caregiver interaction and stimulation(8, 9), or treatment for or prevention of

44

malnutrition(3, 10). System and policy changes can influence access to health care for prevention

45

and treatment of illness, malnutrition, early marriage and first birth, and maternal education, all

46

of which may influence children’s development. However, an assessment of context-specific

47

risks is necessary to develop interventions that improve child development in specific settings.

48

Madagascar is one of the poorest nations in the world, with 75.1% of the population living on

49

less than $1.90 USD in 2018. It has very high rates of developmental risk (both as measured

50

through direct assessment in household surveys and indirectly through rates of stunting) and of

51

many possibly modifiable risk factors. In surveys from 2012 (most recent estimates to date), an

52

estimated 32% of children ages 3-5 years were considered developmentally at risk, 8.5%

53

received developmental stimulation from an adult and 47% of children under age 5 were stunted

54

(11, 12); the fifth highest prevalence of stunting in the world. In early 2017, to address the

55

burden of stunting and attendant neurodevelopmental delay, Madagascar unveiled their third

56

National Nutrition Action Plan (PNAN III), a multisector proposal co-funded by the World Bank

57

that aims to reduce stunting in Madagascar from 47.3% to 38% by 2021. The PNAN III plan

58

includes system improvements to deliver nutritional and health services in 8 regions of high

59

stunting; with support for other sectors, such as water, sanitation and hygiene, and climate-smart

60

agriculture (13). However, minimal information exists from these regions about the baseline

61

burden of risk or determinants for developmental delay in children, which could help inform the

62

implementation of PNAM-III and other health system strengthening interventions.

63

In 2014, the nongovernmental health organization, PIVOT, began operations in partnership with

64

the Ministry of Health to establish Ifanadiana District, in Southeastern Madagascar, as a model

65

health system. The effort aimed to strengthen the public health system through improvements in

66

facility readiness, clinical programs, and integrated data systems at all levels of care. That year,

67

we initiated the Ifanadiana Health Outcomes and Prosperity longitudinal Evaluation (IHOPE), a

68

representative cohort of Ifanadiana District to baseline health and socio-economic status of the

69

population and monitor the impact of the health intervention on the population over time. Here,

70

we use data from the 2016 wave of the IHOPE cohort at the time of the initiation of PNAN-III to

71

quantify the burden of risk for developmental delay in children ages 3 to 5 years in Ifanadiana

72

District, and to determine potentially modifiable risk factors that could inform local program

73

development.

74
75

Methods

76

Study population

77

Our study population is based in Ifanadiana District, with a population of approximately 209,000

78

residents. Ifanadiana is a low-resource setting in a low-resource country. Approximately 85% of

79

the population subsist from agriculture, 3% have access to improved latrines and only 20% have

80

access to safe drinking water. Health indicators are low compared with Madagascar as a

81

whole—in 2014, 34% of children had all appropriate vaccines by the time they were 23 months

82

old (vs. 51% for Madagascar); under 5 mortality was estimated at 145/1000 live births (vs.

83

62/1000 for Madagascar); and 20% of mothers had trained assistance in delivering their last baby

84

(vs. 59% for Madagascar). Children’s development in the district is similarly low compared to

85

the country as a whole. Four percent of children ages 3 or 4 were attending preschool (vs. 7.7%

86

nationally) and 27% of adults between ages 18-35 had no formal education (vs. 21% nationally)

Data collection

89

The IHOPE cohort was established as an extension of a representative baseline survey from

90

2014, which occurred at the outset of the health system strengthening intervention. The survey

91

(14) used a 2-stage random sample in 80 clusters to select 1600 households. The IHOPE study

92

revisits the same households every second year to collect data on health and economic indicators,

93

and it is stratified to be representative of both within and outside the initial PIVOT catchment

94

area (15). The IHOPE study uses methods, techniques and questionnaires based primarily on

95

Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), with additional questions from the Multiple Indicator

96

Cluster Surveys (MICS), and the Rwanda Questionnaire on Well-being (16). Specifically, we

97

used the early child development index (ECDI) modules from the MICS 4. The ECDI is

98

designed to be an internationally comparable population screener for developmental risk(17, 18)

99

(as opposed to a diagnostic tool for developmental delay), which includes questions about

100

development of 3 and 4 year olds, including risk and protective factors. Specific questions

101

include whether adults interact with the child in developmentally supportive ways (reading,

102

counting or naming things, singing to the child, playing with the child, taking the child out of the

103

home compound) (See Table 1 for specific questions in the ECDI). The ECDI focuses on 4

104

domains—learning, physical growth, social-emotional and literacy/numeracy. The IHOPE

105

surveys are implemented and conducted by the Madagascar Institute of Statistics (INSTAT), the

106

same organization that conducts the DHS and MICS in Madagascar.

107

Definitions

108

Outcomes

109

We defined development outcomes in 2 ways; one to compare to external cohorts in other

110

countries, and one to consider risks to development in children within the cohort relative to one

111

another. For external comparisons, we used the standard definitions from the MICS. Using these

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011064; this version posted November 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

112

definitions, a child was considered to be developmentally “on track” if the child had a positive

113

score in three of four domains in the ECDI, and “at risk for delay” if positive scores in fewer

114

than 3 domains. For internal comparisons, a child was considered to have “low development

115

relative to peers” if the ECDI score was at least 1 standard deviation (SD) below the IHOPE

116

sample mean.

117

Stimulation indicators

118

We used the standard definitions in the MICS to create our stimulation indicators. A variable for

119

“adult involvement” was created as a continuous score of number of reported developmentally

120

stimulating activities conducted with a child by any adult (mother, father or other adult). We also

121

created a binary variable for involvement—“adult disengagement” if no adult did at least 4

122

learning activities with the child in the last 3 days, and maternal, paternal and “other adult”

123

disengagement to assess differences between caregivers. Home environment was assessed with a

124

series of specific questions about number and source of playthings, number of books in the

125

house, and whether and how long the child was left alone or with another child under the age of

126

10 years as a caregiver (Figure 1).

127

Other Child-level measures

128

Nutritional status was assessed using the World Health Organization measures(19); both

129

continuous weight-for-age (underweight), weight-for-height (wasting) and height-for-age

130

(stunting) age-adjusted z scores compared to a normed international population, and binary

131

variables to characterize moderate and severe stunting, wasting and underweight status.

132

Other household-level measures

133

The number of other children under age 5 in the house was assessed as a continuous variable. A

134

binary variable was created for maternal education—any years of formal education vs. no formal

135

education. Household poverty was assessed using wealth indices as determined using DHS

136

methods using principal components analysis(20) . Cutoff points for wealth quintiles were

137

determined to be the values closest to but less than the 20, 40, 60 and 80th percentiles of the

138

cumulative wealth index. We estimated for all household members, injury or illness in the 4

139

weeks prior to the interview, whether household members had sought care for these illnesses or

140

injuries, and whether they had had to miss work activities or school because of the illness/injury.

141

Maternal age at birth was calculated from estimated maternal and child birthdates and was

142

assessed as a continuous variable and a 4-category variable (age 15-19, 20-24, 25-34 and 35-49)

143

Orphan status was presented as a categorical variable (single maternal; single paternal; both;

144

neither; and unknown status if one or other parent’s survival was unknown); and fathers’

145

presence in the home was assessed as a binary variable.

146

Data analysis

147

We conducted descriptive analysis using frequencies and percentages for binary and categorical

148

data and medians with interquartile ranges for continuous data. We analyzed data using Stata 15

149

(Stata: College Station, TX). We assessed factors associated with the outcomes (risk for delay or

150

low development related to peers) usinglogistic regressions (for binary endpoints) and

151

accounting for clustering at the sampling level using Stata’s “cluster” function. Factors in

152

univariable analysis significant at an alpha of 0.1 were entered into a full multivariable model

153

and reduced to a final model using backward stepwise regression with an alpha of 0.05 for

154

retention. Wald tests were used to compare reduced to full models. We assessed factors in the

155

final models for interaction.

Ethics review

157

The protocol and tools for the IHOPE cohort were reviewed and approved by the Harvard

158

Medical School Institutional Review Board and the Madagascar National Ethics Committee.

159

Verbal consent was obtained from eligible adults (ages 15-59) and from parents or legal

160

guardians for children’s participation. All data was de-identified data prior to analysis;

161

investigators had only access to data identifiable at the cluster level.

163

Results

164

Sample description

165

432 children from the 2016 wave met eligibility criteria for inclusion (ages 3 to <5 years, alive at

166

interview). Table 2 describes demographics, anthropometry and developmental status of the

167

study population. Of the 432 children included, 259 (59.9%) were considered to be

168

developmentally on track, and 173 (40.1%) were at risk for delay based on ECDI scores. Sixty-

169

eight children (16.0%) were considered to have low development compared to peers. In our

170

sample, the mean ECDI score was 5.12 (range 1-10, SD 1.56). The mean for children at risk for

171

delay was 4.6 (1.8 SD) and 5.5 (1.23 SD) in children whose development was on track for both

172

outcome measures. For children with low development compared to peers, mean ECDI score

173

was 2.8(0.57 SD). By individual domain, literacy/numeracy had the lowest proportion (7.2%) of

174

children with on-track development, while physical (85.4%), learning (86.6%) and socio-

175

emotional (82.6%) domains had substantially higher proportions.

176

Of 431 children with at least some completed developmental support questions,76 (17.6%) had

177

adult support for development (4 or more different developmentally stimulating activities in the

178

last 3 days), and 106 children (24.6%) had no adult support for development (0 developmentally

179

supportive activities conducted by an adult in the last 3 days). The median number of

180

developmentally supportive activities provided to a child was 2 [range 0-8].

181

Factors in univariable analysis associated at an alpha of 0.1 with being at risk for delay compared

182

to international standards included household poverty (bottom 2 quintiles—Odds Ratio (OR)

183

1.52 95% Confidence Interval CI (1.03, 2.25)), adult disengagement, and increasing number of

184

activities provided by the father (OR 1.39 95%CI 1.04, 1.86). Factors associated with being

185

developmentally on track included being left in the care of an older child (OR for delay 0.48

186

95%CI 0.30,0.76), an adult playing (OR 0.49 95%CI 0.31, 0.76) or singing songs (OR 0.58

187

95%CI0.37. 0.89) with the child, and higher number of activities by a non-parental adult (OR

188

0.64 95% CI 0.53, 0.76). Table 3 shows full and reduced models of factors associated with being

189

at risk for delay. In the final model, increase in number of activities by the father (adjusted OR

190

(aOR)1.59 95% CI1.13, 2.21) was associated with being at risk, and adult playing with the child

191

(aOR 0.54 95%CI 0.31, 0.94) and increase in activities provided by a non-parental adult (aOR

192

0.64 95% CI 0.53, 0.76) were associated with on track development.

193

Table 4 shows factors in the full and reduced models for low development compared to peers. In

194

univariable analyses, factors negatively associated at an alpha of 0.1 with development compared

195

to peers included household poverty (bottom 2 wealth quintiles OR 2.16 95%CI 1.20, 3.89)),

196

adolescent mother (age <20) (OR 3.09 95%CI1.18, 8.13), an increasing number of other under 5

197

children in the home (OR 2.06 95%CI1.11, 3.82), and having moderate to severe wasting (OR

198

2.65 95%CI 0.91, 7.72)). Factors positively associated with development included having an

199

adult engage in at least 4 developmentally supportive activities (OR 0.33 for delay 95%CI 0.15,

200

0.72), increase in engagement by a non-parental adult (OR 0.43 95%CI0.30, 0.63), playing with

household or other found objects as toys (OR 0.41 95%CI 0.21, 0.79), specific activities of an

202

adult playing with (OR 0.49 95%CI 0.25, 0.97) and singing to the child (OR 0.44 95%CI 0.24,

203

0.81), the child having an illness or injury in the last 4 weeks (OR 0.43 95%CI 0.24, 0.81) or

204

being left with another child as caregiver (OR 0.45 95%CI0.21, 0.94). In the final model, having

205

other under 5 children in the household, an adolescent mother (aOR 3.89 95%CI1.32, 11.48), and

206

an adult taking the child outside (aOR 3.03 95%CI 1.14, 6.45) were associated with having low

207

development scores. Being ill or injured in the last 4 weeks (aOR for delay 0.40 95%CI 0.21,

208

0.76), playing with household or found objects as toys (aOR 0.33 95%CI 0.14, 0.73) and an

209

increase in activities with an adult other than mother or father (aOR 0.2895%CI0.16, 0.50) were

210

associated with higher development scores.

211

Discussion:

212

A high proportion of the children (40.1%) were considered to be at risk for delay based on

213

international standards. This was driven mostly by the literacy and numeracy domain, with only

214

7% of children considered developmentally on track. This is similar to the most recent published

215

subnational MICS for Madagascar (2012) in which 7.4% of children were on track in this

216

domain, compared to 94.2% in physical, 80.3 in socio-emotional and 83.7% in the learning

217

domain(11). Early literacy in western cultures is associated with better school performance, and

218

early language skills are associated with cognitive development in both low and high resource

219

settings(21-23). Relative poverty has been shown in both wealthy and poor settings to be

220

associated with lower performance on language scales. A study by Fernald et al in Madagascar

221

demonstrated that poverty relative to others was also associated with lower development,

222

particularly in the language domain(24). Although relative poverty was not associated with lower

223

development in our study after adjusting for other factors including playing with the child and

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011064; this version posted November 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

224

increase in stimulation by adults, this finding aligns with a 2000 study in the US(25) that found

225

that effect of poverty on development was completely mediated by health and home stimulation

226

factors. Poverty’s independent influence on development merits further study.

227
228

There may be differences in cultural norms around when the foundations of literacy are laid

229

down. Conversations with parents in Ifanadiana suggest that although physical and socio-

230

emotional development are the focus of attention by caregivers, children are not expected to

231

learn to read until they start public school at age 5. Parents in Ifanadiana often have low literacy

232

themselves, with limited capacity to prioritize and model literacy and numeracy for young

233

children outside of school. And culturally, tools to stimulate development of this domain, such as

234

children’s picture books, are both very rare in Malagasy languages, and very expensive to obtain

235

(personal communication, LRR). Another possible explanation of this phenomenon is that the

236

ECDI literacy/numeracy domain is simply inappropriate in this setting. The numeracy

237

component in particular, asks if children know the name and recognize the symbols of numbers

238

up to 10, which is more advanced for the same age on comparable tools, which assess a child’s

239

ability to simply count to 10. (McCoy).. The use of the ECDI tool in the international MICS

240

surveys implies that despite obvious cultural and linguistic differences, all children globally

241

should be measured in a similar fashion. Further research is needed on whether the ECDI literacy

242

domain is relevant in this context.

243
244

A high proportion of children in our cohort were stunted—50.5% had moderate or severe and

245

19.0% were severely stunted. Stunting is so closely associated with developmental risk that it is

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011064; this version posted November 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

246

used as a proxy in international estimates(1). In this setting of very high stunting rates, chronic

247

malnutrition was not statistically significantly associated with developmental risk when

248

controlling for other factors. In an analysis of MICS data from multiple countries, stunting was

249

observed to be a good predictor for some, but not all domains of the ECDI; the relationship

250

between stunting and literacy-numeracy varied by country and high vs. low breast feeding

251

status(Miller et al 2015). These results highlight the importance of the PNAN III strategy for

252

reducing malnutrition in these areas, as many cognitive effects of chronic malnutrition may only

253

become apparent as deficits in metacognitive skills (such as memorization, concentration and

254

attention) at a later age when a child starts school and learning may be compromised.

255

Malnutrition reduction must include not just prevention of new cases but effective treatment of

256

prevalent cases to assist in counteracting growth faltering. In other areas with high rates of

257

stunting, robust malnutrition interventions targeted at smaller areas have been successful at

258

reducing stunting at the population or community level(10, 26). However, important hidden

259

factors contributing to growth-faltering, such as gender roles, age at onset of stunting, breast

260

feeding duration, maternal mental health, dietary diversity and micronutrient availability can

261

vary from site to site; thus formative research in communities should be undertaken to

262

understand how national programs can be adapted on bolstered to have greatest effects.

263
264

Adult disengagement was also quite high in this cohort, with almost 25% of children getting no

265

stimulating activities at all from adults. In this setting, engagement by an adult other than the

266

mother or father was quite important. Unfortunately, the standardized questionnaire from the

267

MICS (which we used in this study) does not indicate the specific relationship of the other adult

households in Madagascar as well as in this cohort include multiple generations. The median

270

number of people per household in our cohort was 5, with a range from 1 to 18. Children in

271

Ifanadiana, especially those born to young or unmarried mothers, are frequently raised in a

272

grandparent-headed household. When a mother marries, she may take her young children with

273

her, but often they are left in the household of the maternal grandparents (FR, personal

274

communication), and in some areas of Madagascar, families practice a custom of giving the

275

firstborn child to a grandparent to raise(LRR, personal communication). Grandmothers or aunts,

276

thus, are often responsible for young children, especially those of younger mothers. It is

277

reasonable to suppose that most often, a grandmother is the most deeply engaged “other” adult.

278

Evidence-based interventions that incorporate both nutrition and development stimulation

279

activities could be developed or adapted using community-based participatory research in this

280

setting.

281
282

Although only 5% of our population were born to adolescent mothers, being under 20 at the birth

283

of the child was associated with delay compared to both international standards and to peers.

284

Around the world, mothers play a central role in the development of their children. In

285

Madagascar, as in many countries, socialization and discipline of a child until approximately age

286

5 is generally the purview of the mother or other female relatives (27). Early motherhood is

287

associated in global studies with infant and child mortality, preterm birth and stunting, both of

288

which are associated with reduced child development ((28, 29)). Girl child marriage (defined as

289

marriage before the age of 18) has been associated with off-track development in multiple

290

countries including Madagascar; much of this association is explained by disparities in advanced

291

education and wealth (30). Supporting young women to marry and initiate childbirth later could,

292

thus, have intergenerational benefits. In Madagascar, the legal minimum age of marriage is 18

293

years, but in rural areas especially, marriage and childbirth often happen earlier for a variety of

294

cultural and economic reasons. This puts both the adolescent girls who become mothers and their

295

babies at increased risk for worse economic, health and development outcomes. Additionally,

296

understanding of both men’s and women’s fertility preferences can be combined with family

297

planning and ready contraception availability in health centers. Such projects are underway in

298

Ifanadiana through the efforts of PIVOT and the MOH.

299
300

Factors such as higher number of paternal supportive activities (and not being left in the care of

301

another child were associated with a higher proportion of risk for delay. While this may reflect

302

some sort of detrimental or harsh parenting practices on the part of fathers, a more likely

303

possibility is that if a child is more in need, fathers spend more time focused on the child at risk.

304

Fathers in Ifanadiana are expected to provide for the family and provide some care in times of

305

emergency, but development is not usually their purview (FR, personal communication).

306

However, if a child is faltering in some way, the father may do more activities with the child than

307

a child who is not. The same thing could be true of being left alone with another child. When

308

children are being weaned (age 2, usually because of the advent of another child) even in parent-

309

headed rather than grandparent-headed households, mothers distance themselves and children

310

then become the responsibility of older children in the household (FR, personal communication).

311

This pattern of young children becoming the responsibility of older children around age 2 has

312

been documented in other areas of Madagascar (27) and is common in other settings outside of

313

Madagascar. Children whose development or behavior may be raising red flags in the family

314

may be less likely to be left with other children than those children with development perceived

315

as normal. Surprisingly, having an illness or injury in the last 4 weeks was positively associated

316

with development, which could suggest that active and social children may be more likely to get

317

ill or injured.

318
319

This study has several limitations. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of population-level

320

data to understand the burden of and factors associated with risk of delay in Ifanadiana district.

321

Causal inference cannot be assumed. To the best of our knowledge, no deep ethnographic studies

322

of the population of Ifanadiana exist, so our understanding of the familial dynamics and

323

relationships in Ifanadiana is based on the work of PIVOT’s community health and social work

324

team, which have daily interactions with local families and vulnerable patients. Therefore it is

325

possible that some nuances of relationships have not been well-characterized. The ECDI is a

326

brief population screen meant to provide population level estimates of risk of delay, and not

327

designed to clinically diagnose actual delay or disability in individual children. Also, we rely on

328

self-reported data—the ECDI is administered in an interview to each child’s mother or primary

329

female care-giver, so reports of adult-provided stimulation activities are dependent on the

330

mother’s knowledge, which could lead to misclassification of adult involvement. Nevertheless,

331

the ECDI has been validated on multiple continents and is a standard tool used for a decade in

332

population level surveys to estimate burden of risk of delay, so our findings can be compared to

333

those from Madagascar as a whole and globally. Despite these limitations, our findings

334

contribute to the small body of literature on the burden and risks of developmental delay in low-

335

resource rural settings. Future qualitative explanatory studies including the use of culturally-

336

relevant development screening tools as well as a longitudinal analysis of future waves of the

337

IHOPE cohort data will help to establish directionality of effects and to propose areas of

338

intervention and risk mitigation.

339
340

Conclusions

341

Although chronic malnutrition was not independently associated with delay risk in this

342

population with high rates of stunting, a high proportion of Malagasy children in this cohort are

343

at risk for developmental delay, specifically in the areas of early literacy and numeracy. A low

344

proportion of children receive developmentally supportive stimulation from adults, but non-

345

parent adults provide more stimulation in general than either mother or father. Stimulation from

346

non-parent adults is associated with lower risk of delay. When compared with their peers,

347

children born to adolescent mothers had a higher risk of delay at 3-4 years of age. Interventions

348

targeting children’s development should be directed at the whole family, including fathers, non-

349

parent adults and older children, as all have important roles in the raising of young children in

350

this setting. Research on the practice of child marriage would be beneficial in this setting as well.
