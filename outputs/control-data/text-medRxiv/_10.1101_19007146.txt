Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) may harbor the potential to capture
the metabolic complexity in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Here we set out to test
the performance of metabolites in blood to categorise AD when compared to
CSF biomarkers.
METHODS: This study analysed samples from 242 cognitively normal (CN)
people and 115 with AD-type dementia utilizing plasma metabolites (n=883).
Deep Learning (DL), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random
Forest (RF) were used to differentiate AD from CN. These models were
internally validated using Nested Cross Validation (NCV).
RESULTS: On the test data, DL produced the AUC of 0.85 (0.80-0.89),
XGBoost produced 0.88 (0.86-0.89) and RF produced 0.85 (0.83-0.87). By
comparison, CSF measures of amyloid, p-tau and t-tau (together with age and
gender) produced with XGBoost the AUC values of 0.78, 0.83 and 0.87,
respectively.
DISCUSSION: This study showed that plasma metabolites have the potential
to match the AUC of well-established AD CSF biomarkers in a relatively small
cohort. Further studies in independent cohorts are needed to validate whether
this specific panel of blood metabolites can separate AD from controls, and how
specific it is for AD as compared with other neurodegenerative disorders

1. Introduction
At present, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease–type dementia (AD) is based
on protein biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain imaging together
with a battery of cognition tests. Diagnostic tools based on CSF collection are
invasive while brain-imaging tools are still costly, and therefore, there is a need
to identify non-invasive tools for early detection as well as for measuring
disease progression.
In recent years, an increasing number of studies have examined blood
metabolites as potential AD biomarkers [1-4]. The advantages of looking at
blood metabolites are that they are easily accessible but also that they
represent an essential aspect of the phenotype of an organism and hence might
act as a molecular fingerprint of disease progression [5, 6]. Therefore, blood
AD markers could potentially aid early diagnosis and recruitment for trials.
Here we utilised data generated as part of the European Medical Information
Framework for AD Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD) previously
reported in full in Kim et al [8]. As discussed in that paper, metabolite levels
were measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) to
cover ca. 800 metabolites and these metabolites related to CSF biomarkers of
AD commonly used in clinical research including trials, and increasingly in
clinical practice, as part of the diagnostic work up. Here we explore the potential
of different machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify those individuals with
AD from dataset and to compare the effectiveness of blood based metabolites
as an indicator of clinical diagnosis to that of CSF markers. In this study we
employed two state of the art ML algorithms - Deep Learning (DL) and Extreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) - and compared these to the more commonly
utilized Random Forest (RF) algorithm.

2. Methods
This study accessed data previously generated from 242 samples from
cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 115 from people with AD-type dementia
(AD) samples in which diagnosis was based on clinical diagnosis. Details on
the subjects, clinical and cognitive data as well as measurements of AD
pathological markers have been described elsewhere [7, 8]. The metabolomics
data employed here was accessed in the EMIF-AD portal and the acquisition
and processing details can be found via open access in [8]. In short, the EMIFAD cohort is a collated cohort making use of existing data and samples
collected in 11 different studies across Europe, with the aim to discover novel
diagnostic and prognostic markers for predementia AD.
In the current study, the main objective was to use state of the art ML
classification algorithms to build CN vs AD predictive models using blood
metabolites. For this purpose, we employed DL and XGBoost. Additionally we
also employed the more popularly used RF) algorithm. These models were
compared in terms of binary classifiers with Area Under the Curve (AUC) in
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
The metabolites with more than 45% missing values were discarded. The
remaining missing values were handled with imputation methods based on the
k-nearest neighbour (RF and DL), or internally by the classification algorithm
(XGBoost). Models were built and evaluated using a Nested Cross Validation
(NCV) which used 9/10 data folds for model training and optimisation in an inner
cross validation, and 1/10 data folds for model testing in an outer cross
validation. The process was repeated 10 times, for each of the test data folds.
The analysis was further extended by assessing the stability of the AUC
performance with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations consisting of 50 repeated
similar NCV experiments. As such, multiple models were built on multiple
samples in the NCV and MC, using metabolite predictors selected on the basis
of their capability to discriminate CN vs AD as measured by the Relief algorithm
[9] applied on training data in combination with 500 permutations of the

outcome variable’s values. This method computes the predictors’ importance
defined as the standardised Relief score, according to Measuring Predictor
Importance chapter of [10]. Part of the prediction modelling methodology in this
study was adapted after [11], with different algorithms, and followed
recommendations from [10, 12]. The analysis was carried out using R software
[13]. Pathway analysis was performed on the top 20 ranked metabolites using
MetaboAnalyst 4.0 [14]. The algorithms were run on four servers with 6-core
Xeon CPUs and 336 GB RAM.

3. Results
In this study, we analysed metabolite data derived from blood samples from
358 participants (CN n=242, AD n=115) previously reported in Kim et al [8].
Demographic and clinical data can be found in [8]; in short, there was no
difference in gender while AD participants were older when compared with CN
participants.
On the test data, the DL model produced a Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.85 with its 95% confidence
interval (CI) ranging between [0.8038, 0.8895]. The XGBoost model produced
the AUC value of 0.88 (95% CI [0.8619, 0.8903]). When the classifier model RF
was employed, the resulting AUC was 0.85 (95%CI [0.8323, 0.8659]). Fig. 1
illustrates ROC curves obtained from the three ML models.
The MC simulation conducted with XGBoost which was the superior predictive
model in our analysis, led to a Gaussian distribution of the AUC values
according to [11] and as confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk test (p-value=0.6819). The
50 AUC values obtained in MC had a minimum of 0.8614, a maximum of
0.8923, a mean of 0.8761, a median of 0.8766, and a standard deviation of
0.0072. The t-test showed that the true mean of AUC for XGBoost applied on
plasma metabolites was not lower than 0.87 (p-value=1.265X10-07).
For comparison, we also investigated the levels of amyloid, p-tau and t-tau, to
which we added also age and gender, and their prediction for clinical AD vs
CN. XGBoost models were built in the same manner as for metabolite
predictors. Together with age and gender, amyloid led to AUC 0.78 (95%CI
[0.7626, 0.8013]); p-tau led to AUC 0.83 (95%CI [0.8188, 0.8470]); and t-tau
led to AUC 0.87 (95%CI [0.8583, 0.8854]). From the mean AUC for metabolites
and for amyloid, p-tau and t-tau calculated individually, the t-tests showed
superior values for metabolites (p-value<2.2X10-16, p-value<2.2X10-16, and pvalue=0.005921, respectively).

4. Discussion
Machine Learning applied to healthcare is increasingly enabled by the advent
of high-performance computing and the development of complex algorithms. In
this study, we employed two state of the art algorithms, DL and XGBoost, and
a more conventional algorithm, RF, to obtain high accuracy models to predict
AD vs CN with metabolites as predictors. Our study showed that the best model
was based on XGBoost [15] which is an enhanced form of Gradient Boosting
Machines methods based on decision trees [12]. In our study RF and DL
achieved comparable AUC. DL algorithms are known to often take advantage
of large and/or unstructured data (such as images) to produce more accurate
category discrimination/ prediction. In a study using the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data for AD prediction, XGBoost demonstrated
superior results (AUC= 0.97 (0.01)) when including imaging parameters (MRI
and PET) as predictors and when compared to RF, Support Vector Machines,
Gaussian Processes and Stochastic Gradient Boosting [16]. In other study
where cognition and MRI were used as predictors, Kernel Ridge Regression
performed to R2=0.87 (0.025) when cognition and MRI predictors were included
[17].
Pathway analyses using the top 20 AD predicting metabolites derived from the
Relief method showed that the Nitrogen pathway was overrepresented. Some
of the molecules selected have been reported in metabolomics studies and
have been implicated in neurodegeneration: Dodecanate, which is a C12 fatty
acid, was found correlated to longitudinal measures of cognition in the ADNI
cohort [3] and so was the bile acid glycolithocholate which was associated to
both AD and cognition measures (ADAS-Cog13) in one of the biggest crosssectional studies on cognition, AD and the microbiome [18]. Plasmalogens
were also found in decreased levels in our cohort in agreement with an earlier
report [19]. The amide form of vitamin B3, nicotamide, has been implicated in
both neuroprotection and neuronal death [20].
New metabolites that could be of interest and have not been previously reported
as related to AD were phytanate and furoylglycine. The former is a known

neurotoxin which impairs mitochondrial function and transcription [21].
Furoylglycine is a metabolite which, as lithocholic acid, is mainly synthesized
by the microbiome and has been reported as a biomarker of coffee
consumption [22].
A limitation of our study is that it does not include an external validation due to
the size of the cohort. However, we implemented a NCV procedure repeated
50 times in a MC simulation that led to an extended internal validation with
prediction accuracy of cases. Further studies will assess the performance of
ratios/combinations of CSF markers and metabolites, life-style factors and
disorders commonly found in the elderly, together with testing the specificity for
this specific panel in other neurodegenerative (e.g. PD, FTD), neurological (e.g.
stroke) and psychiatric (e.g. depression) disorders associated with aging.
The intent of this paper was to compare the performance of different ML
algorithms to identify people with AD from cognitively unimpaired individuals.
Here we show first that all three approaches used demonstrate good
discriminatory power, second that XGBoost is somewhat more effective in this
particular dataset than RF and DL and third, that this accuracy for clinical
diagnosis is broadly similar to that achieved by CSF markers of AD pathology.
The lack of a replication and validation dataset limits the interpretation of this
finding but nonetheless the strong prediction of diagnostic category from a
blood based metabolite biomarker set is further evidence of the potential of
such approaches to complement other biomarkers in identification of people
with likely AD
