ABSTRACT

Following a Traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) decreases cardiovascular risk. However,
its anti-thrombotic effects are unexplored. We aimed to assess whether this dietary pattern
improved thrombosis-related biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk subjects. In 358
random PREDIMED Study volunteers (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), we assessed:
1) 1-year effects of a TMD, enriched in virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; N=120) or nuts (TMDNuts; N=119) versus a low-fat diet (N=119), on thrombosis biomarkers; 2) the differences
between individuals with greater TMD compliance increments (≥3 adherence score points)
and those with compliance decrements; and 3) associations between 1-year changes in
key TMD food groups and thrombosis signals. TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts attenuated prothrombotic status (-5.1% –P=0.045– and -5.8% –P=0.025–, respectively). TMD-VOO
decreased HDL-bound α1-antitrypsin levels (HDL pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic
properties, -6.3%, P=0.034) and increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase
activity (+7.5%, P=0.044). TMD-Nuts diminished non-esterified fatty acid levels (-10.3%,
P=0.022). Individuals with greater TMD adherence increments presented decreases in
their pro-thrombotic status (-9.5%, P=0.032), fibrinogen levels (-9.1%, P=0.030), and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations (-18.1%, P=0.011). Only the low-fat diet was associated
with increased platelet factor-4 concentrations (P=0.012) and thrombin activation (higher
prothrombin factor1+2 levels, P=0.003) versus baseline. Finally, in the secondary analyses,
nut intake increases were associated with antithrombin increments, fruit and vegetable
consumption increases were linked to decreases of thrombin activation, and processed
meat intake decrements were related to increases in antithrombin and nitrite + nitrate
levels (P<0.05). Summarizing, TMD and some of its typical food items were associated
with improved thrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals.

INTRODUCTION

Following a traditional Mediterranean Diet (TMD) prevents the development of
cardiovascular outcomes1,2. As observed in the PREDIMED Study (Prevención con Dieta
Mediterránea), TMD effects on cardiovascular protection may be mediated by
improvements in risk factors related to blood pressure, glucose metabolism, oxidative
stress, and low-grade inflammation3. However, very scarce evidence related to TMD
effects on other mechanisms such as thrombosis is available.
Thrombosis consists of the formation of a clot to avoid blood loss in the case of a vessel
disruption. However, its excessive activation is also linked to an increased risk of
atherosclerotic outcomes4. Thrombus generation is based on the occurrence of four
phenomena (apparition of an endothelial lesion, platelet aggregation, activation of the
coagulation cascade, and fibrinolysis) which, in turn, are constituted by a chain of
intertwined biochemical responses4. Excessive levels of biomarkers related to these
responses (or defective, in the case of fibrinolysis) are linked to an increased risk of
suffering atherosclerotic events. This association has been particularly reported for plasma
biomarkers of endothelial damage (von Willebrand factor5), platelet aggregation (Pselectin6, platelet factor-47), activation of coagulation (fibrinogen8, thrombin formation –
directly proportional to the levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2–9, antithrombin10), and
fibrinolysis (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 –PAI1–11, D-dimer12). Other substances
(such as non-esterified fatty acids and nitrite + nitrate levels) have been shown to be
involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases through their capacity to modulate
endothelial stress and platelet activation13,14. Finally, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) have
also been attributed antithrombotic properties15. On the one hand, HDLs are deeply
involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, which have been shown to promote
thrombosis8. On the other hand, HDLs carry enzymes able to metabolize pro-thrombotic

signals such as the platelet activating factor16 (the platelet activating factor
acetylhydrolase, PAF-AH).
Very few interventions with healthy dietary patterns have been associated with changes in
thrombosis biomarkers. Following a TMD has only been associated with a decrease in Pselectin levels in high cardiovascular risk subjects in the context of the PREDIMED Trial17.
Beyond this study, a cross-sectional study reported an inverse association between
adherence to a Mediterranean-like diet and platelet levels18. Finally, other small-scale
prospective analysis with 21 young, healthy male volunteers assessed the impact of a
TMD-like diet for 90 days on thrombosis biomarkers, and reported that this dietary pattern
was associated with lower fibrinogen levels and a moderation of the coagulation
response19. However, no extensive analysis of the long-term TMD effects on thrombosis
mechanisms has been performed to date in a large-scale intervention trial.
Our main aim was to assess whether a 1-year intervention with TMD improved a
comprehensive set of endothelial stress, platelet, coagulation, and fibrinolysis-related
biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk subjects. Our secondary aim was to determine
whether there were associations between 1-year changes in the consumption of key food
group whose intake was modified in the TMD intervention (virgin olive oil, nuts, fruits and
vegetables, legumes, fish, and processed meat) and thrombosis biomarkers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

risk1. Volunteers were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline but presented type 2
diabetes mellitus or at least three of the following risk factors: high low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels, low HDL cholesterol concentrations, hypertension, overweight/obesity,
current smoking, or family history of premature heart disease. Individuals were randomly
assigned to follow one of the three following intervention groups (in a 1:1:1 ratio): 1) a
TMD supplemented with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO); 2) a TMD supplemented with mixed
nuts (TMD-Nuts); and 3) a low-fat control diet. Further details of inclusion and exclusion
criteria and the dietary intervention are available in Supplemental Methods.
We selected a random subsample of 358 subjects (4.8% of the total PREDIMED
population, belonging to Hospital Clinic and IMIM study sites, with biological samples at
baseline and after 1 year of dietary intervention) for the present analyses. 120 volunteers
were allocated to the TMD-VOO intervention group, 119 to the TMD-Nuts one, and 119 to
the low-fat diet. In these individuals, age, sex and educational level data were gathered at
baseline. At baseline and after 1 year of intervention, trained clinical personnel collected
the following information: 1) body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, and medication
use; 2) physical activity levels (using a validated Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity
Questionnaire; 3) adherence to a Mediterranean diet (the 14-item Mediterranean Diet
adherence score20, used as a continuous variable); and 4) intake of 137 food items in the
previous year (using a validated food frequency questionnaire). From the information in the
food frequency questionnaires, we calculated the intakes of key TMD food groups
(Supplemental Methods). In addition, trained nurses collected plasma and serum
samples, and stored at -80ºC upon use and to quantify the levels of fasting glucose, total
and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides by automatized methods1,21.

Thrombosis biomarkers
We determined thrombosis biomarkers in biological samples collected at baseline and
after 1 year of intervention. We used ELISA kits to quantify the levels of: fibrinogen
(Human Fibrinogen SimpleStep ELISA kit, ref.: ab208036, abcam, UK), plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1; Human PAI1 SimpleStep ELISA kit (SERPINE1), ref.:
ab184863, abcam, UK), platelet factor-4 (PF4 (CXCL4) Human SimpleStep ELISA kit,
ref.:ab189573, abcam, UK), prothrombin fragment 1+2 (Human F1+2 (prothrombin
fragment 1+2) ELISA kit, ref.: E-EL-H1793, Elabscience, USA), and von Willebrand factor
(Human von Willebrand factor SimpleStep ELISA kit, ref.: ab223864, abcam, UK). We
assessed the concentrations of antithrombin (Antithrombin III, ref.: SR-1102016, Spinreact,
Spain) and D-dimer (D-Dimer, ref.: SR-1709231, Spinreact, Spain) by immunoturbidimetry,
and of non-esterified fatty acids (Non-Esterified Fatty Acids, ref.: FA115, Randox, Spain)
using a colorimetric technique in an ABX-Pentra 400 autoanalyzer (Horiba-ABX, France).
We quantified nitrates + nitrites by means of a colorimetric kit (Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric
Assay Kit, ref.: CAY-780001, Cayman Chemical, USA). All the previous analyses were
performed in citrate plasma samples. In parallel, in apolipoprotein B-depleted plasma
samples (specimen in which all lipoproteins but high-density lipoproteins –HDLs– were
eliminated, prepared from citrate plasma samples22), we determined the levels of total
cholesterol by colorimetry (Cholesterol Enzymatic-Colorimetry, ref.: SR-41022, Spinreact,
Spain) and of α1-antitrypsin (a-1-antitrypsin, ref.: SR-1102054, Spinreact, Spain) by
immunoturbidimetry in an ABX-Pentra 400 autoanalyzer (Horiba-ABX, France). With this

data, we calculated the α1-antitrypsin/cholesterol ratio. We also determined in these
samples the activity of the PAF-AH enzyme by a colorimetric kit (PAF Acetylhydrolase
Activity Assay Kit, ref.: K765-1000, Cayman Chemical, USA). An extended explanation of
the quality control, inter-assay coefficients of variation, and the number of missing values
of each determination is available in Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Table 2.

Sample size
Since the only thrombosis-related biomarker assessed in the PREDIMED Study was Pselectin, we assumed that its variability would be similar to that in our variables. Thus, a
sample size of 119 individuals per group (total sample size: N=357) allowed ≥80% power
to detect a 10% change relative to the mean baseline value of P-selectin levels (7.65
ng/mL) between post-and pre-intervention values, and a 14% change relative to the mean
baseline value (10.8 ng/mL) in the differences among the three diets, considering a 2sided type I error of 0.05, a loss rate of 5%, and the standard deviation of the differences
in P-selectin values in this intervention (SD=28.9 ng/mL)17.

Statistical analyses
We first checked the distribution of continuous variables in normality plots and by the
Shapiro-Wilk test. We assessed whether there were differences in baseline values among
the three intervention groups with one-way ANOVA tests for normally distributed
continuous variables, Kruskal-Wallis tests for non-normally distributed continuous ones,
and chi-squared tests (or exact Fisher tests when expected frequencies were <5) for
categorical parameters.
We first calculated a continuous score reflecting the general activation of the thrombosis
mechanisms. In biomarkers where high concentrations were associated with a more prothrombotic state (von Willebrand factor, platelet factor-4, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment

1+2, D-dimer, PAI-1, non-esterified fatty acids, and α1-antitrypsin in HDL), we assigned
values from 1 to 5 to the volunteers located in increasing quintiles. On the contrary, in
biomarkers where high levels were linked to a less pro-thrombotic state (antithrombin,
nitrites+nitrates, and PAF-AH activity in HDL), we assigned values from 5 to 1 to the
volunteers located in increasing quintiles. For each biomarker, the same cut points were
used at baseline and after 1 year of intervention. By summing these scores, we obtained a
general pro-thrombotic score ranging from 11 (all biomarkers located in the least prothrombotic quintile) to 55 (all biomarkers located in the most pro-thrombotic quintile), in
which higher scores indicated a higher pro-thrombotic state. These scores were only
calculated in those volunteers with no missing values in any of the thrombosis biomarker
variables at both time points (N=299).
We analyzed differences between pre- and post-intervention values in every intervention
by paired t tests in normally distributed variables and Wilcoxon signed rank tests in nonnormally distributed parameters. We checked whether there were differences in the 1-year
changes in thrombosis biomarkers (calculated by subtracting baseline to post-intervention
values) in the TMD interventions relative to the low-fat control diet by multivariate linear
regressions (intention-to-treat analyses). We also compared with these regression models
the differences in the 1-year changes in the volunteers with greater increases in TMD
adherence (individuals incrementing their compliance in ≥3 points of the 14-item
Mediterranean Diet score, N=66) relative to those who decreased their adherence in
relation to baseline values (high versus low compliance analyses). Finally, in a secondary
exploratory approach, we studied whether there were associations between 1-year
changes in the intake of food groups whose consumption was significantly modified in the
TMD interventions relative to the low-fat diet (virgin olive oil, nuts, fruits and vegetables,
legumes, fish, and processed meat; see the “Study population” paragraph in the Results
section) and thrombosis biomarkers by additional multivariate linear regression analyses.

To promote the interpretability of data, results were presented as percentage changes
relative to baseline values (to calculate them, we divided the adjusted difference
coefficients obtained in the regression models by the baseline value of the variable in each
of the groups). Models were adjusted for: age, sex, study site, educational level (primary
education or lower/secondary or equivalent/higher education), baseline value of the
variable, fasting glucose levels, use of antidiabetic drugs (yes/no), cholesterol
concentrations, triglyceride values (log-transformed), use of lipid-lowering drugs (yes/no),
systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive drugs (yes/no), use of antithrombotic
drugs (yes/no), tobacco use (never/former/actual smoker), body mass index, leisure-time
physical activity (log-transformed), and two propensity scores to correct for the theoretical
deviations in the randomization process (calculated from 30 baseline variables)1. High
versus low compliance and food group intake analyses were additionally adjusted for the
TMD adherence score or the intake of each particular food group at baseline, respectively,
and for the PREDIMED intervention group. Models were plotted using the “lme” package in
R Software23.
We considered any two-sided P-value<0.05 as significant and performed statistical
analyses with R software version 3.5.024.

RESULTS

Study population and dietary intervention
We found no significant differences in clinical variables at baseline among the individuals
assigned to the three intervention groups (Table 1). Regarding the non-included
PREDIMED Study subjects, there were 6.2% more women and 7.4% less antithrombotic
drug users among our volunteers and they presented higher glucose (6 mg/dL), total
cholesterol (5 mg/dL), and leisure-time physical activity levels (22 METs·min/d) (P<0.05)
(Supplemental Table 3). Physical activity did not change throughout the study (P>0.05).
Volunteers’ compliance to the dietary intervention was correct according to the
Mediterranean diet adherence score: we observed a 1.10 and 1.35-point increment in
score values after 1 year of intervention in the TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts interventions,
respectively (P<0.001, relative to the low-fat diet) (Supplemental Table 4). Volunteers
allocated in the TMD-VOO intervention group increased their compliance due to
increments in the consumption of virgin olive oil (+3.5 servings/day), fruits and vegetables
(+0.8 servings/d), legumes (+0.2 servings/day), and fish (+0.2 servings/d), whilst those in
the TMD-Nuts group incremented their adherence due to increases in the intake of nuts
(+1.2 servings/d), legumes (+0.1 servings/d –only marginally–), and fatty fish (+0.2
servings/d), and decreases in the consumption of processed meat (-0.2 servings/d)
(P<0.05, relative to the low-fat diet). Volunteers with greater compliance increments
presented a 4.63 point increase in the TMD adherence score due to increases in the
consumption of virgin olive oil (+1.8 servings/d), nuts (+0.6 servings/d), fruits and
vegetables (+2.4 servings/d), legumes (+0.2 servings/d), and fish (+0.6 servings/d), and
decreases in red meat intake (-0.3 servings/d) (P<0.05, in relation to the volunteers with
decrements in TMD adherence). Finally, low-fat diet compliance was observed as a
reduction in the consumption of fats, based on a decrease of the intake of mixed nuts and

the substitution of red for white meat (red meat consumption decreased while meat did
not) and the substitution of fatty for non-fatty fish (total fish intake increased while fatty fish
did not) (P<0.05, relative to baseline).

TMD and thrombosis biomarkers
The thrombosis score (a measurement of the pro-thrombotic status) was attenuated by
both TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts interventions (-5.1% –P=0.045– and -5.8% –P=0.025–,
respectively, relative to the low-fat diet) (Figure 1A). TMD-VOO decreased the levels of
α1-antitrypsin (-6.3%, P=0.034, Figure 1K) and increased the activity of the platelet
activating factor-acetylhydrolase in HDLs (+7.5%, P=0.044, Figure 1L) in relation to the
control intervention. TMD-Nuts particularly diminished the concentrations of non-esterified
fatty acids versus the low-fat diet (-10.3%, P=0.022, Figure 1J). Volunteers with greater
TMD adherence increments decreased their overall pro-thrombotic status (-9.5%,
P=0.032, Figure 1A), fibrinogen levels (-9.1%, P=0.030, Figure 1D), and non-esterified
fatty acid concentrations (-18.1%, P=0.011, Figure 1J) relative to those who decreased
their TMD adherence. Finally, when assessing post- vs. pre-intervention changes, only the
low-fat diet was associated with increases in platelet factor-4 concentrations (P=0.012)
and thrombin activation (higher prothrombin factor1+2 levels, P=0.003) (Table 2). Exact
coefficients are available in Supplemental Table 5 (expressed as percentage changes
relative to baseline values) and Supplemental Table 6 (expressed as linear differences).
In the secondary exploratory approach regarding food group intake: 1) increases in nut
intake were associated with increments in antithrombin levels; 2) increases in the
consumption of fruit and vegetables were linked to decreases in thrombin activation (lower
prothrombin factor1+2 levels); and 3) decrements in the intake of processed meats were
related to increases in antithrombin and nitrite + nitrate levels (P<0.05). Exact coefficients
for these analyses are available in Supplemental Table 7 (expressed as percentage

DISCUSSION

Our results show that 1 year of intervention with TMD improves pro-thrombotic state in
high cardiovascular risk individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this trial is the largest
(N=358) and more comprehensive study on the effects of a healthy dietary pattern on the
molecular mechanisms related to thrombosis.
Thrombosis is deeply affected by inflammation and oxidative stress25,26. TMD is a lifestyle
intervention known to improve these last two risk factors3. Our data indicate that following
this dietary pattern decreased the overall pro-thrombotic response of high cardiovascular
risk subjects (around 5-6% in the subjects in the TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts groups, and up
to 10% in those with greater increases in TMD adherence) and we hypothesize that this
effect could be partially explained by a decrease in oxidative stress and low-grade
inflammation. On the one hand, following a TMD has been associated in our study with
beneficial changes in thrombosis biomarkers linked as well to low-grade inflammation such
as fibrinogen and α1-antitrypsin levels in HDL8,27. On the other hand, some particular
dietary modifications of the TMD that have been associated with beneficial changes in
thrombosis biomarkers in our data (increases in the consumption of nuts, fruits and
vegetables; decreases in the intake of processed meat) have been broadly related to
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in previous human studies28–31.
HDLs have been shown to be able to induce beneficial effects on some hemostatic
mechanisms15. In this regard, the TMD-VOO intervention led to a particular decrease in α1antitrypsin levels and an increase in PAF-AH activity in HDL particles, two potential HDL

antithrombotic properties. It is not the first time that we report that the TMD-VOO
intervention promotes HDL functionality in the PREDIMED Study22. However, our data
extend this protection to anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic HDL functions. Antioxidant
protection of typical TMD food items on HDL components could contribute to explaining an
improved activity of the lipoprotein protective enzymes (due to a greater preservation of
their non-oxidized structure)32. In addition, the capacity of this dietary pattern to decrease
the levels of inflammation biomarkers in circulation may be related to a decrement in the
concentrations of pro-inflammatory molecules bound to HDL particles33.
We observed a decrease in non-esterified fatty acid levels after 1 year of TMD-Nuts
intervention (also present in subjects with greater TMD adherence increments). Nonesterified fatty acids promote endothelial stress and platelet aggregation and, therefore,
are considered an emergent pro-thrombotic risk factor in some cardiovascular risk states
(e.g., obesity, hypertriglyceridemia)13. The capacity of polyunsaturated fatty acids (whose
intake was particularly increased in the TMD-Nuts group an among individuals with greater
TMD compliance) to bind to GPR120 receptors in adipose tissue in order to decrease
lipolysis could be an explanation for this effect34,35. In addition, TMD is a fiber-rich dietary
pattern, whose intestinal metabolism leads to blood peaks of short-chain fatty acids
(known to be able to bind other GPR family receptors with a similar anti-lipolytic effect36).
Thus, a synergistic effect between these two nutrients could be expected.
Our study has several strengths. First, it presents a large sample size (N=358). Second, it
is based on a randomized design with an active comparator (low-fat control diet) and a
long-term duration (1 year). Last, it is the first analysis of the effects of a dietary pattern on
a comprehensive, hypothesis-driven set of thrombosis-related biomarkers, performed after
a strict laboratory quality control. However, it also presents limitations. First, our volunteers
were elderly people at high cardiovascular risk and, therefore, the extrapolation of our

the interventions. However, the PREDIMED trial is based on modest real-life dietary
modifications and the control diet is already a well-known healthy dietary pattern. Finally, it
was not possible to calculate the pro-thrombotic score in a random 16.5% of the
volunteers due to the missing values in the individual determinations of thrombosis
biomarkers (each marker presented missing values that were not overlapping with the
others). Nevertheless, the amount of missing values was low for individual parameters (0%
for fibrinogen and antithrombin; ≤1% for the von Willebrand factor, PAF-AH activity in
HDLs, and non-esterified fatty acids; and ≤5% for the rest of the determinations excepting
nitrites + nitrates –6.1%–) and the order in which samples were analyzed was randomly
assigned before starting the laboratory procedures. Thus, we may assume that missing
data occurred at random and did not consistently affect the rest of determinations.
In conclusion, 1 year of intervention with TMD improved the pro-thrombotic status in high
cardiovascular risk individuals. The TMD-VOO intervention enhanced HDL antithrombotic
properties, whilst the TMD-Nuts one decreased the levels of non-esterified fatty acids.
High TMD adherences particularly improved the pro-thrombotic status and decreased
fibrinogen and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations. The low-fat diet was the only
dietary group linked to increments in the levels of platelet factor-4 and prothrombin
activation. TMD effects could be particularly based on increments in the intake of nuts,
fruits, and vegetables, and decreases in processed meat consumption. As far as we know,
this is the largest, most comprehensive, hypothesis-based analysis of the effects of a
healthy dietary pattern on thrombosis mechanisms in high cardiovascular risk subjects.
Our results support the improvement of thrombosis status after following a TMD. Further
studies are needed to confirm whether these improvements mediate the reported
cardioprotective benefits of this dietary pattern.
