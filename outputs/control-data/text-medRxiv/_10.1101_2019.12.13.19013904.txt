Screening of Diabetes and Hypertension Based on Retinal Fundus Photographs
Using Deep Learning
ABSTRACT
Purpose:

The aim of this study was to use deep learning to screen for hypertension and

diabetes based on retinal fundus images.
Methods: We collected 1160 retinal photographs which included 580 from patients with a
diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes and 580 from normotensive and non-diabetic control.
We divided this image dataset into (i) a development dataset to develop model and (ii) test
dataset which were not present during the training process to assess model’s performance.
A binary classification model was trained by fine-tuning the classifier and the last convolution
layer of deep residual network. Precision, recall, the area under the ROC (AUC), and the
area under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR) were used to evaluate the performance of the
learned model.
Results: When we used 3-channel color retinal photographs to train and test model, its
prediction precision for diabetes or hypertension was 65.3%, the recall was 82.5%, the AUC
was 0.745, and the AUPR was 0.742. When we used grayscale retinal photographs to train
and test model, its prediction precision was 70.0%, the recall was 87.5%, the AUC was
0.803, and the AUPR was 0.779.
Conclusions:

Our study shows that trained deep learning model based on the retinal

fundus photographs alone can be used to screen for diabetes and hypertension, although its
current performance was not ideal.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular diseases are the world’s biggest killers, and these diseases have
remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years.1 The key risk factors
include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking and obesity, which
leads to progressive pathophysiological changes in various organs and tissues of the body,
such as blood vessels of the brain, heart, kidney, eye. In particular, retinal vasculature,
measuring 100 to 300 µm in size, attracts a lot of non-ophthalmological attention, retinal
microvascular abnormalities represent an ongoing systemic microvascular damage and can
be viewed directly and noninvasively, offering a unique and easily accessible "window" to
study the human microcirculation in vivo. Advances in digital retinal photography and
computer image analysis have now enabled more objective quantitative assessment of
retinal microvascular structure and function, and may offer a potential noninvasive research
tool to assess the pathophysiology of microvasculature in cardiovascular diseases and
generate a cardiovascular risk prediction tool.
Extensive research on retinal microvascular phenotypes in fundus images have shown
that traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension,2-22 diabetes mellitus,23-32
dyslipidemia,33-36 obesity,37-46 drinking,22,

33

smoking,33,

can cause retinal

microvascular abnormal signs to appear. These abnormal signs can be broadly divided into
four groups: classic retinopathy(i.e., diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy), isolated
retinopathy(e.g., retinal hemorrhage, microaneurysm, or cotton wool spot), changes in
retinal vascular caliber(e.g., generalized retinal arteriolar narrowing, focal arteriolar

narrowing, arteriovenous nicking), and changes in retinal vascular architecture (e.g., retinal
tortuosity, fractal dimension, branching angle). These signs probably reflect systemic
microvascular damage and may be an early indicator of cardiovascular diseases. There are
some clinical studies supporting associations between retinal microvascular abnormalities
and cerebral small-vessel disease (white matter lesions, lacunar infarcts, microbleeds),48-53
ischemic cerebral infarction,54-67 coronary atherosclerotic heart disease,65, 66, 68-78 congestive
heart failure.79-81 In addition, some prospective studies suggest that retinal microvascular
abnormal signs are predictive of the subsequent risk of hypertension82-88 or diabetes89-93
independently of other known risk factors.
Although a large number of studies have reflected the association between abnormal
retinal microvascular signs and cardiovascular risk factors, some results were inconsistent
for two reasons. Firstly

，qualitative assessment of retinopathy is mainly based on the

experiences of the individual and the evaluation results lacks objectivity. Secondly, there is a
variety of methods of computer-assisted quantification of retinal vasculature, such as retinal
vessel caliber, and thus measurements given for the same fundus image often vary. Last but
not least, variations in image brightness, focus, and contrast can significantly affect the
measurement of retinal vasculature. Thus this study was designed to analyze retinal image
using convolutional neural networks (CNN), also known as convnets, a type of deep-learning
model almost universally used in computer vision applications. One fundamental
characteristic of convnets that are composed of multiple processing layers is that it can find
interesting features in the training data on its own, without any need for manual feature
engineering.94 This is especially true for problems where the input samples are very

high-dimensional, like medical images (e.g., retinal fundus image, optical coherence
tomography, radiographs, tissue section). It can detect subclinical and discrete features
appearing below the threshold of a human observer, quantify minimal differences in feature
expression and recognize patterns among large cohorts. So we trained a CNN classification
model to screen for hypertension and diabetes based on retinal fundus images.

METHODS
Data collection
The research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was reviewed by the
Committee on Medical Ethics of Shenyang He Eye Hospital. We collected 427 patients with
a diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes and 425 normotensive and non-diabetic control
subjects, who were admitted between January 2018 and December 2018 to Shenyang He
Eye Hospital with eye disease. The case group include 172 males and 255 females, mean
age 64.1 ± 9.6 years , whereas the control group was composed of 201 males and 224
females, mean age 53.2 ± 17.5 years.
Each patient underwent ophthalmological examination and standard assessments of
cardiovascular risk factors. Retinal photographs that were centred on the macula and
documented the optic disc, the macula, substantial portions of the temporal vascular
arcades were taken with 45°non-mydriatic digital camera (TRC-NW300, Topcon, Tokyo,
Japan) after dilation of the pupils with tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops. Hypertension
was defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure
above 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medication during the previous 2 weeks.

Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting blood glucose concentration above 7.0 mmol/L, a
non-fasting value of more than 11.1 mmol/L, or a self-reported history of treatment for
diabetes. Exclusion criteria were: poor dilation or ocular media opacities so that part of or the
entire retinal vessel is almost indiscernible (ie, cataracts with high-severity opacity of lens,
vitreous hemorrhage); any other previous or coexisting ocular disease that could affect the
retinal vasculature (ie, glaucoma, central or branch retinal artery occlusion, central or branch
retinal vein occlusion).
One thousand one hundred and sixty retinal photographs that include 580 from the case
group and 580 from the control group. We divided this imaging datasets into a development
dataset (1000 photos) to develop our models and test dataset (160 photos) which were not
used during the training process to assess our model’s performance. The development
dataset consist of two components: 500 images from the patients with diabetes or
hypertension and 500 images form the normotensive and non-diabetic control subjects. The
development dataset was divided into a training dataset (70%) and a validation dataset
(30%) which was a random subset of the development dataset and was not used to train the
model parameters, but was used as a small evaluation dataset for tuning the model. The test
dataset consist of two components: 80 images from the patients with diabetes or
hypertension and 80 images form the normotensive and non-diabetic control subjects.
Model development
The JPEG content was decoded to RGB grids of pixels at a size of 2048×1536 and
convert these into floating-point tensors. For pre-processing, auto-cutting was employed to
minimize black border around the field of view and yields square images, of

dimension1496×1496, in order to scale the images without distortion. All images were
resized to 256×256, and rescaled pixel values (between 0 and 255) to the [0, 1] interval. To
highlight the retinal vasculature, two image enhancement methods, gamma correction and
contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, were conducted to enhance the image
contrast (Fig. 1). In addition, another dataset was generated by converting all 3-channel
color images to the grayscale ones (Fig. 1).

Thus

，at each iteration，the model never saw the exact same picture twice. This helps

expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better.
Although data augmentation techniques were used, the inputs the model sees are still
heavily inter-correlated, because they come from a small number of original images—you
can’t produce new information, you can only remix existing information. As such, this may
not be enough to completely get rid of overfitting. To further combat overfitting, a common
and highly effective approach to deep learning on small image datasets was to use a
pretrained network that is a saved network which was previously trained on a large dataset,
typically on a large-scale image-classification task. The features learned by the pretrained
network can prove useful for many different computer-vision problems, even though these
new problems may involve completely different classes than those of the original task. In this
study, deep residual network, derived from the championship model on the ImageNet Large
Scale Visual Recognition Challenge of 2015(ILSVRC 2015) classification task, which are
substantially deeper than deep convolutional neural networks used previously and can gain
accuracy from considerably increased depth, was used for training and classification95.
Because this study is binary classification problem, we’ll use a 2-way softmax classifier
instead of the final layer with 1000 outputs and a softmax activation of the original model.
We fine-tuned the classifier and the last convolution layer of resnet50, while all the other
layers were be frozen, because layers higher up encode more-specialized features that
need to be repurposed on new problem.
The mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) was used to optimize the trainable
parameters of the resnet50. The learning rate was initialized at 0.0001 and successively

decreased to 1×10-8 of the original per iteration, and the maximum number of iterations
was 500. Momentum was used to addresses two issues with SGD : convergence speed and
local minima.
Evaluating the model
In a test phase, in order to keep the image size consistent with cropped pictures during
the training process, all testing images were resized to 225×225 and randomly extracted 1
patch of 224×224. To evaluate performances of the learned model on screening for diabetes
and hypertension based on fundus, we used precision, recall, the area under the ROC (AUC)
, the area under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR) on separate test dataset which were not
present in the development dataset.

RESULTS
First we used pre-processed 3-channel color retinal photographs to train and test model.
Kept a record of how well the model did at each epoch and plotted the loss and accuracy of
the model over the training and validation data during training (figure 2). The training
accuracy increased gradually with every iteration until it reached nearly 90.3%, while training
loss kept decreasing until it reached nearly 0.241. The training curves were closely tracking
the validation curves. The model trained at 52th epoch performed best on the test dataset
with accuracy of 69.4%, and 75.7% on train dataset, 74.4% on validation dataset. On the
test dataset, its prediction precision for diabetes or hypertension was 65.3%, and the recall
for diabetes or hypertension was 82.5%. The model achieved an AUC of 0.745, and an
AUPR of 0.742. (Table 1)

the model over the training and validation data during training (figure 3).The training
accuracy increased gradually with every iteration until it reached nearly 86.5%, while

AUC: the area under the ROC; AUPR: the area under the Precision-Recall curve

There are many factors that affect the prediction accuracy of the model on separate test
data samples, such as the hyper-parameters of the model including learning rate and
momentum, the number of frozen layers, the number of patches randomly extracted from full
image, and the size of and the proportion of patch to full image. Here are the optimal result,
the others are not listed.

Discussion
Our study show that an already trained deep learning model based on the retinal fundus
photographs alone can be used to screen for diabetes and hypertension. While not ideal,
these results suggests that retinal images form the patients with diabetes or hypertension
has distinguishing pathological features that are likely to generalize to other new images.
Substantial prior research suggests that hypertension is associated with narrower retinal
arterioles,2, 3, 5, 9-11 decreased retinal vascular fractal dimension,3, 17, 19-21 less retinal arteriolar

can detect these subclinical morphological vascular changes appearing below the threshold

Although we use strategies for mitigating overfitting and maximizing generalization,
such as data augmentation and fine-tuning, on test data, the model eventually started
over-fitting after a certain number of iterations. At the beginning of training, optimization and

generalization were correlated: the higher the accuracy on training data, the higher the
accuracy on test data. But at 53th epoch the model trained based on color retinal
photographs begin to overfit and obtain increasingly worse results on test data which it has
never seen before, while based on grayscale retinal photographs it begin to overfit at 193th
epoch and the gap between validation accuracy and test accuracy was narrower. So the
ideal model is one that was trained at 192 epochs using grayscale retinal photographs, and
at this time it stands right at the border between underfitting and overfitting. One reason for
this outcome is that we had little training data available. Another possible reason could be
that the fundus photograph contains a lot of additional information besides retinal
microvasculature and the model learns representations that are specific to the training data
but that doesn’t generalize to data outside of the training set. By converting the image to
gray scale image, the additional information other than retinal vessel was compressed to the
maximum extent and therefore the model trained using grayscale retinal photographs could
achieve superior generalization power. To prevent a model from learning misleading or
irrelevant patterns found in the training data, the best solution is to get more training data.
Yet, the acquisition cost of medical image is higher and annotations must be performed by

，and thousands of training images are usually beyond scope of
biomedical research. Next，we construct an automated segmentation models for the retinal
clinically qualified personals

vessel segmentation task based on convolutional neural networks and only retained vessel
morphology information. By implementing this methodology, a model can only learn retinal
vascular pathological features from training dataset, thereby furthest mitigate overfitting.
Although the model’s performance on screening for diabetes and hypertension is not so

ideal, our study suggest that it has certain feasibility that screening people with
cardiovascular risk factors based on retinal images using deep learning. Cardiovascular risk
factors, which include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity and so on, lead
to characteristic changes of retinal vascular morphology in fundus photograph. In the future,
we will assess large databases of subclinical cardiovascular patients who often have
multiple cardiovascular risk factors and use deep learning technique to train screening
models based on retinal photographs. So that people at high risk of cardiovascular disease
may be discovered and treated at an early stage.
