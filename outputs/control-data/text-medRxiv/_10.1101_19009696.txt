Abstract
Introduction: Change-point analyses are increasingly used to identify the temporal stages of accelerated cognitive decline in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, statistical comparisons of change-points between specific cognitive measures have not been reported.
Methods: 165 older adults (baseline age range: 61.1-91.2) from the Baltimore Longitudinal
Study of Aging developed AD during follow-up. Linear and non-linear mixed models were fit
for 11 cognitive measures to determine change-points in rates of decline before AD diagnosis.
Bootstrapping was used to compare the timing of change-points across cognitive measures.
Results: Change-points followed by accelerated decline ranged from 15.5 years (Card Rotations) to 1.9 years (Trail-Making A) before AD diagnosis. Accelerated decline in Card Rotations
occurred significantly earlier than all other measures, including learning and memory measures.
Discussion: Results suggest that visuospatial ability, as assessed by Card Rotations, may have
the greatest utility as an early predictive tool in identifying preclinical AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive
disease with a long preclinical phase in which
pathological markers are present for years
and even decades before clinical symptoms
[1]. Decline in episodic memory is a hallmark
of AD, but other cognitive domains are also
vulnerable to AD. [2] Understanding the temporal stages of the early acceleration of declines in various cognitive domains in preclinical AD is important for identifying individuals vulnerable towards accumulating AD
pathology and for characterizing AD progression prior to symptom onset.
The early preclinical phase of AD is characterized by beta amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau accumulation with subsequent acceleration of brain atrophy in the absence of
clinical symptoms. [1, 3-5] With multiple
anti-amyloid clinical trials failing to show
that removal of Aβ is associated with improved cognitive outcomes, [6] one argument
is that patients are not being targeted early
enough. [6, 7] The failures of clinical trials at
later disease stages have led to increasing focus on the earlier phases of disease, including
the asymptomatic preclinical stage, with the
hope that treatments at this stage may be
more effective. [8, 9] Thus, it is critical to define the earliest, and possibly subtle, changes
in cognitive performance in preclinical AD to
identify individuals who would have the
greatest potential to benefit from clinical interventions. To fully characterize cognitive
changes in preclinical AD, it is important to
examine a broad range of cognitive domains
and neuropsychological measures that may
be sensitive to the earliest changes.
One way of investigating the timing of cognitive decline prior to clinical AD diagnosis
is to use change-point analyses. Changepoint methods align participants by anchoring them at time of diagnosis to then examine

trajectories of variables of interest retrospectively for timepoints of change prior to clinical diagnosis. Change-points are identified
using piece-wise linear components separated by knots delineating between intervals
with differing rates of change. [10, 11] Previous studies using change-point analyses in
AD focused on verbal memory, [12, 13] reporting steeper declines in Immediate Recall,
measured by the picture version of the Free
and Cued Selective Reminding test, between
1 and 8.1 years before clinical diagnosis.
However, memory is not the only cognitive
domain subject to decline prior to AD onset
[2] and other domains have shown early
change-points. In a systematic review of
change-point studies in dementia and AD,
[14] the measure with the earliest changepoint, at 9.6 years before AD diagnosis, was
the Block design test assessing visuospatial
ability. [15] Measures associated with other
domains, i.e., language fluency and executive
function showed change-points detected at
6.8 years [16] and 2.9 years [13] prior to AD
diagnosis respectively.
While the systematic review by Karr et al.
[14] allows for a cursory comparisons of
change-points between measures associated
with various cognitive domains, the authors
highlight various methodological differences
between studies that make it difficult to draw
conclusions from such comparisons. For example, the maximum length of longitudinal
testing prior to AD diagnosis ranged from 930 years with frequency of visits varying between studies. Furthermore, the mean baseline ages in all studies ranged from 70-82
years, and analyses were adjusted by different sets of covariates. Therefore, the temporal
sequence of changes in different cognitive
domains in preclinical AD remains unclear.
To elucidate the temporal sequence of cognitive changes prior to clinical AD onset, we
investigated changes in rates of decline on
multiple cognitive measures, representing

specific cognitive domains, in individuals
who eventually developed AD. The aims of
this study were to identify how many changepoints best characterize the trajectories of
change in performance on several cognitive
measures and to find the earliest point in time
before AD diagnosis that accelerated decline
in performance could first be detected for
each measure.
Methods
Participants
Participants were from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a longitudinal study started in 1958. [17] Participants
were community-dwelling volunteers who
were healthy at enrollment. During each visit,
they received comprehensive psychological
evaluations. For this study, we selected participants who were diagnosed with AD during follow-up and only used data from visits
when they had complete neuropsychological
testing data across the 11 measures investigated.
Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease
Clinical and neuropsychological data from
each participant were reviewed at a consensus case conference if their clinical dementia
rating score [18] was 0.5 or greater or if they
had more than three errors on the Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test, [19]
and participants were evaluated by case conference upon death or withdrawal. MCI status
was determined using the Petersen criteria.
[20] Diagnoses of dementia and AD were
based on criteria outlined in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
third edition, revised [21] and the National
Institute of Neurological and Communication
Disorders and Stroke – Alzheimer’s Disease
and Related Disorders, [22] respectively.

Neuropsychological measures
Participants were administered a comprehensive battery of cognitive measures assessing
verbal learning and memory, figural memory,

attention and processing speed, executive

Here, we provide a summary of each measure
used as outcomes in the present study.
The California Verbal Learning Test
(CVLT) [23] assesses episodic verbal learning and memory. There are 5 learning trials
of 16 shopping items, presented orally, with
four items from each of four semantic categories. The sum of the five trials provides a
measure of new learning and immediate free
recall. In addition, short- and long-delayed
free recall, short- and long-delayed cued recall, and recognition memory are assessed.
The two measures used were: total number of
items recalled across the five immediate free
recall trials (CVLT-IMM), and long-delay
free recall (CVLT-LD), with maximum
scores of 80, and 16, respectively.

The Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT)
[24] measures visual constructional skill and
short-term figural memory. Participants
study 10 line-drawings, including one to
three geometric figures, for 10 seconds each,
and then immediately reproduce them from
memory using pencil and paper. The designs
become more difficult over the 10 trials. The
measure used was the total number of errors.
The Trail-Making Test Parts A (TMT-A) and
B (TMT-B) [25] assess attention, concentration, visuomotor scanning, perceptuomotor
speed, working memory, and set-shifting.
TMT-A involves drawing a line to connect
randomly arranged numbers from 1 to 25 in
sequential order. TMT-B involves connecting randomly arranged numbers and letters in
alternating sequence (e.g., 1-A-2-B . . .).
Time to completion for each test (in seconds)
was used in the present study.
Letter [26] and Category [27] Fluency are
measures of fluent language production and
executive function. Participants were given
60 seconds to generate as many words as possible beginning with specific letters and specific categories. The mean numbers of correct
words generated in 60 seconds, across the
three trials each for letter and category fluency, were the measures of interest.
The Boston Naming Test (BNT) [28] is a
measure of object recognition and semantic
retrieval. Participants identify and name a series of line drawings of objects, beginning
with common objects and ending with infrequent objects. The measure used was the
number of words out of 60 correctly named
without cues.
WAIS-R Similarities measures verbal concept formation and abstract reasoning. [29]
Participants are asked how 14 pairs of two
items are similar, starting with concrete items
and becoming increasingly abstract. The
measure of interest was the total score out of
a maximum of 28.

A modified version [30] of the Educational
Testing Service Card Rotations test was used
to measure visuospatial ability. Participants
were presented with a target figure and eight
alternative figures in the same row. Subjects
marked images that could be rotated in plane
to match the target, but not those that were
mirror image figures. The total number correct minus total number incorrect across the
two parts (14 targets per part) was the measure of interest, with a maximum score of 224.
The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)
[31] assesses mental status, including orientation to time and place, immediate and delayed recall, attention and calculation, and
language. Total score out of 30 was the measure of interest.
Statistical analyses
To find the number of change-points where
the rate of longitudinal decline changes significantly and the timing of these changepoints relative to AD diagnosis, a series of
linear and nonlinear mixed models with increasing complexity were fit with each of the
cognitive measures as the outcome and the
time (in years) to diagnosis of AD as the main
predictor. We started with a no change-point
model and then tested a one-change-point
model and finally a two change-points model.
The two-change-point model function is
given by
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝑏𝑏0𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 �𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 −
𝑐𝑐1 �+ + 𝛽𝛽3 �𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑐𝑐2 � + Ɛ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
+

where (𝑥𝑥)+ = 𝑥𝑥, 𝑥𝑥 > 0 and (𝑥𝑥)+ = 0, 𝑥𝑥 < 0.

𝑐𝑐1 is first change-point, 𝑐𝑐2 is second changepoint. 𝑏𝑏0𝑖𝑖 is a random effect that follows a
normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
deviation of σ.
All models included baseline age, sex (male
vs. female), race (white vs. non-white), and
years of education as covariates. Model selections were based on the likelihood ratio

test. The best model fit tells us how many
change-points, if any, there are for each cognitive measure.
The final model estimates were determined
by a bootstrapping method so that the parameter estimates, and standard errors can be accurately captured, and more importantly, the
timings of change-points from different

cognitive measures can be statistically compared. We used 500 randomly resampled
samples, with each sample having the same
sample size as the original one for the bootstrapping. The models were fit using PROC
NLMIXED in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

Results
Sample characteristics are shown in Table 1.
The sample consisted of 165 participants
with an AD diagnosis with a total of 988 visits. Average baseline age was 76.5 years
(standard deviation, [SD]=7.4), the average
follow-up interval was 8.3 years (SD=6.0,
range=0-24.1), and average age at AD diagnosis was 86.5 years (SD=6.1). Eighty-three
(50.3%) participants were female, and 85.5%
of the sample were white. The average years
of education was 16.7 years (SD=2.6,
range=8-21).

time (0.038 points per year, SE=0.054) to significant moderate decline in performance (0.16 points per year, SE=0.043). The second
change-point was 1.72 (SE=0.35) years before AD diagnosis, when decline accelerated
again (-0.84 points per year, SE=0.23).
Visuospatial ability
Card Rotations: The estimated first changepoint was 15.48 (SE=1.72) years before AD
diagnosis, when the trajectory transitioned
from non-significant increase in performance
over time (1.66 points per year, SE=1.59) to
significant moderate decline in performance
(-1.38 points per year, SE=0.35). The second
change-point was 4.33 (SE=1.18) years before AD diagnosis, when decline accelerated
again (-4.74 points per year, SE=1.08).
Global Cognitive Performance
MMSE: The estimated first change-point was
9.13 (SE=0.92) years before AD diagnosis,
when the trajectory transitioned from nonsignificant increase in performance over time
(-0.038 units per year, SE=0.024) to significant moderate decline in performance (-0.18
units per year, SE=0.033). The second
change-point was 1.77 (SE=0.47) years before AD diagnosis, when decline accelerated
again (-1.03 units per year, SE=0.15).
Comparing change-points across cognitive
measures
Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of
estimated change-points for each cognitive
measure. Table 4 shows the results from using bootstrapping to compare the first

change-points for each measure against all
other measures to identify the earliest changing measures. The measure with the earliest
change-point was Card Rotations, which was
significantly earlier than all other measures.
The next measure to show an early changepoint was CVLT-IMM, which was significantly earlier than CVLT-LD, BVRT, TMTA, TMT-B, BNT, and MMSE but not significantly earlier than measures of verbal fluency, or Similarities. The measure to show
the latest change-point in relation to AD diagnosis was TMT-A. Supplemental Table 1
shows the results from using bootstrapping to
compare the second change-points for each
measure. The second change-point for Card
Rotations was not significantly earlier than
the second change-points for CVLT
measures.
Discussion
In a sample of participants with consensus diagnoses of clinical AD, we used extensive
longitudinal cognitive data to examine the
temporal sequence of stages of decline in 11
cognitive measures. Change-points identifying steeper rates of cognitive decline ranged
from 15.5 years before AD diagnosis for the
Card Rotations test to 1.9 years before AD diagnosis for TMT-A. While episodic memory
assessed by CVLT measures was not the domain to show the earliest changes in rates of
decline, changes were still detected up to 11.7
years before AD diagnosis. Using changepoint analyses in this way can reveal the temporal ordering of domain-specific accelerated
decline in preclinical AD.
The change-point for Card Rotations (15.5
years before AD diagnosis) was significantly
earlier than change-points for all other cognitive measures, including CVLT measures of
episodic memory. This extends previous
findings from a systematic review [14] in
which it was casually observed that

visuospatial ability shows the earliest acceleration of cognitive decline prior to AD.
The underlying mechanisms that may lead to
early accelerated decline in visuospatial ability in preclinical AD may be understood from
the roles of the precuneus and other parietal
regions in visuospatial tasks that involve spatial manipulation (as is the case with the Card
Rotations Task in BLSA). [32] The precuneus is also part of a large network that includes medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe
regions that support spatial navigation. [33]
The precuneus is one of the earliest brain regions to show accumulation of Aβ in preclinical AD [34, 35] and deficits in spatial navigation are one of the earliest impairments
leading to loss of independence. Taken together, the functional importance of the
precuneus in visuospatial processing and its
susceptibility to early AD pathology support
our finding that visuospatial ability would be
affected early in preclinical AD.
CVLT-IMM showed the second earliest
change-point at 11.7 years before diagnosis.
This change was significantly earlier than
CVLT-LD, which had a change-point at 7.6
years before AD diagnosis. The difference
between change-points for CVLT-IMM and
CVLT-LD is consistent with previous studies
that reported faster rates of verbal learning
compared to delayed free recall declines at
earlier stages of disease progression, [36, 37]
and confirms the importance of early learning
deficits in detecting individuals at risk of developing AD. [38] However, change-points
for CVLT-IMM were not significantly earlier
than those for measures of verbal fluency, the
Similarities Test, or the MMSE, suggesting
that some aspects of executive function, i.e.,
verbal concept formation and abstract reasoning, as well as aspects of mental status may
exhibit changes in the rates of decline as early
as some memory-based learning tasks. These
results contrast with earlier reports using
BLSA data indicating that memory is

affected earlier than executive function. [13]
One possible explanation for the different
pattern of results in the present analysis is the
larger number of participants with longer follow-up compared to previous reports.
Every cognitive measure examined showed
at least one change-point, with the majority
of measures exhibiting two change-points. In
measures with two change points, the first
change-point was always more than five
years before diagnosis while the second
change-point was less than five years before
diagnosis and was followed by even faster
rates of decline than the first change-point.
The second change-points appear to represent
the transition from preclinical AD to MCI.
The mean time between symptom onset of
MCI and AD diagnosis in our sample was 2.5
(SD=1.8) years. Accelerated cognitive declines in the years immediately prior to symptom onset and AD diagnosis are consistent
with other reports that MCI participants show
raster rates of decline compared to healthy
controls for a range of cognitive domains including memory, executive function, attention and verbal fluency. [39]
The temporal ordering of the first and second
change-points across cognitive measures
were similar. However, the second changepoint for Card Rotations was not significantly
earlier than the second change-points for
measures of memory or fluency, suggesting
that there is little difference in the sensitivity
of these measures as the time to diagnosis becomes shorter. As noted by Grober et al. [13]
the temporal unfolding of cognitive decline
identified by change-point studies implies
that the predictive utility of different
measures would be expected to vary by time
from AD diagnosis. As such, the temporal ordering of change-points in the present study
would suggest that measures of visuospatial
ability and memory may serve as predictive
tools for the development of AD as much as
15 years before diagnosis with other

measures becoming more relevant closer to
diagnosis. However, some measures of processing speed, i.e., TMT-A, may only have
predictive utility less than five years before
diagnosis, during a period when MCI may already be detectible. This interpretation is supported by previous reports of the predictive
power of different cognitive measures. [40]
A limitation of this study is that BLSA participants are a highly educated group, which
may limit generalizability. Additionally, the
focus of this study was on defining and comparing population-level change-points and as
such we did not examine individual differences in the timing of change-points which
requires longer follow-up at the individual
level. Future work is needed to assess individual differences in change-points. However, the strengths of this study are the comprehensive cognitive battery, frequent visit
schedule (subjects were tested annually or biannually in this sample) and consensus-based
determination of symptom onset and AD
diagnosis. In addition, the use of the bootstrapping analysis not only allows us to capture parameter estimates and standard errors
more accurately, but enables the statistical
comparison of change-points among different cognitive measures, greatly extending the
work of previous studies. [14]
In summary, we found that the cognitive
measure to show the earliest change in rates
of decline in preclinical AD was visuospatial
ability rather than episodic memory. Using
change-point analyses with bootstrapping
can reveal the temporal patterns of accelerated cognitive decline in preclinical AD and
may help guide the development of tools for
participant screening in clinical trials.
