ABSTRACT
The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue, a mosquito-borne
viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and
subtropical world. Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with
no prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV) experience an elevated risk of severe
disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination. As a result
of these findings, guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior
to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category.
These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is
expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission. One important practical
difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV
transmission is spatially heterogeneous, even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks
within a city. This raises the question of whether models based on data that average
over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of
CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations. We explored this question
with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a
population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities.
Compared to the full model, a version of the model based on the average of the two
communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the hightransmission community, which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we
observed under even coverage. In addition, the model based on the average of the two
communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the
low-transmission community. In the event that the specificity of serological screening is
not high, this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could
overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population.

INTRODUCTION
Dengue is a viral, mosquito-borne disease caused by any of four dengue virus (DENV)
serotypes that are transmitted among people by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus
mosquitoes (1). While any of the four DENV serotypes may cause disease, an
individual’s second infection, regardless of DENV serotype, carries an enhanced risk of
causing severe disease (2; 3). This can result in hemorrhagic fever, hospitalization, and,
in some cases, death (1). Due to the widespread distribution of its mosquito vectors (4;
5) dengue has been estimated to pose a risk to a large fraction of the world's
population, both now and in the future (6).
Despite the compelling need for a vaccine against dengue (7), only one dengue
vaccine (CYD-TDV, or Dengvaxia, by Sanofi Pasteur) has been licensed to date. The
rollout of this vaccine has been controversial (8), given that it has been associated with
an elevated risk of severe disease for individuals who experience their first natural
DENV infection at some point after being vaccinated (9). As a result, the Strategic
Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommends that CYD-TDV only
be administered to individuals with known prior DENV exposure (10). It is generally
accepted that pre-vaccination serological screening is required to determine whether
individuals meet this criterion (8). As such, we refer to the combination of serological
screening and–in the event of a positive screening result–vaccination as the
"intervention."
There are three considerations that affect the public health impact of CYD-TDV
vaccination following positive serological screening, each of which depends on baseline
seroprevalence in the population being vaccinated. First, it is essential that screening
have high specificity to avoid harm to seronegative individuals who should not be
vaccinated, particularly in areas with low baseline seroprevalence (11). Second, it is
also important that screening have high sensitivity to ensure that seropositive
individuals benefit from vaccination, particularly in areas with high baseline
seroprevalence (12). Third, an assay for serological screening with a given sensitivity
and specificity is expected to have greater impact in an area with higher baseline
seroprevalence, due to the higher proportion of seropositive individuals and the greater
benefits of herd immunity in these settings (13). For these reasons, baseline
seroprevalence could influence decisions about which screening assay is most
appropriate in a given setting, or whether vaccination with CYD-TDV is appropriate in
the first place.
One major complication to the formulation of policies for CYD-TDV vaccination is
the fact that baseline seroprevalence can vary considerably across space (14). Among
districts within a country, estimates of seroprevalence among nine-year-olds varied from
below 20% to above 80% across departments in Colombia and states in Mexico, due to
subnational variability in environmental drivers of transmission (11). Even below the
level of a city, baseline seroprevalence can vary across neighborhoods or blocks. DENV
seroprevalence ranged 56-77% across neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (15),
74-91% across neighborhoods of Recife, Brazil (16), 67-90% across neighborhoods in
Iquitos, Peru (17), and 21-100% between adjacent blocks in Maracay, Venezuela (18).
Drivers of variability in DENV seroprevalence at this spatial scale can include a number
of factors associated with socioeconomic differences, such as housing quality, free-

standing water, open containers, and infrequent waste removal (19; 20; 21; 22).
In the event that the spatial resolution of DENV seroprevalence estimates to
inform CYD-TDV policy is limited to larger administrative scales (11), there is a risk that
such policies may not be well-suited to constituent areas where seroprevalence is
above or below average. Under the assumption of uniform seroprevalence, CYD-TDV
implementation could pose a greater risk of severe disease in areas where
seroprevalence is below average. Conversely, assuming uniform seroprevalence could
lead to underestimates of the benefits from vaccination in areas of higher than average
seroprevalence. Another possibility is that individuals from low-transmission
communities could benefit indirectly from vaccination in high-transmission communities
(23). Yet another complication is that vaccination coverage could vary spatially. In urban
areas of Brazil, vaccination coverage has been found to be both negatively (24) and
positively (25) associated with socioeconomic status, due to differences in access to
vaccination and willingness to vaccinate across socioeconomic strata.
To date, mathematical models of CYD-TDV impact have mostly assumed that
transmission is spatially homogeneous within the population being modeled (26). This
leaves an important gap in understanding the implications of uniform policies for CYDTDV vaccination in areas comprised of communities with unrecognized spatial
heterogeneity in baseline DENV seroprevalence. To explore these implications, we
developed and analyzed a simple two-patch model of DENV transmission based on a
system of ordinary differential equations. Transmission potential and baseline
seroprevalence differed between these hypothetical communities, and routine
vaccination with CYD-TDV following serological screening in nine-year-olds was
simulated over a thirty-year horizon. We examined differences in the proportion of cases
averted among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in both communities, including
under differing assumptions about human mobility and uneven vaccination coverage.
METHODS
Model Description
Overview

Our model tracks the transmission dynamics of DENV in two communities indexed by c.
These communities, h and l, are differentiated by their respective high and low
and  . They are coupled by human mobility, with
transmission coefficients,
individuals in susceptible classes assumed to spend a fraction, H, of their time in the
community in which they reside and the rest of their time, 1-H, in the other community.
Our model also included demographic change, as we are interested in modeling
transmission over several decades. This includes a year-specific birth rate, μt, year- and
age-specific death rate, δt,a, and progression through age classes 0-80+, indexed by a.
Rather than track all four DENV serotypes explicitly (something very few DENV
transmission models do, (27)), our model stratifies individuals by how many DENV
serotypes, s, they have been infected by. Individuals are further classified with respect
to their status as susceptible, infected, or recovered within each community and age
class, resulting in state variables Sc,a,s, Ic,a,s, and Rc,a,s. Individuals in different s strata
experience different probabilities of symptomatic disease,  . As assumed by other
models examining CYD-TDV impacts on DENV transmission (28), we incremented s by

Demography
Our model tracked ages in one-year increments from zero to 79, and individuals aged
80 or older were binned into a single group. Transitions into ages one to 80+ occurred
at a daily rate of Ga = 365-1. Transitions out of ages zero to 79 occurred at rate  =
365-1, while individuals in the terminal age class of 80+ years remained there until
death. Births occurred at year-specific, daily rate μt per capita, which was multiplied by
total population Nc(t) to obtain the overall rate at which newborns entered community c
through the Sc,0,1 compartment. Deaths occurred at year- and age-specific, daily rate δt,a
for individuals in all states. The background death rate, δt,a, was assumed to adequately
capture the small proportion of DENV infections that resulted in death. Although our
model was not designed with a specific population in mind, we used birth and death
rates from Brazil (31) given that it is a large, dengue-endemic country that has been the
subject of CYD-TDV modeling before (13; 26). To ground our analysis in contemporary
demographic rates, we assumed that CYD-TDV vaccination began in 2020, meaning
that the model burn-in period began in 1960 and that vaccination impacts were tracked
until 2050. Over the course of this timeframe, birth rate decreased more than four-fold
(Fig. 2A), and child mortality decreased while mortality among older ages increased
(Fig. 2B).

DENV transmission
Like most models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission (33), we did not explicitly
incorporate mosquitoes into our model. Instead, the contribution of mosquitoes to DENV
V
transmission was implicitly captured by transmission coefficients, βh and βl. Within each
h
community, we assumed that human-mosquito encounters were well-mixed and
homogeneous, consistent with standard assumptions for ODE models. Between
communities, we assumed that residents of one community spent a proportion, 1-H, of
their time in the other community and were, therefore, subject to the force of DENV
infection in that community during that time. Rather than model DENV serotypes
explicitly, we assumed that the force of DENV infection was proportional to
4-s, or the number of serotypes to which an individual had not yet been exposed.
Individuals progressed through their period of active infection – and infectiousness to
ity
mosquitoes – at rate γ before progressing through a period of temporary cross-immunity
at rate σ.
Dengue pathogenesis
Although the risk of severe disease is typically considered an important consideration
for models of CYD-TDV vaccination impact, we limited our model to two types of
infection: asymptomatic or symptomatic. Symptomatic and severe disease are often
assumed to be highest among secondary infections, second highest among primary
lts
infections, and lowest among post-secondary infections (34). Hence, our model's results
about symptomatic disease may mirror what patterns of severe disease would be, had
we modeled them.

To parameterize the proportion of infections that result in symptomatic disease
as a function of s,  , we adopted values used in a model by the Hopkins/UF team in
Flasche et al. (2016) (Table 1). We also adopted their assumption that symptomatic
infections are twice as infectious to mosquitoes as asymptomatic infections, despite
substantial uncertainty around that multiplier (35). We chose to adopt values from this
model due to its similarity to our model's structure and its general consistency with
seven other models of CYD-TDV vaccination impact (26).
CYD-TDV vaccination
In this analysis, we examined impacts of routine vaccination of nine-year-olds following
a positive result from serological screening. For those in the Sc,9,0 state, vaccination
occurred at rate vc (1 – spec). For those in the Sc,9,1+, Ic,9,1+, or Rc,9,1+ states, vaccination
occurred at rate vc sens. Vaccinated individuals from the Sc,9,s, Ic,9,s, and Rc,9,s states

then moved to state ,,
. Then, they experienced a period of temporary crossimmunity to other DENV serotypes until they transitioned at rate σ to the appropriate

,,
or Sc,a,s+1 state.
Given our assumption that vaccination acts as a silent natural infection, there
was no need for a parameter to describe protection afforded by vaccination, other than
through the changes that result in rates of dengue pathogenesis as a consequence of s
being incremented. For serological screening prior to vaccination, we assumed a test
with sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.85 given the widely held view that both
sensitivity and specificity would need to be high for CYD-TDV to have a positive impact
(36). We held intervention coverage across the population as a whole at 50%, with that
number reflecting a weighted average across two equally sized communities that each
had intervention coverage ranging 0-100% across a range of scenarios that we
considered. To explore the possible influence of a known trade-off between sensitivity
and specificity in current DENV screening tests (37), we carried out additional analyses
in which we varied specificity from 0 to 1 to identify the minimum value necessary to
maintain positive benefits of the intervention.
Model equations
The aforementioned assumptions yielded the following equations that define the ODE
model. Equations are presented in reference to community c, with the other community
denoted as c’.

proportion of time H spent in each by a resident of c. Because individuals in this

Calibration
Following Flasche et. al (26), we used seroprevalence of nine-year-olds (SP9) as a
proxy for DENV transmission intensity. Transmission coefficients were chosen to
generate an SP9 of 20% in the low-transmission community and an SP9 of 80% in the
high-transmission community. When both communities were evaluated together, this
yielded an SP9 of 50%. This relatively wide range in SP9 was chosen purposefully, so
as to explore the effects of a wide range in transmission intensities within a single,
interconnected community. In particular, we chose a lower value of 20% so that a
community in which CYD-TDV might possibly have a negative impact was considered.
and  that would yield the desired values of SP9 in the
To identify values of
two communities, we solved the system of ODEs for sixty years under 100 different
combinations of transmission coefficients for each community spanning a 10x10 grid of
0-0.2 for  and 0.2-0.3 for . To allow for interpolation between these values, we
estimated the relationships between ,  , and SP9 using thin-plate splines. Values of
and  yielding values of SP9 of 20% and 80%, respectively, under mobility and nomobility scenarios are provided in Table 1. Code for this calibration process is available
at https://github.com/mwalte10/intra-urban_dengue_vaccination_impact/calibration.R.
Analyses
We assessed the impacts of CYD-TDV vaccination by quantifying two metrics,
proportion of cases averted and force of infection, described below. We did so
separately in the two communities under scenarios with and without mobility and across
varying levels of coverage allocated between the communities. We also performed the
same calculations for a single, well-mixed community with SP9 = 0.5, which was
intermediate between that of the low- (0.2) and high-transmission (0.8) communities.
Force of infection
To quantify the effects of the intervention on the overall dynamics of DENV
transmission, we examined force of infection before and after introduction of CYD-TDV.
We calculated force of infection as the rate at which susceptible people became
infected on an annual basis, which corresponded to a weighted average of the first term
in eqns. (2) and (6) across all a and s but stratified by c and c'.
Proportion of cases averted
Following previous work (13; 26), we used the proportion of symptomatic cases averted
to quantify the impacts of CYD-TDV vaccination from a public health perspective.
Negative values indicated an increase in cases, while positive values indicated a
decrease. We applied this metric to vaccinated and unvaccinated populations
separately to allow for the effects of direct and indirect protection to be assessed.

Because there is no corresponding group of vaccinated individuals in the model with no
o
vaccination, we calculated the proportion of symptomatic cases averted by comparing
equivalent fractions of age groups that were subject to vaccination in the model with
vaccination.
RESULTS
Model validation
We compared the proportion of cases averted under our model to that under models
used by Flasche et al. (26) at five baseline seroprevalence levels (10%, 30%, 50%,
70%, and 90%). As a function of baseline seroprevalence, the pattern of cases averted
under our model was qualitatively similar to that under the other models (Fig. 3).
Specifically, our model captured the same overall trend between baseline
e
seroprevalence and cases averted and also predicted a switch from negative to positive
cases averted as baseline seroprevalence increased from 10% to 30% (Fig. 3).
Whereas this version of our model did not involve pre-vaccination screening (to be
comparable to models used at the time by Flasche et al. (26)), the version of our model
used to generate all subsequent results did involve pre-vaccination screening.

our model to the range of predictions from eight models from Flasche et al. (26) across

the specificity and sensitivity of pre-vaccination screening. The highest vaccination
coverage was achieved in the high-transmission community when 100% of the
intervention was allocated there (Fig. 4). Under this scenario, 65.6% of the vaccinationeligible population in the high-transmission community was vaccinated. The lowtransmission community generally had much lower vaccination coverage, with a peak of
14.9% coverage when 100% of the intervention was allocated there. In a version of the
h
model with a single community with SP9 = 0.5, vaccination coverage was 21.2%, which
was similar to vaccination coverage in the overall population when the intervention was
allocated evenly across the two communities (Fig. 4).

Figure 4. Dependence of vaccination coverage on intervention coverage.
Vaccination coverage in each community (HT: high-transmission, LT: low-transmission)
and the overall population (colored lines) was a function of intervention coverage in
each community (x-axis), as well as the sensitivity and specificity of serological

screening and seroprevalence among nine-year-olds, SP9 (fixed at default values). The
+ symbol indicates vaccination coverage in a single community with SP9 equal to the
average of that of the low- and high-transmission communities.
Vaccination lowered the force of infection (FOI) in both communities, regardless
of our assumptions about mobility (Fig. 5). When we assumed that there was no
se
mobility between the two communities (Fig. 5A), each experienced its greatest decrease
in FOI when it experienced higher intervention coverage. When we assumed that there
was a modest degree of mobility between the two communities (Fig. 5B), both
experienced greater decreases in FOI when intervention coverage was higher in the
high-transmission community. This demonstrates that vaccination in the highg
transmission community indirectly benefits the low-transmission community by reducing
FOI there. Comparing the scenarios with and without mobility, the low-transmission

community showed greater differences between these two scenarios than did the hightransmission community (Fig. 5), which was a result of transmission dynamics in the
low-transmission community being primarily driven by the high-transmission community
when there was mobility between the two communities. In a version of the model with a
single community with SP9 = 0.5, the proportional reduction in force of infection was
6.0%, which was greater than in the high-transmission community but less than in the
low-transmission community when the intervention was allocated evenly (Fig. 5).

Figure 5. Proportional reduction in force of infection as a function of the
allocation of intervention coverage across low- and high-transmission
communities. Reductions are in reference to a baseline scenario with no intervention
and are presented under scenarios in which the two communities (HT: highh
transmission, LT: low-transmission) were or were not assumed to be connected through
human mobility. The + symbol indicates the proportional reduction in force of infection in
a single community with SP9 equal to the average of that of the low- and hightransmission communities.
Vaccination impact in the absence of mobility
When the two communities were not connected through mobility, each experienced its
greatest benefit from vaccination when it received 100% of the intervention (Fig. 6A).
This mirrored reductions in FOI observed when each community received higher
coverage (Fig. 5A). The population at large, however, experienced its greatest benefit
when nearly 100% of the intervention was allocated to the high-transmission community
(Fig. 6A). This is a result of the fact that the majority of infections occurred in that
community. Because most of the population was unvaccinated, these trends for the
overall population also applied to the unvaccinated population (Fig. 6C).

of intervention coverage across the two communities (x-axis) (HT: high-transmission,
LT: low-transmission) and broken down by vaccination status (columns) and community

community with SP9 equal to the average of that of the low- and high-transmission
communities.
Vaccinated individuals in a given community experienced their greatest benefit
when 100% of the intervention was allocated to their home community (Fig. 6B). In the
low-transmission community in particular, this was a consequence of our assumption off
effective pre-vaccination screening, which ensured that the vaccine mostly went to
those who stood to benefit from it (i.e., those for whom s > 0). The vaccinated
individuals in the high-transmission community benefited more than those in the lowtransmission community, because there were more individuals there for whom it was
appropriate to receive CYD-TDV (Fig. 4). The two communities benefited equally when
s
79% of the intervention was allocated to the high-transmission community and 21% was
allocated to the low-transmission community. Under different transmission parameters,
we expect that this same pattern would hold but that the numerical values would differ.
One likely possibility for how the intervention might be deployed in practice is
with even coverage across the two communities. Under this scenario, our model
predicted that 6.6% of cases would be averted in the high-transmission community and
8.5% in the low-transmission community (Fig. 6A). Across the combination of the two
communities, this amounted to an 11.7% reduction in the proportion of cases averted
compared with the optimal scenario in which the intervention was allocated in a 79:21
ratio between the high- and low-transmission communities, respectively (Fig. 6A).
s
Among all individuals, the proportion of cases averted when the intervention was
allocated evenly across the two communities was slightly lower than in a single
community with SP9 = 0.5 (Fig. 6A). This was driven primarily by a higher proportion of
cases averted among unvaccinated individuals in that community (Fig. 6C). In contrast,
the single community with SP9 = 0.5 experienced a lower proportion of cases averted
among vaccinated individuals (Fig. 6B).

Vaccination impact in the presence of mobility
When the two communities were connected through mobility, the high-transmission
community experienced its greatest benefit from vaccination when it received 100% of
the intervention (Fig. 7A). The low-transmission community experienced its greatest
benefit when it received 16% intervention coverage, at the expense of intervention
coverage in the high-transmission community only being 84%. Compared to the
scenario with 0% intervention coverage, increasing intervention coverage to 16% in the
low-transmission community increased the proportion of cases averted there by only
0.2% (Fig. 7A). Because most of the population was unvaccinated, these trends for the
overall population also applied to the unvaccinated population (Fig. 7C).

Figure 7. Proportion of cases averted under an assumption of mobility between
the two communities. Results are a presented as a function of the allocation of
intervention coverage across the two communities (x-axis) (HT: high-transmission, LT:
low-transmission) and broken down by vaccination status (columns) and community of
residence (color). The + symbol indicates the proportion of cases averted in a single
community with SP9 equal to the average of that of the low- and high-transmission
communities.
Vaccinated individuals in a given community experienced their greatest benefit
when 100% of the intervention was allocated to their home community (Fig. 6E). This
benefit amounted to 9.3% of cases averted in the high-transmission community and
2.6% of cases averted in the low-transmission community. Whereas reducing
e
intervention coverage from 100% to 0% in the high-transmission community lowered the
proportion of cases averted among vaccinated individuals there to nearly zero, reducing
g
intervention coverage from 100% to 0% in the low-transmission community resulted in
only a modest reduction in the proportion of cases averted among vaccinated
individuals there (Fig. 7B).
Under the scenario of even intervention coverage across the two communities,

there were considerably fewer cases averted in both the high- and low-transmission
communities than under the scenario in which 100% of the intervention was allocated to
the high-transmission community (Fig. 7A). Compared to the scenario with 100% of the
intervention allocated to the low-transmission community, the scenario of even
intervention coverage led to considerably more cases averted. Because most of the
cases in the overall population derived from the high-transmission community, relative
impacts of even and uneven intervention coverage scenarios for the overall population
were similar to those for the high-transmission community (Fig. 7A).
Among all individuals, the proportion of cases averted when the intervention was
allocated evenly across the two communities was slightly lower than in a single
community with SP9 = 0.5 (Fig. 7A). This was driven primarily by a higher proportion of
cases averted among unvaccinated individuals in that community (Fig. 7C). In contrast,
the single community with SP9 = 0.5 experienced a lower proportion of cases averted
among vaccinated individuals (Fig. 7B).
Sensitivity analyses
Changes in the distribution of the overall population across the two communities
resulted in modest, readily interpretable changes in our results about vaccination impact
(Fig. 8). First, the proportion of cases averted in the high-transmission community was
largely unaffected by whether more people resided there or in the low-transmission
community (Fig. 8, purple lines across columns). Second, the proportion of cases
averted in the low-transmission community was somewhat more sensitive to changes in
the distribution of the population across the two communities (Fig. 8, yellow lines across
columns), with the optimal intervention coverage in the low-transmission community
being higher when a larger fraction of the overall population resided there. These first
two observations can be explained by the fact that transmission in the low-transmission
community was much more sensitive to the high-transmission community than the
reverse. Third, the proportion of cases averted in the overall population more closely
resembled the proportion of cases averted in whichever community had the larger
population. This was primarily a consequence of how heavily the population-wide
average was weighted by one community or the other.

Changes in the specificity of pre-vaccination screening had a substantial
influence on our results about vaccination impact (Fig. 9). Sensitivity of the proportion of
cases averted to screening specificity was greatest among vaccinated individuals, with
extremely low values of specificity resulting in a negative proportion of cases averted in
both low- and high-transmission communities (Fig. 9C & 9D). These effects did differ
somewhat across the two communities though, with the decline in the proportion of
cases averted associated with lower values of specificity being much steeper in the low16

transmission community (compare spacing between lines in Fig. 9C & 9D). The
proportion of cases averted among unvaccinated individuals was also sensitive to
screening specificity, but mostly in the low-transmission community (Fig. 9C). This was
a consequence of there being lower seropositivity among potential vaccine recipients in
the low-transmission community, which meant that lower values of screening specificity
had a greater impact on vaccination coverage there than in the high-transmission
community.

DISCUSSION
Although other models that feature spatial transmission heterogeneity (38; 39; 40; 41)
have been used to project CYD-TDV vaccination impact (26), our study is the first to
directly assess the influence of spatial transmission heterogeneity on projections of
CYD-TDV vaccination impact. To ensure that our model's behavior was comparable to
that of other models, we compared its predictions about vaccination impact to
predictions from eight other models (26) that influenced the WHO's initial policy
recommendation about this vaccine (8), finding comparability between our model and
these others in key respects. Our model's behavior was also sensible in that vaccination
coverage in each community depended on the seropositivity of vaccinees in each (11),
and reductions in force of infection mirrored increases in vaccination coverage. Based
on these results, we deemed our model suitable for making an initial, theoretical
assessment of the impacts of CYD-TDV vaccination in a spatially heterogeneous
population.
In the event that two or more communities are relatively isolated from one
another (e.g., cities within a state), our results based on a model with no mobility
indicate that each community would benefit maximally if 100% of the intervention were
targeted to itself. From the perspective of the overall population (i.e., the state as a
whole rather than each city), targeting the intervention to the community with the highest
transmission would have the greatest impact. In the event that two or more communities
experience an appreciable degree of coupling (e.g., neighborhoods within a city), our
results based on a model with mobility indicate that targeting the intervention to the
community with the highest transmission would have the greatest impact, both from the
perspective of the overall population and from the perspective of each community.
Given that spatial coupling has been found to be important for DENV transmission at
multiple spatial scales (42; 43; 44; 45), taken together, our results suggest that spatial
targeting could enhance the impact of vaccination with CYD-TDV following prevaccination screening. Doing so successfully would require overcoming a number of
challenges to implementation, including more spatially detailed estimates of DENV
seropositivity (22; 46) and more accurate assays for serological screening (47).
Because spatial targeting might not always be feasible, we also considered a
scenario involving even intervention coverage across the two communities. Based on a
model with no mobility, intervention impact under even coverage was only slightly
suboptimal from the perspective of the overall population. Based on a model with
mobility, however, intervention impact under even coverage was considerably less than
under the optimal scenario of targeting the intervention exclusively on the hightransmission community. Moreover, from the perspective of vaccinated individuals, even
intervention coverage across the two communities was always suboptimal, as it reduced
vaccination coverage among seropositive individuals in the high-transmission
community who would have benefited from vaccination (9). At the same time, impact
under even intervention coverage was considerably higher than under scenarios in
which the intervention was allocated preferentially to the low-transmission community.
Due to the possibility that socioeconomic factors could underlie a coupling between
heterogeneities (48) in DENV transmission (19; 20; 21; 22) and access to dengue

vaccines (24; 25; 49), it will be important for measures to be taken to ensure that
coverage of CYD-TDV following pre-vaccination screening is no less than even, if not
targeted preferentially to communities that contribute disproportionately to transmission.
Projections of CYD-TDV vaccination impact to date have mostly assumed even
coverage in a population in which transmission is spatially homogeneous (12). Agentbased models have been an exception in that they have usually accounted for spatial
heterogeneity to some extent, although they too have neglected the issue of uneven
coverage and have incorporated spatial heterogeneity in ways that are complicated and
highly specific to a given location (38; 39; 40; 41). Comparison of versions of our model
with and without spatial heterogeneity offers simple and straightforward intuition about
whether ignoring spatial heterogeneity might lead to bias in CYD-TDV impact
projections. Overall, our results indicate that models based on a single, spatially
homogeneous population may produce reasonable projections of impact in a spatially
heterogeneous population under even intervention coverage. At the same time, we did
observe tendencies for the model based on a single population to project higher impact
in unvaccinated individuals and lower impact in vaccinated individuals than did the
model based on spatially heterogeneous communities. Most significantly though,
ignoring spatial heterogeneity led to substantial overestimation of impact in vaccinated
individuals in the low-transmission community, which is problematic given safety
concerns about CYD-TDV in seronegative individuals (9; 50). Combined with indications
from our sensitivity analysis that low screening specificity could lead to an increase in
cases among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community, this suggests
that there may be scenarios in which models assuming spatial homogeneity predict
positive impacts that are, in reality, negative for a segment of the population.
Although the relatively simple model that we used here is conducive to the
development of intuition about the influence of spatial heterogeneity on CYD-TDV
vaccination impact, it leaves open a number of questions about this issue under more
realistic circumstances. To begin to address these questions, we performed two sets of
sensitivity analyses. The first indicated that a model with uneven population distribution
across high- and low-transmission communities would behave similar to our model with
even population distribution except that the weighting of impact across the two
communities would follow the distribution of population across the two communities.
The second indicated that impact in the low-transmission community was more
sensitive to the specificity of serological screening than was impact in the hightransmission community, although the allocation of intervention coverage across the two
communities also affected the sensitivity of vaccination impact to the specificity of
serological screening. Even so, the generality of our results would best be assessed
through understanding of the extent to which our conclusions hold when analyzed in a
similar fashion by other models in more realistic settings. Similar follow-up analyses
have occurred from the perspective of estimating CYD-TDV cost-effectiveness (51; 52;
53). One way that this could be achieved in practice is if future studies involving models
of CYD-TDV vaccination impact were to perform sensitivity analyses on the issue of
spatial heterogeneity in DENV transmission.
In practice, the spatial scale at which decisions about CYD-TDV vaccination will
be made may be as coarse as a country or the first administrative level within a country
(e.g., state, province) (46). Given that DENV transmission is typified by spatial

heterogeneity below those scales (15; 16; 17; 18; 22), our results are pertinent to future
modeling projections of the impact of CYD-TDV vaccination policies at those scales.
Although we have shown that projections ignoring spatial heterogeneity may provide
reasonably accurate insights about overall impact under even intervention coverage,
there are other, potentially serious, limitations of those approaches. First, in the event
that there is capacity to target the intervention to high-transmission communities,
models that ignore spatial heterogeneity will underestimate impact. Second, in the event
that socioeconomic drivers or other factors result in unintentional targeting of lowtransmission communities, models that ignore spatial heterogeneity will overestimate
impact. Third, even in the event of even intervention coverage, models that ignore
spatial heterogeneity could substantially overestimate impact, or even overlook the
potential for harm, among vaccinated individuals in low-transmission communities.
Further developments in modeling and additional collection and sharing of fine-scale
spatial data will be important for addressing these issues and maximizing the potential
benefits of this dengue vaccine, and potentially others that come after it (36; 54).
