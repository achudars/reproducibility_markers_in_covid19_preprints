Abstract

24

Lung cancer is the cause of a fourth of all cancer related deaths. About a third of all lung

25

adenocarcinoma tumours harbour mutations on exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the epidermal growth

26

factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Patients having these mutations are treated with EGFR Tyrosine

27

kinase inhibitors and show better clinical outcomes. Detection of these mutations must be both

28

accurate and timely. We utilized malignant pleural effusions for EGFR mutation detection. We

29

started with a direct sequencing approach and detected a common exon 19 deletion. We then

30

attempted to test the sensitivity of this method by sequencing this sample diluted with wildtype

31

DNA. While signatures of this large deletion were detectable even in a 1 part mutant and 99 part

32

wildtype mixture, this method was going to limit our ability to detect single base pair mutations

33

confidently from pleural effusions. We then tried a EGFR mutant-specific quantitative polymerase

34

chain reaction (PCR) based assay on n=10 pleural effusion samples (1 non-malignant pleural

35

effusion as an internal negative control). 5/9 (55.55%) samples harboured EGFR mutations with

36

2/9 (22.22%) being exon 19 deletions and 3/9 (33.33%) had the S768I exon 20 mutation. These

37

data suggest malignant pleural effusions may be a utilized to detect mutations even before a biopsy

38

is made available. The high rate of S768I mutations seen in our study suggests that cancer cells

39

harbouring these mutations may be superior in their ability to migrate, home or reside in pleural

40

fluid.

Introduction

47

Lung cancer is a major contributor to death due to cancer. Amongst the various types of lung

48

cancer, the non-small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 80% of all cases 1. In India, a

49

significant rise has been seen in the time trends of lung cancer in Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore.

50

Lung cancer is the cause of 6.9 percent of all new cancer cases and 9.3 percent of all cancer related

51

deaths in both men and women in India2. Mutations seen on Exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the

52

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are frequently observed in these cases and have

53

been shown to be present in nearly a third of all lung adenocarcinoma cases 3-5. Epidermal growth

54

factor receptor (EGFR) is a family member of receptor tyrosine kinases and play a central role in

55

cellular signalling which promote cell growth and proliferation. Some mutations in this protein

56

strongly predict the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors used in the treatment of these cases. There are

57

reportedly more than 32 different mutations that have been detected in EGFR gene, and are

58

distributed across the 4 exons namely, 18, 19, 20, and 21 6, 7. More than 20 different in-frame

59

deletions on exon 19 have been reported accounting for nearly half of the cases of EGFR mutant

60

lung adenocarcinoma. Importantly, tumours harbouring these deletions are found to be sensitive

61

to EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib and gefitinib8. This targeted therapy has been found to increase

62

clinical outcomes in these patients9. It is imperative that such mutations are diagnosed accurately

63

and early for the benefit of patients.

64
65

Response rates of more than 70 percent have been observed in patients on EGFR targeted

66

therapy10. Patients with EGFR mutant positive advanced NSCLC treated with Erlotinib, an EGFR

67

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) have shown better response rates and Progression-free survival

68

(PFS) as compared to those on first line chemotherapeutic agents11-14.

69

Diagnostic tests for the detection of these EGFR mutations are now part of the routine management

70

of lung adenocarcinoma15. In spite of the invasiveness and morbidity associated with lung

71

biopsies16, the primary tumour is preferred for detection of mutations 17. Most often, an

72

amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS) is used for the detection of these mutations

73

from the biopsy. The utility of pleural effusion (PE) in the detection of EGFR mutations has been

74

well established over the years in the field of lung cancer diagnosis18, 19. In this study, we utilized

75

malignant pleural effusions in an attempt to detect EGFR mutations at our tertiary care centre.

84

Pleural fluid processing and DNA isolation

85

Pleural fluid was tapped from patients with malignant pleural effusions and centrifuged at 3500

86

rpm for 5 mins at 4°C to collect the cell pellet. The cell pellets were stored in -80°C until further

87

processing. The DNA was extracted from the samples using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen)

88

as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed for their quality using BioSpec Nano

89

UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp.) and electrophoresed on an agarose gel to ascertain

Optimization of a polymerase chain reaction protocol to amplify EGFR exon 18, 19, 20 and

113

114

Initially, we attempted a PCR amplification coupled with a direct sequencing approach to detect

115

EGFR mutations from malignant pleural effusions. Appropriate primers (sequences listed in table

116

1) were designed and optimized on sample S0. Successful amplification of exons 18-21 by PCR

117

on S0 are shown in figure 1. The primers for exon 18 and 21 had 55 °C as the annealing temperature

118

while exon 19 and 20 were best amplified at an annealing temperature of 57.8 °C.

Detection of a common exon 19 deletion detected from MPE by direct sequencing.

131

The amplicon sequences were compared with the reference EGFR sequence available on the

132

National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database and

133

exons 18, 20 and 21 were found to be identical. However, exon 19 was found to have an 18 bp

134

deletion (Fig. 3). On comparing with the wildtype EGFR cDNA sequence, this sequence was found

135

to have a deletion (c.2240_2258del18, p.L747_P753delinsS). Searches on cBioPortal and

136

COSMIC yielded multiple other studies that have reported the same mutation.

The analysis of the sequence using FinchTV has been shown in figure 4. We observed that this

143

patient’s sequences for exon 18, 20 and 21 were of good quality with no underlying peaks.

144

However, exon 19 sequence had variations in the sequence.

The PCR product for exon 19 was then diluted in DNA obtained from a control subject to evaluate

152

the efficiency of Direct sequencing. These varying dilutions (1 in 10, 1 in 25, 1 in 50 and 1 in 100)

153

were then subjected to PCR and subsequent Direct sequencing. We observed that though the

154

mutated sequence could be detected even at a 1 in 100 dilution (Fig 5) there were significant

155

limitations of this sequencing-based approach.

Figure 5: Sequencing of diluted S0 sample (1-part S0 DNA and 99 parts wildtype control DNA)

160

showed that while signatures of the deletion were still coming through, there was significant error

161

in base calls.

162
163

Malignant pleural effusions often contain wildtype stromal and hematopoietic cells along with the

164

metastatic lung cancer cells. In light of the above results, detection of single base part mutations

165

by direct sequencing of this heterogenous mix was obviously going to be a challenge. To overcome

166

this limitation of direct sequencing, we decided to use a mutant-specific PCR amplification assay

167

instead.

168
169

Mutant-specific quantitative PCR based detection of EGFR mutations from MPE suggests a

170

high frequency of S768I exon 20 mutation.

171

An established EGFR mutation real-time PCR kit was used to identify EGFR mutations in

172

malignant pleural effusions. The kit is optimized to detect mutations in a background of wild type

173

DNA with starting material as less as 3-5 ng of purified genomic DNA. The resultant qPCR was

175

samples thus passed were analyzed for mutation as described in the manual according to the

176

defined ΔCt parameters. Our results showed that 5/9 (55.55%) of pleural effusions probed had

177

EGFR mutations. Of these, 2/9 (22.22%) were the exon 19 deletion E746_S750del18 and 3/9

(33.33%) were the exon 20 S768I mutations. Table 2 describes these findings and Figure 6 presents

209
210

In our study we first used PCR coupled to direct sequencing to detect mutation in pleural effusion

211

derived malignant cells. We were able to detect a common mutation using this method. One of the

212

biggest drawbacks of Direct sequencing versus allele specific detection lies in its limit of detection.

213

Pleural fluid consists of a heterogeneous pool of stromal and inflammatory cells apart from the

214

metastatic cells. Since the non-tumor cells harbour wildtype genomic sequence, the signal to noise

215

ratio in electropherogram is lower for mutated sequence. The mutation sequence identification

216

may be compromised in the event of suboptimal malignant cells numbers. We showed that at

217

dilution of 1:100 of a mutated DNA with wildtype genomic DNA signatures of the mutation

218

continue but the wildtype sequence bases provide conflicting results in certain positions of the

219

gene. These inadequate results are more likely to be seen in single base pair mutations. We then

220

utilized an EGFR mutation detection kit. Commercially available diagnostic kits are designed for

221

testing EGFR mutation on FFPE sections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of

222

EGFR mutation testing by Taqman technology platform using pleural effusions in India. Jong Sik

223

Lee and colleagues have used PNA clamping technology to detect EGFR mutations in the

224

supernatant derived from the pleural effusion where in the objective was to detect mutations using

225

cell free DNA 25. Jie Lin et al have shown that EGFR mutations can be detected in the supernatant,

226

cell pellets of the pleural effusion using High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis and Sanger

227

sequencing 26.

228
229

When implemented on a small pilot scale study (n=9), we were successful in detecting EGFR

230

mutations in 5/9 (55%) subjects. The mutations that were detected in these samples were either

231

S768I or E746_S750del. Importantly, a study by Leventakos and group have shown that S7681

232

mutation in exon 20 of EGFR is rare and is usually found in combination with sensitizing mutations

233

and they have concluded that the predictive and prognostic role of this mutation is yet to be fully

234

explored 27. However, in another study it has been shown that S768I conferred reduced sensitivity

235

to gefitinib in vitro as compared to other mutations

236

of the samples exhibited this mutation in isolation with absence of any other mutation. Some of

237

the reasons for this large difference are discussed here. Most studies utilize the primary tissue and

238

may miss this mutation if it appears later in the pathogenesis of the disease. Another reason could

239

be that the mutation detection panels used in these studies did not include this mutation. One may

240

also simply come to the conclusion that our cohort has a larger number of patients with this

241

mutation, we think otherwise. We hypothesize that S768I is a secondary mutation that develops

242

later in the course of the disease and cells harbouring this mutation are able to migrate to, home in

243

or reside within the pleural cavity more easily that cells without this mutation. One could further

244

this speculation that cells having this mutation have a greater metastatic potential (figure 6).

245

Further studies will be needed to prove these hypotheses.
