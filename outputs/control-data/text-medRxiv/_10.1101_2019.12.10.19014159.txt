Abstract
Based on a few cases of childhood traumatic aphasia and hemispherectomy, Lenneberg
suggested a critical period for first language acquisition. Lenneberg’s ideas are still debated
today and have never been tested in a large group of children. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
provides such an opportunity as language acquisition is a common problem in ASD. Here, we
report data from a three-year-long observational trial of 8,766 children with ASD. We initiated
this trial in order to test two hypotheses: 1) voluntary imagination is central to complex language
and 2) there exists a strong critical period for voluntary imagination acquisition closing shortly
after the age of 5. Accordingly, we developed imagination exercises (verbal and nonverbal),

organized them into an application called Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) and
provided this MITA app gratis to children ages 2 to 12. MITA-experienced children (N=3,540)
were matched to the ‘treatment-as-usual’ participants (TaU, N=5,226). Both younger (2-5 years
of age) and older children (5-12 YOA) in MITA and TaU groups improved their language over
time, but on an annualized basis, younger MITA children improved their language 3-fold faster
than TaU group. There was no difference between MITA and TaU in the older children group.
These findings support Lenneberg’s critical period hypothesis and indicate that acquisition of
voluntary imagination is essential for the full language acquisition. Crucially, our results imply
that the underlying plasticity dramatically diminishes after the age of five and therefore even
greater therapeutic intervention should be targeting the very first years of a child’s life.

Introduction
Full command of complex language depends on an understanding of vocabulary as well as on
voluntary imagination 1 responsible for mental juxtaposition of objects into novel combinations
2

. Without voluntary imagination it is impossible to understand the difference between sentences

with identical words and grammar, such as “the cat on the mat” and “the mat on the cat.” Most
people anthropomorphically assume innate voluntary imagination abilities in all individuals.
Scientific evidence, however, points toward a more intricate story. While propensity toward
voluntary imagination is innate, acquisition of voluntary imagination seems to be a function of
using recursive language in early childhood 3–6. The maturation of frontoposterior fiber tracks
mediating voluntary imagination 7 depends on early childhood conversations 8,9. In the absence
of recursive conversations, children do not fine-tune these neurological connections and, as a
result, do not acquire voluntary imagination to the full extent 10. The autism community refers to

the phenomenon whereby individuals cannot combine disparate objects into a novel mental
image as stimulus overselectivity, or tunnel vision, or the lack of multi-cue responsivity 11–13.
Failure to juxtapose mental objects results in life-long inability to understand spatial
prepositions, recursion, and other complex sentences. These individuals, commonly referred to
as “low-functioning,” typically exhibit full-scale IQ below 70 14,15 and usually perform below the
score of 85 in non-verbal IQ tests 15. Among individuals diagnosed with ASD, the prevalence of
low-functioning ASD is 30 to 40% 16.
We hypothesized that 1) imagination exercises can improve language ability and 2) there exists a
strong critical period for voluntary imagination acquisition, which ends shortly after the age of 5
17–21

. Accordingly, we designed various developmental activities, all of which follow a

systematic approach to train voluntary imagination verbally as well as outside of the verbal
domain 22–25. To make these activities dynamic and attractive to children, we organized them into
an application called Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA). MITA verbal activities start
with simple vocabulary-building exercises and progress towards exercises aimed at higher forms
of language, such as noun-adjective combinations, spatial prepositions, recursion, and syntax 23.
E. g., a child can be instructed to select the {small/large} {red/ blue/green/orange} ball or to put
the cup {on/under/behind/in front of} the table. All exercises are deliberately limited to as few
nouns as possible since the aim is not to expand a child’s one-word vocabulary, but rather to
teach him/her to integrate mental objects in novel ways by utilizing voluntary imagination 23.
MITA activities outside of the verbal domain aim to provide the same voluntary imagination
training visually through implicit instructions as has been described in Ref.24. E.g., a child can be
presented with two separate images of a train and a window pattern, and a choice of complete

trains. The task is to find the correct complete train and place it into the empty square. This
exercise requires not only attending to a variety of different features in both the train and its
windows, but also combining two separate pieces into a single image (in other words, mentally
integrating separate train parts into a single unified gestalt). As levels progress, the exercises
increase in difficulty, requiring attention to more and more features and details. Upon attaining
the most difficult levels, the child must attend to as many as eight features simultaneously.
Previous results from our studies have demonstrated that children who cannot follow the explicit
verbal instruction can often follow an equivalent command implicit in the visual set-up of the
puzzle 23.
Voluntary imagination is an internal, subjective function that does not always manifest itself to
an outside observer 2. Unlike expanding vocabulary that can be surveyed quickly, it may take
several years before an initially minimally verbal person expresses his/her voluntary imagination
skills through language. As a result, studying voluntary imagination acquisition is an arduous
process in which the result may not be known for several years.
We have previously described a framework for investigating targeted interventions for ASD
children epidemiologically, whereby caregivers submit multiple assessments longitudinally 26.
When a single parent completes the same evaluation over multiple years, changes in the score
become meaningful. Using the comprehensive 77-question Autism Treatment Evaluation
Checklist (ATEC) 27 over the period of several years we have previously demonstrated
significant differences between the groups of children 26. Younger children improved more than
the older children in all four ATEC subscales – Language, Sociability, Cognitive awareness, and
Health. Children with milder ASD demonstrated higher improvement in the Language subscale

than children with more severe ASD. There was no difference in improvement between females
vs. males in any subscale. Children from non-English-speaking countries (primarily Romancespeaking countries) improved more than children from English-speaking countries in all four
subscales.
In this report we apply the same framework to study the MITA voluntary imagination
intervention in children ages 2 to 12 years. The data collected over three and a half years show
greater language improvement in MITA-experienced children compared to matched ‘treatment
as usual’ controls. Crucially, this difference is observed only in children of 2 to 5 years of age
implying that the underlying plasticity dramatically diminishes after the age of five and
suggesting a strong critical period for voluntary imagination acquisition.

Results
We first sought to replicate our previous results 26 using the new and significantly larger
databases. The analysis of groups within the TaU database confirmed the results reported in
2018. There was no difference between females vs. males in any subscale. Younger children
improved more than the older children in the Language, Sociability, and Cognitive awareness
subscales (Tables S1, S2). Children with milder ASD improved more than children with more
severe ASD in the Language subscale (Tables S5, S6). Children from non-English-speaking
countries (primarily Romance-speaking countries) improved more than children from Englishspeaking countries in all four subscales (Tables S9, S10). The analysis of groups within the
MITA database was consistent with analysis of groups within the TaU database. There was no
difference between females vs. males in any subscale. Younger children improved more than the

older children in the Language subscale (Tables S3, S4). Children with milder ASD improved
more than children with more severe ASD in the Language subscale (Tables S7, S8). We did not
have enough participants from non-English-speaking countries in the MITA database for
statistical analysis.
Having demonstrated continuity with respect to group differences within each database, we have
applied the same statistical framework to study the difference between the MITA group and the
TaU group. Both younger (2-5 YOA) and older (5-12 YOA) children in the MITA and TaU
groups improved their symptoms over time in all subscales. The greatest interest was the
Language subscale targeted by the intervention. The average improvement in younger MITA
children over three years was 8.64 points (SE=0.47, p<0.0001) compared to 2.88 points
(SE=0.54, p<0.0001) in the TaU group, Figure 1, Table 1. The difference in the Language
subscale in the MITA group relative to the TaU group at Visit 12 was -4.68 points (SE=0.72,
p<0.0001); a lower score indicates greater improvement in the MITA group.
The average improvement in older MITA children over the three-year period was 3.27 points
(SE=0.86, p=0.0002) compared to 2.41 points improvement (SE=0.28, p<0.0001) in the TaU
group, Table 2. The difference in the MITA group relative to the TaU group at Visit 12 was not
statistically significant. Thus, younger MITA children, but not older MITA children showed
significantly greater improvement than the TaU group. On the annualized basis, younger MITA
children improved their language three times faster than TaU children (MITA=2.88 points/year;
TaU=0.96 points/year).

Discussion
In this report, we described data from an observational trial of tablet-based imagination exercises
– Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism or MITA 22 – that included 3,540 children with ASD who
worked with MITA a median duration of 520 (IQR: 384-706) days and 5,226 treatment-as-usual
(TaU) children. This is the longest-running and the largest study of a caregiver-administered
early intervention tool for young children with ASD. Both younger (2-5 years of age) and older
children (5-12 YOA) in MITA and TaU groups improved their language over time, but on an
annualized basis, younger MITA children improved their language 3-fold faster than the TaU
group, Figure 1A. There was no difference between MITA and TaU in the older children group,
Figure 1B.
Greater language improvement in the younger but not older MITA children compared to TaU,
supports Lenneberg’s critical period hypothesis 28 independent of the exercises’ exact mode of
action. It is possible that imagination exercises directly trained neural networks essential for
language 8. It is also possible that MITA group caregivers were simply more motivated in
administering language therapy in general. Additionally, MITA caregivers could learn language
therapy techniques, such as “put the cup {on/under/behind} the table,” from MITA and then
extend those techniques to everyday activities multiplying the effect of exercises many-fold. The
exact mechanism of MITA action cannot be identified in an observational trial. Whatever the
mechanism, it worked only up to the age of five consistent with the strong critical period.
Arguably, this is the most important conclusion of this study.
One of the reasons for the high number of low-functioning ASD individuals is deep
misunderstanding of the critical period. It is not uncommon for parents to brush off their child’s

language delay until elementary school, at which time, according to the data presented in this
manuscript, it may be too late. While clinicians are usually aware of the critical period and
normally recommend early intervention at the time of diagnosis, they are often reluctant to
emphasize the urgent nature of the problem to the parents due to a complete lack of longitudinal
studies comparing a language intervention targeting vulnerable children of various ages 29. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study administering the same language intervention to
a large group of ASD children over three years. A better understanding of the strong critical
period will result in greater effort toward language therapy in very young children and eventually
in many more high-functioning productive lives.
Our second hypothesis was that voluntary imagination exercises can improve language ability. In
fact, many techniques used by speech language pathologists (SLP) and Applied Behavioral
Analysis (ABA) therapists happen to aim at improving voluntary imagination. SLPs commonly
refer to these techniques as “combining adjectives, location/orientation, color, and size with
nouns,” “following directions with increasing complexity,” and “building the multiple
features/clauses in the sentence” 30. In ABA jargon, these techniques are known as “visual-visual
and auditory-visual conditional discrimination” 31–34, “development of multi-cue responsivity” 12,
and “reduction of stimulus overselectivity” 13. However, voluntary imagination exercises are just
a small part of language therapy that primarily focuses on building up the child’s vocabulary.
Moreover, voluntary imagination exercises administered by therapists are mostly verbal in their
nature, which can be abstruse for nonverbal and minimally-verbal children with ASD 23. While
visual reinforcers, such as 3D models and pictures, are utilized in therapy, tangible objects are
always limited in their range and adaptability. Conversely, MITA exercises are disguised as

engaging games, limitless in variations, and exclusively focused on training voluntary
imagination.
The hypothesis that voluntary imagination exercises can improve language ability would have
been rejected if data presented herein had shown no difference between MITA and TaU groups.
This has not been the case since our data showed significantly greater improvement in language
in younger children which have used MITA. This observation can be explained by the direct or
indirect effect of exercises or by selection-bias of MITA caregivers, who could simply be more
motivated in their approach to therapy. In fact, MITA caregivers had to actively search for
autism apps, download the app and then administer the therapy over six months or longer.
However, TaU caregivers have also had to demonstrate similar motivation by actively searching
for online ATEC evaluation and voluntarily completing at least three evaluations over 12 months
or longer. Furthermore, if greater caregiver motivation is the explanation for better MITA
outcome, one would expect to see an improved outcome in all areas of child development.
However, MITA group showed better outcome only in the Language subscale, but not in the
Sociability, Cognitive awareness, or Health subscales. Moreover, the greatest difference in
language is only expressed two years after beginning of MITA exercises, see Figure 1A.
Improvements in vocabulary can usually be detected much faster. The reported long delay is
consistent with the initial improvement of an internal component, such as the subjective function
of voluntary imagination, that does not readily manifest itself to an outside observer 2. The
Language subscale of ATEC primarily assesses expressive language that depends on voluntary
imagination, but can be influenced by many other factors as well. It may take several years
before an initially nonverbal or minimally verbal child expresses his/her voluntary imagination

skills through language. We conclude that the direct or indirect effect of imagination exercises
on language cannot be excluded and in fact could be the most parsimonious explanation for the
observed results.

Limitations
The observational design of this study cannot definitively prove causality since unknown
confounders may influence the study results. The golden standard of testing a novel clinical
intervention is randomized controlled trial (RCT). Prior to conducting the MITA study, we have
run the proposal for a therapist-administered RCT of voluntary imagination intervention through
many potential funders and collaborators. The proposal has failed to find any traction. We have
also considered a caregiver-administered RCT, but decided against it due to high attrition rate.
The only published RCT of caregiver-administered tablet-based therapy for young children with
ASD reported an overwhelming drop just after 3 months despite every biweekly telephone calls
to encourage app use 35: during the first 3-month period, participants exercised for a total median
time of 1,593 minutes (just under the recommended target of 20 min/day or 1,800 min/3-month
period); during the second 3-month period, participants exercised for a total median time of 23
minutes (98.6% drop in app use). In effect, most participants did not receive any intervention
after the first 3-month period and therefore were lost for the RCT 35. As the minimal length of an
voluntary imagination intervention RCT is likely to exceed two years 36,37, participant dropout
becomes the major issue. This high attrition rate introduces multiple selection biases that degrade
RCT ability to demonstrate causality and essentially makes it no better than an observational
trial. In this study, we used propensity score analysis 38 to identify comparable individuals based
on age and all four evaluation subscales. For each participant in the MITA group, a match was

found by choosing the control observation with the closest propensity score. Propensity score
matching does not completely address selection bias, but it significantly improves group
similarity.
Another disadvantage of low-cost geographically diverse observational trials is their reliance on
parent-reported outcome measures. There is an understanding in the psychological community
that parents cannot be trusted with an evaluation of their own children. In fact, parents often
yield to wishful thinking and overestimate their children's abilities on a single assessment 39.
However, the pattern of changes can be generated by measuring the score dynamics over
multiple assessments. When a single parent completes the same evaluation every three
months over multiple years, changes in the score become meaningful. In this trial we used a
comprehensive 77-question ATEC evaluation validated in multiple clinical trials 26,35,40–45,
assessing participants on four diverse scales of development (Language, Sociability, Cognitive
awareness, and Health) and administered at regular 3-month intervals. If there was a selection
bias in parents’ responses in this trial, it would be expected to artificially inflate improvement in
the TaU group. Unlike MITA parents, evaluation reminders were not sent to TaU parents. All
TaU evaluations have been completed spontaneously and therefore may have experienced a
selection bias among parents for whom the evaluations reported greater improvement. This
selection bias would not be expected in the MITA group, as all evaluations were scheduled and
mandatory.

Conclusions
Five major conclusions follow up from this study. First, the plasticity essential for acquisition of

first language may reduce significantly after the age of five years consistent with Lenneberg’s
critical period hypothesis 28. Second, voluntary imagination is an essential component of full
language and imagination exercises may be an indispensable component of language therapy.
Third, the minimal necessary duration of a clinical trial investigating the effect of imagination
exercises could exceed two years. Fourth, some caregivers are capable of administering tabletbased exercises to their children consistently over many years. Fifth, parent-administered parentreported multiyear observational trials can be an attractive low-cost model for studying novel
language, behavioral, and dietary interventions. The significant improvement of language
observed in the current trial brings hope to many families and inspires us to continue developing
imagination exercises and translate MITA to multiple language. The major strength of this study
is the large number of long-term participants. The most obvious limitation of the study is that
this study observational design cannot definitively prove causality since not all confounders can
be adjusted appropriately.

Methods
MITA exercises
MITA includes both verbal and nonverbal exercises aiming to develop voluntary imagination
ability 3. MITA verbal activities use higher forms of language, such as noun-adjective
combinations, spatial prepositions, recursion, and syntax 4 to train voluntary imagination: e. g., a
child can be instructed to put the large red dog behind the orange chair, Figure 2A; or identify
the wet animal after the lion was showered by the monkey; or take animals home following an
explanation that the lion lives above the monkey and under the cow, Figure 2B. In every activity

a child listens to a short story, then works within an immersive interface to generate an answer;
correct answers are rewarded. To avoid routinization, all instructions are generated dynamically
from individual words. Collectively, verbal activities have over 10 million different instructions,
so most instructions will never be heard twice by a child.

dog behind the orange chair. (B) A child is instructed: Imagine. The lion lives above the
monkey and under the cow. Take animals home. Note that animals cannot be dragged to
their apartments during instructions, encouraging a child to imagine animals’ correct
positions in the mind.

MITA nonverbal activities aim to provide the same voluntary imagination training visually
through implicit instructions 5. E.g., a child can be presented with two separate images of a train
and a window pattern, and a choice of complete trains. The task is to find the correct complete
train. The child is encouraged to avoid trial-and-error and integrate separate train parts mentally,

thus training voluntary imagination, Figure 3A. Different games use various tasks and visual
patterns to keep a child engaged, Figure 3B. Most puzzles are assembled dynamically from
multiple pieces so that they never repeat themselves. Collectively, MITA activities are designed
to last for approximately 10 years.

MITA group
The MITA app was made available gratis at all major app stores in February 2016. Once the app
was downloaded, the caregiver was asked to register and to provide demographic details,
including the child’s diagnosis and age. Caregivers consented to anonymized data analysis and
completed Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) 27. The first evaluation was
administered approximately one month after the first use of MITA and once 100 puzzles had
been completed. The subsequent evaluations were administered at three-month intervals. Parents

were asked to complete evaluations independently of a child’s actual use of MITA.
From this pool of potential study participants, we selected participants based on the following
criteria:
1) Consistency: Participants must have filled out at least three ATEC evaluations and the
interval between the first and the last evaluation was six months or longer.
2) Diagnosis: The subject must have self-reported their diagnosis as ASD.
3) Maximum age: Participants older than twelve years of age were excluded from this study.
4) Minimum age: Participants who completed their first evaluation before the age of two years
were excluded from this study.
5) Minimal ATEC severity: Participants with initial ATEC scores of less than 20 were
excluded.
6) Language: Participants who indicated their primary language was not English were excluded
from the study.
After excluding participants that did not meet these criteria, there were 3,540 total participants,
Table 3.

Control group
Independently from MITA, ATEC responses were collected by the Autism Institute from
participants voluntarily completing online ATEC evaluations from 2013 to 2019. Little is known
about their treatment, but it is unlikely that many of them used MITA. Accordingly, these
participants served as a ‘treatment as usual’ control. Participant selection was described in detail

in Ref. 26. In short, participants were selected based on the following criteria:
1) Completeness: Participants who did not provide a date of birth (DOB) were excluded. As
participants’ DOB were utilized to determine age, the availability of DOB was necessary.
2) Consistency: Participants had to have completed at least three questionnaires and the interval
between the first and the last evaluation was one year or longer.
3) Maximum age: Participants older than twelve years of age were excluded from this study.
As diagnosis was not part of the ATEC questionnaire, some neurotypical participants could be
present in the database. To limit the contribution from neurotypical children, we excluded
participants that may have represented the neurotypical population by using the Minimum age
and the Minimal ATEC severity criteria.
4) Minimum age: Participants who completed their first evaluation before the age of 2 were
excluded from this study, as the diagnosing of ASD in this age group is uncertain and the parents
of some of these young cases may have completed the ATEC because they wanted to check
whether their normal child had signs of autism.
5) Minimal ATEC severity: Participants with initial ATEC scores of less than 20 were
excluded.
6) Language: Participants who indicated their primary language was not English were excluded
from the study.
After excluding participants that did not meet these criteria, there were 5,226 total participants.

Table 3. Characteristics and baseline measures for all age groups. A lower ATEC score
indicates a lower severity of ASD symptoms.

Outcome measures
A caregiver-completed Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) 27 was used to track the
efficacy of a treatment. ATEC is comprised of four subscales: 1)
Speech/Language/Communication, 2) Sociability, 3) Sensory/Cognitive Awareness, and 4)
Physical/Health/Behavior. The first subscale, Speech/Language/Communication, contains 14
items and its score ranges from 0 to 28 points. The Sociability subscale contains 20 items within
a score range from 0 to 40 points. The third subscale, Sensory/Cognitive awareness, has 18 items
and scores range from 0 to 36 points. Finally, the Health/Physical/Behavior subscale contains 25
items and scores range from 0 to 75 points. The scores from each subscale are combined in order
to calculate a Total Score, which ranges from 0 to 179 points. A lower score indicates lower
severity of ASD symptoms and a higher score correlates with more severe symptoms of ASD.

Statistical analysis
The framework for evaluation of ATEC score changes over time was explained in detail in Ref.

. In short, the concept of a “Visit” was developed by dividing the three-year-long observation

interval into 3-month periods. All evaluations were mapped into 3-month-long bins with the first
evaluation placed in the first bin. When more than one evaluation was completed within a bin,
their results were averaged to calculate a single number representing this 3-month interval. It was
then hypothesized that there was a three-way interaction between an age group, Visit, and
treatment. Statistically, this hypothesis was modeled by applying the Linear Model with repeated
measures, where a three-way interaction term was introduced to test the hypothesis. Least
squares means (LS Means) and LS Means differences were calculated for all ATEC subscales
(Language, Sociability, Cognitive awareness, and Health) at all visits. Participants in the MITA
group were matched to those in TaU group using propensity score analysis 38 based on age and
all four ATEC subscales at baseline.
