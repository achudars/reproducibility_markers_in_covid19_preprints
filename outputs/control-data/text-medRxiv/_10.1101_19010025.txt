Abstract
Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing
interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. The incidence of IPF is
increasing year by year, as well as the mortality rates, which is really a
burden both for the family and the society. However few data concerning
the economic burden of the patients with IPF is available , especially in
China.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the direct medical costs of hospitalized
patients with IPF and to determine the contributing factors.
Methods
This retrospective analysis used the cost-of-illness framework in order to
analyze the direct medical costs of patients with IPF. The study used data
from the pneumology department of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital
affiliated to Capital Medical University from year 2012 to 2015. The
direct medical costs included drug fee, auxiliary examination fee,
treatment fee and other fee. Patients’ characteristics, medical treatment,
and the direct medical costs were analyzed by descriptive statistics and
multivariable regression.

Results
There were 219 hospitalized patients meeting the diagnosis of IPF, 91%
male. The mean age was 65 years old. For the direct medical costs of
hospitalized patients with IPF, the mean(SD) of the total costs per IPF
patient per admission was 14882.3 (30975.8)CNY. The largest parts were
the examination fee of 6034.5 (15651.2)CNY and the drug fee of 5048.9
(3855.1)CNY. By regression analysis we found that length of stay ,
emergency treatment, ventilator use and being a Beijing native were
significantly (P<0.05) associated with total hospitalization costs, and the
length of stay had the biggest impact. Complications or comorbidities
contributated to the direct medical costs as follows: respiratory failure
with 30898.3CNY (P=0.004), pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) with
26898.2CNY (P=0.098), emphysema with 25368.3CNY (P=0.033), and
high blood pressure with 24659.4CNY (P=0.026). Using DLCO or
DLCO% pred to reflect the severity of IPF, there was no significant
correlation between DLCO or DLCO% pred and patients' direct medical
costs. While, the worse the diffusion function, the higher the drug fee.
Conclusion
This study showed that IPF has a major impact on the direct medical
costs. Thus, appropriate long-term interventions are recommended to
lower the economic burden of IPF.

Strengths and limitations of this study
It was the first time in China to discuss the economic burden of diseases
and its influencing factors in patients with IPF.
The results of this study might be of reference for the establishment of IPF
disease-related medical policies in future.
The retrospective cross-sectional design does not allow for establishing
any causal relationships.
It was a a single-center study, resulting a slightly smaller sample size.A
large sample of multicenter studies is needed to confirm this.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a specific form of
chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia limited to the lung, which is
characterized by the pathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia
(UIP) and affects usually the elderly. Its etiology is unclear, but genetic
factors, smoking and occupational environment exposure may be risk

factors.[1-3]
The estimates of the incidence of IPF show a wide variation in different
countries, ranging from 3 to 9 per 100000 per year in North America and
Europe, while in South America and Asia the incidence was reported to
be lower, ranging from 1.2 to 4.16 per 100000 per year.[4] A recent study
confirmed that the higher the age of the patient the higher the incidence
of IPF.[5] The studies also showed that the mortality was increasing,
ranging from 4.68 to 13.36 per 100000. In England and Wales, the deaths
from IPF have tripled in the past 20 years .[4]
In China, there are no national population-based data on incidence,
prevalence and mortality of IPF. However, data from a large ILD center
showed that IPF is the most common subtype of ILD, with increasing
numbers of hospitalized patients. With more patients living with IPF, it is
important to understand the economic burden associated with this
disease.[6]

Methods
Design and date sources
This research was designed as a retrospective cross-sectional analysis.
Claims data were obtained from the IPF cohort and the database of
discharged

patients of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital from the years 2012

to 2015 (219 cases). Data were retrieved from the hospital case statistics

management system, including patient characteristics, co-morbid
conditions, health-care use and cost.IPF was diagnosed according to the
ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT

Statement.[3]Co-morbid

conditions

included

complications and comorbidities,which were defined as any listing of the
specific co-morbid diagnosis code until and during the hospitalization.
These included respiratory infections, respiratory failure, pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH), lung cancer, high blood pressure (HBP),
coronary heart disease, emphysema, diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD), heart failure, asthma, bronchiectasis. In our study, since
all patients lacked right heart catheter monitoring, pulmonary
hypertension was defined as an estimated sPAP ≥37 mmHg by Doppler
echocardiography based on the 2009 European Society of Cardiology
(ESC)/ERS PH Guideline and was divided into three grades:[7] (1) PH
unlikely: TRV ≤2.8 m/s, sPAP ≤36 mmHg. (2) PH possible: TRV 2.9–
3.4 m/s, sPAP 37–50 mmHg. (3) PH likely: TRV >3.4 m/s, sPAP >50
mmHg.
The study was reviewed and approved by the Human Ethics Review
Committee of the Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital. Written informed consent
was obtained from all the patients.
This study used the direct medical costs of hospitalized patient with IPF,
which reflect the direct medical economic burden of these patients,

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess HRU (Health Care
Resource Utilization) of patients with IPF. Means and standard deviations
(SD) were reported for continuous variables, and proportions were
reported for categorical variables. The rank-sum test was used to detect
the differences for continuous variables. A multiple linear regression
(MLR) was utilized to estimate the impact on costs, with the use of step
wise regression. Nine independent variables were entered into the
regression model, including gender, age, native place reimbursement,
length of stay, hospital outcome,ventilator use , and emergency treatment

（as shown in Table 2）. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to
evaluate which co-morbid conditions drive total costs after accounting for
patient characteristics in the total population. P-value ＜ 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

have a variety of co-morbid conditions. The prevalence of selected
co-morbid conditions of IPF patients was showed in table 4.
Health Care Resource Utilization
The mean（SD） length of hospital stay was 10.1（8） days. Procedures
such as chest X-ray (16%), computed tomography (CT) scan (60%),
pulmonary function tests (60%), bronchoscopy (43%) and oxygen
therapy (84%) were frequently applied. Moreover, 5.9% of cases were
treated with invasive or noninvasive ventilation , and 1.4% in the ICU.

Costs
For hospitalized patients with IPF, the mean (SD) direct medical costs
was 14882.3 (30975.8) CNY per capita per admission. The results of
costs of medical services for IPF are summarized in Table 5. This table
shows that the examination fee, with spending of 6034.5 (15651.2) CNY
in total, was the largest proportion (41%) of the direct medical costs.
Table 5 also shows that the cost of antibiotics was as much as of
non-antibiotics. More details are summarized in Table 5.

The direct medical costs of IPF decreased during the 4 years of this study,
from 16219.2CNY in 2012 to 13513.8CNY in 2015 (Fig.1 ). This was
mainly due to a decrease in the drug fee from 5908.0CNY to 3476.6CNY
due to the policy of medicine fee decreasing.

Regression analysis for the direct medical costs
Univariate regression analysis showed that length of hospital stay,
emergency treatment, ventilator use and being a Beijing native were
significantly (P<0.05) associated with direct medical costs (Table 6).
Multivariate regression analysis showed that the length of hospital stay
had the biggest impact. The direct medical costs were not significantly
associated with gender or age.

Co-morbid conditions with a significant impact on the direct medical
costs included respiratory failure (P=0.004), emphysema (P=0.033), HBP
(P=0.026). For the patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the cost
increased significantly, with P value less than 0.1.The impact on direct
medical costs was greatest for respiratory failure (30898.3 CNY), being
3-fold higher than in patients without respiratory failure, followed by the
direct medical costs for those with pulmonary arterial hypertension
(almost 3-fold increased). (Table 8, Fig 2).

Relationship between lung function and costs
131 cases completed lung function tests while in hospital. Analysis of
FVC, FVC% pred, DLCO, and DLCO% pred showed that FVC and FVC%
pred were negatively correlated with their direct medical costs (P

＜ 0.05). Moreover, the total drug costs increased significantly with
increasing severity of diffusion impairment (Table 9 ).

medical costs of patients with IPF, from a single center database
representing medical claims and health-care costs. We found that there
were 219 patients diagnosed with IPF from 2012 to 2015.
The age span of IPF patients was 41-88 years old, with an average age of
65 years old and a male predominance, as previously reported.[8-10]Most
importantly, we found that the direct medical economic burden of the IPF
inpatients was 14882.3 CNY per patient per admission, of which the costs
of examination accounted for 41% of the total, as the largest part,which
was similar to a recent study in china.[11]The serious lung function
decrease, having comorbities such as respiratory failure, emphysema and
high blood pressure, accompanied by length of hospital stay, emergency
treatment, ventigator use were the main factors related to increased costs.
COPD is a disease with a huge economic burden. In China, mean annual
direct medical costs have been estimated at around 24,372 CNY for a
patient with COPD.[12]A Danish study showed that the annual net costs
were €8572 for a patients with COPD, which was only one third of that of
patients with IPF.[13] In the US, total direct medical costs (including
inpatient services, outpatient services and medication claims) and
inpatient costs for patients with IPF were found to be $26,378 and $9,100
per person-year, respectively, approximately 2-times higher than
controls.[14]In Spain, the estimated annual costs per IPF patient with

stable disease, slow and rapid disease progression was €11,484, €20,978
and €57,759, respectively. This corresponded to a weighted average
annual cost of €26,435.[15]The costs of our study was calculated from
only a single hospitalization of patients with IPF during 2012 to 2015,
which was more than half of the annual costs for a Chinese patient with
COPD. When the medical costs of whole year including the outpatient
services would be calculated together, the total costs for IPF would be
much higher. In 2015, the average per capita adjusted net national income
in the USA was $ 48,967, while it was only $ 6,352 in China.[16] All
these suggested that IPF was also disease condition resulting in large
economical burden in China.
Most of patients were first diagnosed as IPF following the approach of
ILD during their hospitalization, so the examination fees ranked first,
followed by the drug fees, accounting for one third. The Spanish study
also found that a significant increase in the annual cost per patient was
due to the treatment of acute exacerbation.[15]Nowadays, the treatment
options of IPF are limited to the internationally recommended antifibrotic
drugs pirfenidone and nintedanib.[17-19]However the costs for these
drugs were not relevant to this study, because pirfenidone has not been
supplied by the hospital pharmacy at the time of this study, and
nintedanib was not available in China until 2018. The estimated total cost
had approxiamately 5 times increase to around €80,000 after use of

pirfenidone and nintedanib in France.[20]So the economical burden
would be increased with the use of antifibrotic drugs.
Regarding the impact of factors related to the direct medical costs, the
regression analysis found that length of stay, emergency treatment,
ventilator use and Beijing residency were significantly associated with
total hospitalization costs. Among these factors, the length of hospital
stay had the biggest impact. We know that a variety of factors affect the
duration of hospitalization, including disease severity. Thus, the rational
use of the allocation of medical resources can significantly reduce the
direct medical economic burden on patients. In this study, 5% and 1.4%
patients had ventilator use and emergency treatment during the
hospitalization, which would consume more health care resources and
need more complex medical therapies, inducing more costs.
The patients with IPF often have complications and other comorbidities
which include pulmonary arterial hypertension, emphysema, diabetes,
lung cancer, GERD, and cardiovascular disease [3,21] and require
substantial health care resources, leading to increased overall burden of
illness.[22]Ning Wu found that patients with IPF have a high burden of
co-morbid conditions and HRU compared to non-IPF patients.[23]Collard
et al found that pulmonary infection, coronary artery disease, diabetes and
heart failure were the most prevalent comorbidity and all were

significantly more common in IPF than in controls.[14]In this study,
which was a cross-sectional review,there were only 4 patients with lung
cancer in IPF and only 19 patients completed the 24-hour ambulatory
esophageal pH and pressure recording.As a result,the GERD and lung
cancer prevalence was lower than the previews study and the group was
too small to be statistically significant.[24,25]As our study showed,
pulmonary infection, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease,
respiratory failure, diabetes, emphysema and pulmonary arterial
hypertension were the most prevalent comorbidity codes in the
IPF.Another study in china had showed that the prevalence of IPF
patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and emphsema was 29%
and 42% respectively.[26]The costs of IPF patients with respiratory
failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension were found to be higher than
for other patients. This results are similar to a previous study.[27]Most
series have shown a higher mortality when pulmonary arterial
hypertension is present in IPF patients.[28-29]Thus, an IPF patient with
pulmonary arterial hypertension will raise the economic burden.
There are several limitation. firstly, this is a retrospective research from a
single center. Secondly, only the costs for hospitalization and not annual
costs were analyzed. Thirdly, the costs of antifibrotic drugs were not
included due to lack of available drugs during the study time.

Conclusion
As the prevalence of IPF appears to be rising along with an increasing
burden on our healthcare system, a substantial increase in public
awareness and research funding will be necessary to address the unmet
needs and reduce the clinical and economic burden of this still incurable
illness.
