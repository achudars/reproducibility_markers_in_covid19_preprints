Abstract

18

Background: Using a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

19

within an intensive care unit (ICU), we explore how differing hospital population

20

structures impact these infection dynamics.

21

Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model of an 18-bed ICU, we compared the

22

rates of MRSA acquisition across three potential population structures: a Single Staff

23

Type (SST) model with nurses and physicians as a single staff type, a model with

24

separate staff types for nurses and physicians (Nurse-MD model), and a

25

Metapopulation model where each nurse was assigned a group of patients. By varying

26

the proportion of time spent with the assigned patient group (g) within the

27

Metapopulation model, we explored whether simpler models may be acceptable

28

approximations to more realistic patient-healthcare staff contact patterns.

29

Results: The SST, Nurse-MD, and Metapopulation models had a mean annual number

30

of cumulative MRSA acquisitions of 40.6, 32.2 and 19.6 respectively. All models were

31

sensitive to the same parameters in the same direction, although the Metapopulation

32

model was less sensitive. The number of acquisitions varied non-linearly by values of g,

33

with values below 0.40 resembling the Nurse-MD model, while values above that

34

converged toward the metapopulation structure.

35

Discussion: The population structure of a modeled hospital has considerable impact on

36

model results, with the SST model having more than double the acquisition rate of the

37

more structured Metapopulation model. While the direction of parameter sensitivity

38

remained the same, the magnitude of these differences varied, producing different

39

infection rates across relatively similar populations. The non-linearity of the model’s

40

response to differing values of g suggests only a narrow space of relatively dispersed

41

nursing assignments where simple model approximations are appropriate.

42

Conclusion: Simplifying assumptions around how a hospital population is modeled,

43

especially assuming random mixing, may overestimate infection rates and the impact of

44

interventions.

Introduction
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers methicillin-

48

resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to be a serious threat to patient safety, and

49

recent trends show that the incidence of infection is no longer declining as aggressively

50

as it has for much of the last decade [1]. The evidence base for interventions to

51

successfully address MRSA is mixed. For example, it has been difficult to quantify the

52

effectiveness of MRSA screening and contact precautions, which has led to

53

disagreement over their benefit [2]–[5]. Other efforts, such as improved hand hygiene

54

are often successful [6], [7], but reducing MRSA acquisitions by means of improved

55

transmission prevention continues to be a focus for hospital infection control efforts.

56

Preventing the spread of MRSA within intensive care units (ICUs) is especially

57

critical, due to the vulnerable nature of the patients and the difficulty in treating severe

58

infections. Patients admitted to the ICU have been found to have persistent colonization

59

with MRSA 12-14 days after discharge from the hospital [8]. There is strong evidence

60

that frequency and patterns of interaction between staff and patients play a critical role

61

in transmission [9]. The ratio of nurses to patients has been found to contribute to the

62

overall level of colonization and transmission within healthcare settings and ICUs.

63

Lower nurse-to-patient ratios have a positive correlation with increased transmission

64

and poor health outcomes [10]. Beyond this, clinical practices such as the use of

65

consistent care teams, grouping particular types of patients together, or even the

66

hospital’s built environment may create distinctive sub-populations even within a single

67

unit. These sub-populations then form a larger, interconnected “metapopulation”, the

68

infection dynamics of which, in a hospital setting, remain largely unexplored. In other

69

areas of infectious disease epidemiology, metapopulations and other complex

70

population structures have been shown to be important [11], [12].

71

Studying the transmission of MRSA within an ICU is often a difficult task due to

72

the highly constrained environment. The patient population within any given ICU is

73

small, with patients sharing care team, being impacted by the same policies, and

74

sharing the same environment, which violates the independence assumptions

75

underlying many statistical techniques. There are limited or no control groups due to co-

76

occurring interventions and the clinical care mission, and many potential interventions,

77

such as policy changes, are difficult if not impossible to effectively blind as part of a

78

clinical trial.

79

Using mathematical models can help alleviate many of these issues. Widely used

80

models generally which assume random mixing between healthcare workers and

81

patients, where all patients are cared for by all healthcare workers, but clinical practices

82

such as the use of consistent care teams, grouping particular types of patients together,

83

etc. naturally creates a metapopulation like structure within hospital units. Patient

84

isolation and limited interaction with other patients creates sub-populations within the

85

larger patient population forming a weakly connected metapopulation.

86

Evidence suggests that modeling disease transmission dynamics within

87

metapopulations has an important role in understanding the underlying patterns that

88

govern disease spread. One previous study [13] suggested that nurses caring for

89

specific patients can reduce the basic reproductive number (R0) of a healthcare-

90

associated pathogen below 1.0, though this model examined a particularly strict form of

91

non-random mixing, examining the circumstance of a nurse visiting the same patient as

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002402; this version posted August 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

92

they previously cared for rather than visiting another patient. More specifically, the

93

spatial patterns and aggregation of host populations are important in identifying how a

94

pathogen is introduced and dispersed within a population [14]. Rarely, however, are

95

healthcare settings modeled as metapopulations.

96

Using a stochastic compartmental model of an 18-bed ICU, we compared three

97

potential population structures: a single staff type model with nurses and physicians as

98

the same type of healthcare worker, a model with separate staff types for nurses and

99

physicians where they are different types of healthcare workers, and a highly structured

100

model where each nurse is assigned a specific group of patients, in order to examine

101

the impact of treating an ICU with a metapopulation type structure. These models are

102

hereafter referred to as “SST”, “Nurse-MD” and “Metapopulation” respectively. We

103

explored the impact on the estimated number of MRSA acquisitions and the sensitivity

104

of the different models to changes in their underlying parameters.

105

We then developed a hybrid model that allows a nurse to randomly interact with

106

patients not originally under their direct care over some proportion of their workday. This

107

hybrid model allows for a population that is primarily, but not exclusively, organized into

108

distinct sub-populations, but still allows for some interaction between nurses and all

109

patients. The limited random interaction represents variance from patient assignments

110

often seen in the ICU environment, such as cross-coverage during breaks or complex

111

procedures that require higher numbers of healthcare workers.

Model Structure

115

MRSA transmission was simulated in an 18-bed ICU that included six nurses and

116

a dedicated critical care physician based on a previously published model [15]. Hospital

117

staff are either uncontaminated (SU) or contaminated (SC), representing the presence of

118

infectious material on their hands or person. Patients, similarly, are either uncolonized

119

(PU) or colonized (PC).In the baseline model, patients are assumed to mix randomly with

120

healthcare workers (HCWs) in the ICU, with no distinction between the nurses or the

121

intensivist (Fig. 1).

122

Three alternative models were created to compare how different population

123

structures within the ICU impacted MRSA acquisitions when relaxing the random mixing

124

assumption. The “Nurse-MD” model retained random mixing but separated the

125

intensivist from the nursing staff (Fig. 2). Separation of the physician also allowed the

126

interactions between healthcare workers and the patients to be more realistic, using

127

role-specific contact rates with patients, rather than a generic behavior that was the

128

weighted average of nurse and physician contact rates. This resulted in physicians

129

having less direct care tasks (touching the patient or their immediate surrounding

130

environment) involving patients when compared to either nurses or the generic

131

healthcare workers in the SST model. This model thus had six compartments within it:

132

the number of patients either colonized (PC) or uncolonized (PU), the number of nurses

133

either contaminated (NC) or uncontaminated (NU), and the two additional compartments

134

representing the physician as either contaminated (DC) or uncontaminated (DU).

135

The second alternative model, the Metapopulation model, further segregated the

136

healthcare workers by assigning each nurse a specific group of patients (one nurse for

137

every three patients) and assuming the nurse cared exclusively for those patients. This

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19002402; this version posted August 2, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

138

practice is common in many ICUs for continuity of care, familiarity, and scheduling

139

purposes, and may be assumed to predominantly care for those patients. The model’s

140

compartments thus become further divided into six subpopulations, with the physician

141

acting as a bridge between them by visiting all patients. (Fig. 3). This model structure

142

creates a metapopulation that is closer to the actual organizational structure. This

143

model does not assume full random mixing, but rather only assumes that the nurse

144

visits each patient in their assigned group randomly.

145

Even where nurses are assigned a specific group of patients, a nurse will have

146

some interaction with patients outside their assigned group due to cross coverage, staff

147

breaks, or patient care tasks that require more than one nurse to perform. The final

148

extension of this model adds an additional parameter, g, to represent the amount of time

149

a nurse spends in their assigned group, with the remainder of the time spent moving

150

randomly among patients outside their assignment. In doing so, the expanded model

151

effectively hybridizes the previous models, allowing the exploration of intermediate

152

population structures between a purely random mixing model and one with strict

153

assignment. In essence, when g = 1/6, this model replicates the Nurse-MD model, as a

154

nurse is no more likely to spend time with their assigned patients as they are any other

155

five patient groups not assigned to them. Similarly, when g = 1, the model replicates the

156

Metapopulation model, where nurses are strictly confined to treating their assigned

157

patients. The state transitions for each model, and the equations that govern those

158

transitions, may be found in the Supplemental Material as Tables S1, S2 and S3

159

respectively for the SST, Nurse-MD and the expanded Metapopulation model with g

160

respectively.

161

Several assumptions underlie all four models. First, patients are assumed to

162

have a single-occupancy room and not to interact with other patients. The nurses and

163

the physician only interact with the patients and do not interact with each other – or

164

more specifically, do not interact in ways relevant to pathogen transmission. The ICU is

165

considered a “closed ICU” – physicians from outside the ICU do not see patients. The

166

ICU is also considered to be at 100% capacity – if a patient is discharged it is assumed

167

another patient is admitted to the bed immediately [16]. A hand hygiene opportunity

168

occurs after every direct care task and personal protective equipment such as gowns

169

and gloves are changed on entry and exit from the rooms of colonized patients. Note

170

both of these are performed with imperfect compliance (Table 1). Lastly, we assumed

171

that MRSA colonization was detected instantly and with perfect sensitivity and

172

specificity to simplify the model.

173
174
175

Parameterization
Parameter values were obtained predominantly from a previously published

176

model of MRSA transmission in an ICU [17] and are described in Table 1. The

177

alternative models introduce new interactions between the patient and their healthcare

178

team, which required rederivation of some parameters from their original sources [18]–

179

[20]. Specifically, the hand hygiene and gown/glove change rates incorporate nurse and

180

physician specific contact rates, which were recalculated using the same methods as in

181

the previous work.

182
183

Contact rates between patients and healthcare workers were represented by
direct care tasks per hour for each healthcare worker type. Direct care tasks are defined

184

as the physical interaction of the healthcare worker with the patient or their surrounding

185

environment [20]. Effective hand-decontaminations per hour (i) were calculated by the

186

number of direct care tasks and taking into consideration the compliance rate and

187

handwashing efficacy. Effective gown and glove changes per hour (t) were calculated

188

based on the number of visits to a patient per hour and a compliance rate – changing

189

gowns and gloves was assumed to be 100% effective at removing contamination from a

190

healthcare worker.

191

One additional parameter was added to the model differing from previously

192

published work. A natural decolonization rate based on results from the STAR*ICU Trial

193

was added based on evidence that colonization of MRSA is limited, and natural

194

decolonization can occur without targeted treatment or decontamination efforts, moving

195

patients from PC to PU at a low rate absent any direct intervention [8], [21].

196
197
198

Model Simulation
The SST, Nurse-MD and Metapopulation models were simulated to count the

199

number of patients who transitioned to the colonized state (PC) in order to compare the

200

average number of MRSA acquisitions. The models were stochastically simulated using

201

Gillespie’s Direct Method [25] in Python 3.6 using the StochPy package [26] for 1000

202

iterations per model. The initial conditions for each model was set to have no

203

contaminated healthcare workers, either nurses or the physician, and no colonized

204

patients, with initial MRSA infections being seeded from colonized members of the

205

community being admitted to the ICU. Each iteration was run for a single year. The

206

distribution of the acquisitions for each model’s 1000 iterations was visualized in R

v3.5.1 using the vioplot package [27], and the difference between them assessed using

208

a Kruskal-Wallis test. The code for the model simulation and subsequent analysis may

209

be found at github.com/epimodels/Metapopulation_MRSA.

210
211
212

Model Recalibration
In addition to considering model outcomes using a single set of parameters

213

(originally calibrated to the SST model), we also examined the difference in the

214

estimated value of a single free parameter which could be fit within each model. The

215

purpose of this recalibration is two-fold. First, it allows for a comparison of the models in

216

a setting where their outcomes are equal. Second, it allows us to examine how each

217

model form might influence the value of an estimated parameter – important information

218

in a setting where models may be used to perform statistical inference and estimate

219

intervention efficacy. The parameter chosen for this recalibration, y, is the probability of

220

an effective colonization of an uncolonized patient from contact between a

221

contaminated healthcare worker.

222

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) [28] was used for the parameter

223

fitting and to obtain an approximate Bayesian posterior of y for the SST, Nurse-MD and

224

Metapopulation models. This method samples a candidate value from a prior

225

distribution, performs the model simulation using that candidate, and compares a

226

summary statistic from that simulation to a target statistic. The candidate value is

227

accepted if the simulation’s summary statistic equals the target statistic ± an error term

228

e. This is performed repeatedly, and the resulting distribution of accepted candidates is

229

an approximation of a Bayesian posterior distribution.

230

For this analysis, the target number of acquisitions was set to 5.94 acquisitions

231

per 1,000 person-days with an e of 15%, matching the rate seen in the control arm of a

232

large randomized clinical trial on MRSA prevention during the study period [17]. A

233

uniform prior bounded by 0.0 and 1.0 was used, and 1,000,000 candidate parameters

234

were drawn from this distribution to obtain the approximated Bayesian posterior of y for

235

each model, using a simulation procedure similar to the one described above. For

236

comparison between models, the median of this distribution was used as the value for

237

y.

238
239
240

Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
In addition to assessing the difference in raw acquisitions in each model, we

241

assessed the sensitivity of this outcome to changes in the model’s parameters. All

242

parameters in the model were allowed to vary uniformly ±50% of their original values,

243

and 100,000 parameter combinations were simulated for each model. For each model,

244

the recalibrated value for y was used in order to ensure the models were compared

245

against a consistent acquisition rate. The number of acquisitions in each simulation was

246

then normalized as a percentage-change from the mean number of acquisitions. Linear

247

regression was used on the normalized acquisition rate to determine the percentage

248

change in acquisitions due to a single-percentage change in each parameter value.

249

A more structural sensitivity question within the Metapopulation model was

250

explored by varying the amount of time a nurse spends exclusively with their assigned

251

group vs. other patients on the ward, g. The Metapopulation model including g was

252

simulated 10,000 times, drawing a value of g for each iteration from a uniform

253

distribution bounded by 1/6 and 1. A segmented Poisson regression model was then fit

254

to detect any thresholds in the value of g where it’s relationship to the rate of MRSA

255

acquisitions notably changed, or if the transition between the Nurse-MD model (g=1/6)

256

and the Metapopulation model (g=1) was linear. This model incorporated linear and

257

quadratic terms for g and allowed the model to choose any number of break points.

Results

260

Model Comparison

261

When using the same parameter set (calibrated to the SST model), the

262

probability density and average number of MRSA acquisition were significantly different

263

between the SST, Nurse-MD and Metapopulation models (c2 = 1796.8, df = 2, p >

264

0.001) (Fig. 4). Using the SST model as the baseline for comparison, a decrease in the

265

average number of MRSA acquisitions were observed in both the separate Nurse-MD

266

model and the Metapopulation model. By separating the physician from the nurses, the

267

mean acquisitions decreased 20.7% from 40.6 acquisitions to 32.2 acquisitions,

268

respectively. The Metapopulation model experienced a 51.7% decrease from the

269

original SST model at 19.6 acquisitions.

270
271
272

Model Recalibration
The model parameter y (psi) (the probability of effective colonization of an

273

uncolonized patient from contact with a contaminated healthcare worker) was used to

274

calibrate the models. Calibration of the SST model resulted in the median value of the

275

parameter of 0.024 (95% Credible Interval: 0.016, 0.034). The Nurse-MD model results

276

were very similar to the SST model, with a median value of 0.029 (95% Credible

277

Interval: 0.019,0.042). In contrast, the Metapopulation model had a median y value of

278

0.046 (95% Credible Interval: 0.032, 0.07), both a substantially higher estimate than the

279

other models and one in which the bounds of the credible interval did not contain the

280

other estimates. The altered contact patterns in the Metapopulation model thus needs

281

substantially higher per-contact colonization probabilities to sustain the same level of

282

contact.

283
284

Sensitivity Analysis

285

While the Metapopulation model resulted in fewer acquisitions, certain

286

parameters were found to affect the model outcomes to a larger magnitude when

287

compared to the other models. The three parameters in SST model showing the largest

288

proportional change (> 0.20) in cumulative acquisitions (Fig. 5a): contact rate (r),

289

probability of patient colonization (y), and hand-decontamination (i). Similar findings

290

were also found in the Nurse-MD model, though generally only for the nurse-specific

291

parameters (Fig. 5b). The doctor-specific parameters had little effect on the model

292

outcomes. Only one parameter of the Metapopulation model had a large change in

293

cumulative acquisitions > 0.20 – the nurse-specific contact rate. However, the

294

parameters with the largest effects were consistent with the previous two models (Fig.

295

5c).

296

The directionality of the overall change in cumulative acquisitions by parameter is

297

an important measure of model stability and correct parameter estimates, as this

298

reflects whether the models qualitatively give the same results as to whether or not a

299

particular parameter value changing results in an increase or decrease in MRSA

300

acquisitions, even if the models disagree as to the specific value of that change. All of

301

the parameters between the models are consistent in terms of directionality, with the

302

Metapopulation model having a smaller change in magnitude of the cumulative

303

acquisitions (Fig. 5d).

The relationship between g and MRSA acquisitions was non-linear (Fig. 6), with

307

progressively higher values of g resulting in drastically reduced rates of MRSA

308

acquisition. The segmented Poisson regression model identified a single change point,

309

g*, at 0.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.37, 0.42). Values below g* were well

310

approximated by the Nurse-MD model, and values above it rapidly approached the

311

stricter assignment of the Metapopulation model.

Discussion
Developing interventions to reduce the spread or transmission of antibiotic-

315

resistant pathogens, such as MRSA, is an important public health and healthcare goal

316

due to costly on-going hospitalizations and difficulty of treatment. Mathematical models

317

are an important tool in the development of these interventions, but only if they can

318

represent the population and transmission dynamics of a hospital.

319

One important aspect of the highly structured hospital population is the

320

interaction between patients and healthcare workers. Nurses in particular are typically

321

assigned to a group of patients within a particular shift, suggesting the possibility of

322

modeling a hospital unit as a metapopulation. We developed a model using a

323

metapopulation structure that explores how nurses-to-patient interactions may affect the

324

transmission of pathogens in an ICU setting.

325

As compared to a model that assumes random mixing, which dominate the

326

epidemiological compartmental model literature, a more structured metapopulation

327

appears to be warranted when modeling MRSA within an ICU. The random mixing

328

assumption allows a higher degree of interaction with the patients and healthcare

329

workers, resulting in an over-estimation of both the overall rate of MRSA acquisition and

330

an over-estimation of the impact of interventions.

331

While the models considered in this study had similar parameter sensitivity in

332

terms of the direction of changes, the more highly structured models were relatively less

333

sensitive. In all cases, the contact rate (r), probability of patient colonization (y), and

334

hand-decontamination (i) parameters had the largest impact, consistent with many of

335

the known drivers of infection rates within hospitals.

336
337
338

Conclusion
When combined, these results suggest that while compartmental models that

339

assume random mixing and those that have more structured populations may give

340

qualitatively the same answer as to the benefit of an intervention, the magnitude of

341

these estimates may vary considerably, which has implications for cost-effectiveness

342

models and other studies that rely on these estimates. Additionally, if the interventions

343

suggested by the model are implemented in practice, the performance of the

344

intervention may differ from the model’s predictions due to the choice of population

345

structure. Finally, these results show that fitted parameters can vary considerably even

346

for very similar models, suggesting even mild changes in model form necessitate

347

refitting, and parameter estimates are not transportable from one model to another

348

model with a differing population structure.

349

Even within a highly structured population, there are events that will lead to the

350

interactions outside the normal structure. In an ICU setting, it is foreseeable that events

351

like emergencies, breaks, or cross-coverage of nurses will occur with a reasonable

352

degree of frequency. Our model suggests that even relatively small increases in the rate

353

at which these interactions occur can have outsized impacts on MRSA rates. This

354

finding has broad implications for staffing levels and hospital policy and may provide an

355

avenue for reducing MRSA rates that does not rely on individual-level actions.

356

This study has several limitations. While the Metapopulation model is a more

357

granular representation of a hospital population than the more-common SST model, it

358

too is a simplification. Similarly, the parameter estimates used in the model are

359

imperfect. In particular, it is likely that the hand hygiene rate is likely higher than the

360

rates occurring in many hospitals, as reported rates are often substantially inflated.

361

However, these estimates are drawn primarily from the established literature, and

362

represent the field’s best understanding of the underlying processes.

363

Other limitations include the structure of the model – it focuses specifically on

364

healthcare worker and patient interactions and does not account for interactions with

365

individuals other than nurses and the physician. For example, interactions among

366

patients, visitation by family and friends, medical or radiological technicians performing

367

a specific procedure, etc. are not represented. Similarly, transmission purely through

368

environmental contamination is not represented.

369

Hospital settings are characterized by highly structured populations and very

370

limited types of interactions. Despite this, these environments are rarely modeled as

371

metapopulations, especially at the ward level. This study shows that the random mixing

372

assumption results in an over-estimation of both the overall rate of MRSA acquisition

373

and an over-estimation of the impact of interventions as expressed as changes in model

374

parameter values. In contrast, a metapopulation model tends to result in proportionately

375

lower acquisition rates and somewhat more attenuated responses to changes in

376

parameters. These findings are consistent with observations of the effect of

377

metapopulations in the disease ecology literature. These results suggest that, even at

378

small scales, models that assume random mixing may be inappropriate and result in an

379

overestimation in both acquisition rates and the impact of interventions.
