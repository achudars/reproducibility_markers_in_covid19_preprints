ABSTRACT

Background/Objectives: We aim to confirm the association between the high risk score on
bispectral electroencephalogram (BSEEG) and mortality by comparing outcomes for those with
“diffuse slowing” and normal findings on standard EEG.

Design: This is a retrospective study conducted with patient chart data from March 2015 to
March 2017.

Setting: Single center study at a tertiary care academic hospital in the Midwest region of the
USA.

Participants: 1069 subjects aged 55 years and older who were on an inpatient floor or intensive
care unit and received a standard 24-hour EEG.

Measurements: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365- days.
Secondary outcomes were time-to-discharge, and discharge to home.

Results: Patients with “diffuse slowing” on standard EEG was significantly associated with 30-,
90-, 180-, and 365-day mortality (P < .001) compared to those with normal EEG findings when
controlling for age, sex, and Carlson Comorbidity Index. Those with diffuse slowing also had a
longer time to discharge (P < 0.001) and were less likely to discharge to home (P < 0.001) when

controlling for the same factors. Findings were similar when limiting the study to only patients
whose clinical status indicated “awake” at time of EEG, except for 30-day mortality.

Conclusion: Our findings show that a standard EEG finding of “diffuse slowing” for inpatients
55 year or older is associated with greater mortality. This study strengthens the importance of
the association found between high BSEEG score and mortality.

Introduction
Delirium is defined as an acute decline in attention and either disorganized thinking or altered
level of consciousness with a fluctuating course.(1) Delirium can be considered to be acute brain
failure(2) and is thought to be caused by many factors, including drugs, infections, central
nervous system (CNS) insults,(3) sleep disturbance,(4) metabolic disturbances(5), and pain.(6)
Advanced age and comorbidities predispose patients to developing delirium following any of the
above insults.(7) (8) Delirium is very common in older patients, complicating about a third of
hospital stays and often persists following discharge.(9, 10) Moreover, it is associated with
higher morality and worse functional outcomes.(11) Thus, identification of delirious patients to
initiate treatment for potentially reversible causes is vital to improve patient outcomes.

Delirium is typically identified by clinical assessment using the Confusion Assessment Method
(CAM)(12) or similar questionnaire style instruments meant particularly for settings such as the
intensive care unit (CAM-ICU).(13) However, it is frequently underdiagnosed in the hospital
because of its often subtle and varied presentations; agitated, hyperactive delirium represents the
minority of cases while mixed and hypoactive delirium are more common.(9) Reliable
biomarkers of delirium are therefore desirable and needed for better patient care.
Electrophysiological brain signals are a well-known biomarker, with a specificity of 91% in one
study of patients with dementia.(2) In that study, electroencephalogram (EEG) had a low
sensitivity but another study with a more general population found that 96% (50/52) of those
with encephalopathy have “background slowing” indicating that EEG signals read by neurology
experts as “diffuse slowing” is a sensitive marker for encephalopathy.(14)

A finding of “diffuse slowing” on standard EEG is a characteristic feature of delirium and
helpful in identifying delirious patients, including those with an underlying cognitive impairment
such as dementia.(2, 15) Thus, use of EEG could facilitate early identification of delirium.
However, standard EEG is a burdensome procedure with many technical requirements.(16)
Recently our group developed a screening tool for slow brain wave detection, a bi-spectral
bedside EEG (BSEEG) and showed that high BSEEG scores were significantly associated with
delirium.(17, 18) Further, our additional study using the BSEEG identified an association
between high BSEEG score and mortality among elderly inpatients.(19) To confirm the
association between slow brain wave and high mortality, this study aimed to test the association
by investigating patient outcomes for those with “diffuse slowing” on standard EEG.

Methods
Study Oversight
This is a retrospective cohort study to determine the association between EEG findings of
“diffuse slowing” and patient outcomes such as mortality. This study was approved by the
University of Iowa Institutional Review Board.

Patient Population
For the purpose of this study, we reviewed all patients’ records who received a standard 24-hour
EEG as an inpatient at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) from March 2015 to
March 2017. The study team selected potential subjects based on age, including those 55 years
or older in an effort to focus on an elderly population, knowing that this population is more
susceptible to delirium and mortality.

EEG Data Collection
1069 bedside 24-hr standard EEGs completed on inpatients age 55 years or older at UIHC
between March 1st, 2015, and March 1st, 2017 were identified. The first day of EEG recording
was used in our analysis and EEGs from subsequent days were not included. Subjects included
patients from both ICU and medical floors. Age, sex, date of admission, date of EEG, date of
discharge, mortality status, and date of death were recorded for the subject of each report with a
follow-up period of one year. In addition, lists of subjects’ ICD 10 diagnoses were recorded
using data from index admission and all previous admissions. To adjust for the effect of
subjects’ comorbidities on mortality, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were calculated
using subjects’ ICD10 codes.(20, 21) For each EEG performed, a corresponding report
documented by neurologists specialized in electrophysiology was extracted. EEG reports
included data on indication for study, clinical state, EEG recording including background, ictal
and interictal discharges, EEG reactivity, clinical (video) events, description of findings, and
neurologist impression. Based on the neurologist descriptions and impressions, reports were
manually coded by the research team as having (a) a finding of diffuse slowing, diffuse delta and
theta waves, background slowing, or similar terms, (b) a focal finding or lateralization, and (c)
having ictal or seizure findings in fitting with standard terminology.(22)

At the time of EEG recording, the 1069 subjects included were on average 69.5 years old,
median 68 years old, standard deviation 9.7. 53.5% of subjects were male. Average CCI score
was 3.6, median 3, range 0 to 18. Brief reasons given for EEG requests included evaluation for

seizure in 803 (75.1%) subjects, and some form of altered mental status for 285 (26.7%)
subjects.

Outcome Measures
Primary outcome was 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365-day mortality and was identified using chart
review and obituary record. Secondary outcomes included time to discharge following EEG, and
discharge disposition either to home or not to home.

Statistical Analysis
Multivariate regression models were used to determine the association between findings and
outcomes controlling for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score. In additional
analysis, those with diffuse slowing were stratified by clinical status into two groups: those
whose clinical status indicated “awake” and those whose clinical status did not indicate “awake.”
Two-sided P-values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical
analysis was performed using RStudio software, version 1.2.1335.

Results
Group Comparisons
Categorizing subjects, 707 (66.1%) had diffuse slowing, 75 (7.0%) had ictal findings, i.e.
seizures, 502 (47.0%) had some focal finding or lateralization of findings, and 119 (11.1%) had a
normal EEG. There were 372 (34.8%) with diffuse slowing and no focal or seizure findings, 291
(27.2%) with diffuse slowing and some focal finding or lateralization but no seizure, and 145
(13.6%) with a focal finding but no diffuse slowing or seizure.

At 1 year, 15/119 (12.6%) with normal EEG had died, 41/145 (28.2%) of those with focal
findings without diffuse slowing or ictal findings, 138/372 (37.1%) of those with diffuse slowing
without focal or ictal findings, 122/291 (42.0%) of those with diffuse slowing, a focal finding or
lateralization and no ictal finding, and 32/75 (42.7%) of those with ictal findings died. Mortality
at earlier time intervals is visualized with a survival curve, Figure 1, which also displays the
number at risk at intervals of 60 days.
At 1 year, all groups with abnormal findings appear to do worse than those with normal findings
(salmon-colored), with ictal and diffuse slowing apparently similar to one another (teal, blue, and
violet), and worse than those with only focal findings (yellow). These differences are significant
controlling for age, sex, and CCI except that the difference between the diffuse slowing nonfocal
group is not significantly worse than the focal only group (P =0.148), as shown in Table 1.

Diffuse Slowing Analysis
Because the two diffuse slowing groups were similar, we combined the two for further analysis
of mortality and secondary outcomes. We stratified the combined diffuse slowing group by
clinical status into two groups: those whose status included “awake” during EEG recording and
those whose status did not. The survival curve shown in Figure 2 shows the difference from
normals is retained in the awake group and shows a worse outcome among those with diffuse
slowing who were not awake. Multivariate regressions controlling for age, sex, and CCI confirm
that the difference between the awake group and normals is significant at 90 days and beyond.
Table 2 shows results of statistical analysis for mortality outcomes as well as secondary
outcomes, which were also significant. The other group is significantly different from both

normals and from the awake group (P values listed in Table 2 are those for difference from the
awake group).

Discussion
Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring is reportedly used in close to 1/100 mechanically ventilated
patients based on a study from 2008(23) but likely is more common, with another study finding a
10-fold increase from 2004 to 2013.(24) Continuous EEG offers much better detection of seizure
than routine EEG,(25, 26) which is important because mortality is much higher in nonconvulsive
seizures (32-51%), than in those without (13%).(27) While one study did not show better
discharge Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score in those who received cEEG compared to those
who did not, the study did note a difference in GCS at admission, which is consistent with an
improvement related to EEG use although such a retrospective study does not allow for inference
of causation.(28) Other studies do show differences in in-hospital mortality(23, 27) with use of
cEEG, and a randomized control study investigating differences in 6-month mortality between
use of routine and continuous EEG is underway.(29)

While investigation for seizure is often the stated indication for a continuous EEG study(30)
“diffuse slowing” is a common finding and may be given less attention than needed. In our
retrospective study of standard, 24-hour EEG reports in 1069 inpatients, we found that “diffuse
slowing” on cEEG is significantly associated with mortality after an adjustment for age, sex, and
CCI, confirming previous associations between diffuse slowing on EEG and mortality.(31, 32)
In addition, we demonstrated the association persists even when limited to awake patients only.
Our results also indicated that the mortality among the group with “diffuse slowing” is as bad as

that among those with seizure and is worse than those with only focal findings. That the
association becomes significant at 90 days and continues to 1 year in awake patients suggests
that diffuse slowing is not necessarily an acute process which resolves but may be a marker of a
more continual effect beyond its occurrence during hospitalization. Diffuse slowing may be
important to screen for beyond its usual identification as an incidental finding in those evaluated
for seizures. Our study therefore confirms the importance of previously mentioned association
between bispectral EEG and mortality.(19)

Indications for EEG and frequency of outcomes were comparable to a large, three center
study.(33) In this study 75.1% or orders were for underlying seizures while in that study 72.5%70% of indications were for nonconvulsive seizures. There were also similar rates of seizures,
with this study finding seizures at a rate of 7.0% using the first 24 hours of continuous EEG
while that study found seizures at a rate of 12.9% over multiple day recordings, stating around
87.2% of seizures were found in the first day for a 24-hr rate of 11.2%. The difference may be
due to physician ordering patterns.

There were several limitations to the study. The first of which is a feature of the finding of
diffuse slowing itself. Anesthetic agents are very common and can cause diffuse slowing on
EEG. However, we did not collect data on the use of anesthetic agents such as propofol or
benzodiazepines or excluding subjects receiving anesthetic agents because doing so would likely
eliminate many who had diffuse slowing for some other reason, or whose slowing was multiplydetermined. Our study of awake patients mitigates that problem to some extent, as awake

patients are less likely to have received sedatives, and we can be more confident that those in that
group had a finding of diffuse slowing for some other reasons.

Other limitations relate to the generalizability of the study and to treatment applications. The
study was performed at a single center. EEGs used in this study were not ordered at a
standardized time or for a standardized indication, and results may have been affected by
different ordering habits of treating physicians. This study did not include outpatients and the
finding of diffuse slowing may not be associated with mortality in that population. This study
did not determine the meaning of diffuse slowing in biological, biochemical, or anatomical
terms. This study did not compare other potential factors influencing EEG findings such as
specific medical/neurological conditions, medications, or interventions they received following
EEG findings, although inclusion of CCI was meant to help control for comorbidity factors. CCI
is limited in that it does not distinguish between conditions occurring before admission or during
admission so it is unclear if or how they affected the use of EEG. We did not compare patients
who didn’t receive EEGs and/or those who received only routine EEGs. This study does not
demonstrate that identifying diffuse slowing or other abnormal findings leads to changes in
management or outcomes.

Conclusion
Our findings show that an EEG finding of “diffuse slowing” in the inpatient setting for patients
55 year or older is associated with greater mortality, in fact similar to mortality found in those
with seizures. Our study suggests that the finding of diffuse slowing on EEG, which is a
characteristic EEG feature for delirium, is an important clinical marker for predicting mortality

and therefore bispectral EEG may become a useful screening tool for elderly patients if
identification of diffuse slowing can lead to better outcomes.
