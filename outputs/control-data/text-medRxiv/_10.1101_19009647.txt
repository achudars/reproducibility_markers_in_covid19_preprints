Abstract
Understanding exposures of cefepime, a β-lactam antibiotic, is crucial for developing regimens to achieve
optimal exposure and improved clinical outcomes. This study sought to develop and evaluate a unified
population pharmacokinetic model in both pediatric and adult patients receiving cefepime treatment.
Multiple physiologically relevant models were fit to pediatric and adult subject data. To evaluate the final
model performance, a withheld group of twelve pediatric and two separate adult populations were assessed.
Seventy subjects with a total of 604 cefepime concentrations were included in this study. All adults (n=34)
on average weighed 82.7 kg and displayed a mean creatinine clearance (CrCL) of 106.7 mL/min. All
pediatric subjects (n=36) had mean weight and CrCL of 16.0 kg and 195.64 mL/min, respectively. A
covariate-adjusted two compartment model described the observed concentrations well (population model
R2, 87.0%; Bayesian model R2, 96.5%). In the evaluation subsets, the model performed similarly well
(population R2, 84.0%; Bayesian R2, 90.2%). The identified model serves well for population dosing and
as a Bayesian prior for precision dosing.

Cefepime population pharmacokinetics
49

1. Introduction

50

Cefepime is a commonly utilized antibiotic for nosocomial infections. Rising resistance, manifesting as

51

increased cefepime minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs), has led to more frequent clinical failures [1,

52

2]. In order to advise clinical outcomes according to MIC, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute

53

(CLSI) updated the susceptibility breakpoints and then created a category of susceptible-dose dependent for

54

MICs of 4 and 8 mg/L for Enterobacteriaceae spp. [3]. Achieving goal pharmacokinetic exposures to

55

effectively treat these higher MICs can require a precision dosing approach.

56
57

Cefepime, like other β-lactams, has pharmacodynamic activity governed by ‘time-dependent’ activity. The

58

fraction of time that the unbound drug concentration exceeds the MIC (fT>MIC) for the dosing interval is the

59

pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) efficacy target for cefepime [4], and a target of 68%-74% has

60

been established [5]. For the currently approved cefepime product and combination agents in the pipeline

61

[6, 7], understanding cefepime disposition and variability is crucial to optimally treat the patients. Since

62

inter- and intra-patient pharmacokinetic variability can impact the achievement of pharmacodynamic goals,

63

understanding the precision of population dosing is important. Further, to fully realize precision dosing,

64

individualized models (e.g. Bayesian models) are needed. Once developed, these models will form the

65

basis for adaptive feedback and control strategies when paired with real time drug assays.

66
67

The purpose of this study was to: 1) develop and evaluate a unified cefepime population PK model for

68

adult and pediatric patients, and 2) construct an individualized model that can be utilized to deliver

69

precision cefepime dosing.

2. Material and methods

71

2.1 Study Populations

72

Data from four clinical cefepime PK studies representing unique groups of patients were compiled.

73

Subject demographics and study methodologies have been previously described [8-11]. In brief,

74

populations represented were febrile neutropenic adults with hematologic malignancies [10, 11], those with

75

critical illness [9] and children with presumed or documented bacterial infections [8]. For the two studies

76

that evaluated adults with neutropenic fever, Sime et al. prospectively enrolled 12 patients receiving

77

chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant who subsequently developed febrile neutropenia and were

78

administered maximum doses of cefepime [10]. A total of 53 cefepime plasma concentrations in

79

presumably steady-state dosing intervals (third, sixth, and ninth) were analyzed for PK target attainment.

80

Whited et al. prospectively studied similar patients (n=9) who were admitted to hematology-oncology

81

services and were receiving cefepime at maximum dosage for febrile neutropenia [11]. Cefepime PK

82

samples were obtained during steady state and analyzed for population parameters. Critically ill adults

83

were studied by Roberts et al. as a prospective multinational PK study and included 14 patients who

84

received cefepime [9]. Lastly, Reed et al. characterized cefepime PK in hospitalized pediatric patients

85

(above 2 months of age) who received cefepime as monotherapy for bacterial infections [8]. For our study,

86

only those who received intravenous cefepime were included for model development.

87
88

2.2 Model Building Populations

89

Adult (n=34) and partial pediatric (n=36) subjects were utilized for PK model building (Fig. 1) while model

90

evaluation was performed with other datasets consisting of independent adult (n=25) and pediatric (n=12)

91

patients. Pediatric patients from Reed et al. [8] were randomized into the model building or the evaluation

92

dataset. All clinical patient level data included age, weight, and serum creatinine (SCr). An estimated

93

creatinine clearance (CrCL) was calculated for each patient [12]. The Cockcroft Gault formula served as a

94

standardized descriptor for elimination rate constant (Supplemental Fig. 1). This study was exempted by

95

the Institutional Review Board at Midwestern University Chicago College of Pharmacy.

Cefepime population pharmacokinetics
98

To construct the base PK models, the Nonparametric Adaptive Grid (NPAG) algorithm [13, 14] within the

99

Pmetrics (Version 1.5.2) package [14] for R [15] was utilized. Multiple physiologically relevant one- and

100

two compartmental PK models were built and assessed. The one-compartment structural model included

101

an intravenous cefepime dose into and parameterized total cefepime elimination (Ke) from the central

102

compartment (VC). The two-compartment model included additional parameterizations of

103

intercompartmental transfer constants between central and peripheral compartments (KCP and KPC). In

104

candidate models, total cefepime elimination was explored according to full renal and partial renal

105

clearance (CL) models [i.e. non-renal elimination (KeIntcpt) and renal elimination descriptor (Ke0

106

vectorized as a function of glomerular filtration estimates)] [6, 16].

107
108

Assay error was included into the model using a polynomial equation in the form of standard deviation (SD)

109

as a function of each observed concentration, Y (i.e. SD = C0 + C1 · Y). Observation weighting was

110

performed using gamma (i.e. error = SD · gamma), a multiplicative variance model to account for extra

111

process noise. Gamma was initially set at 4 with C0 and C1 equal to 0.5 and 0.15, respectively.

112
113

Covariate relationships were assessed using the ‘PMStep’ function in Pmetrics by applying stepwise linear

114

regressions (forward selection and backwards elimination) of all covariates on PK parameters.

115

Additionally, a priori analyses examined the effect of covariates (e.g. weight, CrCL) on cefepime

116

elimination rate constant (Ke) because of their known importance in describing cefepime disposition [6, 17,

117

18]. Weight and CrCL were standardized to 70 kilogram (kg) and 120 mL/min, respectively. Further, an

118

allometric scaler was applied to standardized weight (i.e. (quotient of weight in kg divided by 70 kg raised

119

to the 0.75th power) as a covariate adjustment to Ke (Supplemental Fig. 1). Ultimate model retention was

120

governed according to criteria described below.

121
122

The best structural and error model was identified by the change in objective function value (OFV)

123

calculated as differences in -2 log-likelihood (-2LL), with a reduction of 3.84 in OFV corresponding to p

124

<0.05 based on chi-square distribution and one degree of freedom. Further, the best-fit model was selected

125

based on rule of parsimony and the lowest Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) scores. Goodness-of-fit of

Cefepime population pharmacokinetics
126

the competing models were evaluated by regression on observed vs. predicted plots, coefficients of

127

determination, and visual predictive checks. Predictive performance was assessed using bias and

128

imprecision in both population and individual prediction models. Bias was defined as mean weighted

129

prediction error; imprecision was defined as bias-adjusted mean weighted squared prediction error.

130

Posterior-predicted cefepime concentrations for each study subject was calculated using individual median

131

Bayesian posterior parameter estimates. Using Bayesian posterior-predicted concentrations (at every 0.2 h)

132

from the final model, noncompartmental analyses (NCA) were performed to estimate additional PK

133

parameters [i.e. half-life, clearance (CL)].

134
135

2.4 Model Evaluation

136

To evaluate the final adjusted model, the NPAG algorithm [13, 14] was employed to assess the

137

performance with separate data sets (Fig. 1). The population joint density from the final adjusted model

138

were employed as Bayesian prior for the randomly withheld pediatric and adult data. In the evaluation

139

process, structural model, model parameters, assay error, and observation weighting were unchanged.

140

Goodness-of-fit of the competing models were determined as described above.

141
142

2.5 Simulations and probability of target attainment (PTA)

143

Simulation was performed to examine the exposures predicted by the final adjusted PK model [14, 19].

144

Covariate values were fixed per subject based on arithmetic means of observed weight and CrCL for adult

145

and pediatric in the model development populations. Monte Carlo sampling was performed from the

146

multimodal, multivariate distribution of parameters with limits fixed by the bounded parameter space.

147

Maximum dosing regimens were simulated for adult and pediatric populations: 2 grams every 8 hours (h)

148

infused over 0.5 h and 50 mg/kg every 8 h infused over 0.5 h. Protein binding of 20% (i.e. 80% free

149

fraction of total cefepime dose) was accounted for in predicting 48-h cefepime concentrations [6]. For each

150

scenario, 2,000 parameter sets or patients were generated. PK/PD target of fT>MIC ≥ 68% was utilized

151

across doubling MICs of 0.25-32 mg/L over the first 48 h of cefepime therapy [5]. Estimates are provided

152

from the first 24 h of simulations as timely administration of effective antimicrobial agents is associated

153

with increased survival [20].

3. Results

156

3.1 Demographics

157

A total of 70 clinically diverse subjects, contributing 683 cefepime concentrations, were included in this

158

study (n=45 subjects for model development; n=25 subjects for evaluation). Adult subjects (n=34) had a

159

mean weight [SD] of 82.7 kg [21.5] and mean CrCL [SD] of 106.7 mL/min [58.4]. For the pediatric cohort

160

(n=36), means [SD] of weight and CrCL were 16.0 kg [16.1] and 195.64 mL/min [40.5], respectively.

161

Adult subjects ranged in age from 22-82 years (mean, 55.4 years) while pediatric subjects ranged from

162

approximately 2 months to 16 years of age (mean, 3.9 years).

163
164

3.2 PK model selection, parameters, and evaluation

165

A total of 604 cefepime observations were available for analysis. Cefepime concentrations ranged from

166

0.5-249.7 μg/mL. The base one- and two-compartment models (no covariate adjustment) produced

167

reasonable fits for observed and Bayesian posterior-predicted cefepime concentrations (R2=84.7% and

168

85.2%, respectively), but population estimates were unsatisfactory (R2=22.7% and 27.8%, respectively)

169

(Table 1). After standardizing weight (to 70 kg) without an allometric scaler in the base two-compartment

170

model, fits for both population and Bayesian posterior estimates against the observed data improved

171

(R2=60.7% and 96.5%, respectively; OFV change, 4). Bias and imprecision for Bayesian posterior fits

172

were -0.18 and 1.12, respectively. When covariates (i.e. weight to volume of distribution and Ke; CrCL to

173

Ke) and the allometric scaler were applied in the two-compartment model, Bayesian posteriors fit well

174

(R2=96.5%; Fig. 2 right) with low bias and imprecision (-0.15 and 1.07, respectively), and population PK

175

model produced good fits of the observed cefepime concentrations (R2=87.0%, bias=0.53,

176

imprecision=7.75; Fig. 2 left). The OFV change from the weight-adjusted, two-compartment model to

177

final model was significant at -34 (p<0.05) (Table 1). Thus, a two-compartment model with weight and

178

CrCL as covariate adjustment and allometric scaling was selected as the final PK model. The population

179

parameter values from the final PK model are summarized in Table 2. Structural model and differential

180

equations that define the population PK are listed in Supplemental Materials. The population parameter

value covariance matrix can be found in Table 3. For the evaluation subset, Bayesian priors resulted in

182

reasonably accurate and precise predictions (population R2=84.0%, Bayesian R2=90.2%; Fig. 3).

184

3.3 Simulation and PTA

185

Results of PTA analysis are shown in Table 4 and Figure 4 for the first 24 h of therapy. Two cefepime

186

regimens were utilized to simulate PTA for adult and pediatric subjects. Cefepime dosage of 2 grams every

187

8 h infused over 30 minutes produced PTAs of >90% for MICs of 0.25-2 mg/L while a more than 2-fold

188

drop of PTA was observed from MIC of 4 mg/L to 8 mg/L. The second cefepime regimen of 800 mg every

189

8 h infused over 30 minutes achieved PTA of >90% only at an MIC of 0.25 mg/L, PTA at 81.1% at MIC of

190

0.5 mg/L and performs poorly across subsequent higher doubling MICs.

4. Discussion

192

This study created a population and individual PK model for adult and pediatric patients and can serve as a

193

Bayesian prior for precision dosing. When paired with a real time assay for cefepime, this model will

194

allow for precise and accurate predictions of cefepime disposition via adaptive feedback control. In the

195

absence of real time assays, these cefepime PK parameters facilitate more accurate population-based dosing

196

strategies. Previous work by Rhodes et al. has shown an absolute difference of approximately 20% in

197

survival probability across the continuum of achieving 0-100% fT>MIC in adult patients with Gram-negative

198

bloodstream infections, thus understanding the dose and re-dosing interval necessary to achieve optimal PK

199

exposures should greatly improve clinical outcomes for patients treated with cefepime [5].

200
201

Individualized dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of β-lactam antibiotics (e.g. cefepime) are

202

critically important to achieving optimal drug exposure (i.e. optimal fT>MIC as the PK/PD target) and

203

improving clinical outcomes [4, 21, 22]. Precision medicine has been named as a major focus for the

204

National Heath Institute with $215 million invested [23], yet precision medicine has mostly focused on

205

genomic differences [24, 25]. Precision dosing is an important facet of precision medicine, and renewed

206

efforts in precision dosing in the real-world setting are being pursued [26]. Cefepime is a highly relevant

207

example. While rigorous reviews and analyses are conducted during the development phase of an

208

antibiotic, dose optimization is far less ideal for the types of patients who ultimately receive the drug. This

209

is highlighted by the fact that although cefepime-associated neurotoxicity is rare. This serious and

210

potentially life-threatening adverse event has been increasingly reported, yet few strategies exist for

211

optimizing and delivering precision exposures [27, 28]. Lamoth et al. conducted a study to investigate the

212

PK/PD threshold for cefepime-associated neurotoxicity [29]. Their final model predicted that a cefepime

213

trough concentration of ≥22 mg/L (p=0.05) has a 50% probability of predicating neurotoxicity. In contrast,

214

Rhodes et al. performed simulations from literature data and found that such threshold by Lamoth et al. is

215

suboptimal as a predictive trough cutpoint [30]. Moreover, high intercorrelation amongst all PK

216

parameters (i.e. AUCSS, CMAX, and CMIN) was observed by Rhodes et al., suggesting more work is needed to

217

establish PK/TD profile for cefepime. Similarly, Huwyler et al. found a different trough (≥35 mg/L) as the

218

predictive cefepime neurotoxic threshold, contrasting that of Lamoth et al. [31]. In addition to

Cefepime population pharmacokinetics
219

complications by these less-than-ideal PK/TD data, clinicians are left to treat patients with extreme age

220

differences, organ dysfunction, and comorbid conditions affect antibiotic PK/PD [22]. These ‘real-world’

221

patients are often under-represented, and thus not well understood, from a PK/PD and PK/TD standpoint

222

during the drug approval process. Bridging to the more typical patients that are clinically treated is

223

important and central to the mission of Precision Medicine. Findings of this study can be used to guide

224

cefepime dosing in these ‘real-world’ patients.

225
226

Several other studies have reviewed population cefepime PK. Sime et al. observed that patients with

227

neutropenic fever had a mean clearance (CL) of 8.6 L/h, mean elimination half-life of 2.7 h [10]. Nicasio

228

et al. studied 32 critically ill patients receiving intravenous cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia

229

and observed that means of total CL and elimination half-life (as calculated from mean total CL and mean

230

volume of distribution) were 7.6 L/h and 2.0 h, respectively [32]. The NCA conducted (in model

231

development adult population) in our study produced similar results (CL, 7.59 L/h; elimination half-life,

232

2.98 h). Shoji et al. studied 91 pediatric patients and observed a mean of CL of approximately 1.86 L/h and

233

a mean elimination half-life of 3.5 h (23). In our pediatric population, means of CL and elimination half-

234

life were 3.1 L/h and 3.0 h, respectively. Our simulation findings are similar to those of Shoji et al. that a

235

maximum pediatric cefepime dosing of 50 mg/kg every 8 h or 12 h did not adequately achieve optimal

236

exposure to target higher MICs. Other studies also performed simulation for PTA with different cefepime

237

regimens and renal functions, Tam et al. found that with a PD target of 67%, 2 grams every 8 h (30-minute

238

infusion) achieved approximately 90% PTA for MIC of 8 mg/L in patients with CrCL of 120 mL/min while

239

2 grams every 12 h achieved barely above 80% PTA for MIC of 4 mg/L in the same population [33].

240

Nicasio et al. also conducted a simulation using a PD target of 50% in the critically ill with varying renal

241

function. Maximum recommended dosage (2 grams every 8 h) in patients with CrCL between 50-120

242

mL/min achieved a PTA of 78.1% at MIC=16 mg/L; however, when the same regimen was infused over

243

0.5 h, the PTA achieved was significantly lower [32]. Collectively, these findings suggest that cefepime

244

exposure is highly variable and may be clinically suboptimal in a large number of patients commonly

245

treated with cefepime. These findings support the need of precision dosing and TDM for β-lactam

246

antibiotics to reach optimal PK/PD target given the high variability in drug exposures.

Cefepime population pharmacokinetics
247
248

Our study is not without limitations. Although a relatively large and diverse cohort was included in model

249

development and evaluation, we did not specifically assess certain subgroups such as patients with

250

morbidly obesity, severe renal dysfunction, etc. These conditions may require patient-specific models.

251

Secondly, many studies to date included “real-world” patients with various disease sates (e.g. neutropenic

253

administration times, etc. were all carefully confirmed. Additional efforts will be needed to evaluate

Cefepime population pharmacokinetics
255

5. Conclusions

256

A unified population model for cefepime in adults and pediatric populations was developed and

257

demonstrated excellent performance on evaluation. Current cefepime dosages are often suboptimal, and

258

population variability is high. Precision dosing approaches and real time assays are needed for cefepime to

259

optimize drug exposure and improve clinical outcomes.
