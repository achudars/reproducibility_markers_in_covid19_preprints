Abstract
Background: Chronic breathlessness profoundly affects quality of life for its
sufferers. Often, reported breathlessness is inconsistent with airway pathophysiology
and objective disease markers. While a mechanistic understanding of this
discordance has thus far remained elusive, factors such as mood, attention and
expectation have all been implicated as important perceptual modulators. Therefore,
here we have developed a model capable of exploring these relationships aiding
patient stratification and revealing clinically-relevant neuro-biomarkers.
Methods: A cohort of 100 participants with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) underwent a comprehensive assessment that included
functional brain imaging while viewing and rating breathlessness-related word cues,
self-report questionnaires and clinical measures.
Results: Using an exploratory factor analysis across psychological and physiological
measures, we identified two distinctive neuropsychological behavioural profiles that
differed across four key factors corresponding to mood, symptom burden, and two
capability measures. These profiles stratified participants into high and low symptom
groups, which did not differ in spirometry values. The low symptom load group
demonstrated greater FMRI activity to breathlessness-related word cues in the
anterior insula.
Conclusions: Our findings reveal two clear groups of individuals within our COPD
cohort, divided by behavioural rather than clinical factors. Furthermore, indices of
depression, anxiety, vigilance and perceived capability were linked to differences in
brain activity within key regions thought to be involved in monitoring bodily
sensations (interoception). These findings demonstrate the complex relationship
between affect and interoceptive processing, providing the foundations for the
development of targeted treatment programmes that harness clinical and symptomrelevant biomarkers.

Introduction
For the millions of people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
asthma, heart failure or cancer, breathlessness is a major source of suffering,
extending pervasively into people’s lives. COPD describes a collection of lung
conditions including bronchitis and emphysema, 85% of which arise as a result of
long-term cigarette smoking. Despite the substantial personal, social and economic
impacts of breathlessness resulting from COPD alone (4.5% of people over 40 have
been diagnosed with COPD according to the British lung foundation and in 2015
5.6% of the worldwide deaths were attributed to COPD [1]), mechanistic
understandings of symptom variability and the discordance between pathophysiology
and subjective perceptions remain elusive.

While traditional thinking has viewed breathlessness as a symptom arising directly
from lung damage or cardiopulmonary stress, recent work in breathlessness has
highlighted the influence of factors such as mood and attention on subjective
perceptions [2]. Furthermore, 40% of people with COPD are thought to experience
clinically relevant anxiety and depression, compared to <10% of the general
population [2]. In addition to these factors, previous experiences, symptom
expectation and the ability to correctly monitor our internal bodily state (also known
as interoception [3, 4]) also appear to play a fundamental role in perceptual
experiences, as outlined by the “Bayesian Brain” hypothesis.

In the Bayesian Brain model, the brain weighs prior expectations against noisy
ascending sensory inputs to determine sensory perception. This perceptual
weighting is thought to be further modulated by emotions and attention [5]. Such
theories are beginning to gain traction and formalising these in terms of their neural
correlates may yet offer a fresh perspective on the challenges of understanding
breathlessness [6, 7].

Thus, breathlessness arises not only from current patho-physiological status of the
lungs and airways, but also depends on the brain's interoceptive networks – those
networks associated with interpreting incoming signals from the body. The production
of breathlessness perceptions arise from a complex product of previous experiences,
the interpretation of internal sensory signals and factors such as emotional status. A
model incorporating this interplay of the behavioural and neuro-psychological
networks may facilitate stratification of patient groups based on brain-related metrics,
offer explanations for symptom discordance and heterogeneity and in turn lead to the
development of targeted treatments within these groups.

Here, we have investigated this relationship by building on our previous work linking
brain activity to breathlessness-related word cues [8, 9] and drawing upon the bigdata techniques of unsupervised machine learning and dimensionality reduction. We
applied

questionnaire, behavioural and physiological dataset and identified the best
combination of measures for describing the breathlessness experience across
individuals. Using dimensionality reduction, we then reduced the measures down to
their underlying factors and used these to stratify the population of individuals with
COPD into subgroups with distinct neuropsychological profiles. Finally we used this
information to probe potential differences in neural processing of breathlessness
expectations between these symptom-based groups.

Methods and Materials
A brief overview of the study methodology is presented here. Full details can be
found within supplementary materials.

Participants
100 participants (36 female, mean age 69 years (49-84 years)) with mild to moderate
COPD (according to GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease]
standards) were recruited to this study immediately prior to their enrolment in a
National Health Service prescribed course of pulmonary rehabilitation. From this
population, 91 participants completed the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
component of the study (Supplement Figure 1). Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants prior to the start of the study. Study approval was
granted by South Central Oxford REC B (Ref: 118784).

Behavioural Measures
Self-report questionnaires: We selected a comprehensive set of questionnaires
designed to probe the experience of living with COPD, focusing particularly on the
potential influence of emotional and behavioural measures.

The following self-report questionnaires were completed and scored according to
their respective manuals: Dyspnoea-12 (D12) Questionnaire [10], Centre for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [11], Trait Anxiety Inventory
(TRAIT) [12], Fatigue Severity Scale [13], St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ) [14], Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale [15], Mobility
Inventory (MI) [16], Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [17], Anxiety Sensitivity Index
Questionnaire (ASI) [18], Catastrophic Thinking Scale in Asthma [19], Pain
Awareness and Vigilance Scale [20].

Emotional Stroop: Participants completed an emotional Stroop task, featuring
breathlessness-related words vs control neutral words matched for length and
frequency (modified from: Reinecke et al., 2011). Participants were required to read
aloud the colour of the word and the reaction time to respond to emotional vs neutral
words was computed. Due to technical issues, Stroop data were collected from a
subgroup of 66 participants.

Physiological Measures: Spirometry and two Modified Shuttle Walk Tests (MSWT)
were collected using standard practices. Participant height and weight was recorded
at each session.

MRI Measures
Image acquisition: Imaging was carried out using a 3T MAGNETOM Trio, A Tim
System (Siemens Healthcare GmbH) using a 12-channel head coil. A T1-weighted
(MPRAGE) structural scan (voxel size: 1 x 1 x 1 mm) was collected and used for
registration purposes. A T2*-weighted, gradient echo planar image (EPI) scan
sequence (voxel size: 3 x 3 x 3 mm) was used to collect functional imaging data
during the word cue task. Field map scans of the B0 field were obtained to aid the
distortion correction of the functional scans

Word cue task: To probe breathlessness-related expectation we examined the
activity of brain regions responding to breathlessness-related word cues and fixed
string non-words, and correlated this to corresponding visual analogue ratings of
anxiety and breathlessness [22]. Ratings were recorded throughout the task and
word presentation order was pseudo-randomized for each session.

Faces task: In the second functional scan, participants were shown human faces for
500ms (drawn from the set described by [23] in blocks of 30 seconds, with fearful or
happy expressions. Participants were asked to identify whether the faces were male
or female. A fixation cross condition was interspersed for 30 seconds between the
happy/fearful blocks of faces. Reaction time and accuracy were recorded throughout
the task.

Analysis
Behavioural Analysis – factor identification
Full correlation matrices were calculated for (z-scored) behavioural (questionnaires)
and physiological scores (spirometry, demographics and MSWT measures) (Table
1), using MATLAB 2017b (Mathworks, Natick, MA). For this analysis, only data from
participants (n=91) who completed both the behavioural and MRI parts of the study

were utilised. The structure of the correlation matrices was examined by applying a
hierarchical cluster model to the data (Figure 1). To formalize the relationships
observed as a result of applying the hierarchical cluster model to the data, an
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted using parallel analysis, oblique
rotation and a maximum likelihood estimation. Model selection criteria included
loading variables above 0.4 with no cross loading or freestanding variables, and
significant X2/df ratio with Tucker-Lewis Index (TL-index) close to 1 and Root Mean
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) < 0.06. Models were fit using Lavaan
version 0.6-1 (Rosseel, 2012) in R version 3.2.1 (R Core Team).

factor, identified via the EFA in the factor identification process, reducing datadimensionality. This created one composite score per participant for each factor. This

information was input into the hierarchical cluster algorithm, alongside anonymized
subject identities. A scree plot was used to identify the most statistically distinct
groupings of participants (Supplementary Figure 3).

Stroop
Stroop scores were calculated for each individual by subtracting the mean reaction
time in response to neutral words from that of the social-threat words and
breathlessness-threat words. This was carried out separately for the masked and
unmasked conditions. Repeated measures ANOVAs were carried out separately for
word type presented under masked or unmasked conditions. Labels, corresponding
to high and low symptom load, assigned during the participant stratification process,
were then applied to this group. Repeated measures ANOVAs were carried out
separately for word type presented under masked or unmasked conditions using
group identity as the predictor variable.

Imaging Analysis
Image processing was carried out using the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging of Brain Software Library (FMRIB, Oxford, UK; FSL version
5.0.8; https://ww.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/), MATLAB (R2017b) and associated custom
scripts.

Functional MRI Analysis
MRI processing was performed using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool, within the
FSL package).

Word task lower-level analysis
At the individual subject level, a general linear model (GLM) was created with
explanatory variables (EVs) for word or non-word presentation, and two de-

meaned EVs modeling the reported breathlessness and anxiety response to the
word cues. An additional explanatory noise variable was included to model the
period during which the participant responded using the VAS. In addition to the
mean contrasts for each of the EVs, differential contrasts were also created for
activity in response to breathlessness-related words greater than that for nonwords and for non-words greater than that for words.

Faces task lower-level analysis
At the individual subject level, a GLM was created with EVs for stimulus
presentation periods of happy and fearful faces, along with the associated (demeaned) reaction times. Two additional EVs were created to model participant
(de-meaned) accuracy in identifying whether the presented faces were male or
female. In addition to the mean contrasts for each of the EVs, differential contrasts
were also created for activity in response to fearful faces greater than that for
happy faces.

Group level analysis
Mean voxelwise difference in activity were calculated for the words > non-words,
non-words > words and fearful faces > happy faces, happy faces > fearful faces
contrasts between groups of participants (corresponding to high and low symptom
load) identified within the hierarchical cluster model at the participant stratification
stage. Demeaned age and sex values were modeled as regressors of no interest.
Significance testing was performed using FSL’s Randomize tool [24] – which
carries out rigorous permutation testing, with threshold free cluster enhancement
(TFCE) at p<0.05. Based on a priori hypotheses a region of interest approach,
examining differential activity specifically within the amygdala (including 10mm
radius spherical masks of a left amygdala region (-14/-6/-8) and its right
hemisphere counterpart) was also taken.

Results

Of the 23 variables entered into the hierarchical cluster model (Figure 1), 14 were
found to significantly contribute to a description of the variance within the COPD
population. Significant variables included: Anxiety, Depression; St George – Impact,
D12, Catastrophising, Vigilance, Fatigue, St George – Symptom, MSWT HR change,
MSWT Distance, St George – Activity, MRC, Avoidance – Alone and MRC
Avoidance - Accompanied. These groups of measures are demonstrated in Figure 1.

The final 4 factor model (shown overlaid onto Figure 1) was validated after testing for
models of 2, 3 and 4 factors, (X2 = 65.85, df = 41, p<0.008; TLI=0.9; RMSEA=0.05).
The factor diagram shown in Figure 2 shows how 4 latent factors emerged from the
14 variables. Factor 1 is made up of vigilance, catastrophising, fatigue, St George –
Symptoms, St George – Impact and D12. Factor 2 was made up of MSWT Distance,
MSWT HR change and St George – Activity. Factor 3 is composed of two of the
Avoidance sub-scales and MRC scale. Finally Factor 4 consists depression and traitanxiety). The covariance between factors is illustrated by the curved lines in Figure 2,
with Factors 1 and 4 demonstrating the strongest covariance.

The factors identified by EFA model fitting were then used to stratify the patient
population via their composite scores on these 4 major factors in a hierarchical
cluster model. A scree plot (Supplementary Figure 3) confirmed that a 2-group
solution was the most distinct. The groupings of participants seems to correspond to
high symptom load and low symptom load across the four factors - with significant
paired distance across the two groups between each factor at p<0.001. This
difference was not driven by differences in spirometry scores (p=0.32).

MRI results
Mean group differences - word task
Robust significant group differences were found in response to the breathlessnessrelated word cues compared to non-words in the anterior insula (Figure 4) when
using non-parametric permutation testing alongside stringent threshold-free cluster
enhancement. The BOLD response within the low symptom group was found to be
higher in this key region in response to breathlessness words versus non-words. No
significant difference was observed within the small volume correction analysis of the
amygdala. Further, more exploratory analysis is presented in Supplementary Figure
6. Participant ratings of the breathlessness-related words were found to be
significantly higher in the high symptom load (p<0.01) compared to the low symptom
load group for both anxiety (wA) (high load 36.7 ± 19.2, low load 10.3 ± 11.2) and
breathlessness (wB) (high load 56.0 ± 11.8, low load 35.4 ± 14.8), measures that
were not used in the classification of the participants into groups.

Mean group differences – faces task
No difference in activity between groups in the condition of fearful versus happy
faces survived. No significant difference was observed within the small ROI analysis
of the amygdala. Additionally no significant difference was found in participant
reaction times to happy (high load 758.57 ± 137.92 (ms), low load 782.09 ± 107.72
(ms)) or fearful faces (high load 742.71 ± 141.87 (ms), low load 773.70 ± 125.71
(ms)) (p>0.05).

In the masked condition, where emotional words were presented and then quickly
followed by a symbol string mask, there was no significant difference between
socially negative words and breathlessness-related words F(1,65)=0.09, p=0.76.
However, in the unmasked condition, where emotional words were clearly visible and
remained unmasked, there was a significant difference in reaction time in response
to socially negative and breathlessness negative words F(1,65)=8.41, p<0.005. In
this unmasked condition, participants responded significantly more slowly to
breathlessness-related words.

Group identity was not found to be a significant predictor of difference in reaction
time between socially negative words and breathlessness-related words in either the
masked (F(1,53)=2.41, p=0.13) or unmasked conditions (F(1,53)=1.68, p=0.20)), nor
were there any differences in reaction time in the neutral condition between the two
groups (p>0.05).

Significant activity was observed in response to the breathlessness-related words
compared to non-words, but not the fearful faces compared to happy faces. To
address whether this could reflect specific breathlessness-related anxiety processing
in this population, a direct contrast between the two conditions is shown in
Supplementary Figure 8. This difference did not survive TFCE.

Discussion
Key findings
In this study we have stratified a group of people with COPD and found differences in
their symptom perception, psychological profiles and brain activity in response to
breathlessness-related word cues. Behaviourally, the two groups can be divided into
high and low scorers on four key factors. These factors could loosely be considered
to consist of one mood factor (Depression & Anxiety), one symptom burden factor
(Vigilance, Catastrophising, Fatigue, St George – symptom, St George – impact,
D12), and two capability factors – one physical (MSWT Distance, MSWT HR & St
George – activity) and one anticipated (Avoidance – alone & accompanied & MRC).
Importantly, no clear patho-physiological basis could be found to explain this group
difference, based on the spirometry and oxygen saturation measures collected in this
study.

Key differences in breathlessness-related brain activity were also found between the
groups. These differences were observed within the anterior insula, a region that has
previously been associated with the processing of bodily sensations and perceptions
[3]. Interestingly, the differences in functional brain activity were only found in relation
to specific breathlessness-related anxiety, with a more general anxiety paradigm
utilising emotional faces revealing no significant differences between the groups,
even when applying a region of interest approach within the amygdala, an area
known to respond to threatening facial stimuli in highly anxious individuals. Indeed,
across the whole group of participants, there was no significant difference in the
brain response to fearful versus happy faces (Supplement Figure 7).

communications between different brain networks, and bottom up sensory
information [6, 7]. Because of the multiple points of entry into this system, when the
system is tipped out of balance, as can be the case in chronic breathlessness,
aiming to pinpoint a single cause of disruption to the system is unlikely to reveal a
universal mechanism in this individualised perception. If we accept that maladaptivebreathlessness can arise as a result of small shifts across a number of domains,
including sensory, psychological and neurophysiological, a broad range of targeted
measures are required to investigate these axes.

While each individual perceives breathlessness differently, based on this data, there
may be subgroups of patients with similar underlying mechanistic disruptions to their
symptom perception. An important first step towards subgroup stratification is to
identify the best combination of measures capable of capturing the dimensions of the
individual breathlessness experience. In the bourgeoning field of computationalpsychiatry, big-data approaches are being applied to multimodal datasets. Where the
conclusions of small sample size studies have been limited by cross population
noise, the increased sensitivity afforded by machine learning techniques and larger
sample sizes is now revealing neuro and behavioural phenotypes in conditions such
as depression [25] and schizophrenia [26]. Such phenotypes may facilitate patient
stratification, predict treatment outcomes and ultimately improve treatment success
rates with personalised treatment plans. While our dataset cannot compare to these
truly “big data” studies, where thousands of measures are available, the techniques
employed here have been appropriately tailored from these studies for our purposes.
In combination with detailed neuroimaging techniques, here we collected behavioural
data from a population of people living with COPD. We sought to capitalise on this
high-dimensionality to better understand breathlessness by uncovering data-trends
ordinarily hidden by noise. While single measures may each offer a partial
description of breathlessness, a more powerful approach is to combine relevant

measures and draw out common factors. Variation across these factors may then
link to neural networks or explain differences between individuals with objectively
similar disease severity.

In this study, unsupervised machine learning algorithms indicated that 14/23
behavioural measures were important descriptors of the population. Collapsing
across these measures revealed 4 key factors, which could loosely be considered to
consist of one mood factor, a symptom burden factor and two capability factors – one
physical and one anticipated. These measures paint an intuitive picture of the lived
experience of breathlessness – what a person feels they can and cannot do, how
their symptoms impact their lives and their general mood. Combining measures,
where each addresses a small part of a larger, potentially biologically relevant factor,
is perhaps the only way to access these concepts, and thus the neural activity that
underlies the system.

The psychological impact of breathlessness-related cues was highlighted by the
significant differences in reaction time observed in response to breathlessnessrelated words compared to socially negative words in an unmasked condition of the
Stroop task. Participants responded more slowly to the breathlessness words, which
could indicate that the salience of the breathlessness words were sufficiently
attentionally demanding to absorb cognitive resources away from the task. This may
reflect the greater attentional load of the breathlessness-related words compared to
the socially negative related words. The finding was restricted to the unmasked
condition suggesting that this may be a conscious process. This effect was not found
to be group specific, although group difference was run on only a sub-sample of the
participants, limiting direct comparisons. However, the absence of a group difference
may also suggest that the impact of the breathlessness does not arise as a result of
aberrant attentional processes.

Interestingly, physiological measures such as spirometry, pack-years and baseline
oxygen saturation were not influential enough within the data variance to be included
in the model, [1]. These findings lend further support to the strong impact of
psychology and associated neural activity on the perception of breathlessness, and
the importance of multimodal assessments.

Stratifying patients based on behaviour
We then considered whether these four behavioural factors could be used to stratify
the study population. The experience of chronic breathlessness is extremely
heterogeneous, and a key question was whether evidence for subgroups could be
revealed after the number of data dimensions were reduced down to just four core
factors. Employing the technique of hierarchical cluster modelling, participants were
grouped according to their scores on the four factors. Two clear groups were
identified and validated via a scree plot, corresponding to high and low symptom
load. Within each group, additional sub-groups could be observed, but participant
numbers were such that these groups could not be easily interrogated further. Such
groupings could of course be considered as existing as part of a broader distribution,
where people fall onto a spectrum of symptoms. However, providing clear
boundaries in this case enables us to initially consider the differences between
people, which may relate to treatment options.

Following on from this, we were interested as to whether these behavioural groups
corresponded to differences in brain activity patterns related to breathlessness. As
part of the study, participants had completed two functional MRI scans – one a
breathlessness-related word-cue task, to probe breathlessness specific expectation,
and one a faces task, to probe general anxiety brain activity. Differences were
observed across the two groups only for the word task. This finding mirrors those of

Rosenkranz et al. [27], who noted that the insula was only activated by diseaserelated negative cues compared to generally-negative cues in a population of asthma
patients.

Greater activity in response to word cues was observed within the anterior insula for
the low symptom burden than high symptom burden. This area is part of the wider
brain network thought to be involved with the affective perception of internal
sensations and stimulus valuation [7]. Furthermore, the anterior insula has been
linked to the processing of subjective feelings [3], and therefore, the greater activity
within the network of Group 1 may be linked to a more coherent representation of
internal sensations, leading to lower anxiety and general symptom burden. Indeed,
the specificity of this group difference to breathlessness supports the theory that this
network is specific and potentially related to sensory interpretations. However, further
studies utilising measures that directly measure symptoms against breathlessness
perceptions would be required to investigate this hypothesis.

To tease apart the mechanisms of breathlessness, the study of perception is
beginning to take on lessons from Bayesian theories to frame itself in terms of priors,
predictions and likelihoods. From this perspective, recent work suggests a complex
interplay between descending top down control from stimulus valuation areas such
as the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial
prefrontal area, and ascending sensory signals received by areas such as
periaqueductal gray, thalamus and posterior insula [9] [5]. Such models could explain
why pulmonary rehabilitation is such an effective treatment for breathlessness,
despite the lack of any effect on lung function Furthermore, reductions in
breathlessness anxiety resulting from pulmonary rehabilitation have been found to
correlate with activity in the insula and anterior cingulate cortex; key areas identified
for stimulus evaluation [9].

Further considerations and limitations
Although the techniques employed here draw upon the big data techniques of
machine learning, the acceptable ratio between variables and participants must be
carefully considered when scaling down these techniques. Factor analysis requires
between 2 and 5 times the number of samples per variable tested and ideally more
than 100 observations. With further subjects it may also be possible to gain sufficient
statistical power to further probe further sub-groups, such as those visible within
Figure 3. Another important caveat of cluster methods is that they examine shared
variance, and so we must remain aware that any of the measures not included in this
model could be highly relevant – but not share any common features with the other
measures.

Incorporating psychological variables into models of breathlessness to investigate
the influence of mood and previous experience enriches our ability to explain
potential influences towards breathlessness perceptions. However, in this crosssectional work, the direction of causality is impossible to infer - are people with low
mood more susceptible to breathlessness anxiety, or do they become low in mood as
a result of their greater symptom burden? Longitudinal population studies would thus
need to be employed to understand any predominating direction within this
relationship.

Conclusion
Breathlessness perception in people living with COPD is highly heterogeneous and
frequently does not match their medically diagnosed disease status. Given the
relatively high prevalence of COPD within the general population addressing this
discrepancy has the potential to meaningfully impact hundreds of thousands of lives.
The results from the current study thus move us towards a more comprehensive
understanding of the contributing components influencing breathlessness perception.
We have identified both perceptual and breathlessness-related brain activity
differences within two subgroups of our COPD patients, demonstrating distinctive
neuro-psychological profiles between those with high and low symptom loads. While
further work is required to elucidate more nuanced subgroups and components
relating to individualised breathlessness perception, we have demonstrated that
incorporating behavioural and neuroimaging measures into enriched models can
offer new perspectives on breathlessness, and move us towards the goal of tailoring
treatment programs for the individual and their lived experience of breathlessness.

Behavioural Measures

Questionnaire Measures
Dyspnoea-12 (D12) Questionnaire: This is a 12-item questionnaire designed to
measure the severity of breathlessness and has been validated for use in patients
with respiratory disease [1].
Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): Depressive
symptoms are commonly observed in patients with respiratory disease. This brief
questionnaire consists of 20 items investigates the symptoms of depression across a
number of factors [2].
Trait Anxiety Inventory (TRAIT): This questionnaire assesses participant’s general
level of anxiety in particular scenarios via 20 questions asking “how anxious you
generally feel” [3].
Fatigue Severity Scale: This 9-point questionnaire quantifies patient fatigue, which
is well documented in its association with COPD [4].

St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ): There are 50 questions in this
questionnaire, which has been developed and validated for use in COPD and
asthma. The questions measure the impact of overall health, daily life and well-being
[5].
Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale: The MRC scale
quantifies perceived difficulty due to respiratory restrictions on a scale of 1 to 5 [6].
Mobility Inventory (MI): This questionnaire collects data regarding the extent to
which a participant avoids certain situations, either alone or accompanied (21-items
in each category) [7].
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: The 17 items of this questionnaire examine selfreported quality, duration and regularity of sleep [8].
Anxiety Sensitivity Index Questionnaire (ASI): This 16-item questionnaire probes
the somatic, cognitive and social facets of anxiety and its harmful consequences.
The ASI has been validated in distinguishing between clinical and non-clinical
populations and demonstrates high test-retest reliability [9].
Catastrophic Thinking Scale in Asthma: This 13-point questionnaire was modified
for this study by substituting the word “asthma” for “breathlessness” in order to
measure catastrophic thinking [10] [11].
Pain Awareness and Vigilance Scale: This questionnaire was modified by
substituting the word “breathlessness” for the word “pain”. The 16-point scale
measures how much a participant focuses their attention onto their breathlessness
[12] [11].

Emotional Stroop
Biased cognitive processing relating to perceived threatening stimuli may relate to
the phenotype of breathlessness in COPD. Attentional bias has been observed in
panic disorder [18], as well as in anxiety and depression, [19], which are highly comorbid with chronic breathlessness. Indeed, in their 2019 paper Sucec and

colleagues suggest that the threat of breathlessness may affect attentional
processing by absorbing the available resources [20]. We assessed whether these
findings could be replicated within the COPD population using an emotional Stroop
task. Emotional words were selected on the basis of patient interactions. The valence
of these words was then tested in a population of 14 control participants and 17
COPD patients. From this pool of words, 12 breathlessness-negative words were
selected and were combined with the 12 socially-negative and 12 neutral words from
[18].

Due to technical issues with the emotional Stroop task (data loss due to

computer malfunction), data was collected from a subgroup of 66 of the 100
participants. Analysis for this task was kept separate from the behavioural correlation
analysis due to the large number of missing data points. Of the 66 participants who
completed the Stroop task, complete MRI data was available for 55 participants.

Stimuli were programmed using e-prime (Psychology Software Tools, 2002) and
consisted of 12 neutral words (e.g. Vase), 12 social-threat words (e.g. Stupid) and 12
breathlessness-threat words (e.g. Choking) presented at font size 24. Stimuli were
presented in six experimental blocks; one for each word type (neutral, social-threat
and breathlessness-threat) in both masked and unmasked conditions. In the masked
condition, target stimuli were presented and then replaced by a symbol string
matched for font size, colour and length after 17ms. Block order was
counterbalanced across participants. Participants were instructed to name the colour
of the word (red, blue or green) as quickly and accurately as possible, with the word
remaining visible to the participant until a response was made. Participant responses
were recorded using a microphone, which was connected to a laptop via a serial
response box. The serial response box converted the initiation of a vocalisation into a
temporal signal, enabling reaction time to be established, while the experimenter

Physiological Measures
A trained respiratory nurse collected spirometry measures of FEV1 and FVC using
Association for Respiratory Technology and Physiology standards. Participants
performed two incremental shuttle walk tests (MSWT), and heart rate and oxygen
saturations (SpO2) were measured immediately before the MSWT and subsequently
every minute until 10 minutes post-exercise (or until participants returned to their
baseline state) using a fingertip pulse oximeter (Go2; Nonin Medical Inc). Before and
after the IWST participants also rated their breathlessness on a modified Borg scale
[21].

Imaging Measures
Word Task
Learned associations can be employed to indirectly probe related brain networks and
the cognitive dynamics of emotional states such as anxiety and fear. A relevant
example could include a healthy person needing to walk up several flights of stairs,
who may think nothing of the experience, whereas for a person with a lung condition
the stairs may be associated with memories of fearful breathlessness. Given
sufficient repeated threatening exposures, the thought alone of climbing stairs may
trigger the networks sub-serving the corresponding anxiety response. In such cases,
the presentation of a cue in the form of a word has been shown sufficient to activate
brain networks related to the action or emotional state associated with this cue. This
task was developed and published by Herigstad and colleagues in 2016 for use in
the COPD population [13]. Word cues were developed in three key stages; firstly in
collaboration with respiratory practitioners, academics and physiotherapists, a set of
30 word cues associated with breathlessness were created. Next, these cues were
provided to patients with COPD alongside a VAS rating scale, allowing patients to
rate how breathless and anxious the situations identified by the cues would make
them feel. Following adjustments based on participant feedback, the word cues were

then computerised and tested in a larger population of COPD patients [13]. Further
validation was carried out in the fMRI environment and by for clinical sensitivity with
comparisons between changes in key questionnaire measures and word-cue rating.
In the first scan, participants were shown a set of breathlessness-related word cues
in a pseudo-randomised order. During the task, participants were presented with a
word cue in white text on a black background for 7 seconds. Participants were then
asked, “how breathless would this make you feel” (wB) and “how anxious would this
make you feel” (wA). To each question participants responded within a 7 second
window using a button box and visual analogue scale (VAS). The response marker
always initially appeared at the centre of the scale, with the anchors “Not at all” and
“Very much” at either end. Before the scan session, participants were given the
opportunity to practice using the button box with a set of test words. A control
condition, used as a baseline measure of activity in response to the presentation of a
visual stimulus was presented 4 times over the course of the scan, consisting of a
string of “XX” with fixed length of 15 characters, and each time was presented for 7
seconds. No rating period followed these control blocks. Subtracting activity in
response to the control condition (i.e. simply the response to any visual stimulation)
from conditions of interest enabled us to examine stimulus-specific activity.

Faces Task
Emotional facial expressions are widely recognised to activate the same neural
pathways as the behavioural emotion conveyed by the expression itself [14]. Fearful
facial expressions, for example, have been shown to correspond to activity within the
amygdala, a region known to modulate fear processing [15]. The speed and
accuracy of task completion, which in this instance was the recognition of facial
gender, under different emotional conditions can be used probe whether response
bias exists. This draws upon work suggesting that the threat of breathlessness may
absorb cognitive resources and affect the processing of new information via

attentional bias [16, 17]. Biased attentional processes, either towards or away from
potentially threatening situations, may be mirrored by activity patterns within threat
and fear brain networks.

Analysis
Cluster Analysis
When calculating the full correlation matrices for the hierarchical clustergrams,
scoring was reversed for the following measures: MSWT Distance, MSWT starting
oxygen saturation, MSWT heart rate change and spirometry. This ensured that
higher scores were associated with worse symptomatology across all measures.

Hierarchical cluster models reorder variables based on their correlation strengths so
that groups of related measures sit closer to each other than non-related measures.

This allows natural relationships to be easily visualised. The modeling process
formalises not only the relationship between pairs of variables, but also the manner
by which shared variance can be described as part of larger, related clusters. The
clustering algorithm initially considers pairs of variables in terms of their similarity or
“distance” (in arbitrary units). Linked pairs are then incorporated into larger clusters
with the goal of minimizing a cost function (distance to be bridged), a process that
can be thought of as minimizing the dissimilarity within clusters. As pairs become
clusters, a cluster tree or dendrogram is created. The distance between neighbouring
branches indicates the relative similarity of two measures, while advancing up the
hierarchical cluster tree moves further away in terms of link distance, and therefore
similarity.

Hierarchical models are useful as a descriptive tool for examining and visualising the
structure of the dataset as a whole. However, they do not provide information as to
the significance of any given cluster of behavioural measures. In contrast,
exploratory factor analysis (EFA), which falls under the umbrella of structural
equation modeling, can be used to formalise the relationships observed in the
hierarchical models. This allows the researcher to establish the presence of
underlying shared constructs via a number of fit statistics without applying a
preconceived structure on the result.

For the EFA analysis, the smallest number of uncorrelated clusters that maximally
explain the variance of the dataset was estimated. In this instance, parallel analysis
with oblique rotation was employed to calculate this value and the results were
visualised using a scree plot (Supplementary Figure 3). In a second step, the number
of variables to be retained within the model was determined. A maximum likelihood
estimation approach was applied, where variables that did not load significantly onto
a particular factor, or demonstrated significant cross loading (i.e. loaded onto more

than one factor) were excluded from further testing. Finally, the model statistics were
interrogated to formalize the shared variance across latent factors and the extent to
which each variable contributed to its factor as a whole. The smallest number of
factors that significantly explained the variance across the dataset was then
accepted as the model of best fit. Model selection criteria included loading variables
above 0.4 with no cross loading or freestanding variables, and significant X2/df ratio
with Tucker-Lewis Index (TL-index) close to 1 and RMSEA < 0.06. Models were fit
using Lavaan version 0.6-1 [22] in R version 3.2.1 (R Core Team).

Imaging Analysis
MRI Preprocessing
The data were corrected for movement using MCFLIRT (Motion correction using
FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool [23]). Non-brain structures were removed
using BET (Brain Extraction Tool [24]). Spatial smoothing was carried out using a
full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel of 5mm, while high-pass temporal filtering
(Gaussian-weighted least squares straight line fitting; 90 s) removed low frequency
noise and slow-drift.

Distortion correct of EPI data was carried out using a combination of FUGUE
(FMRIB’s Utility for Geometrically Unwarping EPI’s [25, 26] and BBR (Boundary
Based Registration; part of the FMR Expert Analysis Tool, FEAT version 6.0 [27]).

Data denoising was carried out as follows: Before the first level analysis, each
functional scan was decomposed into maximally independent components using
FMRIB’s MELODIC tool (Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimised Decomposition
into Independent Components). “Noise” components were identified by FIX (FMRIB’s
auto-classification tool, [28, 29]) using the WhII.Standard.RData [30] trained classifier
with aggressive clean up option. A Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was run on

the FIX identified components to retrain 99% of the variance. Separately, the cardiac
and respiratory related physiological signals (recorded via a pulse oximeter and a
respiratory bellows) were transformed into a series of regressors, (three cardiac and
four respiratory harmonics) as well as an interaction term and a measure of
respiratory volume per unit of time (RVT), using FSL’s physiological noise modeling
tool (PNM). The signal associated with these waveforms (modeled using
retrospective image correction (RETROICOR) [31, 32]) was then used to form
voxelwise noise regressors.

The confounds identified by FSL’s FIX and PNM tools, along with sources of noise
arising from motion, were then combined into a single model. This single noise model
approach builds upon the technique outlined by [33]; and fully detailed by [34]. In
these preceding works we employed a step-wise technique whereby physiological
noise (identified by PNM) and FIX-identified noise were each removed from the data
in separate steps prior to data entry into the lower level model. In the new cleanup
pipeline, a single text file containing time-course information relating to FIX identified
noise components along with white matter or CSF related noise was included as
additional confound EV’s within the lower level model, while the PNM-identified noise
was entered into the model as a standard voxel-wise confound list. In this updated
de-noising pipeline, confounds identified above are added to model at the stage of
first-level analysis and thus the functional dataset can be corrected for sources of
noise arising from motion, scanner and cerebro-spinal fluid artefacts, cardiac, and
respiratory noise in a single step, rather than three.

Image Registration
The functional scans were registered in a two-step process to the MNI152 (1x1x1
mm) standard space brain template. Firstly, each subject’s EPI was registered to
their associated T1-weighted structural image using BBR (6 DOF) with nonlinear field

map distortion correction [27]. In the second step the subject’s structural image was
registered to 1mm standard space via an affine transformation followed by nonlinear
registration (using FNIRT: FMRIB’s Non-linear Registration Tool [35]).

Statistical Thresholds
This study was originally powered to test for significance at z>2.3, p<0.05, prior to
the adoption of the now standard cluster correction threshold of z>3.1 or threshold
free cluster enhancement. Therefore, we have additionally provided a supplementary
demonstration (Supplementary Figure 6) of the significant activity at this reduced
threshold.

Results
The value of combining EFA with a hierarchical cluster model can be visualised by
comparing Supplementary Figure 2 with Figure 3. In Supplementary Figure 2 all
available behavioural measures have been included in a hierarchical cluster model.
As a result, while a colour gradient top-bottom (red to blue respectively) is roughly
visible, no clear structure can be seen in the dendrogram shown left of the figure. In
contrast, once the number of dimensions have been reduced, as shown in Figure 3,
clear groups can be observed in the dendrogram – shown left of the central
correlation matrix

Further characterization of the fMRI results can be found in supplementary Figure 5,
where the response to breathlessness-related words compared to non-words in all
participants (A), and in the high and low symptom load groups is shown. The contrast
of activity in response to breathlessness-related words compared to non-words
between the two behavioural clusters of participants is shown in Supplementary
Figure 6. Supplementary Figure 7 shows the activation for fearful and happy faces
across all participants (no significant difference between groups was found).

In a direct comparison of the two tasks across the groups of participants (high and
low symptom load), significant activity was observed within the anterior insula, middle
frontal gyrus and post-central gyrus in the low symptom load group to the
breathlessness-related fear cues (Supplement Figure 8). This difference did not
survive the correction with more rigorous thresholds now expected of neuroimaging
studies.
