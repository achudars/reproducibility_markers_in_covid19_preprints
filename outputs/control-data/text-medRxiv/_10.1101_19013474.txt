Abstract

34

Background

35

The Holuhraun volcanic eruption September 2014 to February 2015 emitted large amounts of sulfur

36

dioxide (SO2).

37

Objectives

38

The aim of this study was to determine the association between volcanic SO2 gases on general

39

population respiratory health in the Icelandic capital area some 250 km from the eruption site.

40

Methods

41

Respiratory health outcomes were: asthma medication dispensing (AMD) from the Icelandic Medicines

42

Register, medical doctor consultations in primary care (PCMD) and hospital emergency department

43

visits (HED) in Reykjavík (population: 215 000) for respiratory disease from 1 January 2010 to 31

44

December 2014. The associations between daily counts of health events,and daily mean

45

SO2 concentration and high SO2 levels (24-hour mean SO2>125µg/m3) were analyzed using

46

generalized additive models.

47

Results

48

After the eruption began, AMD was higher than before (129.4 vs. 158.4 individuals per day, p<0.05).

49

Increases in SO2 concentration were associated with an estimated increase in AMD by 1.05% (95% CI

50

0.48 - 1.62%) per 10 µg/m3 at lag 0-2, 1.51% (95% CI 0.63 – 2.40%) increase in individuals under 18

51

years of age. PCMD for respiratory causes increased by 1.52% (95% CI 1.04 -2.00%) per 10 µg/m3 SO2

52

at lag 0-2. For HED, only effect estimated for individuals aged 64 years and older were significantly

53

increased, by 1.541% (95% CI 0.02- 3.07%) per 10 µg/m3 SO2 at lag 0-2. Following days with

54

SO2 levels above 125 µg/m3, AMD and PCMD were increased in all age groups, in AMD mostly so in

55

individuals under 18 by 20.4%(95%CI 4.8 – 23.4%), and adult PCMD visits by 24.1%(95%CI 16.8 –

56

31.3%). HED was significantly increased in elderly by 26.3% (95%CI 5.56-47.0).

57

Discussion

58

High levels of volcanic SO2 are associated with increases in dispensing of AMD, and health care

59

utilization in primary and tertiary care. Individuals with prevalent respiratory disease may be

60

particularly susceptible.

Introduction

67

The Holuhraun volcanic eruption in the Barðarbunga central volcanic system in the fall and winter of

68

2014-2015 was the largest eruption in Iceland since the Laki eruption in 1783-1784. Some 12 million

69

tons of sulphur dioxide, SO2, was emitted from the eruption and the lava field,(Gíslason et al. 2015) and

70

was dispersed widely over Iceland according to meteorological conditions,(Ilyinskaya et al. 2017)

71

reaching the capital area, some 250 km from the eruption site where the 24-hour air quality guideline

72

limit for SO2, 125 µg/m3 (WHO 2007) was exceeded repeatedly during the fall of 2014.. A previous

73

study of professionals working at the eruption site with very high exposures experienced no serious

74

health effects after exposure, perhaps because they were wearing protective equipment such as

75

masks.(Carlsen et al., 2019). Meanwhile,population-level health effects remain to be investigated, in

76

particular in sensitive populations such as children and the elderly.

77

SO2 exposure at concentrations over 500 µg/m3 is associated with irritation of the respiratory tract in

78

susceptible individuals.(WHO 2007) At higher concentrations, SO2 exposure can trigger respiratory

79

symptoms such as acute bronchial asthma, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory distress – especially in

80

individuals with hyper-reactivity syndrome.(Nowak et al. 1997; WHO 2007, EPA 2008) Exposure to

81

SO2 from active volcanoes is associated with increased rates chronic cough and phlegm and dry and

82

sore throat.(Ishigami et al. 2008; Iwasawa et al. 2009, 2010; Kochi et al. 2017; Longo 2013; Longo et

83

al. 2010, 2008; Longo and Yang 2008) Fatalities from very high SO2-related exposure near volcanoes

84

have also been reported.(IVHHN.ORG) While some of the previous studies report dose-response

85

relationship between SO2 and respiratory symptoms, their study designs and methods leave most of

86

them prone to bias as symptoms were most often self-reported and participants were aware of their

87

exposure status.(Hansell and Oppenheimer 2004) Moreover, most of the existing literature pertains to

88

long-term area-wide exposure whereas SO2 exposure in Iceland during the Holuhraun eruption was

89

intermittent with few hours or days of high SO2 concentrations followed by periods of low SO2

90

concentrations when wind directions changed.(Ilyinskaya et al. 2017)

91

With population-based registers on medicine dispensing and health care utilization as well as vigorous

92

monitoring of air pollution in the capital area, Iceland provides an ideal setting for studying health

93

effects of exposure to SO2 from volcanic eruption. The objective of this study was therefore to study

94

the acute health effects of exposure to volcanic SO2 on respiratory health in the general population of

95

Iceland. We hypothesized that respiratory health care utilization due to respiratory system illness would

96

be increased in the general population following days with SO2 concentrations above the air quality

97

guideline value of 125µg/m3 per 24 hours. Furthermore, we investigated the associations of health

98

outcomes with continuous exposure, the lag-times of the effects and effects in age groups and

99

respiratory infections and obstructive respiratory disease.

Material and methods

101

The Holuhraun volcanic eruption in North-East central Iceland began 31 August 2014 and ended 27

102

February 2015. The study period was 1 January 2010 – 31 December 2014, and the time before the

103

eruption was used a reference period. The Holuhraun eruption persisted for until end of February 2015,

104

whereas our study period ends 31 December 2014 due to a change in the database recording of events.

105

However, SO2 never exceeded the air quality guideline limit during January and February 2015,

106

although daily mean concentrations were still higher than before the eruption.

107

The mean population of Iceland during the study period was 320 000 inhabitants. The capital area,

108

Reykjavík and surrounding municipalities, had 205 282 residents at the beginning of the study period,

109

and 215 965 residents at the end.(Statistics Iceland 2017) The analysis was restricted to the capital area

110

(residential postcodes 101-171, 200-225, and 270) where adequate information about SO2 exposure was

111

available for the whole study period. The Icelandic health care system is state-centred, mainly publicly

112

funded system with universal coverage. (Sigurgeirsdóttir et al. 2014) We obtained data on respiratory

113

health from 1) ) the National Medicines Register; 2) Primary care centres (that function as first point of

114

contact) and 3) Landspitali, the national university hospital, the country’s centre of clinical excellence

115

(Sigurgeirsdóttir et al. 2014). All three registers are held by the Icelandic Directorate of Health and

116

extraction is subject to approval from the Icelandic Bioethical Committee. From the National Medicines

117

Register we extracted data on dispensing (pharmacy sales to individuals) of prescription anti-asthma

118

medication (AMD) classified by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code R03.(WHO 2015b) This class

119

of drugs are prescribed for relieving symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

120

COPD, and in some cases to relieve breathing difficulties in individuals with respiratory infections.

121

Asthma medication dispensing is a proxy for respiratory health in a population and mild disease

122

episodes (Menichini and Mudu, 2010; Conti et al., 2015; Furu et al., 2010). The data were extracted

123

along with individual data on residence (postcode), age, sex and an anonymous personal identification

124

number. From the primary care centers (PCC) and hospital emergency department (HED) databases at

125

the Directorate of Health we extracted data on individuals diagnosed with respiratory illnesses

126

(International Classification of Disease, ICD code J (WHO 2015a)) along with data on residence

127

(postcode), age, sex, and an anonymous personal identification number. As the same bout of illness is

128

likely to result in recurring health care contacts we included only the first instance of an individual

129

registration within a 14-day period for the same diagnosis category to avoid exposure misclassification

130

with respect to the timing of the outcome. For primary care, we analysed the number of MD visits

131

(PCMD) in the main analysis (the total number of contacts including phone calls and consultations were

132

analysed in a sensitivity analysis). For HED, all visits were included regardless whether the individual

133

was admitted to hospital. For each outcome, we constructed daily time series starting 1 January 2010 to

134

31 December 2014 for the following age groups; children (under 18 years of age), adults (18-64 years),

135

and elderly (age 65 years and above).

136

We obtained SO2, PM10, and NO2, data along with meteorological data from the Icelandic Environment

137

Agency’s stationary air pollution monitor located in Reykjavík (Figure 1) for the study period and

138

constructed a time series of daily mean values.

139
140

Statistical methods

141

after the beginning of the eruption (using age at date of first occurrence in the data). A correlation matrix

142

of exposure variables can be found in the supplement. We use the t-tests to assess as whether there was

143

a statistically signficant difference in concentrations of relevant pollutant and the number of daily health

144

outcome evens before and during the eruption.

145

In the regression analysis of the daily number of contacts for all outcomes during the whole study

146

period, SO2 exposure was given as a) a continuous variable, or b) an indicator value of the 24-hour SO2

147

concentration exceeding the air quality guideline value (125 µg/m3).(WHO 2007)

148

We fitted to the data distributed lag non-linear models (DNLM).(Gasparrini et al. 2010) to identify the

149

delay in days (lag days) from exposure to the observed health outcomes (Supplemental figure S1 and

150

S2). We estimated the effects of SO2 exposure on the outcome by fitting generalized additive models

151

(GAM), (Peng and Dominici, 2008)

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all exposure and outcome variables for the period before and

152

Yt ~ Quasipoisson (µt)

153

log µt = α + β1SO2t + β2PM10 + β3NO2 + β4Temperature + β5RelativeHumidity + β6Idow+ β7Strike

154

+ s1(day of the year, bs=”cc”) + s2(day in the time series, 4)

155
156

Where Yt denotes the daily number of health events, β1 denotes the log relative rate of events associated

157

with a 10 µg/m3 increase in SO2. The terms s1(day of the year, bs=”cc”) and s2(day in the time series,

158

4), are smoothing functions (smoothing splines) of season and calendar time designed to control for

159

seasonal trends and trends during the whole study period, Idow is an indicator for day of week and Strike

160

is an indicator of strike days (used only in HED and PCC data)

161

The main exposure variable is moving three-day averages (lag 0-2) of SO2.We adjusted for seasonality

162

using cubic cyclical basis, based on day of each year. We adjusted for overall time trend using

163

smoothing spline across the entire study period with four degrees of freedom.(Bhaskaran et al. 2013)

164

In addition, we added a factor variables to adjust for day-of week and odd holidays. For PCC and HED

165

visits an indicator factor variable was created to adjust for days where medical doctors (MD’s) were on

166

strike as some “strike days” were also high SO2 days. Several methods of addressing this issue; no

167

adjustment, excluding strike days, or adjusting for the indicator were tested.

168

The results are adjusted for co-pollutants and weather (PM10, NO2, temperature, and relative humidity)

169

at the same lag intervals as the main exposure. Results from unadjusted models are found in the

170

supplement.

171

Quasipoisson distribution was assumed for all outcomes. As certain diagnoses categories may be of

172

interest, we also present results for PCMDand HED visits stratified by subcategory into infectious

173

respiratory disease categories for a) infectious diseases including acute upper respiratory infections (

174

ICD codes J00-J06); influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), and other acute lower respiratory infections

175

(J20-J22), and b) obstructive respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

176

COPD, and asthma ( J44 and 45).

177

Sensitivity analysis

178

We performed sensitivity analyses on all primary contacts including phone calls, consultations, and

179

“other”, as actual PCMD visits are subject to availability. We also repeated the main analysis including

180

recurring contacts for the same diagnoses within 14 days to estimate the true impact on the health care

181

systems from increased population morbidity. For HED visits, we performed a sensitivity analysis

182

including only individuals who were admitted for in-patient care. With regards to regular asthma

183

medication users, official advice was broadcast to the public on days with high SO2 to ensure that

184

individuals with respiratory diseases would have sufficient medicine at hand. In order to evaluate

185

whether the observed results were merely due to compliance, we performed a sensitivity analysis

186

excluding a) the first day, and b) the first week, in a series of days with high SO2 concentrations.

187

Additionally, we performed sensitivity analysis on different lags of the HED data as our exploratory

188

analysis revealed age-specific effects at different lags (Figure S1). To eliminate any confounding effect

189

of other volcanic eruptions ((Eyjafjallajökull 2010 and Grímsvötn 2011) that impacted air quality during

190

the study period,(Gudmundsson et al. 2012; Thorsteinsson et al. 2012) we repeated the main analyses

191

for AMD, PCMD and HED excluding the years 2010 and 2011. Also, we performed analyses allowing

192

for non-linearity of both lag structure, and concentration of SO2 and present those results in the

193

supplement (Figure S1 and Figure S2) and investigated lag-responses of sub-categories of respiratory

194

disease (Figure S3). We used an autoregressive term (adjusting for the outcome at lag 1) to improve the

195

autocorrelation of the model residuals (Brumback et al., 2000). All analysis was performed in R using

196

the packages “mgcv”(Wood 2018) and “dlnm”.(Gasparrini et al. 2018)

Holuhraun population study

November 2019

197

Results

198

The daily mean SO2 concentrations in Iceland’s capital area were low or moderate, until the Holuhraun

199

eruption began 30 August 2014 (Table 1, Figure 2, Figure S5). After the eruption began, SO2

200

concentrations surpassed the air quality guideline limit (125 µg/m3) on ten days, and both mean and

201

median concentrations were significantly higher than before the eruption began.

202

Before the eruption, an average of 129.4 individuals per day were registered purchasing (=were

203

dispensed) AMD. The individuals, were mostly female (56.3%) and the mean age was 35.7 (SD 22.9)

204

years. After the eruption began, there were an average of 158.4 individuals per day. The mean age was

205

44.5 (SD 26.3) years. Before the eruption, 106 528 individuals, attended primary care s for respiratory

206

disease, the mean age was 32.8 (SD 22.5) years and 60.9% were women. After the eruption began, 15

207

806 individuals attended primary care for respiratory diseaseand the mean age was 35.0 years (SD 26.6),

208

60.4% were women. The most common form of contact was GP visits (61%) and phone calls (33%)

209

(See flowchart in supplement for detail of the selection process). In HED, 19 541 individuals were

210

registered seeking care for respiratory health outcomes before the eruption . The mean age was 36.3

211

years (SD 29.4) and 49.8% were women. After the eruption began, there were 1 932 individuals visited

212

HED with a mean age of 39.4 years (SD 30.5) and 51.8% women (Table 1, Figure 2).

213

After the eruption began, SO2 was significantly higher than before; 35.7 µg/m3 (SD 71.2) vs 1.4 µg/m3

214

(SD 1.1. The daily number of number of individuals with AMD was significantly increased compared

215

with the reference period (129.4 vs 158.4, p<0.001). Neither total nor age categories of HED and PCMD

216

MD visits were significantly higher or lower during the eruption period as a whole compared to the

217

period before (Table 2, Figure 2).

218

Regression analysis results

219

In the adjusted regression analyses of the whole study period 2010-2014 we found that after adjusting

220

for other pollutants and weather, exposure to SO2 at short lags (lag 0-2, figure S2) was associated with

221

an estimated increase in the number of AMDs to individuals of all ages by 1.05% (95% CI 0.48 –

222

1.62%) per 10 µg/m3 SO2. For children 0-17 years of age, the estimate was higher, 1.51% (95% CI 0.63

223

– 2.40%) and for individuals 65 years and older, the estimate was lower, 0.77% (95% CI 0.05 – 1.51).

224

SO2 concentrations exceeding the air quality guideline of 125µg/m3, were associated with a statistically

225

significant increase in dispensing of AMD at lag 0–2 by 13.5% (95% CI 5.3- 21.7%), the increase was

226

20.4% (95% CI 8.0-32.9%) in individuals under 18 years of age (Table 3). In the age-stratified analysis,

227

the association effect estimates were highest in children under 18 by 20.4% (95% CI 8.0 - 32.9%) and

228

with a lower estimate for elderly, 8.8% (95%CI -1.9 – 19.5%) which did not reach statistical

229

significance.

230

For PCMD and HED, including an indicator variable for days where MDs were on strike improved the

231

model fit and was an effect modifier which increased the effect estimates, so this variable was added to

the PCMD and HED models. PCMD visits increased by 1.52% (95% CI 1.04 – 2.00%) per 10 µg/m3

233

SO2 at lag 0–2 for all ages, and stratifying by age, the increase was highest in adults.

234

For PCMD, short term exposure to SO2 over the air quality guideline value was associated with

235

increases by 21.6% (95% CI 15.1 – 28.6%). The increase was highest in adults by 24.1% (95% CI 16.8

236

– 31.3%).

237
238

For HED visits, SO2 exposure was associated with increased risk for individuals older than 64 at lag 0–

239

2 (Figure S1) by 1.54% (95% CI 0.02 – 3.07%) per 10 µg/m3 (Table 3). For exposure over the air quality

240

guideline limit, the effect estimate significantly increased only in elderly by 26.3% (95% CI 5.56 –

241

47.0%).

242

Stratifying by diagnosis category, SO2 exposure was associated with increased PCMD visits for

243

respiratory infections at lag 0–2 by 1.35% (95% CI 0.80 – 1.89%) per 10 µg/m3. PCC contacts for

244

obstructive disease were increased by 2.48% (95% CI 1.57 – 3.39%). Following air quality guideline

245

value exceedances, the estimated increase in PCC MD visits were 19.0 (95% CI 10.5 – 28.1%) and

246

34.3% (95% CI 18.5 – 52.2%) for respiratory infections and obstructive disease, respectively. For HED

247

visits, SO2 exposure was not associated with significant increases in visits due to respiratory infections

248

or asthma or COPD although all estimates were positive (Table 4).

249

In the sensitivity analysis, the unadjusted associations between SO2 exposure and health outcomes was

only marginally different (<10 percentage point change) from the adjusted results (Table S1) with the

251

exception of the estimates for HED visits which decreased from 1.12% (95% CI 0.19 – 11.2%) to 0.84%

252

(95% CI -0.08-1.76%). However, the estimated association with HED visits in elderly increased from

253

1.54% (95% CI 0.02 – 3.70%) in the adjusted analysis to 1.70% (0.26 -3.16%) in the unadjusted

increased from 1.36 (95% CI 0.44 - 2.28%) per 10 µg/m3 SO2 in the main analysis (Table 3) to 1.44%

259

(95% CI 0.69 – 2.19%) (Table S2). Not excluding the recurring contacts (individuals with two or more

260

PCC contacts within 14 days), the age distribution had shifted further, so the estimated increase in

261

events in elderly reached 1.56% (95% CI 0.85 – 2.28%) per 10 µg/m3. The estimated effects of exposure

262

to SO2 concentrations above the air quality guidelines on AMD and PCMD followed a similar pattern

263

to that of continuous exposure where adults had the highest effect estimated. In the analysis of HED

264

10 µg/m3 SO2 (Table S2) and 175.2% (95% CI 20.9-526.2%) after SO2 levels over the air quality

267

guideline limit. In this analysis, there were no significant associations between SO2 and HED at lag 0-

268

2.

269

In sensitivity analysis to investigate the importance of compliance on the observed associations with

270

AMD and PCC, we removed the first day in a series of days with high SO2 concentrations (Table S3).

271

The estimated effect of SO2 exposure on AMD and PCC outcomes was higher for children than in the

272

main analysis, but lower in adults compared to the main analysis. Excluding the whole week after the

273

first high SO2 concentrations in the capital area, effect estimates for both AMD and PCC were higher

274

in elderly and adults compared to the main analysis. Considering effects on HED of SO2 exposure at

275

lag 2-4 altered the age-distribution of the results, so that there HED in children were increased by 2.09%

276

(95% CI 0.51-3.70%)

277

Excluding the years 2010 and 2011 where ash-rich volcanic eruptions occurred yielded generally

278

similar, albeit slightly attenuated estimates which in few cases failed to reach statistical significance.

279

Also, the association between HED and SO2 at lag 2-4 were calculated (Table S3).

280

Discussion

281

In this study, a comparison of health care utilisation in Iceland’s capital are before and after the eruption

282

began showed that only AMD increased significantly during the Holuhraun eruption, but primary care

283

and hospital care was not higher during the eruption than before. However, in adjusted time series

284

regression analysis, SO2 concentrations were associated with increased AMD, MD visits in primary

285

care for respiratory causes and hospital emergency department visitsat lag 0-2. Using a cut-off or

286

continuous measure of SO2 resulted in largely similar estimates (Table 3). The effect estimates for

287

specific disease categories indicate that individuals with obstructive lung disease were particularly

288

affected (Table 4).

289

In the regression, our choice of lags were informed - exploratory analysis (Figures S1). For AMD and

290

PCC visits the observed increase occurred during the same day and up to two days after a peak in SO2

291

concentration. HED visits increased one to three days after a peak in SO2 which could indicate that

292

primary care is the first point of contact for a majority of individuals and hospital care is sought only

293

after other care options have been exhausted. In the compliance analysis, the effect of initial warnings

294

of volcanic gas exposure appeared to be limited, as excluding the first day or week of high SO2 yielded

295

similar estimates for AMD and PCC visits, although there was some loss of statistical power. This

296

indicates that the increase reflected actual increased respiratory morbidities rather than only compliance

297

as it persisted after first exposure (Supplemental Table S2). We present both unadjusted results (Table

298

S1) and results adjusted for other air pollutants (Tables 3 and 4) as well as plotted an exposure-response

299

function with a spline. Comparing the results from the continuous analysis and the cut-off analysis, we

300

found little indication of significant non-linear effects, which is also observed in the spline plot of the

exposure-response function (Figure S2). Our results are mostly consistent with those from previous

302

studies of SO2 exposure in urban settings; e.g. respiratory mortality rates were estimated to increase by

303

2.4% per 27 µg/m3 SO2 (Li et al. 2017), corresponding to a point estimate of 0.88% per 10 µg/m3 SO2,

304

which is lower than the estimates for HED and PCMD estimate of respiratory morbidity associated with

305

SO2 found in this study; 1.12% (95% CI 0.19-2.05%) and 1.52% (95% CI 1.04 – 2.00%) per 10 µg/m3

306

SO2, respectively. In previous studies of SO2 exposure during volcanic eruptions, the SO2 concentration

307

on Miyakejima Island increased after Mount Oyama erupted in 2000. After evacuating the island at the

308

time of the eruption, residents and aid workers returned from 2005 and onwards. Aid volunteers (n=611)

309

reported respiratory irritation and the rates were associated with SO2 exposure - particularly among

310

women and non-smokers.(Ishigami et al. 2008) During the same eruption, children, who were exposed

311

to daily mean concentration of 125 µg/m3 SO2, had increased rates of wheezing.(Iwasawa et al. 2010)

312

In a follow-up study 2006-2011, permanent residents of Miyakejima Island (n=168) who lived in areas

313

with SO2 reported increased rates of cough and wheeze few effects.(Kochi et al. 2017) None of the

314

studies of people exposed at Miyakejima Island found adverse effects on lung function.(Ishigami et al.

315

2008; Iwasawa et al. 2009, 2010; Kochi et al. 2017) The Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii has been erupting

316

continuously since 1983 with periods of increased eruption activity from 2008. SO2 concentrations

317

spiked from a daily mean concentration of 72 µg/m3 to 215 µg/m3 in a populated area downwind during

318

this period and the rates of cough, and acute pharyngitis diagnosed at a clinic in the exposed community

319

increased subsequently.(Longo et al. 2010) A cross sectional study found that those living in areas

320

exposed to SO2 had increased risk of cough, phlegm, and hay fever. A qualitative survey of subjects

321

from the same study population revealed that participants reported that symptoms disappeared 7-10

322

days after leaving the exposed area, but reappeared one week after returning.(Longo et al. 2008) In a

323

study of individuals exposed at the Holuhraun eruption site we found that while some reported

324

respiratory symptoms during their stay at the eruption site, most symptoms had resolved and lung

325

function was normal at a clinical examination one to six days later.(Carlsen et al. 2019) Regarding

326

individual susceptibility, we observed the highest effect estimates for PCMD visits for asthma and

327

COPD (Table 4). The effect estimate for HED visits were also increased but did not reach statistical

328

significance. In controlled trials, hyper-responsiveness to SO2 has previously been reported as common

329

(20-25%) in individuals with positive asthma test (methacoline test).(Nowak et al. 1997), indicating

330

that they be particularly vulnerable to severe SO2 exposure. Similarly, respiratory infections were

331

increased in PCMD visits and tended to be increased for HED visits, although the increase did not reach

332

statistical significance. Finally, an association between SO2 and hospital visits for upper respiratory

333

tract infections has previously been reported(Li et al. 2017).

334

Previous studies of health effects of air pollution in Iceland have yielded lower effect estimates of daily

335

air pollution on morbidity than the current study,(Carlsen et al. 2012b) other air pollution exposure

336

types are thus not likely to bias the results. This includes H2S, which has a low correlation (<0.1) with

337

the exposure of interest during the study period (data not shown). During the reference period, there

338

were two ash-rich volcanic eruptions, in Eyjafjallajökull 2010 and Grímsvötn 2011. While ash from

339

Eyjafjallajökull had local respiratory health effects(Carlsen et al. 2012a) and there may have been

340

adverse health effects in the capital area,(Carlsen et al. 2015) neither eruption had significant SO2

341

emissions and sensitivity analysis excluding this period yielded similar results (Supplemental Table

342

S2). Our study employs a time series design were individual level risk factors are not time-dependent

343

and thus should not confound the association between short term exposure to air SO2 and health

344

outcomes, leaving bias due to unmeasured confounders, seasonal variation, and other intermittent

345

exposures as main concerns. The exposed period October and November of 2014 did not coincide with

346

any viral respiratory illnesses (e.g. influenza and RS-virus) epidemic,(Tilkynningarskyldir sjúkdómar

347

2018) but it did coincide with the MD labour conflict which resulted in lower PCC and HED attendance

348

during those days, Hence, results from the analysis comparing the eruption period with the time before

349

may have underestimated of true effect of the SO2 from the eruption.

350

SO2, PM10 and NO2 data was missing for a number of days which were excluded from the analysis. As

351

the volcanic plume effectively changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere during the eruption

352

period (Supplemental Tables S4a-b), the correlations of SO2 with other air pollutants were altered after

353

the eruption (we present unadjusted results in the supplement (Supplemental Table S1)). The results

354

from these are nearly identical to the main analysis (Table 3), indicating that the effect of the very high

355

concentrations of SO2 was unambiguous.

356

It is a strength of the current study that health data were collected prospectively from population-wide

357

registers, which minimizes the risk of information bias from individuals knowing their exposure status.

358

Although the exposure would have been known to the public for at least part of the exposed period but

359

we attempt to addresse this source of bias in the sensitivity analysis, showing only moderate changes to

360

the results (Table S3). As a study outcome, we use dispensing of asthma-medication, a novel and more

361

sensitive proxy than primary care attendance and hospital visits. It measures morbidity in individuals

362

who in most cases already are in contact with the health care system. However, this outcome has been

363

used in other studies and is known to be a proxy for asthma morbidity in a population (Furu et al,. 2010;

364

Naureckas et al., 2005) and be associated with air pollution (Menichini and Mudu, 2010; Fattore et al.,

365

2016) A limitation with register-data is that it is not collected for research purposes and diagnoses given

366

in the health care system could be biased towards overestimation as medical professionals assume

367

respiratory outcomes to be more likely during the eruption. However, as the estimated effect are similar

368

across all respiratory outcomes we conclude that this sources of bias is not likely to fully explain our

369

findings.. By basing exposure status on residential postcode we assume that people spend most of their

370

time at home, however, outcomes in individuals not in the exposed area during the study period would

371

bias the results toward the null. Reykjavík and the Icelandic capital area was exposed to SO2

372

concentrations above 125µg/m3 during a total of ten days which occurred mostly during October and

November 2014. This limits the statistical power of the study and our options for further analysis, as

374

does the fact that our study period did not extend until after the eruption, meaning that we cannot fully

375

assess the importance of population increase during the study period on our results.

376

In conclusion, this comprehensive study with prospectively collected data on volcanic air pollution

377

exposure and respiratory outcome, is the first to firmly establish an association between spikes of high

378

SO2 concentrations and respiratory outcomes in the general population, particularly in individuals with

379

prevalent respiratory disease. These findings emphasise the need for attention from authorities and

380

parents to the health susceptible individuals during times of volcanic eruptions.
