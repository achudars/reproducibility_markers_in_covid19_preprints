ABSTRACT

Background:
Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have more gait variability under dual-task
conditions than cognitively healthy adults. However, characteristics associated with this
susceptibility of gait to dual-task stress are unknown.

Methods:
Testing was performed at baseline in the Study of Mental And Resistance Training (SMART).
Ninety-three adults with MCI (age 70±6.8 years; 66.6% female) performed a single- and dualtask walk (cognitive distractor=letter fluency), in random order. Linear and non-linear gait
variability were measured using force-sensitive insoles. Cognitive performance during dualtasking was assessed by the number of correct words vocalized. Cognitive function, brain
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), muscle strength, aerobic capacity, body composition,
physical and psychosocial function were also assessed as potential correlates of gait dynamics.

Results:
Gait dynamics worsened during dual-tasking, with decrements in both stride time variability
(p<0.001) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) (p=0.001). Lower aerobic capacity and
thinner posterior cingulate cortex were associated with greater decrements in DFA (p<0.05).
Smaller hippocampal volume, worse psychological well-being and poorer static balance were
associated with greater decrements in stride time variability (p<0.05). By contrast, cognitive
performance did not change under dual-task conditions compared to seated testing (p=0.13).

Conclusions:
Under dual-task conditions, participants with MCI preserved their cognitive performance at the
expense of gait stability. Decrements in dual-tasking gait were associated with lower aerobic
fitness, balance, psychological well-being, and brain volume in cognitively-relevant areas of the
posterior cingulate and hippocampus, all potentially modifiable characteristics. Trials of targeted
interventions are needed to determine the potential plasticity of gait variability in high-risk
cohorts.
Key words: Dual-task, Gait variability, MCI, stride variability, detrended fluctuation analysis.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of gait abnormalities increases with age, affecting up to 35% of communitydwelling older adults1. Gait abnormalities are characterized by a more variable gait pattern,
leaving affected individuals with an increased risk of falls2 and reduced mobility3. Adults with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage between normal cognition and
dementia, are more likely to have greater gait variability4 and consequently, double the risk of
injurious and multiple falls compared to cognitively normal adults5.

Dual-tasking is a sensitive method used to investigate interactions between gait variability and
cognitive function6, with worse gait performance under dual-task conditions associated with an
increased fall risk amongst older adults78. Dual-tasking impairs gait in individuals with deficits in
cognitive function, including MCI and Alzheimer’s disease9. However, studies evaluating dualtask associations between cognition and gait variability in older adults with MCI are limited.
Furthermore, imaging studies of brain regions and their associations with gait variability have
mainly focussed on single-task gait variability, or the effects of dual-tasking on gait speed10-12
rather than more comprehensive assessments of gait variability or cognitive performance under
dual-task stress. Finally, identification of modifiable characteristics associated with gait
dynamics under dual-task conditions could lead to targeted interventions to improve gait
dynamics and ultimately reduce falls in older adults with MCI and other vulnerable cohorts.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of dual-tasking on gait
dynamics and cognitive performance in older adults with MCI, as well as to identify relevant
physical, psychosocial, and structural brain characteristics associated with decrements during

dual-tasking (dual-task cost). We hypothesized that there would be a worsening of both gait and
the performance of the secondary cognitive task during the dual-task condition, and that these
reductions would be associated with lower strength, aerobic capacity, functional performance,
psychosocial function and smaller hippocampal volume and posterior cingulate cortex thickness.
These factors were selected a priori due to their known decrements in individuals with cognitive
impairment, frailty, or elevated falls risk13.

METHODS
The complete study protocol for the Study of Mental and Resistance Training (SMART) has
been published14, with primary15 and secondary outcomes published16,17. The study was
approved by the Royal Prince Alfred Human Research Ethics Committee (X08-0064) on 24th of
April, 2008, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was
prospectively registered

with

the Australia

New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry

(ACTRN12608000489392). A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the SMART trial
was used for this investigation.

Participants
One hundred community-dwelling older adults with MCI (Peterson criteria18) were recruited.
Two participants could not wear gait monitors due to fused toes, while technical issues including
incomplete data recording, precluded full gait data in five others. Thus, gait dynamics data were
available for 93 participants. All participants were assessed at The University of Sydney, New
South Wales, Australia.

Assessment of cognitive function
The primary outcome of the SMART trial was global cognition assessed using the Alzheimer’s
Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog). Global, executive, and memory cognitive
domains were also calculated for the 93 participants with available gait variability data.
Additional details can be found in the Supplementary methods.

Assessment of letter fluency at rest
Letter fluency, a subcategory of verbal fluency, was assessed using the COWAT19 to measure
cognitive performance at rest. All participants were tested in a private room with a single
research assistant, in a resting, non-fasting state at a similar mid-morning time. Participants were
instructed to verbalize as many words as possible beginning with the letter “F” in 1 minute
(FSINGLE), excluding proper nouns, repeated words, and variations of the same word using a
prefix or suffix (e.g., foam and foaming). A score was calculated by totaling the number of
admissible words written down by the research assistant.

Assessment of gait dynamics
Gait dynamics were assessed similarly to methods previously described20,21. Briefly, forcesensitive insoles were placed in the participants’ shoes to measure the force applied to the ground
during a 2-minute period of ambulation at habitual pace using any assistive devices needed.
Participants were instructed to wear low-heeled shoes, comfortable clothing and visual and
hearing aids if required.

Gait assessment was performed under two conditions, ‘single-task’ (undistracted walking) and
‘dual-task’ (distracted walking), in a randomized order. Participants were not provided with any
instruction regarding task priority (i.e, cognitive or gait performance), and were told to perform
as well as possible for both tasks. Stride time variability (coefficient of variation, CV) and
detrended fluctuation analyses fractal scaling exponent (DFA22,23 were calculated for both singletask [(CVSINGLE) and (DFASINGLE)] and dual-task [(CVDUAL) and (DFADUAL)] conditions. To
assess stride-to-stride variability and arrhythmicity of gait, the coefficient of variation (CV) in
each participant’s stride time was calculated using the formula CV = (Standard Deviation /
Mean) * 100, with lower CV indicating more stable gait. To quantify how the dynamics of stride
times fluctuate and change over time, we applied detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to each
participant’s sequence of stride times. In general, physiologically healthy systems have fractal
scaling indices between 0.8 and 1.0, with lower values (closer to 0.5) indicating a less healthy
state24.

The secondary (cognitive distractor) task was the COWAT test, with the number of correct “F
words” counted in the first minute of walking (FDUAL). The letter “F” was selected to remain
consistent with the seated COWAT test described above (FSINGLE). The words were recorded
using a portable recorder (Samsung YP-U3, Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea) and the
recording was subsequently reviewed by the research assistant who counted the number of
admissible words during the first and second minute. The number of correct words in the first
minute only of the dual-task gait condition (FDUAL) was compared to the number of correct words
during the FSINGLE condition. The order was not randomized for the assessment of “F” words,
with the dual-task condition performed 1 week after the seated COWAT. The ‘dual-task cost’ for

CV, DFA and F words were calculated (CVCOST= CVDUAL – CVSINGLE; DFACOST= DFADUAL –
DFASINGLE; FCOST = FDUAL – FSINGLE).

Assessment of Neuroimaging Outcomes
Details of the neuroimaging assessment outcomes have been published14,17. Briefly, MRI data
were acquired on a 3.0-Tesla Philips Achieva System (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Brain
structure was assessed using a T1-weighted whole-brain scan with isotropic voxel 1 mm3
(sequence: T1TFE; TR/TE: 6.39/2.9 ms; slice thickness 1.0 mm without gap; in-plane resolution
1 × 1 mm). Left, right hippocampal volume was manually traced, using ANALYZE (version 10,
Mayo Clinic) following the published protocol25. For cortical thickness measurement, FreeSurfer
(v5.1.0, http://freesurfer.net) was applied to calculate the cortical thickness at whole brain level.
Then, the posterior cingulate mean cortical thickness was generated using the standard
FreeSurfer parcellation (Desikan-Killiany Atlas)26.

Assessment of peak strength
Maximal strength testing was assessed via the one-repetition maximum (1RM) on Keiser
pneumatic resistance machines (Keiser Sports Health Equipment, Ltd., Fresno, CA, USA).
Participants’ 1RMs were determined on the leg press, knee extension, hip abduction, chest press
and seated row machines. One RM tests were performed twice, one week apart, with the best
performance used.

Assessment of peak aerobic capacity

Aerobic capacity (VO2peak) was determined via indirect calorimetry during a physicianadministered, graded treadmill walking test to volitional fatigue. Methods and data handling have
been previously published16.

Measures of physical function
Details of the physical function assessments have been published14. Static balance was assessed
on one attempt using six different positions (wide stance, narrow stance, semi-tandem stance,
tandem stance, one leg with eyes open and one leg with eyes closed). Dynamic balance was
assessed using the time taken to forward tandem walk over a 3-meter marked course. Habitual
and maximal gait velocities were assessed over two metres using an Ultra-timer (Raymar,
Oxfordshire, UK). Lower extremity function and power was assessed using time to complete 5
sit-to-stands and stair climb power. Stair climb power was calculated using the following
formula P (watts) = (M × D) × 9.8/t Where: M = Body mass (kg), D= Vertical distance (m), D =
vertical height of the staircase, and t = Time (s). The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was assessed
twice, at least one week apart, with the furthest distance walked used. Further detail regarding
these assessments can be found in the Supplementary methods.

Anthropometry and Body Composition
Height, naked body mass and waist circumference were measured as the mean of triplicate
measures after a 12-hour overnight fast. Waist circumference was measured with Lufkin steel
tape measure (W606 PM, Apex Tool Australia Pty Ltd, Albury, NSW, AU), using the
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) protocol. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA; RJL
Systems, Inc., Clinton, MI, USA) was used to evaluate body composition. Whole body skeletal

muscle mass (kg) and fat free mass (kg) were calculated using the average resistance and
reactance values of three sequential BIA measures. Further details of the assessments are
published14.

Measures of Psychosocial Function
Psychosocial function and wellbeing were measured via the Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS), Scale
of Psychological Well Being (SPWB), Quality of Life Scale (QOLS), Physical and Mental
Health Short-36 (SF-36), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), Memory Awareness
Rating Scale – Memory Functioning Scale (MARS-MF), Duke Social Support Index Scale
(DSSIS) and Life Experience Questionnaire (LEQ). Further detail regarding these assessments
has been published14

Statistical Methods
Data were inspected for normality. Normally-distributed data are presented as mean±SD and
non-normally distributed data presented as median (interquartile range). All CV (CVSINGLE,
CVDUAL and CVCOST) variables were log-transformed prior to use in parametric statistics.
Sequential linear regression models (adjusted for age and sex) were constructed including
potential confounders associated with the number of F words during the COWAT test (FSINGLE)
and single- and dual-task gait dynamics (CVSINGLE and DFASINGLE). Next, linear mixed models
with repeated measures were constructed to determine the effect of dual-tasking on both letter
fluency and gait dynamics. The single-task condition (FSINGLE, CVSINGLE and DFASINGLE) was
entered as time point 1, and the ‘dual-task’ condition (FDUAL, CVDUAL and DFADUAL) as time
point 2. A compound symmetry covariance matrix was used. Models were adjusted for age and

sex, with gait dynamics outcomes further adjusted for the order of the walking condition. Next,
linear regression models were constructed to determine variables associated with FCOST, CVCOST
and DFACOST. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and baseline score of the dependent variable
and order of the condition for the gait dynamics assessment. All models involving cognitive
performance (including FSINGLE and FCOST) were further adjusted for education, while models
involving hippocampal volume and posterior cingulate cortex thickness were adjusted further
adjusted for total intracranial volume. Models involving DFA were also adjusted for the number
of medications, as justified below. Statistical significance was assumed at α<0.05. All data were
analysed using IBM SPSS (version 24; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

RESULTS
Baseline clinical characteristics of the participants have been published15. Data for the available
93 participants (66.6% women), were similar to the overall cohort (p>0.05 for all variables). The
average age was 70.0±6.8 years, MMSE score 27.5±1.4, and habitual gait speed 1.21±0.24 m/s,
with 17% of participants having a gait speed below 1.0 m/s. Participant characteristics data are
presented in Table 1.

Factors associated with single task gait dynamics
The number of medications prescribed was inversely associated with DFASINGLE (r=-0.23,
p=0.029), but not CVSINGLE (r=-0.03, p=0.75). There were no associations between age, sex,
years of education, smoking status, drinking status or the number of chronic diseases and either
index of gait dynamics. Consequently, all analyses with DFACOST as a dependent variable were
adjusted for the number of medications.

Dual-Task Cost
Data are presented in Figure 1. As hypothesized, gait dynamics worsened significantly during
dual-tasking, with decrements in performance observed for stride time variability [single-task
2.012 (0.767), dual-task 2.555 (2.227); p<0.0001 and DFA (single-task 0.804±0.151, dual-task
0.745±0.160; p=001). However, contrary to our hypothesis, cognitive performance on the
COWAT did not significantly change under dual-task conditions (single-task 13±5 words, dualtask 12±4 words, p=0.13; Figure 1). Changes in letter fluency (FCOST) were not associated with
changes in gait dynamics for either CVCOST (r=-0.14, p=0.171) or DFACOST (r=0.03, p=0.746).

Factors associated with changes in stride time variability component of gait during dual-tasking
(CVCOST)
For simplicity, significant associations are presented in Table 2. A complete set of results can be
seen in the Supplemental material. Contrary to our hypotheses, cognitive performance (executive
function, memory, attention and global domains) was not associated with CVCOST under dualtask conditions (p>0.05). However, higher (worse) CVCOST was associated with smaller left
hippocampus volume (r=-0.35, p=0.023) with a similar trend for total hippocampus volume (r=0.31, p=0.050). Gait dynamics and brain morphology data are presented in Figure 2.

Worse dynamic balance (longer tandem walk time) was directly associated with a higher CVCOST
(r=0.28, p=0.022). However, CVCOST was not associated with body composition, aerobic
capacity, strength or other measures of functional performance.

As hypothesized, psychological well-being was inversely associated with CVCOST, with higher
(better) Environmental Mastery, Personal Growth, Personal Relations, Purpose in Life, Selfacceptance and total score on the Psychological Wellbeing Scale associated with preservation of
gait under dual-task conditions (p<0.05). Similarly, CVCOST was inversely associated with Duke
Social Support Index Scale (DSSIS), indicating that the lower level of, and satisfaction with,
social support was associated with a greater gait impairment during dual-task conditions
(p<0.05).

Factors associated with changes in fractal scaling exponent of gait during dual-tasking
(DFACOST)
For simplicity, significant associations are presented in Table 2. A complete set of results can be
seen in the Supplemental material. Contrary to our hypotheses, cognition and psychosocial
function were not associated with DFACOST under dual-task conditions (p>0.05). Notably, as
anticipated, greater left (r=0.23, p=0.026) and total (r=0.25, p=0.015) posterior cingulate cortex
thickness as well as better performances in the 6MWT (r=0.25, p=0.025) and aerobic capacity
(r=0.24, p=0.033) were related to preservation of gait during dual-tasking. However, DFACOST
was unrelated to lower body strength (r=0.25, p=0.063), whole body strength (r=0.25, p=0.079),
static balance time (r=0.18, p=0.075) or tandem walk score (r=-0.12, p=0.254).

DISCUSSION
The primary finding from this novel investigation was that in older adults with MCI, resting
cognitive performance on a letter fluency task was preserved under dual-task conditions,
whereas a significant worsening of gait dynamics, both in the magnitude (CV) and time course

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19005249; this version posted August 23, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

(DFA), was observed. This finding in adults with MCI is consistent with the concept of “posture
second” that has previously been observed in healthy older adults27 and adults with Parkinson’s
disease28. In adults with MCI who have a reduced cognitive reserve compared to cognitively
healthy adults, the preservation of cognitive function at the expense of a stable gait may partially
explain why people with MCI are at a greater risk of falling than healthy peers5. Furthermore,
worsening of DFA was associated with lower posterior cingulate cortex thickness and aerobic
and walking capacity, while worsening of stride time variability was associated with smaller
hippocampal volume, static balance and psychological well-being. In contrast, single-task
(seated) cognitive function predicted neither gait variability nor gait dynamic changes during
dual-tasking. Although previous studies4 have focused on the decrements in gait under dual-task
conditions, our study has also investigated for the first time the effects of dual tasking on
cognitive performance in MCI, as well as the mediating role of brain morphology and
physical/psychological function on gait stability in MCI.

This is the first report to our knowledge that thicker left and total posterior cingulate cortices
were associated with preservation of DFA during dual-tasking. This is in agreement with
previous data showing a greater dual task cost on gait speed (slowing down) is associated with
lower grey matter volume of the hippocampus and cingulate cortex (including both anterior and
posterior cingulate cortex) amongst other regions12. More recently, greater dual task cost on gait
speed was associated with lower entorhinal cortex volume in older adults with MCI11, a region of
the brain known to have structural and functional connections with the posterior cingulate
cortex29,30. The posterior cingulate cortex contributes to motor imagery31, and assists in directing
the focus of attention32,33, and is known to be one of the areas to atrophy early in the course of

Alzheimer’s disease33,34. Posterior cingulate thickness reduction with age, MCI or dementia
could theoretically reduce walking coordination and result in a more variable gait, particularly
during dual-tasking.

We also report for the first time in this cohort that lower left and total hippocampal volume were
associated with greater deficits in stride time variability during dual-tasking. The hippocampus
contributes to rhythmicity of locomotion35 and is known to atrophy in individuals with MCI
faster than in healthy adults36. Hippocampal volume has been associated with gait variability in
both cognitively healthy adults, and adults with cognitive impairment10, but data are lacking
under dual-task conditions. Our findings suggest that hippocampal atrophy associated with MCI
may contribute to a diminished ability to regulate gait dynamics under the stressful condition of
dual-tasking in this cohort.

Notably, we have previously shown that high intensity strength training increases posterior
cingulate thickness17 and that this change in posterior cingulate thickness is directly associated
with the cognitive benefits of the strength training17. While no change in the hippocampus was
observed in SMART17 or other studies of progressive resistance training37, hippocampal volume
has been shown to increase following aerobic exercise in adults with MCI37.

Future

investigations are needed to determine whether gait dynamics under dual-task conditions
improve following structured aerobic or resistance training programs, and if any observed
improvements are mediated by structural brain changes.

Higher aerobic capacity and 6-min walking distance were associated with better preservation of
DFA during dual-tasking. High intensity treadmill training has been shown to improve aerobic
capacity and cognition in adults with amnestic MCI38, whereas most other low-moderate
intensity aerobic interventions have yielded non-significant findings in this cohort39. Progressive
resistance training can also improve aerobic capacity and cognitive function, (mediated by
muscle strength gains), as we have previously shown within this cohort16. However, given the
cross-sectional nature of our analyses, reverse causality cannot be excluded. Individuals with a
less variable gait may be more likely to walk more frequently and thus have a greater aerobic
capacity and functional performance compared to individuals with a more variable gait pattern.
Longitudinal exercise studies are required to investigate whether improved aerobic/walking
capacity will also improve gait variability during single- and dual-task conditions.

Muscle strength was not related to the preservation of either DFA or stride time variability
during dual-task walking. This differs from data we previously reported showing that higher
muscle strength was related to lower variability measures in community-dwelling older adults2,
and that improvements in muscle strength following a multi-modal exercise program were
associated with reduced stride-time variability in older adults with functional impairment40.
However, consistent with the current findings, others have reported that stride time variability in
older adults with higher level gait disorders was not associated with muscle strength24, nor was
step time variability improved by a muscle strengthening intervention41. All of the above studies
only measured gait variability under single-task conditions, and thus, the potential benefit of
interventions to improve muscle strength on gait variability under dual-task conditions are
unknown.

The dual-task cost of stride time variability was greater in those with lower psychological wellbeing (SPWB) across the domains of Environmental Mastery, Personal Growth, Personal
Relations, Purpose in Life and Self-acceptance. These data are in agreement with previous
evidence suggesting that worse stride time variability is associated with an increased fear of
falling24, and fear of falling itself has been previously associated with limitations in physical,
mental and social functioning42. Additionally, MCI has been associated with reduced
psychological wellbeing43 and increased falls2, supporting a potential link between worsened gait
dynamics and poor psychological wellbeing, although reverse causality or bi-directional
relationships cannot be ruled out. Consistent with our findings on psychological well-being,
depression is a well-known risk factor for falls and hip fractures44, independent from antidepressant medications, which pose additional fall risk45. It is important to note however that our
cohort was free from clinical depression at entry into this study by design. Given the known
relationship between hippocampal atrophy and depression46, the potential link between
depressive symptoms, brain morphology and gait dynamics is an important area for future
investigation in relevant high-risk cohorts with this co-morbidity.

Limitations
As noted above, reverse causality may explain some of the study outcomes due to the crosssectional study design. Also, the order of the COWAT assessment and dual-task walking was not
randomized. The presentation of the “F” word task at rest prior to dual-tasking may have
produced a learning effect, minimizing any potential to observe cognitive deficits during dual-

tasking. Future studies should randomize the sequencing of single- and dual-task cognitive
performance.

CONCLUSIONS
Older adults with MCI preserved their cognitive performance at the cost of the variability and
dynamics of their gait under dual-task conditions. Novel associations were observed between
worsening of the fractal scaling exponent of gait and posterior cingulate cortical thickness, while
worsening of stride time variability was associated with lower hippocampal volume. Better
aerobic and walking capacity, psychological wellbeing and static balance were also associated
with preservation gait stability during dual-tasking. Notably, all of these factors have previously
been shown to be modifiable with robust exercise modalities in clinical trials. Longitudinal
research is required to determine the extent to which gait dynamics are also modifiable, and the
optimal exercise prescriptions needed to promote optimization of gait patterns, resilience to
stressors, and ultimately reduce fall risk in vulnerable cohorts.

FIGURE 1: Gait dynamics and cognitive performance under single-task and dual-task walking
conditions.
Graphed results under single-task and dual-task walking conditions for (a) DFA, (b) Stride time
variability (CV) and (c) Letter fluency. Data for (a) and (c) are presented as mean±SD and data
for (b) are presented as median (IQR) with all adjusted pairwise. DFA = detrended fluctuation
analysis fractal scaling exponent; CV = coefficient of variation. Higher scores are worse for CV.
Lower scores are worse for DFA and Letter Fluency.

morphology

Graphed results of gait dynamics and MRI associations for (a) CVCOST and left hippocampal
volume, (b) DFACOST and left posterior cingulate thickness, and (c) DFACOST and total posterior
cingulate thickness. CVCOST = the dual-task cost of stride time variability. DFACOST = the dualtask cost of DFA. DFA = detrended fluctuation analysis fractal scaling exponent.

CV =

coefficient of variation. Cost variables are calculated by subtracting the single-task from the
dual-task. Higher cost indicates greater gait decrement during dual-tasking.
