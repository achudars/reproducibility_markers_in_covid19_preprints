Abstract
Objective The rates of myopia (−0.50 diopter), and high myopia (≥ −6.0 diopter) have been increasing in

100

East Asian populations; the reasons for which may include the combinations of genetic, environment and

101

behavioural factors. The most affected demography point to the young elite population of intellectuals

102

produced from universities. Of the several recommendations to address the myopia epidemic, the influence

103

of Chinese eye exercises (CEE) have been examined. However, reports have been inconsistent, prompting a

104

meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates.

105

Methods Eight articles were included in the meta-analysis where we operated on the hypothesis that CEE

106

either increased or reduced myopia control. We compared the subjects that performed CEE against those that

107

did not. We used and estimated odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the generic

108

inverse variance method. Subgroup analysis involved quality (high/serious and low/non-serious) and

109

frequency (> 5 times/week) of performing CEE comprised. Heterogeneity was subjected to outlier treatment

110

which split the findings into pre- (PRO) and post- (PSO) outlier. The strength of evidence in our findings

111

were based on high significance (Pa < 10-5), surviving the Bonferroni correction and homogeneity (I2 = 0%).

112

Outcomes with these features comprised our core findings.

113

Results Our core findings were found in the PSO overall indicating elevated myopia control (OR 0.72, 95%

114

CI 0.61-0.86, Pa = 0.0002) and CEE subgroups (Serious: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.84, Pa < 10-5; Frequent:

115

OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.68, Pa < 10-5). The low quality subgroup outcome was null in PRO (OR 0.97, 95%

116

CI 0.50-1.86, Pa = 0.92) but conveyed significantly less myopia control in PSO (OR1.57, 95% CI 1.24-2.01,

117

Pa = 0.0002).

118

Conclusions This meta-analysis found that CEE afforded 28% greater control of myopia. Enabled by outlier

119

treatment, this finding was homogeneous and consistent. Subgroup effects elevated myopia control to 62%

120

when CEE was done up to 5 times a week. Improper CEE performance implied reduced myopia control of

121

up to 57%.

Introduction

128

Myopia is one of the most commonly occurring defects of the human eye refraction. Defined as ≥

129

−0.50 diopter (D), this ocular defect has three levels, low (≤−3.0 D), medium (−3.0 D to −5.9 D)

130

and high (≥ −6.0 D). About one-fifth of the myopic global population can develop high myopia

131

(≥ −6.0 D) rendering this eye disorder a significant epidemiological concern [1,2]. This concern is

132

highlighted with a worldwide estimate of ~ 1.4 billion myopic individuals comprising > 20% of the

133

global population [3]. Moreover, this percentage is projected to increase to 50% (~ 4.7 billion) by

134

the year 2050 [3]. This increase in myopia prevalence will have substantial social, educational, and

135

economic consequences to modern society. While geographic distribution of myopia prevalence

136

varies between countries, this eye defect has become epidemic in East and Southeast Asia [3] with

137

the fastest growing tendency pointing to the countries of Singapore and China [4]. Demographic

138

comparisons among 12-year-olds show higher prevalence of myopia in Asians (Singapore: 62%;

139

China: 49.7%) than Caucasians (USA: 20%; Australia: 11.9%) [5,3]. In a study of Chinese

140

schoolchildren, myopia was reported to be present among 33.6% of first graders and 54% of

141

seventh graders [6]. Yet, these percentages pale when compared with older Chinese teenagers and

142

young adults where myopia is present in 90% of this demography [7]. Even more serious

143

prevalence data was shown by a Shanghai study where myopia was present among 94.9% of

144

undergraduate students and 96.9% of postgraduate students, and 19.5% of all myopic students had

145

high myopia [8]. Data from the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China in 2017

146

show that there are about 27.5 million university or college students affected with myopia [9]. Age-

147

wise, myopia currently affects people from 10 to 39 years, but this demographic age range is

148

predicted to widen from 10 to 79 years by the year 2050 [3]. Etiology of myopia is complex with

149

genetic and environmental factors playing a role. Associations of genetic polymorphisms with

150

myopia have been investigated [10-12], so has the impact of family history on the incidence of

151

myopia among children [13,14]. Even high intelligence was shown to be associated with myopia

152

[15]. Consequently, populations with a higher level of education are reported to have higher

153

proportions of myopia [16]. Thus, we look at the intertwining of high educational attainment with

154

genetics as influencing myopia prevalence [17]. The complication of environmental factors

155

affecting myopia is that they are tied to human behavior, which in the modern context, is also

156

tethered to the influence of technology (smartphones and computers). Still, these behavioral factors

157

and technological influence afford greater human direct control compared to genetics in addressing

158

the myopia epidemic. A major contributory factor in the environmental context point to the

159

ubiquitous use of smartphones and computers [7], which dictates the behaviors of those at most risk

160

for myopia. Risk behaviors for myopia include the following: One, high educational pressure in

161

East and Southeast Asia does not permit children to spend extended time outdoors [18,19]. Thus,

162

less outdoor activities promotes sedentary behavior. Two, long hours of exposure to digital screens

163

[20]. Three, continuous reading without rests, has been shown to lead to myopia [21,22]. Myopia

164

not only impacts upon physical health, but also increases risk of eye complications, including

165

myopic retinopathy, myopic glaucoma, retinal detachments, and blindness [23-25]. High myopia (≥

166

−6.0 D) can result in loss of vision due to retinal detachment, neovascularization, cataract,

167

glaucoma, or macular atrophy [1,26]. It can also cause impaired vision and blindness [27].

168

Interventions have been developed to prevent and control myopia [28]. Increased time for outdoor

169

activities could effectively prevent myopia [29-32]. In its presence, however, myopia progression is

170

hindered with low-dose atropine and orthokeratology [33,34]. Even then, these two therapeutic

171

approaches may only be used for myopic control, rather than prevention. Therefore, there is a need

172

to introduce a simple and easy-to-use intervention for myopia control. Chinese eye exercises (CEE),

173

an intervention for visual protection and myopia prevention and progression, originated from the

174

theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine [35]. Yet, reports of CEE effects in preventing myopia

175

have been inconsistent where studies have suggested reduced risk and others have shown risk

increases. This prompted a meta-analysis to obtain a more precise estimate of association. We

177

aim to foster better understanding of the role of CEE in myopia onset and progression.

178

Materials and Methods

179

Selection of studies

180

We searched MEDLINE using PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct for relevant

181

publications as of October 01, 2019. Terms used were “Chinese eye exercises ”, and “myopia”, as

182

medical subject heading and text, unrestricted by language. References cited in the retrieved articles

183

were also screened manually to identify additional eligible studies. In cases of duplicate articles, we

184

selected the one with a later date of publication. Inclusion criteria were (1) case–control design

185

evaluating the association between CEE and myopia; (2) eye exercise in the presence and absence

186

of myopia and (3) presence of raw frequency data or presence of odds ratios (ORs) and 95%

187

confidence intervals (CIs). Exclusion criteria were (1) those not involving myopia and CEE; (2)

188

reviews; and (3) studies whose raw data were unusable/absent. Primary study authors were

189

contacted in order to obtain more information on incomplete data.

190

Data extraction

191

Two investigators (PS and NP) independently extracted data. Disagrements were adjudicated by a

192

third investigator (PT) until arrival at a consensus. The following information were obtained from

193

each publication: first author’s name, published year, country of origin, age of participants, details

194

of the myopia condition, and study design.

195

Data distribution

196

Data distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilks (SW) test using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp.,

197

Armonk, NY, USA). Normal distribution (P > 0.05) warranted descriptive and inferential

198

expressions of mean ± standard deviation (SD) and the parametric approach, respectively.

199

Otherwise, the median with interquartile range (IQR) and non-parametric tests were used,

200

respectively.

201

Methodological quality of the studies

202

We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using two scales that were

203

appropriate to the study design. The Jadad scale [36], for randomized control trials (RCTs) has five

204

questions that examines randomization, double-blind and attrition. It provides a total score that

205

ranges from zero to five, where zero indicates low quality and five, high quality [36]. We used the

206

Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional (xs) and case-control (cc) studies [37]. The

207

based NOS contains eight items with three dimensions (number of

208

comparability (1), and outcome (3). The NOS scores range from zero up to nine

209

zero to 10

210

Risk of bias

211

Risk of bias assessment followed the Cochrane handbook [38], which was applied to cc and RCT

212

study designs [39]. This method evaluates biases originating from sequence generation (selection

213

bias), allocation sequence concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel

214

(performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data

215

(attrition bias), and selective outcome reporting (reporting bias). Every item was judged as either

216

yes, no, or unclear. More items judged as “yes” indicated a low likelihood of bias. In contrast, high

217

likelihood of bias garnered more “no” judgements. Insufficient descriptions merited “unclear”

218

judgment. Judgments were assigned by two of the authors (NP and PT) working independently, and

219

discrepancies were remedied through discussions with a third investigator (PS) to obtain a

220

consensus.

221

Meta-analysis

222

Because we addressed the issues of myopia onset and progression, we hypothesized that performing

223

CEE would afford greater or lesser control of myopia. Greater and lesser control entailed less and

224

more risk, respectively. In order to quantify this control, we assessed the types of data provided by

225

each article, which were ORs and 95% CIs or raw frequency data (number of participants who

-

in parentheses): selection (4),
for cc studies and

for xs studies. Low, moderate and high have scores of < 4, 4-5 and ≥ 6-7, respectively.

226

performed CEE versus those that did not). In the presence of both, we opted to extract the former.

227

Presence of raw data prompted their extraction from each study and were used to calculate study-

228

specific ORs with 95% CIs. The study-specific ORs were transformed logarithmically (log OR).

229

We also derived the standard error (SE) from the 95% CI [40]. Using the generic inverse variant

230

(GIV) method [41], log OR and SE from each paper were entered as the operating data in Review

231

Manager (RevMan) 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England). Subgroup analysis consisted of

232

high quality (HQ)/serious, low quality (LQ) and frequency of performing CEE. Heterogeneity

233

between studies was estimated with the χ2-based Q test [42], with threshold of significance set at Pb

234

< 0.10. Heterogeneity was also quantified with the I2 statistic which measures variability between

235

studies [43]. I2 values of > 75% indicate substantial variability and 0%, zero heterogeneity

236

(homogeneity). Evidence of functional similarities in population features of the studies warranted

237

using the fixed-effects model [44], otherwise the random-effects model [41] was used. Sources of

238

heterogeneity were detected with the Galbraith plot [45] followed by re-analysis (outlier treatment).

239

Of note, outlier treatment dichotomized the comparisons into pre-outlier (PRO) and post-outlier

240

(PSO). Sensitivity analysis, which involves omitting one study at a time and recalculating the

241

pooled OR, was used to test for robustness of the summary effects. Publication bias was considered

242

for assessment if the comparisons met two conditions: (i) ≥ 10 studies only [46] and (ii) significant

243

outcomes. Multiple comparisons were Bonferroni-corrected. Except for heterogeneity estimation

244

[42], two-sided P-values of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Other data were analyzed using

245

SIGMASTAT 2.03, SIGMAPLOT 11.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA) and SPSS 20.0 (IBM Co.,

246

Armonk, NY, USA).

Characteristics of the included studies

270

Table 1 shows the year span of the included articles (2011-2019) and ethnic composition, Chinese

271

(n = 6) and Indian (n = 2). Non-normal (SW: P = 0.022) age distribution of the participants in the

272

collection of studies showed a young demography (median: 12.7 years, IQR: 11.3-20.7).

273

Methodological quality of the component studies was generally high for xs but probably not for

274

RCT studies. S1 and S2 Tables detail the scores for each study based on the Jadad (RCT) and NOS

275

(cc/xs) scales. This meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines (S3 Table).

Risk of bias outcomes

277

Although Fig 2 shows a general low risk of bias based on the six criteria, Fig 3 delineates the poor

278

quality of the Rathod et al study [47] which contrasted with the high quality of Li et al [51] and

Kang et al [48].

Meta-analysis outcomes

306

Table 2 shows six significant outcomes, four of which are attributed to outlier treatment. One

307

finding indicating less myopia control was found in the LQ subgroup (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.24-2.01,

308

Pa = 0.0002). Otherwise, most of the findings indicate greater control of myopia. In PRO, OR

309

magnitude was greater (ORs 0.38-0.49, 95% CIs 0.22-0.82, Pa = 0.0007-0.007) than PSO, whose

310

findings are modulated (ORs 0.55-0.75, 95% CIs 0.45-0.86, Pa < 10-5-0.0002). Significance,

311

however, was greater in PSO (up to Pa < 10-5) than in PRO (up to Pa = 0.0007).

Mechanism of outlier treatment

314

The mechanism of outlier treatment for the CEE analysis is visualized in Figs 4-6. Fig 4 shows the

315

PRO forest plot, non-significant (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48-1.49, Pa = 0.55) and heterogeneous (Pb <

316

10-5, I2 = 94%). The Galbraith plot identifies five studies in three articles [50-52] as the sources of

317

heterogeneity (outliers), located above and below the +2 and -2 confidence limits (Fig 5). In Fig 6,

318

the PSO outcome (outliers omitted) shows eliminated heterogeneity (Pb = 0.95, I2 = 0%); greater

319

myopia control (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.86) and escalated significance (Pa = 0.0002). This

320

operation is numerically summarized in Table 2.

Sensitivity analysis and publication bias

355

Table 3 shows that five of the six significant outcomes were robust. Only the LQ comparison was

356

non-robust on account of one study contributing to its stability [50]. We found no evidence of

357

publication bias (Table 4).

Discussion

360

Summary of associations

361

Our principal findings point to the consistency of significant control of myopia which is supported

362

by homogeneity, robustness and stability. Outlier treatment has unraveled significant and

363

homogeneous associations which were not present in the component single-study outcomes.

364

Conflicting outcomes between primary studies may be attributed to small sample sizes. Outcomes

365

based on small sample sizes appear to be common in clinical studies [55] and are prone to the risk

366

of Type 1 error. Outlier treatment and subgroup analysis underpinned the importance of doing CEE

367

properly and frequently (> 5 time/week) for better myopia control and highlighted the adverse

368

consequence of improper CEE performance. This meta-analysis showed that outcomes were more

369

dependent on xs than cc or RCTs. The xs studies had high sample sizes but not RCTs in our meta-

370

analysis. This is unsurprising since RCTs require greater logistical organization than xs studies,

371

which are mainly questionnaire-based. In fact, two xs studies [52,49] included in our meta-analysis

372

recommended RCTs for better understanding of CEE influence on myopia.

373

Comparison with a 2019 meta-analysis

374

We compare our findings with a recent meta-analysis (Lu et al. 2019) in terms of methodology,

375

findings and conclusion [56]. The initial difference is that Lu et al examined myopia onset only,

376

while we addressed both myopia onset and progression. Despite this difference, both meta-analyses

377

used the GIV approach, lending comparability to the outcomes. Lu et al overall findings indicated

378

increased risk for myopia onset (1.2-fold, n = 4) which contrasted with ours (28% more control of

379

myopia, n = 6). Lu et al stated the harmful effects of low quality CEE on myopia which prompted

380

us meta-analyze the data on low quality CEE from our included studies. Our initial low quality

381

subgroup finding showed a null effect (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.50-1.86, P = 0.92) until it was subjected

382

to outlier treatment, the outcome of which indicated significantly less myopia control (OR 1.57,

383

95% CI 1.24-2.01, P = 0.0002). Thus, our PSO low quality finding concurred with the previous

384

meta-analysis [56].

385

CEE and myopia

386

CEE is an eye-care program that aims to protect against or prevent myopia and is mandated in

387

Chinese schools [51]. Massaging the acupoints around the eyes accelerates the blood circulation,

388

improves metabolism, rests the eye muscles, and relieves eye fatigue [57]. From the perspective of

389

traditional Chinese Medicine, Qi is stimulated in meridians by massaging the acupoints, thus

390

relieving eye strain [48]. By far, performing CEE was found to have a modest protective effect

391

against myopia [52]. In contrast, non-performance of CEE was found to increase the risk for

392

myopia [53]. A third variation in CEE study findings was the non-significant association between

393

performing CEE and risk of myopia onset and myopia progression [48]. These associative

394

variations may be due to the limited sample sizes and lack of rigor in measuring the quality of CEE

395

performed. In schools, most Chinese children were required to perform CEE only once or twice a

396

day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, with 5 minutes for each time. Therefore, the

397

total time of performing CEE was at most 10 minutes a day and in some places the children only

398

performed the exercise once a day [48]. Studies have reported that most children could not perform

399

the CEE with standard manipulation. Previous studies showed that about 90% of Chinese children

400

did not perform CEE correctly, most of them could not find the exact periocular acupoints and did

401

not have accurate pressure and manipulation skills for the exercises although they did them every

402

day [58,59]. Our findings pointed to a significant 57% reduced control of myopia, which may

403

exacerbate the coonidtion when performed improperly. On the other hand, we also showed

404

significantly better control (up to 51%) of myopia (which may retard its progression or reduce the

405

onset) when CEE is performed seriously. About 15% of total children and about a third of those

406

who performed them were found to achieve high quality CEE [48].

407

Strengths and limitations

408

Interpreting our findings should consider its limitations and strengths. Limitations include: (i)

409

Given the greater reliance on RCTs over xs studies [52,49] limits our meta-analysis findings

410

because xs data preclude direct evidence on the association between CEE and myopia [52]. (ii) All

411

the component studies were underpowered; (iii) the low quality subgroup finding was non-robust;

412

(iii) although less prevalent, myopia is not limited to the populations studied here, thus rendering

413

the results inapplicable to other ethnic groups. (v) Clinically, the long-term effect of myopia

414

prevention or slowing its progression remains an open question [51]. (vi) The likelihood of recall

415

bias regarding responses of the participants to the questionnaires may have affected the accuracy of

416

our study. However, impact of these limitations may have been mitigated with our assessments of

417

the risk of bias and methodological quality of the studies. On the other hand, the strengths comprise

418

of the following: (i) our use of the GIV allowed comparison with a previous meta-analysis. (ii)

419

Outlier treatment was key to generating significance and eliminating heterogeneity which

420

underpinned our core findings. This demonstrates the utility of this meta-analysis tool in elevating

421

the level of evidence for associations; (iii) subgroup analysis validated the overall findings, allowed

422

comparison and confirmed the adverse effect of LQ performance of CEE; (iv) all significant PSO

423

ORs survived the Bonferroni correction, thus minimizing the possibility of a Type 1 error; (v)

424

sensitivity treatment conferred robustness to most of the significant findings; (vi) no evidence of

425

publication bias.

426

Conclusions

427

We have shown the significant influence of CEE in controlling myopia, provided the performance

428

was serious and frequent. These findings are buttressed with layers of evidential strength which

429

include high statistical significance, stability and homogeneity.The substantial amount of evidence

430

presented here may render CEE as a useful preventative and therapeutic option in myopia control.

431

In spite of the evidence for associations, the complexity of CEE performance involves interactions

432

between genetic and non-genetic factors that may not have been covered in this meta-analysis

433

because of the logistical limitations. Additional well-designed studies exploring other parameters

434

would confirm or modify our results and add to the extant knowledge about the influence of of CEE

435

in controlling myopia
