Abstract
Background: Frailty is a common but underdiagnosed syndrome among long-term survivors of
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Conditions such as malnutrition, fatigue,
and weakness may suggest frailty despite patients not receiving a formal diagnosis.
Furthermore, the optimal interventions to overcome frailty in long-term survivors of allogeneic
HCT is not yet established.
Patients and Methods: This study consists of a retrospective and prospective component.
First, we completed a retrospective review using diagnosis data from the electronic medical
record to estimate the prevalence of components of frailty in 1077 recipients of allogeneic HCT
through 5 years post-transplant. Second, we developed a community-based pilot study of
strength training for long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT that addressed several common
barriers exercise engagement and adherence. Four allogeneic HCT recipients (2 males, 2
females) and 4 controls (2 males, 2 females) completed the strength training pilot study,
consisting of a baseline assessment, 10 weeks of personalized and supervised strength
programming at least once weekly as a group, and an end-of-study assessment to measure
progress in strength, body composition, and a standardized measure of self-efficacy.
Results: Despite a lack of a formal diagnosis, approximately 80% of HCT recipients in this
series received a diagnosis of a component of frailty (weakness, fatigue, or malnutrition), and
over 1/3 of HCT recipients had symptoms extending beyond 1 year. Over the course of the
strength training pilot study, both pre-frail/frail allogeneic HCT recipients and healthy controls
doubled their total strength, lost body fat, and gained muscle mass. Self-efficacy improved from
baseline in allogeneic HCT recipients after the strength training pilot program.
Discussion: Based upon the prevalence of frailty-related diagnoses among long-term survivors
of HCT, a comprehensive mitigation strategy needs to be developed for this population. A
community-based strength training program that includes a personalized component, a group
setting, and caregiver/partner involvement appears feasible and overcomes several established
barriers to exercise engagement and adherence.

Introduction
Frailty is a clinical syndrome of diminished physiologic reserve and low resistance to
stressors affecting approximately 10% of the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) population.(1)
Frailty can manifest as weakness, low physical activity, exercise intolerance, unintentional
weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, and low-self efficacy.(2, 3) While its manifestations are
common and undoubtedly recognized as expected or “normal” to some extent, frailty is likely
underdiagnosed in HCT recipients. Conditions such as malnutrition, fatigue, and weakness may
suggest frailty despite patients not receiving a formal diagnosis. Because aspects of frailty are
so common after HCT, its root causes, including potential anabolic resistance (4), may not be
adequately addressed by physicians specializing in HCT. Therefore, there is an unmet need to
both increase the recognition of frailty by the medical team and to design and test interventions
to mitigate it.
The optimal interventions to prevent or mitigate frailty in the allogeneic HCT population
are not yet known.

However, strength-based training programs directly address multiple

domains of frailty and have shown success in other clinical settings, including communitydwelling elderly (5), those residing in long-term care facilities (6), and after lung transplantation
(7). We have 2 goals outlined in this paper: (1) estimate the prevalence of components of frailty
in 1077 recipients of allogeneic HCT through 5 years post-transplant using diagnosis data from
the electronic medical record, and (2) perform a community-based pilot study of strength
training in long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT. The results herein are useful to inform the
development of a larger strength-focused longitudinal training program to reverse frailty and
improve quality of life after allogeneic HCT.

Patients and Methods
We performed this study in two parts. We first performed a retrospective review to
estimate frailty from medical diagnosis codes abstracted from the electronic medical record. We
subsequently performed a pilot study to improve frailty in cancer survivors. We describe details
of each cohort below.

Retrospective Cohort
In order to estimate the prevalence of frailty through 5 years post-HCT, we retrieved both
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)9 and ICD10 codes for malnutrition, fatigue, and
weakness from our electronic medical record system spanning 3 post-transplant periods: Day 0
– 100, Day 101 – 365, and 1 – 5 years. Patients (N=1077) in this cohort were adults age 18
years or greater undergoing HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2000-2016.

We

adjusted for mortality by taking into consideration the death rate in each time period. A patient
could be counted for a diagnosis of malnutrition, fatigue, and/or weakness in the time period if
they survived at all during that time period.

Strength Training Pilot Study
We designed a pilot study of community-based strength training designed to address
frailty. Participants (N=4) were required to be at least 18 months post-HCT, meet criteria for
pre-frailty or frailty (all had low energy expenditure and self-reported exhaustion), and have a
healthy exercise partner (spouse or other relative or friend) who could serve as a control (N=4).
Participants in our pilot study received an assessment by a National Academy of Sports
Medicine (NASM)-certified trainer prior to design of a personalized strength training program
during week 1. During weeks 2-11, each participant completed their personalized program at
least weekly as a group under the supervision of the trainer on Saturday mornings, and they
were encouraged but not required to complete additional training sessions as individuals during

the other days of the week. These additional training sessions were unsupervised but followed
the same protocol as the supervised sessions. Each participants’ personalized strength training
program consisted of three lower body exercises, four upper body exercises, three core
exercises, and one aerobic test (example provided in Figure 1). Prescriptions for all exercises
were determined by the number of repetitions at a given weight required to approach muscular
failure in the initial assessment. The large majority of exercises were performed on Free
Motion® machines. These machines have a rotating cable system so that individuals with
different body types and proportions can use the same machines without being limited to a fixed
motor pattern or range of motion.
During the course of the study, specific exercises and their loads were progressed
based on the abilities of each participant. In assessing the progress of individuals during week
12 (final week of study), the estimate of improvement was based on the change in relative
strength. This metric consists of changes in amount of weight lifted (absolute strength) and the
progress in the amount of repetitions completed (work capacity). All of the participants’ workouts
(both those with and without a trainer) were recorded and collected, and the final results were
calculated by comparing subject’s initial assessments with their final workouts. To assess
progress over the trial period, we compared relative strength in each of the muscle groups
comparing the initial and final sessions using descriptive statistics (average, range) without
statistical tests due to the small sample size.

Body Composition
We recorded body composition, including weight, percentage of body fat, and weight of
muscle mass, at the initial and final sessions using an InBody® bioelectrical impedance device.
Participants were counseled that the goal of the study was not to lose weight but rather to gain
muscle mass. No formal dietary intervention was given, but participants learned about healthy

eating habits with a particular focus on eating for muscular growth from a registered dietician
once per month in a group setting.

Self-Efficacy Assessment
The primary endpoint of the strength training pilot study was self-efficacy as determined
by a 6-question survey adapted from the Stanford Patient Education Resource Center (8).
Participants gave a numeric response on a scale of 1 (not confident at all) to 10 (totally
confident) on questions regarding confidence to deal with fatigue, physical discomfort, emotional
distress, managing health problems, reducing dependence on the healthcare system, and
taking steps to improve health beyond medications.

Ethical Considerations
The University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board approved both the retrospective
medical record review and the strength training pilot study. The strength training pilot study is
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03609203.

Results
Estimation of frailty from diagnosis codes
Demographics of the retrospective cohort are detailed in Table 1. The median age of
this cohort was 52 years, with a slight male predominance (58.6% of patients). Table 2 lists the
overall frequency of diagnoses of weakness, malnutrition, and fatigue over the period of 20002016, and Figure 2 shows how these diagnoses overlap in individual patients across early,
intermediate, and late post-HCT recovery.

The majority (79.3%) of adult allogeneic HCT

recipients had a diagnosis of malnutrition (Table 2), weakness (Table 3), and/or fatigue (Table
4) at some time post-HCT. Only 179 patients (21.7%) had none of these diagnoses at any time
point in their post-transplant recovery. Across the 3 time periods, fatigue was the most frequent

diagnosis, with 37% diagnosed with fatigue prior to day 100, 28% diagnosed between days 101
and 365, and 33% diagnosed between years 1-5. The frequency of malnutrition diagnoses
decreased over time, with 22% prior to day 100, 18% between days 101-365, and 16% between
years 1-5. In contrast, the frequency of muscle weakness diagnoses increased over time, with
6% diagnosed prior to day 100, 9% between days 101 – 365, and 11% between years 1-5.
Patients with all 3 diagnoses ranged from 1.8% in the first 100 days, to 3.9% between days 101
– 365, to 4.2% between years 1-5.

Strength Training Pilot Study Outcomes
Four adult allogeneic HCT recipients (2 males, 2 females) and 4 controls (2 males, 2
females) completed the strength training pilot study, consisting of a baseline assessment, 10
weeks of personalized and supervised strength programming at least once weekly as a group,
and an end-of-study assessment to measure progress. Participant engagement was excellent,
there were no serious adverse events related to strength training. The average number of
strength training sessions completed over 10 weeks by participant was 27 (range 17-34). Study
participants doubled their strength on average after 10 weeks, as demonstrated by
improvements of 194% in upper body exercises, and 199% in lower body exercises.
While this was not designed as a weight loss study, most participants lost fat mass.
Average weight loss was 3.0 kilograms over 10 weeks, which reflected in an average change in
body fat of 2.54% as assessed by bioelectrical impedance among study participants (Figure
3B). The average muscle gain as assessed by bioelectrical impedance in allogeneic HCT
recipients was 1.4 kilograms throughout the study, with no net change in the control group
(Figure 3C). However, one female outlier the healthy control group lost a total of 10.8 kg during
the study.
We measured self-efficacy via 6-item survey at the start of the study and at its
completion.

Baseline self-efficacy was lower in recipients of allogeneic HCT than controls

(Figure 4), but increased by an average of 10 points (mean 36.75 to 46.75) in allogeneic HCT
recipients over the course of the study.

Discussion
Frailty is a commonly observed syndrome in the adult HCT population, although it is
typically not diagnosed formally. Frailty does not have its own ICD-10 code; rather, the code
R54 refers to “age-related physical debility” that includes frailty, but excludes sarcopenia and
cognitive decline. Despite not receiving a formal diagnosis of frailty, approximately 80% of HCT
recipients in this series received a diagnosis of a component of frailty (weakness, fatigue, or
malnutrition), and over 1/3 of HCT recipients reported symptoms extending beyond 1 year.
Sarcopenia affects 50% of HCT recipients even prior to HCT leading to an increased risk of late
effects, poor quality of life, and early mortality.(9) Knowing this, and observing the frequency of
frailty-related diagnoses in our series, a comprehensive mitigation strategy needs to be
developed for long-term HCT survivors.
Recipients of HCT can carry several risk factors for frailty including advanced age,
polypharmacy, lack of regular exercise, isolation, malnutrition, and unintentional weight loss (1,
10). Risks traditionally associated with life-threatening complications following SCT have been
substantially mitigated by innovations in supportive care.(11) As a result, there has been a
considerable increase in the number of SCT recipients living with the systemic effects of cancer
and related treatment as a chronic condition.(12) In response, health organizations are now
recommending survivorship interventions founded on the theoretical principles of the Chronic
Care Model with a focus on programs targeting chronic-disease self-management.(13)
Improving patient self-management behavior in the survivorship period has been the focus of
multiple chronic disease programs.(14-17)

Exercise has well-established beneficial effects

including improved quality-of-life and a reduction in untoward cancer-related physical symptoms
(18) and should thus be a key component of such self-management programs.

Perhaps the strongest predictor of health-related self-management behavior is selfefficacy.(19) As defined by Bandura, self-efficacy is the perceived ability or confidence to
achieve a goal, which can be influenced by motivation and task mastery.(20) Increased selfefficacy among cancer survivors appears to have a relationship with exercise participation and
adherence, with higher levels of self-efficacy associated with more exercise behaviors and vice
versa.(19, 21) Understanding the critical role of this phenomenon in promoting and sustaining
positive behavior change, we used the validated Chronic Disease Self-Management 6-Item
scale to assess patient self-efficacy in this pilot study.(8) The scale measures several common
domains of chronic disease including the management of symptoms and health related
activities. Our pilot study found improvements in self-efficacy after the strength training
intervention, but the overall level of self-efficacy still did not match that of healthy control
participants. Self-efficacy may have continued to improve further with a longer study duration.
Our pilot study is one among many other larger studies that have investigated the role of
exercise in recovery from HCT (Table 5). The results from previous interventions may be
variable if the training stimulus was not personalized; either too small to induce muscular
growth, or too large, putting individuals at risk of injury, excess fatigue, or pain. Factors that
enhanced the feasibility of our pilot study is that the intervention was personalized and occurred
in a commercial health club. While the participants were required to meet at least once weekly
as a group at one of the club’s locations, the participants were able to exercise at a club closer
to their home (if applicable) during the week. The required group participation also enhanced
the feasibility and reduced expense, allowing the trainer to supervise 8 participants at once
during the weekly sessions.

The group participation also likely enhanced the sense of

community among participants, as some remarked during the study that they felt less isolated
than they had felt prior to starting the program.

Finally, the partnering of healthy controls

(caregiver, spouse, or other relative or friend) with the HCT recipients may have enhanced
adherence to the program. We also wanted to involve caregivers in the intervention recognizing

the impact of the HCT process on their lives.(22) We did not want to give them yet one more
task to add to their list. Furthermore, involving the caregiver could impact the entire family
dynamic toward adopting healthier lifestyle behaviors despite many perceived barriers when a
loved one is going through the allogeneic HCT process.
In conclusion, frailty is a clinically recognized but underdiagnosed syndrome after
allogeneic HCT. A personalized strength training intervention, conducted along with a caregiver
in a community setting, can help address some of the root causes of frailty, increasing lean
muscle mass and improving self-efficacy. Larger studies are needed to refine our communitybased strength training program for allogeneic HCT survivors and their caregivers prior to
widespread implementation.

Last Week:

The goal is to complete between 10 - 15 repetitions on each exercise with excellent form. Let Jason know if you can easily do more than 15
repetitions with excellent form at your assigned weight. Every week we are trying to do a LITTLE bit more to encourage our body to adapt, grow, and
become MORE capable.
