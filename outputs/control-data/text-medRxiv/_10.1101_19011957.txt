Abstract
Background
In England, national safety guidance recommends that ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem
are prescribed by brand name due to their narrow therapeutic windows and, in the case of
tacrolimus, to reduce the chance of organ transplantation rejection. Various small studies
have shown that changes to electronic health records (EHR) interface can affect prescribing
choices.
Objectives
Our objectives were to assess variation by EHR system in breaches of safety guidance
around prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem; and to conduct user-interface
research into the causes of such breaches.
Methods
We carried out a retrospective cohort study using prescribing data in English primary care.
Participants were English general practices and their respective electronic health records.
The main outcome measures were (1) variation in ratio of breaching / adherent prescribing
all practices (2) description of observations of EHR usage.
Results
A total​ of 2,575,411​ prescriptions were issued in 2018 for ciclosporin, tacrolimus and
diltiazem (over 60mg); of these, 316,119 prescriptions breached NHS guidance (12.3%).
Breaches were most common amongst users of the EMIS EHR (in 23.2% of ciclosporin &
tacrolimus prescriptions, and 22.7% of diltiazem prescriptions); but breaches were observed
in all EHRs.
Conclusion
Design choices in EHR strongly influence safe prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and
diltiazem; and breaches are prevalent in general practices in England. We recommend that
all EHR vendors review their systems to increase safe prescribing of these medicines in line
with national guidance. Almost all clinical practice is now mediated through an EHR system:
further quantitative research into the effect of EHR design on clinical practice is long
overdue.

Introduction
Over 1.1 billion prescriptions are issued through primary care in England each year, at a cost
of £8.8 billion in 2018.​[1]​ The overwhelming majority of these prescriptions are generated
through an electronic health record system,​[2]​ where the clinician selects a medicine from a
“picking list”; specifies directions (e.g. “once daily”); and then signs the prescription either
electronically or on a printed copy. All NHS practices use one of four EHRs made available
through NHS Digital.​[3]​ We have previously described a small design choice in an EHR
medicines selection screen which costs the NHS approximately £9.5million in one year
across a wide range of drugs.​[4]
Tacrolimus and ciclosporin are used in organ transplantation and other conditions such as
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and severe atopic dermatitis. Both medicines have a narrow
therapeutic window: minor differences in blood levels have the potential to cause graft
rejection reactions and switching between tacrolimus products has been associated with
reports of toxicity and graft rejection. Therefore, the Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommend that tacrolimus and ciclosporin are prescribed and
dispensed by brand name.​[5,6]​ Similarly, diltiazem (a calcium channel blocker commonly
used for conditions such as angina and mild to moderate hypertension) should be prescribed
and dispensed by brand for preparations containing greater than 60mg, as different brands
of modified-release formulations with over 60mg diltiazem may not have the same clinical
effect.​[7]
Our team delivers OpenPrescribing.net, a publicly funded and openly accessible data
explorer for NHS primary care prescribing with 130,000 unique users in the past year.
OpenPrescribing.net supports bespoke data queries alongside numerous predefined
standard measures for safety, cost, and effectiveness, with data shared for every practice in
England. Two of these standard measures assess compliance with the guidance to
prescribe a branded preparation of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem (over 60mg).
Through our prior knowledge around EHR design, as clinicians and researchers engaged
with software development, we suspected there may be a relationship between choice of
EHR system and breaches of this safety guidance.
We therefore set out to: describe and map variation between practices and their parent
clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in breaches of safe prescribing guidance for
ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem (over 60mg), and assess the impact of EHR choice on
the proportion of safety breaches. Having identified one EHR system as being strongly
associated with safety breaches, we conducted user-testing to explore the causes of this
association. We aimed to produce a rapid report to support further investigations and any
required software modifications to the EHRs, in light of the patient safety risk.

Methods
Study design
A retrospective cohort study in prescribing data from all English NHS general practices and
CCGs, complemented with data on EHR deployment from NHS Digital; and user-testing of
two commonly used EHRs by a senior pharmacist.
Data Sources
We extracted data from the OpenPrescribing.net database. This imports openly accessible
prescribing data from the large monthly files published by the NHS Business Services
Authority which contain data on cost and items prescribed for each month, for every typical
general practice and CCG in England since mid-2010.[8] The monthly prescribing datasets
contain one row for each different medication and dose, in each prescribing organisation in
NHS primary care in England, describing the number of items (i.e. prescriptions issued) and
the total cost. These data are sourced from community pharmacy claims data and therefore
contain all items that were dispensed. We extracted all available data for standard general
practices, excluding other organisations such as prisons and hospitals, according to the NHS
Digital dataset of practice characteristics and excluded practices that had not prescribed at
least one item per measure. We excluded all other organisations such as prisons and
hospitals. Data on EHRs and in which general practice they are deployed was extracted
from a monthly file that is circulated by NHS Digital to interested parties and available on
request.​[8]
Describe the prevalence of safety breaches by general practices in their implementation of
brand prescribing of prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem
We measured the number of safety breaches and created practice level deciles at each
month for the measure (Table 1) of proportion of brand prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus
and diltiazem (over 60mg).

modified-release items (over 60mg).
Describe variation in safety breaches by EHR
We measured the proportion of safety breaches for prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and
diltiazem for each of the four principle EHRs.
Influence of principle EHR on breaches of safety guidance
We conducted mixed effects logistic regression, to determine the effect size of the EHR
used, and the extent to which CCG membership and other factors affected these estimates.
The independent variable was each prescription as a binary choice between generic and
branded, while the main fixed effect variable was EHR vendor, with CCG membership as a
random effect. Other practice factors were selected ​a priori​ based on their reasonable
availability, as well as clinical judgement. They were: % of patients over 65; % of patients
under 18; % of patients with a long term health condition; dispensing practice status; single
handed practice status; rural/urbanness of practice location; index of multiple deprivation.
Where data for predictor variables were missing, these practices were excluded from the
regression.
EHR System User-Interface Evaluation
One senior pharmacist issued prescriptions in the EMIS and SystmOne computer systems to
a test patient and observed the prompts.
Software and Reproducibility
Data management was performed using Python and Google BigQuery, with analysis carried
out using Stata 13.1 and Python. Data, as well as all code for data management and
analysis is archived online.​[10]
Patient and Public Involvement
Our website OpenPrescribing.net, is an openly accessible data explorer for all NHS England
primary care prescribing data, which receives a large volume of user feedback from
professionals, patients and the public. This feedback is used to refine and prioritise our
informatics tools and research activities. Patients were not formally involved in developing
this specific study design.

Results
Prevalence of safety breaches
In 2018, 316,119 (12.3%) of prescriptions for ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem (over
60mg) breached prescribing safety guidance from a total of ​2,575,411 prescriptions for these
items. Of practices who prescribed ciclosporin or tacrolimus at least once, 2241(41.2%)
breached safety guidance, while 5777 practices (80.4%) breached safety guidance with
regards to diltiazem. The the ratio of safety breaches as a proportion of all prescribing for
these items for practices was a 12.3% ​(10th - 90th percentile range = 0-47%) for diltiazem
and 12.2% (10th - 90th percentile range = 0-67%).
Variation in safety breaches by EHR
Figure 1 shows the mean values for the (a) ciclosporin and tacrolimus and (b) diltiazem
safety breaches as a proportion of all prescribing for the respective items since January
2016. The rate of breaches was consistently highest in EMIS practices and in 2018, 23.2%
of all ciclosporin and tacrolimus prescriptions issued from the EMIS EHR breached safety
prescribing safety guidance while 22.7% diltiazem (over 60mg) prescriptions breached
safety guidance.

The results of the logistic regression are shown in Table 2. When generating a diltiazem
(over 60mg) prescription, practices using the EMIS EHR were around 4 times more likely to
prescribe in breach of guidance with regards to diltiazem than practices using SystmOne,
with a similar size of effect for ciclosporin and tacrolimus breaches. Practices using Microtest
and Vision EHR were substantially less likely to breach safety guidance, although these
practices make up a relatively small proportion of practices. Adjusting for CCG membership
as a random effect had little effect on these estimates, although CCG membership was still
responsible for a high proportion of the variation in propensity to prescribe generically
(16.4% for diltiazem, and 8.4% for ciclosporin). Other factors had even less effect on the
estimates, though some factors were weakly associated with the propensity to prescribe in
breach of guidance (see ​supplementary material​).

EHR System User-Interface Evaluation
EMIS
On reviewing the medicines selection screen it was observed that when searching for a
medicine by its brand name, EMIS always presents the generic version of the medicine as
priority in the medicines picking list: this represents a breach of safety guidance for
ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem (over 60mg). Warnings are presented to prescribers to
prescribe by brand when a generic version of these medicines is selected; however these
warnings appear alongside multiple other warnings such as interactions with other
medications. These warnings take the form of a “pop up” box which can be easily overridden
and the generic version of all three medicines issued.
SystmOne
When the search terms “ciclosporin”, “tacrolimus” or “diltiazem” were inputted, no results are
returned, encouraging a user to search by brand names in line with safety guidance.
However in another part of the user interface screen there is a separate tick-box,
“non-prescribable”. When ticked by a user, input of search terms “ciclosporin”, “tacrolimus” or
“diltiazem” does return results allowing selection of the medicine generically in breach of
safety guidance. A single, standalone “pop up” is presented if the user proceeds, warning of
the importance of brand prescribing. This is in contrast to EMIS were it is presented
alongside other clinical warnings.

Discussion
Summary
A total of 2,575,411 prescriptions were issued in 2018 for ciclosporin, tacrolimus and
diltiazem (over 60mg); of these 316,119 prescriptions breached NHS safety guidance
(12.3%). Breaches were most common amongst users of the EMIS EHR (numbers); but
breaches were observed in all EHRs.
Strengths and weaknesses
We included all typical practices in England, thus minimising the potential for obtaining a
biased sample. We used prescribing data derived from pharmacy claims data used to
calculate the transfer of funds from CCGs to dispensing pharmacies: all parties are
motivated to ensure the accuracy of this data. We excluded a small number of settings such
as walk-in centres, which typically do not issue repeat prescriptions for medicines, and
where no data on EHR usage is available. The data does not distinguish which prescriptions
may have been written by hand without EHR generation; however as 74% of prescriptions
are transmitted electronically ​[2]​ and many more generated electronically and printed on
paper, we do not expect this to substantially affect our results. Our data do not include
hospital medicines data, but we do not expect the same issue associated with EHR design
to occur in hospitals, as medicines are procured differently and the use of electronic
prescribing and EHRs in secondary care in England is limited.​[11]​ Observation of EHR was
limited to one 30 minute session on each EHR with limited scenarios in a single location.
EHRs can be manually adapted and defaults set locally; compliance with safety guidance
may therefore differ between individual practices even with the same EHR systems.
One caveat regarding clinical impact is that the available data reflects prescribing and not
dispensing: in England, when medicines are prescribed generically, pharmacies are entitled
to dispense a brand, and some pharmacists may try to ensure they dispense the same
brand that the patient previously received; however pharmacists are likely to be blocked in
this by lack of access to the patient record, and, commonly, by the absence of information on
specific brand in the patient’s record.​[12]​ In any case occasional remedial interventions do
not affect the key observation that EHR strongly predicts safety breaches among prescribing
clinicians.
Findings in Context
We are aware of no prior work on the prevalence of safety breaches around use of
ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem: however, incomplete implementation of this important
national prescribing safety recommendation is consistent with extensive prior work showing
incomplete or slow adoption for other national prescribing guidance.​[13–15]​ To our
knowledge we are the first group to use natural variation in prescribing behaviour between
EHR systems to identify, explain, and address suboptimal prescribing. A 2017 systematic
review ​[16]​ identified 34 relevant studies exploring the role of computerised systems in
suboptimal prescribing. However, none used quantitative methods to compare different

systems, instead relying on questionnaires to interrogate clinicians about their experiences
of EHRs; qualitative research observing or interviewing clinicians; and descriptions of
clinicians’ spontaneous reports on errors and safety issues in EHR systems.
Various small studies have aimed to evaluate the impact of a single specific new change to a
computerised prescribing system, as a behavioural intervention to increase the probability of
a desired choice being made by clinicians using the system.​[17–21]​ Despite evidence for
effectiveness from “pop-ups”, “alert-fatigue” has also been described, whereby large
numbers of pop-ups can result in salient messages being ignored or disabled by
prescribers.​[22]​ One small mix-method study involving the EMIS EHR found that only three
“pop-ups” from 117 alerts resulted in the GP checking (but not altering) the prescription.​[23]

Policy Implications and Interpretation
Breaches of safety guidance around diltiazem, ciclosporin and tacrolimus can expose
patients to avoidable clinical risk. This is especially important in the case of organ
transplantation where failure to adhere to the safety guidance assessed in our analysis has
resulted in organ rejection ​[6]​. The current World Health Organisation challenge on
medication safety encourages countries to reduce medication errors by 50% by 2022: our
finding represents a clear example of an error amenable to change.​[24]​ We strongly
recommend that picking lists are configured in line with best practice guidelines, and that
compliance with this is audited by national organisations such as NHS Digital and NHSX.
The US National Coordinator for Health Information Technology has made similar
recommendations.​[16,25,26]​ For the specific safety issue raised by our analysis, the
mandated medicines data standard for the NHS (DM+D) already includes a field that can be
used to mandate branded prescribing where this is required by safety guidance; indeed it is
likely that this field triggers the pop-up warnings described above.
Future Research
We are concerned by the relative absence of applied practical research around the EHR
systems used by clinicians to store information, retrieve relevant information rapidly when
assessing a patient, and implement specific clinical actions such as ordering a test or
prescribing a treatment. Healthcare activity is increasingly computerised, and EHR software
is likely to exert a very substantial influence on the way that modern medicine is practiced, in
the same way that the rapid explosion in social media usage has changed the ways that
people interact socially.​[27]​ We can find no previous attempts to evaluate the impact of EHR
design on clinical practice by analysing variation between organisations using different EHR
systems. In our view questions of how best to represent, retrieve, and present knowledge
about patients to clinicians - and the impact this can have on patient care - should be a key
priority for funders and researchers in “digital health”. The NHS spends large sums of money
on EHRs ​[28]​ and there is substantial room for collaborative improvement to make clinical
care safer, cheaper, and more effective.
There is also a role for open standards in this work. We are aware that in most general
practices, complementary decision support systems are deployed alongside the core EHR

system, to support medicines optimisation activity and other aspects of quality improvement.
[29–31]​ However we have been repeatedly blocked from researching the impact of these
“pop-ups” on routine prescribing as there is no national framework or data detailing which
pop-ups are implemented in each setting, and we have been unable to access the data by
private negotiation. NHS commissioners and leaders are also blocked from routinely
monitoring which pop-ups are implemented across the NHS; and from defining or deploying
pop-ups nationally. In our view this represents a failure to set standards and ensure the
proportionate and secure data-sharing necessary to evaluate and improve patient safety.

Summary
National guidance on safe prescribing for ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem is commonly
breached; and the prevalence of safety breaches is strongly influenced by the brand of
electronic health record system. We recommend that EHR vendors immediately review their
systems to mandate safe prescribing of these medicines in line with national guidance; and
that more data and funding is made available to support research into the impact of EHR
design on clinical practice.
