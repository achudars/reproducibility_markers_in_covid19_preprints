Abstract
Introduction: There is increasing evidence linking periodontal infections to Alzheimer’s disease. Saliva
sampling can reveal information about the host and pathogen interactions that can inform about physiological
and pathological brain states.
Methods: A cross-sectional cohort of age-matched subjects (78) was segmented according to their chemosensory
(University of Pennsylvania smell identification test; UPSIT) and cognitive scores (mini-mental score
evaluation; MMSE and clinical dementia rating; CDR). Mid-morning saliva was sampled from each subject and
processed for microbiome composition and cytokine analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to
unravel specific changes in microbial and immunological signatures and logistic regression analysis (LRA) was
employed to identify taxa that varied in abundance among patients’ groups.
Results: Using olfaction we distinguish in the cognitively normal population a segment with high chemosensory
scores (CNh, 27) and another segment with chemosensory scores (CNr, 16) as low as MCI (21) but higher than
the AD group (17). We could identify stage-specific microbial signatures changes but no clear distinct cytokine
profiles. Periodontal pathogen species as F. villosus decline with increasing severity of AD while opportunistic
oral bacteria as L. Wadei shows a significant enrichment MCI. Conclusions: The salivary microbiome indicates
stage-dependent changes in oral bacteria favoring opportunistic bacteria at the expenses of periodontal bacteria,
while the inflammatory profiles remain mainly unchanged in the sampled population.
Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, olfaction, oral microbiome, cytokines.

Background

Olfactory decline is an overarching preclinical sign of dementia and a strong predictor of impending
neurodegenerative processes during aging [1]. Based on the low cost of the olfactory biometric, chemosensory
testings are often implemented in the first medical screening along with memory testing. The University of
Pennsylvania smell identification kit (UPSIT) called also "scratch and smell test" measures olfactory
discrimination and identification, relying on central neural processing from the olfactory bulb to the olfactory
cortices [2]. The olfactory circuitry is one of the first structures displaying a pronounced tauopathy already in
healthy aging [3], and is one of the two central nervous system structures with direct access to the external
environment representing an anatomical port of entry for neurotoxic species that can disseminate to the brain
[1]. In support of the infectious hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a plethora of studies has accumulated
evidence about a dysbiosis of microbial pathogens colonizing the head and neck area and their dissemination to
the brain in the progression of AD [4]. In particular, P. Gingivalis a keystone periodontal pathogen and its
antigens gingipains were found in the brain specimen from AD patients and its abundance correlated positively
with the pathological progression of the disease [5]. Interestingly, levels of P. Gingivalis in saliva were inversely
correlated to CSF in the AD subjects examined suggesting a potential evasion of the periodontal pathogens from
the oral compartment to the brain. In this paper, we have used olfactory and cognitive scores to behaviorally
segment the sampled population. Microbiome composition analysis indicates stage-specific changes but
cytokine profiling indicates only subtle variations in pro-inflammatory chemokines. The present study supports
the use of saliva as a monitoring biofluid for tracking the periodontal oral health in connection with brain aging.

Materials and Methods

The study was approved by the Swiss Ethics Board of the Canton of Vaud and Fribourg under the protocol n.
CER-VD 2016-01627.

2.1. Study Participants
Participants were recruited at the Memory Clinic of the Cantonal Hospital of Fribourg. At the visit, subjects with
cognitive impairment and their accompanying partner, serving as controls, provided written consent and all data
collection was in compliance with the clinical protocol CER-VD 2016-01627 (selection criteria in
Supplementary Table 1). All subjects were asked not to ingest food for at least two hours prior to the
midmorning visit (9-11am). Before starting the test, they rinsed their mouth with an antiseptic solution, washed
their mouth 4 times with water and then underwent cognitive testing (MMSE) and chemosensory probing
(UPSIT, 16 odors [6]) taking typically 30 minutes. CDR assessment was done retrospectively based on the
medical records or the interview with the certified clinical nurse (Table 1). Thereafter, about 2 ml of whole
unstimulated saliva was sampled and processed as previously described [7].

2.2. APOE genotyping and 16S amplicon sequencing
Purified DNA from saliva (Norgen Biotech, Denmark) was genotyped for ApoE variants (ε2, ε3,ε4) using
multiplex tetraprimers amplification according to a published protocol [8]. For the microbiome composition,
V3-V4 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform, using standard
protocols. The raw sequence data are available on request. The estimation of bacterial diversity within and
between samples was performed with qiime2 version qiime2-2019.4 [9]. The Illumina BaseSpace 16S
metagenomics tool was used to characterize the bacterial species, and their abundance, in the patients’ samples.

2.3. Bead-based immunoassay
15 µl of saliva supernatant were probed using an inflammatory cytokines detection kit (Human Inflammation
16-Plex Panel, Aimplex, USA). Samples were run on the BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). The data were evaluated using the open access flow cytometry data analysis software
(http://flowingsoftware.btk.fi/). Outliers were excluded in the final analysis.

Europeans (χ2=1.01, df=1, p=0.5)[10]. The subjects were segmented in groups according to their cognitive
(MMSE and CDR) and olfactory scores (UPSIT; Table 1), of which MMSE and UPSIT are positively correlated
(Supplementary Figure 1, A). In the cognitively normal group, we identify 2 populations, one with high
olfactory scores (CNh=cognitively normal healthy) and one other with hyposmia (CNr=cognitively normal at
risk; t=7.6, p<0.001) (Supplementary Figure 1, B). Mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects identified based on
their MMSE/CDR scores (Table 1) also report hyposmia (t=6.7, p<0.001). Subjects with an MMSE below 20
and CDR larger than 1 are classified as AD and display the most severe olfactory impairment of all groups
(t=8.9, p<0.001).

3.2. Oral microbiome analysis
Bacterial diversity does not differ among groups (Supplementary Figure 1, C) Nevertheless, linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), applied to the oral bacterial content, reveals group-specific microbiome signatures
(Figure 1, A) but less clear inflammatory profiles, based on the sampling of 16 cytokines of the innate and
adaptive immunity (Figure 1, B and Supplementary Table 2). The cladograms (Supplementary Figure 2, A, C
and E) represent the phylogenetic relationship between the bacterial taxa, which vary in abundance in the
pairwise comparison between the CNh group and the CNr, MCI and AD groups. The linear discriminant
analysis effect size (LEfSe) shows a depletion of bacterial taxa in MCI as compared to the other conditions
(Supplementary Figure 2, B, D and F) and a systematic difference in Filifactor species between CNh and the
other conditions. Indeed, Filifactor Villosus (F. Villosus) progressively decreases from CNr to AD (F3,74=3.5,
p<0.05), whereas Leptorichia Wadei (L. Wadei) increases in abundance from CNr to MCI and then decays in
AD (F3,74=5.1, p<0.01). In addition, Porphyromonas Gingivalis (P. Gingivalis) declines in MCI as compared to
CNh (U=376, p<0.001) (Figure 1, D). Species being depleted in MCI as compared to CNh are Prevotella
Tannerae (P. Tannerae; U=358, p=0.05), Filifactor Alocis (F. Alocis; U=399, p=0.05) and Cardiobacterium
Valvarum (C.Valvarum; U=177, p=0.05) (Figure 1, E). Correlation analysis conducted for each group show the
positive interactions among P. Gingivalis and Filifactor species (CNh, MCI and AD) and between P. Gingivalis
and L. Wadei (CNr)(Supplementary Figure 3).

3.3. Predictive value of microbial signatures models
Logistic regression analysis test the predictive values of microbial species that differentiate alone or in
aggregate the clinical groups (CNr, MCI, AD) as opposed to controls (CNh), considering MMSE as the
dependent variable. In the distinction CNh versus CNr, F. Alocis and F. Villosus are the best differentiators of
the conditions (Figure 1, F) with highest sensitivity (0.76 and 0.62) but modest specificity (0.44 and 0.55) and
surpass the aggregate species model (Figure 1, F and Supplementary Figure 4). In the distinction CNh versus
MCI, F. Villosus and L. Wadei are the best differentiators (Figure 1, F’) with moderate sensitivity (0.68 and
0.62) and specificity (0.55 and 0.59), while the aggregate model of all species show the best discriminating
capacity with the highest sensitivity (0.72) and specificity (0.66). In the comparison, CNh versus AD, F.
Villosus and P. Tannerae are the best differentiators (Figure 1, F") with a moderate sensitivity (0.63 and 0.65)
and moderate specificity (0.56 and 0.53). Also in this case, the aggregate model of all species show the best
discriminating capacity with moderate sensitivity (0.67) and specificity (0.60). The mixed model of L. Wadei
combined with UPSIT strongly differentiate CNr, MCI and AD as compared CNh (Figure 1, G-G") with
comparable sensitivity (0.76, 0.75 and 0.78) and moderately high specificity (0.63, 0.68, 0.66).

Discussion

Olfactory deficit is an overarching preclinical sign of dementia [11]. In our study olfactory phenotyping
helped identifying subjects at risk, who retained high cognitive performance but were differentiated based on
their chemosensory scores. These participants displayed an olfactory deficit comparable to MCI, while AD cases
showed the strongest smell deficit, likely aggravated by their cognitive impairment [1]. Our operating
framework, supports that CNr is likely an asymptomatic clinical condition preceding MCI and AD. Along with
the behavioral phenotyping, in an effort to discover novel non-invasive diagnostic methods, we have employed
salivary microbiome profiling with cytokine fingerprinting to assess pathogen-host interaction differentiating
and staging AD. Previous work has shown that saliva can be employed as an accessible biofluid for biomarkers
diagnostic of neurological conditions. A most recent study has indicated that in addition to Amyloid-β [12] and
phosphorylated Tau species [13], which are detectable in the saliva severe patients, the antimicrobial humoral
factor, lactoferrin, declines with the progression of AD [14]. This data strongly suggests a microbial dysbiosis
with dementia progression. Our study using LDA confirms that despite taxa diversity remains unchanged,
whereas there are specific changes in oral bacterial species, which are stage-dependent. LEfSe shows the

strongest depletion in periodontal bacteria in MCI, while Leptorichia species tent to increase from CNr to MCI.
Leptorichias are opportunistic bacteria found in oral biofilm and saliva. Increased amounts of L. Wadei are
associated to rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating the release of antimicrobial chemokines and proinflammatory
mediators, IL-6 and IL-8 [15]. Despite non-significant, our analysis indicates an increase in IL-8 (2 folds) in
CNr and IL-6 (1.8 folds) and MIP-α (6 folds) in MCI. On the other hand, the progressive decline in anaerobic
periodontal Filifactor species [16] is accompanied by a concomitant depletion of keystone periodontopathic
pathogens P. Gingivalis and P. Tannerae. A decrease in P. Gingivalis counts was previously observed in the
saliva from AD patients [5]. The depletion in periodontal taxa suggests either a reduction in number of teeth,
due to earlier periodontal disease, or an oral dysbiosis with the advancement of opportunistic pathogens in AD
subjects. The differentially expressed oral bacterial species alone or in association with UPSIT hold a moderate
to strong predictive value in differentiating between clinical conditions (CNr, MCI and AD) as compared to
healthy controls (AUC=0.67-0.96). Overall, this pilot work indicates that oral microbial signatures may be
employed in larger studies as non-invasive classifiers of dementia alone or in addition to olfactory phenotyping.
