Abstract
Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is among the leading causes of disability in Young Adults
worldwide. Current estimates of MS burden in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) are necessary
for planning effective interventions .To estimate Prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with
disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in EMR by
country age, and sex from 1990 to 2016 .
Methods: We estimated regional and country-specific prevalence, incidence, mortality, DALYs,
YLLs, and YLDs for MS. DALYs were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs.
Results: Total DALYs in EMR countries was 12,810 in 1990 for males and increased to 36,391 in
2016 and from 18,962 to 53,851 for females. Lowest DALYs in both sexes were observed in Somalia
(248) while the highest were in Iran (26,394). YLDs in males increased from 6,511 in 1990 to 19,515
in 2016, and in females from 12,247 to 33,937. The highest age-standardized prevalence, incidence,
YLDs and DALYs were in Iran (72.11, 2.49, 18.03, and 32.5, respectively).
Conclusions: Our findings provide valuable information to guide the development and
implementation of measures to address the rising burden of MS and it consequences in the EMR
countries.

Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of central nervous system
affecting 2.3 million people worldwide (Browne et al., 2014). Disability-adjusted life-years
(DALYs) is a widely used health gap measure which shows differences between a population
and a normative standard of maximum lifespan at full health. DALYs is the sum of years of
life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality and years lived with disability (YLDs) (DALYs
and Collaborators, 2017).
Global prevalence of MS was 2,221 (2,034-2,437) thousands globally in 2016 with a global
incidence of 69 (63-76) thousands. MS mainly affects young adults, thus contributing to 584
(411-764) thousand YLDs globally in 2016 with 24.5 (21.9-26.9) percent increase in counts
compared to 2006 (Disease et al., 2017). Global death for all ages from MS in 2016 was 18.9
(16.6-21.0) thousands with 17.1 (5.4-22.5) percent increase compared to 2006 (Mortality and
Causes of Death, 2017). All-age DALYs globally was 1,151.5 (968.6-1,345.8) in 2016
increased 18.2 (12.8-21.9) percent compared to 2006 (DALYs and Collaborators, 2017).
Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has a population of 583 million people in countries
with varied gross domestic product, health system capacities, surveillance systems, and data
availability due to limited epidemiological studies (Kobelt et al., 2017). A meta-analysis on
the prevalence of MS in Middle East and North Africa showed an overall prevalence of 51.52
per 100,000 in 2015 (Heydarpour et al., 2015).
Despite overall and cause-specific improvements in mortality of MS patients, respiratory
causes of death remain highest cause of excess mortality in MS patients and MS patients have
an increased mortality risk at all ages in a population-based cohort with extended follow-up
(Burkill et al., 2017). A cost of illness study in Europe revealed that costs of MS was
correlated with disease severity (Kobelt et al., 2017). We used results of the Global Burden of

Disease (GBD) 2016 study to report MS burden in EMR countries to inform policy makers of
the current and trend of MS burden.

Methods
GBD 2016 covers 195 countries, 21 regions, and seven super-regions from 1990 to 2016 for
328 diseases and injuries, 2,982 sequelae, and 84 risk factors by age and sex. Detailed
descriptions of GBD 2016 methodology and neurological disorders methodology have been
provided elsewhere (DALYs and Collaborators, 2017; Disease et al., 2017; Factors and
Collaborators, 2017; Group, G.N.D.C., 2017; Mortality and Causes of Death, 2017).
We evaluated the MS burden in 22 EMR countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.
All-cause mortality was first estimated for each country during the period of 1990–2016. For
this purpose, we used all accessible data from vital registration systems, sibling history
surveys, sample registration data, and household recall of deaths. We extracted causes of
death data from the same sources, as well as available verbal autopsies, and then used GBD’s
Cause of Death Ensemble model to estimate the number of deaths from MS by age, sex,
country, and year. In this approach, a large variety of possible models are explored to
estimate trends in causes of death. Possible models are identified based on a covariate
selection algorithm that yields several plausible combinations of covariates; they are then run
through different model classes, including mixed effects linear models and spatiotemporal
Gaussian process regression models for cause fractions and death rates. All models for each
cause of death are then assessed using out-of-sample predictive validity and combined into an
ensemble with optimal out-of-sample predictive performance (Mortality and Causes of
Death, 2017).

We updated our previous systematic reviews for the GBD study separately for each of the
non-fatal sequelae of MS. Non-fatal burden estimates were based on a systematic review of
the literature to obtain all available epidemiological data on prevalence, incidence, risk of
mortality, and severity). List of all sources (by cause and location) are available at the
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s website. A list of GBD sequelae, health states,
health state lay descriptions, and disability weights for MS is provided (Group,
G.B.D.N.D.C., 2017).
Bayesian meta-regression analysis through DisMod-MR 2.1 was used for disease modeling.
Model-based prevalence estimates, in combination with disability weights, were used to
calculate cause-specific YLDs for each age, sex, location, and year. DALYs were calculated
through summation of YLLs and YLDs (DALYs and Collaborators, 2017).
GBD 2015 introduced Socio-demographic Index (SDI) to provide a summary measure of a
geography's socio-demographic development. It is based on average income per person,
educational attainment, and total fertility rate. In GBD 2015, SDI was computed by rescaling
each component to the scale of zero to one, and then taking the geometric mean of these
values for each location-year. Zero indicates the lowest observed educational attainment,
lowest income per capita, and highest fertility rate from 1980 to 2015, and one indicates the
highest observed educational attainment, highest income per capita, and lowest fertility rate
during that time. The global SDI in 2015 was 0.638, and the SDI in this region ranged from
0.150 in Somalia to 0.874 in United Arab Emirates (2015., 2016).
We report 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for each estimate, including rates, numbers of
deaths, and DALYs. We estimated UIs by taking 1000 samples from the posterior
distribution of each quantity and using the 25th- and 975th-ordered draws of the uncertainty
distribution.

by Americas and EMR during 1990 to 2016. As depicted in Figure 4 the highest DALYs
annual percent change in 1990-2016 in this region was observed in Saudi Arabia, Iran and
Oman. The ratio of observed to expected DALYs ratio (O-E ratio) in 1990 varied from 0.55
in Djibouti to 3.21 in Iran, in 2016 O-E ratio varied from 0.56 in Afghanistan to 3.35 in
Yemen. Figure 5A shows the O-E ratio based on SDI in 1990 and Figure 5B is in 2016, there
was no correlation between SDI and O-E ratio and the linear regression was not significant.

Discussion
Our study delivers a comprehensive estimation of prevalence, incidence and DALY of MS
among 22 countries in EMR region with important implications for improving health-care
planning for people with MS. Our findings are of great importance as they indicated a rapid
rise in the burden of MS in the region. With all the health challenges faced in the region,
these results should be used to develop and implement programs to reduce the MS burden
and its consequences on resources and health systems in the future.
Our results showed that the burden varied by country and was higher among females.
Generally, higher female to male ratios of MS in region must be related to the worldwide
increase in incidence of MS among women, a similar tendency was observed in Canada and
Persian Gulf countries over the last few years (Mohammed, 2016; Orton et al., 2006).

We report the highest and lowest prevalence rate in Iran and Somalia, respectively in 2016.
Other studies show in capital city of Iran, MS prevalence had increased to 101.39/100,000
populations in 2014 from 51.9/100,000 in 2008 (Eskandarieh et al., 2017; Sahraian et al.,
2010). According to Kurtzke’s classification order (Kurtzke, 1966), most of countries in
EMR, (15 from 22) considered countries with a high frequency of MS cases (≥30/100,000),
whereas only Somalia is a country with a low frequency of MS cases (<5/100,000) (Kurtzke,
1966).
The prevalence and incidence of MS vary in different parts of region; that may be because
lack of registry system and limited nationwide epidemiological data which affect the
reporting of MS in some Asian countries (Eskandarieh et al., 2016).
Providing nationwide social health insurance and health-care reforms for special target
groups can enable patients to access essential health services and decrease disabilities and
mortality rate of chronic diseases such as MS. Health-related Sustainable Development Goals
(SDG) index is one of predictors of burden of diseases (Sun et al., 2017).
Rising burden of MS in this region also results in higher burden on healthcare personnel and
informal caregivers to MS patients thus more resources will be needed in healthcare systems
to provide for direct and indirect costs of MS. Governments in this region need to plan for
this rise and plan for future rehabilitation needs of these patients. Registries could help better
locate individual patients and address their social and healthcare needs with trained
professionals accordingly. Training Neurologists in this region will eventually result in earlier
detection of disease so preventive measures could be taken to reduce comorbidities and
decrease the long-term disability of patients(Al Tahan et al., 2014; Alroughani et al., 2014;
Yamout et al., 2015).

High income countries in North America and Western Europe have periodically developed
diagnostic and pharmacological treatment guidelines to inform practicing neurologists of
newer medications that might help better control MS. Emerging guidelines from EMR
countries in recent years have been successful in informing healthcare providers in this
region.
During 1990 to 2016, observed over expected for DALYs in the region has decreased for
most of the countries except for Yemen, Somalia and UAE.
Limitations of this study might be due to paucity of epidemiological data on MS in some of
the countries, while various data points from various cities from some of these countries was
available during 1990 to 2016, other countries only had few data point to allow the estimation
of outcomes in this study.

Conclusion
The increasing trend of MS burden and its different pattern from the global trend needs more
investigation. It is important that policy makers and health-care providers be aware of these
increasing trends for providing adequate services for the growing numbers of patients with
MS and also predict for increased burden of MS in future in their countries.
