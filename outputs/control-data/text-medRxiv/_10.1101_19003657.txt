Vaccines against viral infections have been proposed to reduce antibiotic
prescribing and thereby help control resistant bacterial infections. However, by
combining published data sources, we predict that pediatric live attenuated influenza
vaccination in England and Wales will not have a major impact upon antibiotic
consumption or health burdens of resistance.
Antibiotic use drives the spread of antibiotic resistance. A substantial proportion of
antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary because they are written to treat conditions that are
either self-limiting or non-bacterial in etiology (1). Since influenza is often treated
inappropriately with antibiotics, expanding access to influenza vaccines has been proposed as
a means of reducing unnecessary prescribing and preventing resistant infections (2).
In 2013, England and Wales began rolling out the live attenuated influenza vaccine
(LAIV) for 2–16-year-old children (3). Here, we estimate the potential impact on antibiotic
prescribing and antibiotic resistance.
Methods
We assume that some influenza cases lead to general practitioner (GP) consultations
and some GP consultations lead to antibiotic prescriptions. We focus on community
antibiotic use as the driver of resistance, as hospitalizations for influenza are rare relative to
GP consultations (4).
Influenza-attributable consultations — For our base-case influenza-attributable
consultation rate, we use previous estimates from a time-series statistical attribution analysis
over the 1995–2009 UK flu seasons (5), yielding an average of 14.7 influenza-attributable GP
consultations per 1000 person-years (Table 1). For our uncertainty analysis, we use a lower
estimate of 11.8 per 1000, derived from a longitudinal study in England over 2006–2011 (6),
and a higher estimate of 21.4 per 1000, derived from a time-series statistical analysis for
England and Wales over 2000–2008 (4).
Prescriptions per consultation — For our base-case analysis we use a previous UK
average estimate of 726 antibiotic prescriptions for every 1000 influenza-attributable GP
consultations (5). For our uncertainty analysis, we use a lower estimate of 313 per 1000,
based on electronic health records of prescriptions within 30 days of a consultation for
influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute cough in England over 2013–2015 (7).
Vaccine impact — In our base-case analysis, we assume that LAIV prevents 49% of
symptomatic influenza cases on average, from a previously published mathematical model of
pediatric LAIV in England and Wales which assumes 50% uptake and either 70% (matched

years) or 42% (unmatched years) efficacy among 2–16-year-olds (3). This reduction is
consistent with a pilot study comparing consultation rates in treatment versus control areas
before and after LAIV rollout (8). For our uncertainty analysis, we use lower and upper
estimates of 32% and 63% fewer influenza cases from the same model, assuming an uptake
of 30% and 70%, respectively.
Link between antibiotics and resistance — We use linear regression to predict the percountry health burden of each resistant strain as a function of the country’s rate of primarycare antibiotic consumption, using previously published data across EU/EEA countries in
2015 for 16 resistant bacterial strains (9). The regression slope predicts the impact of
reducing antibiotic consumption by a defined amount.
Economic cost of resistance — We adopt a published cost estimate of $1415 per
resistant infection (2016 USD) (10), adjusted for inflation and health care purchasing power
parity for the UK to £520 (2015 GBP).
Further details — We use Monte Carlo sampling to explore uncertainty across
estimates for consultation rate, prescribing rate and LAIV impact, weighting age groups
using demographics for England and Wales in 2015. Analysis code and data are available at
github.com/nicholasdavies/laiv_amr_ew. Additional details are in the Appendix.
Results
We find that LAIV administered to 2–16-year-olds has the potential to reduce
antibiotic consumption by 5.3 (95% highest density interval: 3.7–7.0) prescriptions per 1000
person-years (Table 1) across the population of England and Wales. This is equivalent to
0.8% of the total antibiotic dispensation rate in English primary care in 2015. For comparison
with secular trends, this rate has fallen by 2.5% each year from 2012 to 2018 (Appendix
Figure 1). Focusing on vaccine recipients only, we estimate that the direct effectiveness of
LAIV on antibiotic consumption is 5.8 (4.1 – 7.5) fewer prescriptions per thousand personyears in unmatched years and 9.9 (7.0 – 13) in matched years.
Although 0.8% is a small decrease in antibiotic use, there may be an appreciable
impact on the cost-effectiveness of pediatric LAIV if the health burdens of resistance are
substantial enough (Figure 1). We estimate that LAIV has the potential to reduce resistanceattributable disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by 642, cases by 432 and deaths by 22 per
year in England and Wales (Table 2), with averted DALYs spread relatively evenly across
the 7 causative pathogen species analyzed (Figure 2A). We estimate a yearly cost saving of
£224K for averted resistant infections. When compared with the projected incremental cost

(program cost minus health care saving) of pediatric LAIV at £63.6M, and its projected
impact of saving 27,475 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and averting 799 deaths yearly
(3), accounting for resistance will not substantially increase the cost-effectiveness of pediatric
LAIV in this setting. Our uncertainty analysis (Figure 2B) identifies the consultation rate as
having the greatest influence over the impact of LAIV on health burdens of resistance.
Discussion
Our estimates for the foreseeable reduction in antibiotic prescribing from the LAIV
program in England and Wales may seem surprisingly low, given that sore throat, cough, and
sinusitis together account for 53% of all inappropriate prescribing, which in turn comprises at
least 9–23% of all prescribing in England (1). However, many viral and bacterial pathogens
cause these symptoms. By one estimate, influenza causes only 11% of GP consultations for
acute respiratory illness in England (4), so it may be optimistic to expect influenza
vaccination to substantially reduce antibiotic use in the UK.
Our base-case estimate of 726 antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 influenza-attributable
consultations is more than double what electronic health records suggest (Methods). One
explanation is that this estimate, derived from statistical attribution of antibiotic prescriptions
to influenza circulation over 1995–2009 (5), feasibly includes prescribing for infections
secondary to influenza infection, such as otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia. Also,
antibiotic use in England has declined since this time—by 22% from 1998 to 2016 (11).
Accordingly, our base-case results should be interpreted as the maximum potential reduction
by LAIV of antibiotic use. Conversely, in the FluWatch study only 8% of consultations for
ILI resulted in influenza or ILI being medically recorded (6), and so electronic health records
may not reliably reflect prescribing rates for influenza.
In randomized trials, the direct effect of influenza vaccines on vaccinated children has
ranged from a 44% reduction in antibiotic prescriptions (Italy) to a 6% increase (United
States), both over the 4-month period following vaccination (12). Estimates of the impact
over entire populations (all ages, vaccinated and unvaccinated) range from 11.3 fewer
prescriptions per 1000 person-years in Ontario (13) to 3.9 fewer in South Africa and Senegal
(14). This variation can be ascribed to differences in vaccine efficacy and coverage, influenza
circulation, existing patterns of antibiotic use, and methodology; estimates of vaccine impact
on antibiotic consumption may not be generalizable across settings.
Consistent with our results, UK-specific empirical estimates suggest little or no effect
of LAIV on prescribing. A self-controlled case series study found that 2–4-year-old LAIV

recipients in the UK took 13.5% fewer amoxicillin courses in the 6 months following
vaccination (15), while an LAIV pilot study detected no difference in prescribing rates for
respiratory tract infections between treatment groups (16). No single vaccine is likely to
substantially reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in the UK.

Impact of pediatric influenza vaccination on
antibiotic resistance in England and Wales

Appendix

1. Influenza-attributable GP visits

1.1 Base-case estimate — From Fleming et al. (1) Table 2, consultations for
respiratory disease broadly defined attributable to either influenza A or B. Age
groups reported by Fleming et al. differ from those used in this study, so we adapt
estimates of Fleming et al. by assuming that reported rates are constant within an
age group, and that half of children under 12 months old are under 6 months old.

Fleming et al. do not directly report confidence intervals in measured rates (instead,
variation between flu seasons is reported), so we assume that uncertainty in the
influenza-attributable GP consultation rates follows a normal distribution. We assume
that the standard deviation of any consultation rate derived from this source is
always S times the mean rate, where S is estimated from Fig. 2 of Fleming et al. (1)
by assuming that the width of the 95% confidence intervals on this figure are
equivalent to 1.96 times the standard deviation of an associated normal distribution,
and that the standard deviation of influenza-attributable GP visits is
where
a is the standard deviation of influenza A-attributable consultations and b is the
standard-deviation of influenza B-attributable consultations. S is then the mean
relative standard deviation, calculated in this manner, across all study years.

1.2 Low estimate — Rates of PCR confirmed influenza are estimated from Hayward
et al. (2), Tables S2 and S3, taking the mean over the five winter flu seasons
reported (i.e. excluding the Summer 2009 pandemic flu period), assuming that the
reported rates of PCR confirmed influenza in the form B (A – C) represent a
triangular distribution with B as the peak (mode) and A – C as the 95% highest
density interval (using a triangular distribution rather than a normal distribution allows
us to account for skew). Then, the probability of a GP visit given PCR-confirmed
illness is taken from Table S6 of the same source. We correct for low numbers by
assuming a “base proportion” of 12/82 as the measured proportion of PCR
confirmable influenza episodes resulting in a GP visit, which comes from the overall

number of reported GP visits for 5–64-year-olds with PCR-confirmed influenza. To
account for uncertainty in measurement, we draw the “base rate” of GP consultation
given PCR-confirmable influenza for 5–64-year-olds from a beta distribution with
parameters
(i.e. assuming a uniform prior); to account
for the observation that this rate is higher in young children and the elderly (Table
S6), we add 0.12 to this rate for under-5s and over-65s. The annual influenzaattributable rate of GP consultation for a given age group is then the product of the
PCR-confirmable influenza incidence and the rate of GP consultation given PCRconfirmable influenza.

1.3 High estimate — These are taken from Cromer et al. (3), Table 4, assuming that
reported 95% confidence intervals represent 1.96 times the standard deviation of a
normal distribution.

2. Rate of antibiotic prescribing given an influenza-attributable GP
consultation

2.1 Base-case estimate — From Fleming et al. (1) Table 2, by dividing the rate of
antibiotic prescribing by the rate of influenza-attributable GP consultations, assuming
a normal distribution for the final rate with the same relative standard deviation
derived in 1.1 above.

2.2 Low estimate — From Pouwels et al. (4) Table 3, which reports that 48% of
consultations for acute cough and 29% of consultations for influenza-like illness
result in a systemic antibiotic prescription within 30 days. We assume that 88.1% of
influenza-attributable consultations are for ILI (hence having a 29% prescription rate)
and the rest are for acute respiratory infection without fever (2) (hence having a 48%
prescription rate), which yields an overall (crude) prescribing rate of 31.3%.

To calculate age-stratified values, we assume prescribing for under-5s is about 20%
less, and for over-45s is about 20% more, than prescribing in 5–44-year-olds,
consistent with the results of Fleming et al. (1), Meier et al. (5), and Pitman et al. (6).
That is, we draw a value d from a normal distribution with mean 0.2 and standard
deviation 0.05, and assume that the relative prescribing rate for under-5s is (1 – d)
times the rate for 5–44-year-olds, while the relative prescribing rate for over-45s is (1
+ d) times the rate for 5–44-year-olds.

3. Impact of LAIV on rates of GP consultation

We use fitted models from Baguelin et al. (7) projecting the impact of LAIV on
influenza cases in different age groups, assuming either a 50% uptake (base-case
estimate), 30% uptake (low estimate), or 70% uptake (high estimate).

4. Prediction of prescription rate impact on resistance burdens

4.1 Defined daily doses per prescribed antibiotic course — We assume that each
prescription comprises 7 defined daily doses (DDD), as 7 days is the typical duration
of antibiotic treatment for upper respiratory tract infections (8).

4.2 Main scenario — We use total primary care antibiotic consumption (ATC code
J01C) for European countries for 2015 from the ECDC (9) as the predictor variable,
and per-country median health burden (DALYs, cases, or deaths) attributed to each
of 16 strains analyzed by Cassini et al. (10) as the outcome variable, in a series of
country-level linear regressions from which we separately predict the impact of
reducing overall prescribing by a defined amount.

4.3 Alternative scenario 1 — Rather than using the overall antibiotic consumption,
we also built a separate series of models where we used as predictors each
country’s consumption of tetracyclines (J01AA), extended spectrum penicillins
(J01CA), beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins (J01CE), and macrolides (J01FA), as
these four classes comprise the majority of antibiotics prescribed for sore throat and
cough (11). We assume that for a given reduction in the overall prescription rate x,
there is a reduction 0.0620x in tetracycline prescribing, 0.4752x in extended
spectrum penicillin prescribing, 0.2793x in beta-lactamase sensitive penicillin
prescribing, and 0.1835x in macrolide prescribing. This predicted a smaller impact
upon resistance than the main scenario (4.1) and comprises the “low-effect”
statistical model for the uncertainty analysis (Fig. 2B, main text).

4.4 Alternative scenario 2 — We follow the same procedure as in 4.2, but if any
predictor variable is negatively correlated with a resistance related health burden (i.e.
the best fitting linear model suggests that decreasing use of that antibiotic would
increase resistance), we remove it from the linear regression and rerun the model,
continuing this process until all predictors are positively associated with the outcome
variable. If more than one variable has a negative association in a given round, all
are removed for the next round. This predicted a larger impact upon resistance than

To convert between US and UK health care expenditures, we use hospital-service
price level indices for health care purchasing power parity published by the OECD
(12) (see their Fig. 1).

6. Secular trends in antibiotic prescribing rates

Data from NHS Digital show that community antibiotic use in England has decreased
by approximately 2.5% per year from 2012 to 2018 (Appendix Figure 1).
