ABSTRACT
Introduction ​Common diseases are influenced by a variety of factors that can enhance one
person’s susceptibility to developing a specific condition. Complex traits have been
investigated in several biological levels. One that reflects the high interconnectivity and
interaction of genes, proteins and transcription factors is the transcriptome. In this study, we
disclose the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming at summarizing the
available evidence regarding transcriptomic gene expression levels of peripheral blood
samples comparing subjects with psychiatric, neurological and other common disorders to
healthy controls.
Methods and analysis ​The investigation of the transcriptomic levels in the peripheral
blood enables the unique opportunity to unravel the etiology of common diseases in
patients ​ex-vivo​. However, the experimental results should be minimally consistent across
studies for them to be considered as the best approximation of the true effect. In order to
test this, we will systematically identify all transcriptome studies that compared subjects
with common disorders to their respective control samples. We will apply meta-analyses to
assess the overall differentially expressed genes throughout the studies of each condition.
Ethics and dissemination ​The data that will be used to conduct this study are available
online and have already been published following their own ethical laws. Therefore this
study requires no further ethical approval. The results of this study will be published in

leading peer-reviewed journals of the area and also presented at relevant national and
international conferences.

Strengths and limitations of this study
➢ We present a new and systematically centered method to assess the overall effect of
transcriptomic levels in the blood of subjects with common conditions.
➢ Meta-analyses are a robust statistical method to assess effect sizes across studies.
➢ The analysis is limited by the availability of studies, as well as their quality and
comprehensiveness.
➢ Subgroup and meta-regression analyses will be also limited by the amount and
quality of sample characterization variables made available by original studies.

INTRODUCTION
Common human diseases are generally multifactorial, being influenced by both
environmental and genetic factors that may interact on producing a certain phenotype ​[1,2]​.
Those diseases, related to the central nervous system (CNS) or otherwise, are usually
associated with inflammation as well, which raises the possibility of systemic causal or
resulting effects ​[3–9]​. In neurodegenerative diseases as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s this
association has even inspired the coining of the term “inflammaging” ​[10–12]​.
Diseases as diabetes, hypertension, psychiatric disorders or even continuous
phenotypes, as body mass index (BMI) and height, are usually classified under the umbrella
of complex traits. Those traits are influenced by an ensemble of different genetic variants
and are therefore polygenic and “complex” ​[1,13]​. This theory had already been partially
developed by Fisher in 1919 ​[14]​. Fisher’s “infinitesimal model” takes into account that the
contribution of each variant and gene becomes smaller as the number of genes associated
with a trait grows larger, resulting in a normally distributed phenotype ​[15]​.
More recently, researchers have proposed that complex traits are not only
polygenic, but also “omnigenic”. The hypothesis of the omnigenic model states that all
genes expressed in disease-relevant cells can actually affect core disease-related genes
because of highly interconnected regulatory networks. This idea would suggest that a great
amount of the heritability of those traits can also be explained by the influence of genes
outside core pathways ​[13]​. While this theory is nonetheless important to understand the
etiology of complex traits, when referring ourselves to common diseases this should be
translated into something that can be also applied therapeutically. In this sense, the
continuing research on which pathways are mainly responsible for common diseases
susceptibility remains crucial.
Multi-omics data has been vastly produced in the last few years from different types
of human tissue and in several biological levels, such as in the genome, transcriptome,
proteome, and even the microbiome. All these layers interact with each other and assessing
a full perspective of the omics data has been one of the greatest challenges of today’s

bioinformatics and biostatistics research ​[16–18]​. However, the evidence is not even
consolidated or provenly consistent across different studies within each omic. One of the
most robust and widely applied statistical methods to solve similar problems in
epidemiology is meta-analyzing data subsequently to a well-conducted systematic review
of the literature in order to estimate overall effect sizes ​[19]​. Having in mind that the
interacting protein networks that influence diseases are mainly related to the regulation of
gene expression, we have chosen to focus our study on the transcriptome level. Moreover,
as tissue sample availability that is representative of common diseases is scarce, due to high
heterogeneity and complexity, the investigation of peripheral factors becomes imperative.
This is especially true for brain disorders and, as stated before, systemic effects might bring
valuable insight to the matter. Hence, we have chosen to investigate transcriptomic
differences in the most abundantly collected peripheral tissue: blood; which will hopefully
solve inconsistencies across the field.
This study, therefore, aims at summarizing the available evidence regarding
transcriptomic gene expression levels of blood samples comparing subjects with
psychiatric, neurological and other common disorders to healthy controls. With this
approach, we intend to identify the overall scenario regarding mRNA expression levels
profile of complex traits, hopefully clarifying major inconsistencies in the field. Here we
disclose the protocols for a systematic review and meta-analysis with the purpose of
standardizing our methodology in order to increase quality and comprehensiveness, making
it possible to be meticulously replicated hereafter.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
For the present study report, we have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) ​[20]​.

Eligibility criteria
We will include studies that compared the gene expression levels in blood of
patients with psychiatric, neurological, and other common disorders with healthy controls.
We will include experimental studies that assessed gene expression levels by coding
mRNA quantification through both microarray and RNA-sequencing methodology. Only
studies with a specified control or resilience group will be considered. We will include
randomized clinical trials (RCTs), cohort, and / or case-control studies, provided that they
present a control group without specific and unique treatment administration. Studies
should have collected blood samples (leukocytes, lymphocytes, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)) from patients affected with the disorder and healthy (or
resilient) controls. All types of diagnosis will be included regardless of diagnosis manual or
tool. Nevertheless, the diagnosis manual/tool will be included as variables in later
sensitivity analyses. We have not imposed any restrictions regarding publication date,
language or methodological quality, as well as age, sex or ethnicity of participants.
The following exclusion criteria will be applied: i) studies with a sample that
comprises only genetically related individuals (​e.g.​ family-based studies); ii)

studies

without original data; iii) studies in which every case has a unique type of comorbidity; iv)
studies without healthy (or resilient) controls; v) studies in which remitters are referred to
as healthy controls; vi) studies in which the blood samples received any kind of treatment
ex vivo before microarray analysis or RNA-sequencing; and vii) studies in which all the
case sample was receiving a specific type of drug that is not listed as “treatment as usual”,
such as the mainly prescripted drug or class of drugs.

Search and study identification
Studies will be identified through an online search using two different electronic
databases: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (​https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds​) and
ArrayExpress (​https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/​). No search filters will be used and the
reference list of published studies that were included will be searched for additional
independent records. A further database search will be conducted for studies published
since the last search date in GEO.
Search strategies will include subject headings for each disorder/disease (​Table 1​),
indication for studies with human subjects, and blood. Full search strategies will be
provided upon the final publication of the completed study.

Study selection
Study selection and inclusion will be performed in two steps. Firstly through title
screening evaluation and secondly, by full GEO / ArrayExpress description details perusal.
Both will be conducted by at least two independent reviewers (ACP, ATT, MSW, CSG, LS
or AKT). Disagreements will be resolved in consultation with a third reviewer (ACP or
JCFM).

Data collection
The descriptive data of each study will be extracted by at least two independent
reviewers (ACP, ATT, MSW, CSG, LS or AKT). Discrepancies will be resolved by a third
reviewer (ACP or JCFM). Data will be extracted as follows: description of studies (sample
size, age mean and standard deviation, gender frequencies in the sample, ethnicity and
country/region of origin, date of data collection, type of platform used for transcriptome
analyses, diagnostic manual / tool, and data on medication or psychotherapy being used).
The transcriptomic outcome data (raw and/or normalized gene expression data) will be
assessed through the ​GEOquery R package ​[21] or by downloading directly from the GEO

and/or ArrayExpress websites. Whenever there is missing data, the authors of the original
studies will be contacted. If no response is received in two months, the study will be
excluded from the analyses.

Outcome measures
Our primary outcome measure is mRNA levels assessed through microarray (or any
other kind of specific array) or by RNA-sequencing methods. Those measures are available
in full in the online repositories, and we will, therefore, be able to have access to raw data
most of the time. Normalized data will not be a problem in the analyses, as we can convert
raw data into normalized if the information on which method was used is provided.
Whenever only the mean and standard deviation/error values are provided, the
meta-analysis will still remain possible after appropriate measurement conversions.

Bias assessment
Risk of bias will be assessed by two independent raters (ACP and MSW) through
the NIH Quality Assessment of Case-Control Studies tool ​[22]​. Any discrepancies in the
assessment will be resolved through discussion and, where necessary, by a third rater
(JCFM). Studies are rated as presenting high, unclear or low risk of bias. The NIH Quality
Assessment tool comprises 12 questions about methodology quality of original case-control
studies. However, we chose not to evaluate items 9 to 11, since they are not an issue in
transcriptomic studies. This is because the exposure assessment, in this case, is performed
by the automatic measurement of microarray or RNA-sequencing of samples. Furthermore,
publication bias will be assessed using funnel plots and Egger’s regression test ​[23]​.

Data synthesis
Gene expression data will be collapsed into one variable for each disorder through
the ​MetaMA R
​ package ​[24] and the overall differentially expressed genes computed.
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for every study descriptive characteristics (e.g.
gender, age, diagnostic tool, etc.) in which groups of at least three studies are formed.
Heterogeneity and subgroup analyses
Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed using both the 𝜒² and the I² tests, in
which a p-value ≤0.1 will be considered statistically significant in the first, and I² values of
25%, 50% and 75% will be considered as low, moderate and high heterogeneity,
respectively. We will conduct separate analyses of studies in groups by gender, age, and
ethnicity of subjects when the data is available. We will also separate studies by
disorder/disease subtypes or symptom grouping when pertinent, and by diagnostic tool
when the data is available. Whether studies present high heterogeneity, we will also
perform meta-regression analyses when enough data is available.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses will be also performed in order to evaluate result differences
related to the effects of individual or specific groups of studies. The following sensitivity
analysis are planed: i) the jackknife method, a common procedure used to test the stability
of the outcome after excluding one result at a time ​[25]​, ii) excluding studies without
formal diagnostic criteria from the analyses, and iii) excluding studies presenting a
concerning risk of bias (the 25% worst ranked studies). The exploratory objectives of our
sensitivity analyses will be to i) observe if any study skews the overall result, ii) examining
the impact of studies without formal diagnostic criteria, and iii) evaluate the impact of
studies with a high risk of bias.

Pilot study
Each step of the analyses described above will be primarily tested in a pilot study,
with a selected set of conditions, which are indicated by an asterisk in ​Table 1​. We have
chosen this set ambitioning to have more data on a broad variety of common conditions.
This pilot study was thought of with the purpose of detecting possible misdesigns in the
methodology and spot eventual issues that may emerge during the execution of the
systematic review and/or meta-analysis.
