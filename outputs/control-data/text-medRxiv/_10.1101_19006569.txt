Abstract

29

Background: Low back pain is a common condition among older adults that significantly influences

30

physical function and participation. Compared to their younger counterparts, there is limited information

31

available about the clinical course of low back pain in older people, in particularly those presenting for

32

chiropractic care. Improving our understanding of this patient population and the course of their low back

33

pain may provide input for studies researching safer and more effective care than is currently provided.

34

Objectives: The primary objectives are to examine the clinical course over one year of the intensity,

35

healthcare costs and improvement rates of low back pain in people 55 years and older who visit a

36

chiropractor for a new episode of low back pain.

37

Methods: An international prospective, multi-center cohort study with one-year follow-up. Chiropractic

38

practices are to be recruited in the Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom and Australia. Treatment will be

39

left to the discretion of the chiropractor. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: Patients 55 years and older who are

40

accepted for care having presented to a chiropractor with a new episode of low back pain and who have not

41

been to a chiropractor in the previous six months for an episode of low back pain are to be included,

42

independent of whether or not they have seen another type of health care provider. Patients who are unable

43

to complete the web-based questionnaires because of language restrictions or those with computer literacy

44

restrictions will be excluded as well as those with cognitive disorders. In addition, those with a suspected

45

tumor, fracture, infection or any other potential red flag or condition considered to be a contraindication for

46

chiropractic care will be excluded. Data will be collected using online questionnaires at baseline, and at 2

47

and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

51

Background

52

Worldwide, low back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability and contributes to the global

53

burden of disease (1,2). Low back pain is associated with decreased mobility, reduced social participation,

54

increased isolation and difficulty with activities of daily living and thus has a negative effect on overall

55

health-related quality-of-life in older adults. Older adults with low back pain also more commonly suffer

56

from a range of co-morbidities when compared to those without low back pain (3,4). This results in large

57

costs of care, which are estimated to exceed €400 billion per year worldwide (5).

58

Low back pain is generally more severe with increasing age (6). For example, one in every four people

59

aged >80 years will report moderate to severe low back pain and people aged >80 years are three times

60

more likely to have high intensity low back pain (scores >50, on a zero to 100 scale) than those aged 50-59

61

years (7). One-fifth of older adults with low back pain report difficulties in caring for themselves at home

62

or participating in family- and social activities (8). Older people seeking care because of low back pain

63

more commonly receive treatments that have been shown to be ineffective and harmful such as opioid

64

prescription, spinal injections or surgery than younger people seeking care for low back pain (9).

65

Chiropractors provide a significant portion of care for patients with low back pain (10), and care from

66

chiropractors in the younger and older population appears to be safe and effective (16–18). Unfortunately,

67

existing trials have typically included only younger adults with low back pain, and exclude older adults for

68

various complicating reasons, such as comorbidity and polypharmacy (19-21). As a significant proportion

69

of chiropractors treat older adults (16), it is important to understand the course and characteristics of low

70

back pain in older adults under this care. Perhaps more importantly, chiropractic care may delay functional

71

decline in older adults and improve self-rated health (17,18).

72

In short, there is a general lack of knowledge regarding low back pain in older adults, but more importantly,

73

data are lacking on course of low back pain for this population in a chiropractic setting (15,19).

74

The current BACE-C consortium study has been modelled after the ‘BAck Complaints in Elders’ study

75

(BACE), which is an international cohort study devoted to examining back complaints in older people in

76

primary care (23). The BACE-C study is set in chiropractic care. The primary objectives are to examine the

77

clinical course over one year of the intensity, healthcare costs and improvement rates of low back pain in

78

people 55 years and older who visit a chiropractor for a new episode of low back pain.

79

Methods

80

Study design. This study is designed as an international, multi-center prospective cohort study. Data are to

81

be collected from patients 55 and older with low back pain who visit a chiropractor. Follow-up

82

measurements will be scheduled at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at one year after

83

the first treatment. Participants are to be recruited from the private practices of chiropractors in the

84

Netherlands, Sweden, Australia and the United Kingdom using the same recruitment strategies. The

85

procedures and design outlined in this paper are to be followed by the participating countries and describe

86

a common set of primary outcome measures and patient- and chiropractic factors to be measured. Care will

87

be at the discretion of the participating chiropractors. Ethics approval will be obtained in each participating

88

country prior to data collection.

89
90

Participants

91

Inclusion criteria: Patients aged 55 and older who consult a chiropractor for an episode of low back pain

92

regardless of duration, either for the first time or patients who have not been to a chiropractor in the previous

93

six months are to be recruited, independent of whether or not they have seen another type of health care

94

provider for the current episode. All low back complaints, with pain in the region from the thoracolumbar

95

12th rib junction to the first sacral vertebrae, including pelvic pain and pain referral to the leg(s) are to be

96

included.

97

Exclusion criteria: Patients who are unable to complete the web-based questionnaires because of language

98

restrictions or computer literacy restrictions will be excluded as well as those with cognitive disorders. In

99

addition, those with a suspected tumor, fracture, infection or any other potential red flag or condition

100

considered to be a contraindication for chiropractic care will be excluded.

101
102

Inclusion Procedure

103

Participating chiropractors will be asked to refer all potential participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria

104

to the online questionnaire, preferably prior to the first appointment. Participants will be briefly informed

105

about the study procedures over the phone when they call to make an appointment or during the initial

106

consultation with the chiropractor. The chiropractor or chiropractic assistant will ask for the patient’s

107

permission to send an email with a link to the informed consent and baseline questionnaire, so that it can

108

be completed at home prior to the first visit or as soon as possible and no later than two weeks after the

109

initial visit. Figure 1 shows the proposed flow of patient inclusion.

110
111

Questionnaires

112

Links to the questionnaires will be sent by email and completed as a web-based questionnaire at baseline,

113

2 and 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the initial visit. In Sweden data will not be collected after

114

6 weeks because of logistical burden. Table 1 shows the measurements per follow-up round and the time

115

frame for data collection.

116

The primary outcome measures are: 1) low back pain intensity, 2) back-specific functional status and 3)

117

global perceived effect. As a secondary measure, 4) healthcare costs will be measured. All outcomes are

118

self-reported.

119

Patient-related factors: The following factors will be measured at baseline: 1) sociodemographic

120

characteristics (i.e. age, gender, marital status, education level, height, weight); 2) physical activity

121

(measured with the International Physical Activity questionnaire (20)); 3) other lifestyle variables smoking;

122

measured by pack years (21), alcohol use measured by the short version of the AUDIT-C (22,23), sleeping

123

habits; measured by the short version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (24); 4) comorbidities using

124

the Self-administered Comorbidity Questionnaire (25) and 7) indicator screening tool (STarT Back) for

125

poor outcome (26) and 5) quality-of-life measured with the EQ-5D-5L at baseline only. In Sweden the EQ-

126

5D-3L will be used. The EQ-5D measures five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities,

127

pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression (28,29).

128

In the Netherlands, each chiropractor will also perform at the first consult the “timed Up & Go” test (30).

129

The “timed Up & Go” test is composed of a variety of movements which are necessary for daily activities:

130

walking, standing up, turning, stopping, and sitting down; and predictive of falls in the elderly (30). In

131

previous studies, this test showed associations with quality-of-life scores (31).

132

Pain: Pain intensity will first be measured using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) (32) in which 0

133

represents ‘no pain ‘and 10 represents ‘the worst pain ever’. Second, several questions about the severity

134

and reoccurrence of complaints will be asked at all follow-up measurements (table 1).

135

Back-specific functional status: Functional status will be measured at baseline and all follow-up intervals

136

using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) (33), in which total score can range from 0 (no

137

disabilities) to 24 (severe disabilities).

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

138

Global perceived effect: Global perceived effect (GPE) will be measured on a 7-point scale, ranging from

139

‘completely recovered’ to ‘worse than ever’ (33,34). Patients will be asked to provide additional (open-

140

ended) explanation if they report worse or much worse global perceived effect compared to the previous

141

follow-up measurement. GPE will be dichotomized for the analyses as follows: ‘completely recovered’ and

142

‘much better’ will be considered ‘improved’, while all other responses will be considered ‘not improved’

143

(35).

144

Healthcare consumption: Healthcare consumption will include the use of all primary health care (e.g.

145

general practitioner, physiotherapist), all secondary healthcare (e.g. hospital based neurologist, orthopedic

146

surgeon), hospitalization, complementary care (e.g. acupuncture, dry needling, massage) as well as the use

147

of both prescribed and over the counter medication. Questions were adapted based on the iMTA medical

148

consumption questionnaire (36). Healthcare consumption characteristics will be valued in accordance with

149

costing guidelines of each participating country, such as the Dutch Manual of Costing (37).

150

Chiropractor-related factors: These variables will be obtained from the chiropractors themselves: 1)

151

sociodemographic (age, gender), school attended (school, year of graduation), and types of treatments

152

commonly delivered in their practice.

153

In the Netherlands and in Sweden, each chiropractor will be asked to fill in several questions about their

154

expectations of patient recovery. This will be asked at the first four treatment visits.

155
156

Statistical analyses

157

Descriptive analyses: Baseline variables will be presented as percentages for categorical variables and as

158

means plus standard deviations for continuous variables. In case of non-normal distributions, continuous

159

variables will be described as medians with corresponding interquartile ranges. Furthermore, descriptive

160

information of the primary and secondary outcome variables will be presented for baseline and all follow-

161

up intervals. Descriptive analyses will be conducted for the entire data set from all participating countries

162

as well as stratified for each country.

163

The primary objective will be answered using the entire data set from all participating countries and

164

subsequently stratified by country.

165

In addition, the primary objective will be answered for each primary outcome separately by multilevel

166

models with three levels (observations over time clustered within patients, clustered within practices).

167

Country will be included as a covariate in the models (as dummy variables) (38). The models will thus

168

include time as a continuous variable as well as country as independent variables. Potential need for time

169

squared and time cubed will be investigated by assessing the significance level of the quadratic and/or cubic

170

terms. A random intercept will be included a priori. The need for a random slope for time will be

171

investigated by the likelihood ratio test, in a stepwise manner (38).

172

The clinical course of pain and back-specific functional status will be analyzed by linear multilevel models,

173

global perceived effect by logistic multilevel models and healthcare costs by a linear multilevel model with

174

bootstrapped confidence intervals because of the expected skewed distribution of the cost data. We will

175

report regression coefficients (linear models), odds ratios (logistic models), corresponding 95% confidence

176

intervals and two-sided p-values.

Discussion

178

This study is to our knowledge the first large-scale, prospective, multicenter, international study to be

179

conducted in a chiropractic setting and the first one focusing on older adults with low back pain consulting

180

a chiropractor. The primary objectives of the BACE-C study are to examine the clinical course over one

181

year of the intensity, healthcare costs and improvement rates of low back pain in people 55 and older who

182

visit a chiropractor for a new episode of low back pain. By understanding the impacts of various factors on

183

the course and treatment of low back pain in the elderly population, this large data set will allow us to

184

provide input for the development of future feasibility intervention studies in this patient group. We invite

185

other research groups worldwide to join the BACE-C consortium.

186
187

Data Management, Storage and Security

188

Data will be stored on institutional network drives with firewalls and security measures in place according

189

to national and European Union data protection regulations. Hard copy records will be stored in a locked

190

cabinet in a secure location. Access to records and data will be limited to study personnel. Study data will

191

be de-identified and a master log file with identifiers will be kept and stored separately from the data. Only

192

anonymized data will be used for analyses.
