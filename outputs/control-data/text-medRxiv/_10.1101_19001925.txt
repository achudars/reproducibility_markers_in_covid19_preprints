ABSTRACT

23

Background: Prior candidate gene studies have shown tumor suppressor DNA methylation in

24

breast milk related with history of breast biopsy, an established risk factor for breast cancer. To

25

further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of

26

breast carcinogenesis we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women

27

with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts.

28

Methods: DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast

29

milk samples. After quality control, 368,171 autosomal CpG loci were analyzed. Cell type

30

proportion estimates from RefFreeCellMix were calculated and adjusted for in this Epigenome

31

Wide Association Study using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy,

32

age, time of delivery, cell type proportion estimates, array chip, and subject as random effect.

33

Results: Epigenome-wide analyses identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated

34

with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the breast that

35

would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer (q-value <

36

0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in

37

cases compared with controls, and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat

38

element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases

39

exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age

40

compared with controls.

41

Conclusion: Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease

42

risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors, and

43

improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.

46

Breast cancer is the most common non-keratinocyte cancer in women in the USA, with over

47

270,000 new cases each year [1]. Established risk factors for breast cancer include age,

48

reproductive history, and family history of disease and can be used to estimate disease risk

49

[2,3]. Additionally, and beyond the recognized role of inherited BRCA mutation, individual

50

germline genetic variants, and even polygenic risk scores from genome-wide association

51

studies have also contributed to breast cancer risk assessment [4–6]. Nonetheless, a large gap

52

in the capacity to predict breast cancer risk remains, and the molecular basis of breast cancer

53

risk and carcinogenesis has largely not been studied using target-organ biospecimens from

54

premenopausal women.

55

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), using surrogate tissues such as peripheral blood

56

DNA, have also had some success testing the relation of DNA methylation with cancer risk [7–

57

9]. However, unlike genetic variation and germline alterations that confer cancer risk, cytosine

58

modifications that contribute to cancer risk as disease initiating and promoting events are

59

overwhelmingly tissue specific. Defining and leveraging knowledge of tissue-specific early DNA

60

methylation alterations for screening or risk models in normal, nontumor human tissues is

61

challenging for most common tumor types. Yet, use of breast-specific substrate to investigate

62

breast cancer risk has shown promise in early studies measuring cell composition, cytology, and

63

candidate gene DNA methylation from nipple aspirate fluid, though as a substrate, nipple

64

aspirate fluid can be challenging to obtain and typically yields very low volume [10–14].

65

Recently, the utility of altered DNA methylation in cancer screening and risk assessment was

66

established in colon cancer as part of the Cologuard multi-target assay where a tissue-specific

67

biospecimen (stool) is obtained and measured without using an invasive procedure [15].

68
69

The majority of extensive DNA methylation alterations observed in invasive breast cancer

70

compared with normal breast tissue, are already present in pre-invasive disease [16], [17]. In

71

addition, age-related variation in normal breast tissue DNA methylation has been shown to

72

occur at CpG sites that are more likely to be altered in breast tumors [18], suggesting that early

73

measures of DNA methylation in the pathologically normal breast has value as a biomarker for

74

future breast cancer risk [18]. Typically, mammary epithelial cells cannot be accessed without

75

invasive procedures (breast biopsy), lavage, or other relatively impractical methods. However,

76

exfoliated mammary epithelial cells are abundant in breast milk [19], a tissue-specific substrate

77

obtained without invasive procedure. These cells are an excellent target for biomarker

78

development, and prior candidate gene studies have shown that methylation-induced silencing

79

of tumor suppressor genes in breast milk is related with history of breast biopsy, an established

80

risk factor for breast cancer [20–22]. Given that 85% of 40 year-old women in the USA have

81

given birth [23], breast milk is a viable noninvasive source of mammary epithelial cells [24]. We

82

investigate the relation of early epigenetic alterations with breast cancer risk using cells

83

obtained from breast milk in controls compared with prospectively collected milk specimens

84

from subjects who were later diagnosed with breast cancer.

85

METHODS

86

Study population

87

Two different study populations were included in this study: 1) women from the “Molecular

88

Biomarkers for Assessing Breast-Cancer Risk” project at the University of Massachusetts

89

Amherst (UMass), and 2) participants of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort study (NHBCS) at

90

Dartmouth College. UMass subjects were women older than 18 years of age. They were either

91

lactating or have recently given birth, and they had a history of either breast biopsy or breast

92

cancer. UMass subjects were asked to provide one or two breast milk samples expressed in a

93

single pumping session. NHBCS participants characteristics has been described previously [25].

94

Briefly, NHBCS eligibility criteria included: English speaking, literate, and mentally competent

95

women carrying a singleton pregnancy, 18–45 years of age, and whose primary source of

96

residential water was a private well. Women who planned to move during pregnancy were

97

excluded from this study. NHBCS participants were asked to bring bilateral breast milk samples

98

to the postpartum follow-up appointment. All study participants provided written informed

99

consent prior to the study according to the guidelines of Institutional Review Board of the

100

University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects

101

at Dartmouth. Women in both studies were asked to complete a questionnaire about general

102

health, reproductive health, and personal breast biopsy and breast cancer history. Each

103

woman’s samples were classified into five different groups: (1) no breast cancer history, (2)

104

healthy breast, contralateral breast cancer before donation, (3) ipsilateral breast cancer

105

diagnosis before donation, (4) healthy breast, contralateral cancer diagnosis after donation, and

106

(5) sample from the ipsilateral breast with cancer after donation. For this analysis, we report the

107

results of model milk samples from control subjects and from subjects with a subsequent

108

diagnosis of breast cancer.

109

Sample collection

110

Using a previously described method [24], breast milk was processed within 24 hours of sample

111

collection to obtain DNA. Briefly, DNA was extracted from 1 - 10 mL of milk from each breast

112

and stored at -20 °C until DNA extraction.

113

DNA extraction and genome-wide DNA methylation array

114

DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and

115

bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA). Samples were

116

randomized across several plates and subsequently subjected to epigenome-wide DNA

117

methylation assessment using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, which

118

measured ~485,000 CpG sites genome-wide (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Microarrays were

119

processed at USC core facility following standard protocols. The data were assembled using

120

GenomeStudio methylation software (Illumina, San Diego, CA) without normalization per the

121

manufacturer’s instructions. The methylation status for each individual CpG locus (β-value) was

122

calculated as the ratio of fluorescent signals (β = Max(M,0)/ [Max(M,0) + Max(U,0) + 100]),

123

ranging from 0 (no methylation) to 1 (complete methylation) using the average probe intensity

124

for the methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) alleles. We read the idat files using the minfi R

125

package [26]. β-values were background corrected using methylumi-noob and normalized using

126

functional normalization.[27] Our pipeline included array control probes to assess sample quality

127

and evaluate potential problems such as poor bisulfite conversion or color-specific issues for

128

each array as described previously [28,29]. All CpG loci on X and Y chromosomes, CpH, and

129

loci with potential problems of cross-reactivity, tracking to polymorphisms with minor allele

130

frequencies over 5% for the general population, or common copy number alterations,[30] were

131

excluded from the analysis, leaving 368,171 autosomal CpG loci in 92 samples. Principal

132

components analysis and multiple dimension scaling were used to identify potential technical

133

batches. Additionally, we used a principal component regression analysis to investigate the top

134

eight principal components in relation to potential batch-associated differences. Subjects with

135

missing covariate data were excluded from modeling, resulting in 87 samples. DNA methylation

136

β-values were logit2 transformed to M-values for the analyses [31].

137

Cell mixture analysis

138

In order to identify and adjust for potential cell type heterogeneity in the breast milk samples we

139

used a reference-free decomposition (RefFreeCellMix) of the DNA methylation matrix into cell-

140

type distributions and cell-type methylomes, using the expression Y = Μ*ΩΤ [32]. We explored a

141

range of k cell types from 2 to 10. Note that the decomposition will be based on Y, but Yfinal (=Y

142

by default) was used to determine the final value of M based on the last iterated value of Ω)

144

We implemented a locus-by-locus analysis to identify differentially methylated CpG sites

145

between samples obtained from control subjects without breast cancer diagnosis and those

146

from healthy and diseased breasts before or after the cancer development using the R package

147

limma [33]. Five groups were compared: 1) Controls with no breast cancer history, 2)

148

Contralateral Prior Diagnosis (sample from healthy breast of a woman previously diagnosed

149

breast cancer), 3) Ipsilateral Prior Diagnosis (sample from affected breast of a woman

150

previously diagnosed breast cancer) 4) Contralateral New Diagnosis (sample from healthy

151

breast of a woman with incident breast cancer), and 5) Ipsilateral New Diagnosis (sample from

152

affected breast of a woman with incident breast cancer). Briefly, linear mixed effects models

153

were fit to each CpG site separately, with the CpG β-value as the response against the five

154

groups. A random effect for subject was included to control for within subject correlation in

155

subjects with bilateral samples (30 subjects). The models were adjusted for time from delivery

156

(in months), maternal age (in years), RefFreeCellMix proportion estimates (5 putative cell

157

types), and the microarray Slide to control residual batch confounding. P-values were adjusted

158

for multiple comparisons by computing the Benjamini–Hochberg q-values [34], and we defined

159

loci with q-value < 0.05 to be statistically significant. We focus on CpGs identified as

160

differentially methylated in both prospectively diagnosed groups (ipsilateral and contralateral),

161

and report individual group results in supplemental material. All analyses were carried out using

162

the R statistical package, version 3.5.0 (Vienna, Austria; www.r-project.org/) [35].

163

Repetitive elements prediction and analysis

164

We use the package REMP, Repetitive Element Methylation Prediction [36], to estimate the

165

DNA methylation levels on both LINE-1 and Alu transposons using the information from the

166

DNA methylation microarray. This random forest approach covers 37 Alu subfamilies and 115

167

LINE-1 subfamilies. We computed the average Alu and LINE-1 methylation levels for each

168

sample, and tested the association with prospectively diagnosed breast cancer, excluding the

169

three samples from subjects with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer. P-values were computed

170

using the Kenward-Roger approach.

171

Enrichment analyses

172

The probes that were differentially methylated were tested for pathway and gene set enrichment

173

using missMethyl [37] and the MSigDB v.6.2 curated database [38]. A minimum of two genes

174

were required for further exploring the specific pathway. We also tested for over- or

175

underrepresentation of differentially methylated CpGs identified in the locus-by-locus analysis in

176

1) enhancer regions and 2) CpG island regions. Loci with a q-value < 0.05 were considered to

177

be statistically significant. Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P-values were computed

178

with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and were adjusted for probe type.

179

Predicted methylation age and stem cell divisions

180

We used Horvath’s DNA methylation age estimation algorithm [39] to calculate predicted

181

methylation age (

182

) using the agep function from wateRmelon [40]. Using those estimates,
age acceleration was defined as:   
    . We tested for differences in

183

age acceleration between control subjects and subjects with breast cancer using a linear mixed

184

effects model. P-values were calculated using the Kenward-Roger approach. Additionally, stem

185

cell divisions were estimated using the epiTOC method [41], but only 334 of 385 CpGs were

186

available to calculate estimates. epiTOC estimates were compared between cases and controls

187

using unadjusted linear mixed effect models analogously to the age acceleration models.

188

RESULTS

189

Genome-scale DNA methylation was measured in breast milk samples from 87 subjects using

190

the Illumina HumanMethylation450 beadchip. Subject demographic and sample details are

191

provided in Table 1. 64 (73%) samples were from cancer-free subjects and 23 were from

192

subjects who had a breast cancer diagnosis of which 20 (87%) were collected prior to diagnosis.

193

Milk samples from subjects with any breast cancer diagnosis were classified according to

194

whether the cancer was in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast. Overall, about 70% of samples

195

from subjects with subsequent breast cancer were collected from the ipsilateral breast (n=14)

196

and 30% were from the contralateral breast (n=6).

We used a reference-free cell type estimation approach to identify the number of putative cell

200

types and the proportions of each cell type in each breast milk sample. The reference-free

201

method identified five putative cell types in human milk. In unadjusted models, we observed

202

differences in cell type proportions between breast milk samples from women who did not

203

developed breast cancer (henceforth named as “controls”) compared with those diagnosed with

204

breast cancer for three of the five putative cell types. The proportions of cell types 2 and 3 were

205

higher in subjects with a prospective diagnosis of breast cancer than controls (P=5.2E-06 and

206

7.1E-04), and the proportion of cell type 4 was lower in milk from subjects with breast cancer

207

compared to controls (P=1.2E-05) (Figure 1). In these models, differential abundance of

208

putative cell types in controls versus cases was similar irrespective of whether the samples

209

were from the ipsilateral or contralateral breast, or whether the breast cancer diagnosis

210

occurred prior or subsequent to breast milk sample collection (see figure Additional File 1).

211

After adjusting for maternal age (years), time since delivery (months), and BeadArray slide

212

number, cell type proportions were no longer associated with breast cancer diagnosis.

213

DNA methylation was compared using linear mixed effect models adjusted for time since

214

delivery in months, maternal age in years, estimated cell type proportions, and array chip with

215

subject as a random effect. We identified 57 significantly differentially methylated CpG sites

216

associated with milk from the ipsilateral breast after correction for multiple comparisons (q-value

217

< 0.05). Among these 57 CpGs, one CpG in an island region and associated with both the

218

LRRC61 and ACTR3C genes was significantly hypermethylated in breast milk from subjects

219

who were later diagnosed with breast cancer (Figure 2). The remaining 56 CpG sites were

220

significantly hypomethylated in prospectively collected breast milk from the ipsilateral breast of

221

subjects who developed cancer compared with controls (Figure 2). The most statistically

222

significantly hypomethylated CpG site related to breast cancer diagnosis was located in the

223

island region of the CLCC1 gene. Additional genes with hypomethylated loci included TMSB10,

224

ZNF584, MAP10 (previously KIAA1383), TRIM27, and SEPTIN7 (previously SEPT7). A total of

225

32 of these CpGs also were hypomethylated in prospectively collected milk from women who

226

developed cancer in the contralateral breast compared to controls (Table 2). The full set of the

227

EWAS results are available as Additional Files 2 and 3.

We accessed TCGA breast tumor data using cBioportal to determine whether genes we

235

identified as having hypomethylated CpGs related to breast cancer were associated with gene

236

regulation. We found negative correlations between DNA methylation with mRNA expression z-

237

scores (RNA seq) for many of these genes including ZNF584 (P=2.41E-17), MAP10 (P=1.61E-

238

76), TRIM27 (P=6.01E-14), LIMD2 (P=1.14E-59), and LDHA (P=6.06E-06). In contrast, there

239

was little to no correlation between DNA methylation and expression of CLCC1 (Spearman ρ=-

240

0.03, P=0.5), TMSB10 (ρ = -0.08, P=0.07) and SEPTIN7 (ρ =-0.05, P=0.2), see Additional File

241

4. The range of DNA methylation level observed for each CpG tested in the TCGA tumors was

242

comparable to that observed in our samples.

243

Given the preponderance of CpG-specific breast milk DNA hypomethylation associated with

244

breast cancer, and that repeat element hypomethylation is well established in cancer, we further

245

assessed repetitive element methylation. To do so, we inferred Alu (37 subfamilies) and LINE-1

246

(115 subfamilies) DNA methylation using array data and the repetitive element methylation

247

prediction (REMP), as detailed in the methods section. None of the individual repetitive

248

elements reached statistical significance after multiple comparison correction. The nominally

249

significant are summarized in Additional File 5, Table S5. Mean Alu subfamily methylation was

250

significantly lower in breast cancer cases compared to controls (β = -0.21, p-value = 2.9E-4),

251

and mean LINE-1 subfamily methylation was also lower in cases than controls (β = -0.073, p-

252

value = 0.10) (Figure 3).

253

To evaluate the location in the genome where breast cancer-related DNA methylation

254

alterations in breast milk were occurring we performed enrichment analyses for both genomic

context and gene sets. Differentially methylated CpGs (q-value<0.05) associated with a

256

subsequent diagnosis of breast cancer were enriched for CpG island regions in milk from both

257

the ipsilateral and contralateral breast (Table 3). Among CpGs whose methylation was

258

significantly related with cancer diagnosis we also tested for enrichment of gene sets using the

259

molecular signatures database (MSigDB) v. 6.2, and identified 7 gene sets enriched for the 32

260

CpG sites that were differentially methylated in both ipsilateral and contralateral samples. The

261

top two pathways are related to highly conserved motif clusters matching transcription factor

262

binding sites [42]. Three pathways are related to upregulation of genes in CD8(+) T

263

lymphocytes, T regulatory cells and dendritic cells. Finally, two gene sets are associated to

264

tumor invasion [43] and granulocyte differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia [44] , see

breast cancer status. In the adjusted analyses, putative cell type proportions were related to

276

epiTOC estimates and age acceleration.

277

DISCUSSION

278

We identified significant differences in DNA methylation after controlling for cell type and other

279

confounders in subjects with a subsequent diagnosis of breast cancer compared with controls.

280

In the subjects who were diagnosed with breast cancer after the milk collection, nearly all of the

281

significantly differentially methylated CpGs were hypomethylated. Several of the genes whose

282

CpG sites were differentially methylated in prospectively diagnosed cases have previously been

283

associated with breast cancer. For example, TMSB10 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells,

284

has elevated protein expression in serum of breast cancer patients, and is elevated with

285

increasing breast cancer stage and distant metastasis [45]. Linking a systemic marker of breast

286

cancer risk to our tissue-specific approach, promoter CpG island hypomethylation of ZNF584

287

was associated with a breast cancer diagnosis both here and in peripheral blood DNA from

288

breast cancer patients [46]. Further, using TCGA breast tumor data, we showed the functional

289

relationship of ZNF584 DNA methylation with gene expression. We also observed

290

hypomethylation at CpGs in SEPTIN7, TRIM27, LIMD2, and LDHA, which have been

291

associated with breast cancer metastasis, invasion, and proliferation, [47–50]. Apart from

292

SEPTIN7, all these genes showed negative correlation between gene expression and DNA

293

methylation in TCGA breast cancer samples, again demonstrating functional consequences of

294

altered DNA methylation to gene regulation. These results support our hypothesis that

295

epigenetic alterations in human milk have utility for noninvasive molecular assessment of breast

296

cancer risk.

297

Amongst subjects with incident breast cancer, the group of hypomethylated CpGs found to be

298

significantly differentially methylated in milk samples from both contralateral and ipsilateral

299

breast compared to those from controls were enriched for CpG island regions. Methylation at

300

CpG island regions can reduce gene expression in associated genes [51]. Since the majority of

301

differentially methylated CpGs were hypomethylated, this may correspond to increased

302

expression of genes with promoters in these regions, and consistent with our observations of

303

local and potentially systemic effects, our pathway enrichment analyses identified both proto-

304

oncogene signatures and immune dysregulation signatures. One pathway with strong

305

enrichment is associated with a motif for the ELK-1 a regulator of the c-Fos protooncogene

306

which has been linked to growth suppression in breast cancer cells [52]. The second pathway

307

includes CpGs related to a motif for SP-1, a part of the Kruppel-like family that also has been

308

associated as a prognostic factor in breast cancer [53]. Three more pathways pointed to genes

309

upregulated in CD8(+) T lymphocytes, activated T-regulatory cells, and dendritic cells,

310

cornerstones of tumor immune response in breast cancer murine models [54]. The remaining

311

two pathways were related to tumor invasion and granulocyte differentiation.

312

We also observed differences in measures of methylation age including the epiTOC estimator

313

and Horvath’s methylation age between breast cancer subjects and control subjects, but these

314

associations were not robust to adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, in our study

315

population the subjects with a cancer diagnosis were slightly older than control subjects.

316

Putative cell type proportions, however, were related to all measures of methylation age.

317

Although CpG loci utilized in each algorithm are not supposed to be dependent on cell type,

318

there have been consistent trends of accelerated age in breast tissues when using the Horvath

319

methylation age approach. Accelerated biologic age inferred using DNA methylation has

320

recently been associated with breast cancer risk in a very large prospective study using

321

peripheral blood [55]. However, to date, unlike peripheral blood, there are no DNA methylation

322

clocks for inference of biologic age that are calibrated to biospecimens from the breast. In the

323

future, larger breast-tissue-specific studies are needed to advance our understanding and

324

opportunity to leverage biologic age estimates for breast cancer risk assessment and primary

325

prevention.

326

This study has several strengths and limitations. Strengths of our study include the use of

327

prospectively collected specimens, tissue-specific measures of DNA methylation, and two

328

independent cohorts. Although some subjects were potentially had clinically occult disease

329

when providing a milk specimen, others were not diagnosed until years later. One limitation of

330

this study is sample size, though investigating genome-scale DNA methylation measures in

331

breast milk is novel. One potential limitation is that we pooled controls from two different cohorts

332

processed in different technical batches. Although we controlled for technical differences in our

333

models and used a conservative approach that adjusted for cell estimates which also captures

334

technical differences, we cannot completely exclude some residual technical noise between

335

cohorts affecting our results.

336

We identified early DNA methylation alterations in breast milk associated with subsequent

337

breast cancer occurrence. These loci were either in genes expressed in breast cancers, related

338

to breast cancer progression, or found in peripheral blood samples women with breast cancer.

339

Importantly, because we identified both overlapping results with work that used peripheral blood

340

as a surrogate biospecimen and results distinct to breast milk we expect that our tissue-specific

341

approach has high potential for follow up work. We expect that future investigations of DNA

342

methylation changes present in cells from breast milk from disease-free women will have value

343

for risk assessment and primary prevention of breast cancer, perhaps with specific strength in

344

application to premenopausal disease. However, larger studies are needed to validate our

345

findings and to further establish the utility of breast milk as a biospecimen for understanding the

346

molecular basis of disease risk and prospective risk assessment.

We assessed genome wide DNA methylation in breast milk from subjects with and without

349

breast cancer, specific loci were hypomethylated in breast cancer subjects compared to control

350

subjects. These differentially methylated regions were more likely to occur in island regions of

351

the genome. Our results suggest that breast milk has utility for prospective assessment of

352

breast cancer risk.
