Abstract
Introduction: Epilepsy is chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent derangement of the
nervous system due to the sudden excessive disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. People
living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths,
misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. Therefore, this study
aimed to assess the community general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy.
Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assess public general
knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors using structured pretested
questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and transported to SPSS version 21
further analysis. Both Bivariable and Multivariable Logistic Regression was done to identify
associated factors. Odds Ratios and their 95% Confidence interval were computed and variables
with p-value less than 0.05 was considered significantly associated factors.
Results: 596 study participants participated in a response rate of 98%. Among the study
participants, 43.6 (95% CI: 39.6, 47.5) had poor knowledge and 41.3 (95% CI: 37.4, 45.1) had an
unfavorable attitude. Being secondary education, marital status, witnessed a seizure and heard
the term epilepsy were showed statistically significant association with poor knowledge about
epilepsy. Level of education, low average monthly income, not witnessed a seizure, not heard the
term epilepsy and distant from health facility showed statically significant association with the
unfavorable attitude.
Conclusion In this study, Debre Berhan communities were found to have deficits in terms of
general knowledge and attitude about epilepsy; and it should be given due attention.

1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent derangement of the nervous
system due to the sudden excessive disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons that results in an
almost instantaneous disturbance of sensation and loss of consciousness(1). It is becoming a
burden for more than 70 million people in the world. Nearly 80% of the people with epilepsy are
found in developing countries, where the disease remains a major public health problem, not
only because of its health implications but also for its social, cultural, psychological and
economic effects (2, 3). Epilepsy contributed more than 7 million to the global burden of
diseases in 2000 measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). It is apparent that close to
90% of the worldwide burden of epilepsy is found in developing regions, with more than half
occurring in the 39% of the global population living in countries with the highest levels of
premature mortality, the lowest levels of premature mortality and the least levels of income(4, 5).
The reported prevalence of active epilepsy in developing countries ranges from 5 to 10 per 1,000
people, and it is more prevalent in rural communities(6, 7). Universally and all over history,
epilepsy has been culturally an undervalued condition(8). Epileptic patients and their families
have suffered isolation by society and deprivation of treatment, leading to frequent injuries and
death (9). Epilepsy is a fascinating topic by nature and is poorly understood by the public, even
among people who know someone with the disorder. Lack of knowledge about the causes of
epilepsy has been associated with negative attitudes, beliefs, and stigma (3, 6, 10). Lack of
understanding about epilepsy is a leading cause of discrimination in the workplace and in schools
(11).
Most studies showed that a high number of people ever heard about epilepsy. However, most of
them had a lower level of knowledge. A significant number of people argued that epilepsy is a
mental disease, hereditary disease, contagious, evil spirit or God’s curse (12, 13). Due to the
negative attitude towards epilepsy, many people do not want to work or live with epileptics.
Large numbers of people do not want even to shake hands with epileptic individuals, and they try
to keep their children away from these patients (14).
The Causes and risk factors of epilepsy include head injury, perinatal cause, infectious disease,
brain tumor, cerebrovascular disease, febrile convulsions and familial past history of epilepsy

The annual incidences and prevalence of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa is high (63–158 per100
000 inhabitants) and 15 per 1000 people respectively. The mean sex ratio of men to women is
1:4 in studies from sub-Saharan Africa(15).
The incidence of epilepsy in Ethiopia is 64 per 100,000. The age-specific incidence was highest
in the group aged 0-9 years; the next highest incidence was that in the group aged 10-19 years;
the third highest was in the group aged 20-29 years(16).
People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on
myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. In the last
decade, there has been an increase in individual literacy rate and increased access to technology
in Debre Berhan population. However, it is unclear if this has any effect on knowledge, attitude,
and practice (KAP) attitude toward epilepsy.
Fear, misunderstanding, lack of awareness, wrong beliefs and the resulting social stigma and
discrimination compounding epilepsy make epileptic patients live poor quality life(17).
Sociocultural attitudes continue to cause a negative impact on the management of epilepsy in
many African nations. The disorder is enrobed in superstition, discrimination, and stigma in
many of these states. Religious and sociocultural beliefs influence the nature of treatment and
maintenance received by people with epilepsy. Many communities in Africa and other
developing countries believe that epilepsy results from witchcraft or possession by evil spirits,
and hence, treatment should be through the use of herbs from traditional doctors, fetish priests,
and religious leaders. Persons with epilepsy are rejected and discriminated against in education,
employment, and marriage in Africa because epilepsy is seen as a highly contagious and
shameful disease in the eyes of the public(18).
A compiled data of articles across the world showed that the magnitude of poor knowledge
towards epilepsy ranges from 40% to 86 % (19-23). Unfavorable attitude also ranges from 28%
to 87% (11, 21-26) Studying knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy in Debre Berhan town
enables to know the level of poor knowledge and unfavorable attitude and also it enables to dig
out the factors that result in poor knowledge and unfavorable attitude.

Having poor knowledge and unfavorable attitude results in stigmatization and this stigmatization
results in delay in medical treatment or medication adherence problems.
Findings could benefit policymakers, the district health team, community members, affected
families, and people with epilepsy in designing strategies. Furthermore, the study possibly
generates information in the area of the topic for large scale researchers to investigate further
empirical evidence to control those factors attributable to poor knowledge and unfavorable
attitude towards epilepsy in the study area.
This study aimed at studying the magnitude of knowledge and attitude of Debre Berhan
community towards epilepsy and associated factors for poor community’s knowledge and
unfavorable community’s attitude.

2. Methods
The study was conducted at Debre Berhan; the largest town of North Shewa of Amhara region
which is located 130 km northeast of Addis Ababa from February 28- March 1, 2019. The total
sample size of the study was 596 with a response rate of 98%. The source population was all
households in Debre Berhan town. The study population was all households found in the selected
Kebele. Each selected Household’s and avails during the data collection period were sampling
units of the study and each individual in the selected household in which the actual data is
collected were study units. Individuals who are severely ill to give the desired information were
excluded from the study. Authors had selected 2 Kebele (22%) out of the total 9 Kebele using
lottery method. Then using systematic random sampling method households for our study from
the selected Kebele were selected by using a sampling fraction 8 and our starting household
selected by using lottery method from the first 8 households, since we don’t have sampling frame
we gave a code for every house. For those households that had more than one eligible
participants, 1 study unit was selected by using the lottery method.
2.1. Study variables and operational definitions
The data was collected by using pretested 10 and 12 item screening tools adopted from related
studies for knowledge and attitude respectively. The data collectors have interviewed the study
participants in the households that can address the common socio-demographic, information and
experience, and health facility related characteristics and questions that can assess the
community’s knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy. The data were collected by five trained
undergraduate degree students. The questioner was translated from English to Amharic and back
to English to check the consistency. To ensure quality, data were checked for completeness,
accuracy, clarity, and consistency by the principal investigator. To maintain the quality of the
data the questionnaire was pre-tested among 5% (30 individuals) of the study households, and
the pretested data was not included in data analysis. Intensive training for data collectors and
Close supervision was held during the whole data collection period by the research advisor. The
first draft of the questionnaire was evaluated by our advisers. Every morning of the study period,
Orientation was given to members of data collectors and supervisors about how to take timely
action to minimize errors. The reliability of the checklist was cheeked by Cronbach’s test and it
was 0.9 for attitude and 0.81 for knowledge screening tools.

Independent variables:
Socio-demographic factors: - age, sex, religion, marital status, address, academic status,
residence, family role, ethnicity.
Health facility factor: - availability, distance
Experience with epilepsy: - having a family member with epilepsy, having epileptic friend,
witnessed a seizure
Information factors: - magazines, TV, radios, family members, health care provider, training
Dependent variables: Level of Knowledge and Attitude towards epilepsy
Attitude: The section on attitude had 12 items and four Likert scale response options consisting
of ‘strongly agree, agree, disagree and strongly disagree’. The response options were given
(scored) a point of 4, 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The minimum score is 12 and the maximum score
is 48. Individuals who scored below the mean (x =34) and ≥ mean (x =34) were categorized
as unfavorable and favorable attitude respectively.
Knowledge: the general knowledge of the respondents about epilepsy was assessed by using 10
item checklist which has “Yes”/No choices. For each correct response to questions on
knowledge, one point was given and “Zero” point was given for wrong answers. Based on this
grading, a total of 10 points was allocated to the section on knowledge about epilepsy, such that
those who scored 7–10 points were considered as having Good knowledge, 0-6 points had poor
knowledge.
For internal consistency (reliability) of the knowledge and attitude instrument, Cronbach Alpha
was used and its value was 0.808 and 0.90 respectively.
Operational definitions
Knowledge about epilepsy: - individuals who scored above and below the mean score based on
10 item knowledge tool towards epilepsy was considered as good and poor knowledge
respectively.

Attitude towards epilepsy: - individuals who scored above and below the mean score based on
12 item attitude tool towards epilepsy was considered as favorable and unfavorable attitude
respectively.
2.2. Data analysis
After the data, checked for completeness, and consistencies, then coded, entered, using Epi-data
version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were analyzed
and presented by using tables, charts, and figures. Both Bivariable and multivariable Binary
logistic regression was conducted to identify the associated factors with the outcome variables.
Variables with a p-value less than 0.2 during Bivariable analysis was exported to multivariable
analysis to control confounding effect. Variables with a p-value less than 0.05 and odds ratio
with their 95% confidence interval during multivariable analysis were considered as significantly
associated factors with the outcome variables. Assumption tests and model goodness of fit was
checked and Hosmer Lemeshow test p-value of 0.79.

3. Results
3.1 Socio-demographic characteristics
A total of 606 households were selected for the sample, and 596 were successfully interviewed,
yielding a response rate of 98%. Among the study participants, 332 (55.7%) were males and 264
(44.3%) were females. The median age of the respondents was 30 years and the interquartile
range was 15 years. Among the 596 study participant’s majority 470(78.9%) were orthodox
religion followers followed by 81(13.6%) Muslim and 45 (7.6%) protestant. Majority of the
respondent 494(82.9%) were Amhara ethnicity followed by Oromo which accounts for
67(11.2%). Regarding the income of the respondents near to half 270 (45.3%) had a monthly
income of >3000 followed by those whose monthly income is between 1000 & 2999 and < 1000
which accounts 243 (40.8%) and 83 (13.9%) respectively. Among the total participants, more
than half 333 (55.9%) were married whereas the other 263 (44.1%) were single. Majority 445
(74.7%) of the respondent had a family size 1-3 followed by those whose family members were
4-5 136 (22.8%) (See table 1).

3.2. Information, Experience and Health facility-related factors
The majority of the respondents 546 (91.6%) had heard of epilepsy as a disorder. The
commonest sources of information about epilepsy were from their family or friends 305(55.9%)
while the rest were through radio/magazines, TV/training and health professionals which account
92 (16.8%), 85 (15.6%) and 64 (11.7%) respectively. Majority 475 (79.7%) of the respondents
had witnessed a seizure in the past but only 151(25.3%) and 46(7.7%) had a friend and a family
member with epilepsy respectively. Among our study participants, all 596(100%) have health
facility near to their home and the majority 483(81%) takes less than 30 minutes whereas
113(19%) takes 31-60 minutes.
3.3 Magnitude of knowledge/ attitude towards epilepsy
3.3.1 Magnitude of poor knowledge
Among our study participants near to half 43.6 (95% CI: 39.6, 47.5) had poor knowledge about
epilepsy. This study shows that 192 (32.2%) of the study participants reported seizure attacks
didn’t originate from the brain, caused by evil spirit 278 (46.6%), and infection or injury can’t
cause a seizure disorder 310 (52%). Among the study participants 27%, 42.3% and 39.5% of the
respondents said epilepsy is contagious, traditional medicine is best for the treatment of epilepsy
and wouldn’t mind their child to play with an epileptic child. Almost 17% of the study
participants thought all children with convulsion have a seizure disorder. 177 (29.7%) thoughts
seizure disorders occur in family, 176 (29.5%) did not know about the presence of different types
of seizure disorder, 203 (34.1%) thought there is no medical test for diagnosing seizure disorder,
and 216 (36.2%) reported Seizure disorder can be controlled with modern medicine.
3.3.2 Magnitude of unfavorable attitude
In this study, of 596 participants near to half 41.3 (95% CI: 37.4, 45.1) had an unfavorable
attitude towards epilepsy. Who didn’t agree their family members to marry epileptics accounts
126 (21.1%), didn’t agree to recruit epileptics 105 (17.6%), keep their child from contacting
epileptics (95 (15.9%) and didn’t agree to live together with epileptics 91 (15.3%) (See table 3).

3.4.1 Associated factors of poor knowledge
To determine factors associated with the knowledge about epilepsy, binary logistic regression
was done and computed with each independent variable. In Binary logistic regression,
respondent’s age, marital status, educational status, occupation, income, family role, witnessed a
seizure and heard the term epilepsy in the past were the variables that showed statistically
significant association with the outcome variable that is knowledge about epilepsy. In
multivariate analysis; educational status, marital status, witnessed a seizure, and heard the term
epilepsy in the past was the variables that showed statistically significant association with the
outcome variable that is knowledge about epilepsy. Respondents who didn’t attend modern
education and those who completed secondary education were around 4 times (AOR=3.74, 95%
CI: 1.80, 7.70) and 2 times (AOR=2.13, 95% CI: 1.27, 3.59) more likely to have poor knowledge
than those who completed grade 12 respectively. Those participants who were married were 2

times more likely to have poor knowledge (AOR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.20, 3.21) than those who were
single. Those who didn’t witness seizure were 2 times more likely to have poor knowledge
(AOR=1.79, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.90) than those who witnessed seizure in the past. A respondent
who hadn’t heard the term epilepsy through different mass media or training was around 3 times
more likely to have poor knowledge (AOR=2.67 95% CI: 1.27, 5.59) than those who had heard
about epilepsy (see table 4).

3.4.2 Associated factors of unfavorable Attitude towards people living with epilepsy
The following factors were found to be significantly associated with the attitude towards
epilepsy in bivariate analysis respondent’s sex, age, monthly income, educational status, marital
status, family role, occupation, whether they had witnessed seizure, whether they had a family
member with epilepsy, whether they had a friend with epilepsy, whether they had heard about
epilepsy and the distance of their home from a health institution.
In multivariate analysis; educational status, average monthly income, walking time from home to
the health institution, witnessed a seizure, and heard the term epilepsy in the past was the
variables that showed statistically significant association with the outcome variable that is
knowledge about epilepsy. Respondents who earn less than 1000 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) were 2.5
times higher in odds to have unfavorable attitude than those respondents who earn average
monthly income greater than 3000, (AOR=2.52, 95%CI: 1.34, 4.7). Those respondents with who
were not attending modern education were 2 times more likely to have an unfavorable attitude
(AOR=2.1, 95%CI: 1.10, 4.44) than those who completed grade 12.
There was also a significant association between level of attitude and whether the respondent has
witnessed seizure or not; those respondent who was not witnessed seizure were 2 times likely to
have unfavorable attitude than those who had witnessed a seizure, (AOR= 2.27, 95%CI: 1.35,
3.80). A respondent who did not hear the term epilepsy through different mass media or training
were 5 times more likely to have unfavorable attitude than those who had heard information
about epilepsy, (AOR=4.73 95%CI: 2.04, 11.00). Further, those respondents who lived far from
health institutions (>30 minutes on foot walk) were 2 times more likely to have unfavorable
attitude than respondents who lived in near to health institution (AOR=1.77, 95%CI: 1.06, 2.79)
(see table 5).

4. Discussion
According to the result of this study, 43.6% (95% CI: 39.6, 47.5) of the respondent had poor
general knowledge and 41.3% (95%CI: 37.4, 45.1) had an unfavorable attitude towards epilepsy.
Being secondary education, marital status witnessed a seizure and heard the term epilepsy were
showed statistically significant association with poor knowledge about epilepsy. Level of
education, low average monthly income, not witnessed a seizure, not heard the term epilepsy and
distant from health facility showed statically significant association with the unfavorable attitude.
The overall poor knowledge magnitude was in line with the study conducted in Ethiopia (20, 23).
But it is much lower than studies done in southwest Ethiopia (21) and united states (19). This
might be due to the study year. The study from the United States was done in 2003 and the study
done in Ethiopia was during 2015.
Regarding the attitude towards epilepsy in our study, 41.3 (95%CI: 37.4, 45.1) of the respondent
had an unfavorable attitude towards epilepsy. This study result is in line with the study done in
south India (11).but, this finding is lower than the study conducted in Ethiopia(21, 23), Uganda
(24), Nigeria (25) and Pakistan (26). This might be a difference in community belief and literacy
rate across the countries.
But, the current study results are higher than the study conducted in south Indian (11); this may
be due to in this study area more than half of the respondents had experience about epilepsy so
those individuals may have a favorable attitude. Negative attitudes appeared to be reinforced by
beliefs that epilepsy is a kind of insanity.
This study shows that respondents who didn’t attend modern education and those who were
primary/secondary education were around 4 times and 2 times more likely to have poor
knowledge than those who completed grade 12; this finding is in line with the study conducted in
Ethiopia, the United States and Ghana (11, 23, 27). The possible justification may be individuals

in higher education may expose more to epilepsy awareness creation sessions. In fact, it is
expected to have knowledge change while academic status increased.

The result reveals respondents who hadn’t heard the term epilepsy through different mass media
or training were around 3 times more likely to have poor knowledge than those who had heard
information about epilepsy; this finding is in line with the study conducted in Ethiopia (23).
Hearing the term epilepsy may invite individuals to ask/read about epilepsy and this allows to
have good knowledge.
This study shows that those respondents who did not hear the term epilepsy through different
mass media or training were 5 times more likely to have unfavorable attitude than those who
had heard information about epilepsy; this result is in line with the study conducted in Ethiopia,
which shows respondents who had heard information about epilepsy had favorable attitude
compared with those who had not had information about epilepsy(23). This might be due to mass
Media and training are the main strategies to change people’s attitude towards persons with
epilepsy.
Study participants who earn less than 1000 Ethiopian birr were more likely to have unfavorable
attitude than who earn greater than 3000 Ethiopian birrs per month. The possible reason might be
due to having more monthly income associated with higher in participants’ educational level and
this implies, they became employed. Living far from the health institution was also a contributor
for having an unfavorable attitude and this might be due to decreased exposure level for health
issues like epilepsy.
5. Conclusions
In this study, Debre Berhan communities were found to have deficits in terms of general
knowledge and attitude about epilepsy. The knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy are likely
to have an important impact on stigmatization and treatment-seeking behavior, and it should be
given due attention. Lower educational status, those who didn’t witness seizure and hadn’t heard
information were related to poor knowledge. Low level of income, those who didn’t witness a
