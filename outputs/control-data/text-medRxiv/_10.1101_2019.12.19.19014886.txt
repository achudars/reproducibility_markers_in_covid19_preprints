Abstract

This pilot study examines effectiveness of an innovative pharmacy design change on overthe-counter (OTC) medication misuse in older adults (ages ≥65). Few interventions have attempted to
decrease older adult OTC misuse, and none have addressed system barriers. A structural redesign of the
pharmacy (the Senior SectionTM) was conceptualized to increase awareness of higher-risk OTC
medications. The Senior Section contains a curated selection of OTC medications (for pain, cough/cold,
allergy, sleep) and is close to the prescription department to facilitate pharmacy staff/patient
engagement to reduce misuse.
Objectives:

A pre-/post-implementation design was used to recruit 87 older adults from three
pharmacies. Using a hypothetical scenario, participants selected an OTC medication, which was
compared to their medication list and health conditions, and their reported use was compared against
the product labeling. Four misuse outcomes were determined: (1) Drug/Drug, (2) Drug/Disease, (3)
Drug/Age, and (4) Drug/Label with five sub-types. Patient characteristics were collected and compiled
into a propensity-score matching logistic regression model to estimate their effects on the Senior
Section’s association with misuse outcomes at pre-/post-implementation.
Methods:

Patient characteristic were uniform between pre-/post-implementation and, once entered into
a propensity-score matching model, Drug/Disease Misuse significantly lessened over time (z=-2.09,
p=0.037). The Senior Section reduced Drug/Drug Misuse, but not significantly. Drug/Label Misuse
varied according to the sub-type, with reduced Daily-Dosage (z=-2.42, p=0.016) and Single-Dosage
misuse (z=-5.82, p=0.001); however, Timing/Frequency misuse increased (z=2.16, p=0.031).
Results:

These nascent outcomes support a well-conceived pharmacy-based OTC aisles redesign as
valuable for reducing older adult OTC medication misuse. The Senior Section, when broadly
implemented, would create new permanent structures and processes to assist older adults in accessing
risk information for confidently selecting safer OTC medications.
Conclusions:

Introduction

Over the last 15 years, there has been increasing interest in investigating and mitigating the
prevalent problem of misuse of over-the-counter (OTC) medications.1-7 The accumulating body of
empirical evidence gained from directly investigating OTC misuse coincided with published literature
estimating the extent of adverse events among older adults while examining the general incidence of
OTC use (see 8-9 for example). Assessments of national data indicate that older adults who report that
they are currently taking OTC medications are susceptible to using those medications unsafely. For
example, while over a third of older adults take at least one OTC medication, more than two-thirds of
those concurrently use OTC medications with prescription medications or dietary supplements, which
creates a potential for adverse medication interactions.10 In addition, OTC-related adverse drug events
continue to be implicated in emergency hospitalizations involving older adults.9 In many cases, these
undesirable health consequences represent an unanticipated consequence of patients’ polypharmacy.11
Harms resulting from OTC-related adverse events are often a function of medication misuse,
which is uniquely high for the older adult population due to a variety of factors – including increased
risks related to certain medications based on a person’s age (representing Drug/Age misuse),
interactions with concurrent medications (representing Drug/Drug misuse), exacerbation of current
health conditions (representing Drug/Disease misuse), and deviations from recommended usage
instructions (representing Drug/Label misuse).7,12 Although these situations are possible to identify and
address within a primary care setting, practitioners often remain unaware of their patients’ OTC
medication use.1,13 To further complicate matters, patients frequently lack knowledge about the safety
issues associated with the OTC medications that they choose to take without guidance from a
healthcare professional,14-16 although recent evidence relating to patients in the U.S. is scarce.
Despite the decades-long availability of published resources such as the Beers Criteria,17-22
prevention of misuse within the older adult population can be undermined by the types of both health

professional and patient issues discussed above. This evidence suggest that practice-based
interventions can be an important method in which to reduce the potential for patient harms through
the inappropriate use of OTC medications. Unfortunately, clinical practice and research has not
traditionally generated testable practice design interventions to address system barriers for decreasing
misuse of high-risk OTC medications in older adults.

TM
The Senior Section

To meet this need, the frameworks of participatory design23 and human factors engineering24
were used to redesign a structural layout of the pharmacy (as described in the study protocol12).
Community pharmacies were considered an ideal system in which to implement an intervention in an
attempt to prevent misuse, given their prominence in the community as an easily-accessible source of
OTC medications coupled with pharmacists’ professional training and experience in medication safety.
The re-designed structural layout (called the Senior Section) aimed to increase awareness of higher-risk
OTC medications, and to promote interactions between pharmacy staff and older adults that would
promote safer OTC medication decisions. The Senior Section contains a specialized, curated, layout for
OTC medication categories (for pain, cough/cold, allergy, sleep) with lower risk profiles, displays signage
showing medication safety warnings, and is close to the prescription department to facilitate pharmacy
staff/patient engagement. A fundamental hypothesis of this intervention is that older adult patients
who gain insights into potential OTC medication safety issues, either through interactions with
pharmacy staff or by following cautionary signage content, will be less likely to misuse OTC medications
and thus be at reduced risk of use-related harms.

This pilot study was designed to examine the effects of an innovative pharmacy design change
on the reported misuse of OTC medications by older adults. Two research questions guided this study:
(1) Did implementing the Senior Section in a small sample of community pharmacies reduce occurrence
of Drug/Age, Drug/Drug, Drug/Disease, and Drug/Label misuse, and (2) Did various patient
characteristics influence the Senior Section’s effect on these misuse outcomes? It was hypothesized
that innovation implementation would decrease the frequency of OTC medication misuse, and that
patient characteristics had the potential to moderate this effect.

Methods

A pre-/post-implementation design was used to assess changes in the occurrence of misuse for
older adults recruited from a small sample of community pharmacies within a single pharmacy
organization.

Recruitment

Three community pharmacies from the same pharmacy chain were selected for project
participation. Each pharmacy location generated a list of customers who were 65 years or older and
received a prescription from that pharmacy within the last year. Older adults received an invitation
letter to participate in the study, sent from the pharmacy manager at each site, explaining that the store
was collaborating with University of Wisconsin researchers to learn more about how older adults select
and use OTC medications. The letter stated that eligible participants were within a certain age category
and had either purchased or considered purchasing an OTC medication in the past year to treat either
pain, insomnia/sleep problem, cough/cold, or allergies. A decision was made to include all communitydwelling older adults, regardless of their cognitive capacity. Although a range of cognitive capacity could

be expected, exclusions were not made because all non-institutionalized individuals comprise the OTC
medication-purchasing population.
A cumulative total of 1350 letters were mailed to eligible participants during the preimplementation phase, while 450 were mailed to different participants during the post-implementation
phase. Study fliers also were placed near the pick-up window at each pharmacy. Both letters and fliers
contained instructions for potential participants to contact the study team to learn more about the
study. Pharmacy staff could also call the study team with contact information for potential participants,
if that older adult preferred to be contacted directly. Interested participants were then phoned to be
given information about the study requirements and, if desired, a date and time was scheduled to
complete an interview at the pharmacy location at which they were a regular customer. Study materials
were mailed prior to the interview. Participants were paid $20 for completing the study. This
recruitment method resulted in the selection of two separate cohorts – one for pre-implementation and
one for post-implementation. Recruitment occurred from March to September 2018. This study is a
component of a larger research project that was approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional
Review Board.
Post-implementation recruitment and patient participation was severely hampered by the
unanticipated and rapid closure of the pharmacy chain, which occurred during the project timeframe.
Although an effort was made to accelerate recruitment efforts after the closure was announced, there
was insufficient time to accumulate the anticipated number of completed patient interviews. As a
result, the post-implementation sample size was lower than originally predicted, resulting in notably
unequal sample sizes between time periods. The Statistical Analysis section below outlines the
approach taken to ensure appropriate statistical comparisons of these disparate sample sizes.

Participants completed one pharmacy-based interview and two questionnaires. Prior to the
interview, participants were mailed a questionnaire that assessed nine patient characteristics – health
status (Likert scale, 1=poor, 5=excellent), health conditions (the Older Americans Resource Survey
methodology), 30-day medication use (self-reported for prescriptions, OTCs, and dietary/herbal
supplements), number of prescribers and pharmacies (self-reported), age, gender, education, and race.
Participants brought the completed questionnaire with them to their scheduled interview. All
participants (either pre- or post-implementation) completed the same data collection tools.
Participants were met by the interviewer near the store entrance. After collecting study
materials and answering any participant questions, the participant was asked to choose one of the
following symptom scenarios that applied to them:

Scenario 1: Sleep
Recently, you have been having (more) difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. You are here at
[name of store] to look for a medication that can help you sleep.

Scenario 2: Pain
You are having a soreness and muscle aches. It is not bad enough to call your doctor. You have
not taken any medication to help with these aches yet. You are here at [name of store] to look
for a medication that can help you feel better.

Scenario 3: Cough/Cold or Allergy
For the past three days you’ve had a runny nose, sore throat, felt “stuffy”, and your head is
congested. You don’t have a fever and it is not bad enough to call your doctor. You have not
taken any medication for your symptoms yet, but you are here at [name of store] to look for a
medication that can help you feel better.

Participants were then asked to show and tell the researcher how they would address the health issue
described in the scenario by walking the interviewer through the store to the medication they would

select. Occasional probes were offered during the interview, which included questions such as “How did
you decide to pick this particular medication?” or “What are you thinking about when you decided to
pick this medication instead of other ones?” After selecting a medication, participants were asked to
describe how they would use the medication they selected, including such questions as “How would you
take this medication? How often? And what time of day?” A short satisfaction survey, assessing
patients’ interactions with pharmacy staff and about their OTC medication selection, was administered
following the interview. Interviews were audio and video recorded and transcribed. On average, the inperson interview took about 30 minutes to complete. All pre- and post-implementation data were
collected between July and December, 2018.

Misuse Analysis

Three pharmacists with clinical experience working with the geriatric population comprised a
misuse analysis team. Prior to the misuse evaluation, information about the participant and OTC
medication selected was de-identified and entered into Redcap. This information included participant’s
self-reported medication list and health conditions, and the selected OTC and reported OTC use (which
included direct portions of the interview transcript and use summaries prepared by the research team).
Data were extracted from the transcripts in this manner to ensure that the misuse analysis team would
be unable to identify whether the interview occurred before or after Senior Section implementation.
Also included were photographs of the OTC medication (front, back, and top to capture all product
labeling information) as reference for the misuse analysis team. A random number generator was
applied to the participant list, which randomly assigned all participants to three different batches for
evaluation. The overall process of randomization and blinding ensured that the misuse analysis team
would be unable to identify whether the interview occurred pre- or post-implementation. Misuse was
first evaluated independently by each reviewer, and responses were then consolidated in preparation

for group discussion and discrepancies between reviewers were noted. The misuse study team,
supported by study researchers (JAS, MAC, and KZX) then met as a group to review independent
comments, facilitate discussion about discrepancies (which were commonly the result of misuse analysis
team members’ interpretation of the drug facts information on the label or what patients meant when
describing their use), and achieve consensus about final misuse classifications.
Four misuse outcomes were operationalized by the misuse analysis team through these group
discussions:
(1) Drug-Age Misuse was identified using the 2015 Beers Criteria list for older adults, where any
selected OTC medication included on the list is considered misuse, except NSAIDs that are only
used to temporarily treat acute pain.
(2) Drug-Drug Misuse was measured using LexiComp risk ratings of medication interactions, and
resulted in the following domains that carried enough risk to be considered misuse:
a. Type C (monitor therapy),
b. Type D (consider therapy modification), and
c. Type X (avoid combination).
(3) Drug-Disease Misuse was determined by identifying potential interactions between medications
and disease states designated as high-risk in Beers Criteria, a condition listed in product labeling,
or other (e.g. clinical knowledge of the pharmacist).
(4) Drug-Label Misuse considers the following deviations from the product labeling
recommendations:
a. over daily dosage,
b. exceeds single dose,
c. dose timing/frequency,
d. use duration, and

e. inappropriate indication.
For Drug-Age, Drug-Disease, and Drug-Label misuse, the final determinations were based on evaluations
and agreement by the misuse analysis team, and was measured as the frequency of misuse per
participant.

Statistical Analysis

Previous sample size power computations estimated a total of 144 different participants (72
older adults at both pre- and post-implementation) were needed to determine changes in OTC
medication misuse.12 However, effect size calculations using the current sample sizes (see Results
section) revealed at least medium effect sizes25 for 7 of the 11 misuse comparisons evaluated at preand post-implementation for this study. This metric suggests that the current overall sample size for this
study is sufficient to warrant the planned use of test statistics.
To estimate binary treatment effects in a non-experimental statistical setting, when units’ nonrandom assignment to treatment is due to selection based on observations, reweighting is a valuable
approach.26 That is, when the treatment is not randomly assigned, it is expected that the treated and
untreated units present very different distributions of their observable characteristics. To account for
this assumption, an initial propensity score was estimated based on the treatment condition using a
Logit model to compute the predicated probability (ߨ ). Using the pi score, the following weights were
constructed: 1/ߨ for the treated observations, and 1/(1-ߨ ) for the untreated observations. It was then
possible to calculate the average treatment effect by comparing the weighted means of the two groups.
All estimates were conducted using the “teffects” and “treatrew” routines in Stata v.16.27 Logistic
regression initially was used to determine similarity of patient characteristics at pre/postimplementation of the Senior Section. These variables were then compiled into a propensity-score

matching model to estimate their combined effects on the Senior Section’s association with various
misuse types.

Results

Findings are based on recruitment rates of 5% at pre-implementation (72/1350) and 3% at postimplementation (15/450), although the post-implementation rate was influenced by store closures. The
status of patient demographic characteristics is provided in Table 1, and revealed few notable
differences in patient samples between pre- and post-implementation. At pre-implementation, no
patient had an educational level below high school, but one patient reported education up to eighth
grade at post-implementation. The number of medications that patients reported taking also was
narrower at post-implementation (pre-implementation min/max: 1-33 vs. post-implementation
min/max: 6-18), but this did not translate into any distinction between means. In addition, over 60% of
patients had a total health rating of very good or excellent prior to Senior Section implementation, while
only a third of patients had the same rating at post-implementation. Despite these slight differences,
Table 2 shows that, when examined individually, no patient characteristic varied significantly between
pre-/post-implementation. Such findings suggest that the patient samples can be considered
homogeneous for these characteristics across the two assessment end-points.
Table 3 demonstrates differences between the means for the various types of misuse before the
Senior Section was implemented compared to post-implementation. For these samples, the means for
OTC medication misuse frequencies tended to be low overall, with only one mean (for Drug/Drug
Misuse-Type C at pre-implementation) approaching 1.50 and most being below 0.50. Seven of the 11
comparisons also showed expected patterns of effects, where the frequency of misuse at postimplementation was lower than at pre-implementation. However, for the four types of misuse with

higher means after intervention implementation, the difference between means was no more than
0.073.
When entering these combined characteristics into a propensity-score matching model,
statistical effects also differed as a function of the type of misuse (see Table 4). Regardless of whether
the patient characteristics propensity score was entered into the model, the Senior Section intervention
did not significantly change either Drug/Age Misuse or the three elements of Drug/Drug Misuse (C, D,
and X), although there were fewer instances of most of these behaviors at post-implementation. As
such, the cumulative covariates had little if any adjusting effect on those outcomes. Alternatively,
instances of Drug/Disease Misuse significantly lessened over time only when considering the influence
of the patient characteristics (z=-2.09, p=0.037).
For Drug/Label Misuse, the Senior Section’s influence seemed to vary according to the sub-type,
with Daily-Dosage Misuse achieving significant reductions only with the patient characteristics
accounted for in the model (z=-2.42, p=0.016). Single-Dosage Misuse decreased after the intervention,
as represented in both regression models (without propensity score: z=-6.38, p=0.001; with propensity
score: z=-5.82, p=0.001). However, when the effects of patient characteristics were added as a
propensity score, Timing/Frequency Misuse became significantly more frequent at post-implementation
(z=2.16, p=0.031). Exceeding medication use duration or using medication for an inappropriate
indication were only slightly more frequent at post-implementation, but this pattern of effect changed
for Inappropriate Indication Misuse when the propensity score was introduced to the model.

Discussion

Results suggest that a simple but well-conceived redesign of the OTC aisles in a small number of
community pharmacies can reduce some categories of older adult OTC medication misuse. Comparing
data from homogenous samples over time, these analyses suggest that the Senior Section influenced

the frequency of misuse, with the degree of change depending on the specific type of misuse and
patient characteristic effects. The two misuse categories that seemed most responsive to the system
redesign were Drug/Disease Misuse and Drug/Label Misuse. Drug/Disease Misuse, Drug/Label Misuse
(Exceeds Daily-Dosage), and Drug/Label Misuse (Exceeds Timing/Frequency) became significant only
after the patient demographic covariate was added to the models; the covariates comprising the patient
demographic propensity score had an adjusting impact, making the effect of the intervention more
sensitive. However, the occurrence of Drug/Label Misuse (Exceeds Timing/Frequency) challenged
expectations by being reported more frequently after the Senior Section was implemented. Despite this
single significant finding, almost 70% of all misuse comparisons (from all models, either excluding and
including the propensity score) were trending in the direction of anticipated effects, with lower
frequencies occurring at post-implementation.
Although it was originally hypothesized that the Senior Section would have a notable
diminishing effect on all types of misuse, in retrospect there are clear reasons that may argue against
the validity of this expectation. Drug/Age Misuse, based on the Beers Criteria list, likely did not change
statistically because of two factors. First, ibuprofen remained in the Senior Section inventory because of
its benefits for treating a variety of symptoms, even though the Beers Criteria contains a
recommendation to avoid its chronic use for pain management. Second, it was often difficult to
ascertain when this misuse type was occurring, because a determination was frequently needed to be
made between a patient’s acute and chronic use. Alternatively, for Drug/Drug Misuse, the cautionary
signage contained in the Senior Section did not include warnings about specific drugs or about
potentials for interactions. When expanding implementation of the Senior Section into a broader
network of pharmacies, which is being planned, modifications will be necessary to determine the best
approach to address a greater variety of misuse types.

Overall, these were encouraging patterns of effects, and were demonstrated even given the
relatively small post-implementation sample size. This intervention, if more broadly implemented in
other pharmacy corporations, would create new permanent structures and processes that could
improve the quality and availability of information for older adults as they approach the OTC aisles.
Such information could lead to greater risk awareness, and help older adults more easily determine their
own risk levels and to select safer OTC medications with confidence. Further research must evaluate the
generalizability of the intervention’s results and the sustainability of post-implementation
improvements in different pharmacy environments. Physically redesigning OTC aisles may also be
tested in different vulnerable populations, such as pediatric patients. Taken together, these preliminary
outcomes support the Senior Section as a valuable tool for pharmacy staff to improve patients’ safe OTC
medication use through heightened awareness and education efforts.

Strengths & Limitation

The principal strength of this pilot study was its innovation. It was the first to empirically evaluate
implementation of a pharmacy redesign intervention on the prevalence of the reported misuse of OTC
medications in homogenous samples of older adults, as well as evaluating OTC selection and use within
a naturalistic setting.
Despite the crucial insights gained from this analysis, a various limitations warrant consideration
beyond the limited generalizability of this small sample of community pharmacies. First, a number of
patient characteristics were self-reported (e.g., health status, 30-day medication use, and number of
prescribers and pharmacies seen), so future data collection efforts should attempt to employ existing
health systems databases. Second, although the patient sample size was limited (n=87 cumulatively
between pre- and post-implementation). However, the statistical approach was chosen specifically to
best accommodate this sample size and compute valid results. Third, throughout this study, patients

were not randomly selected but rather were chosen through recruitment methods. Fourth, patient
interview responses were based on reactions to a hypothetical health scenario and may not represent
“real world” behaviors. Fifth, results could vary based on which scenario the participant selected (i.e.,
pain, cough/cold, allergy, or sleep). Additional research is necessary on a larger selection of participants
to determine the influence of medication category on types of misuse. Finally, as mentioned previously,
the Senior Section may not be designed sufficiently to address certain types of misuse, such as
Drug/Drug Misuse and Drug/Age Misuse, and future research should consider the intervention features
constructed specifically to reduce a broader array of misuse.

Conclusions

This pilot study provides initial insights into the extent that a pharmacy system redesign reduced
potential patient uses of OTC medications that were indicative of misuse (e.g., selecting an OTC that was
contraindicated with existing health conditions or that differed from product labeling). That is,
increased opportunities for pharmacy staff to engage with patients around medication safety issues,
along with more visible cautionary signage and an OTC inventory comprising lower-risk medications
when used to treat particular symptoms, generally decreased the occurrences of types of misuse to
varying degrees. However, implementation of the intervention in more and different pharmacies, as
well as assessing its impact on a greater number of patients, is warranted before the Senior Section can
be considered a translatable and broadly valuable approach. As it now stands, the Senior Section
represents a promising approach to enhance patients’ awareness of OTC risks and promote safe use of
these medications through timesaving and effective pharmacy staff/patient interactions28-29 – a method
that this research team is committed to continually evaluating and refining to achieve more universal
application and sustained positive effect.
