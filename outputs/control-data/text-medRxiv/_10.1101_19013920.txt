Abstract
Background: Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy have
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Integration of services for hypertension
(HTN), the primary CVD risk factor, into HIV clinics is recommended in Uganda. Our prior
work demonstrated multiple gaps in implementation of integrated HTN care along the HIV
treatment cascade. In this study, we sought to explore barriers to, and facilitators of, integrating
HTN screening and treatment into HIV clinics in Eastern Uganda.
Methods: We conducted a qualitative study at three HIV clinics with low, intermediate, and
high HTN care cascade performance, which we classified based on our prior work. Guided by
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we conducted semistructured interviews with health services managers, health care providers and hypertensive
PLHIV (n=83). Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Three qualitative researchers used both
deductive (CFIR model-driven) and inductive (open coding) methods to develop relevant codes
and themes. Ratings were performed to determine valence and strengths of each CFIR construct
regarding influencing HTN/HIV integration.
Results: Of the 39 CFIR constructs assessed, 17 were relevant to either barriers or facilitators
to HTN/HIV integration. Six constructs strongly distinguished performance and were barriers,
three of which were in the Inner setting (Organizational Incentives & Rewards, Available
Resources, Access to Knowledge & Information); two in Characteristics of individuals
(Knowledge & Beliefs about the Intervention and Self-efficacy) and one in Intervention
characteristics (Design Quality & Packaging). Four additional constructs were weakly
distinguishing and negatively influenced HTN/HIV integration. There were four facilitators for
HTN/HIV integration related to the intervention (Relative advantage, Adaptability,
Complexity and Compatibility). The remaining four constructs negatively influenced
HTN/HIV integration but were non-distinguishing.
Conclusion: Using the CFIR, we have shown that while there are modifiable barriers to
HTN/HIV integration in the Inner setting, Outer setting, Characteristics of individuals and
implementation Process, HTN/HIV integration is of interest to patients, health care providers
and managers. Improving access to HTN care among PLHIV will require overcoming barriers
and capitalizing on the facilitators using a health system strengthening approach. These
findings are a springboard for designing contextually appropriate interventions for HTN/HIV
integration in low- and middle-income countries.

The barriers and facilitators identified are a basis for designing contextualized

87

Background

88

Persons living with HIV (PLHIV) and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at increased

89

risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to ART, HIV infection itself, aging, chronic

90

inflammation, and immune reconstitution [1-3]. In Uganda, approximately 1/3 of PLHIV aged

91

≥18 years have hypertension (HTN), the leading cause of CVD and preventable mortality [4-

92

12]. PLHIV with HTN have an increased risk of mortality compared to HIV negative persons

93

[13].

94

The World Health Organization (WHO) and Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) consolidated

95

guidelines for HIV Care and Treatment recommend that all PLHIV should be screened for

96

HTN at every visit to the HIV clinic. PLHIV who are diagnosed with HTN should receive

97

treatment for both HIV and HTN as integrated services [14, 15]. HTN/HIV integration provides

98

patient-centred care compared with vertical programs and increases efficiency, by eliminating

99

fragmentation and duplication of services [16]. However, there is little empiric evidence

100

describing implementation of this policy in Uganda.

101

HTN/HIV integration has been attempted in Uganda and Malawi by the SEARCH trial and the

102

Lighthouse Trust program, respectively. However, although HTN screening was achieved for

103

all patients in the HIV clinics under these programs, control of HTN among PLHIV who

104

received antihypertensive medication remained suboptimal at about 30% [5, 17].

105

We recently conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1649 newly enrolled PLHIV. We

106

mapped the parallel care cascades for HTN and HIV within three high volume HIV clinics

107

(average 3600 PLHIV) in Eastern Uganda and demonstrated suboptimal HTN screening, one

108

year retention in HTN care, and HTN control of 27%, 57% and 24% respectively among

109

PLHIV within a successful HIV program that has achieved the two of three UNAIDS 90-90-

110

90 goals [18]. As a follow-up to that study, the present qualitative study sought to determine

111

barriers to, and facilitators of, integrating screening and treatment of HTN into HIV clinics in

112

Eastern Uganda. Understanding the barriers and facilitators would inform the design of

113

contextually appropriate implementation interventions for HTN/HIV integration in Uganda.

114

Methods

115

Study design

116

Using data from our previous retrospective cohort study, we graded HTN care cascade

117

performance among the three HIV clinics as high, intermediate and low according to

118

achievement in screening, diagnosis, initiation of treatment, retention, monitoring and control.

119

We conducted key informant interviews (KIIs) with the district health officer (DHO), each

120

health facility manager (n=3), lead nurse at each HIV clinic (n=3), the lead clinicians at

121

Nagongera and Mulanda HIV clinics (n=2), and two clinicians at TASO Tororo. Additionally,

122

to obtain patients’ information about integrated HTN/HIV services, we conducted focus group

123

discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with hypertensive PLHIV at each HIV

124

clinic.

125

We utilized the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to explore

126

barriers to, and facilitators of, HTN/HIV integration [18]. CFIR provides a pragmatic structure

127

for identifying potential influences on implementation of interventions in health systems at

128

multiple levels [19, 20]. CFIR organizes conceptual elements across theories and disciplines

129

into 39 constructs which are then organized in five key domains. All constructs interact to affect

130

the process and effectiveness of implementation [21]. CFIR’s five major domains include:

131

Intervention characteristics, Outer setting, Inner setting, Characteristics of individuals, and

132

Implementation Process [22]. (Figure 1). Barriers to, and facilitators of, HTN/HIV integration

133

(Intervention) were compared across the three HIV clinics to understand the strength of their

134

influence on HTN screening and treatment among PLHIV.

135

Study setting

136

We conducted this study at three HIV clinics (The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) Tororo,

137

Nagongera Health Centre IV and Mulanda Health Center IV) and the District Health Office of

138

Tororo District, Eastern Uganda.

139

The Ugandan public-sector healthcare system is hierarchical in nature and comprises the

140

national (Ministry of Health [MoH]), sub-national (Regional), district, health facility and

141

community levels. MoH develops guidelines for health services and rolls them out through the

142

regions to the districts. The District Health Team (DHT) leads and coordinates guideline

143

implementation at health facilities.

144

HIV clinics are the designated treatment centers for HIV, HIV-associated opportunistic

145

infections and other HIV-associated co-morbidities. They are physically situated as outpatient

146

departments within health centers and hospitals. We selected these three HIV clinics because

147

they are the largest in Tororo district, providing care to approximately 7500, 1400, and 1100

148

PLHIV, respectively. They are housed within public health facilities with support from both

149

the Government of Uganda and the President’s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).

150

The clinics are staffed by various cadres of health workers including clinicians, nurses,

151

midwives, and HIV peer counsellors. Each HIV clinic offers a full spectrum of HIV services

152

including screening, ART, viral load testing, as well as screening for and treating opportunistic

153

infections. Each also has the mandate to screen for, and manage NCDs such as HTN and

154

diabetes. Based on existing processes in place at the time of data collection, within a given

155

clinical encounter, BP is measured by the clinician at his/her discretion [18]. If a patient is

156

diagnosed with HTN (by measurement or previous history), the clinician typically prescribes

157

both ART and antihypertensive medicine simultaneously and the client is given one follow-up

158

appointment for both conditions. All medicines at facility pharmacies are obtained from the

159

centralized National Medical Stores (NMS). PEPFAR provides funds to NMS to procure

160

medicines specifically for HIV and opportunistic infections. Medicines for HTN and other

161

NCDs are procured on request by the health facilities via general funds allocated to each health

162

facility by MoH. If medicines are out of stock at the facility pharmacy, the patient is advised

163

to purchase them from a private sector pharmacy of the patient’s choice.

164

Clinic providers are routinely oriented to national HIV treatment guidelines which recommend

165

screening for NCDs and their risk factors. In addition, clinical support discussions about

166

challenging HIV/NCD cases were also used to build capacity for NCD/HIV integration among

167

clinicians.

168

Study participants and Sampling

169

We interviewed purposively selected healthcare providers and patients living with both HIV

170

and HTN. Eligible healthcare care providers were individuals who had responsibility to treat

171

patients in the HIV clinics or leadership roles at the respective health facilities or at the district

172

health office. These health care providers were knowledgeable about and actively involved in

173

HIV service delivery at their clinics or at the district health office. Eligible patients were PLHIV

174

with hypertension attending one of the three HIV clinics. Patients with a mental disability were

175

excluded.

176

Data collection

177

We used semi-structured interview guides developed based on the five domains of CFIR [19].

178

The interviews had open ended questions reflecting patient, provider and health care managers’

179

perspectives and perceptions about HTN/HIV integration. Prior to data collection, we pretested

180

the interview guides with health care providers and hypertensive PLHIV at TASO Tororo who

181

were not participating in the study. We conducted six FGDs (two per HIV clinic) with patients

182

in each group consisting of ten hypertensive PLHIV. We conducted twelve IDIs with

183

hypertensive PLHIV, four at each HIV clinic and eleven KIIs. We used patient IDIs to obtain

184

individual lived experiences, while FGDs explored shared experiences among hypertensive

185

PLHIV.

186

Data analysis

187

Qualitative data coding

188

After transcribing, a research team with expertise in social sciences, public health and clinical

189

care was established comprising three members (AKT, DBN, RN), who conducted thematic

190

content analysis. The team coded transcripts using both deductive (guided by CFIR as a coding

191

framework) and inductive (through open coding to obtain new themes that may arise)

192

approaches. The coding process was guided by the consensual qualitative research (CQR)

193

procedure [23].

194

First, each research team member read three transcripts independently and identified

195

preliminary codes. Through a series of meetings, discussing coding differences, an initial

196

codebook was agreed upon. To organize and manage the large amount of data, all transcripts

197

were then coded utilizing Atlas.ti (version 7) software while applying the codebook and giving

198

an allowance for new codes. An external researcher independently coded six of the transcripts

199

to establish inter coder reliability (Kappa 0.80). A final codebook and subthemes were resolved

200

by the researchers through more meetings and these were mapped to the CFIR domains and

201

constructs (Table 3).

203

Defining unit of analysis and performance criteria

204

The three clinics were our units of analysis. We used data from our recent retrospective cohort

205

study [18] which assessed performance of each HIV clinic across HTN care cascade steps

206

including: Screening, Diagnosis, Initiation of Treatment, Retention into care, Monitoring and

207

BP Control (This assessment is also highlighted in figure 2). Generally, the most significant

208

care gaps were identified in Screening and BP control[18]. Basing on the cascade performance

209

reported, we classified the three HIV clinics as high, intermediate, or low performing. (Figure

210

2).

211

Rating the CFIR constructs and interpretation

212

Ratings were performed to determine valence, which assesses whether the construct had a

213

positive, neutral, or negative influence on implementation of integrated HTN/HIV care, and

214

strength which is the degree of its influence. The coded text was then subjected to a rating

215

process based on criteria shown in Table 1 [24]. We used a consensus process to assign a rating

216

to each construct obtained from each site based on the coded text. We based the rating of

217

constructs on the level of agreement among study participants interviewed, strength of

218

language, and use of concrete examples to emphasize responses (Table 1). Positive influence

219

indicated a facilitator of HTN/HIV integration while negative influence indicated a barrier.

220

After rating all constructs obtained from the three HIV clinics, we developed a matrix that

221

listed the ratings for the CFIR construct for each of the clinics. We then focused our analysis

222

on discerning patterns across the three HIV clinics. Using relative rating, but not absolute

223

figures, we compared ratings across the HIV clinics and determined which constructs

224

distinguished performance, either strongly or weakly, or did not distinguish but influenced

225

performance either negatively or positively. Complexity was ‘reverse rated’ to be consistent

226

with the other constructs; i.e., a positive sign denotes perception of simplicity and a negative

227

sign denotes complexity in implementation [22, 24, 25]. (Table 3). We extracted specific

228

quotations from the transcripts illustrating verbatim expressions of matters that appeared

229

important. We followed the StaRI checklist in developing the manuscript [26].

230

Results

231

TASO Tororo was the highest performing for all the six cascade steps. Mulanda HC IV was

232

intermediate for screening, diagnosis, initiation of treatment, and control but lowest for

233

retention and monitoring. Nagongera HC IV was the lowest for all the six cascade steps having

234

achieved the same with Mulanda HC IV in retention and monitoring. (Figure 2).

235

Apart from the DHT member, the male to female ratios of participants were 1:1 in all FGDs,

236

IDIs and KIIs. (Table 2).

237

Of the 39 CFIR constructs assessed, 17 were relevant to either barriers or facilitators to

238

HTN/HIV integration. We found six constructs which strongly distinguished performance,

239

three of which were in the Inner setting (Organizational Incentives & Rewards, Available

240

Resources, and Access to Knowledge & Information); two in Characteristics of individuals

241

(Knowledge & Beliefs about the Intervention and Self-efficacy) and one in Intervention

242

characteristics (Design Quality & Packaging). Four additional constructs distinguished

243

performance weakly. All ten distinguishing constructs negatively influenced HTN/HIV

244

integration. There were four constructs [Relative advantage, Adaptability, the simplicity (non-

245

complex nature) of the intervention and Compatibility] which had positive influence for

246

HTN/HIV integration at all the three HIV clinics but did not distinguish performance. These

247

four factors related to the intervention are the key facilitators for HTN/HIV integration. The

248

remaining three constructs negatively influenced HTN/HIV integration but were non-

249

distinguishing. (Table 3). Below, we present the detailed results in the context of the five CFIR

250

domains.

252

Intervention Characteristics

253

Relative advantage was not a distinguishing construct. Healthcare providers at all three HIV

254

clinics perceived HTN/HIV integration as a relative advantage and more effective compared

255

to alternative modes of care for hypertensive PLHIV. Health care providers noted that

256

integrated HTN/HIV was less time consuming since patients received care for both HTN and

257

HIV in the same clinic on the same appointment date, hence reducing costs on transport and

258

improving retention.

259

“It is extremely important because if I were a patient having two chronic conditions, I would

260

not want to spend my time going to a hospital for condition A and then go to another for

261

condition B. HIV clinics should be a one-stop centre for our patients so that when they come

262

for ART, they get other drugs at one point so it minimizes the movement. It is extremely

263

important to integrate; it helps to reduce the loss to turn up because you give the patient same

264

appointment. The appointment they are supposed to come for their ARVs is the same day they

265

are supposed to come for their check-up and refills of hypertension medicines: this saves time

266

on the side of clients.” (KII, health facility manager HIV clinic C)

267

Similarly, adaptability was not a distinguishing construct since respondents at all the clinics

268

perceived that HTN/HIV integration fits within their routine care provision. This was another

269

facilitator for HTN/HIV integration. Health care providers stated that: HTN services can be

270

tailored and refined to meet health needs of PLHIV. Additionally, HIV clinics have the

271

potential and capacity to implement HTN/HIV integrated services:

272

“With availability of resources, integration of hypertension care in our HIV clinics fits and is

273

appropriate for the patients with both conditions.” (KII, Member of the DHT).

274

“Yes, hypertension management fits very well within our HIV care programs. This is because

275

to manage hypertension you need trained staff, adequate supplies and space. … and I am happy

276

to inform you that we have three doctors in this small facility.” (KII, health facility manager

277

HIV clinic C).

278

Inadequacies in the design quality and packaging of HTN/HIV integration especially when

279

the program was being initiated was a barrier to the implementation. Health care providers

280

reported that the implementation of HTN/HIV integration policy by MoH was suboptimal. This

281

strongly distinguishing construct mainly affected the low performing clinics. Health care

282

providers at these clinics reported insufficiencies in the preparation, packaging and support for

283

HTN/HIV integration including lack of: staff and professional training systems such as initial

284

orientation to the new health guidelines; clear mechanisms on how resources will be distributed

285

at these facilities; reliable supplies; and necessary materials to implementing the program.

286

These healthcare providers noted that:

287

“The introduction of this program was not well communicated to the staff. We only got to know

288

that we are supposed to provide HTN services but not oriented …, not even a workshop. A

289

clear plan for HTN service provision should have been given to us and may be an official

290

launch involving patients and we healthcare providers. … so, I think orientation on the

291

management of hypertension within the clinics is important but we have not had it.” (KII,

292

facility manager, HIV clinic A).

293

At the intermediate site it was noted:

294

“Since we receive supplies from NMS as one batch, we have a challenge on how some of the

295

supplies needed for HTN management should be distributed at Outpatient Department (OPD)

296

and also at the HIV clinic” (KII, facility manager, HIV clinic B).

297

Although the presentation and design of the integration were cited as insufficient, healthcare

298

providers at the high implementing HIV clinic noted that they receive some support through

299

their organisation arrangements which has helped them to get acquainted with the HTN/HIV

300

integration program.

301

“We didn’t have any capacity building at the start. However, as an organisation, we regularly

302

have Continuous Medical Education (CME) on non-communicable diseases to boost the staffs’

303

knowledge. So we got some information on the suggested HTN/HIV integration strategies.”

304

(KII, clinician, site C).

305

Complexity was not a distinguishing construct perceived to facilitate HTN/HIV integration.

306

Across the HIV clinics, healthcare providers perceived provision of HTN care services as a

307

task which was not complex and that activities for integrated HTN/HIV care were

308

straightforward. However, an increased number of hypertensive PLHIV at the HIV clinics with

309

few healthcare providers would increase provider work load and complexity of handling all

310

patients. A member of the DHT stated:

311

“For now, running the HIV clinics when providing care for opportunistic infections (OIs) and

312

other NCDs isn’t difficult at these clinics. It has been done before. We have had HIV

313

implementing partners who support say TB care for patients with HIV. Although …. when

314

patients are many, it could be challenging for the few staff to offer care for the many

315

tasks.”(KII, DHT).

316

Outer Setting

317

Patient needs and resources was a barrier to HTN/HIV integration and weakly distinguished

318

performance across the three HIV clinics. Although HTN/HIV integration was noted as

319

important, both health care providers and patients were in agreement that, to a large extent,

320

HTN services at the HIV clinics were suboptimal to meeting the needs of PLHIV. Providers at

321

lower performing HIV clinics described HTN services as the least prioritized and that they

322

were not well-equipped to meet the needs of HTN patients and there were no indications of

323

efforts to deal with this barrier. In addition, most patients were not aware of HTN/HIV

324

integration which resulted into low demand for the service.

325

“Patients are mainly interested in getting the HIV medicine [ART] refills. They do not demand

326

for extra care unless their health has deteriorated. Most are not aware of other clinical service

327

we provide including HTN management.” (Lead nurse HIV clinic B).

328

“We also like to work on all patients’ conditions but we are sometimes limited by resources.

329

Even now, not much is being done to support HTN integration.” (KII, DHO).

330

Besides, several patients interviewed at all the clinics mentioned having little knowledge on

331

HTN/HIV integration and were seeking HTN care at other health facilities.

332

“Save for the good HIV care, it [HTN management] is almost not provided at this centre. It

333

was once when the doctor told me to take some tablets for hypertension. … yet when we go for

334

hypertension treatment at other health facilities, they always check your blood [pressure] and

335

even tell you how you are doing. So, I seek treatment outside this centre.” (IDI 1, HIV clinic

336

A).

337

Because the low implementing HIV clinics were not in a position to meet PLHIV’s needs for

338

HTN management, hypertensive PLHIV were often referred to other health facilities, a strategy

339

which HTN patients were not comfortable with.

340

“I was sent to Tororo general clinic (private for profit) to get checked and I was diagnosed

341

with hypertension. I have the results with me but I’m always told to go back for care at the

342

hospital.” (P2, FGD 2, HIV clinic A).

343

Peer pressure was not a distinguishing construct and presented as a negative influencer to

344

HTN/HIV integration. Health care providers were not aware of any HIV clinics implementing

345

HTN/HIV integration to learn or derive competitive pressure from:

346

“ I have not heard of any facility within or around the district [that is integrating HTN care].

347

Probably they are doing so, but there is no model health facility I can mention that we can

348

learn from nor healthcare provider to share their experiences and best practices for this

349

program as per now.” (KII, lead clinician HIV clinic C).

350

External Policy and Incentives was a weekly distinguishing construct that negatively

351

influenced HTN/HIV integration. There were few external strategies for HTN/HIV integration

352

through policies and guidelines. Although at the high performing site, healthcare providers

353

stated implementing the national HIV guidelines, their emphasis was on the HIV component:

354

“This site … offers a comprehensive HIV care program with focus both on prevention, care

355

and treatment. Currently we are implementing the 2016 National guidelines for HIV/AIDS with

356

emphasis on test and treat.” (Lead clinician HIV clinic C).

357

This construct was highlighted by healthcare providers at the low performing site that they

358

lacked comprehensive guidelines for HTN/HIV integration:

359

“We also lack specific standard operating procedures or documents to be followed in the

360

HTN/HIV integration.” (KII, Lead clinician HIV clinic A).

361

Besides, healthcare providers also reported insufficient support supervision from the health

362

authorities including MoH, DHT, and implementing partners in relation to HTN management.

363

Relatedly, there were no opportunities to review and support progress of HTN services at the

364

HIV clinics apart from HIV care and supplies.

365

“No! We have not received any supervision at the HIV clinic, may be at the OPD [outpatient

366

department]. At least for the past seven months I have been here, I have not seen any. Besides,

367

when we are asked about the clinic, we are often asked about HIV care and supplies”. (KII,

368

Lead nurse HIV clinic A).

369

Inner setting

370

We identified three sub-constructs under Implementation Climate that were relevant to

371

HTN/HIV integration. These were: compatibility, relative priority and organization incentives
14

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013920; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

372

and rewards. Compatibility was not a distinguishing construct but a potential facilitator.

373

Healthcare providers perceived that HTN/HIV integration was compatible and would fit within

374

the existing workflows at the HIV clinics. One of the healthcare providers noted:

375

“Yes, hypertension services do fit within our routine HIV care service provision. Our work

376

within the HIV clinic is systematic and even hypertension services can be incorporated. We

377

sometimes have BP measured at triage as we measure the patient weight and mid-upper arm

378

circumference”. (KII, lead clinician HIV clinic A).

379

Relative priority, was a weakly distinguishing construct which negatively influenced

380

HTN/HIV integration. Although health care providers reported that HTN management would

381

fit within the HIV clinic workflow, we found a relatively lower priority attached to HTN

382

management by the healthcare providers compared to HIV care and management of

383

opportunistic infections. Healthcare providers reported irregular provision of HTN services at

384

the HIV clinic and providers from the low and intermediate performing facilities explicitly

385

stated that:

386

“Basically, we provide the necessary HIV care services and also include care for opportunistic

387

infections like TB and other STIs. Of course, one big challenge is that these other added

388

services may not be frequently provided as expected. ... and often patients are many; much

389

work to do, so we prioritize HIV care”. (KII, lead clinician HIV clinic B).

390

“We often check the blood pressure for patients with known hypertension and prescribe for

391

them the medicines. However, those ones who are not yet known, we may check once in six

392

months or when they complain with signs and symptoms suggestive of hypertension.” (KII,

393

Lead clinician HIV clinic A).

394

Organization incentives and rewards was a strongly distinguishing construct that negatively

395

influenced HTN/HIV integration. While healthcare providers at the high performing HIV clinic

396

seemed to be motivated by the availability of equipment and other supplies to manage HTN,
15

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013920; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license .

397

healthcare providers at the lower preforming sites expressed the need to receive incentives like

398

functional BP equipment and HTN treatment supplies or rewards to motivate their action for

399

additional HTN services, which in this case were not available:

400

“There is no special facilitation to do that extra work. …. when such an intervention is to run,

401

at least an allowance for the added work. Even the medicines and other equipment should be

402

available. But we are still struggling to get better BP machines.” (KII, Lead clinician HIV

403

clinic A).

404

“The HIV clinic does not receive special facilitation [payment] for managing hypertension

405

cases.” (KII, Lead clinician HIV clinic B).

406

The two sub-constructs Available resources and Access to knowledge and information under

407

the Readiness for implementation construct were potential barriers to the HTN/HIV

408

integration. These two sub-constructs were strongly distinguishing. While they positively

409

influenced performance at the high performing site, they negatively affected performance at

410

the lower performing sites.

411

Available resources for HTN services within the HIV clinics was a strongly distinguishing

412

factor because the high performing site reported having adequate resources including staff who

413

manage HTN, functional BP machines at each department, and medicines for HTN:

414

“Yes, I think we have adequate support. We have resources like drugs, equipment they are

415

there, human resource. I can’t say that we are enough but we can’t fail to manage, however

416

few we are we can’t fail to let a case go, at least we manage the fact that the drugs are there

417

the equipment are there, we don’t have any excuse for not managing a hypertensive person.”

418

(KII, Lead clinician HIV clinic C).

16

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013920; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license .

419

On the contrary, low and intermediate performing HIV clinics reported lack of enough

420

equipment especially functional BP machines. They also experience frequent stockouts of the

421

medicines for HTN and the lack of specific funding towards HTN services:

422

“… sometimes the [BP] machine at the clinic breaks down and it takes a longer process to get

423

another. Yes. Most times we experience stockout of these HTN drugs, so we end up referring

424

the patients.” (KII, facility manager HIV clinic B).

425

Similarly, access to information and knowledge about HTN/HIV integration strongly

426

distinguished between high and low performing HIV clinics. At the high performing site,

427

healthcare providers reported often having trainings including continuing medical education

428

(CMEs) organised at their facility. Some of the CMEs would be refresher trainings and

429

education on NCDs care including HTN.

430

“We always have CMEs on hypertension cases, we have had workshops and trainings,

431

management of OIs and hypertension is part of it, that one has been done, so as far as capacity

432

development is concerned, that has been taken care of.” (KII, Lead clinician HIV clinic C).

433

On the other hand, healthcare providers at low and intermediate performing sites stated low

434

access to information and knowledge about HTN care for PLHIV. They identified lack of

435

trainings, few available trained staff at their sites, and poor learning environment as

436

contributing factors.

437

“We have not had [trainings or capacity building sessions on hypertension management] for

438

some time and that is the challenge that we have. You know medicine is dynamic and things

439

keep on changing, management of hypertension could have changed like for other conditions.

440

So I think refresher trainings on management of hypertension is important but we have not had

441

them.” (KII, facility manager A).

442

Another key informant from the district health office stated:
17

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license .

443

“It has been about one to two years back, when some health workers were trained on the

444

management of non-communicable diseases. The training happened, but only targeted

445

clinicians. Truly for us to be effective, we need all the others to be trained. Nurses need the

446

training too.” (KII, DHO).

447

Characteristics of individuals

448

Knowledge and beliefs about HTN/HIV integration was a strongly distinguishing construct

449

and a barrier. At the high and intermediate sites, healthcare providers were acquainted with

450

knowledge and skill to offer HTN services like BP measurement and prescription of medicine

451

while at the low performance site, some of the health care providers lacked the skills to

452

appropriately screen and treat HTN:

453

“I realized that health workers would report inconsistent BP measurements from patients.

454

Because if patient comes with results from triage and then I measure again, some results would

455

be different. In case the triage says the blood pressure is high, I would measure again in the

456

clinical room. Okay, there are some acceptable variations but there are those that are out of

457

range. So it creates the need for more trainings.” (KII, lead clinician HIV clinic A).

458

Self-efficacy, a strongly distinguishing construct, was a barrier to HTN/HIV integration at the

459

low and intermediate sites. While healthcare providers at the high performing site expressed

460

confidence in their own ability to screen and treat HTN, some healthcare providers at the lower

461

performing HIV clinics expressed low confidence in their own capabilities to screen and

462

prescribe medicines for HTN. One health care provider stated:

463

“Patients often present to us [with] different symptoms, in case you follow only these

464

symptoms, you may think its pressure yet it’s not. I have sometimes used the BP machine, but

465

because I don’t use it frequently, I don’t think I get exact measurements to conclude that one

466

has pressure.” (KII Lead nurse HIV clinic B).
18

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license .

467

Additionally, clinicians at the low performing site expressed concern that lower cadre

468

healthcare providers and the HIV peer counsellors, who often triage patients, lacked enough

469

expertise and confidence to accurately use BP machines for screening and monitoring patients’

470

BP.

471

“… I was noticing variations in the BP measurements, so I withdrew the machines. I told you

472

we no longer screen at triage, so basically integration of HTN care is not at its best because

473

now we depend on the signs and symptoms, not from the routine screening until we get

474

knowledgeable staff that we can place there [to triage] and they give us the correct BP

475

measurements.” (KII, lead clinician HIV clinic A).

476

Implementation process

477

Execution of HTN/HIN integration was a weakly distinguishing construct as responses across

478

the three clinics expressed sub optimal HTN services. Several key informants mentioned there

479

are no documents to guide the implementation of HTN/HIV integration at the HIV clinics.

480

HTN care activities at the HIV clinics appeared to be optional and were reported to remain at

481

the discretion of the healthcare provider on duty as mentioned by healthcare providers at the

482

low performing HIV clinic:

483

“… we concentrate on the HIV care package, including some STIs or opportunistic infections.

484

We sometimes include hypertension, but not frequently. Like at triage, screening for weight is

485

a must but for BP measurement, it can be once or twice a month.” (KII, lead clinician HIV

486

clinic A).

487

Reflection and Evaluation, was not a distinguishing construct but negatively influenced

488

HTN/HIV integration. Healthcare providers reported that there was no formalized monitoring

489

or evaluation process of HTN/HIV integrated services at the three HIV clinic. Besides, there

19

490

were neither known set targets nor reporting/ feedback mechanisms and tools for HTN/HIV

491

integration:

492

“We rarely report on HTN care at HIV clinic. Since the HIV card has no provision for

493

recording HTN data, we record on a separate paper which is added to the patient’s file.” (KII,

494

Lead nurse clinic B).

495

Another healthcare provider noted that:

496

“We need to have HTN evaluation forms at these HIV clinics which we don’t do. For example,

497

medical form 5, are often used up and out of stock, they are almost history at some facilities.

498

Patients are encouraged to buy books …. We don’t have good record system to facilitate quick

499

evaluation.” (KII, DHO).

500

Some healthcare providers were concerned that quality improvement for HTN/HIV integration

501

was not done for this program to be fully developed at their HIV clinics.

502

“... we have not had any specific evaluation for this integration since it was communicated to

503

us. Apart from the usual clinic reports that I send as a clinician, and I may inform them that

504

we have a given number of hypertensive patients… but no specific reports made similar to the

505

ones we make, say for TB.” (KII, lead clinician HIV clinic A).

506

Under the Engaging construct, the Opinion Leaders sub-construct was non-distinguishing

507

but negatively influenced HTN/HIV integration across the three sites. Key leaders at health

508

facilities, district level and in some HIV implementing partners were not exhibiting

509

commitment nor involvement in HTN/HIV integration. Besides, none of the HIV clinics had

510

enthusiastic healthcare providers who were committed to coordinating or overseeing the

511

implementation of HTN services.

512

“We recently rolled out consolidated HIV management guidelines 2016, laid out how you can

513

manage an HIV patient and they have also put emphasis on non-communicable diseases. …,

514

the main issue is who is following up the implementation of care for non-communicable disease

515

at these HIV clinics? This is because each health program and implementing partner

516

concentrate on their targeted disease outcomes. So, you find that they can under look this

517

integration of HTN care.” (KII, DHO).

518

Discussion

519

This study sought to evaluate factors that influence the integration of screening and treatment

520

of HTN into the HIV program in Uganda, using the CFIR. We used valance rating to identify

521

factors which distinguished performance for integrated HTN/HIV between the high and low

522

performing HIV clinics. We found ten CFIR constructs which distinguished performance, four

523

of which were in the inner setting domain. Six of the constructs distinguished performance

524

strongly while the remaining four weakly. All ten distinguishing constructs negatively

525

influenced HTN/HIV integration at the low and intermediate performing HIV clinics as

526

compared to the high performing clinic.

527

There were four constructs which positively influenced HTN/HIV integration at all the three

528

HIV clinics but did not distinguish performance. These included: Relative advantage,

529

Adaptability, Complexity of the intervention, and Compatibility of HTN care with existing

530

HIV services. We view these as the key facilitators for integrated HTN/HIV services in our

531

setting. In agreement with the facilitators we identified for integrated HTN/HIV services, there

532

is increasing demand for integrated rather than vertically oriented HTN and HIV services in

533

low-and middle income countries (LMIC) [5, 16, 17, 27-29]. Although some studies have

534

assessed barriers and facilitators for HTN care in the HIV program, this is the first study in

535

Africa to assess factors that influence HTN/HIV integration using the CFIR.

536

From the perspectives of both patients and providers across all the three clinics, integrated

537

HTN/HIV care is seen to have a relative advantage as compared to vertically oriented

538

programs. Providers agreed that having HTN/HIV integrated services will allow for improved

21

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013920; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

539

patient-centred care. For example, patients would receive both HTN and HIV services instead

540

of being referred to two different clinics. Furthermore, integration reduces duplication of

541

services, is cost effective and efficient [5, 16, 29]. Our recent work also showed that the HIV

542

cascade results were similar between patients with HIV alone and those with HIV and HTN

543

who received integrated care [18]. Such evidence bolsters the demand for integrated HTN/HIV

544

services from health care providers and patients that we see in the current study. Leveraging

545

HIV programs for HTN care may even provide a spillover effect to the non-HIV population by

546

increasing access to screening, treatment and control of HTN [5, 27].

547

Adaptability was a positive influencer of integrated HTN/HIV services. Health care providers

548

and leaders, especially in the high performing clinic, perceive that integrated HTN/HIV care

549

can be adapted and tailored to fit the workflow of the HIV clinics to meet patient needs. HIV

550

services were originally established as vertically oriented entities to address the emergency

551

nature of HIV. Now that HIV has evolved into a chronic disease, largely due to these intensive,

552

vertical efforts, leveraging successful HIV programs for NCD integration is highly

553

recommended [16, 29]. A large clinical trial in Uganda that integrated HTN care into the HIV

554

program showed that HTN control is better achieved in the HIV program as compared to the

555

non-HIV population [30]. This is a true demonstration of the adaptability of integrated

556

HTN/HIV service to the HIV program [30].

557

Most health care providers at all HIV clinics found HTN/HIV integration not to be complex,

558

making it a facilitator. However, providers anticipated that as more dually affected patients are

559

identified, the workload may become overwhelming if not met with a concomitant increase in

560

staffing or resources. Task shifting could assist in mitigating the impact on providers [18]. In

561

parallel with task shifting, as was and is done in the HIV context, programs must continue to

562

strengthen the capacity of the existing clinical workforce to provide integrated care through re-

563

education efforts, continuing medical education (CME), simplified evidence based treatment

564

protocols/algorithms, implementation guidelines and physical and/or digital decision aides [5,

565

16]. Since Access to information and knowledge was a barrier to HTN/HIV integration,

566

capacity building for HTN and other NCDs in HIV should not only target clinicians but all

567

cadres of staff so that the HTN/HIV services are supported by interdisciplinary teams for

568

sustainability and efficient task shifting [5, 16].

569

Health care providers noted that HTN/HIV integration was compatible with the existing

570

services in the HIV clinics and workflows. A project in Malawi that integrated screening and

571

treatment of HTN into the HIV clinics demonstrated that HTN care was compatible with HIV

572

services [5]. Indeed, as we demonstrated previously. the care cascades for both conditions can

573

be perfectly aligned [18].

574

All ten constructs which distinguished performance had a negative influence upon HTN/HIV

575

integration. Design quality and packaging was a barrier to HTN/HIV integration. Health care

576

providers from the lower performing clinics were not oriented on HTN/HIV integration, unlike

577

those at the high performing site. Additionally, Ugandan HIV programs will need to adopt the

578

WHO target of 50% for HTN screening, treatment, retention in care and control. Achieving

579

this will require quality improvement efforts and integration of CVD indicators into routinely

580

collected data at National, regional, district and health facilities [27].

581

Patient needs and resources weakly distinguished performance for HTN integration. Key

582

resources that hindered performance at the lower performing clinics included BP machines,

583

access to medicines for HTN, and information on HTN/HIV integration. Many patients were

584

not aware of HTN/HIV integration at the HIV clinic and, therefore, could not advocate for the

585

service. Fixed dose combinations of HTN medicines will reduce the pill burden of treating both

586

HTN and HIV. Additionally, differentiated service delivery models and Chronic Care Models

587

(CCM) for integrated HTN/HIV will strengthen treatment adherence and promote retention in

588

care and patient centeredness [14, 15, 17, 29, 31].

589

Relative priority was a weak barrier to HTN/HIV integration. Health care providers mentioned

590

that HTN screening and treatment among PLHIV are not prioritized. Providers mentioned that

591

BP measurement at HIV clinic is only done for clients who are already confirmed to have HTN

592

or those with symptoms but not all PLHIV. This non-prioritization of HTN services by

593

providers leaves out many patients undiagnosed with HTN since majority have no symptoms

594

especially in the early stages. This approach risks diagnosing patients very late with overt

595

complications of HTN yet PLHIV are already in close contact with the health care system and

596

present an opportunity for CVD screening, treatment and control [29]. Due to suboptimal

597

screening and treatment of HTN among PLHIV in Uganda, awareness of HTN and control

598

remain below 20% [7-12, 18].

599

Providers at the high performing clinic were motivated by incentives and available resources

600

including functional BP machines, access to medicines for HTN and human resources unlike

601

their counterparts at lower performing clinics who noted that they would derive motivation

602

from the same incentives and resources. Our findings are in agreement with a recent mixed

603

methods study in Nigeria that assessed the capability, opportunity and motivation for HTN/HIV

604

integration found that physical opportunity in form of BP machines and medicines was

605

suboptimal in most HIV clinics [28]. Strategies to improve access to medicines will require

606

607

HTN [5, 31].

608

Self-efficacy of health care providers to screen and treat HTN was low in the lower performing

609

HIV clinics unlike in the high performing clinic. Additionally, clinicians at the lower

610

performing clinics expressed lack of confidence in lower cadres of health care providers as far

611

as screening for HTN was concerned. These findings are supported by prior studies that have

612

found low levels of confidence and self-efficacy regarding HTN screening among multiple

613

cadres of health workers [28, 32]. Strategies to address providers’ confidence will rely on

614

improving knowledge and skills through cadre-appropriate training, mentorship and education

615

[5, 16].

616

Execution of HTN screening and treatment is generally suboptimal since it is at the discretion

617

of the clinician especially at the lower performing HIV clinics. Suboptimal screening leads to

618

low levels of awareness, treatment, retention and control of HTN among PLHIV [7-12, 18].

619

Thus, there is a need to routinely provide HTN screening and treatment at HIV clinics, through

620

use of standardized evidence based treatment protocols, improved access to medicines,

621

mentorship, target setting, improved systems for monitoring and evaluation, empowering

622

patients, task shifting, differentiated service delivery and community engagement [5, 31].

623

Participants in our study reported gaps in clinician documentation because providers record

624

clinical data in patients’ personal books. These records leave the clinic with the patient

625

following their visits. Enhanced systems for monitoring and evaluation for HTN in the HIV

626

clinics are critically needed. This gap limits access to patient data and information for

627

programmatic planning and continuous quality improvement. To close this gap, HTN care

628

indicators should be integrated into the electronic medical records (EMR) system that is

629

available and functional at HIV clinics [33].

630

We acknowledge the paucity of contributions to the present analysis by the many patient

631

participants interviewed for this study. Future implementation science research and analyses

632

should place more emphasis on patients’ perspectives and perceptions on HTN/HIV

633

integration.

635

Conclusions

636

Using the CFIR framework, we have shown that there are modifiable barriers to integrating

637

HTN services into the HIV clinic in the inner setting, outer setting, characteristics of

638

individuals and implementation process. Integrated HTN and HIV care is of great interest to

639

both patients and health care providers. Improving access to HTN and other CVD care among

640

PLHIV will require overcoming these barriers and capitalizing on the facilitators identified

641

using a health system strengthening approach [5]. Findings from this study provide a

642

springboard for designing contextually appropriate multicomponent interventions for

643

HTN/HIV integration in Uganda and other LMICs. To further build the case for integrated

644

HTN/HIV services, future research should determine the cost, cost effectiveness and treatment

645

outcomes for both HTN and HIV from integrated HTN/HIV services [16, 27].

Rating
-2

Criteria
The construct has a negative influence to HTN screening and treatment in the HIV clinic. An impeding
influence in work processes, and/or an impeding influence in implementation efforts. The majority of
interviewees (at least two) described with explicit examples how the key or all aspects of a construct
manifests itself in a negative way.

-1

The construct has a negative influence to HTN screening and treatment in the HIV clinic, an impeding
influence in work processes, and/or an impeding influence in implementation efforts. Interviewees make
general statements about the construct manifesting in a negative way but without concrete examples:
 The construct is mentioned only in passing or at a high level without examples or evidence of
actual, concrete descriptions of how that construct manifests;
 There is a mixed effect of different aspects of the construct but with a general overall negative
effect;
 There is sufficient information to make an indirect inference about the generally negative influence;
and/or
 Judged as weakly negative by the absence of the construct.
A construct has neutral influence to HTN screening and treatment in the HIV clinic if:
 It appears to have neutral effect (purely descriptive) or is only mentioned generically without
valence;
 There is no evidence of positive or negative influence;
 Credible or reliable interviewees contradict each other
 There are positive and negative influences at different levels in the organization that balance each
other out; and/or different aspects of the construct have positive influence while others have
negative influence and overall, the effect is neutral.
The construct is a positive influence to HTN screening and treatment in the HIV clinic, a facilitating
influence in work processes, and/or a facilitating influence in implementation efforts. Interviewees make
general statements about the construct manifesting in a positive way but without concrete
examples:
 The construct is mentioned only in passing or at a high level without examples or evidence of
actual, concrete descriptions of how that construct manifests;
 There is a mixed effect of different aspects of the construct but with a general overall positive
effect; and/or
 There is sufficient information to make an indirect inference about the generally positive influence.
The construct is a positive influence for HTN screening and treatment in the HIV clinic, a facilitating
influence in work processes, and/or a facilitating influence in implementation efforts. The majority of
interviewees (at least two) describe explicit examples of how the key or all aspects of a construct manifests
itself in a positive way.
Missing Interviewee(s) were not asked about the presence or influence of the construct; or if asked about a
construct, their responses did not correspond to the intended construct and were instead coded to another
construct. Interviewee(s) lack of knowledge about a construct does not necessarily indicate missing data and
may instead indicate the absence of the construct.
