Abstract

2

Introduction: Intestinal constipation is a clinical consequence, secondary to neuromotor

3

disturbances, which acts on subjects with cerebral palsy (CP). The aim of this study was to

4

investigate the factors influencing constipation and the quality of life (QOL) of CP subjects.

5

Materials and methods: We recruited a total of 63 subjects aging from 5-17 years with spastic

6

CP who received physical rehabilitation. The subjects were divided into two groups including

7

with and without constipation. Subjects were assigned into one of the 4 groups (G1-4) based

8

on the prevalence of 1) CP and 2) Constipation. Subjects were assigned as CP with

9

constipation (G1), CP without constipation (G2), and controls without CP with constipation

10

(G3) and without CP and without constipation (G4). Subjects’ demographics, use of

11

antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), motor function, caregiver priorities and child health index of life

12

with disabilities (CPCHILD) were included. In addition to medical metadata, a subset of

13

subjects was evaluated for oral and systemic inflammation through gingival bleeding and

14

serum cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) respectively. Statistical significance was

15

evaluated by ANOVA One-Way (parametric data) and Kruskal Wallis (non-parametric data).

16

Results: A significant relationship was found between the type of medication and constipation.

17

Subjects taking GABA and GABA+ (GABA in association with other medication) were more

18

likely to be constipated than the other groups (P < 0.01). Additionally, quality of life was directly

19

correlated with constipation; subjects in G1 presented the lower mean score of CPCHILD (49.0

20

±13.1) compared to G2 (71.5 ± 16.7), when compared to G3 (88.9 ± 7.5), and G4 (95.5 ±5.0)

21

(P < 0.01). Inflammation was more severe for patients in G1 (P < 0.001). There were no

22

differences among groups regarding gender (P = 0.332) and age (P = 0.292).

23

Conclusions: Our results suggest that constipation was mostly affected by the use of certain

24

antiepileptic drugs, namely GABA. This showed direct detrimental effect on CP quality of life,

25

which was influenced by inflammatory cytokines and the dosage and type of AEDs.

Introduction

29

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a life-limiting and costly disability [1]. CP is characterized by permanent

30

neuromotor disorder affecting movement and by non-progressive degeneration of the brain

31

[2]. As the major etiological factor for severe disability, the estimated prevalence of CP ranges

32

from 2.3 to 2.9 per 1000 live births observed in the United States (2011–2012 National Survey

33

of Children’s Health and the 2011–2013 National Health Interview Survey) [3]. Children with

34

CP experience limitations in everyday activities, all of which are factors influencing their quality

35

of life (QOL). It can be accompanied by difficulties related to perception, sensation, behavior,

36

cognition, communication, and epilepsy. And, their QOL can be impacted by the development

37

of musculoskeletal problems such as oral-gut motor impairment through muscle spasticity [2].

38
39

Due to an abnormal increase in muscle tone and injury to neural pathways, spasticity acts as

40

a negative factor in the lives of 85-90% of individuals with CP [2,4,5]. The severity of movement

41

disability is classified by Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) [6]. GMFCS is

42

stratified into five levels of body mobility: Level I (walks without limitations), Level II (walks with

43

limitations), Level III (walks using a hand-held mobility device), Level IV (self-mobility with

44

limitations) and Level V (transported in a wheelchair) [6]. Our previous studies demonstrated

45

that out of 254 subjects, 50 (19.7%) subjects had GMFCS I, II or III while 204 (80.3%)

46

presented GMFCS IV or V [7–9]. These proportion results reflect on the population of this

47

current cohort. It is worthy mentioning, that epilepsy prevalence increases in spastic CP

48

subjects as the levels of GMFCS rise (IV and V) [10]. In fact, epilepsy affects 77% of the

49

subjects with CP, and standard clinical treatment for epileptic CP patients is based on therapy

50

with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) [11]. As the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central

51

nervous system and also regulatory signal for muscle tone, Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)

52

is used for neuronal excitability control (e.g.: benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, topiramate,

53

vigabatrin, gabapentin enacarbil and ezogabine). Side effects of AEDs can range from

54

subjective reports of mild drowsiness to life-threatening neurologic and gastrointestinal

55

consequences [12].

56
57

The prevalence of severe constipation and lack of gastrointestinal control varies from 25% to

58

74% [3]. Constipation may be caused by multiple components including: 1) reduced intake of

59

fiber and liquids (responsible for the digestive system functioning) [13], 2) central nervous

60

system damage [14], 3) mobility reduction [15], 4) and/or the use of AEDs [13,16]. In subjects

61

using AEDs the incidence of constipation is elevated [7]. Other side effects co-occurring with

62

the gastrointestinal complications include oral dysbiosis, gingival bleeding (GB), and increase

63

of systemic inflammation [17]. The exact clinical phenomic factors that are influenced by the

64

use of AEDs and the impact on QOL remains elusive.

65
66

Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical factors that mostly influenced QOL in cerebral palsy

67

subjects. Results demonstrated positive relationships of gastrointestinal constipation and the

68

use of medication impacted the quality of life of CP patients. Of the AEDs tested, GABA was

69

the strongest factor that influenced constipation, with significant results to gut and oral

70

compartments. We further investigated the mechanism involved in the oral-gut phenotypes

71

and assayed the inflammation as a catalyst for the clinical observations. For a subset of 37

72

participants, all of whom were CP subjects, we analyzed the salivary cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-

73

10, IL1β, and TNF-α. Overall, the results demonstrated that, via elevated inflammation, the

74

most constipated subjects had increased frequency of non-communicable diseases (oral and

75

gut), leading to a decrease in QOL.

was obtained from the guardian of each child or adolescent after they were informed about the

82

study. A cross-sectional study was performed with subjects with spastic CP diagnosis, who

83

received a physical rehabilitation treatment at a referral center in São Paulo, Brazil, at the time

84

of data collection.

85
86

Participants

87

One hundred subjects with a medical diagnosis of CP were invited to participate in this study

88

at AACD (Disabled Child Care Association) in São Paulo, Brazil. Inclusion criteria were a

89

medical diagnosis of spastic CP raging from 5–17 years, both male and female, and presence

90

or absence of constipation. Participants who presented progressive or neurodegenerative

91

lesions or uncooperative behavior were excluded during clinical oral examinations. Data was

92

collected from year of 2018 until 2019. Both demographic and clinical data were collected for

93

each subject.

94
95

Gastrointestinal (GI) Constipation

96

This study adopted the clinical constipation definition proposed by the Rome III criteria for

97

constipation [18]. The individuals must present two or more of the following symptoms, in the

98

previous three months, to be classified as presenting constipation including: (a) makes force

99

to evacuate during at least 25% of defecations; (b) hard or irregular stools in at least 25% of

100

defecations; (c) sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations; (d)

101

sensation of obstruction for at least 25% of defecations; (e) use of manual maneuvers in at

102

least 25% of defecations; (f) less than three defecations per week.

103
104

The final sample of the study was composed of 30 subjects with CP with constipation (G1), 33

105

subjects with CP without constipation (G2), 7 subjects without CP with constipation (G3) and

106

23 subjects without CP and without constipation (G4). Data regarding gender, age, race (white,

107

black and others), caregiver occupation and education, family income, medical diagnosis of

CP according to the type of movement disorder (spastic), clinical pattern (tetraplegia, diplegia

109

and hemiplegia), Gross Motor Function Classification System [6] (levels I to V) and use of

110

AEDs were collected from their medical records. Caregivers answered the Caregiver Priorities

111

and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities [19] that consists of 36 items rated in six

112

sections. CPCHILD is represented by the following domains: (1) Personal Care (eight items);

113

(2) Positioning, Transfer, and Mobility (eight items); (3) Communication and Social Interaction

114

(seven items); (4) Comfort, Emotions, and Behavior (nine items); (5) Health (three items); and

115

(6) Overall Quality Of Life (one item).

116
117

Saliva Collection

118

Unstimulated saliva samples were collected in dental assessment sessions. Subjects were

119

asked to refrain from eating, drinking liquids or brushing their teeth for at least 1 hour prior to

120

saliva collection. The collection was performed with the subjects sitting comfortably in a bright

121

and ventilated room. Whole saliva was collected by passive flow for 5 minutes. After collection,

122

the Salivette® was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for five minutes at 4°C (Hettich Centrifuge, model

123

Universal 320R, Tuttlingen, Germany) and frozen in a freezer at -80°C.

124
125

Biomarker Sub Analysis

126

The analysis of cytokines in saliva was performed using a CBA Cytokine Inflammatory Kit

127

(Becton Dickinson, CA, USA) for the detection of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10. All analyses

128

were performed in duplicate. Briefly, 25μL of fluorescent particles conjugated to antibodies

129

specific for each cytokine were added to 25μL of the saliva and incubated for one hour at room

130

temperature away from light. Subsequently, 25μL of the secondary antibody conjugated to a

131

fluorochrome was added to the mixture and incubated for two hours at room temperature. The

132

results were compared to a standard curve with serially diluted cytokines. The particles were

133

washed to remove unbound antibodies, resuspended in wash buffer and analyzed using a BD

Accuri (BD Biosciences). Data acquisition was performed using BD-Accuri C6 Software, and

135

concentrations were determined using FCAP software v.3.0 (BD Biosciences).

136
137

Gingival Index (GI)

138

The evaluation of oral dysbiosis was assayed through the GI [20] by using a millimeter plastic

139

periodontal probe (HuFriedy’s Colorvue PerioScreen Kit probe, Chicago, IL, USA), which was

140

gently passed in the gingival margin of all teeth, in reference to the distobuccal papilla, the

141

buccal margin, the mesiobuccal papilla and the lingual / palliative margin. Partially erupted

142

teeth and residual roots were excluded without replacement. The index was calculated by the

143

percentage of the sum of the individual values of each tooth divided by the number of faces

144

examined. Classified as positive for gingivitis were the individuals that presented gingival

145

marginal bleeding more than 20% of the total sites evaluated [20].

146
147

Statistical Analyses

148

Analyses of descriptive statistics were performed to characterize the sample, calculate

149

measures of central tendency and variability for the quantitative variables. The normality

150

assumption of the quantitative variables was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilks test. When

151

normal distribution was observed, parametric tests were performed. Otherwise, non-

152

parametric tests were selected to determine the significance of intergroups differences. The

153

Chi-square test was used to analyze the variables of gender, presence of gingival bleeding,

154

clinical type of CP, GMFCS, and AEDs used.

155
156

ANOVA One-Way (parametric data) was used to determine significant intergroups differences

157

in relation to age and the periodontal condition studied. Kruskal Wallis(nonparametric data)

158

was used to determine significant differences in relation intergroups cytokines levels. IBM

159

SPSS Statistics (SPSS for Windows, Version 20.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) was used for all

1-Participants Demographics

165

The goal of our study was to identify the main factors affecting QOL in CP subjects. We

166

focused on first collecting subject information including demographics, clinical factors, and

167

AEDs as potential influencers on a patient’s wellbeing and QOL (Table 1). In our population,

168

47 of our 93 subjects were female and 46 were male, accurately representing the relatively

169

equal ratio of women to men. The sample power was calculated using means and standard

170

deviations of overall domains among subjects with CP with constipation (51.0±13.1), subjects

171

with CP without constipation (28.5±16.7), subjects without CP with constipation (11.1±7.5) and

172

subjects without CP and without constipation (4.5±5.0) (OpenEpi online; www.openepi.com).

173

The results showed that the G*Power at the 95% confidence interval was 96.88%.

174
175

There were no significant differences among groups regarding gender (P = 0.332), age (P =

176

0.291), race (P = 0.08), and education (P = 0.5628), yet significant differences were found on

177

caregivers occupation (P = 0.0017) and family income (P = 0.018). G1 was composed of 30

178

non-ambulatory subjects (GMFCS levels IV and V) and G2 of 14 ambulatory subjects (GMFCS

179

levels I, II, and III) (P = 0.0002). Worse QOL measures were observed for constipated subjects

180

presenting the clinical pattern tetraplegia when compared to non-constipated CP (P < 0.001)

181

(Table 1). Interestingly, gender was significantly associated with constipation (P < 0.05) with

182

females appearing more likely to be constipated in our population. Distribution of age in our

183

population shows a peak at ~6 years of age, with a slight steady dropoff in population

184

representation until approximately age 14, with a steep dropoff in population representation

185

from ages 14-19 (Figure 1A).

2- CP Diagnosis

188

When diagnosing CP, there are three widely accepted presentations: 1) hemiplegic, or

189

Increased muscle tone in a hemibody; 2) diplegic, Increased muscle tone in lower limbs (may

190

affect upper limbs, but to a lesser extent); and 3) tetraplegic, a system-wide decay of

191

neuromotor function, represented by increased muscle tone in all four limbs and trunk

192

involvement. In our population, the distribution of subjects is made up of these three groups

193

as well as healthy individuals (control). Hemiplegia is the least prominent in our population,

194

with 9.68% of subjects presenting hemiplegia, 26.88% diplegia, and 31.18% tetraplegia

195

(32.26% of our population was healthy at examination) (Figure 1B). CP diagnosis was found

196

to be significant in our population (P < 0.001) in determining QOL (Table 1).

197
198

Another mechanism to classify subjects with spastic CP is according to the motor function

199

ability. The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS classify as ambulatory that

200

ones who present levels I-III, while levels IV and V are reserved for non-ambulatory subjects.

201

In our population, levels I (37.63%), IV (29.03%) and V (23.66%) make up the vast majority of

202

our population (Figure 1C). Level I is mostly populated by our control group, while groups IV

203

and V are reserved for subjects with severe CP, namely diplegic and tetraplegic CP (Figure

204

1D). More specifically, group IV is made up of diplegics subjects who can typically operate a

205

wheelchair manually, while tetraplegic subjects require caregiver-assisted or motorized forms

206

of transportation.

207
208

We found that a subject’s GMFCS level was statistically significant in determining their QOL

209

(P < 0.001). Functional motor independence of subjects with CP is directly related to the extent

210

of cortical injury. Diplegic and quadriplegic subjects (GMFCS IV and V) have significant motor

211

impairment that limits daily living activities. Therefore, the diagnosis of CP and greater motor

212

damage are two strong factors that influence the quality of life of the subjects.

3- Constipation Impact on Quality of Life

215

According to CPCHILD, the groups differed significantly (P < 0.05). G1 presented higher

216

values (lower QOL) for all sections of the questionnaire while compared to G2, G3 and G4.

217

The CPCHILD questionnaire measures QOL presented 6 subscores: 1) Positioning,

218

Transferring, and Mobility; 2) Caregiver-Reported QOL; 3) Hospitalization and Caregiver-

219

Reported Health; 4) Comfort and Emotions; 5) Personal Care; and 6) Communication and

220

Social Interaction. These subscores are scaled from 0 to 100 and were averaged to determine

221

overall QOL. The combination of constipation and cerebral palsy, showed to lower the quality

222

of life of each individual. The inability to effectively and routinely have bowel movements and

223

the inhibition or even incapability to move freely leads to fewer opportunities and consequently

224

lower overall QOL.

225
226

In our initial analysis, we uncovered the aspects of subject’s life that determine their overall

227

QOL. In figure 2, each subscore is plotted in relation to the remaining 5 subscores. For

228

example, figures 2A-F show Hospitalization and Caregiver-Reported Health (HCRH)

229

compared to all other subscores. A striking trend is observed wherein a particular subscore (in

230

this case) was not particularly influential in determining overall QOL, as a rating of 80 in HCRH

231

can still yield QOL scores as low as 20. Conversely, Communication and Social Interaction

232

(CSI) scores much more closely reflect QOL scores as a whole. Gender was not significantly

233

correlated with QOL in our population. Further analysis into what physical and psychological

234

factors that most directly pertain to a subject’s QOL is required to better understand and treat

235

CP subjects.

236
237

3- Medication Affecting Constipation

238

The key factor affecting QOL and constipation in our population was revealed to be medication

239

types. As the common thread linking all CP subjects, pharmacological treatment is an essential

240

point of emphasis of our study. Subjects that use of GABA (the principal inhibitory

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011296; this version posted November 8, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

10

241

neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and regulate muscle tone) and GABA+

242

presented the worst quality of life. The use of sodium inhibitors (Na inhibitor) were positively

243

correlated with a higher quality of life, potentially due to the removal of sodium from the

244

digestive tract, yielding softer stool (Figure 1 A-C). Specifically, the choice of AED used for

245

treatment of CP and epilepsy greatly influenced the physical and mental health of our subjects.

246

GB is seen in figures 3D-F to be higher in subjects taking GABA and GABA+, or GABA in

247

association with other AEDs. Conversely, subjects taking sodium inhibitors were clustered at

248

lower mean GB.

249
250

Sodium inhibitors were associated with a higher QOL and GABA (the chief inhibitory

251

neurotransmitter in our body) was associated with a lower QOL. Similarly, GABA+ was

252

associated with a significantly lower QOL. In Figure 3G, there is a clear trend wherein GABA

253

subjects are clustered at a lower QOL, while sodium inhibitor subjects, particularly in our non-

254

constipated subcohort (Figure 3H), exhibit a clustering at a much higher QOL. Calcium

255

inhibitors were only taken by 2 subjects in our population, so further studies must be performed

256

with larger populations to fully understand their effect on the QOL and bowel health of CP and

257

epilepsy subjects.With this information, it is clear that the adverse effects of GABA on a

258

subjects’ body and mental wellbeing must be observed further; similarly, sodium inhibitors

259

should be studied to determine their efficacy as an AED as a replacement for or synergistically

260

with GABA.

261
262

4- Oral and Systemic Inflammation are Elevated in Constipated Patients

263

From a clinical perspective, CP is considered a neurological disease. However, its symptoms

264

can manifest themselves throughout the body. In many subjects, the lack of an ability to care

265

for oneself leads to the development of oral and gum disease. These diseases manifest

266

themselves through bleeding of the gingiva. If a large number of teeth have bleeding gingiva,

11

267

there is a high chance of oral disease manifesting itself as gingival inflammation and

268

periodontitis.

269
270

In figure 4A, Density for males (green) appears more concentrated at lower levels of Gingival

271

bleeding (GB). Females (blue) are more stratified, but still show a higher density where GB is

< 20%. The average GB observed for males was 8.37±12.18%, while the same for females

273

was 16.70±22.26%. Overall mean GB was 12.08±18.27%. In figure 4B, a slight visual trend is

274

observed with the upper limit of mean GB decreasing with age. Higher densities of high

275

gingival index occur in younger subjects, while higher densities of low gingival bleeding occur

276

in older subjects. Healthy individuals (those who do not suffer from CP) have markedly lower

277

mean GB (23%) than any other group, with 2.79% mean hemiplegic GB, 12.19% mean diplegic

278

GB, and 27.11% mean tetraplegic GB (Figure 4C).

279
280

Indirect symptoms of CP are not limited to the oral cavity; gastrointestinal problems can often

281

arise as a reaction to medications or from an inability to properly digest and pass food. Of our

282

63 subjects who present CP, 30 were constipated at examination, representing a drastically

283

higher prevalence of constipation (47.62%) compared to the estimated prevalence of 16% in

284

the global population [21].

285
286

For a subset of our population, we collected salivary cytokine measures to get an accurate

287

idea of systemic inflammation and its relationship with constipation and medication. For all

288

cytokines for which data was collected (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, and TNF-α), mean levels

289

approximately doubled in constipated subjects. In figures 5A-E, there is a clear visual trend of

290

higher resting systemic inflammation in individuals with severe CP. Of these cytokines, only

291

IL1β was significantly correlated with constipation (P < 0.05, Figure 5D).

Figure 6 reveals the positive and negative correlations in our study cohort among clinical

294

factors and demographics. Naturally, each subscore is correlated with the overall QOL of an

295

individual as they are part of its calculation. Key trends to notice are: 1) The presence of

296

constipation significantly lowers QOL; 2) GMFCS and CP Type are strongly correlated, both

297

to one another and to QOL; 3) GB exhibits a strong negative correlation with QOL that is

298

statistically significant; and 4) Overall QOL is more strongly correlated to the self-reported

299

mental health of -subject than to caregiver-reported metrics.

Discussion

302
303

The results provided novel information related to the severity of CP and the consequences of

304

treatment on constipation, oral health, and quality of life. To the best of our knowledge, this is

305

the first study to evaluate the association between intestinal constipation and quality of life of

306

CP using the Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities. According to

307

the motor type disorder, subjects with CP are classified as at least one of spastic, dyskinetic

308

(dystonic, choreic and athetosic), or ataxic. The subjects presented spastic CP, the most

309

prevalent type of motor disorder, with tetraplegia the clinical pattern most prevalent (32.26%)

310

(Figure 1B). Consistent with our results, tetraplegia was also observed in a 3,294 children

311

study developed in 18 states in the USA (32.9%) [22]. Early brain damage triggers complex

312

adaptive neuroplasticity processes involving multiple functional systems. Different factors

313

interact with brain plasticity potentials, influencing the natural history of cerebral palsy in the

314

early years of childhood [23]. The later the interdisciplinary intervention, the smaller the gain

315

during brain plasticity, reducing the potential for improvement in the individual’s condition.

316
317

Here, we observed a shortage of national instruments, which appears to reflect the difficulty

318

of the scientific community to develop tools for assessing quality of life that apply to the socio-

319

cultural diversity of the country. For all questionnaires revised, only Caregiver Priorities and

320

Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD) [19] and Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life

321

Questionnaire for Children Child report (CPQol-Child) [24] are specific to Cerebral Palsy

322

subjects. CPQOL-Child is the individual's own report, since it was mostly used in children with

323

GMFCS level I or II and were excluded the individual with any intellectual deficits and lack of

324

an efficient communication system. In this study, the largest number of individuals belonged

325

to GMFCS level IV and V (Figure 1C) and due to the difficulty of communication, their

326

caregivers answered the questionnaire as their proxy; in this case the CPCHILD is the best

327

choice of questionnaire. The other questionnaires were for children and adapted for a wide

328

range of disabilities, while CPCHILD is more specific to our study population. The Cronbach's

329

alpha value estimated for the Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of Life with

330

Disabilities was 0.879. It was observed that G1 presented a higher mean score of CPCHILD

331

(51.0 ±13.1) compared to G2 (28.5 ± 16.7), G3 (11.1 ± 7.5), and G4 (4.5 ±5.0) (P < 0.05)

332

(Table 1).Seventy percent of caregivers of CP subjects in this study had less than 8 years of

333

study (Table1). Intellectual capital, represented by education, increases the likelihood of

334

access to information, health-related issues [25] facilitating understanding and recognizing the

335

importance of self-care. A low level of caregiver education influences the child's overall health,

336

represented by self-care of general and oral health [26].

337
338

The possible explanation for the lower education level of caregivers for individuals with CP is

339

the ‘caregiver martyr syndrome’ wherein a caregiver neglects their own health, studies, and

340

finances to provide more frequent and consistent [27] care [27]. With a lower educational level

341

and fewer paid employment opportunities, there is a direct logical connection linking

342

significantly lower income to caregivers of individuals with CP (Table 1). Caregivers' potentially

343

lower standard of education prevents them from entering the skilled labor market. Thus, they

344

dedicate themselves exclusively to household chores and taking care of the individual with CP

345

[28]. Emerging concepts of quality of life related to CP are emerging, and in the last five years,

346

a total of 469 articles were found in the literature.

348

We noticed that the severity of pain and discomfort has been associated with increased motor

349

impairment and other comorbidities, particularly constipation and spasticity. In individuals with

350

minor GMFCS, pain was observed during voluntary movements, whereas in individuals with

351

larger GMFCS, pain was directly related to movement performed by the caregiver or therapist

352

[29]. Higher intensity of pain and discomfort had a negative effect on physical and

353

psychological quality of life (Figure 2A–F). Communication and social interactions in

354

individuals with cerebral palsy in GMFCS level V with intellectual disability develop less

355

favorably and show large variation [30] (Figure 2F). Fairhust et al. concluded in 2018 that

356

increasing awareness of CP pain and comorbidities, particularly overall health and

357

constipation, can help prevent and treat the disorder more effectively, increasing patients’

358

overall quality of life.

359
360

Medication such as AEDs are frequently used for the control of epileptic seizures [31]. These

361

drugs can be administered in monotherapy or polytherapy, depending on the response to

362

seizure control [32]. Results demonstrated that individuals with a lower quality of life were

363

positively correlated to those who use polytherapeutic GABA treatments (GABA+), while those

364

who use monotherapy, especially sodium channel inhibitors, have a better quality of life (Figure

365

3C) when compared with GABA and GABA+ (Figure 3B). AEDs have an effect on voltage-

366

dependent modulation of sodium, calcium, and potassium channels, and the Aminobutyric

367

Gamma Acid (GABA) is considered the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter not only in the

368

central nervous system, but also on enteric nerves [32]. However, AEDs aims to achieve

369

seizure control are usually limited by toxicity and adverse effects that impair an individual's

370

quality of life [33] (Figure 3B-D). The subjects taking GABA or GABA association presented a

371

negative correlation with quality of life and also present intestinal constipation not only for the

372

inhibitory GABA action, [34] but may also be related to dysbiosis.

373

A higher prevalence of gingivitis was observed in constipated subjects from this study, that

374

were in use of GABA/or GABA+ (Figure 3E-G, Supplementary Figure 1). G1 presented

375

significantly higher percentages of subjects with gingivitis compared to all other groups (P <

376

0.001). Additionally, CP subjects using GABA or GABA+ who were constipated had higher

377

levels of gingival bleeding than those who did not (P = 0.006, Table 1). Current literature

378

indicates that intestinal disorders play a prominent role in inflammatory responses to

379

neurological conditions [35]. This line of evidence is fundamental to identifying the effects of

380

dysbiosis on mucosal inflammation throughout the digestive tract. Significantly higher levels of

381

IL1β , IL6, IL8, and IL10 were found in constipated subjects with gingival bleeding from this

382

study (Figure 5), indicating an ongoing inflammatory process and the progression of

383

periodontal disease [36–40]. Since the use of these medications cause CP subjects to present

384

a reduced salivary flow rate, an increased value of salivary osmolality, dry mouth and gingivitis,

385

which is represented by higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in quadriplegics [17]. Sodium

386

inhibitors, however, have a less severe correlation with gingival bleeding (R 2=.684), but have

387

markedly lower effects on a patient’s QOL and they are associated with lower levels of

388

constipation, it can be assumed that sodium inhibitors carry less of a systemic reaction in our

389

study population.

390

Constipation is a common comorbidity described in CP subjects [13], and current literature

391

agrees that constipation is the causal factor of gut dysbiosis [41,42]. Constipation prevalence

392

observed in this study was higher (47.62%), with higher prevalence in females CP subjects

393

(Figure 4). Females without CP present constipation and almost 2 times more likely to suffer

394

from constipation than males [43]. Constipation and intestinal dysbiosis leads to increased

395

mucosal permeability (leaky-gut) [42] of the Gut-Brain Axis [44] increasing serum endotoxin

396

concentration. These endotoxins activate the immune system and promote IL1β production as

397

observed in individuals with Autism Syndrome Disorder [45]. Moreover, there has been no

398

published research to date that evaluated the effect of dysbiosis on gingivitis development in

399

individuals with cerebral palsy.

401

In addition to GI and oral inflammation, we have observed gender to be an important variable

402

in regard to inflammation. Females presented higher pro-inflammatory cytokine expression

403

when compared to males (Figure 4). This gender bias has not been addressed in the literature

404

and will require further studies. The possible explanation for these findings may be related to

405

the phenomenon that CP occurs more frequently in male [46] categorized as GMFCS V [47].

406

Due to this limitation, these subjects require more advanced care, notably oral care and

407

hygiene performed by the caregiver. Perhaps the females were able to perform oral hygiene

408

on their own due to fewer neuromotor limitations, which in turn may have resulted in greater

409

gingival bleeding. Additionally, hormonal changes in puberty should be examined as a factor

410

for this observed gender dichotomy [48].

411
412

Inflammatory biomarkers can be evaluated both in serum [49] or in saliva [8]. Blood collection

413

in subjects with CP is a hard task, because these subjects present sympathetic nervous

414

system predominance [50], resulting in vasoconstriction, and consequently making peripheral

415

venous access more difficult. On the other hand, saliva is readily available and its components

416

are easy to be collected, and that has been used to evaluate salivary parameters in subjects

417

with CP [17]. Ideal for future longitudinal monitoring.

418
419

The comparison between the subjects constipated and non-constipated from this study

420

demonstrated that constipation acts as a damaging factor causing approximately doubled

421

mean cytokine production (Figures 5A-E). In the presence of dysbiosis, virulence factors are

422

released from pathogenic microorganisms present in the oral cavity, activating host's immune-

423

inflammatory responses [51–53]. IL1-β is an inflammatory cytokine associated with innate

424

immune response, inflammation, pathogenesis and progression of periodontal disease

425

[54,55]. Higher levels of IL1β (P < 0.05) were found in this study’s subjects, who were

426

constipated and presented higher values of gingival bleeding (Figure 5B, Supplementary

427

Figure 2B). Previous studies showed higher levels of IL-1β IL-6, IL-8 in spastic CP subjects

428

presenting GMCFS level V [17].

429
430

Significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were found in constipated subjects with

431

gingival bleeding (Figure 5C-E; Supplementary Figure 2C-E). These cytokines represent the

432

action of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines [55], critical biomarkers of

433

periodontal inflammation corresponding to the clinical severity of the disease [37]. IL-6 and IL-

434

8 were also described as potential predictors for oral diseases, reinforcing the importance of

435

evaluating the salivary levels of these biomarkers [56]. The presence of the chemokine IL-8

436

induces the secretion of lymphocytes, monocytes, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, tumor cells, bone

437

resorption and IL-1β, indicating an ongoing inflammatory process and the progression of

438

periodontal disease [38,39]. IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, inhibiting pro-

439

inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 associated with improvements in periodontal clinical

440

parameters [57]. However, the degree of mucosal inflammation of constipated CP subjects

441

represented by gingival bleeding was so high that IL-10 action did not reduce inflammatory

442

process of dysbiosis [40]. Only one study reported the effect of mechanical treatment on

443

gingivitis control measures by cytokines levels, and the results showed that, although occurs

444

reduction of inflammatory process, the levels of IL-1β, I6 and IL-8 remain high compared to

445

subjects without CP [8]. In conclusion, constipation has a direct detrimental effect on quality

446

of life, which is influenced by antiepileptic drugs intake, type of antiepileptic drugs, and

447

inflammatory signals.

(32.26%), diplegics (26.88%), and hemiplegics (9.68%). C) Distribution is measured

643

along the GMFCS scale from I-V. Stages I-III are considered ambulatory, while stages

644

IV and V require significant assistance (typically a wheelchair or mobility scooter). Stages

645

II and III are less represented (3.23% and 6.45% respectively), while stages I (37.63%),

646

IV (29.03%) and V (23.66%) make up the vast majority of our population. D) Clustering

647

shows that hemiplegics and healthy individuals are more likely to be ambulatory, most

648

without assistance. However, diplegic and tetraplegic individuals are by definition not

649

ambulatory, due to the increased muscle tone. Therefore, diplegics are frequently

650

classified as GMFCS stage IV and tetraplegics as stage V.
