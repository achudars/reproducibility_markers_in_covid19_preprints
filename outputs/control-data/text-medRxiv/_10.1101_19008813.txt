Abstract
Given the restricted total scanning time for clinical neuroimaging, it is unclear whether clinical
diffusion MRI protocols would benefit more from higher spatial resolution or higher angular
resolution. In this work, we investigated the relative benefit of improving spatial or angular
resolution in diffusion MRI to separate two parallel running white matter tracts that are targets for
deep brain stimulation: the anterior thalamic radiation and the supero-lateral branch of the medial
forebrain bundle. Both these tracts are situated in the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule,
and recent studies suggest that targeting a specific tract could improve treatment efficacy.
Therefore, we scanned 19 healthy volunteers at 3T and 7T according to three diffusion MRI protocols
with respectively standard clinical settings, increased spatial resolution of 1.4 mm, and increased
angular resolution (64 additional gradient directions at b=2200s/mm2). We performed probabilistic
tractography for all protocols and quantified the separability of both tracts. The higher spatial
resolution protocol improved separability by 41% with respect to the clinical standard, presumably
due to decreased partial voluming. The higher angular resolution protocol resulted in increased
apparent tract volumes and overlap, which is disadvantageous for application in precise treatment
planning. We thus recommend to increase the spatial resolution for deep brain stimulation planning
to 1.4 mm while maintaining angular resolution. This recommendation complements the general
advice to aim for high angular resolution to resolve crossing fibers, confirming that the specific
application and anatomical considerations are leading in clinical diffusion MRI protocol optimization.

Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for movement disorders and is also used for
several treatment-refractory psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and
major depressive disorder (MDD). DBS for these indications has been successful in multiple targeted
brain regions (Alonso et al., 2015), although there is a shift towards understanding DBS as a network
effect (Figee et al., 2013), with an increased focus on targeting specific white matter bundles
visualized with tractography (Noecker et al., 2017).
The (ventral) anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is a popular DBS target for psychiatric
indications (Tierney, Abd-El-Barr, Stanford, Foote, & Okun, 2014). Earlier work on the neuroanatomy
of the ALIC has shown that there is a large amount of inter-subject variance in the white matter
organization (Coenen, Panksepp, Hurwitz, Urbach, & Mädler, 2012; Makris et al., 2016; Nanda,
Banks, Pathak, & Sheth, 2017). This suggests that accurate subject-specific tractography is required
for clinical applications. Tractography studies have pointed towards the supero-lateral medial
forebrain bundle (slMFB) (Coenen et al., 2012; Liebrand et al., 2019), and, more recently, to the
anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) (Baldermann et al., 2019), as the preferred DBS target in the ALIC.
The ATR connects the anterior thalamus with the prefrontal cortex, while the slMFB constitutes the
rostral part of the cortico-pontine connection between the ventral tegmental area and prefrontal
cortex (Coenen et al., 2012). When passing through the ALIC, these bundles are oriented in
approximately the anterior-posterior direction with, typically, a respective medial-lateral
organization.
In order to refine tractography-assisted DBS targeting, and evaluate the relative benefits of slMFB
versus ATR stimulation in the ALIC, more prospective tractography studies are necessary. DBS
targeting requires high precision, and in our experience slight alterations in placement may affect the
treatment outcome (Liebrand et al., 2019). Therefore, it is important to optimize diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) acquisitions and develop robust tractography pipelines for these studies. Current
clinical applications of tractography are often based on the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model
(Petersen et al., 2016), which enables reproducible reconstruction of the major white matter tracts,
despite the low spatial and angular resolution of the DWI’s (Wakana et al., 2007). However, the DTI
model cannot account for more complex fiber configurations, such as fibers crossing or touching,
which may occur in up to 90% of white matter voxels (Jeurissen, Leemans, Tournier, Jones, & Sijbers,
2013). It is therefore suggested to acquire DWI data at a higher angular resolution and with multiple
b-values, in order to use more sophisticated models that can resolve multiple fiber populations
within each voxel (Caan et al., 2010).
Here, we focus on optimizing the acquisition for distinguishing the slMFB and ATR in the ALIC with
tractography for use in a clinical setting. It can be reasoned that resolving parallel fibers in the ALIC
does not require high angular resolution compared to crossing fiber configurations, so that, as long
as the angular resolution (i.e. diffusion sensitivity) is sufficient to detect tract orientations, clinical
scanning time can be spent on improving spatial resolution (i.e. voxel size). For this reason, we
investigate the tradeoff between angular and spatial resolution for reconstructing and distinguishing
between both tracts by comparing a standard clinical 3T protocol to respectively high angular (3T)
and high spatial (7T) resolution protocols. Tract reconstructions for each protocol will be evaluated

based on their capability to resolve the slMFB and ATR, to choose the optimal tradeoff for specific
targeting of either bundle.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Nineteen healthy volunteers were included in this study approved by the Institutional Review Board
after giving written informed consent. After screening for MR contraindications, all participants were
scanned in 3T and 7T scanners, with both scanning sessions taking place on the same day in the
period between August and October, 2017. Structural (T1 and T2-weighted) scans were made at 3T
to allow for comparison between the diffusion protocols in individual structural space.
Scan protocols
Data were acquired on Philips Ingenia 3T and Achieva 7T scanners (Philips Medical Systems, Best,
Netherlands) equipped with 32-channel phased-array head coils (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). A
complete overview of the applied diffusion MRI scan parameters is given in Table 1. Three diffusionweighted scans were made: a standard scan with parameters similar to clinical protocol of around 3
minutes, and two high resolution scans with a duration of approximately 10 minutes, which is a
timescale that is usable in the clinic. One high resolution scan included more diffusion orientation
measurements (higher angular resolution), and the other had a higher spatial resolution,
respectively. We will refer to these as the HARDI and HSRDI scans.

The standard scan was made at 3T with an isotropic 2.3 mm voxel size, and contained 32 volumes
with non-collinear diffusion directions and a diffusion weighting of b=1000 s/mm2 and a single b0reference volume. The HARDI scan extended the standard scan with an additional shell of 64
directions at a higher diffusion weighting value (b=2200 s/mm2) to investigate the relative
importance of angular resolution. The scanning was further expedited by applying a multiband factor
of 2.
The HSRDI scan was made at 7T at a higher spatial resolution of 1.4 mm3, and contained the same
number of diffusion-weighted volumes as the standard scan (i.e., 32x b=1000 s/mm2, 1x b=0),
acquired without multiband acceleration. The field-of-view was slightly reduced in the z-direction
(feet-head) to keep scanning time in line with the 3T scans. In order to minimize the distortions that
come with longer readout times when scanning at higher spatial resolution, the field-of-view (FOV)
was reduced in the phase encoding direction, with additional outer volume suppression to prevent
aliasing (Gallichan, 2018; Heidemann, Anwander, Feiweier, Knösche, & Turner, 2012). In order to
correct for distortions during preprocessing, b0-reference volumes with opposite phase encoding
polarity were also acquired at 3T and 7T.
Diffusion (pre)processing
The raw diffusion data were first converted to nifti before noise filtering with a PCA-based filter
(Veraart et al., 2016), as implemented in MRtrix3 (https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/). Distortion, motion
and eddy current correction was subsequently performed with FSL’s (FMRIB’s Software Library,
version 5.0.10; https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) TOPUP and eddy_cuda (gpu version of eddy) tools
(Andersson, Graham, Zsoldos, & Sotiropoulos, 2016; Andersson & Sotiropoulos, 2015). Finally, the
data was corrected for Gibbs’ ringing artifacts with an in-house developed Matlab (The Mathworks,
Natick, MA; version R2017a) script. The preprocessed diffusion data were fit with a diffusion tensor
model for visual inspection (see Figure 1), and with FSL’s Bedpostx, a ball-and-stick model capable of
modelling multiple diffusion orientations per voxel (Behrens, Berg, Jbabdi, Rushworth, & Woolrich,
2007), for tractography analysis.

Figure 1. Comparison of coloured fractional anisotropy maps between the four datasets (standard,
HARDI, HSRDI, and DS, respectively) in native diffusion space for one participant. Note that the
slices are not exactly at the same location and orientation because of differences in acquisition
parameters and participant position in the scanner. The difference between the HSRDI and the
HARDI scans is immediately apparent, whereas the differences between the standard and HARDI
scans are more subtle. The HSRDI scan shows more anatomical detail and suffers less from partial
voluming, resulting in increased distinction between separate directions. The HARDI is less noisy
and looks cleaner than the baseline scan due to the additional volumes. The DS dataset appears
very similar to the standard acquisition.
Down-sampled dataset
To ensure that eventual differences between the HSRDI dataset and standard are not caused by field
strength, we additionally performed tractography in a down-sampled 7T dataset (hereafter ‘DS’). The
HSRDI dataset was down-sampled to match the spatial resolution of the other datasets after
denoising and Gibbs ringing correction, since the correction tools recommend not using interpolated
data. Further processing was identical for all datasets.
Tractography analysis
Rigid co-registrations between diffusion and and structural space were performed with SPM
(statistical parametric mapping, version 12; https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) based on the
fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and T1-scans, and visually inspected. Tractography seeds for the ATR
and slMFB were drawn in the anterior thalamic nucleus and ventral tegmental area, respectively,
with an additional waypoint in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, according to Coenen et al.
(2012). The seeds were subsequently transformed to diffusion space. Probabilisitc tractography was
performed with FSL’s Probtrackx between the seed and waypoint for both bundles bilaterally (default
settings). The tract reconstructions were transformed to structural space and resliced to 1 mm
isotropic resolution, after which they were visually assessed. See Figure 2 for a tractography example
of the ATR and slMFB.

Figure 2. Three-dimensional tractography overview of the ATR (red) and slMFB (blue) on top of a
structural MR image. In the ventral ALIC (as indicated by the lines), the slMFB runs lateral to the
ATR. Towards the prefrontal cortex, the bundles are more intermixed, as they branch out and
connect to adjacent prefrontal structures. The diffusion data in this figure were acquired to the
HSRDI protocol.
Comparison of tract probability profiles and statistical analysis
We compared the separability of the ATR and slMFB in the anterior limb of the internal capsule per
sequence. In order to preserve the spatial information of each individual, we performed the
tractography analysis in subject space. To compare tract probability profiles across subjects and DWI
sequences, we quantified their separability. This was done in the coronal plane, which is oriented
approximately perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis orientations of the ATR and slMFB
(Coenen et al., 2012). For each individual, the target area for DBS was identified in the vALIC on the
T1-weighted scan. Along the line on the medial-lateral axis through this target area, normalized track
probability profiles of the ATR and slMFB were computed, as shown in Figure 3. We calculated the
mean standardized difference (MSD) as a measure of bundle separability, which is defined as the
distance between the two peaks divided by the average standard deviation (full width at half max,
FWHM). Five adjacent lines per hemisphere were averaged to improve robustness of this measure.
Finally, we performed a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in Matlab (fitrm), with
Greenhouse Geisser non-sphericity correction when necessary, to assess possible differences
between the three scans (standard, HARDI, and HSRDI). In case of significant differences, we
calculated pairwise differences post-hoc with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (ttest).

Figure 3. (A) Co-registered tractography results of the ATR (red) and slMFB (blue) for all four
datasets (rows) and (B) corresponding tract probability profiles for one subject. Since tract
probabilities have arbitrary scaling, there may be slight differences in bundle appearance due to
differences in thresholding. Tractography results for the standard, HARDI, and DS sequences are
quite similar in shape and size, with the HARDI tracts being slightly more voluminous than the
baseline. In contrast, the HSRDI tracts appear much narrower and seem to fit the white matter
anatomy better. This is also reflected in the tract probability profiles, which show that the peak-topeak distance does not vary by much between the sequences, although there is a visual difference
between the bundle widths.
Results
Data collection of two participants could not be completed at 3T, as a result of technical issues;
furthermore, one participant withdrew and was not scanned at 7T. These participants were excluded
from the analysis to yield 16 complete datasets. We were able to reconstruct the slMFB and ATR
bilaterally for all DWI sequences in every participant except one, for whom the inferior part of the
slMFB was outside of the HSRDI scan’s field of view. In order to keep the groups balanced, we
excluded the other scans from this participant from further analysis. Therefore, the final analysis
consisted of 45 DWI scans of fifteen participants (mean age = 32 8 years, 5 females). An overview of
all tractography results of can be found in Supplementary Figure 1.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of MSD’s between the ATR and slMFB stratified by scan protocol. It
can be seen that the HSRDI protocol yielded a higher average MSD than the standard protocol (41%

average increase), whereas the HARDI protocol yielded a lower average MSD than the standard
protocol (29% average decrease). The DS dataset performed similar to the standard dataset in all
aspects. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in MSD
between groups (F(3,42) = 19.4, p = 10-5). Further assessment of pairwise differences (corrected for
multiple comparisons) demonstrated that the MSD of the HSRDI sequence was significantly larger
than the other datasets (HSRDI-vs-standard t(14) = 3.6, p = 0.01; HSRDI-vs-HARDI: t(14) = 6.2, p = 104
; HSRDI-vs-DS: t(14) = -8.3, p < 10-5). The MSD was also significantly higher for the standard dataset
compared to the HARDI scan (HARDI-vs-standard: t(14) = 4.2, p 0.01).

To investigate whether the difference in MSD between sequences was caused by alterations in peakto-peak distances between the bundles, or by differences in the width of the tract profiles (i.e. the
FWHM), these parameters were also plotted in Figure 4. Repeated-measures ANOVAs showed
significant differences between the FWHM of the ATR (F(3,42) = 39.2, p < 10-11) and MFB (F(3,42) =
59.7, p < 10-14), respectively. Post-hoc assessment of pairwise differences (corrected for multiple
comparisons) found that the HSRDI sequence produced a significantly lower FWHM compared to the
standard and HARDI sequences for the ATR (HSRDI-vs-standard: t(14) = -9.7, p < 10-6; HSRDI-vsHARDI: t(14) = -13.2, p < 10-8) and slMFB (HSRDI-vs-standard: t(14) = 9.7, p < 10-6; HSRDI-vs-HARDI:
t(14) = 13.2, p < 10-7; HSRDI-vs-DS: t(14) = 9.1, p < 10-5). There were also smaller, but still significant,
differences in the FWHM of the standard and DS datasets on one hand and HARDI on the other for
the slMFB (Standard-vs-HARDI: t(14) = -3.5, p = 0.01; DS-vs-HARDI: t(14) = 5.3, p < 10-5). In contrast,
the peak-to-peak distances were very similar between sequences and did not show any significant
differences.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to optimize separability of the ATR and slMFB in the ALIC for specific
targeting of either bundle in prospective DBS studies. We investigated the relative importance of
angular and spatial resolution in diffusion MRI with limited scan time, as is common in clinical
practice. DWI data were acquired according to one standard and two extended scan protocols with,
respectively, increased angular and spatial resolution from a group of healthy volunteers. We
performed probabilistic tractography to reconstruct the ATR and slMFB in all four datasets (i.e. three
acquisitions and one down-sampled dataset). Finally, the mean standardized difference (MSD) was
calculated as a measure of the separability of the ATR and slMFB. The increased spatial resolution
(HSRDI) sequence yielded a significantly larger MSD than the other three datasets, suggesting that it
was better able to separate the two bundles.
The 7T (HRSDI) sequence with increased spatial resolution had better separability due to the smaller
apparent cross-sectional area of the bundles, as there was no statistically significant difference in the
peak-to-peak distances between the ATR and slMFB of all four datasets. Because of reduced partial
voluming at higher spatial resolution at 7T in the plane perpendicular to the bundle trajectory, the
overlap between ATR and slMFB could be reduced, thereby improving the separation of the tracts.
There were no complex fiber crossings that needed to be resolved in the ATR and slMFB bundles
using higher b-values data. It follows that the clinically used b-value of 1000 s/mm2 was sufficient for
accurate tract reconstruction and that increasing spatial resolution benefitted tract reconstruction.
The HARDI sequence actually yielded a small but significant decrease of the MSD compared to the
standard sequence. This can be attributed to the significant increase in bundle cross-sectional area of
the slMFB in the HARDI protocol. We hypothesize that the apparent increase in tract cross-sectional
area originates from the improved sensitivity to diffusion provided by the additional diffusion-shell.
This is supported by our observation (data not shown) that the anisotropic volume fraction of the
diffusion model used for tractography increased throughout the white matter, when adding the
additional shell with a higher b-value. Effectively, this leads to wider tract outlines. Nevertheless, we
have not attempted to quantify the volume of white matter tracts, since quantification of white
matter volume and integrity with tractography is inherently limited (Jeurissen, Descoteaux, Mori, &
Leemans, 2019; Jones & Cercignani, 2010). Still, it remains possible that the apparent tract cross-

sectional area at higher spatial resolutions is more reflective of the actual bundle cross-sectional area
than at lower spatial resolutions.
The debate about optimal angular and spatial resolution in DWI acquisitions for tractography is still
ongoing. Animal experiments suggest that angular and spatial resolution must be balanced
(Calabrese et al., 2014). A later study in the human brain recommended to acquire DWI data at high
angular resolution, since scans at a high angular resolution (obtained by applying strong diffusionweighting gradients along many gradient directions) may help to resolve multiple fiber populations
within each voxel (Vos et al., 2016). Conversely, data acquired at a high spatial resolution may
increase the uniformity of tissue structures within voxels by decreasing the voxel volume, revealing
structure previously unseen (Steele et al., 2017). It is feasible to increase both angular and spatial
resolutions simultaneously, but this leads to increasingly longer scan times that may be unsuitable
for patient studies and clinical use. Therefore, the choice of angular and spatial resolution may well
depend on the white matter bundles being studied (Calabrese et al., 2014).
While high-resolution 7T clinical applications of diffusion MRI exist for DBS (Patriat et al., 2018;
Plantinga et al., 2018), 7T hardware availability is limited. With ongoing developments in acceleration
techniques such as multiband, there is potential for higher spatial resolution acquisitions at 3T.
Moreover, data processing packages have become better able to deal with distorted (Andersson &
Sotiropoulos, 2015) and noisy data (Veraart et al., 2016), allowing to more readily push for higher
spatial resolutions in diffusion acquisitions. Therefore, it should be possible to acquire higher spatial
resolution DWI data for clinical use at 3T.
Challenges in establishing the tracts’ volumes have the added consequence that absolute distance
measurements in tractography suffer from uncertainty (Jones & Cercignani, 2010; Jones, Knösche, &
Turner, 2013). Nevertheless, the relative differences in FWHM and the distance between the
probability profiles give an indication of how well we can distinguish between the ATR and slMFB.
The locations of the peak probabilities of both bundles were consistent between sequences, which is
supportive to the consistency of the ATR and slMFB tract reconstructions. Since the locations of the
peak probabilities were consistent, there were no significant differences in the distances between
tracts per sequence.
Current clinical practice in tractography-assisted surgery often relies on deterministic tractography,
as opposed to probabilistic tractography (Petersen et al., 2016). In deterministic tractography, there
is only one solution for fitting a tractography algorithm to the underlying diffusion MRI data. As a
result, it may appear that there is a sharp transition between two bundles, where in reality the
bundles are likely to overlap (Coizet et al., 2017). Therefore, we calculated the MSD between two
bundles from probabilistic tractography, anticipating that it will provide a more reliable indication of
the suitability of the data for tract delineation.
Limitations
There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the data were acquired at two different field
strengths hindering attribution of the results to spatial or angular resolution alone. Tissue properties
may differ with field strength, such as decreased T2-relaxation times at 7T that require shorter echo
times. Although other parameters than the echo time also varied between the 3T and 7T sequences,
we do not believe that this invalidated our comparison, as it is arguably better to compare sequences

with optimized parameters with each other rather than to copy all parameters between sequences.
Importantly, the diffusion process can be expected to be unaffected by magnetic field strength. In
addition to above arguments, and to fully rule out the effect of field strength on the results, we
down-sampled the 7T dataset and compared it to 3T data at the same resolution. This comparison
showed a remarkable agreement in tractography results, suggesting that our results did not depend
on field strength.
Secondly, the high angular resolution 3T data was not optimized for spatial resolution, since it was
our aim to compare data acquired with clinically used parameters to respectively higher angular and
spatial resolution alternatives. Higher spatial resolutions in high angular resolution diffusion imaging
have been used previously. For instance, data were acquired for the human connectome project
(HCP) at a spatial resolution of 1.5 mm isotropic, even for very high b-values up to b = 10,000 s/mm2
(Setsompop et al., 2013). However, the combination of higher angular and spatial resolutions require
specialist scanner hardware (e.g., stronger gradients and coils with a large number of channels),
which makes these scan parameters difficult to attain in a clinical setting. In this light, the use of
default clinical parameters and clinically attainable scan times in our study facilitates clinical
application.
A third limitation lies in the trade-off between angular and spatial resolution. Many different
parameter combinations exist that increase the angular resolution of a diffusion MRI scan. We
limited ourselves to investigating only one protocol with improved angular resolution. This protocol’s
parameters are common in high angular resolution diffusion imaging, albeit with a lower b-value
than the reported b = 3000 s/mm2 for optimal angular resolution (Tournier, Calamante, & Connelly,
2013). Finally, we have no direct comparison with histological data which could serve as ground truth
in determining the bundles’ true dimensions. Despite these limitations, within the limited timeframe
available to clinical diffusion MRI scanning, and considering the parallel tract orientations within the
vALIC, it seems more advantageous to increase the spatial resolution than the angular resolution for
parallel running tract configurations. At the same time, it is likely that increasing spatial resolution at
the cost of angular resolution is detrimental in crossing tract configurations, since these may require
a higher angular resolution to be resolved. Thus, we limit our recommendation of focusing on spatial
resolution to resolving parallel tracts for DBS planning.
Relevance
This study is relevant to precise delineation of parallel running tracts, such as needed for
tractography-assisted targeting in DBS in the ALIC. These (relatively) simple parallel tract
configurations have received little attention, while it is our experience that even small differences, on
a millimeter scale, in DBS localization can alter treatment efficacy (Liebrand et al., 2019).
Additionally, more precise and selective stimulation may potentially decrease side effects and
prolong battery life. Especially with the advent of so-called directional, or, steering DBS electrodes
(Steigerwald, Matthies, & Volkmann, 2019), which are to an extent able to focus the generated
electric field to one side, there is an increased potential of delivering stimulation to precisely defined
neuroanatomical structures. Therefore, we aim to implement a higher spatial resolution diffusion
MRI scan for pre-surgical vALIC DBS planning for clinical practice.

We conclude that, within a limited amount of scanning time, it is more beneficial to increase the
spatial than the angular resolution to be able to precisely discern the slMFB and ATR in the vALIC, as
is required for tract-specific DBS. This is primarily caused by the smaller cross-sectional area of the
tracts found at higher spatial resolution, leading to decreased overlap. Dictated by local anatomy, our
protocol advice deviates from general recommendations to aim for high angular resolution to resolve
crossing fibers. Our work thereby allows for increased precision of tract-specific DBS targeting in the
vALIC by increasing the spatial resolution of the diffusion MRI scans. Furthermore, it encourages
researchers and clinicians to optimize the scanning protocol to the specific anatomy and application
at hand.
