Summary

What is already known on this topic:
English national guidance recommends the use of a high-intensity statin, capable of reducing LDL
(low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by 40% or more. Adherence at the time of guideline release
was low, but has not been documented since.
What this study adds​:
Adherence is improving, but breaches of national guidance remain common, with 45% of
prescriptions below the recommended strength, and there is very substantial variation between
practices. Some practices have exhibited rapid positive change in prescribing, which indicates that
better adherence could readily be achieved. We have produced a live data tool allowing anyone to
explore any practice’s current statin prescribing behaviour.

Abstract

Objectives: We set out to describe trends and
variation in statin prescribing in England that
breaches
2014
national
guidance
on
“high-intensity” statins. We identify factors
associated with breaching; and assess the
feasibility of rapid prescribing behaviour change.
Design, Setting and Participants: ​Retrospective
cohort study in NHS primary care in England,
including all 8,142 standard general practices
from August 2010 to March 2019.
Main Outcome Measures: We categorised
statins as high or low/medium-intensity based on
two different thresholds, and calculated the
proportion prescribed below these thresholds
across all practices. We plotted trends and
geographical variation, carried out mixed effects
logistic
regression
to
identify
practice
characteristics
associated
with breaching
guidance, and used indicator saturation to
identify practices exhibiting sudden changes in
prescribing.
Results: We included all 8,142 practices across
the study period. The proportion of statin
prescriptions below the recommended 40%

LDL-lowering threshold decreased gradually
since 2012 from 80% to 45%; the proportion below
a pragmatic 37% threshold decreased from 30% to
18%. The 2014 guidance had minimal impact on
these trends. We found wide variation between
practices (interdecile ranges 20% to 85% and 10%
to 30% respectively in 2018). Mixed effects
logistic regression did not identify practice
characteristics
strongly
associated
with
breaching
guidance.
Indicator
saturation
identified several practices exhibiting sudden
changes in prescribing towards greater guideline
compliance.
Conclusions: Breaches of English guidance on
choice of statin remain common, with substantial
variation between GP practices. Some practices
and regions have implemented rapid change,
indicating the feasibility of rapid prescribing
behaviour change. We discuss the potential for a
national strategic approach, using data and
evidence to optimise care, including targeted
education alongside audit and feedback to
outliers
through
services
such
as
OpenPrescribing.

Introduction
Statins are very widely used to control
serum cholesterol and reduce the risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD), with up to 7
million of the UK population (64.6 million)
taking them in 2014 ​[1]​. This makes statins
the most commonly prescribed class of drugs
in England, with 72.5 million prescriptions
costing over £200m dispensed during 2017
[2,3]​. The 2014 guidance on lipid
modification by the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ​[4]
recommends the use of a high-intensity
statin, capable of reducing LDL (low-density
lipoprotein) cholesterol by 40% or more ​[5]​.
This recommendation was made on the basis
that higher intensity treatment offers
substantially
greater
reduction
in
cardiovascular risk, at similar risk and cost.
Similar guidelines are in place across many
other
countries.
The
high-intensity
treatment options available in the UK are:
atorvastatin 20mg and above; simvastatin
80mg; and rosuvastatin 10mg and above.
Fluvastatin is medium-intensity at its
highest dose; and pravastatin is low-intensity
at all doses.
Two retrospective analysis studies carried
out in UK patient-level datasets indicate that
a huge shift in treatment would be required
to meet the new recommendations: in 2013,
only 24% of patients with CVD were
receiving high-intensity statins ​[6]​; and in
2014, 31% of patients with atherosclerotic
CVD received high-intensity statin, with 21%
not receiving statins at all ​[7]​. This second
study also noted that only 6% of these CVD
patients were receiving statin therapy fully
in line with the new guidelines for secondary
prevention
(atorvastatin
80
mg
or
equivalent); similarly, for patients in the high
risk category for CVD, only 15% were on

high-intensity statins (minimum atorvastatin
20mg or equivalent).
Our group runs OpenPrescribing.net, an
online service that gives free and open access
to monthly prescriptions data and charts
describing various treatment choices at every
general practice in England, with over
130,000 unique users during the past year.
This service includes a standard “audit and
feedback” measure that describes the
prescribing of low/medium-intensity statins,
as a proportion of all statin prescribing, at
each practice (​link​). We were concerned to
note, anecdotally, that breaches of NICE
guidance on statin prescribing were
extremely prevalent. We therefore set out to
describe trends and variation in the
proportion of all statin prescribing in
English primary care that breaches this
guidance; to identify factors associated with
breaching; and to assess the feasibility of
prescribing
behaviour
change
by
ascertaining whether there were individual
practices that had rapidly implemented
substantial changes.
Methods
Study design: ​A retrospective cohort study
of statin prescribing behaviour using
routinely collected primary care prescribing
data. Outcomes were not pre-specified.
Setting: NHS primary care in England,
including all standard general practices with
statin prescriptions dispensed from August
2010 to March 2019.
Data sources: ​Monthly practice-level data
on all items prescribed in NHS primary care
in England and dispensed in the community
is published by the NHS Business Services
Authority (BSA). We used data from
OpenPrescribing.net, which imports this
data, alongside various other datasets giving
practice characteristics, as previously

described ​[8,9]​. National prescribing data
record the number of items of each
individual drug presentation prescribed by
every practice in England, for every month
since August 2010 ​[10]​. Prescribing activity
for each drug presentation is measured as
the number of ​items (corresponding to the
number of prescriptions dispensed) and
quantity
(the
total
number
of
tablets/millilitres etc). Treatment duration
and dosing regimen cannot strictly be
ascertained, but statin treatment is typically
a single tablet once a day, meaning that
tablet strengths are an appropriate surrogate
for statin dose.
Data processing: ​We extracted all available
monthly data from August 2010 to March
2019 inclusive for all statins (Appendix 1).
We restricted our analysis to standard
general practices (setting code “4”),
excluding atypical settings such as prisons
and out-of-hours services, using NHS Digital
organisation data ​[11]​. For analysis of current
prescribing, we restricted data to 2018. We
obtained the number of patients registered
per practice from NHS Digital ​[12]​. We
classified statins according to their strength,
with all tablets of rosuvastatin <10mg,
atorvastatin <20mg and simvastatin <80mg
classed as low and medium-intensity
according to NICE guidelines, and we also
implemented a more pragmatic classification
based on a statin intensity threshold of 37%,
where Rosuvastatin 5mg, Atorvastatin 10mg
and Simvastatin 40mg were grouped with the
high-intensity formulations (BNF codes in
Appendix 1). When using quantity we
excluded liquid and other non-tablet
formulations.
National trends: ​Across all practices we
summed the total statin items prescribed per
month, the proportion of which were of low
and medium-intensity, and the rate of low

and medium-intensity statins prescribed per
1,000 registered patients, and plotted these
as time trends charts.
CCG-level variation: ​Every practice
belongs to a regional clinical commissioning
group (CCG), which typically contain 20-100
practices. We calculated the proportion of
low and medium-intensity statin prescribing
for each CCG in 2018, and displayed the
results as choropleth maps.
Practice-level variation: ​We calculated the
prescribing rate per 1,000 registered patients
in each practice for all statins, and for each
of the main subgroups. We displayed the
data as deciles and centiles on time trends
charts. We repeated this for the proportion
of statin items prescribed in low and
medium-intensity formulations, and for the
proportion of all statin tablets (quantity)
prescribed as specific atorvastatin and
simvastatin formulations (all presentations
which were not tablets or capsules were
excluded).
Logistic regression: We created a mixed
effects logistic regression model to assess
the factors associated with a practice
prescribing higher proportions of low and
medium-intensity statins in 2018. The fixed
effect variables, selected ​a priori on the basis
of clinical interest and data availability, were
as follows: proportion of patients registered
aged over 65; proportion of patients with a
long-term health condition; index of
multiple deprivation; Quality Outcomes
Framework (QOF) score ​[13]​; practice list
size (NHS Digital); and rural/urbanness of
practice postcode ​[14]​. Practices with
missing data were dropped from that part of
the analysis. Continuous variables were
categorised into quintiles to allow for
nonlinearity of effects and to improve the
intelligibility of results. We also included
CCG as a random effect to assess the extent

to which CCG membership explained
variation in prescribing behaviour. The main
outcome
used
was
lowand
medium-intensity statin prescriptions as a
proportion of all statin prescriptions. This
proportion was transformed using a
conditional logit transformation ​[15]​. This
can be conceived of as a logistic regression
analysis where each prescription written by
each GP is a binary choice to give either
compliant or non-compliant treatment. The
model was used to calculate odds ratios and
95% confidence intervals (CI) for each of the
fixed effect variables, as well as an R-squared
value (along with the significance level) to
describe the degree of variance associated
with CCG membership.
Practices that have changed quickly: ​In order
to identify practices that had changed their
statin dose prescribing behaviour rapidly, we
calculated the proportion of low- and
medium-intensity statin prescribing, for
each month, for each practice. Using these
practice-level time series, we applied our
previously described indicator saturation
method ​[16]​, to detect the timing, slope and
magnitude of changes in prescribing. From
these results, we then filtered to find
practices that had a large total change and
those with a rapid slope of change. Examples
of rapidly changing practices were plotted on
a line graph.

Results
Study population:
All 8,142 standard general practices in
England were included across the whole
time period. In 2018 there were 7,210,
organised into 195 local CCGs.
National trends:
The overall rate of prescribing of statins
in England has increased, from around 85-90
items per thousand patients per month in
2011/12 to around 100 items in 2018/19, but
with the rate of increase slowing over time
(Figure 1a). Low and medium-intensity
statins, using the NICE criteria of 40%
reduction in LDL cholesterol, consistently
made up 80% of statin prescriptions in
2011-12; this decreased steadily from late
2012 at a rate of 5.4 percentage points per
year, approaching 45% of all statin
prescriptions in 2019 (Figure 1b). The
proportion of statins prescribed in
formulations giving <37% reduction is also
consistently declining, from a peak of 30% in
2013 to 18% in 2019. eFigure 1 shows the
time trends in the most common
formulations of statins as a proportion of all
statin prescribing across England. Notably,
prescribing of atorvastatin 10mg, 20mg and
40mg and simvastatin 20mg underwent a
sharp increase in 2012, coinciding with a
rapid reduction in simvastatin 40mg.
Thereafter, prescribing of high-intensity
atorvastatin (20mg-80mg) increased, while
atorvastatin 10mg levelled off and all
simvastatin
declined,
including
the
high-intensity form (80mg).

proportion of statin items prescribed which were of low and medium-intensity, including both intensity thresholds.
Vertical line indicates release of NICE guidance, July 2014.

CCG-level variation in statin prescribing:
Among England’s local practice groups,
CCGs, the proportion of statins prescribed
in low intensity formulations in 2018 ranged
widely, from approximately 25-65%, or 7-31%
under the 37% threshold (Figure 2). There
was little notable geographic clustering,
except that the lowest figures (closest to
NICE recommendations) are in central
London and one northern region (Bradford
area).
Practice-level variation in statin prescribing:
The national decline in the proportion of
low and medium-intensity statin items since
2012 was reflected across all deciles at the
level of individual GP practices, but variation
between practices increased slightly over
time (Figure 3a).

Nonetheless, in 2018, 10% of practices still
prescribed more than 60% of statins in these
low and medium-intensity forms, with only a
small percentage of practices achieving 20%
or less (Figure 3a). Compared to the
proportion, the decline in absolute
prescribing rate per 1000 population has
been less pronounced (Figure 3b), and with
very wide variety in performance: in 2018
10% of practices prescribed 25 or fewer per
1000 patients per month; while the top 10%
prescribed at least 80. For comparison, the
monthly prescribing rate for all statins
interdecile range was 50 to 160 (eFigure 2a).
For statins below the 37% threshold, the level
of variation has narrowed, with interdecile
range in the proportion prescribed reducing
from almost 30% to less than 20% (Figure 3c).

Practices that have changed quickly
Although the overall national change in
the use of low and medium-intensity statins
was slow, at 5.4 percentage point reduction
in proportion per year (Figure 1b), our
indicator saturation method for detecting
practices with sudden rapid change found a
large number of GP practices demonstrating
very rapid changes in preferred treatment
choice. For example, since 2014, there were
96 practices with a change of >5 percentage
points per month amounting to a total
change of >25 percentage points. These
practices were distributed amongst 57 CCGs.
Some examples of the practices with the
quickest changes are illustrated in Figure 4.

Regression
We modelled the practice factors
associated with the proportion of low- and
medium-intensity statin prescribing in 2018
(Table 1). In the multivariable regression,
very few of the variables had a substantial
association with prescribing of low- and
medium-intensity
statins.
The
only
meaningful association was with patient age,
where practices with the highest proportion
of patients over the age of 65 were slightly
more likely to prescribe a greater proportion
of low- and medium-intensity statins
(multivariable odds ratio for youngest vs
oldest: 1.22, 95% CI 1.17-1.28).

(<40%) prescribing over the latest five years. Vertical line indicates release of NICE guidance, July 2014.

All other factors had odds ratios close to 1
(range 0.84 to 1.03). The CCG to which a
practice belongs (as a random effect) was
significantly associated with high-dose
prescribing (p <0.0001) and accounted for
25.7% of the variation in low- and
medium-intensity statin prescribing. 350
practices
were
excluded
from
the
multivariable analysis due to missing data.
Discussion
Summary
English national guidance recommends
the use of high-intensity statins. Breaches of
this guidance in primary care are becoming
less prevalent but remain extremely
common, with substantial variation between
practices. Using NICE criteria of treatments
giving a 40% reduction in LDL cholesterol to

identify breaches, low and medium-intensity
statins fell from 80% of all statin
prescriptions in 2011-12, to 45% in 2019, at a
rate of 5.4 percentage points per year. The
proportion of statins prescribed in
formulations giving <37% LDL reduction (the
more permissive criteria for breaching
guidance) also fell, from a peak of 30% in
2013 to 18% in 2019. The NICE guidance
released in 2014 had minimal impact on
these trends. There was very substantial
variation in prescribing behaviour between
practices, with an interdecile range of
20-85% for NICE criteria, and 10-30% for the
<37% LDL criteria. We found several
examples of GP practices exhibiting a rapid
change in prescribing behaviour towards
greater guideline compliance, demonstrating
that such changes are readily deliverable.

Strengths and weaknesses
A major strength is that our data covers
almost the entire population of England,
thus minimising the potential for obtaining a
biased sample. We used real prescribing and
reimbursement data which are sourced from
pharmacy claims and include all dispensed
medication: these therefore did not need to
rely on surrogate measures. Furthermore,
these records are highly accurate, as this
determines the flow of money from
healthcare organisations to pharmacy
businesses. While prescriptions issued by a
hospital clinic or private practice or
dispensed in hospital are not included in our
data, the overwhelming majority of statin
prescriptions are issued through a general
practice. An additional strength of our study
is that we examined both the NICE cut-off
point of 40% reduction, and a more
permissive cut-off of 37%, to account for the
likely circumstance that GPs would
prioritise changing the medication of
patients whose current statin treatment
substantially
breaches
current NICE
guidance.
We used the proportion of statins in
breach of guidance, rather than the absolute
number of breaching prescriptions per head
of local population, to account for
confounding by indication, or variation in
the number of people in each practice who
are eligible for and treated with statins.
There will be some situations where patients
are prescribed lower intensity statins
appropriately, as per the exceptions set out
in the guidance: for example due to
intolerance or perceived intolerance of
higher doses ​[4]​. However, such intolerance
is relatively uncommon ​[17,18]​, and certainly
less prevalent than the prescribing of low
and medium-intensity statins identified in
our data. Furthermore, it is very highly

unlikely that the variation in prevalence of
intolerance could be on the scale of the
variation in prescription of low and
medium-intensity statins we observed
between practices, especially given the very
high numbers involved. This could be
assessed by interrogating richer electronic
health record (EHR) data: however, in our
clinical and analytic experience, concerns
regarding statin intolerance are unlikely to
be recorded consistently as structured data;
and in any case there is no national EHR
dataset covering all NHS GP practices in
which to conduct such an analysis.
Findings in Context
Our findings on the prevalence of
high-intensity prescribing are consistent
with previous work on smaller populations at
single time-points in UK patient-level
datasets. For example, it was found that prior
to guideline release, 24% of CVD and
high-risk patients, and 31% of patients with
vascular disease, received high-intensity
statins ​[6,7]​. Among CVD patients initiating
statins between 2010-2013, only around 2%
were started on low-intensity statins (<29%
LDL reduction), 74% “moderate” intensity
(27-43% reduction, including atorvastatin
20mg) and 23% on high-intensity (>42%
reduction) ​[19]​. Consistent with this, our data
showed approximately 70-75% of statins
were low and medium-intensity in 2014. Our
study also revealed that usage of low and
medium-intensity statins was already
dropping prior to release of the 2014
guidelines, and has continued to do so.
Our findings are mirrored by previous
work from outside the English health
system, although our approach covers a
wider number of patients and clinical
scenarios. In the US, similar guidelines were
released
in
2013
recommending
a

high-intensity (>50% LDL reduction) for
many
eligible
patients,
and
moderate-intensity (30-50%) for some
subgroups ​[20]​. A study across 161 cardiology
practices identified a subsequent small
increase in higher-intensity statin use,
continuing a pre-existing trend ​[21]​. Further,
another study including 140,000 US patients
eligible for secondary prevention found that
guideline adherence was strongly associated
with geography, indicating that local policy
or culture plays an important role ​[22]​. Low
levels of high-intensity statin usage have also
been reported across Europe and worldwide,
with a substantial proportion of patients not
achieving target cholesterol levels ​[23,24]​.
Previous work has shown that doctors
tend to respond rapidly to safety concerns
around prescribing, while evidence‐based
guidelines have less impact, even when the
prescribing advice is clear ​[25,26]​. Our results
support this, showing both a slow change in
response to the 2014 guidelines on effective
dosage, and a rapid change in late 2012
coinciding with an MHRA drug safety alert.
This alert restricted the maximum dose of
simvastatin to 20mg when used with two
commonly prescribed medicines for CVD,
amlodipine or diltiazem. Our data indicate
that this caused a rapid reduction in
simvastatin 40mg, with corresponding
increases in simvastatin 20mg and
atorvastatin. This followed an earlier alert on
simvastatin
80mg due to potential
side-effects
as
well
as
some
contraindications for simvastatin ​[27]​.
Cost also appears to be a contributing
factor in statin choice. Despite earlier
evidence for the greater effectiveness of
atorvastatin over simvastatin, it was not
recommended widely in the NHS until its
patent expired in 2012. Subsequently, the
cost reductions from 2012 appear to have

further increased atorvastatin use and
reduced the use of simvastatin. The final
high-intensity statin to come off patent was
rosuvastatin in 2018. Its generally low usage
over the study period is reflective of this
high cost, and consistent with the NICE
recommendations to use the statin with the
lowest acquisition cost.
In a recent observational analysis, each
10% increase in intensity (eg, 30% to 40%)
gave a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95)
for cardiovascular events in CVD patients
initiated on statins from 2010-2013 and
followed up to the end of 2016 ​[19]​. A
combination of prescribing suboptimal
statins and imperfect adherence (21%
combined measure) led to 23.7 additional
events per 1000 patient-years above the 48.3
predicted with perfect treatment (50%
combined measure) ​[19]​.
Policy Implications and Interpretation
The shortcomings in clinical practice that
we have identified are likely to have a
substantial negative impact on patient care.
All patients with >10% ten-year risk of CVD
are to be offered statins under NICE
guidance ​[4]​. If we conservatively assume an
average 15% ten-year risk of a cardiovascular
event for the total population taking statins
then, as per the NICE risk calculator, with
the recommended treatment of atorvastatin
20mg, their ten-year risk would reduce to 9%
[28]​. In other words, for every 1,000 patients
treated with a high-intensity statin, 90
events would be expected over a ten-year
period, compared to 150 if untreated, with 60
events prevented. Conservatively assuming a
relative risk reduction of 33% for lower
potency statins, only 50 events would be
prevented in the same population of 1,000
patients at 15% ten year risk. We can
therefore estimate that there will be ten

inappropriately given a lower potency statin.
Our
indicator-saturation
change
detection algorithm identified a large
number of individual GP practices that
exhibited a very rapid change in their statin
prescribing to comply with national
guidance on using higher potency statins,
thus demonstrating that such changes can be
- and are - readily implemented. Supporting
this, we found the highest rates of optimal
statin prescribing in central London and
Bradford, which both have long-standing
programmes to promote better statin
prescribing, supported by bespoke local
clinical guidance, software tools, and
incentive schemes ​[29–31]​. In Scotland,
numerous
interventions
have
been
implemented to optimise statin prescribing,
and it was reported that the proportion of
atorvastatin prescribed in low doses
decreased from 62.8% in 2001 to 19.7% in
2015 ​[32]​. This all demonstrates that
implementation of the NICE guidance to use
higher intensity statins is readily achievable.
Having demonstrated that a substantial
change in statin prescribing is necessary,
important, and feasible, there is an
outstanding question of how it can be
achieved. We suggest that a national
strategic approach is required, using data to
identify outliers, and offering them feedback
and targeted educational interventions.
Audit and feedback alone has already been
shown to be modestly effective at changing
clinical practice ​[33]​. We provide a free
online data monitoring tool for anyone to see
the current prescribing of high potency
statins - and indeed all medicines - at any
individual NHS general practice in England,
through OpenPrescribing.net.

More broadly our findings and policy
recommendations speak to a more general
theme: the better use of existing low-cost
techniques and interventions to improve
clinical care. “Big data”, machine learning
and artificial intelligence are commonly
discussed as a future panacea, developing
novel methods to identify and diagnose
disease,
identifying
new
treatments,
personalising the use of older treatments,
and delivering healthcare services in new
ways; less commonly discussed is that we
already have data and analytical techniques,
readily available today, that are not being
used to identify outliers, implement
guidance and improve care. Similarly, statins
are an effective intervention, at very low
cost, and the most commonly prescribed
class of medication in the UK; and yet they
are often prescribed sub-optimally, as
elsewhere in the world. If we cannot achieve
concordance with the evidence among NHS
clinicians for statins, the most commonly
prescribed class of treatment in the UK, then
there is a great deal of work to be done in
using data and medicines to optimise patient
outcomes.
Future Research
We identify two areas for further
research. Firstly, mixed methods research,
using data such as ours to identify practices
that breach guidance on optimal statin
prescribing, and realist evaluation or other
qualitative methods to understand the
reasons for this breach. Secondly, the
evaluation of interventions that aim to
improve prescribing: whether low cost, such
as delivering feedback on clinical practice; or
high cost, such as targeted educational
interventions for breaching clinicians.

Summary
Wide variation in high intensity statin
prescribing exists across England, contrary
to national guidance. Some regions have
effectively implemented action to achieve
good compliance while others lag behind. A
national strategic approach on using data
and evidence to optimise care is needed.
