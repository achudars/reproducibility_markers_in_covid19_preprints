Abstract
This paper presents a procedure for the patient-specific prediction of epileptic seizures. To this end, a
combination of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and smooth basis functions with robust
regression is applied to power spectra of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals. The
resulting time and frequency components capture the dominant information from power spectra, while
removing outliers and noise. This makes it possible to detect structure in preictal states, which is used
for classification. Linear support vector machines (SVM) with L1 regularization are used to select and
weigh the contributions from different number of not equally informative channels among patients. Due
to class imbalance in data, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is applied. The
resulting method yields a computationally and conceptually simple, interpretable model of EEG signals
of preictal and interictal states, which shows a good performance for the task of seizure prediction.

Introduction

1

The ability to predict epileptic seizures provides an opportunity to intervene in order to attenuate their
effects, or if possible prevent them. In this study we focus on EEG manifestations of seizures, which are
characterized by sudden hypersynchronization of neurons and last from seconds to minutes. [1] Recently
published studies on seizure prediction use a wide variety of approaches, from time series analysis (e.g.
phase synchronization [2]) and spectral features of EEG signals [3] to physiological models of neural
activity (e.g. neural mass models [4]). We focus on spectral measures of EEG signals since they have
been successfully used as features for seizure prediction, and are easily interpretable. [3, 5, 6]
In the field of seizure prediction there are certain conceptional, computational and data-related
challenges. First, using a large number of features for prediction makes it difficult to interpret their
individual contribution. [6] Secondly, the algorithms for seizure prediction in a clinical setting need to be
computationally efficient. Due to hardware constraints, this applies to closed-loop EEG devices for
seizure prediction and intervention in particular, which have been a recent focus in the field. [5–7]
Finally, data encountered in the field of seizure prediction can be high dimensional and heterogeneous
(e.g. recorded using many different channels and types of measurements in addition to EEG, like ECG,
EOG etc), yet suffer from class imbalance (patients spend more time in interictal than in preictal states)
and limited in the number of labeled samples. This is particularly challenging for the design of a
patient-specific model.
In this study we address these issues by developing an easy-to-use, computationally efficient method
for patient-specific seizure prediction. In order to achieve that, we extract a small set of interpretable
features from power spectra that distinguish a baseline (interictal) EEG activity from a state leading up
to a seizure (preictal state). Interictal states are regular brain activity between seizures, which can
sometimes be interrupted with interictal spiking. [1, 8] Since seizures are characterized by strong
synchronization, they are very prominent in power spectra of EEG signals. Although preictal states are

not clearly visible in raw EEG signals, multiple studies confirmed the presence of distinct preictal states
using spectral [3, 9, 10], as well as information measures. [11–13] For a detailed discussion, see [5] and [6].
Although power spectra capture relevant changes in frequency over time, they can be very noisy and
contain outliers. We thus use nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) [14, 15] to decompose power
spectra into dominant time and frequency components, which are later used for seizure prediction.
To mitigate class imbalance, we employ synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) [16],
together with linear SVM with L1 regularization, to assign weights for contributions from each individual
channel and eliminate uninformative channels. The developed method is computationally inexpensive
and produces good results while providing insights into the structure of preictal states.

Data preparation

The data consists of heterogeneous EEG recordings of six patients (two females; median age: 33) [Tab.1]
and form a part of the bigger Freiburg EPILEPSIAE database. [17] Recordings were made at the
University Medical Center Freiburg, over the course of several days (three to nine), between 2003 and
2009. The sampling frequency varies between 256Hz and 1024Hz. The electrodes that are used in the
recordings include intracranial (depth, strip and grid) and surface electrodes, together with special
electrodes (e.g. ECG, EMG and EOG), whose number varies between 31 and 122, depending on the
diagnosis. In order to investigate preictal states thoroughly, only intracranial EEG recordings are used.
Since the ability to predict a seizure five minutes before its onset can be useful for patients with
uncontrolled epilepsy [18], we focus on five minute intervals of preictal and interictal states. In the case
of a preictal state, an interval of five minutes leading up to a seizure is extracted. Since preictal states
directly precede seizures, seizure prediction can be realized by classification between preictal and
interictal states.
In the case of an interictal state five minutes intervals are extracted, which are at least 11 minutes
before or after any other seizure. We refer to these intervals of extracted signals as individual
measurement periods. The data are filtered with the Parks-McClellan optimal equiripple finite impulse
response filter to remove 50Hz line noise.
The dataset is separated into training (70%) and validation set (30%) during a 100-fold
cross-validation procedure.

Deriving time and frequency components
To identify stereotypical behavior between and ahead of seizures, spectrograms of each channel [Fig.1]
are obtained using the multitaper method [19] with time windows of 10 seconds (which is calculated by
using 50% overlap of a 20 seconds window). To correct for baseline activity across frequencies in

interictal states, relative power is calculated by dividing spectrograms of each channel by the respective
average interictal spectrogram.
Due to the clinical setting and patients’ diagnoses, the sampling frequency varies among different
patients. As a result, the highest frequency in the spectrograms varies between 128Hz and 513Hz.
However, this difference is unproblematic due to the fact that we develop patient-specific models. After
obtaining spectrograms of every individual measurement period for every channel, they are visually
inspected, and in the case of anomalies, excluded from the training data. In addition to that, if either
the beginning or end of an individual measurement period is corrupted by e.g. seizure leakage (an onset
of a seizure before a misplaced onset label due to hand-labeling of the raw iEEG signal) or electrode
detachment, then the corrupted data is replaced by a corresponding amount of data from the opposite
end of the measurement interval. In that way, the length of spectrograms is preserved.

spectrogram is similar to the baseline activity. This channel and individual measurement period will be
used throughout the paper for illustrative purposes, if not stated otherwise.

Time-frequency decomposition

69

To examine changes in power spectra, spectrograms of each channel and each individual measurement
period are decomposed into a time and a frequency component using nonnegative matrix factorization.
Originally proposed under the name ”positive matrix factorization”, it is a variant of factor analysis [14],
which was first used on environmental data [20] and later popularized in the application to face
recognition under the current name. [15] For both tasks, NMF is successful in learning interpretable
parts-based representation (e.g. concentrations of elements, as in [20] or parts of faces, as in [15]) and
shown to perform better than independent component analysis, principal component analysis or vector
quantization. [21–23] In the field of seizure prediction, NMF has been used to develop a method for
automatic localization of epileptic spikes in children with infantile spasms [24] and for automatically
detection and localization of interictal discharges. [25]
Nonnegative matrix factorization decomposes a nonnegative matrix V into two nonnegative low-rank
matrices W and H [15]:

of frequencies (frequency component W ). [Fig.2]

(solid blue lines) and frequency components (solid red lines) and their respective models (dashed lines) of
a preictal state (A, C), as well as an interictal state (B, D). In a preictal state, the time component (A)
increases as a seizure is approaching, while the frequency component (C) has a sharp increase in low
frequencies. Both interictal components (B, D) are steady and are an order of magnitude lower than
their respective preictal components (A, C).
To lessen the influence of outliers and to remove noise in the NMF components, they are modeled
with smooth basis functions using robust regression. The time component is modeled by a polynomial of
second order, while the frequency component is modeled by nonlinearly logarithmically spaced B-splines
of sixth order to consider the frequency resolution which decreases in higher frequencies. [Fig.2] By
modeling each component with smooth basis functions, the most relevant information is preserved in
both domains, while noise is removed.
By calculating the outer product of modeled NMF components as shown in figure 3, time-frequency
models can be reconstructed. They capture the most important information while leaving out the noise
and thus provide simplified intermediate representation of the data, which can be visually compared to
the corresponding spectrograms (see S1 Figure in the appendix). The coefficients of the modeled time
and frequency components therefore convey relevant information about structure of both states.

Prediction and performance measures
To classify between preictal and interictal states, linear support vector machines [26] are used. We
combine the coefficients of both of the modeled NMF components across all channels into a feature

vector. For example, recordings of patient 1 contain 48 channels with 12 NMF parameters (9 parameters
for the frequency component and 3 parameters for the time component) each, leading to a dimensionality
of 48 · 12 = 576. To account for the risk of overfitting due to the high number of features, L1
regularization is used, which constrains most of the parameters to zero.
In the original dataset, interictal states are more frequent than the preictal ones, which leads to an
imbalance of classes (c.f. Tab. 1). To account for this class imbalance, the SMOTE oversampling
technique is used, which creates synthetic samples of the minority class based on k neighboring points
(in our case k = 5). [16]
To ensure good generalization of the algorithm, 100-fold cross-validation is used on a training set
(70%) and a validation set (30%). Average measures (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and
negative predictive values) are reported. Since the classifier should neither miss nor falsely predict a
seizure, we report sensitivity sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive
values. [27]

Results and discussion

Interpretability of the model

114

The modeled NMF components show clear differences in preictal and interictal states. [Fig.2] In a
preictal state, the modeled time component shows an increase towards the seizure onset, which is not
visible in an interictal state. Models of the frequency components of preictal states exhibit a peak of high
activity in lower frequencies, relative to baseline activity. Our study thus confirms previous findings of a
structure below 30Hz (gamma range), which is informative for seizure prediction. [9, 10] These structural
differences are also visible in recovered time-frequency models (see S2 Figure and S3 Figure in the
appendix). Even though there are differences between patients in both time and frequency components,
the average components are similar among patients, which confirms the reliable existence of structure in
preictal states (see S4 Figure in the appendix for a comparison).

Predictive performance

Similar accuracy is achieved for all patients (above 90%). The lowest performance is for the patient 5
(92%) and the highest for the patient 4 (100%), as shown in figure 4 and table 2. Sensitivity is between
0.84 and 1, while specificity ranges from 0.98 to 1, as can be seen in figure 4. A combination of high
values of sensitivity and specificity is achieved for all patients. Similarly, positive predictive values are
between 0.98 and 1, while negative predictive values are between 0.87 and 1 (c.f. figure 4 and table 2).

Conclusion

130

Since patients with uncontrolled epilepsy prefer to be advised a few minutes before a seizure onset [18],
we decided to use intervals of five minutes. However, this method is easily extensible to longer periods of
time, since the length of intervals has no effect on dimensionality of modeled time components.
Data from additional patients as well as more data from the same patient could, if available, lead to a
better generalization of the model. This however is a challenge for patient-specific models in general,
where data from a single patient should suffice, and a large number of labeled training examples is not
available.
Overall, this study demonstrates the use of nonnegative matrix factorization of power spectra for a
seizure prediction task. The proposed model is conceptually simple, interpretable and has shown high
accuracy on a representative dataset. A similar approach could be used for similar tasks such as
detection of sleep stages in EEG or the detection of irregularities in ECG.
