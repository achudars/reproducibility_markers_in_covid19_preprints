Abstract
Aims Current risk prediction tools are not accurate enough to identify most individuals at
high coronary risk. On the other hand, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) and
miRNAs are actively involved in atherosclerosis. Our aim was to examine the association
of ox-LDL-induced miRNAs with coronary artery disease (CAD), and to assess their
predictive capacity of future CAD.
Methods and results Human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells were treated
with oxidized or native LDLs (nLDL), and their miRNA expression was measured with the
miRNA 4.0 array, and analyzed with moderated t-tests. Differently expressed miRNAs and
others known to be associated with CAD, were examined in serum samples of 500 acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and 500 healthy controls, and baseline serum of 117
incident CAD cases and c 485 randomly-selected cohort participants (case-cohort). Both
were developed within the REGICOR AMI Registry and population cohorts from Girona.
miRNAs expression in serum was measured with custom OpenArray plates, and analyzed
with fold change (age and sex-paired case-control) and survival models (case-cohort).
Improvement in discrimination and reclassification by miRNAs was assessed.
Twenty-one miRNAs were up- or down-regulated with ox-LDL in cell cultures. One of
them, 1 (has-miR-122-5p, fold change=4.85) was upregulated in AMI cases. Of the 28
known CAD-associated miRNAs, 11 were upregulated in AMI cases, and 1 (hsa-miR-1433p, hazard ratio=0.56 [0.38-0.82]) was associated with CAD incidence and improved
reclassification.
Conclusion We identified 2 novel miRNAs associated with ox-LDLs (hsa-miR-193b-5p
and hsa-miR-1229-5p), and 1 miRNA that improved reclassification of healthy individuals
(hsa-miR-143-3p).

Introduction
Although coronary artery disease (CAD) incidence is decreasing in many European
regions [1,2], both the number of first events in low-risk individuals, and the recurrence
rate after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are still high. In general population without
cardiovascular disease (CVD), cardiovascular prevention strategies depend on the
predicted CVD risk. This risk is calculated with available risk functions, and defines
whether the individual receives lifestyle counselling and/or lipid-lowering and hypertension
treatments [3]. However, the discrimination of the validated European risk functions ranges
between 70-88% [4-8]. This lack of accuracy means that >50% of events occur in
individuals classified as with low/moderate risk, which do not qualify for intensive
prevention strategies [9]. On the other hand, 18-21% of AMI patients have a second CVD
event within 4 years after discharge [10,11]. An improvement in risk prediction in primary
and secondary CVD prevention, could decrease the number of events in low risk
individuals, and the number of recurrent events in MI patients. But improving risk
prediction is not an easy task.
In primary prevention, risk prediction variables have not changed in the last decades.
Attempts to improve risk functions have mainly focused on including genetic and/or
circulating biomarkers, with little impact on their discrimination and calibration capacity [3].
Discovery of other biomarkers could improve risk stratification, and boost the identification
of new biological pathways and therapeutic targets.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. miRNAs allow
temporal regulation of gene expression [12] and control essential processes in
atherosclerosis and after an AMI [13]. In addition, miRNAs are relatively stable and easy to
measure in serum [14].

In the last years, a few studies have identified miRNAs that are associated with better
discrimination of high risk individuals in general population [15] and after an AMI with ST
segment elevation [16]. However, previous studies examined panels of miRNAs without
taking into account key risk factors of the disease. Among the main risk factors, lowdensity lipoproteins (LDLs), particularly in their oxidized status (ox-LDLs), are a causal
determinant of atherosclerosis and CAD [17]. Ox-LDLs induce the expression of adhesion
molecules in endothelial cells (ECs), mediate the inflammatory response, cause
dysfunction and apoptosis of ECs, regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species, and
are involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and apoptosis [18].
In this study we had 3 aims: 1) to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in human ECs
and VSMCs, after exposure to ox-LDLs; 2) to analyze whether the miRNAs associated to
ox-LDLs exposure, and others known to be associated to CAD, were differentially
expressed in MI cases compared to healthy controls; and 3) to determine whether any of
the miRNAs identified in objectives 1 and 2 could aid in predicting 10-year incident CAD in
general population.

Methods
LDL cell treatment study
Human artery collection
ECs and VSMCs derived from healthy human renal arteries, from 3 individuals without
CVD, were obtained from donors of the COLMAH collection
(https://www.redheracles.net/plataformas/en_coleccion-muestras-arterialeshumanas.html). Vessels were divided into two pieces within the first 24h after extraction.
One piece was placed in RNAlater (Ambion) for RNA extraction, and the other in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) for cell isolation.
EC and VSMC isolation
For EC culture, arteries were longitudinally opened, washed with PBS and incubated for
20-25 min with 1% collagenase type I in their endothelial side. Afterwards, ECs present in
the collagenase solution were collected and washed twice with M199 medium containing
20% of fetal bovine serum (FBS). ECs were subsequently grown in 2 µg/ml fibronectin
(Sigma) coated dishes, with human EC-specific medium EBM supplemented with EC
growth factors (EGM-2, Lonza), and kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2. ECs were identified by
their cobblestone morphology.
For VSMC culture, cells were isolated from the medial layer of the vessel after removal of
ECs and the adventitia layer. The medial layer was cut in 1-3 mm pieces that were seeded
in 35 mm Petri dishes treated with 2 % gelatin (Type B from bovine skin, Sigma) in DMEM
with 20% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml each), 5 μg/ml fungizone, and 2 mM Lglutamine (Lonza), and kept at 37 ºC and 5% CO2. Migration and proliferation of VSMCs
from the explants was evident within 7-15 days. Confluent VSMCs were trypsinized,
seeded at 1/3 density, and cultured in control medium (MEM with 5% FBS, penicillin-

streptomycin, fungizone, L-glutamine 5 μg/ml insulin, 2 ng/ml bFGF, and 5 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor [19]).
LDL oxidation and cell treatment
Commercial human LDL (Prospec Pro-562) was diluted to 500 µg/ml in PBS (nLDL) and
incubated with 5 µM CuSO4 for 30min, for moderately oxidized LDL (moxLDL). For highly
oxidized LDL (hoxLDL), nLDL was incubated with 10 µM CuSO4 for 24h. The reaction was
ended adding 200 µM EDTA to prevent further oxidation and then dialyzed (Slide-A-Lyzer
Dialysis Cassete 3.5 MWCO, ThermoFisher 66110). The degree of LDL oxidation was
assessed by measuring conjugated diene formation at 234 nm [20].
ECs and VSMCs at passages 4-8 were incubated with 50 µg/ml of nLDL, moxLDL, or
hoxLDL for 24h. Then, cells were collected with Qiazol Lysis Reagent for RNA extraction.

Case-control study
An age- and sex-matched case-control study of 500 AMI cases and 500 controls was
designed within the REGICOR (REgistre GIroni del COR) Study. Controls were randomly
selected from the participants of a population-based cohort free of CAD symptoms during
a 10-year follow-up. The cohort was recruited in the Girona province, in 2003-2005 [21].
AMI cases were randomly selected from the patients of the REGICOR AMI Registry,
admitted consecutively with q-wave AMI in the reference hospital (Josep Trueta, Girona).
The REGICOR AMI Registry was active during 1990-2009 in the same region as the
REGICOR population cohort [22-24].
CV risk factor data and blood sample collection
The methods to obtain baseline data on CV risk factors for the 2005 REGICOR population
cohort and for the REGICOR AMI Registry, have been detailed elsewhere [21-23]. Briefly,
examinations in the 2005 REGICOR population cohort were performed by trained

personnel using standard questionnaires and measurement methods. Collected/measured
variables included age, sex, height, weight, blood pressure, fasting levels lipid levels (total
cholesterol, triglycerides, and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c, and
LDL-c, respectively]), fasting glycaemia, and diagnosis and treatment of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Blood samples were collected after a 10-14h fasting
and stored at -80ºC. In the REGICOR AMI Registry, the same variables were obtained by
trained personnel from clinical records. Blood samples were collected upon arrival to
hospital and stored at -80ºC.

Case-cohort study
A case-cohort study was designed also within the REGICOR population-cohort recruited in
2003-2005, with all 117 10-year incident CAD events, and a random subsample of the
cohort paired with cases by age and sex (n=483).
Case-finding procedures and case-classification in the REGICOR population-cohort
Participants from the 2005 REGICOR population-cohort were re-examined or interviewed
by telephone when they could not attend the appointment. AMI case investigation in the
REGICOR Registry has been described previously [24]. Events of interest were identified
with medical records and with the Mortality Register of Catalonia to identify fatal CAD
events. Participants were classified as CAD incident cases if they had a discharge record
suggestive of fatal or nonfatal AMI or angina (ICD-9 codes: 410, 411.0, 411.1, 412, 414,
429; and ICD-10 codes: I21-I25, including subtypes). Death certificates with codes 410414 (ICD-9) or I20-I22, I24, and I25 (ICD-10) were selected for review of medical records
and autopsy results. Events were classified by an expert committee following standardized
guideline criteria [25]. Angina was defined according to the presence of symptoms and
objective demonstration of ischemia or presence of coronary stenosis.

RNA extraction and quality control
Total RNA from LDL treated cells was isolated with miRNasey Mini kit (Qiagen) following
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extraction from serum samples, of the case-control and
case-cohort studies, was performed with the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA Isolation kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA spike-in controls ath-miR159a and cell-miR-2 were added
during the RNA extraction process from serum samples.

miRNA expression
LDL cell exposure study
miRNA expression in LDL treated cells was examined using the miRNA 4.0 array (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). RNA samples underwent polyadenylation and biotin-labelling with the
Flash Tag Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit (P/N 703095, Rev.2) (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Biotin-labeled RNA samples were subsequently hybridized for 16h to the GeneChip
miRNA 4.0 arrays, in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640. Arrays were washed and
stained in a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and scanned in a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G,
using the Expression Wash, Stain and Scan User Manual (P/N 702731, Rev.3).
Case-control and case-cohort studies
RNA extracted from serum samples and from LDL treated cells (also examined with the
miRNA array), underwent polyadenylation, adaptor ligation, and reverse transcription with
the Taqman advanced miRNA cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA
samples were combined with the miR-Amp PCR master mix and transferred to a custom
made OpenArray plates with the AccuFill instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Custom
OpenArray plates included 52 miRNAs: 24 identified in the LDL cell treatment study, 22
known to be associated with CAD, and 6 as housekeeping miRNAs (Supplementary
material online, Table S1). OpenArray plates were run on the QuantStudio 12K Flex

instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR amplification curves were examined with the
Thermo Fisher Cloud software for Ct determination and for melting curve analysis.
Observations with an AmpScore >1.1 and for which an exponential curve was present
were included in the analysis.

Statistical analysis
miRNA expression and selection criteria in the LDL cell treatment study
Background correction, normalization, and summarization of expression were performed
with the RMA function of the aroma.affymetrix R package [27]. The RMA function uses a
deconvolution method for background correction, quantile normalization, and the median
polish algorithm for summarization of expression. To obtain differentially expressed
miRNAs, linear models were fit by comparing RMA summarized expression between the
following cell treatment conditions: moxLDL vs nLDL, and hoxLDL vs nLDL. Moderated tstatistics of differential expression were obtained by empirical Bayes moderation of the
standard errors using the limma R package [28]. P-values were adjusted for multiple
comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [29].
miRNAs with a fold change ≥1.5 and a significant unadjusted p-value, in moxLDL vs nLDL
or in hoxLDL vs nLDL, in at least 1 cell type (ECs or VSMCs), were selected for further
analysis based also on the expression trend. The existence of a linear/quadratic trend in
the miRNA expression between the conditions nLDL, moxLDL, and hoxLDL was assessed
with linear models using generalized least squares. Trend p-values were adjusted with the
Benjamini-Hochberg correction. miRNAs with a significant linear or quadratic trend in at
least 1 cell type were selected.

Similarity of miRNA expression obtained with the microarray and the OpenArray, was
assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient of RMA summarized expression and
deltaCt normalized expression values, respectively.
miRNA expression analysis in the case-control and case-cohort studies
miRNAs with >90% of Ct missing values and individuals with >95% of Ct missing values
were excluded from the analysis. miRNAs with <90% of missing Ct values were also
excluded if they did not allow for plate effect correction. Cts were corrected for possible
plate effects with the ComBat function of the sva R package [30]. Global normalization was
performed by subtracting the Ct of each miRNA from the mean Ct of all miRNAs (Delta
Ct).
In the case-control study the fold change was calculated to assess the association of each
miRNA and case-control status. Fold change was defined as the 2^[-(DeltaCT cases –
DeltaCT controls)]. Missing Ct values were censored at the maximum observed value for
each miRNA. Means and p-values were computed with Kaplan-Meier and long rank test,
respectively, to consider censored values.
In the case-cohort study, missing Ct values were removed from the analysis. An age- and
sex- adjusted Cox regression model, taking into account the case-cohort design [31], was
fitted to assess the association of each miRNA and time-to-CAD event. P-values were also
adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The
independent association of the significant miRNAs was examined with a Cox regression
model further adjusted for classical risk factors (age, sex, smoking, cholesterol level, blood
pressure, diabetes).
Predictive capacity of the identified miRNAs
In the case-cohort study, the contribution to the predictive capacity of the significant
miRNAs, over classical risk factors, was analyzed with the C-statistic. The C-statistic was

computed for a model with all classical risk factors, and including or not the most
significant miRNAs identified in the case-control or in the case-cohort study. The increment
of the C-statistic was calculated as previously described for case-cohort studies [32,33].
Reclassification was examined with categorical and continuous Net Reclassification Index
(NRI), and with the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) for the REGICOR CAD risk
function [7]. For the categorical NRI, the cutoff point was 10%, which corresponds to the
high risk category in the REGICOR CAD risk function. NRI and IDI confidence intervals
were obtained by bootstrapping.
Pathway analysis
In the case-control study, gene targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were
obtained from the TargetScanHuman website release 7.2 [34]. Targets with a cumulative
weighted context +++ score < -0.3 and with an aggregate score ≥ 0.3 were selected.
Pathway analysis was performed using the hypergeometric test implemented in the
ReactomePA R package [35]. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the
Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
All statistical analyses were performed with the R software version 3.5.2. [36].

Results
Characteristics of the study participants are presented in Supplementary material online,
(Tables S2-S4).
LDL cell treatment study
There were 21 miRNAs with differential expression that showed a linear or quadratic
significant trend, in ECs or VSMCs, upon treatment with hoxLDL/moxLDL compared to
nLDL (Figure 1, Supplementary material online, Tables S5 and S6). Of the 21 differentially
expressed miRNAs, 4 were identified in both cell types (hsa-miR-3151-5p, hsa-miR-4669,
hsa-miR-6831-5p, and hsa-miR-7107-5p). Hsa-miR-4669 and hsa-miR-6831-5p were
down-regulated upon treatment with hoxLDL/moxLDL in both cell types. On the other
hand, hsa-miR-3151-5p was down-regulated in ECs and upregulated in VSMCs, while
hsa-miR-7107-5p did the opposite. The largest change in expression was observed for
hsa-miR-197-3p in ECs (4 times more expressed in cells treated with nLDL) and for hsamiR-122-5p in VSMCs (2.5 times more expressed in cells treated with hoxLDL).
Validation of miRNA expression in LDL treated cells
The higher the RMA summarized expression obtained with the microarray, the lower the
DeltaCt obtained from the qPCR OpenArray (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
Correlation was significant for all samples (r = -0.475, p-value=1.22e-06) and by cell type
(rEC =-0.36, rVSMC = -0.41, p-value<7e-03). miRNAs with a microarray RMA expression
>3 (54%) were partially validated by qPCR (37%). Five out of 22 miRNAs differentially
expressed in the microarray were detected by qPCR (hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-125a-3p,
hsa-miR-193b-3p, hsa-miR-193b-5p, and hsa-miR-1229-5p).
Case-control study
The analysis included 476 cases and 487 controls (Supplementary material online, Figure
S2) with <95% of missing miRNA Cts, and 14 miRNAs with <75% of missing Ct values. Of

the 14 candidate miRNAs, 12 were differentially expressed -and upregulated- in MI cases
compared to controls (adjusted p-value<0.05) (Figure 2, Supplementary material online,
Table S7). The largest difference in expression was observed for hsa-miR-499a-5p, hsamiR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-133a-3p, which had an expression 118, 10, and 9 times higher,
respectively, in MI cases compared to controls.
TargetScan identified 7953 gene targets for the 12 upregulated miRNAs. Of those, the
ones with higher binding efficacy and conservation (n=1431), were selected for pathway
analysis. The identified targets were significantly associated with 53 pathways
(Supplementary material online, Table S8). The 10 most significantly associated pathways
included tyrosine, MAP kinase, toll like receptor, and cytokine signaling (Figure 3). In each
pathway there were 19-72 gene targets.

Case-cohort study
We analyzed 105 CAD cases and 455 individuals from the cohort (Supplementary material
online, Figure S3), with ≤95% of missing miRNA Cts, and 14 miRNAs with ≤80% of
missing Ct values. Only hsa-miR-143-3p was significantly associated with time-to-CAD
incident events in the age- and sex- adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio=0.56
[95%Confidence Interval (CI) 0.38; 0.82], adjusted p-value=0.003) (Supplementary
material online, Table S9). The association of hsa-miR-143-3p with CAD was independent
of classical risk factors (p-value = 0.008).
The inclusion of the Delta Ct of hsa-miR-143-3p or of the 3 most significant miRNAs in the
case-control study (hsa-miR-499-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-133a-3p), did not improve
discrimination over classical risk factors (Figure 4, C-index). However, hsa-miR-143-3p,
and its combination the 3 case-control miRNAs improved reclassification measures. HsamiR-143-3p improved continuous NRI (46.7% [95%CI 6.5; 88.7], p-value=0.026) and IDI

Discussion
In this study, we identified 21 miRNAs differentially expressed upon treatment with oxLDLs in EC and VSMCs. The miRNAs showing the largest expression change in VSMCs
(hsa-miR-122-5p) was also upregulated in serum samples of MI cases compared to
controls. Another 11 miRNAs, identified from the literature, were upregulated between MI
cases and controls, particularly hsa-miR-499-5p. The predicted targets of the 12
upregulated miRNAs in the case-control study were associated with signaling pathways of
tyrosine kinases, MAP kinases, and toll-like receptors. None of the miRNAs differentially
expressed upon ox-LDL treatment in EC or VSMCs was associated with time-to-incident
CAD event in the case-cohort study. However, hsa-miR-143-3p, a miRNA, known to be
upregulated in AMI cases compared to controls, was independently and inversely
associated with time-to-CAD incident event. The addition of hsa-miR-143-3p to classical
risk factors improved significantly reclassification of population according to their CV risk,
although discrimination remained unchanged.
After treating EC and VSMCs with ox-LDLs, the expression of 21 miRNAs significantly
changed, when compared to nLDL treatment. A few of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-122-5p,
hsa-miR-125a-3p, hsa-miR-193b-3p, hsa-miR-197-3p, hsa-miR-4632, and hsa-miR-71075p), were previously associated with ox-LDL related processes such as lipid metabolism,
reactive oxygen species, and inflammation [37-42]. Of those, we were particularly
interested in hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-125a-3p, and hsa-miR-193b-3p, as they were
validated by qPCR. Hsa-miR-122-5p levels associated with lipoprotein components in
general population, and with cholesterol and triglyceride levels in animal studies [37].
These associations were probably related to the effect of hsa-miR-122-5p on the
regulation of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation [43]. Hsa-miR-125a-3p
was associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and with cholesterol levels in obese

individuals [38]. And hsa-miR-193b-3p was associated with production of reactive oxygen
species in human fibroblasts [39]. Besides validating the association between ox-LDL
related processes and hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-125a-3p, and hsa-miR-193b-3p, we also
identified 2 novel miRNAs associated with ox-LDL treatment: has-miR-193b-5p and hasmiR-1229-5p.
Hsa-miR-122-5p was not only upregulated in VSMCs upon treatment with ox-LDLs, but
also in AMI cases compared to controls. This result adds up to the involvement of the LDL
oxidation pathway in the response after an AMI [44]. In a recent meta-analysis, has-miR122-5p was identified as upregulated in CAD cases compared to controls [45]. In addition,
in hyperlipidemia patients, hsa-miR-122-5p was upregulated, and associated with
presence and severity of CAD [46].
Besides hsa-miR-122-5p, we found 11 other upregulated miRNAs in AMI cases compared
to controls (has-miR-16-5p, has-miR-21-5p, has-miR-22-3p, has-miR-125b-5p, has-miR133a-3p, has-miR-143-3p, has-miR-145-5p, has-miR-146a-5p, has-miR-186-5p, has-miR222-3p, and has-miR-499a-5p). Has-miR-499a-5p was the most upregulated miRNA, with
a 118-fold expression change, an increase similar to that reported by 2 previous studies of
AMI patients [47,48].
In accordance to our results, the 12 overexpressed miRNAs in the case-control study,
were identified as significantly upregulated in individuals with AMI or CAD in previous
studies [45, 49-52], or after cardiac ischaemia in animal models (miR-15 family) [53].
These miRNAs have been associated with 1) apoptosis in ECs and cardiomyocytes (hasmiR-16-5p, has-miR-499a-5p, has-miR-21-5p, has-miR-22-3p, and has-miR-125b-5p) [5457]; 2) proliferation and differentiation in VSMCs and cardiomyocytes (has-miR-145-5p,
has-miR-143-3p, and has-miR-133a-3p) [49, 58, 59]; 3) angiogenesis (has-miR-222-3p,
and has-miR-22-3p) [58]; 4) secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (has-miR-186-5p,

has-miR-222-3p, and has-miR-22-3p) [58,59], 5) lipid accumulation (has-miR-186-5p) [59],
and 6) fibrosis (has-miR-22-3p) [52]. By regulating these processes, the differentially
expressed miRNAs are able to improve cardiac function (has-miR-22-3p), and to stimulate
cardiac regeneration (has-miR-146a-5p), cardiac tissue contractibility and calcium
handling (has-miR-21-5p) [54, 56].
To understand the processes regulated by the combination of the miRNAs upregulated in
the case-control study, we performed pathway analysis with the most conserved and
potentially effective targets. We found that the most associated pathways were related to
signaling by MAP and other kinases, toll like receptors, and inflammatory cytokines.
Kinase signaling pathways, including MAP and PI3K/Akt (both upregulated in our study),
are associated with oxidation, angiogenesis, cell cycle, and inflammatory cytokines [6163]. In addition, signaling trough toll like receptors triggers an inflammatory reaction [64].
The identified pathways suggest that the combined action of these 12 miRNAs regulates a
subset of the individual miRNA functions, particularly inflammation. Taking into account
that the most significant pathways identified in our study have already been associated
with AMI [64-67], this group of miRNAs can explain, at least in part, the molecular
response after AMI. And thus, these 12 miRNAs could be used to improve the diagnosis of
AMI, and the prognosis prediction in AMI patients. On the one hand, has-miR-499-5p and
has-miR-133a-3p showed high sensitivity and specificity values for the diagnosis of AMI in
meta-analyses [68, 69]. Regarding prognosis, has-miR-499-5p was associated with
reduced systolic function, and increased risk of death or heart failure after MI [70]. While
has-miR-21-5p, has-miR-143-3p, and has-miR-15a-5p (a member of the miR-15 family
that also includes miR-16), were upregulated in CAD patients with recurrent cardiovascular
events [58].

Our case-cohort study identified has-miR-143-3p as the only miRNA associated with timeto-coronary events independently of classical risk factors. Moreover, adding has-miR-1433p, alone or in combination with the 3 most differentially expressed miRNAs in the casecontrol study, to the commonly used risk factors improved reclassification measures. Only
the Hunt study has analyzed miRNA expression in healthy individuals to predict coronary
events [15]. The Hunt investigators identified 5 miRNAs that improved reclassification and
discrimination. However, these 5 miRNAs were different from the ones identified in the
present study, probably due to the different methodology applied. While the Hunt
investigators used a small panel of serum miRNAs (n=179), we focused on the miRNAs
associated with ox-LDL treatment from a larger miRNA panel (n=2,578), and on previously
reported miRNAs. Although the results differ, both studies suggest that new biomarkers
such as miRNAs could be useful to improve CAD risk prediction in general population.
While has-miR-143-3p was upregulated in AMI cases compared to controls, a higher
expression in healthy individuals was in contrast associated with a reduced risk of having
an incident CAD event. This result reflects the complex time- and cell type-specificity of
miRNA regulation. miR-143-3p is involved in the regulation of the phenotype and function
of EC and VSMCs [71, 72], an in the initiation of the inflammatory response in the
myocardium [73]. The increased expression of has-miR-143-3p in AMI patients is probably
a response to the acute event, as observed in ischemic stroke patients, in which its levels
decreased after the acute phase [74]. This acute upregulation of has-miR-143-3p could
mediate the initiation of the inflammatory response that is triggered after AMI [75]. In
addition, an increase in has-miR-143-3p expression could also stimulate vessel
stabilization through the transfer of this miRNA from VSMCs to ECs [76]. On the other
hand, miR-143 promotes differentiation and represses proliferation of VSMCs [71], and
was downregulated in animal models of atherosclerosis [71], and in CAD patients [77].

These results agree with our observation of a protective effect of has-miR-143-3p on the
CAD risk in healthy individuals. miR-143-3p, which is highly expressed in the normal
vascular wall, would maintain the differentiated state of VSMCs, while its downregulation
would be associated to a proliferating and less differentiated phenotype.
Our study is the first analyzing the contribution of miRNAs induced by ox-LDLs to the
identification of AMI cases and to CAD risk prediction in general population. We validated
miRNAs associated to ox-LDLs related processes, discovered new miRNAs expressed
after ox-LDLs treatment in EC and SMCs, validated miRNAs associated with AMI, and
identified miRNAs associated with CAD incidence in general population.
Our study has also some limitations that should be considered. In addition to validating
previously identified miRNAs in CAD, we wanted to analyze the contribution of ox-LDL
induced miRNAs, to the miRNA response in AMI, and to the miRNA expression in general
population to predict future CAD. However, among the miRNAs associated with ox-LDL
treatment, only 1 was dysregulated in AMI cases compared to controls, and none was
related to CAD incidence. This result is probably related to the different miRNA response
to ox-LDLs that occurs in vivo and in vitro. We palliated this limitation by including all
previously miRNAs known to be associated to CAD. Another limitation is that we could
only validate 5 out of 21 ox-LDL induced miRNAs in the study with EC and SMCs. The low
validation could be associated with a lower miRNA concentration in serum compared to
cell extracts.
In conclusion, we identified 2 novel miRNAs associated with ox-LDLs (has-miR-193b-5p
and has-miR-1229-5p). We also found 4 miRNAs that improve the reclassification capacity
of the REGICOR CAD risk function of general population based on their predicted CAD
risk (has-miR-143-3p, and its combination with has-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-133a-3p, and
hsa-miR-499-5p). Our findings provide more knowledge on the response to ox-LDLs at the
