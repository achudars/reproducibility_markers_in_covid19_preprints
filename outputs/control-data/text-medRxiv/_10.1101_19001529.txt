ABSTRACT

Background: Though there is thorough examination of psychosocial issues in SCT, there
are few longitudinal studies examining the meaning SCT patients attribute to their treatment.
Objective: The object of this study was to examine change in situational appraisal over time, and
to explore potential modifiers of that change. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study of 146
autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patients at Virginia Commonwealth
University (VCU) was conducted to measure situational appraisal over time as per the meaning
making model of Park and Folkman (1997) utilizing the Illness Perception QuestionnaireRevised (IPQ-R; Moss-Morris et al., 2002). Participants were administered the instrument prior
to transplant, at one, three and six months, and at one-year post-transplant. Results: Change over
time was seen in different diagnoses, donor types, reduced intensity and standard pre-transplant
preparative regimens, and between the two major ethnic groups (Caucasian and African
American) studied. Many of the patient subgroups had statistically significant findings in
measures of illness attribution. Conclusion: The appraisals SCT patients made of their situation
in treatment revealed a complex process of appraisal affected by illness, treatment and patient
characteristics including disease type, donor type, race, and pre-transplant regimen.

INTRODUCTION
Patients undergoing stem cell transplant (SCT) are surviving and living longer with
varying levels of transplant morbidity (Stronach, 2017; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, 2017;
American Cancer Society, 2017; Clauser, Gayer, Murphy, Majhaul & Baker, 2015; PatientCentered Outcomes Research Institute, 2017). The acute transplant process presents numerous
medical complications and significant toxicity. Increase in survivorship is a result of

improvements in medical science (Stronach, 2017; Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, 2017;
American Cancer Society, 2017). Patients experience a variety of adverse psychological
reactions during this treatment, and face existential crises, including fear of death, loss of control,
isolation, increases in dependency, and disabling physical symptoms. The transplant process is
rigorous and invasive, creating trauma that can disrupt a patient’s sense of meaning as defined by
the meaning making model of Park and Folkman (1997), who defined meaning making as an
intrinsic emotional/psychological processing or an extrinsic attempt to make sense of life events
(see the meaning making model chart in supplementary material).
Most of the literature on the emotional experience of SCT patients focuses on quality of
life after transplant, survival factors, social support, psychological reactions, candidacy
assessment, as these are primarily based in bio-psychosocial theory and explore various aspects
and combinations of these factors. The authors were able to find a few articles that closely
examined the existential crises associated with transplant (Beanlands, Lipton & McKay, 2003;
Cohen& Ley, 2000; Jones & Chapman, 2000; Morstyn, 2009; Quinn, 2003; Xuereb & Dunlop,
2003). Moore and Goldner-Vukov (2009) state that, "The bio-psychosocial model often fails to
sufficiently validate the existential suffering of patients." The experience of existential suffering
and the process of meaning making have been united in concept and process in the experience of
cancer patients (Breitbart, 2017). However, there are few examples of longitudinal studies
examining situational illness appraisals over time. Situational appraisal is defined as an internal
cognitive assessment process of a personal - environmental transaction in which one’s sense of
concordance or discordance with beliefs and abilities can generate emotion and affect coping.
(Park & Folkman, 1997). The appraisal made of a situation as discrepant with global meaning
can cause distress and leads to higher risks of negative emotional outcomes (Park & Folkman,

1997). The unresolved distress can lead to altered coping and adjustment; conversely, successful
resolution of distress facilitates post traumatic growth and the resultant successful adjustment
(Park, Chmielewski & Blank, 2010). The rigor of stem cell transplantation causes patients to
initiate meaning making attempts due to the disruption and distress it creates.
This study attempted to increase understanding of a theoretically complex process of
appraisal and adjustment by focusing on the patient experience. The meaning making model
posits that individuals have a sense of global meaning, defined as beliefs/goals about a just
world; this meaning is shattered by traumatic situations, leading to distress. Individuals engage
in a process to rectify this and reduce distress, making intrinsic and extrinsic attempts to make
sense of the disparity resulting either in continued distress or resolution. Successful resolution is
seen in assimilating the new information into pre-existing schemata or accommodating –
essentially revising one’s global meaning. Distress has been studied from the perspective of
meaning making as an attempt to understand significant life stressors (Park, 2010). The meaning
making model was the theoretical basis for examining a sample of SCT patients at VCU in a
prospective, longitudinal behavioral health study examining changes in situational appraisal over
time, and also to explore potential modifiers of that change.
TRANSPLANT AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING
Stem cell transplant is the process by which a person's bone marrow is either partially or
totally ablated by combinations of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immune suppressive
medicine and the resulting aplasia managed by an infusion of their own previously harvested
marrow/ stem cells (autologous transplant) or a donor's marrow / stem cells (allogeneic
transplant). Hematological cancers are the primary illnesses treated in this fashion. Following
transplantation, patients make frequent visits to the transplant center for close medical
management. The treatment center becomes a temporary society and identity; substitution of a

network can occur in an attempt to resolve the dilemma of loss in this area (Heine, Proulx &
Vohs, 2006). The experience when a fellow patient dies promotes survivors’ guilt and renews
fear of one’s mortality. Isolation increases when visits to the center are reduced, but the patient
is still restricted from activities. Endurance and easy fatigability limits activity. Patients
experience changes in endocrine function that affect perceived wellness. Cognitive effects
caused by treatment (colloquially known as “chemo brain”) causes difficulties in function and
return to work. Patients often express a fear of death; assessment of clinical depression is
confounded by chronic illness, medicinal effects and existential/spiritual distress (WilliamsLloyd, Reeve, Kissane, 2008; Kissane et al., 2004). Existential distress is defined as difficulty
coping accompanied by feelings of helplessness, lack of meaning, isolation, fear of mortality,
reduced self-efficacy and self-esteem, and diminished hopefulness. This existential crisis can be
induced by the SCT process and its resultant functional restrictions and outcomes (Morstyn,
2009; Xuereb & Dunlop, 2003).
Allogeneic transplant has the added difficulty of integrating the donor's immune system
with the host, in the hope that a graft (the donor cells) versus disease effect will occur.
Transplant may be unsuccessful and fail to achieve a cure or extended disease-free survival due
to relapse of underlying disease. These risks are unpredictable so maintaining a steady state
which is essential for reduction in threat to meaning is not possible. This instability, combined
with effects on a patient’s physical and cognitive abilities, creates challenges in engaging and
sustaining meaning making attempts. Victor Frankl (1959) put forth the idea that meaning in life
was central to healthy functioning and adaptation.
Patients who are transplant candidates have high risk diseases that are unlikely to remain
in remission with standard therapy. Transplant with its risks is a choice made by patients hoping

for cure or extended life. Clinical observation of the authors suggests that stem cell transplant
threatens individual meaning (self-esteem, goals, mortality), disrupt relational networks (friends,
work, community activities), and cause role loss because of treatment. The individual’s
interpretation of suffering varies by culture; cultural archetypes, such as “rugged individualism,”
are common in the United States, which may worsen the impact of these disruptions on a
personal level (May 1991).

METHODS
PATIENTS
Inclusion criteria included SCT patients’ ≥ 18 years of age. Potential subjects who were
developmentally or cognitively impaired were excluded. Potential subjects unable to complete
the assessment instruments in English were excluded, as all instruments were written in English.
Participants were offered enrolment during their pre-transplant psychosocial evaluation and were
given their first set of instruments. The number of patients that met study criteria and were
transplanted from March 8, 2013- March 8, 2015 totaled approximately 254; all eligible patients
were approached by social workers and 146 were enrolled. The reason for non-enrolment was
patients declining to participate in the study. Nine patients who were enrolled did not medically
advance to the transplant process. The primary cause of patient’s dropping out of the study was
death or severe morbidity preventing further completion of the survey. 32 patients died within a
year or less of their transplant. Seven patients withdrew due to changing their minds about
participating (they felt overwhelmed by their treatment or did not want to bother with the
questionnaires). One patient was withdrawn due to not completing the first measure prior to
transplant. The principal investigator was responsible for follow up to provide subsequent survey
packets and reminder letters if instruments were not returned. The patients were given packets in

person or through the mail based on their schedule of visits to the center. The instruments
following the pre-transplant time period were provided based on their date of transplant (that
determined the one, three, six month and one-year time frames) with a window of +-15 days.
Questionnaires returned were entered into the data base built in REDCap (Research Electronic
Data Capture Consortium) primarily by the principal investigator with assistance from a MSW
graduate student (the data was de-identified at that time).
STUDY MEASURES
Demographic data was collected by the principal investigator from the electronic medical
record (Cerner) and from CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant
Research) records kept by the program. The time periods selected for examination (baseline, one
month, three months, six months, and one year) were selected in consultation with the physician
advisor as clinically significant in the recovery trajectory from transplant. Response rates were
calculated for each time period. This study was approved by the institution’s IRB (study number
HM14968) and the Massey Cancer Center’s Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee. The
patients provided written informed consent and signed HIPPA statements as required by the IRB.
The following questionnaire was used at all time points.

The instrument is available as

supplementary material.
The Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R; Moss-Morris et al., 2002) is a 7
domain Likert-type item questionnaire that measures various aspects of understanding of one’s
illness and served as the primary measure of situational appraisal. In addition to the domains of
Identity, Timeline (Timeline-acute/chronic and Timeline cyclical), Consequences,
Cure/Controllability, and the Causes subscales found in the original version, the revised version
includes Emotional Representation and Illness Coherence subscales which consider the cognitive
and emotional aspects of illness perception (Abubakari et al., 2012). This instrument is based on

Leventhal’s Self-Regulatory Model and was chosen due to its use of health-related constructs as
a measure of situational appraisal (Moss-Morris et al., 2002). This is related to the meaning
making model as it was used in this study to assess situational appraisal of SCT patients as this
appraisal drives the experience of distress that theoretically leads to meaning making attempts
(see Figure 1 for model diagram). The sub-scales are used exclusively in scoring and there is no
total score for the instrument as a whole.
Subscales of the IPQ-R
The IPQ-R subscales can be sub-divided into two broad categories: those representing positive
situational attribution, and those representing negative situational attribution. There are three
subscales representing positive situational attribution: Treatment Control, Personal Control, and
Illness Coherence. Treatment and personal control reflect the positive illness belief that one has
control over treatment and one’s personal life; i.e., Examples are “Treatment can control my
illness;” and “What I do can determine whether my illness gets better or worse.” Illness
coherence reflects the positive illness belief that the condition makes sense; i.e., “I don’t
understand my illness,” which is a personal understanding of the illness or a meta-cognition
(Moss-Morris et al., 2002). Higher values for each of these three subscales indicate more positive
situational attribution.
There are five subscales representing negative situational attribution: Identity, Timeline
(Acute or Chronic), Timeline Cyclical, Emotional Representation, and Consequences. The
Identity subscale reflects the presence of physical symptoms and whether the patient attributes
them to the illness or having been present prior to their illness, including nausea, fatigue,
weakness and other symptoms that are related to cancer treatment. This sub-scale separates
somatization from illness identity (Moss-Morris et al., 2002). Greater illness related symptom

burden relates to patients’ reporting reduced control and greater negative illness attributions.
Timeline reflects the chronic nature of the illness (i.e., “my illness will last a long time”) while
timeline cyclical reflects a person’s sense that their symptoms come and go and are unpredictable
(i.e., “The symptoms of my illness change from day to day”). Emotional representation is the
assessment of negative emotions related to the illness; i.e., “Having this illness makes me
anxious.” This subscale was added to the revised version of the instrument to capture the
emotional aspects of illness in addition to the cognitive aspects that are a part of the other subscales. Consequences reflects the assessment of negative results of an illness on one’s life; i.e.,
“My illness does not have much effect on my life.” Higher scores on these sub-scales reflect
greater negative view of the illness.
STATISTICAL METHODS
IPQ-R subscales for positive situational attributions (treatment and personal control,
illness coherence) and negative situational attributions (timeline acute or chronic, timeline
cyclical, emotional representations, and consequences) are summarized at each time point with
sample sizes, means, and standard deviations. Trends in these means over time are tested using a
linear mixed effect model with the IPQ-R subscale as a continuous, normally distributed
outcome and a five-level fixed effect for time. Dependence within subjects are fit with a firstorder auto regressive correlation structure (heterogeneous variance was examined but based on
small-sample adjusted AICs did not fit as well as assuming homogeneous variance). The
MEANS and GLIMMIX procedures in the SAS statistical software (version 9.4, Cary, NC,
USA) were used for analysis.
Sample Size Determination
Assuming ten total comparisons for each IPQ-R subscale (baseline to 1 month, baseline
to 3 months, baseline to 6 months, baseline to one year, 1 to 3 months, 1 to 6 months, 1 month to

1 year, 3 to 6 months, 3 months to one year, 6 months to one year), a step-down-adjusted
significance level of α/k = 0.05/10 = 0.005, and a subscale standard deviation of 5.0, we planned
for 136 respondents, which would provide at least 80% power for finding at least one difference
of magnitude 1.6 in IPQ-R subscale means over time.
RESULTS
Demographics (Table 1 here)
Out of 148 participants (out of approximately 210 eligible patients), more patients received
autologous transplants (60%) than received allogeneic transplants (40%). Most of the patients
(73%) were Caucasian, while 22% were African American, which reflects the racial distribution
in Virginia as a whole (Pew Research Center, 2014). There were more male participants (61%)
than female (39%). In the area of educational level, 41.9% of participants had a high school
education or less; 43.9% had some college. Most patients had myeloma (40%), acute leukemia
(26%) or lymphoma (21%), and the others made up other blood cancer or
myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic and bone marrow failure conditions. The religious
background included mostly participants Protestant faiths (73%), with smaller numbers of
Catholics (17%) and those with no religious tradition (8.3%). Sample sizes in Table 1 tables are
at times less than 148 due to subjects missing values for particular characteristics.
Overall Trends in Situational Attribution
Response rates for the IPQ-R subscales ranges between 43%-93% at baseline, 26%-72% at time
2, 30%-62% at time 3, 29%-56% at time 4, 16%-45% at time 5, and 3%-5% at time 6.
Longitudinal trends in IPQ-R subscales are found in Table 2. For the Positive Situational
Attribution subscales, there was significant evidence of change over time in the Treatment
Control and Personal Control scales. Participants’ scores trended downwards for treatment

control over time (F (4,347.7) = 9.1; p=<0.0001). Personal Control also trended downwards less
so than Treatment Control (F (4,336.1) =3.0; p=0.0203).The patients reported that their
perception of control over their treatment decreased throughout the study year. For the Negative
Situational Attribution subscales, only Consequences showed a slow but significant decrease
over time (F (4,346.7) = 3.1; p=0.0166). Participants views of how much the illness had
negative consequences in their lives decreased over the study year. There was non-significant
evidence for changes in Timeline Acute/Chronic and for Emotional Representations. The
patients viewed their illness as more chronic as time went on – scores increased over the study
year (F (4,329.6) = 2.1; p=0.0835). Emotional Representations scores started high and then were
lowest by 90 days, followed by an increase that ended at a year out higher than but not as high as
pre-transplant measures (F (4,346.8) = 2.3; p=0.0567). The patients’ negative feelings about their
illness were lowest at 90 days.

Trends by Participant Characteristics
Trends in IPQ-R subscales over time are presented for different levels of patient characteristics
(when significant) in Table 3. (Donor Type) The Treatment Control subscale did not change over
time based on donor type, through there was a significant difference between groups (F (1,149.0)
= 8.8; p=0.0035). Allogeneic patients reported feeling more control over their treatment than
autologous patients. There were significant Timeline Cyclical trends over time for donor types (F
(4,305.0) = 2.5; p=0.0411), with subscale scores occasionally increasing in allogeneic patients
and remaining relatively constant in autologous patients. There was no significance in trends in
the Consequences subscale over time, but there were significant differences between donor types

(F (1,151.9) = 6.1; p=0.0148), where allogeneic patients had higher scores and so viewed their
illness as having more consequences on their lives, then autologous patients.
(Diagnosis) There were significant differences in the Illness Coherence subscale over
time for diagnostic groups (F (8,281.6) = 2.3; p=0.0203). The lymphoma patients’ scores stayed
within the same range while leukemia patients’ scores decreased, and myeloma patients showed
a one-time increase at 180 days. Leukemia patients felt that their illness made less sense then
lymphoma and myeloma patients. There were no significant trends in the Timeline subscale
over time for diagnostic groups, though there was a significant difference between groups on this
measure (F (2,136.7) = 6.7; p=0.0016). Myeloma patients viewed their illness as more chronic
than the other groups. Leukemia patients were the next highest group, with lymphoma patients
viewing their illness as less chronic and more acute. Likewise, there was no significant trends in
the Consequences subscale over time for diagnostic groups and attribution of consequences,
though there were differences between the groups (F (2,134.0) = 5.7; p=0.0041). Leukemia
patients viewed the illness as having the most consequences on their lives, myeloma patients
were next highest, followed by lymphoma patients.
(Ethnicity) There were significant differences in the Timeline subscale over time between
Caucasian and African American patients in how they viewed the illness chronicity (F (4,285.4)
= 3.9; p=0.0041). African Americans began with a lower score which increases over time – they
saw their illness as more acute in the beginning and more chronic later. Caucasians viewed their
illness as a more chronic phenomenon early on and this increased at a slower pace than their
African American counterparts. All scores trended to indicate they viewed their illness as more
chronic as the study year progressed. There was no difference in temporal trend in the
Consequences subscale between ethnic groups, but there were absolute differences in the scores

between groups (F (1,136.4) = 5.5; p=0.0211). Caucasian patients viewed their illness as having
greater consequences for their lives while African Americans viewed the illness has having less
of an impact.
(Gender) There were significant differences in the Timeline Cyclical subscale between
men and women’s views of the illness as coming and going and being unpredictable (F (1,143.9)
= 6.7; p=0.0106). Women viewed the cyclical and unpredictable nature of the illness as greater
than men.
(Type of Preparation (treatment prior to cell infusion)) There were significant differences
in the Timeline Cyclical subscale over time for patients who had the two types of pre-transplant
preparation regimens (full intensity vs. reduced intensity) (F (4,323.0) = 2.7; p=0.0332). The
reduced intensity group included those who did not have fully myeloablative transplants. The
patients with reduced intensity transplants had higher scores on this measure at day 30 – they
viewed their illness as unpredictable and changeable – then those with full intensity treatment.
DISCUSSION
This study showed change over time in measures that illustrated the SCT experience.
The focus was on situational attribution. Park and George (2013) speak to the challenges of
examining the complex and theoretically rich concepts inferred in the meaning making model.
Change over time was found within the group as a whole, donor types, different diagnoses,
within the two major ethnic groups, between genders, and those patients with different pretransplant prep regimens.
The meaning making model posits that if meaning is made, then distress is relieved and
the cycle of meaning making attempts can be resolved. The nature of stem cell transplant –
especially for those that receive donor cells – lends itself to a long process and unexpected
complications. Patients and their families often remark that it is difficult to make short or long-

term plans. Park and Gutierrez (2013) discussed that well-being was strongly associated with
one’s perception of controllability of circumstances. In our study, participants’ felt that
treatment control decreased over time. Appraisal violations of global meaning by attribution of a
situation as traumatic lead to stress; emotional well-being was worse pre-transplant as patients
cope with shock, the unknown, and feel anxiety about the upcoming transplant (Park, Mills &
Edmondson, 2012). Cure of disease does not mean life lacking disability or residual effect patients viewed their illness as more chronic as time passed. This indicates the varied wellness
and experience of the patients as frequent meaning violations create greater physiologic and
psychological stress (Park, Mills & Edmondson, 2012; Steger, 2012).
The effects of treatment protocol explain the variance seen between diagnostic groups.
African American patients attributed less effect of the illness on their lives than Caucasian
patients (consequences) but attributed more of the symptoms to their illness (higher Identity
scores). The numbers of African Americans in the study who completed the Identity scores was
low, limiting the conclusions drawn. They also started out seeing their illness as less chronic.
Women saw their illness as unpredictable compared to men. The reason for this is
unclear and the study itself did not answer this question. Socialized gender differences and
physiology could be explanations.
Patients who received a less intense preparative regimen perceived their illness to be
unpredictable and changing. This appears counterintuitive as one would assume a less medically
toxic protocol would infer fewer side effects from toxicity, hence more predictable and less
changeable symptoms.
Other Results - Discussion
There were patient characteristics that lacked change over time and did not have absolute
differences in IPQ-R sub-scales. If differences based on a characteristic were stable over time,

this may be indicative of resiliency factors. Hayes (Hayes, Laurenceau, Feldman, Strauss &
Cardaciott, 2007) and Bonanno (2004) suggest, there are non-linear processes at work and
intermittent distress can occur, but psychologically healthy individuals remain stable over time.
SCT pre-transplant evaluation screens out patients psychosocially and medically not equipped to
manage the process as ethics dictates one not cause harm. Hayes argues for single subject design
as a population contains individuals with differing recovery trajectories (Hayes, Laurenceau,
Feldman, Strauss & Cardaciott, 2007). The results above argue for study of discrete populations,
determining which patients have strong resilience characteristics, and how this affects their
process. Meaning making may not always occur. The authors’ experience clinically gives
witness to individuals’ non-linear experience and sudden change in coping (both in onset of
distress and in post-traumatic growth). The group analysis masked the individualized
experience.
Study Limitations
The study of meaning making is theoretically rich and methodologically challenging;
some of the challenges could not be controlled adequately in this study (Park, 2010).
Participants’ responses are related to a variety of factors – whether they were responding to their
cancer not the transplant, possibility of cure, and specific complications vs. the transplant
experience. These are confounding factors. Not all patients completed the entire set of
questionnaire packets. Patient mortality affected this result - occasionally patients were too sick
at intervals to complete instruments. There are differences between autologous and allogeneic
patients or those with malignancies, and those who had bone marrow failure/other non-malignant
conditions (Braamse, Gerrits, Meijl, 2012). The pre-transplant course of treatment and disease
characteristics are different in some cases. Study of discrete groups within the transplant

population reduces sample size thus reducing statistical significance. Multi-center studies are
indicated here.
The questionnaire packets were self-administered and not done in the presence of the
investigators. Enrollment was conducted by the social workers on the study who handled the
distribution of study instruments in person or through the mail. The combination of serving as
clinical treatment staff and investigating staff could have introduced response bias; there is no
indication that this occurred. The conditions under which participants completed questionnaires
varied over their study year (in hospital, clinic, or home). Some patient groups had small
numbers - the tandem transplant patients and those receiving reduced intensity conditioning.
Analyses of the smaller numbered subsets limit data generalizations. Occasionally participants
complained about the repetition of measures over time.
This study involved combining behavioral health measures with medical data. The
realities and structure of data management at the Health System prevented the researchers from
gathering specific medical data that might have better clarified results. Data for SCT patients
was maintained in more than one system. These systems were not connected; the type and
quality of data available varied. The data was recorded by more than one provider and was
sometimes incomplete.
Clinical Implications
Clinical observation indicates the recovery from transplant does not occur in a linear
fashion and is marked by complications that arise unexpectedly. This suggests that the
participants may re-experience distress due to the repeated crises affecting the ability to maintain
a steady state needed to accommodate or assimilate meaning (Davis, Wortman, Lehman &
Cohen-Silver, 2000; Park, 2010). This is due to perception of threat vs. controllability in coping
to manage the challenge (Bonanno, 2013). There is evidence that patient’s recovery is affected

by ability to participate in tasks, like exercise (Fiuza-Luces, Simpson, Ramirez, Lucia & Berger,
2016) and this can be driven by expectation set and coping. Continued threat leads to continued
distress (Park & Al, 2006). Significant demographic differences lacking change over time infer
stable characteristics that argue for study of resilience factors. This study indicated ethnic
differences in illness attribution which are under examined in the literature. What are affects that
exist in social oppression and inequity? How do social determinants of health and resilience
factors affect the patients? Variability occurs as a result of culture, age, gender and spirituality
(Alea & Bluck, 2013; Park, 2005; Hart & Singh, 2009). There is evidence that there are differing
predictors and correlates these include, but are not limited to: meaning, purpose, well-being,
accommodation, assimilation, post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic depreciation (Kissane, et
al., 2004). Future studies of situational attribution, resilience, and regulatory flexibility might be
indicated.
Goals and beliefs are postulated to make up one’s global meaning. Violations of global
meaning by situational appraisal involve conscious and automatic meaning making attempts
(Xuereb & Dunlop, 2003). Researchers can examine meanings made and mechanisms that
facilitate this end (accommodation vs. assimilation). Global meaning and post-traumatic growth
were not directly studied by these authors. It would be helpful to assess the type of meanings
made by SCT patients and how this effects adjustment. Inclusion of measures that determine
incidents of repeated crises in the patients’ medical trajectory is recommended. Patients that
derive a sense of purpose, reason and meaning to the suffering they experience and that have
renewed relationships and post-traumatic growth that incorporate the challenges of cancer are
important for successful adjustment (Park, 2010; Davis, Wortman, Lehman & Cohen-Silver,

2000). Combining resilience work and meaning making has application here. These are areas
worth future research, and SCT patients enable the option of prospective and longitudinal study.
