ABSTRACT
Background Uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for
people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been limited by an absence
of rigorous evidence-based studies supporting use. Our objective were to report and
summarise the current evidence supporting use of nutritional supplementation to improve
outcomes during pulmonary rehabilitation in stable COPD patients.
Methods A systematic search was conducted up to May 7th, 2019 (registration number
CRD42018089142). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Six databases were included: Medical Literature
Analysis and Retrieval System Online or MEDLARS Online (Medline), Allied and
Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science.
Results This systematic search generated 580 initial matches, of which 24 studies (1035
COPD participants) met the pre-specified criteria and were included. Our analysis does not
confirm an impact of nutritional supplementation during PR, but studies, supplements and PR
programmes were heterogeneous in nature.
Conclusion There is currently insufficient evidence on the effect of nutritional
supplementation on improving outcomes during PR in patients with COPD. Therefore,
controversy

remains

and

further

research

is

needed.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with COPD tend to have daily symptoms, reduced exercise capacity, and
susceptibility to exacerbations, resulting in reduced health-related quality of life.(1-3) The
international GOLD strategy document summarises current approaches to COPD
management.(1) Cost-effective treatment approaches for COPD, described in the ‘Value
Pyramid’ (4) include: smoking cessation, influenza vaccination, and pulmonary
rehabilitation. Multiple high-quality randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses have
demonstrated that pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective management strategy in COPD
patients, since it improves exercise performance, reduces dyspnoea, reduces the risk of
exacerbation, and improves health-related quality of life.(5-10)
Exercise intolerance/limitation is one of the most common problems for COPD
patients and this may be compounded by reduced muscle mass and malnutrition. It has been
reported that COPD patients may lose body weight and skeletal muscle mass, which leads to
muscle weakness and dysfunction impacting functional ability and quality of life.(11) Muscle
disuse, caused by a prolonged sedentary lifestyle and voluntary immobilisation, leads to
muscle deconditioning and thus, reduced muscle strength and endurance.(12) It has also been
postulated that COPD is associated with a myopathy, which may be driven by systemic
inflammation.(12) Additionally, being underweight is associated with an increased risk of
mortality in COPD.(13) Weight loss predicts mortality and morbidity in chronic lung disease
patients.(8) Therefore patients with COPD are at risk of significant morbidity and mortality
as a result of changes in body composition and nutritional and metabolic status.
It is been suggested that healthy older adults require additional nutrients compared
with young adults to preserve bone and lean mass. For instance, it is recommended that
young adult require 0.7 g of protein/ kg body weight per day while the recommendation for
older adults is 1.2 to 1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day, especially for people with conditions

that require higher levels of protein, such as COPD.(14) Nutritional supplements have been
used to overcome malnutrition in patients with COPD. It has been suggested that nutritional
support integrated with exercise training may improve exercise activity, decrease the risk of
mortality, and improved muscle strength in undernourished COPD patients.(15, 16) A metaanalysis of nutritional supplementation for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by
Ferreira et al. in 2012 included 17 randomised clinical trials and concluded that nutritional
supplements increased muscle mass and body weight, and improved respiratory function and
exercise tolerance in COPD patients who were poorly nourished.(17) Additionally, Collins et
al. demonstrated in their meta-analysis of nutritional support and functional capacity in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that nutritional supplements improved weight and
handgrip strength in COPD patients.(18) Both reviews only included randomised clinical
trials and it was not necessary for participants to be engaged in PR. We hypothesised that an
integrated approach of exercise training and nutritional support might be the best way to seek
functional improvements. However, uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary
rehabilitation, where the potential benefit may be greatest, has been limited by the absence of
rigorous evidence-based studies supporting use. The objective of this systematic review was
to report and summarise the current evidence for using nutritional supplementation during
pulmonary rehabilitation in stable COPD patients to enhance PR outcomes.

METHODS
Search strategy
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines were used for this systematic review, with Prospero registration
number CRD42018089142.(19) The search was conducted up to May 7th, 2019 using

(AMED), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cumulative Index of Nursing and
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science database (table A1, table A2, table
A3, table A4, table A5). The search strategy and terms used in this systematic review are
described in the Appendix. The bibliography of eligible articles as well as existing systematic
reviews in the field were also screened.

Inclusion criteria
The PICOS (P –population, patient, problem; I –intervention; C –control, comparison or
comparator; O –outcome) criteria for included studies appear in Table1. Studies were
included in the systematic review if they met all of the following criteria
1) Studies of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD.
2) No evidence of recent exacerbation as described in the individual studies.
3) Patients enrolled on a Pulmonary Rehabilitation or other exercise training programme.
4) Patients receiving nutritional supplementation (caloric, non-caloric, powder, liquid,
capsule, or tablets) during Pulmonary Rehabilitation or an exercise training program.

Exclusion criteria
We excluded:
1) Book chapters.
2) Systematic reviews (but screened the reference lists)
3) Non-English manuscripts.
4) Conference abstracts with no full-text.
5) Non-full text articles.
The main outcomes of interest were to investigate the impact of nutritional
supplementation during PR programmes on exercise function, body composition, peripheral
muscles strength, respiratory muscle function, and quality of life.

Data collection
Three authors (AA, JH, & SM) screened the titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant
studies. Full texts of the relevant studies were read by the first author (AA) to evaluate if they
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The reference lists of included studies and excluded systematic
reviews were also screened; two additional studies were found, and the senior authors (JH &
SM) discussed eligibility. Disagreements between authors were resolved by discussion.

Quality assessment
The first and seventh authors (AA & JH) performed risk of bias assessment using the
Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool to assess randomised studies, which comprises seven questions,
and the Modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess cohort studies, which is also made up of
seven questions.(20, 21) For the randomised trials, we scored each of the seven domains as 0
(low risk of bias) or 1 (high risk of bias, or bias unclear). There was therefore a total score

between 0 and 7 in which a higher score equates to a higher risk of bias. For cohort studies,
each of the 7 domains was scored from 0 (high risk of bias) to 3 (low risk of bias) and we
took a mean of the domains to result in a score between 0 and 3 where a higher score
represents a lower risk of bias.

Synthesis of results
The main purpose of this systematic review was to report and summarise the current
evidence of using nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation in stable
COPD. A meta-analysis was not attempted due to methodological heterogeneity between
studies. Our discussion focuses on the studies at lower risk of bias.

RESULTS
Initially, 580 studies were considered potentially eligible. However, after removing
duplicates, 449 titles and abstracts were included. Screening the titles and abstracts resulted
in 32 from 449 studies being considered for full-text reading. After reading the full-text of 32
studies, eight further studies were excluded (table A6). Screening the reference list of eligible
studies revealed two further relevant studies. Thus 24 studies in total met the inclusion
criteria for the systematic review (see Figure 1).
The 24 studies comprised five cohort studies and 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The
sample size and study duration varied between 8 and 80 participants and six weeks to four
months, respectively. A full description of the included RCTs and cohort studies appear in
Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Also, risk of bias assessment for RCT and cohort studies

Exercise capacity
Data on exercise function, performance, capacity, or endurance were reported in 20
studies using the Endurance Shuttle Walking Test, Incremental Shuttle Walking Test, Six
Minute Walk test, Twelve Minute Walk test, treadmill, and incremental or constant workload cycle ergometry. Seventeen studies found that using nutritional supplements such as
high carbohydrates, vitamin D, creatine, or L-carnitine in addition to pulmonary rehabilitation
programs had no statistical benefit compared to PR alone.(22, 24-28, 31, 33-35, 37-42, 44)
Three studies found that using nutritional supplements (Polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA
and Respifor which is high carbohydrates) had a statistically significant benefit on top of
pulmonary rehabilitation.(29, 32, 36)
There was only one study with positive findings at the lowest risk of bias (1/7), in
which Sugawara et al. reported increases in Six-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) by 19.7 ±
24.7 m (less than the minimum clinically important difference). In this RCT the intervention
group received a complex supplement twice a day composed of 200 kilocalories, 60%
carbohydrates, 15% protein, 25% fat, and 248 μg of omega-3 PUFAs 0.6 with vitamins A, C,
and E and a 12 week exercise programme while the control group underwent a 12 week
exercise programme only.(29) There were four RCTs with a similarly low risk of bias which
demonstrated no benefit of supplementation. Bool et al.(24) reported that using a high
carbohydrate supplementation once a day (125 mL of 9.4 g protein, 28.1 g carbohydrate and
4.1 g fat, leucine, n-3 PUFA and vitamin D) over a period of four months within an outpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation did not show any significant improvement in exercise performance
measured by cycle endurance time (CET) or 6MWT compared to the control PR group who
received flavoured non-caloric aqueous solution as a placebo. Similarly, the study by Paulin
et al. found that using vitamin B12 for eight weeks during outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation
did not show any significant improvement in exercise performance and duration compared to

PR alone.(25) Borghi-Silva et al. reported that using L-carnitine twice a day for six weeks did
not show significant improvement in exercise performance measured by treadmill and
6MWT when compared to the placebo group, who received saline solution for the same
duration.(34) Finally, Faager et al. concluded that using creatine for eight weeks during PR
did not improve exercise performance when measured by ESWT compared to the placebo
(glucose) group who underwent the same PR.(35)

Body composition
Seventeen trials measured body composition including body weight, fat-free mass,
fat-free mass index, and body mass index.
Body weight was one of the most frequent outcomes measured before and after giving
nutritional supplementation; 13 studies measured body weight in COPD patients with normal
BMI. Eight studies reported that body weight increased significantly following nutritional
supplementation compared to the placebo groups (22, 27, 29, 30, 38, 40, 43, 45), and the
study by Broekhuizen et al.(42) compared two nutritional supplements regimes which found
that both interventions significantly increased body weight. Four studies reported that body
weight did not significantly improve in the intervention groups when compared to the
placebo groups.(31, 33, 35, 36) Of the RCTs in which body weight significantly increased,
there was only one study, that by Sugawara, that had a low risk of bias.(29) This study
reported a significant increase in body weight after 12 weeks of 2.6 ± 3 kg in those receiving
the complex supplementation (described above) with mean baseline body weight of 50.8 kg,
compared to those in the placebo group with mean baseline body weight of 54.8 kg.(29) In
the study by Gurgun et al. there were significant improvements in body weight of 1.1 ± 0.9
kg, BMI 0.2 ± 1.4 kg/m2, and in Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI) (0.6 ±0.5 kg/m2) in those who
received 250 ml of 83.3% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 16.7% protein three times a day as an

intervention.(27) Of the four studies with negative findings, one study was at low risk of
bias.(35) This study found no significant difference in body weight between the creatine
intervention group and the placebo group after eight weeks.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was assessed before and after using supplementation in six out of 24
studies.(23, 27, 32, 34, 36, 38) BMI significantly increased in the supplementation group
when compared to the placebo group in three studies.(27, 32, 38) Three studies reported no
significant difference in BMI between participants who received nutritional supplementation
with PR compared to PR only.(23, 34, 36) One RCT at the lowest risk of bias showed no
improvement in BMI with carnitine.(34) In contrast, Gurgun et al. reported that BMI
significantly increased after receiving nutritional supplement.(27)
Fat-free mass (FFM) was evaluated in nine trials.(29, 30, 33, 36, 37, 40, 42, 43, 45)
Three studies demonstrated that FFM increased significantly in comparison with the placebo
group but these studies all had some risk of bias.(37, 40, 43) Two (27, 32) out of four studies
(27, 32, 36, 42) with some risk of bias reported that FFMI significantly increased in the
supplemental group when compared to the placebo group. In contrast, the study by
Broekhuizen et al. reported no significant difference in FFMI between the group who
received PUFA as an intervention and the placebo group who received palm and sunflower
oil with vitamin E capsule as a placebo.(36)

Peripheral muscle strength
Of the 24 studies included in the systematic review, 12 studies measured quadriceps
muscles strength, handgrip strength, or both.(22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31-33, 35-38)
Three studies reported that handgrip strength did not significantly improve in the
intervention groups when compared to the placebo groups.(35, 36, 38) Faager et al. being at
lowest risk of bias, reported that using carnitine for eight weeks during PR did not

significantly improve handgrip strength when compared to the placebo group who received
glucose.(35) In contrast, the study by Fuld et al. which had a higher risk of bias, showed
significant improvement in the handgrip after using creatine three times a day for two weeks
followed by once a day for 10 weeks.(37)
Quadriceps muscle strength was assessed in 12 studies.(22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31-33, 3538) Of the 12 RCTs only three studies with 86 participants in total demonstrated positive
findings.(29, 32, 37) Sugawara et al. which had a low risk of bias, concluded that quadriceps
muscle strength increased significantly after receiving a complex nutritional supplement
when compared to the placebo group.(29, 32, 37) However, nine studies reported that using
nutritional supplementation during a pulmonary rehabilitation program had no additional
effect on quadriceps muscles strength.(22, 24, 26, 28, 31, 33, 35, 36, 38) Bool et al. with a
low risk of bias, reported that using a high carbohydrate supplement showed no significant
improvement in quadriceps strength when compared to the placebo group.(24) Similarly, the
study by Faager et al. showed that using creatine for eight weeks in COPD patients who were
enrolled in an eight week PR programme did not reveal significant differences when
measuring quadriceps muscles strength compared with those who used placebo.(35)

Respiratory muscle function
Respiratory muscle function was assessed in nine of the 24 included studies (24, 28,
29, 32, 34, 36, 37, 40, 43), of which three were at lowest risk of bias.(24, 29, 34) Sugawara et
al. reported that maximum inspiratory pressure significantly improved in the interventional
group (39.2 ± 38.9 cmH2O) after receiving the nutritional supplement embedded in 12 weeks
of pulmonary rehabilitation compared with the placebo group (0.1 ± 24.1 cmH2O).(29) A
small study by Borghi-Silva et al. showed a significant improvement in MIP (40 ± 14
cmH2O) with carnitine compared to placebo (MIP; 14 ± 5 cmH2O).(34) In contrast, in a

larger study by Bool et al. did not show a significant improvement in MIP when compared
with the placebo group, who received glucose.(24) None of the studies that measured
maximal expiratory pressure showed a significant difference between interventional and
placebo groups.(32, 36, 40)

Quality of life
Quality of life was assessed in 16 out of 24 studies.(22-24, 26-29, 31-33, 35, 37, 38,
41-43) Eight studies used the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (22, 26, 27, 32,
35, 37, 42, 43), six used the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) (28, 29, 31, 33, 38,
41), three used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (22, 24, 27), and only one
study used the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Overall, only two studies demonstrated a
significant improvement in quality of life with supplementation in addition to PR.(29, 37)
Sugawara et al. which was at lowest risk of bias, quality of life measured by the Chronic
Respiratory Disease Questionnaire significantly improved after receiving a nutritional
supplement when compared with placebo group.(29) Fourteen studies showed negative
findings including two RCTs, at lowest risk of bias, including the study by Faager et al. using
creatine supplementation and the study by Bool et al. using the high carbohydrate
supplement, which has been describe above. Faager et al. using creatine for eight weeks
during PR did not improve quality of life measured by SGRQ.(35) Similarly, Bool et al.
reported that four months of using oral nutritional intervention did not improve quality of life
measured by HADS.(24)

DISCUSSION
This review is the first to summarise the potential effects of using nutritional
supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD. The studies varied

in design, and used differing supplements (protein based, vitamin based, amino acid based,
carbohydrate based, or fat based), measured various outcomes, and featured different types of
pulmonary rehabilitation (home, community, or hospitalised). It is therefore challenging to
draw a single conclusion to address whether using a nutritional supplement has additional
effects on exercise function, body composition, respiratory muscle function and quality of life
during pulmonary rehabilitation. Consequently, appropriately powered studies with suitable
designs and sample size to investigate the effect of nutritional support during PR in COPD
patients are still needed.
Exercise capacity has been used to quantify the direct effect of nutrition interventions,
and to predict mortality and morbidity in COPD patients and other diseases. In this
systematic review, the majority of studies demonstrated no improvement in exercise
outcomes with nutritional supplementation, compared to PR alone. There were four RCTs
with negative findings at low risk of bias (24, 25, 34, 35) which tested carbohydrate, B12,
creatine, and carnitine supplementation and just one small RCT with a positive finding which
used a complex supplement twice a day composed of 200 kilocalories, 60% carbohydrates,
15% protein, 25% fat, and 248 μg of omega-3 PUFAs 0.6 with vitamins A, C, E.
Body composition is one of the outcome measures that might be expected to improve when
using nutritional supplement in COPD patients. Being underweight is associated with an
increased risk of mortality in COPD.(13) Low body weight is observed in between 25% and
40% of COPD patients. Among those, 25% have moderate to severe weight loss and 35%
have extremely low fat-free mass.(46) In this systematic review, we found that complex
nutritional supplementation during PR may increase body weight in population with normal
body weight, but we did not find evidence that this occurred with carnitine or creatine.
Importantly, improvements in body weight and FFM using nutritional supplementation

during pulmonary rehabilitation appear to occur especially in depleted, malnourished, and
muscle-wasted patients.(24, 27, 30, 32)
In recent years, researchers have paid attention to the assessment of functional
outcomes such as quadriceps muscle strength and handgrip strength. Handgrip strength and
quadriceps muscle strength are valid measurements of peripheral muscles strength, and are
associated with mortality, morbidity and increased length of hospital stay.(47, 48) In this
systematic review, RCTs at low risk of bias did not support the concept that creatine, high
carbohydrates, and L-carnitine increase peripheral muscle strength, and we found conflicting
evidence for the benefits of complex supplements with one study having positive and another
study negative results.
Respiratory muscle weakness in COPD patients may be due to several factors such as
acute exacerbations, systemic inflammation, and malnutrition.(49) It has been suggested that
nutritional supplements may improve respiratory muscle function. In this systematic review,
we found two studies reporting that nutritional supplementation in addition to pulmonary
rehabilitation had an extra benefit in improving respiratory muscle function. This was
demonstrated by measuring maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures. The effects were
seen only on inspiratory measures, and the authors did not speculate on why they thought this
was.
Quality of life may be affected through multiple mechanisms in COPD. The available
evidence from this review included one small study demonstrating an improvement in QOL
using a complex supplement, and two studies with negative results one of which used
creatine and one of which also used a complex supplement.

To our knowledge, this is the only review that reports the effect of nutritional
supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation in stable COPD patients on clinically
important outcomes. PR is an evidence-based and cost-effective intervention in COPD and
thus maximising outcomes is of great interest to clinicians and patients alike. We have
carefully searched the literature and registered our review in advance on PROSPERO. Three
independent researchers examined the titles and abstracts for inclusion. Potential limitations
are that we only accessed studies in English, and the inherent variation in the included
studies, many of which had risk of bias for example with inadequate sample size or absence
of a power calculation, variation in outcomes measured, variety in study design, or different
pulmonary rehabilitation protocols. It was noticed that there was a variation in the type of
supplement either caloric or non-caloric and powder, liquid or tablets. We also observed a
variation in the amount, contents and the duration of using supplements.

CONCLUSION
This is the first systematic review to report the value of nutritional supplementation
during PR in patients with COPD. It is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion due to the
heterogeneity of the supplements, rehabilitation programmes and outcome measures studied.
However, nutritional supplements may enhance the benefit of PR programmes, which would
be of considerable benefit to those living with COPD. Not all studies showed positive results
and there is a real need for further well-designed and rigorous research to address this area.
This is particularly true in weight-losing and/or malnourished patients with COPD who are at
the highest risk of poor outcomes.
