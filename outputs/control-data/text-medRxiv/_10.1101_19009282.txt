immunogenicity of R21 administered alone and with the saponin-based adjuvant, Matrix-

56

weeks apart. We subsequently conducted a Phase Ib randomised, controlled trial in West

57

African adults.

Findings

events were mild. Reactogenicity was significantly lower in Burkinabe than UK vaccinees

60

(p<0.0001). Antibody responses increased significantly 28 days after the 2nd vaccination in

61

UK volunteers. Antibody responses to R21 in all dose groups (2μg, 10μg and 50μg) were

62

comparable to those of 50μg RTS,S/AS01B in malaria-naïve adults at 28 days after final

63

vaccination. The 10μg dose induced more durable responses, with 2-fold higher NANP-

64

specific IgG titres at 6 months compared with the 2μg and 50μg dose groups. R21 also

boosted baseline humoral responses in Burkinabe adults with well-maintained responses

suggesting natural boosting.

INTRODUCTION

73

Malaria remains one of the leading infectious causes of mortality worldwide and is caused

74

by four species of the Plasmodium parasite in humans. Plasmodium falciparum

75

predominantly affects children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa and caused an

76

estimated 219 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2017 (1). Increases in the distribution of

77

long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), widespread deployment of rapid diagnostic tests to

78

target treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy and use of intermittent

79

preventive treatment in pregnant women have all contributed to a reduction in cases since

80

2010 (2). However, progress has been highly variable, with 15 countries in sub-Saharan

81

Africa and India experiencing nearly 80% of malaria cases and since 2016, cases have

82

increased in the 10 African countries with the greatest disease burden (1). Recent advances

83

in control interventions include seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis (SMC) programs with

84

nearly 16 million children receiving treatment in 2017 (3). The emergence and spread of

85

resistance to artemisinins (4, 5) and insecticides (6), threatens malaria control efforts even

86

further and so there remains an urgent need for a durable, efficacious malaria vaccine.

87

The most advanced malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S/AS01B, designed in 1987, elicits

88

antibodies to the pre-erythrocytic circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and has completed testing

89

in a large Phase III clinical trial (7-10). The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Strategic

90

Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory

91

Committee (MPAC), recommended further evaluation in a Malaria Vaccine Implementation

92

Programme (MVIP), which has started in Malawi, Ghana and Kenya co-ordinated by WHO

93

(11, 12). Though RTS,S has demonstrated significant vaccine efficacy of 46% in children after

94

three doses (7), this falls short of the goals set down by the Malaria Vaccine Technology

95

Roadmap - development of a suitable vaccine with at least 75% durable efficacy against

96

clinical malaria by 2030 (13).

97

CSP, which is pivotal in sporozoite development and invasion of hepatocytes, has long been

98

considered as one of the leading pre-erythrocytic antigens for the development of a malaria

99

vaccine. R21 has been designed and developed at the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford

100

since 2012 (14). This is an improved RTS,S construct, containing recombinant particles

101

expressing the central repeat and the C-terminus of the CSP fused to the Hepatitis B surface

102

antigen (HBsAg). It does not contain the four-fold excess of unfused HBsAg protein present

103

in RTS,S, which was required for particle formation(15). CSP comprises around 20% of the

104

total protein content in RTS,S and a large proportion of the antibody response induced by

105

RTS,S is towards the HBsAg (16). In contrast, R21 contains only fusion protein moieties, with

106

no unfused HBsAg, which increases the density of CSP antigen on the virus-like particle

107

(VLP). As a result, a 50μg dose of R21 contains about 25μg of CSP antigen compared with

108

10μg of CSP in a standard adult 50μg dose of RTS,S. This was achieved by expressing R21 in

109

an improved yeast expression system, Pichia pastoris, rather than in Saccharomyces

110

cerevisiae. At the C-terminus of R21, a four amino acid sequence was added, EPEA (C-tag),

111

for efficient immunochromatographic purification of R21. This sequence is found many

112

times in the proteome of malaria parasites and humans but had not, to our knowledge,

113

been used previously in any vaccine administered to humans (17).

114

In murine studies, R21 predominantly induced antibodies to CSP rather than HBsAg with

115

comparable CSP immunogenicity and

117

(expressing the Plasmodium falciparum CSP homologue) performed in mice showed that

118

R21 adjuvanted with Matrix-MTM(MM) elicited 87.5 to 100% sterile protection (14).

119

Adjuvants can enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of protein or VLP-based vaccines,

120

and MM is an attractive relatively novel vaccine adjuvant for this purpose. As with other

121

matrix formulations of Quillaja saponins, it shows acceptable safety in large numbers of

122

recipients (18), and the ability to enhance both cellular and humoral immune responses to a

123

range of antigens (19-24). In addition to the saponin, QS21, the AS01 adjuvant used with

124

RTS,S also contains 50 μg of the immunostimulant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). No such

125

TLR4 ligand is present in the MM adjuvant which could lead to an improved safety profile

126

and lower costs of manufacture. Therefore, we initially conducted a Phase I, first-in-human,

127

open-label clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of R21 administered alone

128

and with the novel saponin-based adjuvant, MM, in healthy UK volunteers. On the basis of

129

an encouraging safety profile and comparable humoral immunogenicity to RTS,S/AS01B, but

130

at the lower dose of 10μg, we tested this dose in Burkinabe adult volunteers and extended

131

the UK study to assess the immunogenicity of an even lower dose of 2μg R21.

133

METHODS

134

Study design and participants

135

The Phase Ia study was conducted in healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 50 years at

136

the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine at the University of Oxford and the

137

NIHR Imperial Clinical Research Facility, London in the United Kingdom.

138

Subsequently, the Phase Ib study was conducted in healthy Burkinabe adults aged between

139

18 and 45 years at the Centre National de Recherche et Formation sur le Paludisme (CNRFP)

140

research unit, Banfora in Burkina Faso. Details on trial site in Burkina are provided

141

elsewhere (25) . All participants provided written informed consent. The Phase Ia study was

142

an observational, open-label, first-in-human clinical trial of R21 at a range of doses. Eligible

143

participants were assigned to one of four groups and received three doses of R21 at either

144

2μg, 10μg or 50μg administered alone or formulated with Matrix-M (Figure 1). The first

145

three vaccinations in Groups 1-3 occurred in a staggered manner and interim safety reviews

146

were conducted by the local safety monitor prior to progression to the higher dose group.

147

The Phase Ib study was a single-blinded randomised, controlled trial assessing three doses

148

of R21 10μg administered with MM in Burkinabe adults against a saline placebo (Figure 1).

149

Despite single-blinding, investigators were unaware of group assignment throughout the

150

study duration. The Phase 1b study only commenced after a satisfactory Data Safety and

151

Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of the interim safety report for the 10μg and 50μg dose of

152

R21 given to volunteers in the Phase Ia study. Volunteers were randomised to receive

153

R21/MM or normal saline placebo. Full details regarding the study conduct are provided in

154

the protocols for the two studies, which are available online (26, 27).

155

The Phase Ia study protocol and associated documents were reviewed and approved by the

156

UK National Research Ethics Service, Committee South Central–Berkshire B (Ref:

157

15/SC/0386), the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (Ref:

158

21584/0352/001-0001), and the Oxford University Clinical Trials and Research Governance

159

team, who independently monitored compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The

160

trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT02572388) and an independent local

161

safety monitor provided safety oversight. The study protocol for the Phase Ib study was

162

approved by the Burkina Faso regulatory authorities, The Burkina Faso Ministry of Health

163

Ethical Committee for Biomedical Research (2014-10-118), the institutional review board of

164

the Centre National de Recherche et de Formation sur le Paludisme (CIB/CNRFP), and

165

Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC Reference: 36-15). The trial was

166

registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Ref: NCT02925403). An independent DSMB provided

167

oversight and reviewed preliminary safety data before vaccinations commenced. The trial

168

was monitored by an external organization (Margan Clinical Research Organization). Both

169

studies were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) and

170

the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

171

Procedures

172

R21 was thawed to room temperature and administered intramuscularly into the deltoid

173

muscle within 1 hour of removal from the freezer, either alone, or mixed with an adjuvant at

174

the bedside, immediately prior to administration.

175

Volunteers were observed for 60 minutes following vaccine administration. In the Phase Ia

176

study, follow-up visits were scheduled for days 1, 7, 14, 29, 35, 42, 57, 63, 70, 84 and 238,

177

with an additional visit at day 3 post-vaccination for the first three volunteers in Groups 1-3.

178

All participants recorded their temperature and any solicited local and systemic adverse

179

events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited adverse events for 28 days post-

180

vaccination using an electronic diary. A review of solicited and unsolicited adverse events

181

(AEs) occurred at each follow-up visit. Safety bloods including full blood count, renal

182

function and liver function tests were done on visits at day 0, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63, 84 and 238.

183

In the Phase Ib study, volunteers were visited at home daily for 6 days after each vaccination

184

by a field worker for assessment and recording of any solicited and unsolicited AEs in diary

185

cards. They were also seen in clinic at day 7 and day 28 after each vaccination and attended

186

a final follow up visit one year after enrolment. Safety bloods including full blood count,

187

creatinine and alanine aminotransaminase were done in clinic at day 0, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63, 84,

188

140 and 365. Severity grading of AEs and the assignment of a causal relationship for AEs

189

were conducted according to predefined guidelines stated in the protocol, which were

190

harmonised across both clinical trials for grading of solicited AEs. For unsolicited AEs,

191

MedDRA (MedDRA® the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology) was used

192

for coding in the UK clinical trial. In the Burkinabe trial, the DAIDS AE grading table was used

193

(28).

194

Antibody responses measured by anti-NANP IgG ELISA were performed at all time points

195

and IgG antibody avidity was assessed by sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN)-displacement ELISA.

196

To assess whether antibodies to the C-tag used for R21 purification were induced by

197

vaccination, N-terminal biotinylated peptides were constructed for the C-tag (EPEA), the C-

198

tag plus the four adjacent amino acids in the R21 construct (WVYIEPEA) forming an 8-mer

199

and the C-tag plus the eleven adjacent amino acids in the R21 construct (LPIFFCLWVYIEPEA)

200

forming a 15-mer. For hepatitis B, antibodies to the HBsAg were measured using the Abbot

201

Architect 2000i chemiluminescent micro-particle immunoassay (CMIA). Antibody

202

concentration of 100.0mIU/ml or greater was considered positive. Only groups 1, 2 and 3

203

were assayed for C-tag antibodies. Ex-vivo IFN-γ ELISpot responses to CSP were assessed on

204

samples from day 0, 42 and 84, (ELISpots were not performed in the Burkinabe cohort as

205

PBMC were not collected). Full details of the methods for all assays are provided in the

206

supplementary appendix.

207

Outcomes

208

The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of R21 with and without

209

adjuvant MM in healthy UK and Burkinabe volunteers. The primary outcome measures

210

included occurrence of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 7

211

days following the vaccination, occurrence of unsolicited AEs for 28 days following the

212

vaccination, change from baseline for safety laboratory measures and occurrence of serious

213

AEs during the whole study duration. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and

214

humoral immunogenicity of R21 with and without adjuvant MM in healthy UK volunteers

215

and humoral immunogenicity in Burkinabe volunteers. The IgG response to the NANP repeat

216

region was the primary immunogenicity readout, as this measure is associated with efficacy

217

of RTS,S/AS01B (29).

218

Statistical analysis

219

Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism version 8.11 for Mac (GraphPad Software Inc.,

220

California, USA) and Stata 10.0 (Statacorp LP, Texas, USA). Medians with interquartile ranges

221

for each group are described. Kruskal-Wallis analysis and the Friedman test were used to

222

compare peak immune responses with baseline. Significance testing of differences between

223

two groups used Mann-Whitney analysis. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs analysis was used to

224

compare between time points within groups. A chi-squared test for trend was used to

compare the safety data between different groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered

226

statistically significant.

RESULTS

239

Study Populations

240

The Phase 1a study in the UK was performed between the 1st October 2015 and 3rd January

241

2017, and 31 of the 75 volunteers who were screened for eligibility were enrolled in the UK

242

study. One volunteer in Group 1 withdrew after their first vaccination and was replaced.

243

One Group 2 volunteer withdrew after their third vaccination. Two volunteers in Group 3

244

withdrew after their first vaccination and were not replaced, at withdrawal there were no

245

ongoing AEs and safety bloods were normal. All remaining volunteers completed follow-up.

246

The Phase 1b study in Burkina Faso was performed from 26th August 2016 to 28th September

247

2017. 13 of the 23 participants who were screened for eligibility were enrolled. Eight

248

volunteers completed follow-up after receiving three doses of 10μg R21/MM in addition to

249

four volunteers who received a saline placebo. One participant in the placebo group was

250

lost to follow-up after the first dose and was replaced. Participant flow in the two clinical

251

trials is summarised in Figure 1 and demographic data are summarised in Table 1.

256

No serious adverse reactions (SARs) or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions

257

(SUSARs) occurred. Two SAEs occurred; the first was deemed unlikely and the second not

258

related to vaccination. Solicited local and systemic AEs in the first 7 days after each

259

vaccination related to R21 vaccination in the UK population are shown in Figure 2 and in

260

Supplementary Table 1. The majority of AEs reported were mild in severity and self-limiting.

261

As expected, the addition of MM increased the reactogenicity of the 50μg dose compared

262

with administration of 50μg of R21 alone. There was a significant trend for more

263

Chi-squared test for trend across doses) where minimal reactogenicity was observed.

265

Vaccine site pain was the most common local AE and was predominantly mild in severity.

266

One volunteer in Group 1 reported a mild fever (37.7°C) and another volunteer in Group 1

267

reported a moderate fever (38.1°C). Both occurred after the 2nd vaccination and resolved

268

within 24 hours. One volunteer in Group 2 reported a fever of 39°C associated with a

269

constellation of flu-like symptoms, eight days after their first vaccination, which resolved

270

within 24 hours. Severe AEs were only reported in the 50μg R21/MM group by three

271

volunteers and resolved within 48 hours.

272

Local and systemic AEs to 10μg R21 adjuvanted with MM in Burkinabe adults are shown in

273

Figure 3. Very few solicited systemic AEs were reported and most local AEs were mild in

274

nature with overall reactogenicity was significantly reduced compared to UK volunteers

275

receiving the same dose, summarised in Table 2 and S2 (p<0.0001, Chi-squared test). No

276

volunteers reported severe AEs. Vaccine site pain was again the most commonly reported

277

local AE. There were no episodes of fever associated with vaccination in the Burkinabe

278

cohort. No solicited AEs were recorded in the saline placebo group.

Furthermore, the reactogenicity profile observed in the 50μg R21/MM group is significantly

reduced (p < 0.0001, Pearson’s chi-squared test for trend) compared to that observed in a

288

previous clinical trial conducted in our institute using the same AE grading criteria, where

289

volunteers received three doses of 50μg RTS,S/AS01B given four weeks apart (30). This was

290

mainly due to a significant reduction in the number of systemic AEs reported with a higher

291

incidence of moderate and severe AEs reported by volunteers receiving RTS,S/AS01B (Table

292

are tabulated in Table S4. In the Burkinabe cohort, all unsolicited AEs were deemed unlikely

or unrelated to vaccination (Table S5). A higher frequency of laboratory AEs were observed

in the Burkinabe cohort in both the R21/MM and saline placebo vaccinated groups (Table

Immunogenicity

302

Humoral responses

303

IgG antibody titres to the NANP repeat region of the CSP antigen were measured by ELISA in

304

the same laboratory by the same operator for both trials. In the UK cohort, addition of the

305

Matrix-M adjuvant markedly increased antibody levels compared with R21 administered

306

alone. Increasing titres of NANP-specific IgG were detected with increasing doses of R21

307

after the first and second vaccinations, however there was no significant difference

308

between dose groups after the third immunisation (Kruskal-Wallis analyses, p=0.02, p=0.04

309

and p=0.12 at D28, D56 and D84, respectively, Figure 4A and C). At day 238, titres were

310

higher in the 10μg dose group than in the 50μg and 2μg groups (Kruskal-Wallis test with

311

Dunn’s multiple comparison test, p=0.06, Figure 4A and C).

312

Based on the quantity of CSP contained in each vaccine, the 10μg dose of R21 is most similar

313

to the standard 50μg dose of RTS,S. IgG titres were compared to those in UK participants

314

receiving three 50μg doses of RTS,S in previous UK clinical trials at the Jenner Institute.

315

ELISA assays were run using the same protocol in the same laboratory by the same

316

operator. There was no evidence of a difference between the peak IgG response to three

317

10μg doses of R21 in MM to those induced by three 50μg doses of RTS,S/ AS01B (Mann-

318

Whitney test, p=0.5, Figure 4B) (30, 31). Avidity of IgG antibodies at the peak of the immune

319

response did not vary between either dose of R21 in MM or compared to vaccination with

320

RTS,S (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.6, Figure 4D).

321

In the Burkinabe cohort, pre-vaccination titres to CSP were higher than in UK participants

322

due to malaria exposure. Responses to vaccination did not differ significantly between the

323

two cohorts after the first two vaccinations, however the third dose of R21 failed to boost

324

responses in the Burkinabe cohort, and as a consequence, titres were significantly lower at

325

D84, four weeks after the third dose (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.02, Figure 4E) compared to

326

UK vaccinees. By D140, responses in the Burkinabe R21/MM cohort had increased

327

significantly from D84 (Wilcoxon matched-pairs 2-tailed, p=0.008), and were significantly

328

higher than those in the placebo group at D140 and D365 (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.004

329

D140, p=0.04 D365). Although titres were lower at D84 in the Burkinabe cohort than the UK,

330

antibody avidity was significantly higher (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.001, Figure 4F). The

331

avidity of the antibody response also increased significantly after vaccination in the

332

Burkinabe cohort (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.008). The induction by R21/MM of high avidity

333

antibodies, and initial evidence of boosting through natural malaria exposure in Burkinabe

334

adults, with antibody titres comparable to those observed in UK vaccinees at D365, is

335

interesting, particularly as it has been difficult to detect evidence of significant immune

336

boosting by natural malaria exposure in RTS,S/AS01B vaccinees in malaria-exposed or semi-

337

immune adults (32, 33).

338

The functional activity of CSP-specific antibodies was assessed in vitro by measuring blocking

339

of sporozoite invasion into a human hepatoma cell line in the presence of serum from

340

vaccinees (inhibition of sporozoite invasion, ISI assay). Prior to vaccination, serum from UK

341

participants did not demonstrate ISI activity, while serum from Burkinabe volunteers

342

demonstrated up to 50% inhibition (p=0.02, Mann-Whitney, Figure 5A). Vaccination with

343

R21/MM significantly increased the ISI activity from baseline to D84 in the UK cohort

344

(p=0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs) and there was a trend towards higher ISI activity in the

345

Burkinabe participants at D84 than in the UK participants (p=0.06, Mann-Whitney). An

346

association was detected between antibody titre and ISI activity in the Burkinabe cohort

347

(r=0.81, p=0.07, Spearman’s rank test, Figure 5B), but not in the UK cohort.

348

Between 40% and 50% of participants in each UK group were seropositive to HBsAg prior to

349

R21 vaccination, presumably due to previous vaccination against Hepatitis B. Of those that

350

were seronegative at vaccination, 0, 17% and 50% of volunteers seroconverted for HBsAg

351

after 3 doses of R21/MM in the 2μg, 10μg and 50μg dose groups, respectively. This is in

352

contrast to vaccination with 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01B which induced seroconversion in 100%

353

of seronegative vaccinees in a Belgian study (34) (Figure 5C). In the Burkinabe cohort,

354

seroconversion was detected in only 1 of 7 (17%) volunteers that were seronegative prior to

355

vaccination.

356

A four amino acid label (EPEA) was added to the C-terminal of the R21 construct (C-tag) to

357

facilitate protein purification during biomanufacture. Antibody response to the C–tag was

358

assessed by ELISA in the UK cohort only. C-tag IgG responses were not induced by

359

vaccination with R21, although one participant had a very weak response to EPEA pre-

360

vaccination, which was not detected post-vaccination at Day 84 (Figure 5D).

DISCUSSION

369

We report here the safety and immunogenicity of the first-in-human administration of the

370

novel malaria vaccine candidate, R21, administered with the saponin-based adjuvant, MM

371

in UK and African adults. This vaccination approach was safe and very well tolerated with

372

very low doses inducing high antibody levels, comparable to those previously associated

373

with protection in humans induced by other malaria anti-sporozoite vaccines. The

374

reactogenicity profile of 50μg R21/MM was significantly improved compared to the

375

standard adult 50μg RTS,S/AS01B dose in healthy adult UK volunteers (30) and importantly,

376

post-vaccination fever was not detected. An effective vaccine will be an essential tool in the

377

malaria elimination and eradication efforts and the absence of fever is a significant benefit

378

in the context of mass administration campaigns. Minimal reactogenicity was detected in

379

African adults and this was significantly reduced compared to UK adults at a dose of 10μg

380

R21/MM.

381

Humoral responses observed to the conserved central NANP repeat region are comparable

382

to previous RTS,S/AS01B data from two clinical trials conducted in the UK where the same

383

ELISA was used. The humoral response is predominantly responsible for the efficacy of

384

RTS,S/AS01B against malaria infection (36). It is therefore encouraging that comparable

385

humoral responses are elicited at 28 days after the third vaccination even at the very low

386

dose of 2μg and 10μg. This could have significant dose-sparing and cost-saving implications

387

for vaccine production.

388

R21/MM administered at doses of 10μg and 50μg did not result in significant boosting of

389

the humoral response after the third vaccination compared to the peak response after the

390

second vaccination. Though RTS,S is currently generally given in a three dose schedule,

391

administered 4 weeks apart, preliminary studies with RTS,S assessed regimens where the

392

third dose was delayed to 24-28 weeks (15, 37). Though these studies did not show

393

significant boosting of the humoral response with a delayed third dose, higher level efficacy

394

of 86% was observed in malaria-naïve adults who received RTS,S/AS02 given at 0, 1 and 7

395

months (37). However, these volunteers had also received one-fifth of the vaccine and

396

adjuvant at the third administration due to earlier reactogenicity concerns. Studies in

397

African adults living in malaria endemic regions have shown that there is boosting of the

398

immune response after the third dose with a 0, 1 and 6 month schedule (38, 39). More

399

recently, Regules et al. revisited a delayed fractional (i.e. one fifth) dose with RTS,S/AS01B

400

where high level efficacy was again observed. This was associated with increased somatic

401

hypermutation and antibody avidity, rather than the magnitude of the humoral response

402

(40).

403

Durable antibody responses were observed at 6 months after the final vaccination. The

404

10μg dose elicited significantly higher titres compared with the 50μg dose at 6 months.

405

Though RTS,S/AS01B demonstrated short-term efficacy in malaria-naïve and endemic

406

populations, durable protective immunity is a hitherto unmet goal. It is well recognised that

407

the antibody responses to the CSP elicited by RTS,S/AS01B decay over time, which is

408

reflected in reduced vaccine efficacy (33, 41, 42). That a lower dose of protein should induce

19

409

a more durable response is of particular interest from an immunological perspective. In

410

other settings, higher priming antigen doses favour production of antigen-specific plasma

411

cells that only have a short lifespan, whereas lower doses can preferentially drive the

412

induction of immune memory (43, 44). A few of these plasma cells differentiate into long-

413

lived plasma cells (LLPC) and in the absence of subsequent antigen exposure; the proportion

414

of LLPC generated by a vaccine is predictive of the durability of the antibody response (45).

415

Antibody titres at 6-12 months after immunisation would reflect this as the initial short-

416

term plasma cell response would decline.

417

A successful malaria vaccine is needed to help reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in

418

over 30 million children born in malaria endemic regions of Africa each year, as well as for

419

disease control and eventual eradication efforts in other continents. For a four-dose

420

regimen, such as that under evaluation by MVIP, this would require at least 130 million

421

doses per annum for infants in Africa alone. The finding that R21 can induce comparable

422

immune responses to RTS,S using just a fifth to a 25th of the dose used by the RTS,S suggests

423

that substantial dose sparing should be possible reducing cost of goods and easing the

424

challenge of making hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine each year. The initial improved

425

safety profile of R21 observed with the Matrix-M adjuvant compared to the standard

426

RTS,S/AS01B regimen, along with good durability of immune response after the low dose

427

R21/MM is also encouraging. Furthermore, R21 is now being manufactured by the Serum

428

Institute of India, who are the world’s largest vaccine supplier by volume and supply 40% of

429

the vaccines funded by GAVI (46), increasing the potential to manufacture R21/MM on the

430

scale likely to be required for effective malaria control and eventual elimination.

431

In conclusion, these Phase I clinical trials showed that the novel malaria vaccine candidate,
