Abstract

18

Objectives: We examine long-term retention of adults, adolescents and children on antiretroviral

19

therapy under different HIV treatment guidelines in Malawi.

20

Design: Prospective cohort study.

21

Setting and participants: Adults and children starting ART between 2005 and 2015 in 21 health

22

facilities in southern Malawi.

23

Methods: We used survival analysis to assess retention at clinic level, Cox regression to examine risk

24

factors for loss to follow up, and competing risk analysis to assess long-term outcomes of people on

25

antiretroviral therapy (ART).

26

Results: We included 132,274 individuals in our analysis, totalling 270,256 person years of follow up

27

(PYFU; median per patient 1.3, interquartile range (IQR) 0.26 – 3.1), 62% were female and the

28

median age was 32 years. Retention on ART was lower in the first year on ART compared to

29

subsequent years for all guideline periods and age groups. Infants (0-3 years), adolescents and young

30

adults (15 -24 years) were at highest risk of LTFU. Comparing the different calendar periods of ART

31

initiation we found that retention improved initially, but remained stable thereafter.

32

Conclusion: Even though the number of patients and the burden on health care system increased

33

substantially during the study period of rapid ART expansion, retention on ART improved in the early

34

years of ART provision, but gains in retention were not maintained over 5 years on ART. Reducing

35

high attrition in the first year of ART should remain a priority for ART programs, and so should

36

addressing poor retention among adolescents, young adults and men.

Introduction

40

In 2014 UNAIDS released the “90-90-90” targets and antiretroviral therapy (ART) for prevention of

41

HIV transmission became key to the response to the global HIV epidemic [1]. With the “90-90-90”

42

targets UNAIDS aims to end the HIV epidemic by ensuring that the majority of people infected with

43

HIV are on effective ART and can no longer transmit the virus: by 2020, 90% of all people living with

44

HIV should know their status, 90% of people diagnosed should receive ART, and 90% of the people

45

on ART should achieve viral load suppression.

46

The latest World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that all people living with HIV should

47

initiate ART regardless of clinical or immunological stage facilitates early uptake of ART, but long-

48

term retention on ART is crucial for the success of the 90-90-90 strategy, as people who stop

49

treatment experience HIV replication and may acquire ART resistance and transmit the virus [2,3].

50

Therefore, treatment programs face the challenge to extend ART to all HIV-infected patients, and at

51

the same time retain the expanding number of patients on lifelong ART [4,5]. Studies suggest that

52

people who initiate ART in a less advanced stage of the disease have worse retention than those who

53

are sick when they begin therapy [6–8]. High rates of ART uptake among asymptomatic PLHIV due to

54

universal ART eligibility may thus lead to worse retention [9].

55

Several systematic reviews have shown that retention on ART is suboptimal and treatment programs

56

need to implement interventions to improve retention to meet UNAIDS targets [10–12]. Retention in

57

care is particularly challenging among adolescents [13,14], pregnant women, and their HIV-exposed

58

children [7,15] and the latest WHO guidelines promote differentiated care models to address the

59

different needs for HIV care services for diffent patient populations. Intervention to improve

60

retention that are targeted to specific populations including teen friendly services [16] or fewer clinic

61

visits for patients stable on ART [16] are promising interventions. Several studies have shown that

62

loss to follow-up is a substantial problem in Malawi’s ART programme, reported attrition is highest in

63

adolescents [13,14] and women who started ART in the Option B+ programme [7,8]. Most studies

64

have analyzed loss to follow-up in either adults or children and in limited geographical areas.

65
66

We examine retention in care by year of starting ART to assess the impact of expanded access to ART

67

on retention. We included patients from a large part of Malawi and from all age groups to identify

68

populations in the greatest need for tailored interventions to improve retention.

Methods

71

The Malawi ART programme

72

Malawi introduced free ART in 2004, using a public health approach that standardizes ART regimens

73

and clinically monitors patients for toxicity and treatment failure, in 2011 viral load (VL) monitoring

74

was introduced. Patients are followed monthly for the first 6 months, and every two or three months

75

thereafter. In 2003, Malawi issued the first national HIV management guidelines. Recommendations

76

for when to start ART, and which ART regimens should be used, have changed over time (S1 Table),

77

generally in line with WHO guidance. National guidelines were first revised in April 2006 (when the

78

CD4 threshold for ART eligibility changed from 200 to 250 cells/µl), and again in April 2008 (CD4

79

thershold remained at 250 cells/µl), July 2011 (CD4 threshold changed to 350cells/µl and all pregnant

80

and breastfeeding women became eligible for lifelong ART when Option B+ was introduced;

81

additionally lifelong ART for all children under 2 years was introduced), and in July 2014 (CD4

82

threshold changed to 500cells/µl) [17]. In May 2016 new guidelines were published, introducing

83

universal test-and-treat for all persons living with HIV. Between 2005 and 2011, large ART clinics

84

started using an electronic medical record system (EMRS) operated by the Baobab Health Trust

85

(www.baobabhealth.org) [18]. Recorded characteristics in the EMRS system at ART initiation include

86

sex, age, reason for starting ART (WHO clinical stage, CD4 cell count, pregnant or breastfeeding

87

women, age below 5 years). Registration and follow-up data for patients starting ART are routinely

88

collected. To minimize the risk of incorrectly documenting drug dispensation and visits, healthcare

89

workers used barcode scanners and recorded drug dispensation prospectively at the point of care

90

[18], except during occasional outages of the electronic system, when data were collected on paper

91

forms and entered into the system retrospectively. Tracing of patients lost is performed according to

92

policies published by the Ministry of Health of Malawi. Patients who missed an appointment and did

93

not return to the clinic for more than 60 days were traced by expert clients using phone calls or

94

home visits.

96

Inclusion criteria

97

We used data from 21 facilities with an EMRS in central and southern Malawi, which began initiating

98

patients on ART between 2004 and 2011, depending on the facility. We used data up to database

99

closures, which was between April 2015 and December 2015. We selected these facilities because

100

they were using the Baobab Health Antiretroviral Therapy (BART) EMRS. All treatment-naive children

101

and adults who started ART in this period at any of the included facilities were eligible for inclusion.

102

Patients initiating ART in the 6 months prior to database closure were not included in the analysis

103

since they would not be able to meet the criteria for becoming LTFU (i.e. not returning to the clinic

104

for more than 6 months).

105

Definitions and outcomes

106

We defined ART initiation as the first recorded dispensation of ART drugs, and baseline as the date of

107

ART initiation. ART refers to the use of a triple-drug combination therapy. We defined time periods

108

based on the introduction of new national HIV guidelines: from 1.1.2004 – 31.3.2006; 1.4.2006 –

109

31.3.2008; 1.4.2008–30.6.2011; 1.7.2011–30.06.2014 and 1.7.2014–01.05.2016. We combined the

110

first two guideline periods because relatively few patients were enrolled and eligibility criteria did

111

not change substantially (S1 Table).

112

We defined retention on ART as being alive and on ART. Patients were classified as not retained on

113

ART on the date they stopped treatment, they were lost to follow up (LTFU), or died. Patients

114

transferring to another clinic were censored at the date of transfer. Patients were classified as having

115

stopped treatment if they were known to be alive, but were no longer on ART. LTFU was defined as

116

not having returned to the clinic for more than six months [19,20]. Once classified as LTFU, patients

117

remain in this state even if they later returned to care to avoid bias caused by transient interruptions

118

[21]. The date of LTFU was defined as the day of the patient’s last visit to the clinic.

119

We used the STROBE cohort reporting guidelines. [22]

120

Statistical analyses

121

We used descriptive statistics to examine the characteristics of individuals at the start of ART. We

122

performed survival analyses to describe retention, LTFU, transfer-out, death, and stopping ART. We

123

followed patients from ART initiation until death, transfer out, treatment stop, or censored patients

124

administratively when they stopped being at risk of LTFU (i.e. six months before database closure).

125

First, we plotted crude retention percentages and 95% confidence intervals stratified by age at ART

126

initiation, sex, years on ART, and guideline period. Second, we plotted sub-distribution hazard

127

functions for the cumulative incidence of LTFU, transfer-out, death and stopping ART [23]. We

128

considered death, transfer-out, stopping ART and LTFU as competing events. Third, we used

129

univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to calculate unadjusted and adjusted

130

hazard ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for factors associated with LTFU. To meet the

131

proportional hazard assumptions, we split follow-up time in three periods (0-1 year, >1-2 years, >2-5

132

years and 6 -8 years on ART) and fitted different Cox models for each period. We adjusted the

133

analyses for age, sex, treatment guideline period at ART initiation and reason for starting ART. We

134

used cluster-based robust standard errors to account for clustering of patients within facilities. Data

135

were analysed with STATA 13.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX).

136

Ethical approval

137

The National Health Sciences Research Committee in Malawi and the Cantonal Ethics Committee of

138

Bern in Switzerland granted ethical approval for the study. Individual informed consent was waived

139

since we analyzed routinely collected data only.

Results

142

Baseline characteristics and study population

143

Between 2005 and 2015, 132,274 individuals met our inclusion criteria, totalling 270,256 person

144

years of follow up (PYFU; median per patient 1.3, Interquartile range (IQR) 0.26 – 3.1). We excluded

145

patients with prior ART experience (N=25,491), those who started ART after analysis closure

146

(N=4,254) and those with other inconsistencies in data (N=203). Characteristics of patients excluded

147

from the analysis were similar to those included, except that patients from central hospitals and

148

those who initiated ART in clinical stage III or IV were overrepresented among excluded patients (S2

149

Table). Median age at ART initiation was 32.5 years (IQR 26.3 – 39.6); 62% of patients were female.

150

Most patients (77.8%) started ART for their own health, and 16.6% were women starting ART under

151

Option B+. The reason for ART initiation was missing for 5.6% of participants. ART sites included 3

152

central hospitals, 13 district hospitals, 2 health centres, and 3 faith-based hospitals. The number of

153

sites increased from one site in 2005, to 21 in 2015. The number of included patients per site varied

154

from 688 to 25,809.

155

Median age at ART initiation decreased from 33.8 years in the period 2005-2008, to 31.8 during

156

2014-2015 (Table 1). The proportion of females who started ART increased from 57.9% to 62.5%,

157

peaking at 65.3% in 2011-2014, after Option B+ was introduced (Table 1). After this point,

158

approximately 25% of patients started ART under Option B+.

Retention on ART

164

By the end of the study period, 46% (60,582) of patients were retained on ART at the clinic where

165

they initated treatment, 16% (20,868) had transferred elsewhere, 4.6% (6,040) had died, 33.1%

166

(43,766) were LTFU, and 0.7% (1,018) had stopped ART.

167

Fig 1 shows crude retention on ART for different age groups and guideline periods in the first (A),

168

second (B) and fifth (C) year on ART. Retention on ART differed between age groups and between

169

guideline periods. In the first year on ART, retention improved from the first to the second guideline

170

period for males and females. For male participants retention improved thereafter, with the highest

171

retention observed in the most recent time period. Whereas for female participants this trend was

172

only visible for the older participants (age goups 45–54 and >55 years), for those aged 15–24

173

retention decreased with the introduction of Option B+ in 2011. Retention in adolescents was lower

174

than in other age groups, for both males and females. Among those retainted on ART for the first

175

year, retention in the second year on ART was similar between guideline periods, and those aged 15-

176

24 had lower retention than other age groups. Retention during the first year of ART was lower than

177

in the second year of ART for all age groups and guideline periods. For those retained on ART by the

178

end of year 2, retention in year 3-5 on ART were lower for men than for women. The drop in

179

retention for those aged 15-24 nearly disappeared for female participants but remained prominent

180

for males (Fig 1).

Risk factors for LTFU

188

Table 2 shows the risk of LTFU for different patient groups, stratified by duration on ART. There was

189

no difference between males and females in the univariable model for the first and second year on

190

ART. During years 2-5 on ART, females had a lower risk of becoming LTFU than males (HR 0.85, 95%

191

CI 0.78-0.93) and this difference persisted during the years 6-8. After adjusting for guideline period,

192

age at ART start and reason for starting ART, females had a lower risk of LTFU in all periods after ART

193

initiation compared to males (aHR 1st year 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 – 0.78; 2nd year 0.73, 95% CI 0.68-0.79;

2-5 years 0.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.84, 6-8 years 0.62 95% CI 0.55-0.69) (Table 2). The risk of LTFU

195

decreased from the first guideline period to the second for the first year of ART (HR 0.81, 95% CI

196

0.67-0.98), this difference persisted in the multivariable model (aHR 0.80, 0.66-0.97). There were

197

only small differences in LTFU risk between guideline periods for all years on ART (Table 2). Infants

198

aged 0-2 years and young adults aged 15-24 years had the highest risk of LTFU during the years 1-5

199

on ART in both the univariable and the multivariable model. During the years 6-8 children aged 6-14

200

had the highest risk of LTFU. Participants initiating ART when they were 35 years or older, had a

201

lower risk of LTFU compared to those aged 25–34 years. In the first year of ART women starting ART

202

due to Option B+ had a higher risk of LTFU compared to those who initiated for their own health (HR

203

1.90, 95% CI 1.65-2.19; and aHR 1.84,95% CI 1.61-2.11); after one year these differences

204

disappeared.

Competing risks analysis

215

Overall retention on ART was 70.0% at 12 months after ART initiation, 65.2% after 2 years, and 50.7%

216

after 5 years. Fig 2 shows the competing risks analysis. Most patients who defaulted from care were

217

LTFU in the first year. In the competing risk analysis death was more common among the oldest age

218

group (>55 years of age) and children compared to those aged 25-34, while LTFU was more common

219

among adolescents and young adults.

Discussion

225

We compared retention on ART for a large group of patients over a period of 10 years of ART

226

provision in central and southern Malawi. Even though the number of patients and the burden on

227

the health care system increased substantially during the study period of rapid ART expansion, we

228

found that retention on ART improved in the early years of ART, and stabilized thereafter. Retention

229

on ART at the clinic varied between different age groups, and was lowest among infants and young

230

adults aged 15–24. Males were at higher risk of LTFU than females throughout the study period,

231

despite the introduction of Option B+ in 2011, which increased the number of females starting ART.

232

Older PLHIV (>55 years) were more likely to die than younger persons, irrespective of duration on

233

ART.

234

Strengths of this study are the large sample size, and the ability to compare data over a long time

235

period of HIV treatment and guideline changes during strong program expansion. Our study also has

236

several limitations. All clinics that have an EMRS have large patient populations. One previous study

237

found that LTFU was higher in sites that used EMRS than in sites that did not and our results may

238

therefore not be representative for all HIV clinics in Malawi [8]. We probably underestimated

239

retention on ART, since patients who we recorded as LTFU may be in care elsewhere after silent or

240

undocumented transfer [24,25]. A study in Lilongwe, Malawi found that 40% of patients recorded as

241

LTFU, who were alive and successfully traced were in care elsewhere [26]. Underreporting of

242

mortality is very common in ART programs [27] and some patients LTFU had probably died [28]. In

243

Lilongwe, an analysis of a tracing programme for the years 2006 to 2010 revealed that 30% of

244

patients LTFU had died [29]. Death among those LTFU might be higher in earlier time periods, when

245

many started ART with advance HIV, compared to later periods. We do not know why people were

246

LTFU, but tracing studies found that the most frequent reasons for not returning to care were

247

undocumented transfer, stopping ART, and death [24]. Tracing studies among children are scarce, in

248

a systematic review of outcomes of HIV-positive patients LTFU only 4 of 30 studies included children

249

[30]. They found no difference in mortality, undocumented transfers and interruption of ART

250

between children and adults. Since our study relied on routine, operational data collection by

251

caregivers who were often overburdened, some data may be incorrect. The frequency of data errors

252

is probably low, due to regular supervision visits by teams from the Ministry of Health and its HIV

253

care stakeholders, and because of our additional logical checks after data entry. Our dataset only

254

included variables required for national monitoring, so we could not consider socioeconomic, some

255

anthropometric and other variables that are known to be associated with patients’ ART outcomes

256

[31].

257

Our results confirm and extend those of earlier studies of retention on ART in Malawi and sub-

258

Saharan Africa. Retention in the first year of ART was similar in a study from Malawi covering the

259

time period between 2004 and 2007 [20]. After 12 months of follow up they found that 69.5% of

260

patients were on ART at the same facility. Another study from northern Malawi, covered a

261

comparable timeframe to ours (from 2005 – 2012) and found similar retention rates in an area of

262

lower HIV prevalence [32]. Studies from Ethiopia, reporting data from 2005 – 2011 found comparable

263

retention rates [33,34]. A 2015 systematic review of retention on ART between 2008-2013 found that

264

annual attrition decreased after 24 months, and retention was 65%–70% after 3 years on ART [10].

265

Some studies in sub-Saharan Africa identified the same baseline characteristics that predicted

266

attrition in our analysis (younger age [32] and male gender[35]). Our finding that retention on ART is

267

particularly low in adolescents was also highlighted by other studies from Sub-Saharan Africa [36–

268

39].

269
270

Malawi has successfully scaled up ART and sustained initial retention levels in those starting ART

271

more recently. However, there are differences in retention between different patient populations,

272

and patients who are not retained or have inadequate adherence to treatment are at a high risk of

273

viral rebound and drug resistance [40,41]. Programs should consider implementing feasible,

274

evidence-based interventions to promote adherence and retention, including adherence clubs,

275

adherence counseling, text message reminders by telephone, and treatment supporters [42,43].

276

In conclusion, in central and southern Malawi, retention on ART did not change much over time,

277

even though the number of patients on ART increased rapidly over time and patients starting ART

278

were increasingly asymptomatic and in good health. Since mortality on ART was higher among older

279

participants, it should be further investigated whether mortality in this group is higher compared to

280

HIV negative people of comparable age. Reducing high attrition in the first year of ART should remain

281

a priority for ART programs, and so should addressing poor retention among adolescents, young

282

adults and men.
