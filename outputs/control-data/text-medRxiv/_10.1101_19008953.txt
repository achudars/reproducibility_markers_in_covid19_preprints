ABSTRACT

28

Background

29

The objective of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations for

30

physical activity (PA) and PA promotion for German adults (18–65 years) with

31

noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).

32

Methods

33

The PA recommendations were developed based on existing PA recommendations and

34

using a three-phased process. In phase 1, systematic literature searches were conducted

35

for current PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions (osteoarthrosis of the hip

36

and knee, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable ischemic heart disease, stroke,

37

clinical depression, and chronic non-specific back pain). In phase 2, the PA

38

recommendations were evaluated on the basis of 28 quality criteria. High-quality

39

recommendations were identified, and a content analysis was conducted on these

40

recommendations. In phase 3, the findings of the content analysis were summarised, and

41

PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions were deducted. The seven

42

recommendations

43

recommendations for adults with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In relation to the

44

recommendations for PA promotion, a systematic literature review was conducted on

45

papers that reviewed the efficacy/effectiveness of interventions for PA promotion in

46

adults with NCDs.

47

Results

48

The German Recommendations for Physical Activity state that adults with NCDs

49

should, over the course of a week, should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity

50

aerobic PA, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA, or a combination of both.

51

Furthermore, muscle-strengthening activities should be performed at least twice a week.

52

The promotion of PA among adults with NCDs should be theory-based, specifically

53

target PA behaviour, and be tailored to the respective target group. In this context, and

54

as an intervention method, exercise referral schemes are one of the more promising

55

methods of promoting PA in adults with NCDs.

56

Conclusion

57

The development of evidence-based recommendations for PA and PA promotion is an

58

important step in terms of the initiation and implementation of actions for PA-related

59

health promotion in Germany. The German Recommendations for PA and PA

60

promotion inform adults affected by NCDs and health professionals on how much PA

61

would be optimal for adults with NCDs. Additionally, the recommendations provide

62

professionals entrusted in PA promotion the best strategies and interventions to raise low

63

PA levels in adults with NCDs. The formulation of specific PA recommendations for

64

adults with NCDs and their combination with recommendations on PA promotion is a

65

unique characteristic of the German recommendations.

INTRODUCTION

74

The high prevalence of physical inactivity is a global problem [1, 2] that contributes to

75

increasing morbidity, higher rates of premature death [3], and increased economic costs

76

[4]. In this context, the development of strategies to promote physical activity (PA) is an

77

important challenge, both globally and nationally. A method of combatting high levels

78

of inactivity is the development of PA guidelines. PA guidelines define the amount of

79

health-enhancing activity through which significant health gains can be achieved [e.g.

80

5]. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union have urged

81

their member states to develop their own recommendations on a national level [5–8].

82

Even though many nations have developed these recommendations in recent years,

83

including Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Switzerland, and Australia [e.g. 9, 10], the

84

resulting guidelines predominantly focus on age-stratified target groups of children and

85

adolescent, adults, and older adults. Thus far, the target group of individuals with

86

noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has received scant consideration.

87
88

The fact that there are hardly any national PA recommendations for adults with NCDs is

89

surprising and problematic for several reasons. The ever-growing prevalence of NCDs

90

[11] has become a global health issue. For most countries, adults with NCDs comprise

91

one of the largest population groups. In Germany, for example, four out of every 10

92

adults report themselves as having at least one NCD [12]. PA has been proven to not

93

only aid in the prevention [13] but also in the treatment of NCDs [14]. For more than 25

94

NCDs – such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, ischaemic heart disease, and

95

clinical depression – PA is viewed as a medicine [15]; a medicine that positively

96

influences symptoms and comorbidities, physical fitness and health-related quality of

97

life [15]. Therefore, WHO [16] states that regular PA is the 'best buy' in controlling

98

NCDs. Accordingly, WHO [5] specifies that their PA recommendations that are relevant

99

for all healthy adults ‘also apply to adults with chronic noncommunicable conditions not

100

related to mobility such as hypertension or diabetes.’ The PA recommendations of WHO

101

are based on a vast body of evidence, and they have an immensely positive influence on

102

global actions regarding PA promotion. However, a limitation of WHO’s

103

recommendations is that their underlying scientific evidence is mainly based on the

104

general population, meaning that specific scientific evidence regarding the health effects

105

of PA on adults with NCDs has not been systematically considered. This is problem if

106

adults with NCDs would need other PA and different levels of PA to optimally promote

107

their health. This lack of disease-specific evidence in PA recommendations also applies

108

to nations that base their PA recommendations for adults with NCDs on WHO

109

recommendations (e.g. Austria, Ireland, and Sweden). Other countries in Europe (e.g.

110

Netherlands) excluded studies in people with NCDs in developing their national PA

111

recommendations but state that the recommendations are useful for numerous specific

112

groups of people with a chronic condition [17]. And some countries (e.g. Belgium,

113

Greece, Spain, and Great Britain) do not make specific exercise recommendations for

114

adults with NCDs [11]. This means that for many countries, there exists no evidence-

115

based health-promoting PA recommendations for the large group of adults with NCDs.

116

Thus, neither the adults affected by NCDs nor the health professionals involved in PA

117

promotion know how much PA would be optimal.

118
119

Even more uncommon than missing PA recommendations, however, is to identify

120

guidelines which not only define the health-enhancing dose of PA, but also recommend

121

how PA promotion works for the specific target groups of adults with NCDs [18]. The

122

majority of countries fail to provide such recommendations on PA promotion for adults

123

with NCDs within a specific national scenario. Therefore, health professionals entrusted

124

in PA promotion often lack recommendations for the best strategies and interventions to

125

raise low PA levels in adults with NCDs.

126
127

With such limitations in mind, Germany developed its own national recommendations in

128

2016 [19]. The Committee for the Development of the German Recommendations on

129

Physical Activity and Physical Activity Promotion consisted of an interdisciplinary

130

working group made up of 16 scientists from six German universities. From an

131

international perspective, the German recommendations are characterised by two unique

132

features – namely, the formulation of specific recommendations for adults with NCDs

133

and the systematic integration of guidelines for PA and PA promotion for adults with

134

NCDs as well as for the other target groups (children and adolescents, adults, and older

135

adults).

136
137

Following on from this, the purpose of this paper is to describe the methodology we

138

used to develop the German National Recommendations for Physical Activity and

139

Physical Activity Promotion in Adults with NCDs and summarise the main results of

140

this development. By doing this, the paper hopes to help other nations develop their own

141

PA guidelines for the increasingly relevant target group of adults with NCDs. The paper

142

also hopes to promote debate in relation to the implications of addressing specific target

143

groups and the impact of this specific targeting on PA levels and public health policies.

For the development of the German PA recommendations for all target groups (children

For adults with NCDs, the three-phase process was initially applied to PA

154

recommendations that were specific to the seven NCDs. Considering years of life lost

155

due to premature death as well as years lived with disability, six of these NCDs are

156

among the most burdensome diseases in Germany for both men and women [20]. The

157

six NCDs are clinically stable ischemic heart disease, chronic non-specific back pain,

158

clinical depression, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

159

(COPD), and stroke (> 6 months after the acute event). Additionally, osteoarthritis was

160

added as seventh disease. Along with chronic non-specific back pain, osteoarthrosis

161

accounts for the majority of diseases in the disease group of musculoskeletal diseases

162

which is among the three most relevant disease groups regarding burden of disease [20].

163

Osteoarthritis is characterised by high prevalence and high levels of stress among those

164

affected. Its negative effects include pain, functional restrictions in everyday life, and

165

loss of quality of life [21]. Finally, generic PA recommendations for adults with NCDs

166

were

167

recommendations. We previously published a comprehensive description of the entire

methodology [22, 23]. The central aspects of the methodological approach are described

Phase 1: Systematic literature review and establishment of quality criteria

172

Separate literature searches were carried out for the seven NCDs (1A). The searches

173

were comprised of PA recommendations, reviews of PA recommendations, and meta-

174

analyses of the effects of PA, all published between 2010 and 2015 on the Medline

175

database, either in German or English. Primary studies were not included.

176
177

As a first step in the selection of papers, titles and abstracts were checked for relevance.

178

At this point, primary studies, non-human articles, papers not available in German or

179

English, and papers that dealt with a different topic were excluded. Those papers

180

deemed relevant were then analysed in their entirety. The full texts were subjected to a

181

detailed relevance test that was conducted based on a standardised assessment sheet.

183

After checking the papers for the correct target population (adults with one of the seven

184

relevant NCDs), all papers containing original PA recommendations for those adults

185

were included. If a paper did not contain any original PA recommendations but

186

contained a meta-analysis of the effects of PA for the relevant target group or a review

187

of clinical guidelines or PA recommendations, then it was included.

188
189

For the standardised quality evaluation of the researched PA recommendations, an

190

evaluation instrument was developed (1B). The evaluation instrument was used to

191

ensure that methodically high-quality PA recommendations were selected. First, a list of

192

23 potential quality criteria was compiled based on the methodology of the German

193

Instrument for Methodological Guideline Appraisal [24] and the instrument for

194

Advancing guideline development, reporting and evaluation in health care (AGREE)

195

methodology [25]. Second, the list of quality criteria was submitted to national experts

196

for validation, based on the methodological approach of the Delphi surveys [26]. The

197

experts were asked to check the proposed quality criteria for completeness and

198

comprehensibility and to add any missing criteria (Delphi procedure stage 1). Finally,

199

the revised list of quality criteria was submitted to the experts once again to evaluate its

200

relevance with regard to the identification of high-quality PA recommendations (Delphi

201

procedure stage 2).

202
203

Phase 2: Evaluation, selection, and content analysis of identified physical activity

204

recommendations

205

The yielded PA recommendations were evaluated based on their content and

206

methodological quality using the evaluation instrument developed in phase 1 (2A). The

207

domains that were evaluated were the scope and purpose of the recommendations, the

208

methodological accuracy in their development, their clarity and differentiation of

209

content, and their structure (see Additional file 1).

210
211

The quality evaluation formed the basis for the selection of what is here referred to as

212

the source recommendations (2B). The source recommendations are those used as the

213

basis for the German PA recommendations. The cut-off value for the selection of high-

214

quality recommendations was > 60% in the domains of scope and purpose and

215

methodological accuracy in the development of the recommendations. Additionally,

216

reviews of recommendations and meta-analyses for the target group of adults with

217

NCDs were included as supplementary resources. We did this without explicit quality

218

ratings because even reviews with low quality could include statement on high quality

219

PA recommendations and meta-analysis normally include a quality rating leading to the

220

inclusion of studies with a high methodological quality. The identified source

221

recommendations were then subjected to a detailed content analysis using a standardised

222

analysis sheet that contained all 28 quality criteria (2C).

223
224

Phase 3: Synthesis of content analysis and derivation of the recommendations for

225

health-effective physical activity

226

Based on the detailed content analysis of the source recommendations and

227

supplementary texts, seven disease-specific recommendations for health-relevant PA

228

were compiled. These recommendations were then critically reviewed in relation to the

229

reported health effects, dose-response relationships, and risk–benefit considerations of

230

PA. Finally, the identification of cross-disease commonalities across the seven diseases

231

(e.g., similar amounts of PA or similar types of PA recommended) was discussed

232

resulting in the derivation of generic PA recommendations for adults with NCD.

Physical activity promotion recommendations

235

A systematic review of reviews regarding the efficacy/effectiveness of interventions for

236

PA promotion in adults with NCDs was conducted. This review comprises one of the

237

main pillars that led to the development of the German PA promotion recommendations

238

for adults with NCDs.1 The methodology used for the systematic review of reviews is

239

briefly described below. A more detailed characterisation has already been explicated

[29, 30].

242

Systematic review of review papers that examined the efficacy/effectiveness of

243

interventions for physical activity promotion

244

A systematic review of review papers that examined the efficacy and effectiveness of

245

interventions was conducted. Six electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus,

246

PsycINFO, ERIC, and IBSS) were systematically searched for the terms ‘physical

247

activity,’ ‘intervention,’ ‘evidence,’ ‘effect,’ ‘health,’ and ‘review.’ Alternative terms

248

were also utilised for PA, including ‘bike,’ ‘biking,’ ‘cycling,’ ‘walking,’ ‘active

249

transport,’ ‘human-powered transport,’ ‘sedentary,’ ‘exercise,’ and ‘sport.’ Two

250

independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance based on the following

251

criteria: a) the paper contains empirical results from single studies; b) the paper includes

252

interventions focused on PA promotion or the reduction of physical inactivity; c) the

253

paper focuses on the efficacy of interventions; and d) the paper is written in English or

254

German. For the identified relevant papers, a secondary screening process of the entire

two reviews were carried out to analyse the cost-effectiveness of PA
promotion interventions and develop generic quality criteria for the conception,
implementation, and evaluation of interventions for the promotion of PA. The results of
these reviews have been published [27, 28] and are beyond the scope of this article.

255

text was conducted by two independent reviewers based on the same criteria. Finally,

256

additional papers were identified via screening the reference lists of identified articles.

257
258

An independent researcher assessed the quality of the identified papers using two

259

separate tools – namely, the AGREE instrument (The AGREE Collaboration 2003),

260

which was used in the formulation of the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines [31],

261

and our own quality criteria, which allowed for higher levels of differentiation regarding

262

the methodological quality criteria of each review (see Additional file 2). Based on both

263

instruments, percentage values were calculated for each paper. Such values indicated the

264

percentages of fulfilled criteria for each paper, both on the basis of the AGREE tool and

265

our newly developed instrument. These percentage values were calculated based on the

266

number of applicable criteria (e.g. some criteria were only applicable for meta-analyses).

267

The combined results defined the quality of each paper as high, medium, or low. A

268

paper was classified as being of high quality when at least 75% of the AGREE criteria

269

and 60% of our own criteria were fulfilled. Papers were defined as being of medium

270

quality if they satisfied just one of these thresholds, while low-quality papers reached

271

neither threshold.

272
273

Expert consensus

274

A group of scientific experts developed the German Recommendations for Physical

275

Activity Promotion in a process of consensus. Two individuals with expertise in PA

276

promotion were assigned the task of assessing the efficacy/effectiveness of the identified

277

papers. Following the methodology proposed by Smith et al. [32], both reviewers

278

applied a standardised process of analysis that consisted of six steps. First, an

279

independent review of the identified literature was conducted, and a draft summary

12

280

statement was compiled. Second, a meeting of both reviewers was held to discuss

281

statements and agree on a conjointly revised summary statement. Third, the summary

282

statement was presented and discussed with the reviewers who were assigned to other

283

target groups (e.g. older adults). Fourth, a workshop meeting was held to present each

284

summary statement to the entire project group (including scientists involved in drafting

285

the PA promotion recommendations as well as an International Scientific Advisory

286

Board). Each summary statement was revised on the basis of expert feedback. Fifth, the

287

recommendations for each target group were drafted using the finalised summary

288

statements. A template specifying how to draft the recommendations was developed and

289

provided by the project leaders. Sixth, the drafted recommendations were circulated for

290

review by the entire project group as well as the International Scientific Advisory Board.

291

Recommendations were made when both reviewers rated the available evidence as being

292

of strong or medium quality, based on the following criteria: (1) the number of available

293

reviews focusing on a given intervention type is sufficient to formulate

294

recommendations; and (2) the reviews show conclusive evidence for efficacy.

295

Recommendations were not made when the above criteria were not fulfilled (i.e. when

296

the available evidence was weak or inconclusive).

For all seven analysed NCDs, PA and/or exercise is recommended as an effective

309

treatment option. The positive benefits of PA outweigh its costs and side effects. A

310

physically inactive lifestyle is associated with significantly greater health risks than a

311

lifestyle with high levels of PA. Details regarding the health effects, risks, and side

312

effects of PA within the individual disease-specific PA recommendations are reported by

such as type 2 diabetes, COPD, arthritis in the hip or knee, clinically stable ischemic

318

heart disease, stroke (> 6 months after the acute event), clinical depression, or chronic

319

non-specific back pain.

320
321

In order to achieve significant health effects (e.g., improved symptoms, enhanced

322

physical functioning, improved psychological health and quality of life), adults with

323

NCDs should be physically active on a regular basis. However, health-enhancing results

324

can also occur when individuals who were entirely physically inactive become

325

somewhat more active. Every step away from physical inactivity is important, as each

326

step leads to increased health benefits.

327
328

The PA recommendations for adults with NCDs are presented in Table 2. They do not

329

differ from the PA recommendations for healthy adults and represent the minimum

Efficacy/effectiveness for physical activity promotion

362

The PA promotion recommendations for adults with NCDs were developed based on 18

363

systematic reviews. The detailed quality ratings of the papers are included in Additional

364

file 4. All the papers conducted their reviews in healthcare settings. Two analysed

365

general PA promotion interventions [33, 34], seven focused on indication-based PA

366

promotion [35–41], three assessed interventions in primary care [42–44], and six dealt

367

with the effects of different types of PA-promoting interventions [45–50].

369

The reviews analysing general interventions for PA promotion found that the effects of

370

interventions are stronger when PA behaviour is targeted specifically rather than in

371

combination with other health behaviours [33]. Furthermore, interventions are most

372

effective when they are theory-based and use techniques of behavioural change [34].

373
374

Six indication-based PA-promotion approaches provided medium-level evidence during

375

the assembling of the recommendations. Short et al. [35] evidenced that special

376

behaviour-based techniques can be useful for adults with breast cancer. Interventions for

377

adults with rheumatoid arthritis were investigated in two reviews [36, 37], and one

378

review indicated that PA promotion for this target group can be effective in the long

379

term [37]. The research findings identified only one study that showed positive effects of

380

a PA-promoting intervention for people with cystic fibrosis [38]. One review analysed

381

home-based exercise programmes for adults with chronic low back pain, and most of the

382

studies reviewed showed significant effects [39]. For adults after stroke, specific

383

behavioural interventions, such as targeted counselling or specially tailored exercise

384

programmes, are more effective than exercise programmes and general counselling [40].

385

The usual rehabilitation measures comprising PA therapy combined with psychosocial

386

or educational interventions can increase PA behaviour in the short term for individuals

387

with cardiovascular disease [41].

388
389

Concerning interventions in primary care and/or curative care, one review shows that

390

exercise referral schemes can lead to small positive effects in the short and medium term

391

[42]. Orrow et al. [44] conducted a review and meta-analysis based on a broad range of

392

interventions and showed that interventions in primary care can be effective. Another

393

review concluded that motivational interventions are effective for PA promotion [43].

394

The last group of reviews focused on the effectiveness of different types of

395

interventions. Based on these reviews, there is strong evidence for the effectiveness of

396

pedometer-based interventions for adults with musculoskeletal diseases [45],

397

inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based interventions in cardiac

398

rehabilitation [46, 47], and conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of web-based

399

interventions for patients with NCDs [50]. Furthermore, the reviews showed evidence of

400

the effectiveness of the counseling method motivational interviewing for individuals

401

with NCDs [48] and of lifestyle interventions delivered by nurses in primary healthcare

402

[49].

All papers in the systematic review refer to health care settings, e.g. general practitioners

NCDs were made for interventions in healthcare institutions (see Table 3).

412

DISCUSSION

413

The German guidelines for PA and PA promotion for adults with NCDs provide

414

recommendations for the amount of PA necessary to yield substantial health benefits and

415

strategies for PA promotion so that the recommended level of PA is successfully

416

reached. Thus far, and to the best of our knowledge, such a combination of

417

recommendations is the first of its kind. The concomitant implementation of both PA

418

and PA promotion recommendations produces considerable health gains in what is, to

419

date, one of the largest and most inactive adult subgroups.

420
421

The German recommendations for PA and PA promotion represent a fundamental

422

building block in terms of mobilising national efforts to fight against physical inactivity.

423

On the one hand, professional organisations in the fields of medicine, exercise therapy,

424

and/or rehabilitation can use these guidelines to promote increased PA levels among

425

individuals with NCDs. On the other hand, health professions and societies ought to

426

support the dissemination and implementation of these guidelines in order to maximise

427

their influence and ensure that the target population is reached.

428
429

The ideal dosage of PA for various target groups has been long discussed. Evidence

430

supporting the claim that PA promotes health among people with NCDs is plentiful [15].

431

When considering a wide scope of health outcomes, many adults with NCDs respond to

432

higher levels of PA by producing better health effects, and the understanding that ‘a lot

433

helps a lot’ still rings true. Nonetheless, there are other outcomes in this regard. For

434

example, a higher level of PA intensity might have negative effects on psychological

435

well-being [51]. For some outcomes, much of the maximal effect is achieved from a

436

relatively low dose of PA; for example, the greatest reduction in mortality rates occurs at

437

PA levels already well below the recommended minimum dose of 150 minutes/week

19

438

[52]. The German PA recommendations for adults with NCDs are based on a synthesis

439

of the available recommendations. Consequently, they also use the concept of the

440

minimum dose for substantial health gains. Nevertheless, it is a task for future

441

researchers to question the concept of minimum doses and determine the dose–response

442

relationships for certain health outcomes (e.g., mortality, morbidity, physical

443

functioning, psychological health and well-being).

444
445

The current German PA recommendations for individuals with NCDs are identical to

446

those suggested for healthy adults (i.e. 150 minutes of moderate PA plus two strength-

447

training sessions per week). This generic outcome was synthesised based on seven

448

carefully prepared, high-quality, indication-specific recommendations. The claim that

449

this dose leads to substantial health gains in most individuals with NCDs is evidence-

450

based. Notwithstanding, this dose might be physically and psychologically excessive for

451

some individuals with NCDs – this point cannot be ignored. The importance of patient-

452

centred tailoring plans and programmes that focus on adjusting the dosage to individual

453

needs and functionality levels is therefore emphasised. This supports and values adults

454

with NCDs being regularly active, according to their current health status and their

455

ability.

456

In addition to PA behaviour, other health-related behaviours, including smoking,

457

alcohol, diet, and medication, have a major influence on the health of individuals with

458

NCDs [53]. It is understood and anticipated that the recommendation to change only one

459

behaviour at a time might not be practical to implement in a real-world setting. For

460

example, in a typical rehabilitation context, it is often recommended to try and adjust

461

multiple behaviours at once. Even if this is medically recommended and meaningful, the

462

probability of successful behaviour change decreases as a result. Influencing multiple

463

behaviour patterns individually might be a better approach. Addressing the promotion of

464

PA first might be the best option, as regular PA can act as a catalyst to promote changes

465

in other health behaviours [54].

466
467

The basic premise of the Committee for the German Recommendations for Physical

468

Activity and Physical Activity Promotion was to develop recommendations for specific

469

target groups. Independent and separate working processes were implemented for

470

children and adolescents, adults, older adults, and adults with NCDs. Thus, the German

471

recommendations include more diverse population subgroups and fulfil a requirement of

472

the Advisory Committee of the United States [55]. Due to the rather low level of

473

evidence of PA promotion in individuals with NCDs, the recommendations for adults

474

with NCDs are less detailed compared to the other target groups [29]. Nevertheless,

475

additional to the development of the target-specific recommendations for PA promotion,

476

general quality criteria for the conceptualization, implementation, and evaluation of

477

interventions for PA promotion were developed [27]. For example, during the

478

conceptualisation phase, quality criteria, such as the multidimensionality of the

479

intervention, the involvement of different stakeholders, and the specification of goals

480

and target behaviour, need to be considered. Other criteria relate to, for example,

481

communication, sustainability, and resources during implementation as well as to

482

different aspects of the evaluation (see Additional file 5 for a list of all quality criteria).

483

Even though there is no specific evidence in relation to adults with NCDs for most of

484

these criteria, the criteria support the conceptualisation, implementation, and evaluation

485

of interventions for adults with NCDs.

486
487

It is important to highlight that nations should not only develop PA and PA promotion

488

recommendations. In order to maximise the reach of the recommendations, it is crucial

489

to attempt to disseminate said recommendations to the appropriate individuals,

490

communities, and organisations at the right time. In order to facilitate understanding of

491

the developmental process for PA recommendations, it has been proposed that the

492

German context should be analysed through the lens of the multiple streams approach

493

(MSA) [18]. In summary, the MSA was developed in 1984 to study policy processes and

494

to clarify why certain issues receive or attract attention and others do not (agenda

495

setting). It posits that the political process comprises three streams that flow

496

independently – namely, the problem stream (i.e. specific issues perceived as

497

problematic and in need of solution), the policy stream (i.e. the development of

498

strategies and possible policies to address the stated problem), and the politics stream

499

(i.e. operating actors such as political parties, institutions, and interest groups). The

500

interaction between the three streams might facilitate or hinder the effective

501

dissemination and adoption of national PA and PA promotion guidelines. As for the

502

German context, including PA promotion as a stand-alone topic in the political agenda

503

might have come as a result of said interaction. This propelled several different

504

strategies and actions that boosted the impact of PA and PA promotion

505

recommendations nationwide. A more detailed description and dissection of the

506

aforementioned strategies and actions was published by Rütten et al. [18].

507
508

Limitations

509

The methodological approach used to develop both guidelines is not without its

510

restrictions. A goal of the Committee for the Development of German Guidelines for

511

Physical Activity was to address the target group of adults with NCDs. However, only a

512

(very) limited amount of finances, time, and human resources was made available for the

513

overall development of the guidelines.

514
22

515

Due to said limitations, the committee opted to apply an overall methodological

516

approach based on the extraction and synthesis of high-quality reviews, meta-analyses,

517

and existing recommendations. Original scientific works, for instance, could

518

unfortunately not be taken into account during this development. The consideration of

519

these works would have allowed for additional and relevant topics to be explored in

520

more detail. As an example of this consequence, the current PA guidelines do not

521

incorporate the role of sedentary behaviour and its impact on adults with NCDs.

522
523

As for the PA promotion guidelines, general recommendations can be provided for

524

interventions in terms of their theoretical foundations. However, investigating the most

525

effective theory-based intervention or conducting comparative analyses of the effects of

526

different theories was beyond the scope of our methodological approach.

527
528

The underlying evidence comes exclusively from interventions carried out in the

529

healthcare system. Studies carried out in other settings (e.g., educational system, work

530

place) are lacking. It is likely that the consideration of original scientific papers would

531

have identified further studies conducted in other settings. It is likely that this would

532

have led to more multi-faceted recommendations for the promotion of PA in adults with

533

NCDs.

534
535

The robustness of the selected methodology as well as its economic limitations represent

536

a compromise that aims to include individuals with different NCDs, as they represent a

537

crucial target group from a public health perspective. When compared to Canada, for

538

example, Germany used a low-cost approach, which resulted in numerous

539

methodological limitations. Such an approach, however, seems to be feasible for other

540

nations, as it helps to curtail restraints imposed by a scarcity of available resources.

542

CONCLUSION

543

The development of PA recommendations for adults with NCDs provides an evidence-

544

based target dose of PA that adults with different NCDs can use to achieve significant

545

health outcomes; the development of PA promotion recommendations for adults with

546

NCDs helps to achieve that dose. Thus, the development of evidence-based PA and PA

547

promotion guidelines is an important building block in relation to the initiation and

548

implementation of actions for PA-related health promotion in Germany. The formulation

549

of specific PA recommendations for adults with NCDs and their combination with

550

specific PA promotion recommendations renders the German recommendations quite

551

unique. The German Recommendations for PA and PA promotion for adults with NCDs

552

help other nations develop their own PA guidelines for the increasingly relevant target

553

group of adults with NCDs.
