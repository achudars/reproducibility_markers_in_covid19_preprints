Abstract

27

Purpose: Infants and toddlers with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are at high

28

risk for adrenal crisis and associated sequelae. To better understand acute illness at this early age,

29

we determined the frequency and severity of acute illness and hospitalizations between 0-4 years

30

of age, both within CAH and compared to controls. We also evaluated the impact of pre-hospital

31

stress-dose hydrocortisone on Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.

32

Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 40 CAH youth and 27 age-matched controls at

33

a tertiary center. Characteristics of acute illnesses during the first 4 years of life were recorded,

34

including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, ED visits, hospitalizations, abnormal electrolytes, and stress-

35

dose hydrocortisone usage.

36

Results: CAH youth had more frequent illnesses requiring stress-dosing when they were

37

younger than 2 years old [4.0 (1.0-6.0)] compared to when they were 2-4 years old [3.0 (1.0-4.0),

38

P < 0.05], with the most illnesses during their first year of life. As well, CAH infants and

39

toddlers had more hospitalizations younger than 2 years old compared to 2-4 years old (36 vs 2).

40

25% (3/12) of CAH youth with abnormal electrolytes in the ED did not receive any stress-dosing

41

(oral/IM) prior to the ED, and only 25% (3/12) had received intramuscular hydrocortisone at

42

home. CAH youth had more frequent ED visits (7.4 times as many) and hospitalizations (38 to 0)

43

compared to controls.

44

Conclusions: Very young children with classical CAH are at high risk for acute illness and

45

hospitalizations during their first 2 years of life, and do not receive adequate stress-dosing prior

46

to the ED despite appropriate education. Our findings underscore the need for earlier recognition

47

of acute illness in this vulnerable population and improved education regarding administration of

48

stress-dose hydrocortisone to prevent morbidity.

Introduction

50

Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a

51

potentially life-threatening form of primary adrenal insufficiency that affects ~1:15,000 children,

52

and is characterized by stress hormone (cortisol and epinephrine) and aldosterone deficiencies,

53

along with androgen excess (1,2,3).

54

Infants and toddlers with CAH merit special attention, with increased all-cause mortality

55

between ages 1 to 4 years, and a high risk for hypoglycemia, seizures, hospitalization, permanent

56

cognitive impairment, and death caused by adrenal crisis during acute infectious illness (4,5,6,7).

57

Newborns diagnosed with salt-wasting CAH require rapid replacement of cortisol, aldosterone,

58

and salt to avoid catastrophic dehydration (6). In addition, newborns and infants with CAH

59

exhibit epinephrine deficiency (2), adding risk for illness, adrenal crisis, and Emergency

60

Department (ED) visits (8) at an age that inherently has an increased frequency of ED visits (9).

61

Age has been noted to be an important factor in the longitudinal study of illness in CAH patients,

62

with more illness events and stress-dosing noted to occur during childhood, and young age acting

63

as a robust predictor of stress-dosing during this period of life (8). However, more needs to be

64

understood about acute illness events and their pre-hospital treatment in infants and toddlers with

65

classical CAH.

66

The main objective of this study was to characterize the frequency and severity of acute

67

illnesses and hospitalizations in children with classical CAH during their infant and toddler

68

years. We evaluated age, frequency of stress-dose illnesses and associated symptoms (e.g., fever

69

≥ 100.4oF, vomiting, and/or diarrhea), pre-hospital management of acute illness including stress-

70

dose hydrocortisone, and severity of clinical presentation in the ED during the first 4 years of

71

life. We hypothesized that the frequency and severity of illness would negatively correlate with

72

age in CAH. We also compared CAH youth with age-matched controls, and hypothesized that

73

there would be more frequent illness, ED visits, and hospital admissions in the CAH group

74

compared to controls.

Study Participants and Methods

76

This study was a retrospective chart review approved by the Children’s Hospital Los

77

Angeles Institutional Review Board. Parents gave their written informed consent.

78

Study Participants

79

Forty children with classical CAH were studied from 1 month to 4 years of age (Table 1).

80

CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency was diagnosed biochemically based on a positive

81

newborn screening test (California Department of Health Services, starting in 2005), and/or an

82

elevated

83

(testosterone and androstenedione) measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass

84

spectrometry LC-MS/MS (Esoterix, Calabasas Hills until 2009; Quest Nichols Diagnostics, San

85

Juan Capistrano after 2009). Thirty-five percent of subjects underwent genetic CYP21A2

86

analysis. There were 33 youth with the salt-wasting (SW) form and 7 with the simple-virilizing

87

(SV) form; of the total, 65% (25/40) were female. Doses of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid,

88

and sodium chloride were recorded for the children with CAH at both clinic and ED visits. CAH

89

youth were on higher hydrocortisone (HC) and fludrocortisone doses during their first 3-6

90

months of life compared to when they were older, and so we excluded 0-6 month-old dose data

91

from analyses of medication doses. Infants (with the exception of 3 SV) were treated with NaCl

doses of 11.5 (9.7-15.8) mEq/day largely in the first year of life.

96

otherwise healthy and euthyroid on replacement levothyroxine. The control group had a similar

97

frequency of laboratory testing and follow-up visits as the CAH group.

98

Data from medical records were collected, spanning 20 years, including information that

99

was recorded by a physician at clinic and ED visits at our institution. The number of acute

100

illnesses, along with specific symptoms accompanying each illness (i.e., fever > 100.4o F,

101

vomiting, and diarrhea), were assessed. Hospital treatment per illness-event was assessed from

102

ED and inpatient admission records. In children with CAH, pre-hospital care was also assessed

103

per illness-event, including HC stress doses administered during illness (stress-dose illness) and

104

the route of administration [oral (PO) or intramuscular (IM) injection], as reported by caregivers.

105

Pre-hospital transport was assessed, including administration of IM HC by Emergency Medical

106

Services (EMS) personnel. ED serum electrolyte and glucose results were recorded, with

107

electrolyte derangements deemed as a combination of one or more of the following:

108

hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate). Hypoglycemia was

109

defined as glucose < 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Interventions performed in the ED, such as

110

administration of parenteral HC stress doses or intravenous fluids, were recorded from ED

111

records.

112

Statistical Analyses

113

SPSS software version 24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses.

114

Data were categorized into age groups of < 2 and ≥ 2 years old to evaluate modifying effects of

115

age on illness frequency, and were normalized by person-year. Wilcoxon-Signed Rank tests were

116

used for these comparisons. Chi-square tests and Spearman correlations were used for

117

comparison of acute illness characteristics within the CAH group. Chi-square tests (for

118

association) and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparisons between CAH and control

119

youth. All statistical assumptions were investigated before assessment and addressed when

120

necessary. The criterion for significance was α = 0.05 in all analyses, while the Benjamini-

121

Hochberg procedure was used to control for false discovery rates. Results are shown as

frequencies and percentages, or median and interquartile range (IQR).

Results

124

Illness Characteristics in CAH Youth

125

CAH youth had more frequent stress-dose illnesses when they were younger than 2 years

126

old [4.0 (1.0-6.0)] compared to when they were 2-4 years old, per person-year [3.0 (1.0-4.0), Z =

127

-2.37, P < 0.05; Figure 1]. In addition, CAH youth had more frequent stress-dose illnesses during

128

their first year of life [3.0 (1.0-4.0)] compared to their second year of life [1.0 (0-2.0), Z = -3.03,

129

P < 0.01].

130

CAH youth also had more frequent stress-dose illnesses involving vomiting when

131

younger than 2 years old [1.0 (0-2.0)] compared to when they were 2-4 years old [0 (0-1.0), Z = -

132

2.20, P < 0.05; Figure 1]. However, there were no significant differences in frequency of stress-

133

dose illnesses involving fever or diarrhea when the two age groups were compared.

134

Pre-Hospital Maintenance Medications and Stress-Dosing

135

Maintenance medication doses were assessed over the first 4 years of life, excluding the

136

first 6 months of life when doses could typically be higher. CAH youth exhibited a higher

137

maintenance HC dose prior to 2 years old [15.1 (12.8-17.5) mg/m2/day] compared to 2-4 years

138

old [13.5 (10.4-15.7) mg/m2/day; Z = -3.48, P < 0.001]. There was no difference in

139

fludrocortisone dose prior to 2 years old and 2-4 years old.

140

Fludrocortisone dose correlated positively with frequency of overall stress-dose illness in

141

CAH youth prior to 2 years old (R = 0.33, P < 0.05), and with illnesses involving vomiting (R =

142

0.38, P < 0.05) in particular. During this same age period, HC doses correlated with illnesses

143

involving diarrhea (R = 0.38, P < 0.05). When older (2-4 years old), HC doses also correlated

144

with total number of febrile illnesses in CAH youth (R = 0.36, P < 0.05), and trended towards

145

significance with abnormal electrolytes (R = 0.29, P = 0.07). There were no significant

146

correlations between HC or sodium chloride doses and frequency of stress-dose illness or with

147

illnesses involving vomiting.

148

Stress-Dosing and ED Visits

149

CAH youth had more frequent ED visits per person-year prior to 2 years old [1.5 (0.8-

150

3.5)] than when they were 2-4 years old, per person-year [0 (0-1.0), Z = -4.17, P < 0.001; Figure

151

2]. Illnesses requiring a pre-hospital HC stress dose, either PO and/or IM, directly correlated

152

with the number of ED visits (R = 0.75, P < 0.01). The highest newborn 17OHP level (i.e.,

153

newborn screen or initial pre-treatment confirmatory serum level; Table 1) was positively

154

associated with frequency of ED visits in CAH youth between the ages of 2-4 years (R = 0.33, P

155

< 0.05), but not when they were younger than 2 years old.

156

Of 149 ED visits, there were 101 visits where CAH youth were given stress-dose HC (80

157

parenteral and 21 PO) in the ED. In regard to the former, 78.8% (63/80) of parenteral stress

158

doses were administered in those who were younger than 2 years old and only 21.3% (17/80)

159

were preceded by a PO stress dose given at home. Only 21.3% (17/80) of parenteral stress doses

160

were administered when youth were between the ages of 2-4 years old.

161

Ten CAH youth received an IM HC injection at home and a subsequent intravenous (IV)

162

HC stress dose in the ED. Two youth received an IM HC injection at home, but did not receive a

163

parenteral stress dose when they were in the ED. Three youth received an IM HC injection at

164

home, but were not brought to the ED afterwards.

165

ED Visits, Abnormal Electrolytes and Hypoglycemia, and Hospitalizations

166

Electrolytes were checked in 74 of 149 ED encounters in CAH youth, with 29.7% (22/74)

167

being abnormal. There were five times the abnormal electrolyte events in CAH infants and

168

toddlers during their first 2 years of life (10 events) compared to when they were 2-4 years old

169

(two events). Eight events occurred during infancy, and two events between 1-2 years of age. All

170

22 encounters of abnormal electrolytes in these age groups resulted in parenteral HC stress-

171

dosing in the ED, of which 3 patients were subsequently admitted.

172

Only 25% (3/12) of infants and toddlers with abnormal electrolytes had received IM HC

173

prior to the ED, with two of the three injections given in youth older than 2 years old. Half (6/12)

174

of the cases had received a PO stress dose prior to the ED, but no IM HC, and 25% (3/12) had

175

not received any stress-dosing (PO or IM) prior to the ED.

176

In addition, there were four events of hypoglycemia in infants and toddlers with CAH.

177

Three of these events occurred during the first 2 years and one event occurred in a patient who

178

was 2-4 years old. All four patients were PO stress-dosed prior to their hypoglycemic event and

179

received parenteral HC at the ED. However, none of the patients had received IM HC prior to the

180

ED.

181

Overall, when CAH youth were younger than 2 years old, they had 18 times as many

182

hospitalizations compared to when they were 2-4 years old (36 vs 2). All 12 patients with

183

abnormal electrolytes in the ED were hospitalized. Four ED encounters involving normal

184

electrolytes also resulted in hospitalizations. One of these patients had received both PO and IM

185

HC stress doses at home, followed by an additional IV HC stress dose in the ED. CAH youth did

186

not have any hospitalizations requiring pediatric intensive care, nor were there any deaths.

CAH vs Controls: Illness Characteristics

188

CAH youth between the ages of 0-4 years old had significantly more frequent total

189

illnesses compared to controls [CAH 6.0 (3.2-9.0) vs controls 1.0 (0-4.0); Z = -5.19; P < 0.001],

190

per person-year. As well, CAH youth had more frequent illnesses involving fever [CAH 2.6 (1.1-

191

4.0) vs controls 0.5 (0-1.0); Z = -4.85; P < 0.001], vomiting [CAH 1.0 (0.8-2.8) vs controls 0 (0-

192

0.5); Z = -4.70; P < 0.001], and diarrhea [CAH 1.0 (0-2.0) vs controls 0 (0-1.0); Z = -3.03; P <

193

0.01].

194

CAH vs Controls: ED Visits and Hospitalizations

195

CAH youth between the ages of 0-4 years old had 7.4 times as many ED visits (149 visits

196

in 36 cases) compared to controls (20 visits in 10 cases), with an overall increased median

197

frequency of ED visits compared to controls [CAH 2.0 (1.0-4.8) vs controls 0 (0-1.0), Z = -4.30,

198

P < 0.001]. CAH youth had a total of 38 hospitalizations, with 36 occurring during their first 2

199

years of life and only two between the ages of 2-4 years old. The control infants and toddlers did

200

not have any hospitalizations.

201

Discussion

202

This study demonstrates that infants and toddlers with classical CAH have a significant

203

increase in frequency and severity of stress-dose illnesses during their first 2 years of life than

204

when older. CAH youth have more illnesses associated with vomiting, ED visits, and

205

hospitalizations when they are younger than 2 years old, compared to when they are 2-4 years

206

old, carrying significance for an age group known to have a high risk for morbidity and mortality

207

from adrenal crises (6,10). The adrenal stress-hormone deficiencies inherent to CAH (including

208

epinephrine deficiency in infancy) likely add to this heightened risk of decompensation with

209

acute illness generally seen in infants and toddlers (2,4,11). An even higher frequency of stress

210

dose-requiring illness in the CAH youth that we studied occurred during their first year of life,

211

further highlighting the risks at younger age in this condition.

212

We also found that infants and toddlers with CAH have more frequent ED visits and

213

hospitalizations than age-matched controls, along with higher rates of illness and symptoms of

214

fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Morbidity associated with dehydration, hypoglycemia, and

215

subsequent adrenal crisis is particularly concerning in very young children (12,13,14,15), leading

216

us to consider the CAH infants and toddlers with abnormal electrolytes in the ED. The frequency

217

of abnormal electrolytes and hypoglycemia was significantly higher when children were younger

218

than 2 years old compared to between 2-4 years. This could also explain the correlation between

219

fludrocortisone dose and stress-dose illness, with patients on higher daily fludrocortisone doses

220

likely to have more severe salt-wasting during illness than patients on lower fludrocortisone

221

doses. Our finding supports prior reports of fludrocortisone dose as a predictive marker for

222

stress-dose requirement (8) and as a risk factor for hospitalizations in CAH (10).

223

The timely pre-hospital administration of stress-dose HC during acute illness seems

224

critical to the prevention of an adrenal crisis and its associated morbidity and mortality (16).

225

However, we found that only 25% (3/12) of CAH infants and toddlers with abnormal electrolytes

226

in the ED had appropriately received a stress-dose injection of HC at home. In fact, 25% of the

227

total cohort had not received any stress-dosing in the pre-hospital setting prior to the ED. It can

228

be challenging for parents to administer IM HC despite having significant knowledge (17),

229

perhaps due to technical difficulty with the kit or injection, lack of supplies, and/or psychological

230

stress in a high-acuity situation involving a young child. Education in a multidisciplinary clinic

231

could improve rates of IM HC administration during acute illness (18), although we still found

232

reluctance to administer IM HC by parents at our center who were taught stress-dosing at

233

diagnosis and had routine review at clinic visits by a clinician or nurse. We found that two

234

emergently ill toddlers (extreme lethargy in one and a seizure in the other) also did not receive an

235

injection from first responders, reflecting the lack of education regarding the emergency

236

hydrocortisone injection in the state of California. This suggests that standardizing the EMS

237

management of patients with adrenal insufficiency to include IM HC could minimize metabolic

238

derangements and prevent major morbidity related to adrenal crises in very young children with

239

CAH (19,20,21).

240

Despite most of our findings pointing towards an improvement in frequency and severity

241

of illness in CAH youth with age, we did note a correlation between the frequency of ED visits

242

and initial newborn 17OHP level when CAH youth were older toddlers (2-4 years old). Higher

243

daily hydrocortisone dose also correlated with more febrile illnesses at this age. This suggests

244

that CAH disease severity could continue to impact illness-related morbidity in older toddlers,

245

despite the expectation that frequency and severity of illness would improve at this age. Only

246

one-third of the sample had genetic testing, thus limiting analyses involving CYP21A2 gene

247

mutations, but additional markers of CAH severity would be useful to study further.

248

Our study was limited by the retrospective nature of data collection, in terms of available

249

detail on illness-related measures such as the trajectory of symptoms, barriers to administration

250

of critical pre-hospital stress dosing, and time to hospital intervention. The number of acute

251

illness episodes may have been under-reported in controls, as illness history is not as critical a

252

component of medical history for a child who does not have adrenal insufficiency. Thus, a

253

prospective controlled study would help to better elucidate the connection between treatment

254

during illness and clinical outcome, and a larger sample size would also allow for more in-depth

255

analyses per year of life.

256

Our study highlights the heightened risk for acute illness, adrenal crisis, and related

257

morbidity that exists in youth with classical CAH when they are younger than 4 years old, and

258

even more so when they are under 2 years of age. Caregivers are rarely providing IM stress-

259

dosing with HC at home in young children with CAH, especially in those cases found to have

260

metabolic derangements in the ED, highlighting the need for better training of family caregivers

261

and EMS personnel, to improve outcomes in children with classical CAH.
