Abstract
We undertook a genome-wide association study of susceptibility to invasive group A
streptococcal (GAS) disease combining data from distinct clinical manifestations and
ancestral populations. Amongst other signals, we identified a susceptibility locus
located 18kb from PAX5, an essential B-cell gene, which conferred a nearly two-fold
increased risk of disease (rs1176842, odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence intervals 1.52.3, P=3.2x10-7). While further studies are needed, this locus could plausibly explain
some inter-individual differences in antibody-mediated immunity to GAS, perhaps
providing insight into the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin in streptococcal toxic
shock.
Main
Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease is defined by the isolation of
Streptococcus pyogenes from a normally sterile site. While various manifestations can
occur, infections of the skin and soft tissues are most frequent. Relative to other
infections, invasive GAS is associated with a high case fatality rate[1], with an
estimated 163,000 deaths attributable to the condition each year worldwide.[2]
Over time the majority of the population experience some degree of exposure to GAS
yet invasive infections are rare.[3] Moreover, while the majority of invasive infection
occur at the extremes of age, it remains unclear why a minority of otherwise healthy
children and young adults develop devastating invasive infections.[4] While several
pathogen and environmental factors are implicated, a role for host genetic variation is
certainly plausible given the heritability of other GAS diseases, including rheumatic
fever[5] and recurrent pharyngitis.[6] Indeed, host genetic variation in the human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus has previously been linked to susceptibility to invasive
GAS disease,[7,8] perhaps reflecting preferential binding of certain alleles to GAS
superantigens.[8-10] Additionally, a number of reports have now emerged linking host
genetic variation elsewhere in the genome to susceptibility to invasive bacterial
disease more broadly.[11-13] Accordingly, we undertook a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) of susceptibility to invasive GAS disease, combining the results of four
case-control studies covering distinct clinical manifestations and ancestral
populations.
This study used genotyping data from several projects, brought together to form four
case-control analyses (Suppl. Figure 1). Ethical approval was granted to each project
by the relevant institutional authorities.
In the first, cases were children and adults of European ancestry with GAS-associated
necrotising fasciitis (NF) (n=34) or other manifestations of invasive GAS (n= 9) treated
at hospitals across the UK. We have previously investigated the relationship between
the variants in HLA locus and risk of invasive GAS disease amongst these individuals
finding the DQA1*01:03 associated with susceptibility.[14] Individuals aged 65 years
or more or with co-morbidity were excluded. The youngest patient was 18 months of
age and oldest was aged 63 years (median 35 years). In the second analysis, cases
were children of European ancestry with GAS empyema thoracis (n=36) recruited from
hospitals across the UK. The youngest patient was aged four months and the oldest
17 years (median 4 years). None had comorbidities or established immunodeficiency.

Both sets of cases were genotyped using the HumanCore platform (Illumina Inc., USA)
or the Global Screening Array (Illumina) specifically for this analysis. Controls for both
analyses were healthy adolescents of European ancestry recruited to vaccine studies
based in Oxfordshire (n=1540) and had previously been genome-wide genotyped
using the HumanOmniExpressExome platform (Illumina).
In the third analysis, cases were children of East African ancestry with GAS
bacteraemia (n=66) recruited at a single rural hospital in Kilifi, Kenya, as part of a
broader study of childhood bacteraemia in this setting. [15] The youngest patient was
aged one day and the oldest nine years (median 162 days). Controls for this analysis
were children recruited to a birth cohort set in the area surrounding that hospital
(n=1689). Both cases and controls had been genotyped previously by the Wellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium 2 using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform (Affymetrix,
USA).[12,13]
In the fourth analysis, cases were children and adults without comorbidity of Oceanian
ancestry with various invasive GAS phenotypes, including bacteraemia without source
(n=7), soft tissue infection (n=3) and meningitis (n=2), treated at hospitals in New
Caledonia (NC), a French territory in the South Pacific. The youngest patient was aged
two months and the oldest patient 24 years (median three years). Controls for this
analysis were healthy adult volunteers reporting Oceanian ancestry recruited in NC to
a previously reported study of rheumatic heart disease (n=193).[16] Both cases and
controls were genotyped using the HumanCore platform (Illumina).
Quality control was undertaken using standard approaches[17] but with an additional
step to minimise confounding due to the use of multiple genotyping platforms (Suppl.
Figure 1 & 2).[18] Crucially, after these steps, the resulting case-control datasets were
well matched for genetic ancestry (Suppl. Fig. 3). Next, we randomly selected ten
controls for each case carrying forward 161 cases and 1610 controls for analysis,
equating to an effective sample size of 585 individuals. We then performed genotype
imputation, run separately for the UK, Kenyan and NC datasets, before running casecontrol association analyses in each dataset using linear mixed models implemented
in GCTA software[19] (v1.26.0) with no evidence of residual confounding based on
the distribution of test statistics (Suppl. Figure 4). We then performed genome-wide
meta-analysis using Metasoft software[20] (v2.0.1) for 4,234,532 variants present at
minor allele frequency greater than 5% in all four datasets. Further analyses including
estimation of effect sizes by transformation[21] were performed in R (v3.0). Finally, in
the absence of a further dataset in which to confirm or refute our findings, we designed
a three-step process to identify the most robust association signals that would be
suitable for further investigation (Suppl. Fig. 5). This involved an initial screening
genome-wide meta-analysis under the standard fixed-effects model followed by
further analysis of putatively associated loci using the more stringent random-effects
model to assess heterogeneity. Taking forward genomic regions containing at least
one variant at suggestive significance in the random-effects meta-analysis (P<10-5),
we performed a sensitivity analysis in which we reran the random selection of controls
100 times over before repeating the individual case-control analyses and rerunning
the fixed-effects meta-analysis, prioritising those loci at which the association with
susceptibility showed the greatest consistency.

In our initial genome-wide screen, we identified one genomic region that contained a
variant associated with susceptibility at genome-wide significance (PFE<5x10-8) and
24 genomic regions that contained at least one variant associated at suggestive
significance (PFE<10-5) (Suppl. Table 1; Suppl. Figure 5a). Thirteen of these regions
also contained at least one variant at suggestive significance in the random-effects
meta-analysis (Suppl. Table 2; Suppl. Figure 5b). In our sensitivity analysis, we found
only five regions (nine variants) had no PFE values greater than 1x10-4 while only two
regions (five variants), which we took forward for further analysis, had no PFE values
greater than 5x10-5 (Suppl. Table 3).
The first of two regions shortlisted in the sensitivity analysis (maximum PFE<5x10-5)
was on chromosome 7 in an intron of the MAGI2 gene. The lead variant (rs35089407,
PFE=5.3x10-8) was well supported by surrounding variants (Figure 1a). The effect was
strongest in the NC analysis where the minor allele (thymidine) was associated with a
three-fold increased risk of disease declining to a 1.5-fold increase in the UK invasive
disease analysis (combined odds ratio, OR, 2.25, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.68–
3.02; Figure 1b). The overall minor allele frequency was 14.7% (range 7.5-21.9%)
while the imputation accuracy was high (information metric, 0.96–0.97).
The second region was on chromosome 9 located 18kb from the PAX5 gene in the
intron of a non-coding long RNA (termed AL450267.2). The peak compromised four
neighbouring variants (PFE=3.2x10-7–7.3x10-7; Figure 1c) of which one was at
suggestive significance in the random-effects analysis (rs1176844, PRE=7.6x10-6). The
minor allele of rs1176844 (thymidine) was associated with an almost two-fold
increased risk of the disease in the combined analysis (combined OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4–
2.4; Figure 1d). Notably this variant, which had a minor allele frequency of 43.3%, had
been directly genotyped in both the UK and NC datasets while the imputation accuracy
in the Kenyan dataset was very high (information metric, 0.997).
We next investigated overlap between the five shortlisted variants in these two loci
and known or predicted regulatory elements (Suppl. Table 3) using the RegulomeDB
tool.[22] Overall evidence of regulatory function was minimal with nothing to suggest
altered transcription factor binding or gene expression. However, rs1327501 within the
PAX5 signal overlapped histone modifications consistent with enhancer elements
found specifically in analyses of primary hematopoietic stem cells and primary B cells
from cord blood but no other cell types. Additionally, the other three PAX5 variants
overlapped an area of weak transcriptional activity in primary hematopoietic stem cells
in short term culture but no other cell types (Suppl. Figure 6).
Finally, we reviewed the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus in light of our earlier
report of an association between the DQA1*01:03 allele and susceptibility in the UK
invasive disease component of our dataset. [14] While we did not perform HLA
imputation for this analysis, it is noteworthy that the two missense variants that define
the DQA1*01:03 allele (i.e. rs36219699 and rs41547417) were excluded from this
analysis because their minor allele frequency was less than 5% in the Kenyan dataset.
However, neither were associated with susceptibility in the UK empyema or NC
analyses (P=0.50–0.65). Despite this, the strongest signal in the HLA locus mapped
to within 1kb of HLA-DQA1 (rs17612669, OR 1.5, 95% 1.1–2.1, PFE=0.005). While this
signal is difficult to interpret in the context of a GWAS, it is noteworthy that it showed
negligible heterogeneity despite the diverse genetic ancestry of the study population.

DISCUSSION
This preliminary investigation of susceptibility to invasive GAS disease provides the
first evidence that common host genetic variants may influence the risk of this infection
across a range of populations, age groups and sub-phenotypes.
The signal located 18kb from PAX5 is of particular interest because this gene is widely
considered a key regulator of B cell maturation and fundamental to the genetic
processes that lead to antibody production.[23] This is relevant because deficient
antibody-mediated immunity to key GAS virulence factors has long been proposed as
a key determinant of invasive GAS susceptibility in the general population. [24,25]
Indeed, antibody-mediated neutralisation of virulence factors including superantigens
may drive the protective effects of intravenous immunoglobulin, which, when
administered in streptococcal toxic syndrome, was recently shown to be associated
with a two-fold reduction in mortality at 30 days.[26] Moreover, the overlap with
putative regulatory elements in haemopoietic stem cells, while far from definitive in the
absence of experimental validation, raises the possibility these variants somehow
impact differentiation of haemopoietic stem cells into B cell precursors, which might
have downstream effects on antibody-mediated immunity.
In contrast, the MAGI2 signal is harder to relate to invasive GAS disease. MAGI2 plays
a fundamental role in maintenance of synapses, endocytosis and postendocytic
trafficking. [27] The gene is large, stretching 1.4Mb, and it is of interest that the locus
has previously been to linked to infantile spasms. [28] Additionally, the gene has been
linked by GWAS to traits including blood lipid and bone metabolism phenotypes[29]
but overall it remains unclear how this locus could influence susceptibility to invasive
GAS disease.
This study has a number of limitations, not least of which is the small sample size
relative to most modern genetic association studies. Consequently, our analysis has
limited power to detect all but the strongest signals while our estimates of effect size
are imprecise and should be interpreted with caution. While follow-up of these
preliminary findings is a vital next step, it is important to emphasise that invasive GAS
is a rare disease and sporadic which renders recruitment challenging. Indeed, despite
our focus on children and young adults, this report is, to our knowledge, the largest
study of genetic susceptibility to invasive GAS to date.
Moreover, we deliberately set out to identify variants influencing susceptibility to GAS
across a range of clinical manifestations and ancestral populations, as a consequence
of which our study largely ignores the heterogeneous nature of this disease. Indeed,
such heterogeneity might explain our findings in the HLA locus since it is possible the
DQA1*01:03 allele effects predisposition to only a subset of clinical phenotypes or is
dependent on the presence of specific bacterial factors such superantigens.[14]
Future larger-scale prospective studies with access to more precise clinical data
coupled with information about the pathogen should help clarify this issue.
Nonetheless, our use of data from three distinct ancestral populations has substantial
advantages, not least of which is improved detection of underlying causal variants.[30]

Overall, this is the first time a GWAS of susceptibility to invasive GAS has been
undertaken. While the small sample size necessitates caution, these results suggest
common genetic variation in the PAX5 locus, as well as potentially elsewhere in the
genome, impacts susceptibility to invasive GAS disease. While follow-up of our
findings in independent datasets is warranted, this analysis underscores the potential
of investigating genetic susceptibility to GAS disease to bring about an improved
understanding of pathogenesis.

Figure 1. Association of the MAGI2 and PAX5 loci with invasive GAS disease.
(a) Regional association for the MAGI2 locus with (b) a forest plot for rs35089407,
the lead variant. (c) Regional association plot for the PAX5 locus with (d) a forest
plot for rs1176844. In the regional association plots, genomic position is plotted
against the negative common logarithm of the p-value from the fixed-effects metaanalysis for all variants within 250kb of the variant most associated with
susceptibility. Variants are coloured by linkage disequilibrium with the most
associated variant averaged across the entire data set (estimated r2: dark blue, 0–
0.2; light blue, 0.2–0.4; green, 0.4–0.6; yellow, 0.6–0.8; red, 0.8–1.0). In the forest
plots, the effect size estimates for the lead variant at each locus is shown under an
additive genetic model with association statistics from each analysis combined by
fixed-effects meta-analysis.
