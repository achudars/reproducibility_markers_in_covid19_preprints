ABSTRACT
Background and Objectives: Post mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a chronic pain
condition that develops after breast cancer surgery. The objective of this study was to determine
if Pecs II block administered prior to general anesthesia (GA) reduced the incidence of PMPS
after mastectomy and axillary clearance (MAC) when compared with conventional analgesic
therapy.
Methods: This cross sectional study compared incidence and severity of PMPS in 288 women
who underwent unilateral MAC. Questionnaire survey was done via personal and telephone
interview with 145 patients who received conventional analgesic therapy versus 143 patients
who received Pecs II block. Outcomes assessed included incidence, severity and chronic pain
symptom and sign score of PMPS.
Results: We found a significantly lower incidence of PMPS in patients who received Pecs II
block compared with conventional analgesic therapy [49.7% vs. 63.4%, OR 0.57 (0.36-0.91), P
= 0.018], which was a 22% relative risk reduction (RR 0.78). Severity of PMPS in Pecs II group
was also significantly reduced as shown by lower static and dynamic pain scores at operative site
(P < 0.001). Furthermore, Pecs II group reported significantly lower Chronic Pain Symptom and
Sign Score (P = 0.002) compared to conventional group.
Conclusions: Pecs II block prior to MAC significantly reduced the incidence of PMPS, severity
of chronic pain at operative site and number of chronic pain symptoms and signs related to
PMPS.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and second most common cancer in
the world comprising 25% of all newly diagnosed cancers in 2012.1 Breast cancer accounted for
32.1% of all cancer among females in Malaysia.2 It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
among women. Surgery is still the mainstay of treatment despite therapeutic advances in
management of breast malignancy over the last decade.3
Persistent pain following mastectomy was first reported in 1978.4 It is a distinctive,
persistent and debilitating neuropathic pain syndrome and has been named post mastectomy pain
syndrome (PMPS).5 It is a difficult clinical condition to treat, may have profound negative
impact on health-related quality of life, and produce considerable disability and psychological
distress.6 The incidence of PMPS is reported to range between 11% and 60%.7-10
The exact etiology of PMPS is not clear but studies have found positive correlations
between the intensity of acute postsurgical pain and the development of chronic pain post breast
cancer surgeries.11-13 Over the years, several regional anesthesia techniques such as thoracic
epidural, paravertebral block, intercostal nerve block and intra-pleural block was being utilized
in breast surgeries to optimize acute post-operative pain.14
The advancement of ultrasound (US) technology in the field of regional anesthesia has
led to the introduction of a lesser invasive block, pectoral nerves block (Pecs block, later known
as Pecs I block) by Blanco in 2011.15 It is a superficial inter-fascial block involving placement of
local anesthetic (LA) between pectoralis major and minor muscles in order to anesthetize the
lateral and medial pectoral nerves. A modified Pecs block (Pecs II block) was introduced by the
same author a year later.16 Additional LA injection into the inter-fascial plane between the

pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles anesthetizes the anterolateral chest wall by
blocking the intercostobrachial, third to sixth intercostal and long thoracic nerves. Due to its
wider coverage, Pecs II block has gained popularity and is now the block technique of choice in
breast surgeries.17,18
To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies on the effectiveness of Pecs
II block in reducing the incidence and/or severity of PMPS. By conducting a questionnaire
survey on patients who had undergone mastectomy and axillary clearance (MAC) in our
institution, we hoped to be able to shed some light on the relationship between Pecs II block and
PMPS.

METHODS
This cross sectional study was approved by the research and ethics committees in both
institutional and national levels. This project was registered under National Medical Research
Register (NMRR), Ministry of Health Malaysia.
Patients who underwent MAC from July 2015 – June 2017 in Hospital Kuala Lumpur
(HKL) were recruited. In order to standardize surgical technique and reduce confounding factors,
case selection was only limited to unilateral MAC. Other breast cancer surgeries, such as wide
local excision, modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and lumpectomy, were excluded. Patients
with the following characteristics and problems were excluded from our study – past history of
chronic pain and on regular analgesics, chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery, surgical
complications (such as infection or wound breakdown) or cancer recurrence, history of
psychiatric illness, inability to be contacted, inability or unwillingness to participate in the study.
There is currently no standard definition for this chronic pain syndrome. Depending on
the definitions applied, patient selection and methods used, the incidence varies. The definition
of PMPS used in this study was modified from International Association for the Study of Pain19
(IASP) and other studies.9,20 In our study, PMPS is taken as chronic post surgical pain in the
anterior aspect of the thorax, axilla, and/or upper half of the arm beginning after mastectomy,
without objective evidence of local abnormality, persisting either continuously or intermittently
for more than three months after surgery, and may be associated with allodynia or sensory loss.
Questionnaire used in this study was obtained with permission from Dr Manoj Kumar
Karmakar, the author of a previous study on the effect of thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) on
chronic pain post mastectomy.21 It was prepared in both English and Malay versions (Appendix

1) to cater for our local population. The English version was translated to Malay using forward
and retrograde translation methods to check the reliability and precision of the words by four
independent translators who were bicultural Malay speakers with a good command of English.
The translation was further evaluated by a panel of experts in the field of Regional Anesthesia
and Pain Management to verify the idiomatic and cross-cultural equivalence to the English
version. Seven respondents were then recruited to assess face validity of the questionnaire.
Repeat evaluation was done until respondents understood all the questions in the process of
content validation. No modification was needed as the first draft of questionnaire was well
understood by all respondents. Internal consistency reliability and construct validation was done
using Cronbach’s alpha, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett’s test of sphericity.22 The
KMO value of 0.56 and the significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity (P< 0.001) in this validation
was acceptable. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.736, indicating good internal consistency.
Personal details, medical history and contact number of all patients who underwent MAC
within the specified period were collected from patient`s medical records with the permission
from the Head of Breast and Endocrine Unit, Department of General Surgery, HKL. Each patient
who fulfilled the selection criteria was assigned a study number and grouped into either
conventional analgesic therapy (Group A) or Pecs II block (Group B).
All patients included in this study had undergone MAC under GA with regular method of
induction and maintenance inhalational anesthesia. Those who received Pecs II block had the
procedure done before induction of anesthesia by a team of experienced regional
anesthesiologists. Both groups received appropriate doses of opioid and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) for intraoperative analgesia. Post operatively, all patients received
standardized oral analgesics for pain control.

The survey was conducted by a single investigator. Recruited patients were seen in the
surgical outpatient clinic to obtain consent and complete the questionnaire. Patients who were
not seen in the clinic were contacted by telephone to obtain verbal consent and answer the
questionnaire according to the template prepared (Appendix 2). A series of questions related to
chronic pain of PMPS were asked as per questionnaire.
PMPS was deemed to be present in patients who reported pain at rest over the operated
site, axilla, or arm (i.e., reported yes to any of the 3 questions 4, 6, and 8 in Appendix 1) related
to surgery. Pain scores were recorded according to numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0 = no
pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain. Pain scores of 1-3, 4-6 and 7-10 were graded as mild,
moderate and severe pain respectively as per WHO Pain Ladder.23 Also in order to quantify and
statistically compare the total number of chronic pain symptoms and signs reported by the
patients, a score of 1 was given to a response “yes,” and a score of 0 was given to a response
“no” to the questions listed in Appendix 3.21 Maximum possible score was 12. Patients suffering
from PMPS were offered further assessment and management at our Pain Clinic.

Statistical Analysis
Using Krejcie and Morgan formula,24 sample size was calculated based on the incidence of
PMPS, which was our primary outcome variable. Published data showed that the incidence of
PMPS ranges from 11% to 60%.7-10 With expected incidence of 60%, using 2 proportions sample
test, we calculated that a minimum of 95 patients per study group would provide 80% power (α =
0.05).
Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 software. Continuous variables are presented
as mean ± standard deviations or median (interquartile range) where appropriate. Categorical
data is shown as numbers and percentages. Comparison of continuous data between groups was
performed by Student’s 𝑡 test. The Chi square test was used to compare groups with categorical
variables. A P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The odds ratio (OR) and
relative risk or risk ratio (RR), its standard error and 95% confidence interval (CI) were
calculated according to Altman.25

A total of 163 patients (92 from Group A and 71 from Group B) reported postoperative
pain consistent with the definition of PMPS applied in this study, giving an overall incidence of
56.6% (Figure 2). There was a significantly lower incidence of PMPS in Group B compared to
Group A (P = 0.018). Odds ratio for PMPS in Group B was 0.57 (CI 0.35-0.91) while relative
risk was 0.78 (CI 0.64-0.96).

The mean chronic pain score on a scale of 0 to 10 was relatively low in both groups
(Table 2). In terms of severity of PMPS, lower static and dynamic pain scores at operative site
(P < 0.001) was noted in Group B. There was no significant difference found in pain severity at
ipsilateral axilla and arm. No patient from both groups reported severe pain at operative site,
ipsilateral axilla or arm.

DISCUSSION
The overall incidence of PMPS of 56.6% in our study is similar to those reported in
recent studies.7-10 Our study showed that incidence and severity of PMPS are significantly lower
in patients who received Pecs II block for MAC. Odds ratio value of 0.57 (OR<1) indicates that
the odds of developing PMPS in Pecs II group is 43% less likely than conventional analgesic
therapy group with the true population effect between 64% and 9%. In other words, conventional
group is 1.76 times more likely to develop PMPS. This result is statistically significant as the
95% CI (0.36-0.91) does not include the value of 1. However, since the upper limit CI of 0.91 is
near to the value of 1, the practical significance of this finding is questionable. Also, OR can
substantially underestimate (if OR<1) the magnitude of risk.26
Hence, we calculated the relative risk or risk ratio (RR). The RR value of 0.78 with 95%
CI of less than 1 (0.64 – 0.96) once again proves that there is statistically significant evidence
that Pecs II group is at lower risk of developing PMPS. The relative risk reduction (RRR) of 22%
in developing PMPS is seen in Pecs II group compared to conventional analgesic therapy group.
And again, since the upper limit CI of 0.96 narrowly misses the value of 1, the clinical
significance of this finding is questionable.
Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a form of chronic post surgical pain (CPSP)
after breast cancer surgery that is characterized by pain and sensory disturbances consistent with
a neuropathic origin.7,8 There is no accepted laboratory or radiographic criteria used to diagnose
PMPS; it is a diagnosis of exclusion. The exact pathophysiology of PMPS is uncertain. It could
be due to nerve damage, particularly the intercostobrachial nerve, as a result of excessive
mechanical forces (severance, compression, ischemia, stretching or retraction) during operative

procedures.9 The development of PMPS may also be related to molecular events that cause
sensitization of peripheral nerves as well as spinal and supra-spinal processing centers.27
Duration and severity of acute postoperative pain is an important predictor of the
development of CPSP10 and several studies showed association between acute postsurgical pain
and development of chronic pain post breast surgeries.11-13 Hence, an effective acute pain
management with peripheral nerve block (PNB) prior to surgery plays a significant role in
reducing the risk of peripheral and central sensitization, and thereby mitigating development of
PMPS.27,28 This was reflected in our study, in which the incidence and severity of PMPS was
significantly lower in patients who received Pecs II block prior to surgery.
Over the past decade, multiple studies have been done to evaluate the role of PNB for
preemptive as well as preventive analgesic therapy to improve acute post-operative pain and
CPSP. Recent meta-analysis by Hussain et al29 and Terkawi et al30 provided moderate quality
evidence suggesting that thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) may potentially reduce the
incidence of CPSP after breast surgery. However, TPVB is technically more challenging and
poses higher risk of complications such as pneumothorax, spinal cord trauma, sympathetic block,
and hypotension.31
Ultrasound-guided Pecs II block has gained popularity in breast cancer surgeries due to
its relative simplicity, safety and efficacy.17 Studies by Wahba and Kamal32 as well as Kulhari et
al33 reported significantly prolonged duration of postoperative analgesia with less requirement of
rescue analgesia after breast cancer surgery in patients receiving a Pecs II block compared with a
thoracic paravertebral block during the first 24 hours postoperative period. Recent systematic
review and meta-analysis by Versyck et al17 and Singh et al18 also showed Pecs II block
significantly alleviate acute postoperative pain and reduced opioid consumption intraoperatively

as well as 24 hours post surgery. This opioid sparing effect is crucial in prevention of PMPS as
opioid induced hyperalgesia is a risk factor for development of chronic post surgical pain.28 Thus
Pecs II block has been recommended as first line option for regional analgesia in breast surgery.
However, investigation into effectiveness of Pecs II block in these studies was only confined to
the acute postoperative period, and none of the above studies addressed the issue of CPSP or
PMPS.
There were a few limitations in our study. One limitation was the possibility of recall bias
on pain memory among our respondents. Unfortunately, studies on this subject have been
inconclusive. Salovey et al34 investigated the accuracy on reporting chronic pain episodes during
health surveys and concluded that retrospective self-reports of pain collected systematically with
measures of proven reliability seemed relatively trustworthy. However, in a later publication,
Miranda et al35 concluded that prior musculoskeletal symptoms were poorly remembered after
some years, and the recall was strongly influenced by current symptoms. Since the patients in
our study underwent MAC not more than 2 years ago, we hope that recall bias was not a
significant problem. Secondly, data on intra- and postoperative pain management were not
collected in our study. These data could be relevant, given that ineffective pain control during the
acute period could impact upon subsequent development of CPSP.
Another limitation was the use of postoperative adjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy in
some patients. It is possible that such adjuvant therapy given in the perioperative period may lead
to the development of PMPS by inducing local subclinical necrosis, neuritis, and
myositis/fibrosis.5,9,11 In our study, only patients who received adjuvant therapy preoperatively,
but not those in the postoperative period, were excluded. Though postoperative chemo- and/or

17

radiotherapy did not significantly affect the incidence and severity of PMPS in our study, this
finding is limited due to the variation in adjuvant therapy received based on disease condition.

Conclusion
Pecs II block prior to MAC significantly reduced the incidence of PMPS, severity of
chronic pain at operative site and number of chronic pain symptoms and signs related to PMPS.

TELEPHONE INTERVIEW TEMPLATE

Introduction:
Hello Ms. / Mrs. _____________. Good morning/afternoon/evening.
I am Dr Vimal Varma from Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, Hospital Kuala
Lumpur. I’m currently conducting a survey related to the anesthetic service you received for
your breast surgery done on [dd/mm/yyyy] in HKL.

Purpose:
This phone call is to find out how you are after the breast surgery. In particular, we would like to
know whether you have problem with persistent pain over the area you are operated on, your
armpit or your arm. This condition is called post mastectomy pain syndrome or PMPS. I will be
asking you a few questions and the whole survey will take about 10 minutes.

Additional information for patients who have received Pecs II block:
You may remember that when you had an anesthetic for the surgery, you have received an
injection called pectoral nerve block for pain relief. The purpose of this survey is to determine
whether that injection has any effect in reducing the occurrence of PMPS.

Reassurance:
Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. The information collected from you will
remain strictly confidential. You do not have to give reasons if you prefer not to take part, and
your decision will not affect your future treatment. When you participate in this study, you do
not have to pay anything; similarly, no payment will be given to you.

As I have mentioned, this survey will take about 10 minutes, and your participation is greatly
appreciated. If you are not free at the moment, we can reschedule this call when you are
convenient to talk.

Do I have your kind permission to begin the survey?

Questionnaire:
Questions 1-17

End the call with :
These are all of the questions I have for you. Thank you so much for your time.
You will receive a written consent form and a patient information sheet (PIS) by mail in near
future. Kindly retain the PIS, sign the consent form and mail the signed consent form in an
enclosed stamped envelope to us.
If you have questions about this survey, you can contact me at this number 0123070598 for more
information.

Thank you again and have a nice day.

** Remarks:
If the patient suffers from PMPS, she will be offered further assessment and management at our
Pain Clinic.
