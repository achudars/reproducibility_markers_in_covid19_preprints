Abstract
Introduction
Distinguishing between two of the most common causes of dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD) and
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), on clinical diagnostic criteria alone has poor diagnostic accuracy.
Promising tools to increase the diagnostic accuracy of AD are the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
biomarkers and electroencephalography (EEG), which is being investigated as a diagnostic tool for
neurodegenerative brain disorders. In this study, we investigated the utility of EEG-based biomarkers in
comparison and in addition to established neurochemical biomarkers in the AD versus FTLD differential
diagnosis.
Methods
Our study cohort comprised 37 AD and 32 FTLD patients, of which 19 AD and 11 FTLD had definite
diagnoses. All these participants had CSF biomarker analyses resulting in four neurochemical (NCM)
biomarkers (Aβ1-42, T-tau, P-tau181 and Nf-L) and underwent 19-channel resting-state EEG. From the EEG
spectra, dominant frequency peaks (DFP) were extracted in four regions resulting in four dominant
frequencies (in left-temporal, frontal, right-temporal and parieto-occipital regions). This yielded a total of
eight features (4 NCM + 4 EEG), which we used to train and test a classifier and assess the diagnostic value
of the markers separately (using only the NCM or EEG subset) and combined.
Results
The classification accuracies were much higher when training and testing on the definite subgroup than on
the whole group. Furthermore, we found that the NCM feature subset allowed a better accuracy than the
EEG feature subset, both when training and testing on the whole group (NCM 82% vs EEG 72%), as on the
definite group only (92% vs 86%). Using both feature subsets together increased the accuracy to 86% in the
whole group and 94% in the definite subgroups. Another interesting finding was the presence of two
spectral peaks in a considerable number of patients in both groups.
Conclusion
Combining EEG with neurochemical biomarkers resulted in differential diagnostic accuracies of 86% in
clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients and of 94% in patients having a definite diagnosis. Furthermore,
we found evidence that the slowing down of the dominant EEG rhythm might be a gradual appearance of a
slow rhythm and fading out of the normal ground rhythm, rather than a gradual slowing down of the
ground rhythm. Finally, we have discovered two differences in the occurrence of the dominant EEG
frequency: people lacking a clear dominant peak almost all had definite AD, while people with two peaks
more often had FTLD. These unexpected but interesting findings need to be explored further.

1. Introduction
Distinguishing between two of the most common causes of dementia – namely Alzheimer disease (AD) and
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) – on clinical diagnostic criteria alone has poor diagnostic
accuracy, with high numbers of autopsy-confirmed cases contradicting the clinical diagnosis (Elahi and
Miller, 2017; Engelborghs et al., 2008), mainly due to overlap in clinical presentation, especially in the early
disease stages.
A promising tool to increase the diagnostic accuracy of AD is the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers
(Niemantsverdriet et al., 2017). During the past decades, a lot of progress has been made to improve AD
diagnosis, resulting in biomarker-based research diagnostic criteria, also for its prodromal stage of mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Therefore, revised criteria of both the National Institute on
Aging/Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) and the International Working Group (IWG) include AD CSF
biomarkers in the clinical diagnostic work-up (Albert et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014; McKhann et al., 2011).
Analysis of the core AD CSF biomarkers (β-amyloid peptide composed of 42 amino acids (Aβ1-42), the Aβ1-42
/Aβ1-40 ratio, total tau protein (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (P-tau181)) can help to
differentiate between AD and non-AD dementias like FTLD, but they cannot be used to confirm a non-AD
dementia (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2017). Moreover, pathological values of these core AD CSF biomarkers
can be seen in non-AD dementias, which might lead to possible misinterpretation of the biomarker results
in absence of clinical information. Indeed, both Aβ1-42 and T-tau can be detected at intermediate levels (in
between normal control and abnormal AD values) in non-AD patients, also in FTLD. CSF P-tau181 is a more
specific marker for AD and is of help for AD versus non-AD dementia differential diagnosis (Struyfs et al.,
2015). However, in order to improve the discriminatory power for the differential diagnosis of dementia,
additional markers, more specific to the non-AD dementia are valuable. As CSF levels of neurofilament light
chain (Nf-L) were significantly higher in FTLD compared to AD and controls, there is an added value for Nf-L
in the differential diagnosis of FTLD (Goossens et al., 2018).
Electroencephalography (EEG) is an easily accessible, non-invasive, inexpensive technique, and is already
being investigated as an adjunctive investigation in dementia (Ferreira et al., 2016). We have previously
shown that EEG maxpeak frequency is an easy and useful measure with an added value in the
differentiation between AD and FTLD, reaching a diagnostic accuracy of 78.4% (Goossens et al., 2017).
In this study, we investigated the utility of EEG-based biomarkers in comparison and in addition to
established neurochemical biomarkers in the AD versus FTLD differential diagnosis.

2. Methods
2.1 Study participants
The study cohort comprised 37 subjects with probable (n=18) or definite (n=19) dementia due to AD, and
32 probable (n=21) or definite (n=11) FTLD patients (Table 1). Patients were selected from the Memory
Clinic of Hospital Network Antwerp (Engelborghs et al., 2006, 2003). To ensure a high certainty level of
dementia subtypes for patients without definite diagnosis, only patients with extensive clinical follow-up
were included. All patients underwent (among others) neuropsychological testing including Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE), and had core AD CSF biomarker analyses (Aβ1-42 , T-tau, P-tau181) in
cerebrospinal fluid (Somers et al., 2016). Clinical diagnosis of probable AD was based on NIA-AA (McKhann
et al., 2011) and IWG-2 criteria (Dubois et al., 2014) and included these biomarkers. Diagnosis of probable
FTLD was based on criteria described by Neary (Neary et al., 1998). Subgroups of definite dementia patients
were defined by genetic carrier status and/or post-mortem confirmation of brain pathology (Mackenzie et
al., 2011; MacKenzie et al., 2010; Montine et al., 2012). This study was approved by the ethics committee of
University of Antwerp (Antwerp, Belgium).

2.2 Neurochemical (NCM) biomarkers
Lumbar puncture, and CSF and blood sampling and handling was performed according to a standardized
protocol (del Campo et al., 2012; Engelborghs et al., 2017). All CSF and blood samples were stored at the
IBB Biobank in polypropylene vials at 80°C until analysis.
CSF biomarker levels were quantified using commercially available single-analyte ELISA kits (one kit lot
each), strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions (INNOTEST β-Amyloid(1-42), INNOTEST hTau-Ag
and INNOTEST Phospho-Tau(181P) from Fujirebio Europe, Belgium; and Nf-L from UmanDiagnostics. All
samples were run in duplicate, blinded for diagnosis. Intra-assay coefficient of variation was below 10% for
all analytes.

2.3 Electroencephalographic (EEG) markers
EEG recordings
EEG data were recorded using OSG digital equipment (BrainLab/BrainRT) with the international 10–20
system used for electrode placement. ECG was recorded in a separate channel. Recordings were exported
in EEGLab format (Delorme and Makeig, 2004) for offline analysis and each file contained continuous data
in 19 channels. During recording, subjects were seated upright and were asked to alternate between eyes
closed and eyes open to stay awake. EEG data was processed manually using BrainRT. Artefact-free EEG
during the eyes-closed condition was flagged. This flag consisted of start latency of the useable part and its
duration, both in milliseconds. No epileptiform activity was observed in any of the EEG recordings. The
EEGs were re-referenced to average.

Epoch extraction
In our previous study on this dataset (Goossens et al., 2017), we extracted two-second epochs. This proved
to be too coarse to detect smaller frequency differences. Therefore, we doubled the epoch length to foursecond epochs from each EEG and selected six epochs (the minimum over all patients) equally spread over
all available epochs of that patient. This epoch length ensured retaining most of the artefact-free signal,
while also allowing a spectral resolution of 0.25 Hz. We did not increase the epoch length further, as this
started to increase loss of artefact-free EEG. With longer epochs, chances increase that certain continuous
parts of clean EEG are not long enough to contain a number of epochs that accounts for the same total
time.

Transformation to frequency spectrum
We used Welch’s power spectral density estimate (Welch, 1967). In Matlab (MATLAB, 2019), this method is
implemented with integrated support for windowing and based on the built-in fft (Fast Fourier Transform).
Instead of computing the spectrum on each epoch separately, we concatenated the epochs back into a
‘continuous’ signal. We aligned the windowing exactly with the epoch boundaries, by using a Hamming
window with a length equal to the epoch length and the overlap between windows equal to zero. This
resulted in a smooth, average spectrum with much smaller roll-off than a rectangular window.
To increase the resolution, we padded the epochs with zeroes, by setting the nfft parameter of Matlab’s
built-in pwelch function to a multiple of the epoch length, thus increasing the resolution by the same
factor. Padding makes the resolution higher, but does not add any more information. The extra points in
the spectrum are estimated by sinc interpolation between the original points. For our purpose – detecting
peaks in the spectra – this was perfectly adequate.

Dominant frequency peak extraction
Dominant frequency peaks (DFPs) were detected within the interval [5-15] Hz in every channel. A peak was
defined as a point of which both neighbouring points have lower amplitudes. In case multiple peaks were
detected, only the peak with the highest amplitude was retained, and this in each channel.
To reduce redundancy, balance the number of neurochemical and EEG features and deal with the fact that
some channels did not always exhibit peaks, we summarised the peaks found over all channels into four
regions. To do this, we fine-tuned the algorithm from our previous study (Goossens et al., 2017) to detect
the DFP with the highest amplitude over the channels within a specific region, as defined in table 2. This
procedure was also helpful in avoiding missing data, as only one channel per region needed to show a
clearly distinguishable peak. The resulting dataset contained the frequency of every region’s DFP, for each
subject.

2.4 Classification
Feature sets
We used three feature sets: one subset containing the four NCM markers, one subset containing the four
EEG markers and one set of eight features containing both the NCM and EEG markers. Each of these sets

was used for training and testing the classifier algorithm, such that we could compare the performance of
the subsets and verify if combining them improves the accuracy.

Cross-validation
Training and testing were done using cross-validation. Features (NCM and/or EEG markers) were collected
into one dataset, which was then randomly divided into ten subsets or folds with the same proportion of
the two groups (AD and FTLD) as in the complete dataset. We applied tenfold cross-validation: nine folds
were used for training the classifier, while the remaining fold was used to test the trained classifier. This
step was repeated until each fold had been used exactly once for testing. The test results for each fold were
then combined into a total estimate of the classifier’s performance.
We repeated tenfold cross-validation 100 times, which allowed for the calculation of the mean and
standard deviation of the classifier’s performance indices: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and percentage correctly classified (PCC, also called accuracy). The
sensitivity and specificity respectively show the ratio of correct positives over actual positives and correct
negatives over actual negatives. The positive and negative predictive values respectively show the ratio of
correct positives over all instances classified as positive and negatives over all instances classified as
negative.

Classifier algorithm: Random Forest
A Random Forest is a collection of randomly generated decision trees. For each of these individual trees, a
subset of features is selected at random from the complete feature set and then the tree is built. This
resolves a major problem of decision trees: training a decision tree is difficult when there is a large number
of features. After a fixed number of trees has been built, the prediction is based on majority voting of all
trees. Most of these trees will be useless and giving random responses, but on average these will cancel
each other out, which results in only the relevant trees adding to the prediction. We used the function
randomForest of the R package “randomForest” (Breiman, 2001) with number of trees set to 500 and
default parameters for this classifier.

3. Results
3.1 Age as potential confounding factor
Since our groups and subgroups significantly differed in terms of age, we calculated the correlation
between age and T-tau, as well as between age and Nf-L.

In most studies, these neurochemical parameters are found to be correlated, but table 3 shows that this
was not the case in our dataset, which might suggest that our study was underpowered to detect this
correlation.

3.2 Data check – special spectra
When we verified the validity of our spectral peak detection algorithm, we found three spectrum categories
and listed them in table 4. We also noticed that AD spectra were generally noisier and had lower amplitude
than FTLD spectra. In a small number of patients, mainly AD, only in a few channels a dominant peak was
found. However, these peaks were often not very pronounced in these patients: less than double the
spectral average.
In a considerable number of participants, mainly FTLD, we detected two dominant EEG peaks in the
spectrum at around 2Hz from each other. Of these two, the peak with the highest frequency was usually in
the (healthy) alpha range, around 9Hz, and the other was usually around 7Hz. The two clearest examples of
spectra with two peaks in either group (AD patient on the left, FTLD right) are shown in figure 1. As a side
note, they both had a non-definite diagnosis.
Looking at definite diagnosis only, no FTLD patient with a weak peak spectrum remained, while almost
none of the AD patients with a double peak remained. Eventually, we found that our spectral peak
detection algorithm was also robust against these special cases of only a few peaks, or two peaks in the
spectrum, and always extracted the most logical one.

Tables 5 and 6 show classification results respectively in the complete and the definite group. Table 5

on NCM or EEG individually.
Including only the participants with a definite diagnosis greatly improved the classification accuracy. Table 6
reveals the same trend in which the NCM features already perform well, but the accuracy increases upon

4. Discussion
We wanted to investigate the value of neurochemical biomarkers and EEG-based markers to distinguish
between the two most common causes of dementia that can still not be diagnosed in vivo with 100%
accuracy. This was a follow-up study on our previous work focussed on the slowed-down dominant EEG
rhythm in AD as compared to FTLD (Goossens et al., 2017). Here, we found that both marker types are able
to reveal unique disease properties, which was shown by an improved classification accuracy after
combination compared to the accuracy of the separate marker types.
First, we confirmed the value of the established neurochemical biomarkers. Using Aβ1-42, T-tau, P-tau181 and
Nf-L for classification, we achieved a differential AD versus FTLD diagnostic accuracy of 82% in the entire
group and nearly 92% in the definite patients. In addition, we found that using the frequency components
of the dominant rhythm detected through EEG allowed a classification of 72% in the whole group and 86%
in the definite group, which is somewhat behind the neurochemical markers. These accuracies show that
both neurochemical markers and EEG markers have a value in distinguishing AD from FTLD and this is a
further improvement upon what we found in our previous study on EEG markers only, of which the results
were already promising (Goossens et al., 2017). The overall higher classification accuracy on the definite
subgroups suggests that clinical misdiagnosis of AD versus FTLD still occurs, despite clinical follow-up that
contributed to clinical diagnostic certainty. Therefore, it remains important to investigate additional
diagnostic markers that can improve the diagnostic accuracy. The results found in this study are very
promising from that perspective.
When we combined the neurochemical and the EEG features, the diagnostic accuracy increased
significantly. In the whole group, the accuracy went up from at best 82% (NCM) to almost 85% (p < 10-15),
while in the definite group only, it went up from at best nearly 92% (NCM) to almost 94% (p = 8.6 x 10-5).
This suggests the NCM and EEG markers are complementary, revealing different aspects of the disease and
therefore confirms again their relevance in developing additional diagnosis tools.
In a number of participants, we detected two dominant EEG peaks. We hypothesise that the mechanism
behind the slowing down of the dominant rhythm is not a literal slowing down, but rather a fading out of
the normal ground rhythm and the appearance of a new, slower rhythm that starts to dominate the first
rhythm. The fact that we only noticed this phenomenon in some of the participants may mean that only
they were in a transient state between normal and slowed dominant rhythm. If such a transient state
exists, there are only two distinct dominant frequencies in the course of the disease, with a clear transition
from the one to the other, i.e. when the slower frequency overtakes the original frequency.
Based on these results, we cannot determine whether everyone goes through this double-peak transition
and at what moment in the course of the disease. This would require a longitudinal study, recruiting people
who have been diagnosed with AD or FTLD, but who still have a healthy dominant rhythm. If this transition
is the true mechanism behind the slowing down of the EEG ground rhythm in AD or FTLD, it probably
happens during at a specific disease stage.
In our population, we noticed a few people with no distinguishable dominant peak in many of the channels,
most of whom had definite AD. The majority of people had one clear dominant peak in every region and
several people had two peaks. In that last group, the patients with AD and two peaks almost all had a
probable diagnosis. In addition, there were more FTLD patients with two peaks than AD, especially in the
definite group. Based on our data, this suggests that this phenomenon occurs more often in FTLD, which
warrants further research.

A possible explanation for having no dominant EEG rhythm could be that the disease has progressed even
further such that even the slow rhythm has started to fade out. This is supported by the fact that almost all
the AD patients who lacked a clear peak had a definite diagnosis, indicating that disease had progressed to
the severe stage. This seemed only valid in the AD group though, as there were no FTLD patients with a
definite, and only two with a probable diagnosis who lacked a clear peak in their spectrum. Together with
the higher prevalence of a double peak in FTLD, these are interesting new pointers towards more detailed
spectral EEG differences between AD and FTLD.
To conclude, we have shown that both neurochemical and EEG biomarkers have very promising value
towards differential diagnosis of AD versus FTLD. Combining both biomarker categories resulted in
classification improvement as compared to their own diagnostic accuracies. Furthermore, we found
evidence that the slowing down of the dominant EEG rhythm might be a gradual appearance of a slow
rhythm and fading out of the healthy ground rhythm, rather than a gradual slowing down of the healthy
rhythm. Finally, we have discovered two differences in the occurrence of the dominant frequency: people
lacking a clear peak almost all had definite AD, while people with two peaks more often had FTLD. These
were unexpected findings that are very interesting to investigate further.
