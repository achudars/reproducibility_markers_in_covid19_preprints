Background

14

Phantom limb pain (PLP) is commonly defined as pain felt in the missing portion of an amputated

15

limb (Ehde, Czerniecki et al. 2000). Some cases of PLP have been reported in people with congenital

16

amputations (Garcia, Flores et al. 2018). However, PLP commonly occurs in people with limb

17

amputations due to trauma or surgery (Neil 2015). It has been proposed that risk factors such as

18

persisting pre-operative pain, diabetic cause of amputation and prosthesis use contribute to the

19

onset of PLP (Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002). Phantom limb pain is common and often associated

20

with negative consequences such as depression and problems with prosthesis use, sleep and

21

participation in activities of daily function (Morgan, Friedly et al. 2017).

22

The prevalence of PLP among people with amputations is unclear, perhaps because of conflicting

23

reports across the literature. While one study reported a high prevalence of 85.6% (Clark, Bowling et

24

al. 2013), another reported a markedly lower prevalence of 0% (Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000). The

25

conflicting reports in the literature regarding the prevalence of PLP are perplexing, but may be due

26

to variations in the time period during which the studies were undertaken, the countries in which

27

the studies were conducted, and the recruitment processes used during collection of

28

epidemiological data (Maimela, Alberts et al. 2016).

29

Low prevalence rates were reported by early studies conducted during a period when PLP was

30

commonly characterised as a psychiatric disorder (Jensen, Krebs et al. 1985). The low prevalence

31

rates could be explained by patients’ fear of reporting their pain to avoid the stigma associated with

32

PLP (Weeks, Anderson-Barnes et al. 2010). Low prevalence rates were also recorded in studies

33

conducted in developing countries where stigma associated with chronic pain conditions is common,

34

and effective strategies to follow up patients after amputations are still lacking (Mishra, Bhatnagar

35

et al. 2008, Gosselin, Gyamfi et al. 2011). Furthermore, many prevalence studies of PLP were

36

conducted in clinical settings using patients continuing with medical care, introducing a selection

37

bias (Sherman, Sherman et al. 1980, Desmond and MacLachlan 2010, Ventham, Heyburn et al. 2010,

38

Byrne 2011, Ahmed, Bhatnagar et al. 2017). Therefore, patients without continuing clinical care may

39

be unaccounted for in these statistics.

40

Prevalence studies are key to informing researchers, clinicians, policy-makers and the public about

41

the burden of diseases in society (Moloi, Watkins et al. 2016). However, the burden of PLP is unclear

42

because of a wide variation in the reported prevalence estimates. To our knowledge, no systematic

43

review has synthesised data on the prevalence and risk factors for PLP. To address this gap in the

44

literature, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by gathering and critically appraising

45

relevant literature regarding the prevalence and associated risk factors for PLP in people with

46

amputations.

47

Objective

48

The primary aim of this systematic review was to estimate the prevalence of PLP in people with

49

amputations. The secondary aim was to determine whether there is a difference in the prevalence of

50

PLP in developed and developing countries as per the World Economic Situation and Prospects

51

classification system (WESP 2018). The exploratory aim was to identify associated risk factors for PLP

52

in people with limb amputations.

53

MATERIAL AND METHODS

54

This systematic review was developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items of

55

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher, Shamseer et al. 2015). The

56

review protocol was registered on PROSPERO - an international prospective register of systematic

57

reviews with health-related outcome, and published in Systematic Reviews (Limakatso, Bedwell et

58

al. 2019). The PRISMA criteria fulfilled by this systematic review are presented in additional file 1.

59

Data sources and search procedure

60

The lead investigator (KL) and a senior librarian (MS) developed a comprehensive search strategy

phantom limb and epidemiology. Articles published between 1980 and July 2019 were identified

63

through a systematic search of the following electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed (via

64

EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (via EBSCOhost), PsycArticles, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health

65

Literature (CINAHL) (via EBSCOhost), Africa-Wide Information (via EBSCOhost), Health Source:

66

Nursing/Academic Edition (via EBSCOhost), SCOPUS, Web of Science and Academic Search Premier

67

(via EBSCOhost). Grey literature was searched on bioRxiv (www.biorxiv.org), Preprints

68

(www.preprints.org), Open Science Framework (www.osf.io) and medRxiv (www.medrxiv.org). The

69

reference lists of eligible studies were searched manually to identify more studies that may have

70

been eligible for inclusion in this review. Studies identified from the literature search were saved

71

using the citation manager software programme (EndNote x8), which was also used to remove

72

duplicates (Rathvon 2017).

73

Study selection

74

We included case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies that investigated the prevalence of PLP

75

in surgical, traumatic and congenital upper or lower limb amputees who were 18 years or older. The

76

risk factors for PLP were identified from the included studies. Only studies written in English, with

77

full text available, were eligible for inclusion in this review. We excluded studies that did not meet

78

the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers (KL and GJB) independently screened study titles and abstracts

79

for eligibility. Studies identified in the initial screening as potentially eligible were assessed for

80

eligibility in full-text form by the same reviewers, using the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study

81

selection procedure was performed using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (2016) on which the studies

82

were listed and marked as either eligible or ineligible. A PRISMA flow diagram (Fig 1) represents the

83

entire screening process detailing the numbers of included and excluded studies, with reasons for

84

exclusion. After each stage, results were compared, and disagreements resolved through discussion.

87

Risk of bias assessment

88

Two reviewers (KL and GJB) independently assessed the included articles for risk of bias using a risk

89

of bias assessment tool for prevalence studies that had been developed by Hoy et al (Hoy, Brooks et

90

al. 2012). This tool assesses the risk of bias based on 10 categories which evaluate the study’s

91

external and internal validity. Each category of the risk of bias tool was set as “high risk” if the study

92

scored “high risk” for any single item within that category, and “low risk” if it scored “low risk” for all

93

items in that category. Categories with “low risk” and “high risk” were given a rating of zero and one

94

respectively. The summary risk of bias rating for each study was presented as “low risk” (score: 0-3),

95

“moderate risk” (score: 4-6), or “high risk” (score: 7-10).

96

Data extraction

97

Two reviewers (KL and GJB) used a pre-piloted customised data extraction sheet to independently

98

extract relevant data from included studies. Data extracted included: the names of authors, year of

99

study publication, study design and setting, country of study, sample size, participants’ age and sex,

100

site of amputation, method of data collection, PLP prevalence (%), as well as risk factors and their

101

measures of association with PLP. The developmental status of the countries in which the studies

102

were conducted was identified using the World Economic Situation and Prospects classification

103

system (WESP 2018).

104

Data analysis

105

Data extracted from individual studies were entered into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. All meta-

106

analyses were conducted using Open Meta Analyst software available on

107

(http://www.cebm.brown.edu/openmeta). In this, we deviated from the registered protocol, which

108

specified the use of Review Manager 5, because Review Manager 5 is not suitable for conducting

109

meta-analyses of single arm studies. Cohen's Kappa was used to report inter-rater agreement during

110

screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and can be interpreted as minimal (0-0.39),

111

weak (0.40-0.59), moderate (0.60-0.79) or strong (0.80-0.90) (Cohen 1960). Clinical heterogeneity

112

was evaluated qualitatively, based on similarities or differences in participant and outcome

113

characteristics, recruitment and assessment procedures, and study setting (Gagnier, Moher et al.

114

2012). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, and the results were presented as

115

low (<25%), moderate (25-50%) and high (>50%) (Higgins, Thompson et al. 2003). Subject to

116

consideration of heterogeneity and risk of bias, studies were pooled for meta-analysis using a

117

random effects model to determine a sample-weighted summary estimate of PLP prevalence across

118

all included studies. A funnel plot was generated to assess for possible publication bias. In addition,

119

the Egger’s test was conducted to assess the funnel plot for asymmetry (Egger, Smith et al. 1997). To

120

address high statistical heterogeneity, we deviated from protocol to sub-group studies into those

121

with low risk of bias and those with moderate and high risk of bias, and conducted separate meta-

122

analyses, and compared the two pooled estimates using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. We also

123

sub-grouped studies by the developmental status of the country in which each study had been

124

conducted (WESP 2018), as planned in the protocol and, again, compared the estimates using a two-

125

tailed Mann-Whitney U test. Potential risk factors for PLP were identified from the included studies

126

and synthesised descriptively. When an association was confirmed, the strength of association

127

between PLP and each risk factor was classified as either “weak”, “moderate”, “strong” or “very

128

strong”, according to the guidelines for interpreting the strength of association in epidemiology

129

studies (Rosenthal 1996, Nicolich and Gamble 2011, Healey 2014, Allen 2017). We calculated Phi (Ø)

130

to determine the strength of association in studies that used the chi-square test as a measure of

131

association. This sample-size-adjusted chi-square statistic has been shown to provide a more

132

accurate reflection of the strength of association between two variables than the interpretation of

133

chi-square and probability (P) values, where high chi-square and p values are thought to represent a

134

strong association between variables (Frankfort-Nachmias and Leon-Guerrero 2017). Alpha was set

135

at 0.05 for all analyses.

Results

138

The initial literature search returned 2677 records, of which 1783 remained after the removal of

139

duplicates. Initial screening of titles and abstracts identified 85 studies that were eligible for full-text

140

review. Full-text review identified 37 studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review. Three of

141

these studies reported two studies each (Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000, Reiber, McFarland et al.

142

2010, Byrne 2011). Therefore, a total of 40 data sets were included in our analysis. The screening

143

process reflected moderate agreement (Kappa=0.70) between reviewers.

144

Study characteristics

145

The study characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The included studies had used cross-sectional

146

(n=38) and cohort (n=2) study designs. Thirty-three of 40 studies had been conducted in developed

147

countries (WESP 2018). Of these, the majority had been conducted in North America [USA (n=7);

148

Canada (n=2)] and Europe [United Kingdom (n=8); Germany (n=5); Netherlands (n=4); Ireland (n=2);

149

Poland (n=1)] (Fig 2). Only seven studies had been conducted in developing countries [Iran (n=2);

150

Iraq (n=1); India (n=1); Brazil (n=1); Pakistan (n=1); Cambodia (n=1)]. Table 1 reflects the wide range

151

of data collection approaches used by the studies. The included studies had been published between

152

1986 and 2019. The data extraction process had moderate agreement (Kappa=0.71) between

153

reviewers prior to discussion.

The eligible studies provided data from a total of 12765 participants (9826 male; 2196 female) who

158

had undergone upper limb (n=2784) and lower limb (n=10539) amputations. Participant

159

characteristics are provided in Table 1.

161

Risk of bias assessment

162

The risk of bias assessment revealed moderate agreement (Kappa=0.69) between reviewers prior to

163

discussion. The results of the risk of bias assessment are reported in Table 2. Four studies had an

164

overall rating of “low risk” (Rayegani, Aryanmehr et al. 2010, Rahimi, Mousavi et al. 2012, Aldington,

165

Small et al. 2014, Hnoosh 2014). Six studies scored “low risk” for selection bias, for using a sample

166

that was a close representation of the national population (Ephraim, Wegener et al. 2005, Kern,

167

Busch et al. 2009, Rahimi, Mousavi et al. 2012, Hnoosh 2014, Bekrater-Bodmann, Schredl et al. 2015,

168

Morgan, Friedly et al. 2017). Eight studies scored “low risk” for study participation bias, because

169

their response rates for participation were ≥75% (Wartan, Hamann et al. 1997, Kooijman, Dijkstra et

170

al. 2000, Datta, Selvarajah et al. 2004, Richardson, Glenn et al. 2006, Rayegani, Aryanmehr et al.

171

2010, Rahimi, Mousavi et al. 2012, Rafferty, Bennett Britton et al. 2015, Morgan, Friedly et al. 2017).

172

Twelve studies scored “low risk” for measurement bias, for using a clear definition of PLP (Ehde,

173

Czerniecki et al. 2000, Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002, Ephraim, Wegener et al. 2005, Hanley, Ehde et

174

al. 2006, Ketz 2008, Desmond and MacLachlan 2010, Rayegani, Aryanmehr et al. 2010, Aldington,

175

Small et al. 2014, Hnoosh 2014, Bekrater-Bodmann, Schredl et al. 2015, Bin Ayaz, Ikram et al. 2015,

176

Noguchi, Saito et al. 2019). Other studies scored “high risk” for measurement bias, for not providing

177

a clear definition of PLP (e.g pain felt in the limb after amputation). All the studies scored “high risk”

178

for measurement bias, for using an instrument that has not been shown to be valid and reliable for

179

measuring the outcome of interest. However, all studies scored “low risk” for reporting bias, for

180

appropriately reporting the numerators and denominators for the outcome of interest.

Prevalence of phantom limb pain

183

The estimates of PLP prevalence in people with limb amputations ranged between 0% and 85.6%

184

(Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000, Clark, Bowling et al. 2013), with most studies (31 out of 40) reporting

185

a prevalence between 50% and 85.6% (Byrne 2011, Clark, Bowling et al. 2013). A prevalence of 0%

186

was reported by the only included study that investigated PLP in adults with congenital amputations

187

(Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000). The pooling of all studies using a random effects model yielded an

188

estimated prevalence of 63% [95% CI: 58.23-67.05], but with high statistical heterogeneity

189

[I2=95.70% (95% CI: 95.10-96.20)] (Fig 3). The Egger’s regression analysis of all the included studies

190

revealed no publication bias [-0.85 (95%CI: -4.13-2.43); p=0.60].

191

Exploratory subgrouping

192

We were concerned by the high statistical heterogeneity in the primary meta-analysis, so we opted

193

to deviate from protocol to conduct two exploratory meta-analyses with studies sub-grouped

194

according to risk of bias score. The first exploratory subgroup analysis, including only the studies that

195

scored low risk of bias overall, estimated prevalence at 63% [95% CI: 58.31-67.90] with moderate

196

statistical heterogeneity [I2=44.91 (95% CI: 43.90-45.20)] (Fig 4). The second exploratory subgroup

197

analysis, including only the studies with moderate-high risk of bias, estimated prevalence at 63%

198

[95% CI: 56.83-68.40], but with high statistical heterogeneity [I2=97.75% (95% CI: 96.17-98.76)] (Fig

199

5). The Mann-Whitney U test that served as the sensitivity analysis for the effect of moderate-high

200

risk of bias showed no difference between the estimated prevalence from these two meta-analyses

201

[U=58.5, p=0.22].

Risk factors for phantom limb pain

218

Twenty-five potential risk factors had been studied in 15 studies representing 4102 participants. Of

219

these, 10 pre-amputation, three peri-operative and eight post-amputation risk factors had data to

220

support their positive association with PLP, and six pre-amputation, four peri-operative and three

221

post-amputation risk factors had not been found to be positively associated with PLP. The risk

222

factors found to be positively associated with PLP and their measures of association are summarised

223

in Table 3.

224

Table 3. The summary of the risk factors for PLP and their measures of association with PLP.

225

Lower limb amputation was positively associated with PLP (moderate to strong association) in two

226

studies representing a total of 1450 participants (Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002, Ephraim, Wegener et

227

al. 2005). Stump pain was consistently positively associated with PLP (weak to very strong

228

association) in seven studies representing a total of 1254 participants (Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000,

229

Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002, Richardson, Glenn et al. 2006, Hanley, Jensen et al. 2007, Desmond

230

and MacLachlan 2010, Ahmed, Bhatnagar et al. 2017, Larbig, Andoh et al. 2019). Phantom sensations

231

were consistently positively associated with PLP (strong to very strong association) in four studies

232

representing a total of 1156 participants (Wartan, Hamann et al. 1997, Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000,

233

Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002, Razmus, Daniluk et al. 2017). Proximal site of amputation was

234

positively associated with PLP (very strong association) in two studies representing a total of 604

235

participants (Gallagher, Butterworth et al. 1998, Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002). Diabetic cause of

236

amputation was positively associated with PLP (moderate to strong association) in two studies

237

representing a total of 580 participants (Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002, Noguchi, Saito et al. 2019).

238

Persistent pre-amputation pain was positively associated with PLP in five studies representing a total

239

of 881 participants (weak to very strong association) (Larbig, Montoya et al. 1996, Hanley, Jensen et

240

al. 2007, Ahmed, Bhatnagar et al. 2017, Yin, Zhang et al. 2017, Noguchi, Saito et al. 2019) but was

241

not associated with PLP in two studies representing a total of 625 participants. The risk factors which

242

were not found to be positively associated with PLP are summarised in Table 4. Sex, age and

243

traumatic cause of amputation were the most commonly assessed of these proposed risk factors.

Sex was consistently not associated with PLP in six studies representing a total of 1836 participants

245

(Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000, Ephraim, Wegener et al. 2005, Dijkstra 2006, Hanley, Ehde et al.

246

2009, Ahmed, Bhatnagar et al. 2017, Noguchi, Saito et al. 2019). Age was not associated with PLP in

247

three studies representing a total of 1062 participants (Ephraim, Wegener et al. 2005, Hanley, Ehde

248

et al. 2009, Noguchi, Saito et al. 2019) but higher age was positively associated with PLP (weak

249

association) in one study representing a total of 716 participants (Buchanan and Mandel 1986). A

250

traumatic cause of amputation was not associated with PLP in two studies representing a total of

251

958 participants (Ephraim, Wegener et al. 2005, Noguchi, Saito et al. 2019) but was positively

252

associated with PLP (very strong association) in one study representing a total of 104 participants

253

(Gallagher, Allen et al. 2001). The meta-analysis of risk factors for PLP could not be conducted

254

because of variations in methods of data collection and analysis across the included studies.

Discussion

259

According to our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to pool the literature on the

260

prevalence and risk factors for PLP in people with limb amputations. The results of this study

261

estimate that PLP affects 63% of people with amputations. In addition, this study identified that

262

lower limb amputation, stump pain, phantom sensations, persistent pre-amputation pain, proximal

263

site of amputation and diabetic cause of amputation are risk factors for PLP.

264

Phantom limb pain prevalence

265

The current primary meta-analysis estimated that 63% of people with amputations report PLP. This

266

estimate suggests that approximately 8042 of 12765 participants in this study reported PLP.

267

Interestingly, dividing studies by risk of bias revealed no difference in estimated prevalence, despite

268

the ‘low risk of bias’ subgroup’s meta-analysis having lower statistical heterogeneity. In addition, the

269

results of the Egger’s regression test indicated that the asymmetry of the funnel plot (Fig 8) was not

270

significant (p=0.60), thus failing to suggest the presence of publication bias. Altogether, these

271

findings suggest that the included studies provide a reasonably stable estimate of the prevalence of

272

PLP in the population of people with amputations. The prevalence of PLP appears to be high,

273

supporting that health professionals should be aware of the risk of this complication and that

274

pragmatic interventions for preventing or alleviating PLP are needed.

276

The meta-analysis that stratified the studies by country developmental status suggested that the

277

prevalence of PLP was significantly lower in developing countries compared to developed countries

278

[53.98% vs 64.55%; p=0.04]. This discrepancy is surprising and might be an artefact of selection bias

279

linked either to the lower response rate seen in most of the studies conducted in developing

280

countries, or to the strategy of recruiting participants from amongst patients receiving follow-up

281

medical care. This recruitment strategy common in the developing country studies may have

282

contributed to underestimation of PLP prevalence if amputees with PLP (in developing countries)

283

without continuing medical care were excluded from samples, or may have contributed to an

284

overestimation of PLP prevalence if having PLP made amputees more likely to remain in medical

285

care. This uncertainty highlights the need to develop and implement novel recruitment strategies

286

specific to people with amputations in developing countries so that they can be accounted for in

287

future studies.

288

The included studies had varying risk of bias. However, the lack of statistically significant difference

289

between the prevalence estimates from pooling of the studies with low risk of bias and pooling of

290

the studies with moderate-high risk of bias suggests that the overall risk of bias in included studies

291

had little impact on the prevalence of PLP. Nonetheless, the high risk of bias attributed to most

292

studies for using an ambiguous definition of PLP (e.g pain felt in the limb after amputation) leaves

293

the possibility that participants might have confused residual limb pain and PLP. We suspect that this

294

might have resulted in an overestimation of the prevalence of PLP.

295

It is noteworthy that a prevalence of 0% was reported by the only study in this review that

296

investigated PLP in adults with congenital amputations (Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000). These

297

findings are similar to those of other studies (not eligible for this review) that reported a low PLP

298

prevalence of 7% (out of 57 patients) and 5.7% (out of 88 patients) in children with congenital

299

amputations (Boonstra, Rijnders et al. 2000, Garcia, Flores et al. 2018). Although a robust conclusion

300

cannot be drawn from three small studies, these findings suggest that people with congenital

301

amputations may be less likely to experience PLP than those whose amputations were due to

302

trauma or surgery (Gallagher, Allen et al. 2001). Perhaps the peripheral nerves severed during

303

amputation play an important role in the initiation of PLP after amputation (Vaso, Adahan et al.

304

2014). In addition, the absence of pre-operative and peri-operative risk factors for PLP in this group

305

might contribute to the low prevalence.

307

Phantom limb pain risk factors

308

Five studies showed that PLP was more likely to occur in people who reported a history of persistent

309

pre-operative pain than in those who did not report having had persistent limb pain prior to their

310

amputation. One physiological mechanism that has been proposed to explain the link between pre-

311

amputation pain and PLP is central sensitisation - where persistent pre-operative pain contributes to

312

the hyperexcitability of the nervous system and functional changes in the cortical areas involved in

313

the generation of pain (Lee, Zambreanu et al. 2008). These changes may continue to upregulate

314

peripheral input after limb amputation, thus promoting PLP that shares the characteristics with pre-

315

amputation pain (Rathmell and Kehlet 2011). In fact, over 60% of the patients who experienced

316

persistent pre-amputation pain reported similar characteristics of their PLP (Jensen, Krebs et al.

317

1985, Katz and Melzack 1990). This apparent relationship highlights the importance of addressing

318

limb pain very early in patients who are at high risk of having their limbs amputated. The early and

319

effective management of pre-amputation pain may reduce risk of developing PLP and improve

320

physical and psychological outcomes often related to delayed or ineffective management of PLP

321

(Hanley, Jensen et al. 2004, Hanley, Jensen et al. 2007)

322

Two studies showed that PLP was more likely to occur after lower limb amputation than after upper

323

limb amputation (Ephraim, Wegener et al. 2005, Dijkstra 2006). The authors proposed that the use

324

of a cosmetic prosthetic leg, rather than a prosthesis that provided sensory input was a likely

325

contributor to pain in people with lower limb amputations since 70%-78.8% of cosmetic prosthetic

326

leg users had PLP. Lack of proprioceptive feedback during the use of a prosthetic leg has been linked

327

to poor motor control, possibly leading to stump irritation that may trigger PLP (Morgan, Friedly et

328

al. 2017, Page, George et al. 2018). This proposed link is partially supported by seven studies in this

329

review which suggested that PLP was more likely to occur in people with stump pain than in those

330

without stump pain (Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000, Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002, Hanley, Ehde et al.

331

332

Larbig, Andoh et al. 2019). Interestingly, Dietrich and colleagues investigated the effects of a leg

333

prosthesis with somatosensory feedback on pain and lower limb function (Dietrich, Nehrdich et al.

334

2018). In that study, participants used prosthetic legs with pressure sensors that provided

335

comfortable electrical feedback to the patient’s thigh whenever the prosthetic foot touched the

336

ground. At the end of two weeks of training, the participants had improved function of the lower

337

limb and reduced severity and frequency of PLP. Further, the patients reported greater satisfaction,

338

longer walking distances and improved dynamic stability than prior to the training. These results

339

suggest that people with lower limb amputations might benefit more from using a prosthetic leg

340

with somatosensory feedback than from using a cosmetic prosthesis. However, the mechanisms by

341

which prosthetic legs with somatosensory feedback reduce PLP are not clear. Therefore, it would be

342

interesting to investigate the mechanisms by which somatosensory feedback from a prosthetic leg

343

might influence PLP.

344

Four studies showed that PLP was more likely to occur in amputees with non-painful phantom

345

sensations than in those without non-painful phantom sensations (Wartan, Hamann et al. 1997,

346

Kooijman, Dijkstra et al. 2000, Razmus, Daniluk et al. 2017). In these studies, 70%-100% of amputees

347

with phantom sensations also had PLP. The co-occurrence of these post-amputation sensations

348

suggest that they may share neural mechanisms with PLP (Razmus, Daniluk et al. 2017). An fMRI

349

study by Andoh et al showed that inducing non-painful phantom sensations in people with

350

amputations activated the somatosensory and premotor cortices contralateral to the amputated

351

limb (Andoh, Diers et al. 2017). The activation of similar cortical areas has been recorded in patients

352

with PLP upon induction of their PLP (Flor and Elbert 1995, Lotze, Montoya et al. 1999, Karl,

353

Birbaumer et al. 2001, Lotze, Flor et al. 2001, Flor, Nikolajsen et al. 2006). The similarities in cortical

354

activation patterns might explain a link between PLP and non-painful phantom sensations.

355

Two studies showed that PLP was more likely to occur in people with proximal amputations than in

356

those with distal amputations (Gallagher, Allen et al. 2001, Dijkstra, Geertzen et al. 2002). These

15

357

findings line up with a narrative review that reported an increase in the incidence of PLP with more

358

proximal amputations (Manchikanti and Singh 2004). Proximal amputations are associated with an

359

increased risk of failure of wound healing, which may result in infection or stump pain (Stone,

360

Flaherty et al. 2006). However, the reasons why proximal amputations should be more likely to lead

361

to PLP than distal amputations are not clear (Kelle, Kozanoglu et al. 2017).

362

Another interesting finding was that the lack of pre-amputation counselling was positively associated

363

with PLP (strong association) in a study representing a total of 104 participants (Gallagher, Allen et

364

al. 2001). This suggests that patients who receive counselling prior to their amputation maybe less

365

likely to report PLP compared to those who do not receive counselling. The exact details of the

366

counselling were not reported. However, the strong association between the pre-operative

367

counselling and pain reduction highlights the importance of pre-amputation counselling on PLP. No

368

other study has specifically identified pre-operative counselling as a predictor of decreased PLP after

369

limb amputation. However, the results of a narrative review suggest that pre-operative counselling

370

may improve outcomes in patients undergoing various forms of surgery (Powell, Scott et al. 2016).

371

Limitations

372

The sample in this systematic review was skewed towards males, in that 9826 (81.73%) of the 12022

373

participants were male. Therefore, the results might not hold for females. We could not perform a

374

subgroup analysis by sex because we did not have individual patient data, nor was analysis by sex an

375

objective identified in the protocol. However, the data on risk factors provide no support for sex

376

influencing the likelihood of PLP after amputation. It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis on

377

the risk factors for PLP because the included studies used varying methodological approaches and

378

measures of association. None of the included studies used an outcome measure that has been

379

validated for assessing PLP. In fact, we are not aware of any instrument that has been validated for

380

assessing PLP. Such a standardised tool for assessing PLP would be useful to provide us with reliable

381

data. Most studies in this review had moderate-high risk of bias. There is a clear need for high16

382

quality studies to raise the credibility of future meta-analyses. Finally, the search strategy for this

383

study was designed specifically to identify prevalence studies. Therefore, although we did conduct

384

an exploratory search for additional studies of risk factors for PLP, there is a possibility that we could

385

have missed some studies that investigated risk factors for PLP if they did not also estimate PLP

386

prevalence. In consideration of this possibility, the review of risk factors was classified as an

387

exploratory analysis. It is important to note that the results of this systematic review were derived

388

from studies conducted mostly in Europe, North-America and Asia. To the best of our knowledge, no

389

study has been conducted in Africa, and research in this area is indicated to inform us about the

390

burden and risk factors for PLP in the African population.

391

Conclusion

392

This systematic review and meta-analysis estimates that six of every 10 people with an amputation

393

report PLP – a high and important prevalence of PLP. Health care professionals ought to be aware of

394

the high rates of PLP and implement strategies to reduce PLP by addressing known risk factors,

395

specifically those identified by the current study. Stump pain and post-amputation depression are all

396

known and modifiable risk factors that are consistently positively associated with PLP. Awareness of

397

these risk factors may motivate health care professionals to address them early in treatment to

398

prevent the onset of PLP in people with amputations.
