ABSTRACT

26

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with HIV acquisition and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

27

Recurrence after metronidazole treatment is high. HIV-negative, non-pregnant Rwandan BV

28

patients were randomized to four groups (n=17/group) after seven-day oral metronidazole

29

treatment: behavioral counseling only (control), or counseling plus intermittent use of oral

30

metronidazole, Ecologic Femi+ vaginal capsule (containing multiple Lactobacillus and one

31

Bifidobacterium species), or Gynophilus LP vaginal tablet (L. rhamnosus 35) for two months.

32

Vaginal microbiota assessments at all visits included Gram stain Nugent scoring and 16S rRNA

33

gene qPCR and HiSeq sequencing. All interventions were safe. BV (Nugent 7-10) incidence was

34

10.18 per person-year at risk in the control group, and lower in the metronidazole (1.41/person-

35

year; p=0.004), Ecologic Femi+ (3.58/person-year; p=0.043), and Gynophilus LP groups

36

(5.36/person-year; p=0.220). In mixed effects models adjusted for hormonal

37

contraception/pregnancy, sexual risk-taking, and age, metronidazole and Ecologic Femi+ users,

38

each compared to controls, had higher Lactobacillus and lower BV-anaerobes concentrations

39

and/or relative abundances, and were less likely to have a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota type by

40

sequencing. Inter-individual variability was high and effects disappeared soon after intervention

41

cessation. Lactobacilli-based vaginal probiotics warrant further evaluation because, in contrast to

42

antibiotics, they are not expected to negatively affect microbiota or cause antimicrobial

43

resistance.

INTRODUCTION

46

Most women have a vaginal microbiota (VMB) that consists predominantly of lactobacilli1. The

47

most common type of vaginal dysbiosis is bacterial vaginosis (BV), characterized by a decrease

48

in lactobacilli and increase in other anaerobes, which affects 30-40% of women worldwide2.

49

Other types of bacterial dysbiosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are

50

also common. These conditions are associated with vaginal inflammation, thereby increasing the

51

risk of HIV acquisition3. They are also associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility,

52

and adverse pregnancy outcomes2.

53
54

The majority of women seeking care for vaginal symptoms receive antibiotic or antifungal

55

treatment empirically or syndromically without any diagnostic testing4. In some specialized

56

clinics, women might be offered limited diagnostic testing, such as vaginal pH determination

57

and/or wet mount microscopy. In research settings, BV is typically diagnosed by the Amsel

58

criteria or Nugent scoring5,6, with the latter currently being considered the gold standard: Gram-

59

stained vaginal smears are scored based on microscopic visualization of three bacterial

60

morphotypes with a score of 0-3 considered normal, 4-6 intermediate, and 7-10 BV regardless of

61

symptoms. In the last 15 years, molecular methods have become more widely available, and

62

have been applied to the VMB, although mostly in descriptive studies to date1.

63
64

Evidence is mounting that ‘microbiological-BV’ (by Nugent scoring or molecular methods) can

65

cause long-term adverse outcomes in the presence or absence of vaginal symptoms2. BV is

66

notoriously difficult to treat7–9. About 60-80% of patients are cured after a course of oral or

67

vaginal metronidazole or clindamycin, but recurrence rates are high7. Therapies to restore and

68

maintain an optimal lactobacilli-dominated VMB after antibiotic treatment are not standard

69

practice, but some clinicians in Europe and North America recommend twice weekly 0.75%

70

metronidazole vaginal gel for 4-6 months to lower the risk of BV recurrence7. This

71

recommendation was tested in a randomized controlled trial in the USA, which showed a

72

statistically significant reduction in BV recurrence (34% by Nugent scoring)10. In addition, two

73

African trials evaluating oral (2g monthly) and vaginal metronidazole (five nights every three

74

months) for BV prevention showed significant beneficial effects, but the effects were modest,

75

most likely due to infrequent dosing11,12.

76
77

Probiotic lactobacilli may be able to restore and maintain a lactobacilli-dominated VMB, may be

78

better able to prevent or disrupt BV-associated biofilms than antibiotics, and can likely be used

79

safely for long periods without the risk of causing antimicrobial resistance13. Lactobacilli-

80

containing vaginal probiotic clinical trials to date have shown mixed results, but eight of the 12

81

trials showed sufficiently promising efficacy for BV prevention to warrant further

82

investigation13–24. Some trials used commercially available probiotic strains (mostly derived

83

from the gut or fermented foods) and others vaginal strains isolated from healthy women25, but

84

efficacy signals were similar for the two probiotic strain categories13–24. None of the trials

85

reported major safety concerns or colonization beyond the dosing period. Because ‘natural’

86

strains do not seem to outperform commercially available strains, and for pragmatic reasons, we

87

chose to evaluate two vaginal probiotics that are currently on the market. Our aim was to assess

88

their safety and impact on the VMB in much more detail than previous trials had done, and to

89

develop data analytic methods to enable use of high-dimensional 16S rRNA gene sequencing

90

data for this purpose. The two probiotics that we evaluated were Ecologic Femi+ vaginal capsule

91

(EF+; Winclove Probiotics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and Gynophilus LP vaginal tablet

92

(GynLP; Biose, Arpajon-sur-Cère, France). EF+ contains multiple lyophilized bacteria

(Bifidobacterium bifidum W28, Lactobacillus acidophilus W70, L. helveticus W74, L. brevis

94

W63, L. plantarum W21, and L. salivarius W24) in a total dose of 1.5x109 colony forming units

95

(CFU). GynLP contains 1.6x109 CFU of Lcr Regenerans, a culture of the L. rhamnosus 35

96

(Lcr35) strain. The tablet disintegrates in the vagina after forming a gel to release Lcr35.

97

Gynophilus (the same active ingredient as GynLP but a different formulation) had shown

98

promise in preventing BV recurrence in a previous trial, but EF+ had not previously been studied

99

for this indication15.

100
101

METHODS

102

From June 2015 until February 2016, we conducted a randomized clinical trial in Kigali,

103

Rwanda, to evaluate intermittent use of the above-mentioned vaginal probiotics as well as oral

104

metronidazole (Tricozole, Laboratory & Allied ltd, Nairobi, Kenya) to prevent the recurrence of

105

microbiological-BV after metronidazole treatment. The trial was a pilot trial with a modest

106

sample size (N=68) at the request of the funder.

107
108

Eligibility

109

Women were eligible for screening if they were aged 18-45, in good overall physical and mental

110

health, and at high urogenital infection risk defined as having had more than one sex partner in

111

the last 12 months or having been treated for a sexually transmitted infection and/or BV in the

112

last 12 months. They were eligible for enrollment if they were confirmed HIV-negative and non-

113

pregnant, were diagnosed with BV (by Nugent score and/or Amsel criteria) and/or TV (by wet

114

mount and/or culture), and were cured after seven days of oral metronidazole treatment (500 mg

115

twice per day)5. Cure was defined as no BV by Amsel criteria and no TV by wet mount6. We did

116

not use Nugent scores and TV culture as tests-of-cure to allow for same day enrollment but

117

results became available after enrollment. At enrollment, 51/68 women were BV-negative by

118

Amsel and Nugent criteria, 17/68 women were BV-negative by Amsel but BV-positive by

119

Nugent criteria, and all women were TV-negative by both wet mount and culture and free of

120

symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis, urinary tract infection, syphilis, and clinician-observed

121

genital abnormalities or vaginal discharge. We did not exclude women with gonorrhea and/or

122

chlamydia because the local testing turn-around time was slow. Positive herpes simplex type 2

123

serology was not a reason for exclusion. Additional exclusion criteria applied but these were rare

124

(Figure 1, Supplement 1).

125
126

Randomization groups and visit schedule

127

Women were randomized to four groups (17 women per group) within three days of completing

128

oral metronidazole treatment: 1) behavioral counseling only (control group); 2) counseling plus

129

500 mg oral metronidazole twice weekly for two months; 3) counseling plus EF+ vaginal capsule

130

once per day for the first five days followed by thrice weekly for a total of two months; and 4)

131

counseling plus GynLP once every four days for two months. Participants applied the first dose

132

of their intervention under direct observation at the enrollment visit, and returned to the clinic

133

after seven days (D7), one month (M1), two months (M2; cessation of product use), and six

134

months (M6). They were allowed to cease vaginal product use temporarily during menstruation.

135

Product adherence was assessed by review of diary cards, used and unused products, and by a

136

self-rating adherence scale. Symptomatic BV, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and urinary tract

137

infections, and laboratory-confirmed sexually transmitted infections, diagnosed during follow-up

138

were treated using standard oral therapies, and women were urged to continue their interventions

139

during treatment. Visit procedures are summarized in Figure 1 and described in Supplement 1.

141

Diagnostic testing

142

Women were tested for BV, TV, and vulvovaginal candidiasis at each visit. BV was diagnosed by

143

Gram stain Nugent scoring5 and Amsel criteria6; the vaginal pH was measured by pressing a pH

144

paper strip (pH range 3.6 – 6.1 with 0.3 increments; Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany) against

145

the vaginal wall. TV was diagnosed when motile trichomonads were observed on wet mount and

146

by InPouch culture (Biomed Diagnostics, White City, OR, USA). Vulvovaginal candidiasis was

147

diagnosed when budding yeasts and/or (pseudo)hyphae were observed on wet mount. All other

148

diagnostic tests (Supplement 1) were only done at screening, M6, and when judged clinically

149

necessary by the physician, with the exception of pregnancy and urinalysis tests, which were

150

repeated at enrollment prior to randomization.

151
152

16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR

153

We collected vaginal swabs at 639 time points, including study visits of all 68 women and self-

154

sampled swabs from 12 women (three per group) who had been asked to self-sample at home

155

every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during the first month. Self-sampled swabs were

156

processed but were not included in analyses unless stated. DNA was extracted from one swab per

157

time point per woman. Briefly, DNA was extracted using a combination of lysozyme lysis,

158

Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), and bead-beating procedures.

159

Purified DNA underwent two PCR rounds: amplification of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region

160

and dual-index barcoding allowing multiplexing of up to 384 samples. Samples were sequenced

161

on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), run in rapid mode,

162

2x300bp using a 250PE and 50PE kit. All samples collected from the same participant were

163

included in the same run. Negative and positive controls (ZymoBiomics Microbial Community

164

DNA standard; Zymo Research Corp, Irvine, USA) were incorporated throughout. The

panbacterial 16S rRNA gene copy concentrations of physician-collected samples of enrolled

166

women with valid sequencing results (N=393) were determined by BactQuant qPCR assay as

167

previously described26.

168
169

Molecular data processing

170

Reads were demultiplexed, and primer sequences removed using Cutadapt v1.2.127. Error

171

correction, dereplication, denoising, merging, removal of chimeras, and taxonomic assignment

172

were performed in DADA2 v1.4.0 using Silva v128 as the reference database (Supplement

173

1)28,29. Further data processing included removal of rare, non-bacterial, and contaminant

174

amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and identification of vaginal and probiotic sequences that

175

are not included in the Silva database using the NCBI Needleman-Wunsch Global Align

176

Nucleotide Sequences function15 (Supplement 1). Silva-based taxonomic assignments of non-

177

minority ASVs were double-checked using the NCBI Microbial Nucleotide BLAST function,

178

using the non-redundant V3-V4 version of the Vaginal 16S rDNA Reference Database as a

179

tiebreaker30,31. We rarefied at 1,111 reads using the GUniFrac 1.0 package in R32. This yielded

180

401 unique ASVs in 629 samples, mapping to species (n=255; 63.6%), genus (n=116; 28.9%), or

181

higher taxonomic level (n=30; 7.5%). Concentrations in cells/μl per ASV per sample were

182

estimated by multiplying the ASV-specific copy-normalized relative abundance by the sample-

183

specific 16S rRNA gene copies concentration33,34. Heatmaps of the 20 most common ASVs by

184

sample are shown in Figure S1A for relative abundances and Figure S1B for concentrations.

185

VMB data reduction was required for molecular efficacy analyses, and was done in three

186

different ways. First, the Simpson diversity index (1-D) was calculated for each sample. Second,

187

each ASV was assigned to one of four ‘bacterial groups’ based on the published literature

188

190

(anaerobic bacteria that have consistently been associated with BV); 3) pathobionts (bacteria that

191

are considered to have higher intrinsic pathogenicity than BV-anaerobes and have not

192

consistently been associated with BV35); and 4) ‘other bacteria’ (a rest group, consisting mostly

193

of skin bacteria and Bifidobacterium species). Within each sample, read counts of ASVs

194

belonging to the same bacterial group were summed. This resulted in four relative abundances

195

(one for each bacterial group) per sample, which sum to 1.0 for each sample. Third, we used

196

hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distance to pool samples into eight mutually exclusive

197

VMB types (each sample was assigned to only one VMB type): 1) L. iners-dominated (Li, n=247

198

samples); 2) L. crispatus-dominated (Lcr, n=17); 3) other lactobacilli-dominated (Lo, n=28); 4)

201

dominated (GV, n=41); and 8) pathobionts-containing (PB, n=49) (Supplement 1).

Downstream statistical analysis

204

Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities v19.1

205

(McLean, VA, USA). Data were analyzed using STATA v13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,

206

USA). Most statistical comparisons were between randomization groups (each intervention

207

group compared to the control group) at screening, enrollment, and longitudinally over time. For

208

cross-sectional analyses, we used Fisher’s exact test for binary and categorical variables, and

209

Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests for continuous variables. For longitudinal analyses,

210

we used incidence rates, incidence rate ratios, and mixed effects models. We conducted intent-to-

211

treat (ITT) analyses, and modified ITT analyses limited to women who were BV-negative by

212

both Amsel and Nugent criteria at the time of randomization (n=51 of 68). All mixed models

RESULTS

230

Participant disposition

231

Of the 68 randomized women, only four did not complete the trial (Figure 1), resulting in 29.93

232

person-years of data. The median age was 31 (interquartile range (IQR) 27-35) (Table 1, Table

233

S1). The majority of women (92.6%) had exchanged sex for money or goods, and had had a

234

median of five (IQR 2-18) sex partners, in the past month. All but three women used condoms,

235

but mostly inconsistently. Two-thirds of the women (61.8%) were using hormonal contraception,

236

and four women became pregnant during the trial. Short course metronidazole/tinidazole use for

237

other indications during the intervention period was evenly distributed among randomization

238

groups (Table S2: n=1-3 per group; p=0.688), as was short course use of other oral antibiotics

239

(Table S2: n=2-4 per group; p=0.781). Furthermore, these other antibiotics did not impact

240

lactobacilli and BV-anaerobes concentrations significantly (Table S2, Figure S2). No antifungals

241

were used. Most women were adherent with their study product >90% of the time, but this

242

percentage was non-significantly lower in the GynLP group (68.8%) than in the metronidazole

243

(82.4%; Fisher’s exact p=0.438) and EF+ groups (88.2%, Fisher’s exact p=0.225; Table S3).

244
245

VMB compositions at baseline

246

By design, all randomized women at screening had BV (by Nugent and/or Amsel criteria) and/or

247

TV (by wet mount and/or culture): 82.4% had BV alone, 14.7% had BV and TV, and 2.9% had

248

TV alone. Therefore, as expected, most women had dysbiotic VMB types by 16S rRNA gene

249

sequencing at screening: BV_GV (41.8%), LA (17.9%), BV_noGV (11.9%), GV (11.9%), and

250

PB (1.5%). However, 14.9% had a lactobacilli-dominated Li VMB type, of whom 60% were TV-

251

negative, and these women would not have needed metronidazole treatment. Also by design, all

252

randomized women were BV-negative (by Amsel criteria) and TV-negative (by wet mount and

253

culture) at the time of randomization. However, almost half of the women (44.8%) were not

254

lactobacilli-dominated by sequencing at the time of randomization, and none of them were L.

255

crispatus-dominated (which is considered the most optimal VMB state): their VMB types were

256

Li (52.2%), Lo (3.0%), LA (26.9%), PB (9.0%), GV (6.0%), and BV_GV (3.0%) (Table 1).

257
258

At randomization, the mean total bacterial concentration ranged from 5.54-6.34 log10 cells/μl in

259

the four randomization groups, and these ranges were 5.22-5.97 for lactobacilli, 3.36-5.62 for

260

BV-anaerobes, 1.34-2.36 for pathobionts, and 0.57-2.20 for ‘other bacteria’ (Table S4; relative

compositions of the four groups: the concentrations total bacteria and BV-anaerobes were higher

264

in the GynLP group than the control group (Mann Whitney U test p<0.05), and the BV-anaerobes

265

concentration (p<0.01) and Simpson diversity (p<0.05) were lower in the EF+ group than the

266

control group (Table 1).

267
268

Variables that were associated with at least one VMB composition variable in unadjusted mixed

269

effects models (Table S6) included currently using hormonal contraception or being pregnant

270

(associated with a higher pathobionts concentration), above-average sexual risk taking based on

271

reported numbers of partners and condom use (higher pathobionts concentration), aged 30 years

272

or older (lower BV-anaerobes and pathobionts concentrations), and managing menses with a

273

sanitary pad compared to other methods (higher Nugent score). Reporting current urogenital

274

symptoms was also associated with VMB composition but this likely represents reverse

275

causality. We could not exclude women with ongoing chlamydia and/or gonorrhea infections at

276

randomization because the turn-around time of diagnostic testing was slow, but the VMB

277

compositions after metronidazole treatment of women with and without ongoing chlamydia

278

and/or gonorrhea infection were similar (Figure S2). As mentioned earlier, short course antibiotic

279

use that was not part of the study interventions was not associated with VMB composition either

280

(Tables S2 and S6; Figure S2).

one woman in the EF+ group for malaria during pregnancy. Both events occurred after the

286

intervention period and both women recovered completely. Two women reported non-serious

287

social harms that were judged related to study participation. One woman in the control group was

288

beaten by her partner because she engaged in self-sampling; she withdrew from self-sampling

289

but continued participation in the study. One woman in the GynLP group suffered verbal

290

harassment from her partner and her sister for taking part in the study and elected to withdraw.

291
292

During the intervention period, urogenital symptoms were reported by 13.4% of participants

293

(genital itching, burning, and pain during sex but no vaginal discharge) with no differences

294

between groups, and only two speculum exam and no bimanual exam findings were reported by

295

the physician (Table 2). After product cessation, urogenital symptom reporting was similar

296

compared to the intervention period (10.8%), but the number of speculum exam findings

297

increased (32.8%), likely reflecting the high urogenital infection incidence in this cohort. A total

298

of 41 adverse events were spontaneously reported between enrollment and M6. All of them were

299

judged definitely not or unlikely to be related to trial participation, and they were evenly

300

distributed among groups.

Preliminary efficacy: microscopy endpoints

303

In modified ITT analyses, the BV incidence rate by Nugent score during the intervention period

304

was 10.18 per person-year at risk (PY) in the control group, and lower in the metronidazole

305

(1.41/PY; p=0.004), EF+ (3.58/PY; p=0.043), and GynLP groups (5.36/PY; p=0.220) (Table 3).

306

Mean Nugent scores during the intervention period were highest in the control group, lowest in

307

the metronidazole group, and in-between in the two vaginal probiotics groups (Figure 2A). By

308

the end of the intervention period, many women had developed microbiological-BV without

309

symptoms. In line with standard practice, they were not treated, but they were also no longer

310

included in the ‘person-years at risk’ denominator because they had already developed the

311

endpoint. BV incidence rates were therefore much lower (1.26/PY overall) after cessation of the

312

intervention, and similar between groups. The results for BV incidence by modified Amsel

313

criteria were similar to those for Nugent scores (Table 3), and no vulvovaginal candidiasis was

314

diagnosed after randomization.

315
316

Preliminary efficacy: sequencing endpoints

317

We took the baseline VMB composition imbalances into account by not only showing bacterial

318

group means at each visit but also mean differences with enrollment (Figure 2 and Table S4 for

319

concentrations, and Figure S3 and Table S5 for relative abundances), and by using mixed effects

320

models including participant identification number as the random effect to determine if any

321

changes were statistically significant (Table 4). Immediately after BV treatment completion, the

322

VMBs of most women gradually worsened (lactobacilli declined and BV-anaerobes expanded)

323

due to the high-risk nature of the cohort. The mean lactobacilli concentration declined to a low of

324

3.86 log10 cells/μl at M2 in the control group, but less so in the intervention groups (ranging from

325

4.60-5.58 log10 cells/μl at follow-up visits). In unadjusted mixed effects models using data from

326

the intervention period only, metronidazole users had a higher lactobacilli concentration

327

(p=0.043) and relative abundance (p=0.006) than controls, EF+ users had a higher relative

328

abundance (p=0.014) but not concentration than controls, and GynLP users had trends in the

329

same directions that were not statistically significant. The expansion of BV-anaerobes was

330

significantly lower in oral metronidazole users (relative abundance; p=0.023), and in EF+ users

331

(concentration; p=0.041), compared to controls. Mean pathobionts concentrations were low in all

332

groups throughout, ranging from 1.61-3.35 log10 cells/μl at follow-up visits. Mixed effects

333

models did not identify any significant associations between randomization groups and

334

pathobionts concentrations or relative abundances, but showed trends (0.05<p<0.1) towards

335

lower pathobionts relative abundances in the two vaginal probiotics groups compared to controls

336

(Table 4). Mean concentrations of ‘other bacteria’ were also low throughout, but highest in the

337

EF+ group at the D7 and M1 visits (EF+ contains a Bifidobacterium strain). This was significant

338

in unadjusted mixed effects models for relative abundances (p=0.023) but not concentrations.

339
340

The proportions of women in each group at each visit having a particular VMB type

341

corresponded with the concentration and relative abundance data, and additionally showed that –

342

in lactobacilli-dominated women – the Li VMB type was far more common than the Lcr and Lo

343

VMB types throughout (Figure S4). Among women with dysbiosis, the LA and BV_GV VMB

344

types continued to be the most common dysbiosis types during follow-up. In unadjusted mixed

345

effects models using intervention period data only, metronidazole users and EF+ users, each

346

compared to controls, were significantly less likely to have dysbiotic VMB types (BV_GV,

347

BV_noGV, and GV combined; p=0.012 and p=0.029, respectively) (Table 4).

348
349

The associations in unadjusted mixed effects models persisted after adjustment for hormonal

350

contraception use/pregnancy, sexual risk taking, and age, except for the association with

351

Lactobacillus concentration among metronidazole users. Metronidazole users compared to

352

controls had a significantly higher Lactobacillus relative abundance (p=0.014), a significantly

353

lower BV-associated bacteria relative abundance (p=0.049), and were significantly less likely to

354

have BV by Nugent scoring (p=0.031) or by VMB types (BV_GV, BV_noGV, and GV

combined; p=0.017) (Table 4). EF+ users compared to controls had a significantly higher

360

Detection of probiotic strains

361

During the intervention period, relevant probiotic strains were detected in 39% of samples from

362

EF+ users and 20% of samples from GynLP users (all swabs combined, including self-sampled

363

swabs). The detection percentages were 58% and 31%, respectively, in sensitivity analyses using

364

non-rarefied data. Some of the EF+ strains cannot be differentiated from naturally occurring

365

strains, and EF+-like strains were therefore detected (at low levels) in all groups at most time

366

points (Figure 3, Table S4). However, the mean concentrations were highest in the EF+ group

367

during the intervention period (mean concentrations 0.48-1.92 log10 cells/μl per visit for all

368

women combined, and 3.62-4.28 log10 cells/μl per visit for women who did have EF+ strains

369

detected using rarefied data). The GynLP strain was only detected in the GynLP group during the

370

intervention period (mean concentrations 0.25-1.05 log10 cells/μl per visit for all women

371

combined, and 3.72-4.55 log10 cells/μl per visit for women who did have GynLP detected using

372

rarefied data). Inter- and intra-individual differences between participants were high: the highest

373

vaginal probiotic concentration detected in an individual EF+ user was 5.51 log10 cells/μl, and in

374

an individual GynLP user was 6.17 log10 cells/μl. During the intervention period, the mean

375

relative abundances of the probiotic strains were 0.03 in both EF+ and GynLP users, and 0.08

376

and 0.15, respectively, if only samples in which any strains were detected were included.

377
378

VMB transitions

another were common. As expected, most transitions during the intervention period were from

381

Lactobacillus-dominated states to dysbiotic states, but the reverse also occurred. Transitions

382

between VMB types were common in all randomization groups. The percentage of actual

383

transitions divided by potential transitions between D7 and M6 were 29/66 (43.9%) in the

384

control group, 32/64 (50.0%) in the metronidazole group, 28/67 (41.8%) in the EF+ group and

385

24/56 (42.9%) in the GynLP group (Fisher’s exact p=0.792).

386
387

Incidence of sexually transmitted and urinary tract infections

388

As expected, the incidences of HIV (n=2), herpes simplex type 2 (n=1), syphilis (n=1),

389

gonorrhea (n=5), chlamydia (n=6), TV (n=5) and urinary tract infection (n=7) were too low to

390

determine differences between randomization groups (Table S7).

391
392

DISCUSSION

393

This trial showed that all three interventions were safe. Our preliminary efficacy results confirm

394

that intermittent use of metronidazole reduces BV recurrence10–12, and suggest that intermittent

395

use of lactobacilli-containing vaginal probiotics may also reduce BV recurrence. We also found

396

that vaginal probiotic use is acceptable and feasible in African settings (to be reported

397

elsewhere). These findings are important because many women and clinicians would prefer safe

398

and efficacious vaginal probiotics to metronidazole as they are not expected to negatively affect

399

other body niche microbiotas or cause antimicrobial resistance, and may have fewer side effects.

400
401

Our trial was funded as a pilot study and therefore had a modest sample size. Despite this, many

402

of the preliminary efficacy associations for intermittent metronidazole and EF+ use reached

403

statistical significance. While this was not the case for intermittent GynLP use, all of the trends

404

in this group were in the same directions. We believe that the GynLP group suffered a few

405

disadvantages compared to the other randomization groups, which may explain the lack of

406

statistical significance. Randomization imbalances commonly occur in small trials36, and in our

407

trial, this led to women in the GynLP group being more dysbiotic at baseline than controls. We

408

ameliorated this disadvantage in our analysis strategy, but we may not have been able to

409

eradicate it. In addition, GynLP users were less adherent on average than metronidazole and EF+

410

users. Differences in adherence using triangulated data did not reach statistical significance, but

411

probiotic strain detection rates (58% for EF+ samples and 31% for GynLP samples using non-

412

rarefied data) support this claim. Biose has since simplified the dosing regimen of next

413

generation Gynophilus products to two fixed days a week to boost adherence. Finally, GynLP

414

dosing (once every four days) was similar to metronidazole dosing (twice weekly) but less

415

frequent than EF+ dosing (once per day for the first five days followed by thrice weekly for the

416

remainder of the intervention period).

417
418

Probiotic detection rates were 58% for EF+ samples and 31% for GynLP samples, and inter- and

419

intra-individual variabilities were high (with probiotic concentrations ranging from zero to 6.17

420

log10 cells/μl). This detection variability is consistent with most other vaginal probiotic studies

421

that used sampling at non-daily intervals and molecular assessment methods21,37–39. A major

422

drawback of all of those studies, including ours, is that product use was not directly observed but

423

self-reported, and precise information about the time period between last product insertion and

424

sample collection was lacking. The average total bacterial load of a healthy vagina is currently

425

not known40. The average vaginal surface area was estimated to be 87.5 cm41. One Dacron swab

426

head in this study absorbed about 106/μL bacteria. If we assume that one swab head absorbs on

427

average 200 μL42, and that this covers about one cm2 of a total of about 100 cm2 vaginal surface,

428

the total bacterial load in the vagina would be in the order of 2x1010 bacteria. The vaginal

429

probiotic strain(s) in our trial were both applied at about 1.5x109 CFU per dose, which would be

430

about 7.5% of the total vaginal load after application if all probiotic bacteria were to remain in

431

the vagina. We detected mean relative abundances of 7.7% for EF+ strains and 15.1% for GynLP

432

when only samples with any relevant probiotic strains detected during product use were included

433

(thereby eliminating any potential non-adherence). A recently published study of Gynophilus

434

Slow Release tablet (which is almost identical to GynLP) in which women self-sampled every

435

day showed that mean vaginal concentrations of Lcr35 by qPCR were between 104 and 106

436

CFU/μl in women who used the tablet once every four or five days43. Using our estimated

437

concentration data, we detected a similar concentration range in samples with any GynLP

438

detected. This consistency is reassuring, but the question remains whether probiotic

439

concentrations of this order of magnitude optimally prevent BV recurrence in the long-term.

440

Furthermore, all studies referenced in this paragraph, including ours, have shown that probiotic

441

strains do not persist in the vagina after dosing has ceased. The second question then is whether

442

the colonization capacity of probiotic bacteria should be improved. Our data suggest that

443

probiotic lactobacilli may boost ‘natural’ lactobacilli indirectly, which may be sufficient. Indirect

444

effects may include increased localized lactic acid production, modulation of cervicovaginal

445

mucosal immune responses, and/or inhibition of biofilm formation, by probiotic bacteria3,44,45.

446
447

Additional limitations of our study include the high urogenital infection risk of this cohort

448

(which makes prevention more challenging), and our inability to fully control for potential

449

confounders. However, the mixed effects models were controlled for some of the best known

450

VMB determinants (hormonal contraception, pregnancy, sexual risk taking, and age)1,46–48. We

451

were not able to exclude women with gonorrhea and/or chlamydia infection at the time of

452

randomization due to the slow laboratory turn-around time, but the VMB compositions of

453

women with and without infection were similar, and we therefore think that this did not

454

negatively affect our results.

455
456

With the development of better genomic and culturing methods, we are now on the cusp of a new

457

era in vaginal probiotic research. Past vaginal probiotic studies have shown mixed results13–24,

458

but almost all of these studies used imprecise VMB assessments based on clinical symptoms and

459

microscopy. The addition of sequencing methods showed that many more women than

460

previously thought are not lactobacilli-dominated after standard antibiotic BV treatment, that

461

host responses to antibiotic and probiotic treatment are highly variable, and that it is possible to

462

differentiate between probiotic strains and ‘natural’ lactobacilli. Furthermore, others have shown

463

that quantifying relative abundance data in the same manner as we have done in this study

464

correlates well with species-specific quantitative PCRs of non-minority species33,34. This then

465

allows for microbiota data reduction into quantitative variables that can be analyzed in mixed

466

effects models that adjust for repeated measures and confounding. We recommend that future

467

trials incorporate these or other rigorous methods, optimize dosing and timing of product

468

insertion versus sample collection, and enroll women with various urogenital risk profiles.

469

Ideally, these trials would also evaluate the effects of interventions on vaginal biofilm formation,

470

and – eventually – the impact on pregnancy complications, HIV epidemics, and other adverse

471

outcomes.

Figure 1. Flow diagram of numbers of women seen and study procedures at each visit

Abbreviations: BV, bacterial vaginosis; D7, day 7 visit; M1/2/6, month 1/2/6 visit; RU, Rinda Ubuzima; STI, sexually transmitted infection;
TV, Trichomonas vaginalis; UTI, urinary tract infection. *Totals to 110 reasons among 102 women because there could be more than one
reason per woman. †No speculum exam performed; molecular testing of self-sampled vaginal swabs. ‡Reasons: outside of metronidazole
treatment window (n=5), enrollment target already met (n=4), has a mental disorder (n=1), did not complete screening procedures and was
subsequently lost to follow=up (n=1), withdrew consent during the Screening visit because she thought the reimbursement was too low
(n=1). §Three women in each randomization group were selected for self-sampling every other day during the first month of follow-up.
¶Reasons: moved away from Kigali (n=2), lost interest because symptoms resolved (n=1), and was verbally harassed by partner and sister
about study participation (n=1).
