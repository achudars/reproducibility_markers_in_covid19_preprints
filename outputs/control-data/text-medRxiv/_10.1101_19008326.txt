Abstract
Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a common problem globally. Current evidence suggests that
maladaptive modulation of central pain pathways is associated with pain chronicity following
e.g. chronic post-operative pain after knee replacement. Other factors such as low mood,
anxiety and tendency to catastrophize seem to also be important contributors. We aimed to
identify a chronic pain brain signature that discriminates chronic pain from pain-free
conditions using cerebral blood flow (CBF) measures, and explore how this signature relates
to the chronic pain experience. In 44 chronic knee pain patients and 29 pain-free controls, we
acquired CBF data (using arterial spin labelling) and T1-weighted images. Participants
completed a series of questionnaires related to affective processes, and pressure and cuff
algometry to assess pain sensitization. Two factor scores were extracted from these scores
representing negative affect and pain sensitization, respectively. A spatial covariance
principal components analysis of CBF identified five components that significantly
discriminated chronic pain patients from controls, with the unified network achieving 0.83
discriminatory accuracy (area under the curve). In chronic knee pain, significant patterns of
relative hypo-perfusion were evident in anterior regions of the default mode and salience
network hubs, while hyperperfusion was seen in posterior default mode regions, the
thalamus, and sensory regions. One component was positively correlated to the pain
sensitization score (r=.43, p=.006), suggesting that this CBF pattern reflects the neural
activity changes encoding pain sensitization. Here, we report the first chronic knee painrelated brain signature, pointing to a brain signature underpinning the central aspects of pain
sensitisation.

Introduction
Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a common public health, social and economic problem [32]
with prevalence rates between 20 – 44% in the UK and US [11,13]. Unfortunately, as much
as 40% of people living with chronic pain report unsatisfactory effect of treatment [7],
highlighting a clear and urgent need to better understand chronic pain mechanisms for
developing better treatments.
Recent work has focused on identifying specific neural signatures to explain the varied
processes that contribute to the experience of physical pain [39], but relatively little progress
has been made to unravel the neural basis of the chronic pain experience. Cerebral blood flow
(CBF) as measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) is particularly well-suited to study
chronic pain, as it allows the capture of an absolute measure of non-evoked brain activity that
underlies a “tonic” state such as ongoing spontaneous pain. To date, few CBF studies have
investigated chronic pain, with even fewer studies in musculoskeletal (MSK) pain
[10,19,21,40,41]. Observations of CBF changes in chronic MSK pain [19,40,41] are not
consistent and are often limited by small sample sizes (N

≤ 17 pain patients). One recent

study using a slightly larger sample (N=26 patients), did not observe any CBF differences
between osteoarthritis patients and healthy controls, though did observe an association
between ongoing pain and regional CBF in areas predominantly involved in emotional and
fear regulation [10]. Most of these studies employ either voxel-wise or region-of-interest
(ROI) methods which are known to lack the sensitivity to capture effects that may be more
subtle and spatially distributed.
Multivariate analysis of CBF data provides a data-driven way to extract latent features of
ongoing coordinated brain activity even from multiple parallel processes. This approach may
allow the decoding of these processes and determine which markers distinguish patients with
chronic pain from those without pain; a similar approach has been applied to distinguish
patients with and without Parkinson’s disease [28]. Recently, a Gaussian Process classifier
was applied to CBF data to discriminate pre- and post-surgical molar extraction intervention
with just under 95% accuracy [29], demonstrating that certain CBF features are associated
with acute severe pain in a clinical setting. To extend this further toward clinically relevant
chronic pain, we aimed to identify novel discriminating markers of chronic pain in a
population of largely community-dwelling people with mild-moderate knee pain, and explore
how these features relate to specific facets of the chronic pain experience.

The purposes of this study were to use a multivariate approach (principal components
analysis) to: i) discriminate patients with chronic knee pain from pain-free controls using
non-evoked brain activity measures, and ii) determine whether these differences in CBF
covariance patterns are related to affective or sensitized pain mechanisms in the pain
syndrome. We hypothesized that the discriminatory components would comprise the classic
pain connectome (insula, cingulate cortex) and extended pain networks including affective,
sensory and arousal networks. Additionally, we hypothesized that these CBF patterns would
differentially correlate with pain sensitization and affective pain phenotypes.

Materials and methods
Design and participants
This was a cross-sectional nested study within a larger knee OA multidimensional
phenotyping study (INCOPE, Imaging Neural Correlates of Osteoarthritis Phenotypes) that
will be reported in a future manuscript. For this CBF sub-study, the initial batch of the full
INCOPE dataset comprising 54 patients with chronic knee pain and 33 healthy and pain-free
participants was included (from a total dataset of 87 patients with chronic knee pain and 39
healthy and pain-free participants), allowing a reasonably matched group of patients and
pain-free controls to test our multivariate approach on CBF data. Recruitment pathways were
from a database of participants from the community via the East Midlands based Knee Pain
and Related Health in the Community (KPIC) study cohort (Nottingham Research Ethics

[NCT02098070]) [14,15] (N=53), primary care via general practitioner surgeries (N=27)
within the Nottinghamshire region, or secondary care via the Sherwood Forest Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust orthopaedic referrals or poster advertisements at Nottingham City
Hospital (N=7). All participants completed a set of questionnaires, quantitative sensory
testing (QST), followed by an MRI session. The study was approved by the Nottingham
Research Ethics Committee 2 (NREC reference: 10/H0408/115) and all participants provided
written informed consent. Inclusion criteria for patients was self-reported diagnosis of knee
osteoarthritis and/or reported chronic pain in the knee (i.e. pain for most of the day and pain
for >14 days/month), and their knee pain was their most troublesome pain. Healthy
participants reported no current or past history of knee pain (nor pain elsewhere). Participants
were excluded if they had any history of stroke or had any current major neurological
condition, psychosis, or had a contraindication to MRI (full list of inclusion and exclusion
criteria is provided in the supplementary materials).

Psychometric data
Participants all underwent psychometric assessments before the MRI scan session. Pain
intensity on the day was taken in the hour prior to scanning using a numerical rating scale
(NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain). Questionnaires included the
Beck’s Depression Inventory II [6] (BDI-II), the Trait anxiety scale of the State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory (STAI-T) [36] and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale [37], which was broken down
into the subscales of helplessness, magnification and rumination. The BDI-II and the STAI-T
were converted using Rasch conversion following the method of Lincoln et al [25], which
recommended the BDI-II to be divided into two subscales (negative thoughts and negative
behaviours) for measuring depression in patients with osteoarthritis.

Quantitative Sensory Testing
All participants underwent quantitative sensory testing before the MRI scan session which
consisted of pressure algometry (pressure pain thresholds, PPTs) using a handheld pressure
algometer with a 1-cm2 probe and pressure was increased at a rate of approximately 30 kPa/s
(Somedic AB, Sösdala, Sweden), and cuff pressure algometry using a computer-controlled
cuff algometer (Cortex Technology and Aalborg University, Denmark). The pressure
algometry assessed PPTs at two sites: the sternum and the most painful knee (or either knee
in pain-free healthy controls). The cuff pressure algometry assessed pressure pain detection
threshold (PDT), pressure pain tolerance threshold (PTT), temporal summation of pain (TS)
and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) using the same method as described in previous
studies [31,33,38]. Detailed methods of the quantitative sensory testing is provided in the
supplementary materials.

MRI Data acquisition
Participants underwent multimodal MRI at 3T (Discovery MR750, GE Healthcare) using a
32-channel head coil, as part of a larger phenotyping study (INCOPE) including arterial spin
labelling [ASL] data and T1-weighted anatomical data used for image registration which are
reported here for the CBF pattern sub-study. Cerebral blood flow was assessed using a
pulsed-continuous ASL sequence with 3D spiral read-out (Tag/Control image pairs=72, Flip
angle = 111°, TE=10.536ms, TR=4844ms, labelling duration=1450ms, post-labelling

resolution=1.875x1.875x4mm) [12]. ASL imaging also utilised background suppression and
an M0 image for image quantification in line with current recommendations [2]. High
resolution anatomical images were acquired in the sagittal plane using a fast spoiled gradient
echo (FSPGR) sequence (TE/TR=3.164/8.132ms, TI=450ms, slice gap=1mm, field of
view=256, matrix=256x256, flip angle=12°, voxel resolution=1mm3). T1-weighted images
were acquired parallel to the AC-PC line whilst the bottom of the acquired ASL image was
positioned just below the cerebellum to allow whole-brain CBF imaging.

Image preprocessing
Each image was visually assessed for quality including artefacts induced by motion, and poor
labelling defined by extremely low CBF values in the occipital regions (<20ml/100g/minute)
relative to the rest of the cortex. Following quality control, there were 10 patients and 4
healthy control datasets excluded from the final analysis resulting in a total of 44 patients and
29 healthy and pain-free control subjects. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps (ml/100 g/min)
were produced with the use of an automatic reconstruction script as reported in Zaharchuk et
al [42]. Both the T1-weighted images and CBF maps were first skull-stripped using the brain
extraction tool from FSL v5.0.11 (FMRIB Software Library). The CBF maps were then
linearly registered to the T1-weighted images and then to MNI-space using FLIRT v6.0
(FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool) [20]. The images were then spatially smoothed
using a 5 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel and masked to exclude voxels that
had a probability of less than 42% grey matter. This was chosen as it provided the most
reliable CBF measures in an independent test-retest dataset (unpublished). These masked
images were then used in the PCA analysis.

Principal Components Analysis of CBF data
A voxel-based principal components analysis was used to generate patterns of spatial
covariance in grey matter perfusion across the sample. We followed the method of Spetsieris
et al [35] and Melzer et al [28] whereby the data was log-transformed and demeaned using
the subject’s mean perfusion and the group mean, and then entered in a principal component
analysis to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance. The spatial images
of principal components with unit variance were generated using the same approach as it was
proposed previously [28]. As a result, the first 16 components were selected, which explained
87.8% of the variance, with the first component captured the most variance, and the last
component accounts the least. A backward stepwise binomial logistic regression was used to

determine the components which successfully distinguished pain patients and pain-free
controls (based on Akaike Information Criterion). These components were then linearly
combined to create a unified network representing a chronic knee pain-related perfusion
network and z-scored.

Region of interest analysis
To validate the PCA findings, we also applied a region of interest analysis to determine
whether the patterns of hyper- and hypo-perfusion were reflected in absolute CBF changes.
The positive and negative loadings (thresholded at z>1.96 and z<-1.96 respectively) of the
unified network and component 12 (the one component of 16 correlating with QST factor
score) were masked onto each subject’s CBF map to extract mean CBF values. Age, sex and
mean global CBF were regressed out of the absolute CBF data and all subsequent analyses
were applied to the residuals. For the behavioural measures, both age and sex were regressed
out of the data. Mean CBF of the unified network and component 12 were then compared
between the two groups. In addition, the component 12 positive and negative loading CBF
means for patients were correlated with the QST factor score to explore whether the
relationship was driven by hyper- or hypoperfusion.

Statistical Analyses
We performed the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett’s test of sphericity to ensure that a
factor analysis was suitable for dimension reduction of both the psychometric and QST
scores. This dimension reduction approach allows the integration of numerous variables
gathered from psychometric questionnaire scores and QST scores to provide measures
reflecting an overall measure of negative affect and sensitisation, respectively. Unrotated
principal components analysis was used to extract a principal component for the
psychometric scales and the QST scores using SPSS v25.0.0.1. These factor scores were used
to relate to CBF measures. Linear regression was used to relate the network scores of the
patient group with NRS pain severity score, affect factor score and QST factor score,
correcting for age and sex. To test for the network reliability, a 500 permutation bootstrap
estimation method was employed using the same approach as Melzer et al [28]. A z threshold
of 1.96 was used to determine voxels that were considered reliable. For the ROI analyses of
absolute CBF, age, sex and mean global CBF were regressed out of the data and all
subsequent analyses were applied to the residuals. For the behavioural measures, both age
and sex were regressed out of the data. Mean CBF comparisons between groups was carried
out using an independents samples t-test. All analyses used an α level of p<.05.

A binomial generalised linear model was used to predict the labels of patients with chronic
knee pain and healthy controls using each CBF component alone as well as the unified
network and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was analysed to
assess the performance of the prediction. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver
operating characteristic were obtained using Matlab 2018a for all the individual components
and the unified network.

significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity (p<.0001) indicated that a factor analysis was suitable
for dimension reduction of the BDI-II subscales, STAI-T and the PCS subscale scores. The
extracted principal component explained 68.7% of the variance. This component loaded
positively on all scores with maximum loading for PCS helplessness, where higher factor

QST data
Between groups comparisons revealed a significantly lower PDT of the affected leg and
reduced CPM in patients (Table 1). There was also a trend toward greater sensitivity in
patients for the PPT of the knee and PTT of the affected leg (p<0.1, Table 1). A total of 8
scores were derived from the QST (PPT of sternum and knee, PDT and PTT of each leg, TS
and CPM). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test (0.65) and Bartlett’s test of sphericity (p<.0001)
indicated suitability of a factor analysis for dimension reduction of the QST scores. The
extracted component explained 54.5% of the total variance which loaded positively and
highly on all measures indicating greater pain sensitivity (maximum ipsilateral pain tolerance
threshold) except for the TS, where high scores indicate greater sensitivity resulting in
negative loading albeit of much smaller extent (Table 3).

Principal components of CBF data
The PCA extracted 16 components that were used for predicting group classification.
Components 2, 6, 8, 12 and 13 significantly classified knee pain patients from controls. These
components explained 19.9%, 2.2%, 1.3%, 1% and 0.9% of the variance respectively and
were considered to be knee pain-related components. The area under the curve (AUC) of the
unified network was 0.83 while the five included individual components yielded 0.62-0.64
classification power. The unified network achieved 82% specificity and 76% sensitivity. The
unified component and component 12 are illustrated in Figure 1a and 1b respectively, with
details of cluster regions (clusters > 20 voxels) listed in Table 4.

Of the five discriminatory components, only component 12 was significantly associated with
the QST factor score (r=.43, p=.006). The affect factor score was not significantly correlated
with any of the knee pain-related components. Correlation between the discriminating
components and the individual QST and affect measures can be found in the supplementary
materials. Pain severity did not significantly correlate with any of the five discriminatory
components.

Region of interest analysis
Unified network: Mean CBF was significantly higher in patients with knee pain (M=50.23,
SEM=0.48) compared with healthy controls (M=47.01, SEM=0.54) within the knee painrelated perfusion network with positive loadings (t(71)=4.38, p<.001, Fig. 1c), and
significantly lower CBF (knee pain patients: M=47.93, SEM=0.43; pain-free controls:
M=50.49, SEM=0.43) within the regions with negative loadings (t(71)=-4.02, p<.001, Fig.
1c), confirming that the positive and negative loadings reflect hyper- and hypoperfusion
respectively. Conversely, mean CBF outside of the pain-related network (i.e. grey matter
regions that did not reach the threshold for positive or negative loadings) did not differ
between chronic knee pain and pain-free participants (knee pain patients: M=48.94,
SEM=0.02; pain-free controls: M=48.97, SEM=0.02).
Component 12: Clusters from component 12 with positive and negative factor loading
showed significant hyperperfusion (t(71)=3.26, p=.002), and hypoperfusion (t(71)=-2.36,
p=.02) in pain patients versus controls. Within the patient group absolute CBF averaged over
the networks of component 12 showed a significant positive association with the QST factor
for the positive regions (r=.423, p=.005) but no significant association for the negative
regions (r=-.224, ns). These results are illustrated in Figure 1d. A closer inspection of this
CBF correlation was carried out to explore the correlation with individual QST measures
which showed an association with all measures except for TS (these results are provided in
the supplementary materials).
In addition, as the chronic pain signature did not include the PAG as expected [9,19,22], we
undertook

a regional PAG posthoc analysis to mitigate against the risk that the PCA

dimensionality reduction may fail to detect small clusters forming local networks. As shown
in the supplementary results, mean PAG CBF suggested hyperperfusion in patients compared
with controls.

Discussion
Using PCA of CBF data, the first clinical pain signature was derived from non-evoked brain
activity in chronic knee pain patients compared with pain-free controls. The discriminating
knee pain-related network revealed a covariance pattern of hypo-/hyperperfusion within
extended pain connectome regions. A component of the hyperperfusion network was related
to the degree of pain sensitisation pointing to a brain signature underpinning the central
aspects of pain sensitisation.

Knee-pain related network and its link to sensitisation measures
The ability of CBF covariance maps to clearly discriminate between chronic pain and painfree groups highlights the dual advantage of combining a multivariate pattern approach with a
quantitative physiological measure of brain activity as previously exploited for acute pain
[29]. There is however, evidence demonstrating spatial correlation between network hubs
measured via fMRI and CBF [24] allowing comparisons across modalities, albeit with
caution. The knee pain-related network corresponds well with regions considered part of the
pain connectome from resting-state fMRI, with a distinct pattern of increased perfusion in
posterior DMN regions and reduced perfusion in salience network regions. Previous studies
commonly report dysfunctions of regions comprising both the DMN and salience network in
various chronic pain conditions and across a range of imaging modalities [3,4,8,19,23,27]. In
one study using CBF data to discriminate pre- and post-surgical third molar extraction, the
multivariate pattern of perfusion classifying post-surgical painful state [29] is in striking
contrast to the current unified component classifying chronic knee pain patients. They
showed increased CBF post-surgery in the thalamus, salience network, secondary
somatosensory, and anterior cingulate cortices, with decreased CBF in visual and parietal
cortices. This dissociative pattern between our knee pain patients with mild ongoing pain and
the post-surgery patients with severe acute pain from O’Muircheartaigh et al.’s study, thus
largely excludes upregulated nociception as underlying mechanism, and conversely suggests
a maladaptive neuroplasticity process linked to pain chronification.
The observed CBF pattern of chronic pain showed however an overlap with the acute
postsurgical pain CBF signature reported in O’Muircheartaigh et al., with both displaying
increased CBF of the thalamus. It is tempting to speculate that persistent thalamic activation
may be a key process in driving pain chronification. In fact, thalamic volume changes have
been observed in patients with chronic hip OA pain, moreover, this effect is normalised
following successful arthroplasty intervention [17]. In our data, the dorsomedial nucleus was
specifically observed to be hyperperfused in patients and this was seen across the unified
components map as well as the component that showed a correlation with QST measures.
This nucleus is part of the medial pain pathway that is responsible for the affectivemotivational elements of pain perception, and moreover has extensive connections with the
cortex including somatosensory and limbic regions [1], akin to those regions we observed to
be hypoperfused in patients with chronic knee pain. The association between one of the
discriminating components with the QST score aligns well with the notion that aberrancies

within this network are more pronounced in those who are more centrally sensitised to pain.
The continuous nociceptive barrage may result in a sensitised state of the thalamic circuitry
that links to numerous areas of higher-order cognitive processes [1]. This cascading effect of
the overactive thalamus may explain the lack of deactivation of posterior DMN regions in our
patients and perhaps extend to affect other sensory (visual) regions. The reverse pattern
observed in the aforementioned acute post-surgical pain study [29] may be a demonstration
of the normal function of this thalamic circuitry to effectively up- and down-regulate salience
and default mode regions respectively during an acute pain experience. In contrast, in chronic
knee pain patients, continuous peripheral input may have resulted in a breakdown of this
system leading to dysfunctional bottom-up processes and an abnormal interaction between
salience and default mode networks. This constant peripheral pain drive has previously been
proposed to maintain sensitization of central pain pathways in MSK pain [16].
Kucyi et al. [22] found that spontaneous mind-wandering away from pain resulted in
increases in DMN activity with greater salience network activity when attending to pain. This
is consistent with the present findings of increased and decreased perfusion in the DMN and
salience regions respectively in patients who had lower sensitivity to pain. The higher activity
of the posterior cingulate, precuneus and cuneus regions in less sensitised patients may allow
these patients being better able to assess and appropriately orient attention toward and/or
away from pain. We speculate that the greater effectiveness of this system may have enabled
patients to become better adapted to cope with frequent nociceptive input, and thus
preventing central sensitisation. The deactivation of regions such as the insula and ACC may
be reflective of hypoarousal and a lesser ability for interoception. There may be a complex
interplay between the salience and default mode networks that results in an impaired capacity
to effectively disengage their attention to pain. Although purely speculative, this difference in
the ability to attend to or disengage from pain may determine the reorganisation of one’s
brain circuitry during the chronification and central sensitisation process.

Changes in the periaqueductal grey in chronic knee pain
It is however, surprising that the PAG was not evident as a pain-relevant region in our cohort
given previous reports of PAG changes in chronic pain [9,18,19,22,34] and its welldocumented involvement in the antinociceptive system for inhibition of pain [5,26,30]. One
might expect this region to robustly differentiate chronic knee pain patients from pain-free
controls, and furthermore be related to sensitisation of central pain mechanisms, particularly
if our theory above regarding the attending toward/away from pain is true. However, the

spatial resolution that is feasible with ASL does not allow the segregation of the
subcomponents of the PAG and therefore the signal measured from the PAG will be an
average across both the ascending and descending pain pathways which are known to have
distinct connections and mechanisms underlying the pain experience [26]. Furthermore, small
clusters are less likely to be detected using a PCA approach due to the thresholds applied for
explained variance. A posthoc exploratory analysis of the PAG in our dataset revealed that,
similarly to a previous report [19], there is indeed increased perfusion in patients with chronic
knee pain (supplementary figure 1), suggesting that although there are PAG alterations in
chronic knee pain, the PAG perfusion pattern may not contribute to the major CBF networks
derived via the PCA approach across the full dataset. It would be of interest to further
investigate in the same individuals whether there is a link between CBF increases of the PAG
(as seen in the current study) and altered connectivity of the PAG with default mode regions
(as seen in [22]).

Negative affect in chronic knee pain
The lack of association between the affective score and CBF is not unexpected. Although our
patient cohort was significantly higher scoring for affective elements, they would still be
considered to be within the healthy range for levels of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the
present dataset may lack the variation in affective features to be able to effectively test our
hypothesis. We also suggest that the PCA approach be applied to a patient group (ideally with
high variation of affective measures) to identify components that differentiate patients with
high and low negative affective features in order to better deconstruct the effect of
psychological aspects contributing to chronic pain. In addition, the natural next step is to
validate this model using an independent dataset to test the predictive confidence and
generalisability.

Limitations
A limitation of our study is that a proportion of our patients had taken opioid medication
and/or antidepressants which could have affected CBF especially within the salience and
default mode regions. However, comparison of the mean CBF values of both the positive and
negative loadings of the unified component between those on opioid or antidepressant
medication and those who were not, showed no significant difference (see supplementary
materials for detailed results). Moreover, visual inspection of the correlation between the
QST factor score and both the component 12 network score and the mean CBF of component
12 positive loadings did not show a systematic pattern to suggest there was a strong impact of

medication on the current findings (colour-coded correlation plot of Fig 1d is available in the
supplementary materials).

Conclusions
This study successfully delineated patients with chronic knee pain from controls using a PCA
approach on CBF data, and the discrimination was related to the degree of pain sensitisation
as measured via comprehensive quantitative sensory testing methods. The patterns of CBF
alterations indicate greater blood flow changes in primarily the salience and default mode
network regions commonly implicated in chronic pain, and these were further heightened in
those with greater central sensitisation. This pattern was unrelated to the pain severity on the
day and largely opposite to the reported CBF signature of acute postsurgical pain further
pointing to a neuroplastic, and also a potentially non-nociceptive origin. We demonstrate that
task-free CBF assessment contains important covariance features that may signify the neural
mechanisms of pain chronification and pain sensitisation.
