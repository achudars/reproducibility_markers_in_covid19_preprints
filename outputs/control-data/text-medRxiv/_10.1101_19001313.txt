Abstract

25

Background

26

Science studies have been a field of research for different knowledge areas and they have

27

been successfully used to analyse the construction of scientific knowledge, practice and

28

dissemination. In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded scientific

29

production worldwide analysing international collaboration and the knowledge landscape

30

through time, research topics and country involvement.

31

Methodology

32

We searched the Web of Science (WoS) for studies published up to 31st December 2018

33

on Zika using the search terms “zika”, “zkv” or “zikv”. We analysed the scientific production

34

regarding which countries have published the most, on which topics, as well as country level

35

collaboration.

36

knowledge mapping and the scientific research path over time and space.

37

Findings

We performed a scientometric analysis of research on Zika focusing on

38

We found two well defined research areas divided into three subtopics accounting for six

39

clusters. With regard to country analysis, the USA followed by Brazil were the leading countries

40

in publications on Zika. China entered as a new player focusing on specific research areas. When

41

we took into consideration the epidemics and reported cases, Brazil and France were the leading

42

research countries on related topics. As for international collaboration, the USA followed by

43

England and France stand out as the main hubs.

44

public health related topics from 2015 until the very beginning of 2016, followed by an increase

45

in topics related to the clinical aspects of the disease in 2016 and the beginnings of laboratorial

46

research in 2017/2018.

47

Conclusions

48

Mapping the response to Zika, a public health emergency, demonstrated a clear pattern of

49

the participation of countries in the scientific advances. The pattern of knowledge production

50

found in this study represented the different perspectives and interests of countries based firstly

51

on their level of exposure to the epidemic and secondly on their financial positions with regard to

52

science.

53

Introduction

54

Zika virus infection (ZVI) was first reported in humans in 1954, but only in 2007 did the

55

first outbreak occur in Micronesia [1, 2], and several small outbreaks in Micronesia and the

56

Pacific Islands have been reported since then. However, it was only in 2013 that ZVI started

57

revealing its epidemic potential [3]. In 2015, the virus was linked with associated neurological

58

disorders, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, microcephaly and yet unknown neurological

59

disorders in newborns [4, 5]. It was and remains an event of scientific uncertainties.

60

In February 2016, mostly driven by the Brazilian Zika-associated microcephaly cases,

61

WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Different research

62

groups all over the world, as part of separate and collaborative research networks, made a

63

concerted effort to understand the various factors required to cope with the epidemic, including

64

the Zika virus infection, transmission and control, as well as the social impact of severe forms of

65

the disease in the most affected societies [3]. During the outbreak, especially after WHO PHEIC,

66

international funding and fast-tracking procedures for publishing scientific outcomes stimulated

67

scientific research and publication. The increasing number of publications on Zika after 2015 has

68

been attributed mainly to its association with microcephaly [6], but by 2016, only a few core

69

journals had published on Zika [7].

70

Since the emergency declaration, science studies' applied to the Zika epidemics

71

publications has come mostly from focusing on scientific networks and their collaboration and

72

co-publication. Some researchers have adopted bibliometric and/or scientometric perspectives,

73

analysing papers and documents to discuss different aspects of scientific production in terms of

74

co-authorship, cooperative networks and innovative potentials on the Zika topic (see [7-10]).

75

Furthermore, the discussion about the influence and centrality of certain groups,

76

researchers and even countries have enriched the debate raised by scientometrics applied to Zika.

77

A first mapping of the scientific networks and their most influential researchers in Zika as a

78

theme was done in 2018 [11]. Using techniques of Social Network Analysis, the authors mapped

79

the co-authorship networks on Zika papers published in 2015 and 2016. The study revealed that,

80

besides the number of publications, two other factors might be connected to explain the

81

prominence of a given researcher in these scientific networks: the diversity of partnerships and

82

the established connections with the pioneers in the field.

83

Another interesting perspective is to address the role of specific regions on the matter.

84

Zika-related publications and patents, investigated from a scientometric perspective, highlighted

85

the strategic role played by the Latin America and Caribbean research network in terms of

86

addressing the science and technology (S&T) challenges related to the outbreak [12]. According

87

to this study, Brazil itself stands out in reporting and researching the clinical manifestations of

88

the ZVI and also in studies about vector control, the latter related to the filing of patents in

89

particular.

90

State of the art considered, these studies are central to the systematisation of current

91

knowledge in terms of which research areas have been most developed so far. This scenario

92

allows, for instance, policy managers to contribute by allocating and prioritising research to the

93

current prevention and epidemiological combat of the Zika virus. It is also essential to identify

94

interaction and collaboration among countries to help further the development of shared

95

governance in Zika and other research-related fields and increase scientific production and

96

knowledge in the area. Regarding neglected populations and diseases, these studies can support

97

further analysis on equity and sustainability, and science production between low and middle-

98

income countries and developed countries, during and after health emergencies.

99

In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded scientific

100

production worldwide analysing international collaboration and the knowledge landscape

101

through time, research topics and country involvement. Therefore, this study explores how the

102

epidemic of Zika has translated into research all over the world and over time, identifying what

103

the main thematic areas of scientific development on Zika are. We also explore how the S&T

104

apparatus of each country responded to the Zika emergency, from the first studies until 2018 and

105

according to knowledge areas.

Materials and methods

107

Data collection, treatment and cleaning

108

Our dataset was obtained by searching terms related to Zika virus infection (“zika” OR

109

“zkv” OR “zikv”) by Topic in Web of Science (WoS). We selected all the articles published

110

from 1945 to the end of December 2018. The search was performed on January 21st, 2019. From

111

the retrieved articles, we extracted the title and abstract to develop a knowledge map and used

112

the metadata variables regarding date published, authors and co-authors’ affiliation countries as

113

well as the ISI subject categories from WoS assigned to them [13].

114

The selected contents were downloaded as a text file containing all the results of our

115

query. The file was cleaned by (i) converting all words to lowercase, (ii) removing special

116

characters (e.g., “.”, “:” and “/”), and (iii) standardizing similar terms (e.g., “ae aegypti”, “aedes

117

aegypti”). Data cleaning was conducted in Python. The Python code used is available at GitHub

118

[14].

119

Data Analysis

120

We conducted two main analyses on the Zika publications retrieved. First, a descriptive

121

analysis to understand how countries collaborate towards Zika knowledge; and second, a textual

122

analysis of research on Zika using knowledge mapping over time and space (i.e., countries).

123

Descriptive analysis

124

The descriptive analysis was performed both directly by filtering information from Web

125

of Science homepage and by using VOSviewer software [15] to perform country collaboration

126

network analysis. To summarize data information for each research article, we extracted from

127

each author his institutional affiliation country. Articles produced by different institutions of the

128

same country were considered a national collaboration, and articles produced by authors

129

affiliated to institutions from more than one country were considered international

130

collaborations. After that, we constructed a co-authorship network at the country level using data

131

exported from VOSviewer and reconstructed and filtered using Gephi software for visualization

132

[16].

133

In order to measure collaboration in Zika publications, we deduced an international

134

collaboration index (ICI), which is the ratio of the number of countries that a given country

135

collaborated with, over the total number of countries (minus the country itself) which produced

136

results toward Zika knowledge. The closer the index is to one, the more collaborative the country

137

is, and the closer it is to zero, the less internationally collaborative the country is.

138

To address the issue of international collaboration over time as a proportion of published

139

articles, an international collaboration factor (ICF) was calculated as the number of articles with

140

author(s) affiliation from more than one country over the number of articles with author(s)

141

affiliation to just one country. As with the ICI, the more colaborative a country is, the closer it is

142

to one, the less collaborative, the closer it is to zero.

143

Textual analysis

144

We carried out a textual analysis to discover textual data relationships among extracted

145

words. The method reveals thematic trends and identifies publication subjects surrounding

146

specific topics or fields [17]. To do this, we analysed the titles and abstracts of the articles in our

147

sample. More specifically, we analysed words (also called terms or forms), extracted from the

148

titles and abstracts, grouped by text segments comprised of 40 terms each, and applied

149

Correspondence Factorial Analysis (CFA) to correlate them. The baseline assessment of research

150

areas into clusters relied on the clustering algorithm of IRAMuTeQ v7.2 (Interface for

151

Multidimensional Analysis of Texts and Questionnaires). The correlation process is obtained by

152

testing if the frequency of a given word is statistically associated with another using Pearson

153

Chi-square at a significance level of 5%. Based on the similarity, words are aggregated into

154

clusters of main areas of knowledge. Content analysis was also performed using IRAMuTeQ.

155

The defined number of clusters in IRAMuTeQ required empirical knowledge in the field

156

as well as several tests on how many clusters made a fair and accurate separation of knowledge

157

areas. Therefore, to validate our baseline clusters, we compared the number and content of each

158

cluster obtained using IRAMuTeQ with those obtained using VOSviewer. Moreover, we used

159

the categories defined by WoS for each article, based on the journal in which it was published to

160

further evaluate if the clusterisation process and defined sub-areas of research were aligned.

161

Finally, we showed the results to a panel of specialists on Zika and public health.

162

After we had established statistically significant knowledge area clusters, we evaluated

163

which knowledge areas emerged over time, and stratified them into four groups by publication

164

year: <=2015, 2016, 2017 or 2018; second, we evaluated the participation in each cluster/field of

165

the top 10 countries with regard to the number of publications.

166

Results

167

Descriptive analysis on the countries collaborations

168

The collected data yielded a total of 3,454 articles produced by 18,453 authors, associated

169

with institutions from 150 countries. These articles were published with and without

172

Fig 1. Number of publications by International Collaboration Index for each of the top ten

173

countries. The graph is a dispersion matrix, the y axis is the number of publications on a

174

logarithmic scale base 2 starting at 100 publications and the ICI is on the x axis starting at 0.3.

175

The size of the circles is related to the number of publications and the intensity of the color from

176

dark red to light pink is related to the ICI as shown on the right side scale.

177

According to Fig 1 The most internationally collaborative countries were the USA (ICI =

178

0.67), followed by France (ICI = 0.57), England (ICI = 0.55), Germany (ICI = 0.47) and Brazil

179

(ICI = 0.45). The remaining most productive countries, Italy, India, Australia, China and Canada,

180

presented international collaboration indexes of 0.41, 0.40, 0.35, 0.32 and 0.31, respectively.

181

When we take into consideration the ICI with the number of publications we can see that the

182

USA has the highest ICI and number of publications placing it in the top right corner of the

183

graph. In contrast, China, the third country with the highest number of publications, is the ninth

184

in ICI in the bottom left corner of the graph. Brazil seems to occupy an intermediate position

185

regarding the number of collaborating countries and the number of publications, with the second

186

largest number of publications on Zika, and the fourth in ICI. France and England seems to be

187

well positioned in terms of the number of collaborating countries. The remaining five countries

188

have fewer than 200 publications and show a similar ratio between the logarithmic number of

189

publications and the number of countries with which they have collaborated.

190

Table 1 summarizes the overall information about international collaborations for the ten

191

most productive countries. The countries that published the most on Zika during the study period

192

were the USA and Brazil followed by China, France and England.

The column with the total number of articles and the percentage in Table 1 accounts for

more than the total number of articles on Zika due to the collaboration amongst these countries.

201

With regard to the articles written by authors from one country alone and with collaboration we

202

can see that the only country with fewer than half of its articles being the result of collaboration

203

is the USA, in contrast with England, which has published almost double that of the USA, with

204

84.78%. The other three European countries, France, Germany and Italy, also shows higher

205

percentages compared to other non European countries.

206

In order to see how international collaboration among the top 10 publishing countries

207

occurred over time, in Fig 2 we plotted the yearly evolution of their international collaboration

factor - ICF (the number of articles produced with international collaborations over the total

209

production) until 2018 combining papers before 2015 all together. We can see a clear pattern in

210

the USA, Brazil, China and Australia, where the countries have a balanced level of production

211

with and without international collaboration. As a contrast, we can see that England, Germany

212

and France published articles in international collaborations at a higher frequency. Nonetheless,

213

the yearly ICF of the ten most productive countries together with the ICF for Zika publication

214

and WoS overall publication are considered in Fig 2.

215

Fig 2. The production evolution of the top 10 countries plus the overall Zika Production

216

and WoS production. The closer the dots are to 0.5 (highlighted by the black line), the articles

217

produced with collaborations are proportional to the articles produced without collaborations.

218

The value corresponding to the year 2015 represents the sum of all work produced by the

219

selected country up until 2015. Points on the zero line correspond to publications that had no

220

international collaboration. The size of the dots for Global WoS articles are divided by 1,000 in

221

order to fit the scale.

222

Using co-authorship networks between countries, we see that the majority (61.89%) of

223

the articles were produced within one country, 24.17% were collaborations between two

224

countries, 8.88% between three countries and 2.51% between four countries. The remaining

225

2.55% were collaborations between five or more countries. Interestingly, we also found that

226

international collaborations were present on average in 64.47% of articles produced by the top 10

227

countries. The reason for this apparent discrepancy has to do with the fact that an international

228

paper will be considered a collaboration for every country represented in that paper but only

229

once when comparing articles with and without international collaboration.

230

Analysing country-level collaboration, as shown in Table 1 England has the highest

231

number of publications that resulted from international collaboration (84.78%), followed by Italy

(75.58%) and Germany (74.58%). Another collaboration analysis which supports the results for

233

Table 1 and Fig 2 is presented in Fig 3 with an international collaboration network graph. This

234

figure presents all the collaborations amongst the top ten countries.

235

Fig 3: Collaborations among the 10 most productive countries. Each node corresponds to a

236

country and the size of the node is related to the number of international collaborations they have

237

within that group. The thickness of the lines represents the number of collaborations between any

238

two countries and an aproximation of those numbers are presented by the box on the top right.

239

The color scheme emphasizes link differences between countries since the color of a line is a mix

240

of the color of the nodes it connects. The node distribution on the figure has been chosen only to

241

facilitate visualization. The two countries with the fewest number of publications are positioned

242

at the center of the graph and the most productive to the least from top to bottom and left to right.

243

The USA is in the first position in terms of absolute numbers of publications. In contrast,

244

it occupies the 10th position (42.84%) in terms of the percentage of articles produced with

245

international collaboration. Despite being in 10th position, the number of articles that the USA

246

published with international collaboration corresponds to more than three times the total number

247

of articles published by England, the country with the highest international collaboration ratio.

248

Out of the 958 articles published by the USA with international collaboration, over 15% were

249

with Brazil and nearly 10% with China. This strength of collaboration is shown in Fig 3 by the

250

thickness of the line between the nodes.

251

Out of the 299 Brazilian studies published as results of international collaboration, over

252

60% were with the USA, followed by nearly 20% with England and 10% with both France and

253

Germany. For the 147 Chinese studies published with international collaboration, over 75% were

254

with the USA and a few articles with other countries. (Fig 3).

Main research areas of knowledge

256

A total of 24,685 words were analyzed inside 21,055 text segments, of which 17,525

257

were considered active words (i.e., verbs, nouns and adjectives). Using IRAMuTeQ, six clusters

258

were identified and named according to the most frequent words. Cluster 1 represented the

259

“Clinical Aspects” of the disease (13.8% of the words); Cluster 2 the “Diagnosis” (10.6%);

260

Cluster 3 included the “Epidemiology” of the disease (20.1%); Cluster 4 the “Entomology”

261

(14.5%); Cluster 5 “Cellular Biology” (19.9%); and Cluster 6 "Molecular Biology" (21%) (Fig

Fig 4. Dendrogram of the clusters obtained with IRAMuTeQ. The dendrogram is divided

264

into 6 clusters formed by branch divisions. The first branch divides Group A, and Group B.

265

Group A is further divided into two subgroups called Group A1 and Group A2. The size of each

266

bar corresponds to the number of words in that cluster directly related to the percentage value in

267

the bottom right corner of each bar. The associated name for each cluster appears on its bar, and

268

the colour scheme has been chosen to facilitate visualization. In front of each bar, there is a

269

square word cloud of words with the highest chi-square value to aid the understanding and the

270

representation of each cluster.

271

Using the WoS subject categories, 165 of 252 possible categories were present in the

272

studied articles, and each article is classified in one or more category. To compare WoS

273

categories with the clusters defined using Iramuteq, we used the following approach. First, we

274

selected the ten most frequent categories presented in our studied articles. Second, we analysed if

275

the most significant categories for each one of the 6 clusters independently appeared with a high

276

frequency or not. By doing this, we were able to better classify the clusters by the words which

277

appeared in them.

278

The ten most frequent categories were: Infectious Diseases; Public Environmental

279

Occupational Health; Tropical Medicine; Virology; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Microbiology;

280

Parasitology; Immunology; Biochemistry Molecular Biology; and Medicine General Internal.

281

Other six categories, among the 10% most frequent, which were not included in the top ten list

282

but were significant to categorize the clusters were: Entomology; Cell Biology; Health Policy

283

and Services; Clinical Neurology; Pediatrics; and Diagnosis. Based on these sixteen categories,

284

we found the following results for Group A: Public Environmental Occupational Health category

285

was well defined in the “Epidemiology” cluster (cluster 3). The clusters "Diagnosis" and

286

"Entomology" (clusters 2 and 4) shared some of the same categories such as Infectious Diseases

287

and Tropical Medicine, with a difference for the Parasitology category which appeared in cluster

288

4 but not in 2. Furthermore, Diagnosis category was in cluster 2 and Entomology category in

289

cluster 4; each cluster was named after these categories. Cluster 1 “Clinical Aspects” had none of

290

the top 10 high-frequency categories of WoS in it. However, it included less frequent categories

291

such as Clinical Neurology and Pediatrics.

292

In Group B, with clusters "Cellular Biology" and "Molecular Biology" (cluster 5 and 6),

293

there were similarities in Virology and Microbiology as main categories. The main difference

294

was that in cluster 6, the most common category was Immunology, and in cluster 2 Virology

295

with Multidisciplinary Sciences were some of the areas. The category Cell Biology was included

296

in cluster 5 which was named after it. Similarly, the category Biochemistry Molecular Biology

297

was very evident in cluster 6.

298

After the validation of the clusters by the categories and their representations, we asked a

299

total of 12 specialists to evaluate the clustering results and the nomenclature. All responses were

300

positive in considering the clusters a well-defined set of research sub-areas within the field of

301

Zika taking into consideration the words available and the categories. Spatial distribution of the

302

words coloured according to the cluster was presented to the specialists with the inferred

303

nomenclature and positive responses were received.

307

for the articles represented by the clusters. The size of each word represents their chi-square

Year and Country distribution by cluster

311

Another scientometric analysis, after the construction of the knowledge map and the

312

validation of the clusters, concerns the global research path of science over time, based on the

313

year of publication of the articles. Because a large number of papers were published from 2016

314

onward we decided to group all publications before and including 2015 together. These

315

accounted for 3.2%. The publications of our sample yielded four groups (<=2015, 2016, 2017

316

and 2018). We carried out this investigation in the same way as we did with the subject

317

categories, by evaluating how statistically relevant a specific time group were in one or more of

318

the six clusters.

319

We incorporated the findings into Fig 5 with the boxes and using tilde (~) in front of the

320

year to emphasise the fact that the results are an approximation. This means that a particular

321

cluster might have publications or words in all year groups, although its prevalence is in a

322

particular quadrant position or year.

323

Similar to the subject categories, the year of publication analysis presented a well-defined

324

pattern. Publications before and up to 2015 were most prevalent in the bottom right part of the

325

figure with entomology research and related words in years before 2015 and regarding public

326

health in 2015 and 2016. Publications in 2015 showed a higher than expected presence, by

327

analysing the chi-square, for clusters 3 "Epidemiology" and cluster 2 "Diagnosis". For

328

"Diagnosis", the production surged between 2015 and 2016 the period at the start of the

329

epidemics. The top right quadrant has publications from 2015 to 2016 mostly, where the clusters

330

"Diagnosis" and "Clinical Aspects" are present. In broad terms, epidemiology is defined as the

331

study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified

332

populations in order to characterise and determine associations between exposures and outcomes

333

[18]. Taking into account that 2015 through 2016 was the most critical period due to knowledge

334

gaps related to the infection, the three remaining areas in Group A - clinical aspects, diagnosis

335

and entomology - are key factors to be studied in order to better understand epidemiology.

336

Furthermore, entomology is related to the need for a public health quick response during an

337

emergency.

338

In the left part of Fig 5, the clusters from Group B can be seen for both years 2017 on top

339

and 2018 on the bottom. Each year is well established in those quadrants and aligned with the

340

areas of research and clusters "Cellular Biology" and "Molecular Biology" respectively. Taking

341

into consideration the areas with lower than expected values for chi-square for these years,

342

cluster 4 "Entomology" is lower in 2017 and cluster 1 "Clinical Aspects" is lower for 2018,

343

which shows a significant shift in research topics from previous areas to new areas.

344

Finally, we performed a country analysis for the clusters with the top ten countries

345

regarding the number of publications. Fig 6 shows the Chi (not squared) results in order to

346

capture the negative values (lower than expected) for the countries participating in a cluster. The

347

higher or lower than expected results could be interpreted as the amount of research above or

348

below average, represented on the text analysis, carried out by each country. If a country’s

349

research distribution to a particular cluster is close to zero, the percentage of articles expected for

350

that cluster follows the overall trend. If the number of articles is above or below the percentage

351

expected for that cluster, a bar will appear considering how far from the expected value they are.

352

If a country shows a particular concentration in a cluster, it should show a lower than

353

expected in one or more clusters. From Fig 6, we can infer the presence of a country as well as

354

its contribution to research on the topic or area.

355

Fig 6. Chi values for the top 10 countries for each cluster. The results are calculated taking

356

the observed value (number of text segments) within a cluster minus the expected value for that

357

cluster and country divided by the square root of the expected value. This is the Chi value (not

358

squared) to show negative (or less than expected) values. For each cluster (1 through 6) we have

359

all ten countries and their respective chi value.

360

Starting with the most productive, the USA has a high presence with statistical relevance

361

in cluster 6 focusing on "Cellular Biology". Although the USA has a presence in all the 6

362

clusters, due to its high number of publications and collaborations, the most significant presence,

363

statistically speaking, is in cluster 6 and its least significant presence in cluster 1 "Clinical

364

Aspects" and 4 "Entomology". Brazil, the country with the second highest scientific production

365

is most significant in cluster 1 regarding "Clinical Aspects" of the disease, while it is almost

366

absent in "Cellular Biology" (cluster 5). China is present in two clusters mainly, "Cellular

367

Biology" (cluster 5) and "Molecular Biology" (cluster 6) along with the USA. Clusters 1 through

368

4 are of very little statistical relevance for China. France is present in clusters 1, 2 and 4 playing

369

a role as an important research centre for public health but focusing on the disease as well since

370

French Polynesia had been one of the first places to show endemic signs of the virus. About

371

England, while a non endemic country, its important presence in cluster 3 “Epidemiology”

might be related to the fact that it is home to one of the largest centre for tropical and neglected

Discussion

377

In this study, one of the first analyses on Zika publication that has taken into

378

consideration international collaborations, we have attempted to understand the scientific

379

research path towards Zika science production. The unexpected appearance of the virus in an

380

epidemic form and with devastating effects on pregnancy was followed by the rapid growth of

381

scientific research on ZVI with a great inflow of research capital and institutional interests. It

382

makes research into Zika scientific production at the international context a compelling case in

383

international health and biomedical research perspectives, given its unique characteristics.

384

In general, collaborations in science occur through the need for complementary resources

385

among different actors, institutions and countries, such as knowledge and skills, financial

386

resources and access to the field and key actors in order to conduct relevant research. Co-

387

authorship studies indicate that more connected actors tend to attract a higher number of

388

connections over time [19], an aspect that amplifies learning capacities and the absorption of

389

knowledge. This study shows how ZVI related-science has evolved since 2015, as a result of the

390

interest of an international research community focused on solving new and challenging research

391

questions, related to a recognized worldwide health problem.

392

The appearance of ZVI in its epidemic form in the Americas in 2015, particularly in

393

Brazil, initially triggered epidemiological field studies. In 2016, when the outbreak was declared

394

an international public health emergency, the science related to ZVI was intensified in endemic

395

and non-endemic countries. The evolution of the study field over a short period evolved from

396

epidemiology and entomology to cover clinical and diagnostic aspects of the virus.

397

Subsequently, laboratory-based studies took over, with an emphasis on molecular and cellular

398

biology. This process has mobilized scientific efforts and resources from different countries,

399

institutions and research teams from different scientific areas. In a very short time, complex

400

interactions among these teams from different scientific areas have taken place. An analysis of

401

articles published on this subject in this period provides important insights into our

402

understanding of the path of the scientific response to ZVI.

403

The strong collaboration between the USA and countries from different continents (e.g.,

404

Brazil, Canada, Germany and Australia), showed that the USA is the main contributor in terms

405

of collaboration and suggests its key research capacity in the field. Among the possible reasons

406

why the USA is found to be such a prominent publication country as well as a central player in

407

terms of international collaboration in Zika, might be the fact that it is the top R&D funder for

408

neglected diseases [20]. Furthermore, this country has considerable knowledge accumulation in

409

tropical diseases, including the Department of Defence, which has been one of the main

410

supporters of scientific research in this area [21,22].

411

By using the International Collaboration Index (ICI) and the International Collaboration

412

Factor (ICF), we were able to examine the influence of the countries by taking into consideration

413

the number of countries they have contributed with and their ratio of international collaboration

414

over time. The most collaborative countries in relative terms are in Europe. The high levels of

415

the international collaboration of England may be explained by the significant recent investment

416

made available by the British government and philanthropic funding agencies for the research

417

community aiming to respond to the challenges posed by ZVI [23]. The same can be said for the
18

418

European Union, which counts on four large research consortia (ZikaPlan, ZikAction,

419

ZikAlliance and ZikaVax) coordinated by European organizations in association with research

420

institutions from different regions across the world [24].

421

Also, the potential threat of a Zika epidemic could partially explain the increased country

422

collaboration over time. When the first case of Zika virus infection was confirmed in the

423

Northeast region of Brazil, in May 2015, an epidemiological alert by the Pan American Health

424

Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) was released. The alert recommended

425

Member States to establish and maintain a capacity for ZVI detection, clinical management and

426

an effective public communication strategy [25]. In November 2015, Brazil declared ZVI a

427

national public health emergency and three months later, the World Health Organization

428

declared it a PHEIC [26]. We suggest that a causal effect between the alert/emergency and the

429

increased number of collaborations took place during this period considering the knowledge gaps

430

in understanding ZVI.

431

Brazil is a country with a vast scientific literature on dengue virus transmission, among

432

other arboviruses. However, the results indicate that it had carried out almost no research on Zika

433

virus before the start of the epidemic. Most of the entomological studies had taken place in

434

countries such as Italy, India and Australia. The scarce research resources for research and the

435

virtual inexistence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere until 2014 could justify this finding.

436

One of the first steps for health surveillance is to take the kind of disease into

437

consideration. In this sense, research into the clinical aspects of Zika helps in the characterization

438

of the disease. At the end of 2015, Zika infection and especially microcephaly appeared as a new

439

problem to be tackled. Questions regarding the clinical aspects and the epidemiology were the

440

main focus at this moment. Physicians might argue: "What is the Diagnosis?", "What are the
19

441

physical pathological mechanisms of the virus/disease?", "What is the case definition?", putting

442

the focus on physiopathology.

443

These questions boosted basic science, since research on the clinical aspects and

444

epidemiology depends basically on people and methods, while applied science builds upon

445

cellular and molecular biology, depending on expensive equipment and other technologies and

446

qualifications. This scenario gives an academic advantage to countries with a higher

447

technological density. We saw Cluster 1 "Clinical Aspects" in 2016 being superseded by Clusters

448

5 and 6 ("Cellular Biology" and "Molecular Biology") in the following years. It also gives clues

449

to understanding the dominant participation of countries such as the USA and China in the

450

clusters related to cellular and molecular biology.

451

Nevertheless, these results have some limitations as our source of information was the

452

Web of Science, which could have excluded articles not indexed in this database. All in all, this

453

study, with its strengths and limitations, shows that science has values, interests and practical

454

applications. The fulfilling of the research objectives are thus strategic in the sense that it could

455

aid the dissemination of research, appropriation and the use of the knowledge produced within

456

the framework of scientific research to support strategies for the control and prevention of the

457

ZVI.

458

However, in the Global Health arena, it is known that inequities in science and

459

technology among high and low and middle-income countries area default in the historical

460

trajectory. Since the Zika outbreak, Brazil has played an important and essential role in

461

developing research and publishing about ZVI and its repercussions. However, regarding ZVI

462

scientific production, we can ask how sustainable the Brazilian prominence in time is. Until

463

when will Brazil be an almost mandatory partner to develop research and publishing on this

464

matter? How to improve more equitable and sustainable scientific production in the so-called

465

"Global South"? Challenging questions yet to be considered in further studies.

466

Conclusions

467

In this study, we have demonstrated that the scientific global research path in response to

468

the public health emergency of ZVI can be traced with data from indexed articles. It shows the

469

value of the study of scientific networks to help to understand science production in response to a

470

PHEIC. As soon as the public health emergency of ZVI started, our findings showed a first phase

471

of the scientific inquiry focused on entomological and epidemiological studies. It was followed

472

by a second phase with a dominance of studies on the diagnosis and clinical aspects of the ZVI,

473

and by a third and fourth phase focused on molecular and cellular biology. We also found that

474

Brazil has played an important role not only in the rapid response to the epidemic but also in the

475

capacity to produce research and to evoke international collaboration within a short period with

476

high-income countries such as the USA and England.
