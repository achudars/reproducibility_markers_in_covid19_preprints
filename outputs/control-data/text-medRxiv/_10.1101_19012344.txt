ABSTRACT
Background:
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been recommended as primary prevention of HPV-related
cancers for over 10 years in the United States, and evidence reveals decreased incidence of HPV
infections following vaccination. However, concerns have been raised that HPV vaccines could
decrease fertility. This study examined the relationship between HPV immunization and self-reported
infertility in a nationally representative sample.

Methods:
Data from the 2013-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed to asses
likelihood of self-reported infertility among women aged 20 to 33, who were young enough to have
been offered HPV vaccines and old enough to have been queried about infertility (n=1,114). Two
logistic regression models, stratified by marital history, examined potential associations between HPV
vaccination and infertility. Model 1 assessed the likelihood of infertility among women who had never
been pregnant or whose pregnancies occurred prior to HPV vaccination. Model 2 accounted for the
possibility of latent and/or non-permanent post-vaccine infertility by including all women 20-33 years
old.

Results:
8.1% reported any infertility. Women who had ever been married and had received an HPV vaccine
were

less

likely to report infertility (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.57) in model 1. No other associations

between HPV and infertility were found.

Conclusion:
There was no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. These
results provide further evidence of HPV vaccine safety and should give providers confidence in
recommending HPV vaccination. Further research should explore protective effects of HPV vaccines on
female and male fertility.

What is already known on this subject?
Despite evidence that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, concerns persist regarding a purported link
between HPV vaccination and infertility. These concerns were refuted by a recent population-based
cohort study that found no association between the HPV vaccine and primary ovarian insufficiency.

What this study adds?
This study broadens the existing evidence by exploring possible associations between HPV vaccination
and any self-reported infertility. There was no evidence of infertility among women 20-33 years old
who received one or more doses of HPV vaccine. This result provides further evidence of HPV vaccine
safety, diminishing remaining concerns among clinicians and the public.

INTRODUCTION
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an extremely common sexually transmitted infection[1] and is

linked to cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers in females and oropharyngeal, anal,

and penile cancers in males.[2] The HPV vaccine has been recommended for adolescents and young

adults as primary prevention for HPV-related cancers for over 10 years,[3] and a recent Cochrane

review of 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that the vaccine is both effective and safe.[4]

While HPV vaccination rates are improving, they still lag behind other recommended adolescent

vaccines.[5] HPV vaccine rates fall victim to some of the same barriers that adversely impact uptake of

other vaccines – including access disparities, inadequate healthcare provider recommendations, and

poor vaccine knowledge and attitudes.[6] Other barriers appear unique to the HPV vaccine, which

prevents cancer-causing sexually transmitted infections. Notably, a number of studies have revealed

parental[7,8] and physician[9,10] anxieties about associations between the HPV vaccine and sexual

behavior, which are not supported by evidence.[11]

Recently, a small number of case reports[12,13] and anecdotes in the popular press[14,15]

have given rise to concerns that the HPV vaccine causes lowered fertility by inducing primary ovarian

insufficiency (POI). These concerns were refuted by a recent population-based cohort study of nearly

200,000 women that found no association between the HPV vaccine and POI.[16] However, POI is not

the only condition implicated in female infertility. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore

potential associations between HPV vaccination and infertility. We selected the National Health and

Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES[17]) as the data source for this inquiry as it provides nationally

representative data inclusive of individuals’ immunization and reproductive health histories. If females

vaccinated against HPV report higher rates of infertility than those not vaccinated, more specific

investigation of links between the HPV vaccine and conditions that cause infertility would be

warranted.

METHODS
NHANES has collected data to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in

the U.S. intermittently since 1960, and continuously since 1999. The survey utilizes a representative

sample of about 5,000 people living in various counties across the country. NHANES has long inquired

about reproductive health, including pregnancy. In 2007-2008, NHANES first included questions about

the HPV vaccine, and continues to do so. In 2013, the program began to include questions about

difficulty or inability to become pregnant. In order to investigate potential associations between HPV

vaccination and infertility, we analyzed data from two survey periods of the NHANES study: 2013-2014

(the first period that inquired about infertility) and 2015-2016 (the most recently available period). We

confined our sample to women between 20 and 33 years old (N=1114) for two reasons: 1) NHANES did

not query women younger than 20 if they had ever been pregnant; and 2) women older than 33 years

old at the time of the 2013-2014 period would not have received the HPV vaccine, which was

introduced in 2006. Because NHANES data are publicly available, this investigation was exempt from

Institutional Review Board procedures.

Outcome of interest: infertility
Difficulty or inability to become pregnant can be attributed to various factors, including age and

disease. Infertility is defined as a failure to become pregnant after 12 months of regular and

unprotected sexual intercourse.[18] Primary infertility occurs when a woman meets the definition of

infertility and has never been pregnant. Secondary infertility occurs when a woman has been pregnant

in the past, but is later unable to become pregnant.[19]

NHANES specifically asks female participants whether they are “pregnant

ever

they have “

now

?” and whether

been pregnant?“ with the specification that ever being pregnant includes a current

pregnancy, live births, miscarriages, stillbirths, tubal pregnancies, and abortions. While a history of

pregnancy suggests fertility, those who have never been pregnant are not necessarily infertile.

Therefore, we used the following question, introduced in the 2013-2014 period of NHANES data

collection, as a closer proxy for infertility:

[Has participant] ever attempted to become pregnant over a period of at least a year without

becoming pregnant? (yes/no)

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the HPV vaccine is a possible cause of

infertility. While the HPV vaccine is recommended prior to sexual activity and during an age-range

when most women or girls are not attempting to become pregnant, we account for both early

pregnancy and late-adopters of the vaccine. In our first analysis, we assess the likelihood of reporting a

12-month period of infertility among women 20-33 years old who have never been pregnant (primary

infertility), as well as women whose only pregnancies occurred prior to the age at which they received

a first dose of the HPV vaccine (post-vaccine infertility).

Similarly, if the HPV vaccine were related to infertility, it could be hypothesized that the effect

would be permanent, as would certainly be the case if the mechanism of infertility were POI; however,

the effect might also be shorter-term. The effect of the vaccine on fertility could also be either

immediate or delayed. To account for the possibility of latent and/or non-permanent, post-vaccine

infertility, we performed a second analysis of all women 20-33 years old who reported any 12-month

period of infertility, whether or not they had become pregnant at another time (i.e. primary or

secondary infertility).

Hypothesized predictor of infertility: any doses of HPV vaccine
As the main predictor variable, we used responses to the question,

[Has participant]

ever received one or more doses of the HPV vaccine?

This question has been asked of female NHANES participants between the ages of 9 and 59 since 2007.

Other factors
During the two periods analyzed for this study, NHANES tracked several other health factors

relevant to fertility, including body mass index (BMI), ever using birth control pills, and history of

several sexually transmitted infections (STI). For the following analyses, we created a binary variable

gauging whether an individual had any history of STI, based on self-report or laboratory results

included in NHANES, as demonstrated by Anyalechi and colleagues.[20] Other covariates were health

insurance status, routine access to healthcare, and socio-demographics, including age, race/ethnicity,

marriage, education, and income. In addition to controlling for the aforementioned factors, we

excluded women who reported having had their uterus or both ovaries removed, as both procedures

result in a loss of fertility.

While recurrent miscarriage is a distinct condition from infertility, it can be related to some of

the same underlying factors, and thus may be an important variable in the relationship between HPV

vaccine and infertility. Unfortunately, NHANES does not ask explicitly about miscarriages; however, we

attempted to account for miscarriage by controlling for history of live birth alongside history of

pregnancy in our analysis of women who report any infertility. In multivariable models, any prior

pregnancy and history of live birth were co-linear so only pregnancy history was retained in the final model.

Statistical analysis

We calculated descriptive statistics (i.e. percentages, means, and standard deviations) for self-

reported infertility, the receipt of HPV vaccination, and other factors. Survey weights provided by

NHANES were used to account for the complex sampling design and response rates and to generate

estimates at the population level. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to

examine the association between self-reported infertility and HPV vaccination status. Analyses were

stratified by marital status based on the assumption that women who have never been married may be

less likely to have attempted to become pregnant. All the regression models were adjusted for

sociodemographic characteristics and other health- and healthcare-related factors. Due to

multicollinearity between the history of prior pregnancy and live birth (see Table 1), the variable of the

history of live birth was excluded from the regression models. All analyses were conducted with the

software STATA/SE 14.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).

RESULTS
Overall, 8.1% of our sample reported having ever experienced a 12-month period of infertility.

The rate of primary infertility (i.e. among women who had never been pregnant) is 3.7%, and the rate

of secondary infertility (i.e. among women who had been pregnant in the past) is 12.0%. In general,

females who reported infertility during the past 12 months differed from their counterparts in several

ways. Those with a history of infertility were slightly older (27.8 years vs. 25.3 years; p<0.001), more

likely to be obese (57.4% vs. 32.1%; p <0.001) and more likely to have ever been married (p<0.001).

They also had a lower income-to-poverty ratio (2.1 vs. 2.6; p=0.019) and were less likely to have health

insurance (65.1% vs. 81.0%, p=0.001). Women who reported infertility had a higher rate of history of

past pregnancy (78.7% vs. 50.9%, p<0.001) and livebirth (78.7% vs. 50.8%, p<0.001), but were less

likely to have received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine (20.4% vs. 36.4%; p=0.02). See table 1.

Our first analysis included women with primary or post-vaccine infertility defined as women

who had never been pregnant, or who had not been pregnant since receiving the HPV vaccine and

reported a year of attempting pregnancy without success. Multivariable models indicate that there is

no association between HPV vaccination and infertility among women in this population who have

never been married (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.24-3.49), or for the overall sample (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.17-1.35).

Among women who had ever been married, those who had been vaccinated against HPV were less

likely to report infertility (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.57). BMI was the most significant predictor of

infertility in our model, with obese women nearly five times more likely to report infertility (OR 4.72,

95% CI 1.41-15.8) compared to women with underweight or normal BMI. Race also played a role, as

Black women were four times more likely to report infertility (OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.05-15.3) than White

women. Women with a college education (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.97) and women covered by health

insurance (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.67) were less likely than their counterparts to report infertility,

though health insurance coverage was not a significant predictor among never married women. Age,

income/poverty ratio, ever use of birth control pills, history of STI, and routine access to health care

were not individually associated with the likelihood of reporting infertility. See table 2.

Any infertility
When including all women between the ages of 20 and 33 in these two periods of the NHANES

sample, we did not find a significant relationship between HPV vaccination and infertility. In this

sample, women who had ever been married were more than twice as likely to report any 12-month

period of infertility as those who had not been married (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.28-3.89). After stratification

by marital status, we found that among never married women, those with higher incomes were less

likely to report infertility (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.95). No other variables were associated with infertility

in this subgroup. Married women with BMIs categorized as obese were more than twice as likely to

have experienced infertility (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.22-4.65), a pattern which persisted in the overall sample

(OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.20-3.53). Among married women, those covered by health insurance were less

DISCUSSION
In both analyses, the first focusing on women with possible primary or post-vaccine infertility

and the second attempting to take into account latent and/or non-permanent post-vaccine infertility

and controlling for history of pregnancy, there was a consistent inverse relationship between HPV

vaccination and self-reported infertility, although this association was only statistically significant

among ever married women in analysis 1. Importantly, the analyses were conducted with a proxy for

infertility that is nearly identical to how infertility is defined in clinical practice and controlled for

important covariates like ever using birth control. Obtaining null results using an outcome variable that

broadly defines infertility dispels concerns about association between HPV vaccination and infertility

due to POI or any other condition. This lack of association may help allay public concerns about vaccine

safety and bolster HPV vaccination rates. It should also help providers feel confident in making strong

recommendations for HPV vaccination for adolescent girls and boys.

The statistically significant relationships between infertility and other variables in our analyses

were largely expected. For example, the relationship between obesity and infertility, which was seen in

both analyses, is well supported by prior data.[21] It should also be no surprise that women who have

ever been married were more likely to report infertility (Table 3) as this population is presumably more

likely to be trying to have children. Similarly, women with insurance coverage were less likely to report

infertility than those without insurance in both samples analyzed (Tables 2 and 3), likely because this

group had better access to medical care. Interestingly, increased odds of reporting infertility among

Black women was seen in the first analysis (women who had never been pregnant, post-HPV

vaccination), but not the larger second analysis of women who had ever experienced a 12-month

period of fertility. Previous research has observed, but not explained, increased odds of infertility

among Black women when controlling for common risk factors.[22]

There are several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results of this

study. First, the sample size was limited because survey questions about infertility and HPV

immunization only coincided for two periods of the NHANES study (2013-2014 and 2015-2016).

Similarly, the upper age limit for inclusion in this study was 33 years, because women older than 33

during the 2013-2014 NHANES survey would not have been eligible for the HPV vaccine when it was

introduced in 2006.If possible, future research should include older women to explore the possibility of

very delayed impacts of the HPV vaccine on fertility.

Second, all variables were self-reported, including HPV vaccination status and inability to become

pregnant when desired. It is possible that questions of vaccination status in particular could be subject

to recall bias since the many vaccinations given throughout childhood and adolescents are easily

confused. However, previous research using self-reported receipt of =/> 1 dose of HPV vaccine

(NHANES question IMQ060) have compared respondents’ answers to medical records and have

documented 86%-87% sensitivity, 83%-87% specificity, and 70%-73% agreement.[23,24]

Among women without a history of infertility, the NHANES data did not allow us to distinguish

those who had been successful in their attempts to become pregnant from those who had never tried

to conceive. Another limitation was the inability to easily control for miscarriage, an important

covariate that could be associated with infertility. Because miscarriage was not explicitly measured by

NHANES, we were limited to a proxy constructed by comparing self-reported pregnancies and live

births.

While only one subgroup in these analyses showed a significantly lower rate of infertility among

those who had been vaccinated against HPV, ongoing research seeks to understand whether HPV

vaccines are actually protective of fertility. A recent systematic review of more than 100 peer-reviewed

articles published between 1994 and 2014 found that HPV infections were related to decreased

reproductive function in both males and females. The studies reviewed focused largely on the

association of HPV infection with semen parameters, failed

in vitro fertilization, and poor pregnancy

outcomes (e.g., miscarriage).[25] Given that the 9-valent HPV vaccine is 96% effective at preventing

HPV infections and related conditions,[3] it is reasonable to believe that those who are vaccinated will

have fewer fertility problems. Moreover, cancers and pre-cancers caused by HPV infection also restrict

fertility. For example, cervical cancer workup and treatment (e.g. cervical conization) can result in

cervical insufficiency, miscarriages, and preterm birth. Further research is needed to quantify the

benefits of HPV vaccination to both female and male fertility. In the meantime, healthcare providers

and patients can be reassured that there is no association between HPV vaccination and infertility.
