Abstract

Background
Multimorbidity is one of the principal challenges facing health systems worldwide. To help
understand the changes to services and policies that are required to deliver better care, we
used a novel approach to investigate which diseases co-occur and how combinations are
associated with mortality and service use.

Methods
Linked primary and secondary care electronic health records contributed by 382 general
practices in England to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) were used. The
study included a representative set of multimorbid adults (18 years old or more) with two or
more long-term conditions (N=113,211). A random set of 80% of the multimorbid patients
(N=90,571) were stratified by age and clustered using latent class analysis. Consistency
between obtained disease profiles, classification quality and associations with demographic
characteristics and primary outcomes (hospitalisation, polypharmacy and mortality) was
validated in the remaining 20% of multimorbid patients (N=22,640).

Findings
We identified twenty patient clusters across four age strata. The clusters with the highest
mortality comprised psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse (aged 18-64), coronary
heart disease, depression and pain (aged 65-84) and coronary heart disease, heart failure
and atrial fibrillation (aged 85+). The clusters with the highest service use coincided with
those with highest mortality for people aged over 65. For people aged 18-64, the cluster
with the highest service use comprised depression, anxiety and pain. The majority of 85+
year olds multimorbid patients belonged to the cluster with the lowest service use and
mortality for that age range. Pain featured in thirteen clusters.
Interpretation
This work has highlighted patterns of multimorbidity that have implications for health
services. These include the importance of psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse in
people under the age of 65; of co-morbid depression and coronary heart disease in people
aged 65-84, and of cardiovascular disease in people aged 85+.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the keyword list “multimorbidity, co-morbidity, disease patterns,
clusters, service use, long-term conditions, chronic conditions” for studies published in
English. We also reviewed multiple systematic reviews of multimorbidity patterns, and the
policy report of multimorbidity research issued by the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2018.
Most studies have focused on older populations (aged 60+) and often used a small list of
long-term conditions. Multimorbidity clusters composed of more than two conditions have not
been well profiled mostly due to non-representative and small samples. There is substantial
heterogeneity in the number of conditions considered (often less than 20) and in the
statistical methods. Most studies focused on grouping diseases rather than patients, making
it less straightforward to relate patients to outcomes in order to facilitate patient-centred care.
Added value of this study
This study is the first to describe and validate clusters of multimorbid patients across the
adult lifecourse using a patient-centred probabilistic clustering approach. This leads to a
more nuanced understanding of the relationship between age, multimorbidity and mortality
and new insights into the importance of different clusters. For example, contrary to perceived
wisdom, we show that the majority of 85+ year old multimorbid patients belong to a cluster
with relatively low service use and mortality for that age group. We identify a cluster of
younger multimorbid patients with psychoactive substance misuse that have a mortality rate
18 times higher than their non-multimorbid peers.
Implications of all the available evidence
We have validated and added to the list of disease combinations where tailored approaches
could be attempted to better manage multimorbid patients and develop effective
interventions. For example, the high mortality of younger multimorbid patients with
psychoactive substance misuse might be reduced by addressing risk factors (e.g. drug use,
smoking, deprivation) which are amenable to intervention.

Introduction
As a result of improved life expectancy and ageing populations, a growing number of
individuals are living with multimorbidity, i.e. more than one long-term condition1,2.
Multimorbidity has been recognised as a global challenge for health care management3 and
it is estimated by the Health Foundation that 14 million individuals in England have
multimorbidity, with over a third of these having more than four long-term conditions4.
Patients with multimorbidity also account for the majority of primary care consultations and
hospitalisations in the UK5. However, current clinical specialities, guidelines, quality
improvement strategies and quality of care metrics are organised around single diseases1
and treatments of multiple conditions are rarely coordinated, resulting in insufficient or even
conflicting care6.
Patients with multimorbidity have a diverse range of diseases, needs and outcomes4,5,7.
Identifying and characterising groups of multimorbid patients that share similar patterns of
long-term conditions might facilitate an improvement in their healthcare. For example, such
an approach might aid the development of effective strategies for early diagnosis and
prevention of multimorbidity, and allow for a better design and delivery of targeted
interventions1,8. Several systematic reviews have found common multimorbidity clusters
involving cardiovascular-metabolic conditions, mental health and musculoskeletal
disorders9,10.However, existing evidence has important limitations. Most previous studies
have focused on older populations (aged 60+); few have provided age-stratified clusters9–11,
leaving scarce evidence for the younger multimorbid population. Second, multimorbidity
clusters composed of more than two conditions have not been well profiled mostly due to
non-representative and smaller samples1,9,10. Third, there is substantial heterogeneity in the
number of conditions considered (often less than 20) and in the statistical methods. Most
studies focused on grouping diseases rather than patients, where each disease can only go
into one cluster and so it is not straightforward to relate patients to outcomes in order to
facilitate patient-centred policy-making12. Commonly used clustering methods were
exploratory approaches such as factor analysis and hierarchical clustering9,13, where results
were highly sensitive to the subjective choice of metrics14. Finally, the validity and
generalisability of cluster solutions in new samples is important for decision-making but is
often ignored in the current literature9,10.
This study aims to identify, validate and study the outcomes of age-stratified clusters of
multimorbid adult patients in a large representative sample of UK patients. Towards this end
we used a comprehensive list of 38 long-term conditions5 and a robust model-based
probabilistic approach, latent class analysis14.

Methods
Data source
Our analysis used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD database where
anonymised and longitudinal primary care clinical data are contributed by UK general
(family) practices (GP) who use the Vision health record system15. CPRD has been validated
to be representative of the UK population for age, sex, and ethnicity15,16. Patients’ GP
records were linked with hospitalisation data (Hospital Episodes Statistics, HES), all-cause
mortality data (Office for National Statistics, ONS) and area socioeconomic deprivation data
(Index of Multiple Deprivation, IMD); these linked data were available for approximately 75%
of CPRD English practices. The protocol for this study (16_057RA2) was approved
scientifically and ethically by the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee.

Study population
Data on a random selection of individuals were acquired from CPRD (the same individuals
studied in Cassell et al.,5). Patients aged 18 years and above with valid registered-status in a
practice with data classified by CPRD as “up-to-standard” in January 201215 were included in
the study. We chose the year 2012 to allow complete ascertainment of five-year mortality.
Additionally, we required that their practice allowed linkage to ONS, IMD and HES, resulting
in the inclusion of only English practices.

Patient and public involvement
There was no patient or public involvement in this study.

Statistical software
Data analysis was performed in R 3.4.4. R package names are given in the following
sections where appropriate (in brackets and italics), for example memory efficient packages
were used to extract data for analysis in R (ff, CALIBERdatamanage). For transparency and
reproducibility, all analysis scripts and code lists are available from https://github.com/Kiddlegroup.
Definition of patient characteristics, morbidities and outcomes
Morbidities in this study were defined as binary variables (present or not) based on the
classification of LTCs in primary care developed by Barnett et al.,7 This taxonomy attempted
to include all conditions “likely to be chronic (defined as having significant impact over at
least the most recent year) and with significant impact on patients in terms of need for
chronic treatment, reduced function, reduced quality of life, and risk of future morbidity and
mortality”, and was developed for use in UK primary care electronic health record research
and has been adapted for use in CPRD5. The specific definitions for each LTC is based on
the UK Read code system and electronic prescription data coded using CPRD’s prodcode,
giving a total of 38 LTCs. (https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/pcu/cprd_cam/codelists/v11/ ). The

LTCs used in this study largely match the only other large sample size UK multimorbidity
cluster study17.
Two sets of outcome variables related to service use and mortality were defined. NHS
service utilisation or treatment burden was measured by three variables over the 12-month
period after January 2012: primary care consultations (consultations with any clinician in the
primary care team), the number of all-type hospitalisation spells (defined by discharge dates)
and the amount of repeat prescriptions (at least four times in a year by counting the unique
British National Formulary (BNF) codes). All-cause mortality at two and five years was
extracted from ONS data.
Patient characteristics that were considered in this study include gender, age groups
(stratified into 18-44, 45-64, 65-84 and 85+ years) in 2012, last recorded pre-2012 body
mass index (BMI), last recorded pre-2012 smoking status (current, never and ex-smokers)
and socioeconomic status measured by IMD in quintiles (1 for the least deprived and 5 for
the most).

Statistical analysis
This study aims to identify clusters of multimorbid patients using patterns of co-existing longterm conditions. We used latent class analysis (LCA) (poLCA) to assign all patients to nonoverlapping clusters (i.e. each patient is assigned to only one cluster) in a data-driven
fashion18,19. Compared to other exploratory clustering methods (e.g. factor analysis,
hierarchical clustering10,20), LCA is a model-based probabilistic clustering approach that is
not sensitive to rotation of factors and does not require any subjective choice of “distance
measures” for multimorbidity patterns14,21.This greatly enhances the reproducibility and
stability of the latent class solutions. Clustering patients rather than diseases allows
diseases to belong to multiple clusters and more naturally allows the characteristics and
outcomes of clusters to be studied. As a result, each derived patient cluster has a unique
and probabilistic multimorbidity phenotype profile where members do not necessarily need to
have all conditions.
Guided by simulation studies22, the optimal number of latent classes was decided using a
combination of statistics (Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), sample-sized adjusted BIC,
log-likelihood ratio test, entropy for classification quality) and clinical judgment. Within our
datasets conditions are present (i.e. recorded) or not by definition, and so missing data
methods were not needed for cluster analysis. More details on a technical review of
commonly used clustering methods, the LCA methodology and application of selection
statistics are provided in supplementary material section 3.
To account for the different nature of multimorbidity clusters at different ages, four age strata
(18-44, 45-64, 65-84, 85+ years) were chosen. We derived the cluster solution and
performed post-hoc statistical tests in a stratified (by age strata) random sample of the
multimorbid population that contained 80% of the patients (i.e. training set). Separate LCAs
were performed for each stratum, and each patient allocated to a single multimorbidity
cluster. For ease of interpretation, clusters were labelled by their three most distinctive
conditions whose difference in prevalence between cluster and age strata were the highest
(see supplementary table 1 for full details of conditions). To quantify the association between

outcomes, multimorbidity clusters and patient demographics, generalised linear models were
fitted (see supplementary material section 5). Individuals with missing data for last pre-2012
recording of smoking status and BMI represented a small percentage (<5%) of the
population, and so were excluded from the generalised linear models.

Assessment of the stability of morbidity clusters
To assess the stability of age-stratified multimorbidity clusters, LCAs were repeated in the
remaining 20% of the population (i.e. test set), fixing the number of clusters to match that
learned from the training set23. We employed three methods to indirectly validate our cluster
solutions (a direct approach was not possible as clusters were unobserved). First, to check
the consistency between disease profiles for 38 LTCs in the training and test sets, each
cluster in the test set was matched (using two criteria for robustness) with a corresponding
cluster in the training set. Matched cluster pairs were selected such that Jensen–Shannon
distance24 (JSD, a measure of the divergence between disease profiles) is the smallest and
the bivariate Pearson’s correlation coefficient25 (the degree to which two disease profiles covary) is the highest (supplementary tables 4a, 4b). Second, entropy measures22 (for
classification quality) computed in the training and test sets were expected to be similar.
Finally, stability was further assessed by observing in the training and test sets similar
associations (in terms of size, direction and statistical significance) between clusters, patient
demographics and outcome variables. For more details, see supplementary material section
4.

Results
Characteristics of the study population
A total of 391,669 patients were included in the study, of which 49% and 22% had none or
only one long-term condition respectively (see Table 1 for patient demographics). Females,
older individuals and those from areas of greater socioeconomic deprivation had a higher
prevalence of multimorbidity.
Among the multimorbid patients (N=113,211, 29%), all unique combinations of conditions
were less than 1% prevalent in the total population with the most prevalent 20 containing
only pairs of conditions (supplementary table 2). This together with the large number of
unique combinations of conditions (supplementary table 3) indicated that multimorbidity
patterns were highly heterogeneous. Stratified by age strata, Table 2 shows that
multimorbidity in the younger population (18-44) was more common in areas with greater
deprivation while for older groups, the pattern is reversed.

Multimorbidity clusters and outcomes
For ease of reference we refer to each cluster by its lead or key conditions (i.e. one or three
conditions respectively, whose cluster-specific prevalence is highest, and higher than their
overall prevalence in their respective age group).
These clusters differ across age strata, both in terms of number of clusters per strata and
main components within each cluster (Table 3 and supplementary figures 1-4). The
association between multimorbidity clusters and outcomes (service use and mortality)
remained significant (p<0·01 in almost all clusters) after stratifying by age strata, controlling
for socioeconomic status, BMI and smoking behaviour (supplementary tables 8-11). Results
for the distribution of outcomes (e.g. median, interquartile range (IQR)), covariate-adjusted
incidence rate ratios for service utilisation and odds ratios (OR) for mortality derived from
generalised linear models are available in supplementary tables 8-15 (adjusted covariates
were gender, socioeconomic status, smoking status, BMI and age), but with a cautionary
note that the relationship between clusters, patient demographics and outcomes should not
be interpreted causally.
Age strata: 18-44 year olds
Five clusters were uncovered in the 18-44 age strata, whose lead conditions were
depression (the most common cluster), pain, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and
psychoactive substance misuse. Those in the cluster whose three key conditions were
depression (100%), anxiety (41%) and pain (31%) were found to have the highest use of
primary care consultations (median 12 [5-20] in a year). Those in the cluster whose three
key conditions were pain (36%), hearing loss (30%) and hypertension (23%) were found to
have the highest hospital admission rates (an average of 0.6 visits in a year) and the highest
number of medicines repeatedly prescribed (median1 [0-4] unique drug classes in a year).
Highest mortality in this age range was found in the least prevalent (7%) multimorbidity
cluster whose three key conditions were psychoactive substance misuse (75%), alcohol
problems (42%) and depression (24%) (3.9% mortality in five years). This level of mortality
was 18 times higher than that of individuals in the same age range without multimorbidity
(0.2%). This cluster was predominantly male (72%), socio-economically deprived (63% in
greater deprivation) and with high smoking rates (76% current smokers).
Age strata: 45-64 year olds
In the 45-64 age strata, LCA revealed five clusters, whose lead conditions were
hypertension (the most common cluster), irritable bowel syndrome, depression, asthma and
alcohol problems. Those in the cluster whose three key conditions were depression (93%),
pain (53%) and anxiety (31%) had the highest number of primary care consultations (median
14 [7-23] in a year), admission rates (an average of 0.6 visits in a year) and prescribing rates
(median 4 [2-7]). As in the younger age strata, the least prevalent multimorbidity cluster (4%)
had the highest death rate (13% in five years), its key conditions were alcohol problems
(62%), psychoactive substance misuse (42%) and pain (28%). Again, this cluster was
characterised by being typically male smokers from areas of high socio-economic
deprivation. Pain as a co-morbidity was represented in all the clusters in this age group.

Age strata: 65-84 year olds
Six clusters were found in the 65-84 age strata, whose lead conditions were hypertension
(the most common cluster), hearing loss, depression, coronary heart disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and pain. The least prevalent multimorbidity cluster (5%),
whose key conditions were pain (81%), coronary heart disease (53%) and depression (45%)
had the highest use of primary care consultations (median 23 [14-35] in a year), admission
rates (an average of 1.6 visits in a year), prescribing rates (median 11 [8-14]) and death
rates (39% mortality in five years). Again, this cluster consists of patients with the highest
level of deprivation (43%).
Age strata: above 85 year olds
The 85+ age stratum was composed of four clusters, whose lead conditions were
hypertension (the most common), pain, heart failure and asthma. The majority of patients
(58%) fitted within a cluster whose key conditions were hypertension (72%), hearing loss
(39%) and diabetes (18%). The cluster with the majority of patients had the lowest mortality
(50% five-year mortality), as well as the least number of conditions (median 3 [2-4]
morbidities), and the least health care utilisation (roughly half the GP contacts,
hospitalisations and medicines on repeat prescription of the cluster whose lead condition
was “coronary heart disease”). The cluster with the highest mortality, GP contact,
hospitalisations and repeat prescriptions comprised a trio of cardiac conditions: coronary
heart disease, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

Validation of cluster morbidity profiles
As well as validating the clusters by their association with patient characteristics and
outcomes, the similarity of multimorbidity clusters were compared between the training set
(80% of patients, N=90,571) and the test set (the other 20% of patients, N=22,640). Results
are summarised below, and given in full in supplementary material section 4. Measures of
cluster quality (i.e. entropy) were found to be consistent between the training and test sets.
As the training set contained more disease patterns, the derived clusters were more
comprehensive. The test set (with fewer patients) contained fewer disease patterns and
therefore we expected the derived clusters to be a subset of those in the training set. Indeed,
validation of cluster profiles showed that every cluster in the test set found a match in the
training set. Some clusters were particularly robust (had the smallest JSD and the highest
Pearson’s correlation coefficient), for instance, those in the largest age strata (65-84 age
strata, N = 49,494), and clusters whose lead condition was depression, psychoactive drug
misuse or alcohol problems. Clusters with a less clear match were the cluster in the 18-44
age strata whose lead condition was asthma.

Discussion
Summary of results and comparison with other studies
This study identified and validated clusters of multimorbid patients using a novel patientcentred approach. In summary, we identified twenty patient clusters across four age strata.
In the younger age-strata (18-44; 45-64), the clusters with the highest mortality (18 times
higher than the non-multimorbid group in 18-44 year olds) comprised psychoactive
substance abuse in combination with alcohol problems. The clusters with the most contact
with general practice in people aged under 65 comprised depressions, anxiety and pain. In
65-84 year olds, the cluster with the highest mortality and highest health service use (GP
contact; hospitalisations; repeat prescriptions) comprised pain, coronary heart disease and
depression, and in people aged 85 or over, it comprised heart failure, coronary heart disease
and atrial fibrillation. The most common cluster in 18-44 year olds was centred around
depression, but in all other age groups, they were centred around hypertension. In the oldest
age group, this hypertension-centred cluster was associated with the best survival and
lowest health service use among multimorbid patients. Pain featured in thirteen of the
clusters.
In this study, unlike most previous analyses of multimorbidity, we have defined clusters in
terms of patients rather than diseases9,10. As a result, we have identified novel clusters that
have practical implications for service delivery. The high mortality of the cluster of
psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse warrants attention, and the descriptive
epidemiology of this cluster (male, smoker, under age 65, high socio-economic deprivation,
relatively low service use) gives pointers as how the poor health might be addressed.
Conversely, we found that the commonest cluster in people aged 85 and over (58% of
patients with multi-morbidity in this age group) was associated with the least health service
use and the lowest mortality. This gives a more nuanced perspective on the association of
multimorbidity with age that has been widely reported7, in that it suggests that in the oldest
age group, multimorbidity per se may be less important, although numerically most common.
Our age-stratified approach also enables different patterns of co-morbidity to be identified.
Thus, in younger age groups, clusters focused around mental health are associated with
most GP contact, in people aged 65-84, a cluster of mental health and coronary heart
disease is associated with most GP contact, and other indicators of health service use,
whereas in people aged over 85, the cluster representing most health service contact is
dominated by cardiovascular conditions. In terms of relative importance of single conditions
within multimorbid clusters, the predominance of mental health conditions and hypertension
has been identified in previous work9,10,17,26. A novel finding in our work is the inclusion of
pain in many of the clusters we identified. There are several possible explanations for this,
including the conditions studied, as well as the different methodological approach we took.

Strengths and limitations
The robust identification of such clusters would not have been possible without the novel use
of age-stratification, patient-level clustering (not requiring all patients to have identical lists of
conditions) and validation with held-out data. This is the largest scale application of agestratified latent class analysis to multimorbidity, both in patient numbers (above 100,000) and

the number of conditions (38)10. By including younger patients and stratifying by age we see
how multimorbidity clusters differ over the lifecourse. Combining this with the release of
reproducible analysis scripts is an approach which we recommend for future multimorbidity
clustering efforts. Our systematic approach including all 38 conditions from Barnett et al., 7
age-stratification, clustering and outcomes, was necessary to handle the complexity of
multimorbidity in healthcare.
This study suffers from typical limitations of electronic health record research in that they rely
on routine coding within the healthcare system including residual confounding and variable
CPRD data quality. Wherever practically feasible we have taken steps to address these, e.g.
the careful design of codelists, relying on variables with low missingness and adjusting for
key variables. While the clustering approach used (LCA) is a robust probabilistic approach,
results may differ subtly if other approaches are used. Validation of latent clusters also
requires further research where a larger sample size for the test set, perhaps from another
database or country, can strengthen the validation. Despite this, given the large and
representative sample, the consistency of results both internally, across age strata and with
existing literature, we are confident in our main results. Finally, multimorbidity evolves over
time, but we only use longitudinal data to extract conditions in 2012 and service use and
mortality outcomes.

Conclusion and policy implications
These multimorbidity clusters highlight major targets for public health and healthcare, giving
a more nuanced understanding of multimorbidity than the work of Barnett et al7 and others
which rely more on simple disease counts. The 18-fold higher mortality of younger
multimorbid patients with psychoactive substance misuse is a clear case of an unmet need.
Improving outcomes for this neglected patient group is likely to be feasible given that their
risk factors (drug use, smoking, deprivation) are potentially amenable to intervention.
Conversely, the fact that the majority of older multimorbid patients have relatively low service
use and mortality has implications for the design of health services. More generally, the fact
that chronic pain is a key feature of many multimorbidity clusters suggest that it is important
to manage pain within the context of multimorbidity rather than in its own right. Similarly, our
findings add to the evidence showing the importance of mental health in multimorbid
patients, justifying the push for parity of physical and mental health within the healthcare
system.
While patients with multimorbidity account for an ever increasing proportion of healthcare
need and provision1,4,5,7, no existing interventions have shown convincing evidence of
benefit in improving important outcomes8,27. Our findings fit with the suggestion from
Salisbury et al.,8 that one reason for the failure of previous interventions is that
multimorbidity is heterogeneous, with very different diseases, needs and outcomes in
different groups of patients. Our findings support the proposal that interventions to improve
outcomes in multimorbidity may be more appropriately targeted on distinct types, and we
have systematically highlighted groups of patients where tailored approaches could be
attempted.

Table 3 Descriptions of the derived clusters of multimorbid patients for each age strata. Clusters are ordered by sizes from the largest to the smallest. Key conditions are the three
estimated to be most distinctive in the cluster (where the difference between within-cluster prevalence and prevalence in age strata is the largest). For the number of morbidities, median, first
(Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles are reported. For other categorical variables, percentages are reported. Greater deprivation denotes top 40% of IMD (categories 4 and 5).

Table 4 Mortality and health service utilisation by patient clusters in each age strata. Clusters are ordered by the highest to lowest mortality. The non-multimorbid
cluster contains patients with zero or only one long-term condition. The number of GP consultations, hospitalisations and repeat prescriptions (by counting the number of
unique BNF codes that were in repeated prescriptions at least four times), are measured in one year after January 2012. Both mean and median are reported because they
highlight different aspects of skewed distributions, especially in relation to hospitalisations and prescriptions.
