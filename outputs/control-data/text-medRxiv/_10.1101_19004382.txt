ABSTRACT
Objectives: In the emergency department (ED), high blood pressure (BP) is commonly
observed but mostly used to evaluate patients’ health in the short-term. We aimed to study
whether ED-measured BP is associated with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD), myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in long-term, and to estimate the number
needed to screen (NNS) to prevent ASCVD.
Design: Electronic Health Records (EHR) and national register-based cohort study. The
association between BP and incident ASCVD was studied with Cox-regression.
Setting: Two university hospital emergency departments in Sweden.
Data sources: BP data were obtained from EDs EHR, and outcome information was acquired
through the Swedish National Patient Register for all participants.
Participants: All patients ≥18 years old who visited the EDs between 2010 to 2016, with an
obtained BP (n=300,193).
Main outcome measures: Incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke during follow-up.
Results: The subjects were followed for a median of 42 months. 8,999 incident ASCVD
events occurred (MI: 4,847, stroke: 6,661). Both diastolic and systolic BP (SBP) was
associated with incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke with a progressively increased risk for SBP
within hypertension grade 1 (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.24), 2 (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25 to
1.47), and 3 (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.77). The six-year cumulative incidence of ASCVD
was 12% for patients with SBP ≥180 mmHg compared to 2% for normal levels. To prevent
one ASCVD event during the median follow-up, NNS was estimated to 151, whereas NNT to
71.
Conclusions: BP in the ED is associated with incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke. High BP
recordings in EDs should not be disregarded as isolated events, but an opportunity to detect
and improve treatment of hypertension. ED-measured BP provides an important and under-

INTRODUCTION
High blood pressure (BP) is a well-studied and established risk factor for cardiovascular
disease (CVD)1-3 and is commonly observed in the emergency department (ED).4
Hypertension accounts for nearly fifty per cent of the mortality in stroke and heart disease,
and every year approximately 9.4 million cardiovascular deaths occur due to complications of
hypertension, which makes hypertension the most important risk factor for disability and
death worldwide.5
Finding and treating patients with hypertension is a priority in CVD prevention. Studies have
shown that for every 10-20-mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), there is a
substantial risk reduction for CVD,6-8 and that patients with higher BP levels benefit from
more intensive drug intervention.9 However, a majority of the patients with high BP do not
achieve BP control (BP < 140/90 mm Hg), and many are unaware of their condition.10
In the ED, BP is measured on almost every patient in order to assess the patient’s condition
and acuity11,12 regardless of the presenting chief complaint. Previous research has reported
that up to one-third of the patients in the ED have BP levels above the threshold for
hypertension, and severely elevated levels have been observed in 20 % of the cases.11
Elevated BP in the ED can be explained by factors such as pain, anxiety or other stressors,
which raises the question of its predictive value and if hypertension screening based on
routine recordings in the ED are useful.4
Although the value of BP in the ED as hypertension screening can be questioned,13 it is not
known if high BP in the ED is associated with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD), nor the benefit on acting in this setting. Therefore, we aimed to examine if the first
measured BP in the ED is associated with incident ASCVD, MI, or stroke during a long-time
follow-up. We also aimed to assess the potential benefits of screening for patients with
hypertension in the ED by estimating the number needed to screen and treat to prevent

ASCVD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and setting
This electronic health records (EHR) and register-based cohort study included all patients
who visited the EDs at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna and Huddinge, Sweden during
the period from January 2010 until March 2016, with a BP measured in the ED. The exposure
BP was obtained from EDs EHR, and all outcome information were acquired by linkage to
national registers for all included participants. The participants were followed regarding
incident disease, death or censoring until end of the study on 31st December 2016. The study
was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03954119.

Inclusion criteria
The study cohort was all patients visiting the EDs with a BP obtained at arrival. Patients were
eligible for inclusion in the study disregarded of the chief complaint as long as they had a BP
recorded and were older than 18 years old. Patients without a Swedish personal identification
number were excluded since no outcome information could be obtained from these patients.
Only the first visit in the ED with a measured BP was included. Recurrent BP measurements
during hospitalisation or recurrent visits to the ED with new BP recordings were disregarded.

Data sources
BP data and all covariates were acquired through Karolinska University Hospital’s EHR for
each patient’s ED visit. The National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW) provided data
for outcome events and event dates until the end of December 2016, from the National Patient
Register for the selected subjects. Hypertension diagnosis before index visits were collected

from this register from the period January 1997 to December 2016. The cause of death and
date of death were obtained through the NBHW’s Cause of Death Register. Data for each
subject in the registers were merged to one dataset by the unique pseudonymised
identification number. Data for pick-up of prescribed drugs were acquired from the NBHW’s
Prescribed Drugs Register.

Exposure definitions
The exposures were defined as the first measured SBP and DBP in the ED; both measured as
a part of the triage system according to clinical routine.12 BP was categorised into groups due
to no certain linear association for BP with the outcomes. The categories were based on the
ESC and ESH classification of BP grades and the definition of hypertension grades.14 SBP
categories were defined as <90 mmHg, 90-119 mmHg, 120-129 mmHg, 130-139 mmHg,
140-159 mmHg, 160-179 mmHg, and >179 mmHg. DBP were categorised into <60 mmHg,
60-79 mmHg, 80-84 mmHg, 85-89 mmHg, 90-99 mmHg, 100-109 mmHg, and >110 mmHg
(Supplementary Table 1).

Endpoint definitions
The composited primary endpoint was ASCVD, defined as the first occurring event of CHD
death (fatal MI and sudden cardiac death), non-fatal MI and all-cause stroke, based on the
pooled cohort risk equations.15 Secondary endpoints were fatal and non-fatal MI, all-cause
stroke, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral haemorrhage. Data for endpoints were derived as
the primary diagnosis from the National Patient Register and Cause of Death Register,
according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition16 (ICD-10). ICD-10
classification for ASCVD was fatal CHD (MI: I210-I214, I219, I220, I221, I228, I229,
sudden cardiac death: I461 or I469), non-fatal MI (I210-I214, I219, I220, I221, I228 or I229),

fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke (I630-I635, I638 or I639) (Supplementary Table 2). Only
the first event that occurred in the follow-up period was included in the endpoint ASCVD,
and all following recurrent events were disregarded. Secondary endpoints were defined as
fatal and non-fatal MI (I210-I214, I219, I220, I221, I228 or I229. I200 were included if
combined with intervention procedure codes FNA-FNG, FNW), all-cause stroke (I610-I619,
I630-I635, I638-I639, or I649), ischemic stroke (I630-I635 or I638-I639), and intracerebral
haemorrhage (I610-I619) (Supplementary Table 3).

Variables for subgroup analyses
Patients with a diagnosis of hypertension before the ED visit were identified through a record
of hypertension (I109) or a pick-up of a prescription of antihypertensive drugs within the
preceding 12 months of the index visit. Antihypertensive drugs were defined according to the
anatomic therapeutic classification (ATC) (Supplementary Table 4).

Follow-up period
The baseline for follow-up was defined as the time patients were discharged either from the
ED or from inpatient care, in order to not include events during hospital care linked to the
index visit and thereby avoid effects of an outcome occurring before the exposure. For
patients that were not admitted to inpatient care but were directly discharged from the ED,
one day was added after they were discharged, in order to avoid misclassification of a
hospitalisation that had been referred to from the ED-visit.

Addressing potential bias
The risk of selection bias was minimised by the broad inclusion criteria for this study. BP
categories were defined according to the clinically relevant definitions by the ESC and ESH.14

All outcomes were determined in advance with established definitions, disclosed in the trial
registration at clinicaltrials.gov. The Swedish National Patient Register, from which the
outcome data were obtained, has high validity.17

Statistical analysis
Hazard ratios (HR) for primary and secondary endpoints were estimated with Cox
proportional hazard regression. Age, sex, inclusion year, and hospital were adjusted for in
multivariate analyses. Age was controlled with restricted cubic splines with four knots in
order to adjust for the gradually increasing impact of higher age on event rates. The reference
BP categories in the analysis were set to the normal BP level according to ESC and ESH
classification;14 SBP reference category was 120-129 mmHg, and DBP reference category
was 80-84 mmHg. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by analysing
Schoenfeld residuals. Subgroup analyses for the outcome ASCVD were performed with Cox
proportional hazard regression for patients with a history of hypertension, for hospitalised
patients, and by chief complaints. All chief complaints were categorised by medicine
discipline based on the managing emergency department and type of chief complaint
(Supplementary Table 5). Cumulative incidence functions for SBP categories were estimated
for the endpoints with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Cases with missing exposure and outcome
data were excluded from the analyses. Descriptive statistics of the study population were
presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or relative and absolute frequencies grouped by
SBP categories. A p-value of <0,05 was considered to be significant. STATA version 15.1
was used for the analysis. Participants with missing BP data or had an outcome before followup baseline were disregarded from the analysis.
To assess the potential benefit of screening for high BP among patients in the ED, a number
needed to screen (NNS) and number needed to treat (NNT) were estimated for CHD, stroke,

and ASCVD. The estimates were based on the relative risk reduction (RRR) reported in
previous research, where a 10-mmHg SBP reduction yielded a risk reduction by 22% for
CHD and 14% for stroke, irrespectively of baseline BP.8 Potentially preventable events (PPE)
per ED patient were calculated for all subjects with a SBP ≥140 mmHg based on the RRR.
PPE was weighted by the visits for each year, and NNS was derived by the inverse of the PPE
per ED patient, presented with a 95% CI.

Patient and public involvement
Participants were not involved in the design of this study, nor the definition of exposures,
outcome measures or the setting. Participants were not asked to advise on interpreting the data
or contributed to writing the manuscript.

RESULTS
A total of 300,193 patients were included in the study after the inclusion criteria (Figure 1).
The mean age was 50.0±20.2 years, female patients comprised 53.9% (n=161,707) of the
study population, and the mean SBP was 139.9 mmHg (Table 1). Subjects were followed for
a mean time of 3.5 years, which resulted in 1.1 million person-years. The most common chief
complaint was abdominal pain, chest pain, breathing difficulties, headache, and fever.
(Supplementary Table 5). SBP data were missing for 59 (0.02%) subjects, and 1,992 (0.67%)
subjects had data missing for DBP. No subject were missing data for both SBP and DBP.
Outcome data were obtained for all included participants.

Incident ASCVD occurred in 3.0% (n=8,999) of the cohort during a median follow-up for 42
months (range 0-84 month). Men were more likely to develop ASCVD (3.7%) compared to
females (2.4%). BP was associated with incident ASCVD with a progressively increased
hazard ratio among patients with SBP above reference categories. Within SBP, the strongest
association was observed for ≥180 mmHg (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.49-1.77) (Table 2). The sixyear cumulative incidence of ASCVD for the reference SBP group (120-129 mmHg) was 2%
compared to 12% in the highest SBP category (≥180 mmHg) (Figure 2). A statistically
significant increased association were observed in all categories above the reference category
for DBP.

For the secondary endpoint MI, a total of 4,847 (1.6%) events occurred in the entire cohort,
the majority 63.2% (n=3,117) among men. There was a statistically significant association
between BP and incident MI with a gradually increased HR by higher BP above the reference
category. (Figure 3-4). The six-year cumulative incidence was 1% for the reference category
compared to 7% in the highest SBP group (Figure 5).
A total of 6,661 (2.2%) all-cause stroke events occurred, and of those were 51.0% male
(n=3,470). Patients with DBP ≥110 had more than a twofold association (HR 2.16, 95% CI
1.93-2.41) to a stroke event (Figure 4-5). The six-year cumulative incidence was 1% for the
reference category compared to 9% in the highest SBP group (Figure 6).
For the endpoints ischemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage, a total of 5,355 respectively
1,119 events occurred. The highest HR for ischemic stroke was in the ≥110 mmHg DBP
category (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.68-2.17. The strongest association for intracerebral
haemorrhage was in the top DBP category (HR 3.56 95% CI 2.80-4.52) (Figure 4-5).

Subgroup analyses
Patients with a history of hypertension had 5,667 (7.6%) ASCVD events, compared to 3,300
(1.5%) for those without the condition (Supplementary Table 6). BP above the reference
category had a progressively increased association with ASCVD regardless of previous
hypertension. Patients with no prior hypertension diagnosis had a lower absolute event rate,
but a stronger and steeper relative association with ASCVD compared to the hypertension
group. The strongest association for ASCVD was in SBP ≥180 mmHg, for patients with no
history of hypertension (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.75-2.33) (Figure 7).
A total of 76,474 patients (25.5%) were admitted to inpatient care and among these were
50.5% men. The admitted patients had 4,614 ASCVD events during the study period
compared to 4,323 events for those who were directly discharged. The mean age for the

admitted patients were 60.0±20.4 years and 46.5±18.9 years for the other group. There was a
progressively increased hazard ratio among patients with SBP in the categories above the
reference group. The association was similar in the two groups in the adjusted model. (Figure
8).
The most common chief complaint was in the internal medicine discipline with 3,934 incident
ASCVD events (Supplementary Table 7). There was a gradual association above the
reference category between BP and incident ASCVD in all chief complaints except for the
orthopaedics and otolaryngology disciplines. The strongest association for BP with ASCVD
was in the surgery discipline in the crude model (HR 9.35, 95% CI 7.48-11.70). In the
adjusted model, the strongest association with ASCVD were in the neurology discipline
(Figure 9).

Number needed to screen
PPE was estimated to 1,966 ASCVD events, 672 CHD, 1,252 strokes. The estimated NNS to
find high BP and to prevent one event for ASCVD, CHD and stroke, during a median of 42
months of follow-up, was 151 (95% CI 127-190), 442 (95% CI 360-572), and 157 (95% CI
134-195), respectively, whereas the NNT was estimated to 71, 208, and 112. For patients that
were directly discharged, NNS for ASCVD was 216, whereas, NNT for high BP was
estimated to 103. To prevent one fatal ASCVD event, 450 patients in the ED needed to be
screened for high BP and 150 of those needed to be treated for high BP. (Table 3)

DISCUSSION
The main finding in this study was the strong association between BP recorded in the ED and
incident ASCVD, irrespective of whether patients were admitted to inpatient care or had a
history of hypertension. In patients without a history of hypertension, the association with
incident ASCVD was stronger, than for those with an established diagnosis. By using effect
sizes for antihypertensive treatment from meta-analysis8, we estimated that to prevent one
future ASCVD event during a median of 42 months of follow-up, antihypertensive treatment
needed to be initiated in 71 patients with an ED-measured SBP ≥140 mmHg.
The association with ASCVD was gradually increasing for BP levels that corresponded to
hypertension grade 1, 2 and 314 (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, a statistically
significant association with incident ASCVD was observed for patients with DBP level in the
high normal category. Our findings show that hypertension grades may be of interest for the
ED setting, and ED-measured BP is of value not only to evaluate the acuity of the patient’s
health but also to identify patients at high risk for cardiovascular events in the long-term and
therefore provides a tool to prevent them.
Previous population-based research has shown that an increase in SBP results in a
substantially increased risk for cardiovascular events, irrespective of baseline BP. 6,7 While
findings in the present study also showed a strong association between BP and incident
ASCVD, the magnitude of the effect was smaller in comparison to the population-based
studies. Since the current study did not account for the regression dilution bias due to single
BP measurements, our findings probably underestimate the true association between BP in the
ED and incident ASCVD.18 The influence of different stressors, both related to acute disease
and the ED environment, may cause an increase of BP in the ED, and elevated BP levels are
commonly observed.4 Previously, the prognostic relevance of elevated BP in the ED, and if it
can be a basis for decisions to initiate or intensify antihypertensive treatment in this setting

has been unknown. However, it should be noted that BP measured during other stress, such as
exercise, previously have provided independent prognostic information regarding incident
ASCVD.19,20 Although it can be speculated that different mechanisms influence BP in the ED
and its association with ASCVD, which may explain some of the differences in this study
compared to the population-based studies. Here we, for the first time, provide evidence that a
first BP obtained in the ED among an unselected population with ED visitors is associated
with incident ASCVD.
All secondary endpoints had similar results as for ASCVD. However, there was a remarkably
strong association between DBP ≥110 mmHg and incident intracerebral haemorrhage, in the
adjusted model, which none of the previously population-based studies has reported.
Patients with a history of hypertension had a higher absolute risk to develop ASCVD, but
interestingly the association between elevated BP and incident ASCVD was stronger for
patients with no history of hypertension. A possible explanation may be that antihypertensive
treatment used in the hypertension group attenuated the association.
The estimated NNS was based on the assumption that all detected patients with an SBP ≥140
mmHg were prescribed adequate antihypertensive therapy and succeeded a 10-mmHg SBPreduction. Prior research has presented a NNS for hypertension with BP-lowering actions,21 to
the best of our knowledge none have reported the potential benefit of using BPs obtained in
the ED with an estimated potential benefit of reduced events. Findings in this study indicate
that the ED-setting has great potential to find undiagnosed and undertreated hypertension,
which will reduce morbidity and mortality in CVD if effective antihypertensive therapy is
initiated.
The main strength of this study was the large cohort size and the long follow-up period, which
yielded a strong statistical power. The Swedish National Patient register is well-known for its
high-quality and accurate data, with a high reported positive predictive value for most of the

diagnoses.17 It is noticeable that a few cases had missing data. One potential weakness in this
study was the uncertainty of how BP was measured, and due to discrepancies in methods for
obtaining BP, deviations for BP may vary from case to case. Preferred end-digits for BP by
multiples of 5 and 10 were noticed in the data, which indicates that rounding occurred for
some cases. The impact of the rounding was reduced by categorising the BP into groups.
Another limitation is that any changes in antihypertensive treatment that were initiated based
on elevated ED-measured BP were not considered. Such treatment may have attenuated the
association with incident ASCVD and therefore underestimated the true association.
We encourage future studies to investigate whether initiation of antihypertensive treatment in
the ED yield better long-term prognosis for patients with elevated ED-recorded BP, compared
to current praxis.
The clinical value of the findings in this study is that ED-measured BP has a great potential to
find undiagnosed hypertension and to prevent future ASCVD events if antihypertensive
therapy is initiated. Patients directly discharged from the ED should be assessed more
carefully as no further BP recordings take place. One ASCVD event could be prevented for
every 107 discharged patients with a high BP if effective antihypertensive therapy is initiated.
Thereby, high BP recordings should not be disregarded as isolated events but should result in
an initiation of antihypertensive treatment or referral for follow-up evaluation. It is
conceivable that the external validity of this study applies to other EDs, particularly
considering the broad inclusion criteria, which included all Swedish citizens ≥ 18 years old
with a BP obtained in the ED.
In conclusion, findings in this study show that elevated BP, when measured in the ED, is
strongly associated with incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke. High BP recordings in EDs should
not be disregarded as isolated events, but an opportunity to detect and improve treatment of
hypertension. ED-measurements of BP provide an important and under-used tool with great

SUMMARY
What is already known on this topic
-

Hypertension is the leading risk factor for CVD and remains a global challenge in
prevention, detection, and improving treatment.

-

Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of incident ASCVD.

-

BP is recorded in most patients in the ED, but the predictive value of BP recorded in
the ED for the long-term prognosis is unknown. It is not known whether elevated BP
in the ED is associated with ASCVD, MI or stroke.

What this study adds
-

This is the first study to report the association between ED-recorded BP and long-term
incident cardiovascular diseases.

-

Elevated BP in the ED is progressively associated with incident ASCVD, MI and
stroke, for BP levels above normal (SBP: ≥140 mmHg and DBP: ≥90 mmHg)

-

The six-year cumulative incidence of ASCVD in SBP ≥180 was 12%, compared to
2% for the normal SBP.

-

To prevent one ASCVD event, during a median of 42 months of follow-up, the
number needed to screen for high BP in the ED was 151, whereas the number needed
to treat with antihypertensive treatment was estimated to 71 patients.

-

ED-measurements of BP provide an important and under-used tool with great
potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.
