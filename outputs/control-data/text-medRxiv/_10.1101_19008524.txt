Abstract
Background
Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are at risk of long-term
cognitive and metabolic sequelae. This study investigates genome-wide DNA methylation in
patients with CAH to determine whether there is evidence for epigenomic reprogramming as
well as any relationship to patient outcome.
Methods
We analysed CD4+ T cell DNA from 28 patients with CAH (mean age=18.5
±6.5 years [y]) and 37 population controls (mean age=17.0 ±6.1 y) with the InfiniumHumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to measure genome-wide locus-specific DNA
methylation levels. Effects of CAH, phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype on methylation were
investigated as well as the association between differentially methylated CpGs, metabolic
profiles (glucose homeostasis and blood lipid profile) and cognitive outcome. In addition, we
report data on a small cohort of 11 patients (mean age=19.1, ±6.0 y) with CAH who were
treated prenatally with dexamethasone (DEX).
Results
We identified two CpGs to be associated with patient phenotype: cg18486102
(located in the FAIM2 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.027) and cg02404636 (located in the
SFI1 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.038). cg02404636 was also associated with genotype
(rho=0.59, adjusted p=0.024). We did not observe any effect of DEX on DNA methylation in
individuals with CAH. No significant association was found between FAIM2 methylation and
cognitive or metabolic outcome. However, SFI1 TSS methylation was associated with fasting
plasma HDL cholesterol levels (p=0.035).
Conclusion

In conclusion, higher methylation levels in CpG sites covering FAIM2 and SFI1
were associated with disease severity. Hypermethylation in these genes may have
implications for long-term cognitive and metabolic outcome in patients with CAH.

Précis
The present study investigates DNA methylation in CD4+ T-cells acquired from patients with
congenital adrenal hyperplasia and healthy control subjects. The associations between
epigenetic alterations and clinical outcome are also investigated.

Introduction
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is one
of the most common inborn errors of metabolism (1). Ten common CYP21A2 mutations are
identified in 95% of all CAH cases, where the phenotype is dictated by the less severe allele.
The clinical manifestations of CAH include a broad spectrum of phenotypes and generally a
good correlation exists between genotype and phenotype (2). In the most severe salt-wasting
form of CAH (SW CAH) the synthesis of both cortisol and aldosterone is severely affected.
Indeed, a young infant will succumb to disease and then death in a salt-losing crisis if
treatment is not initiated within the first weeks of life. In the simple-virilising form of CAH
(SV CAH) aldosterone production is sufficient to avoid salt loss during basal conditions. Girls
affected with classic forms of CAH are exposed to high levels of adrenal androgens prenatally
and are born with virilised external genitalia. Dexamethasone (DEX) has been administered to
pregnant mothers at risk of having a child with classic CAH to prevent the virilisation of girls
with CAH already in utero (3). The mild, non-classic form (NC CAH) is associated with signs
of androgen excess from late childhood, but it may escape diagnosis until adulthood (4-6).
Postnatally, patients with CAH are treated with life-long glucocorticoid (GC) replacement
therapy; for classic CAH, treatment with fludrocortisone is necessary additional to GCs (1).
During different periods throughout life, it may be difficult to achieve perfect dosing of GC
replacement therapy, which ultimately leads to either over- or under-treatment (7).
With the implementation of neonatal screening programmes for CAH and
continuous improvement in clinical care, CAH has become a lifelong chronic disease. Over
time, patients with CAH are at risk of metabolic and cognitive sequelae later in life (8-11).
They typically present with obesity, insulin resistance and altered lipid profiles (7,8,12). For
cognitive outcome, while results are conflicting, the overall evidence suggests that patients
with CAH are at risk of impaired executive functions and, more specifically, working

memory (10,11,13,14). Furthermore, mental health studies indicate that women and men with
CAH have an increased risk of being diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (15,16).
Outcome may also depend on clinical phenotype and/or genotype, where
patients with SW CAH have more difficulties than patients with milder phenotypes
(8,9,17,18). While the exact causes of each outcome cannot always be identified, most
commonly they are attributed to GC replacement therapy and the inherent difficulties in
mimicking the circadian cortisol rhythm. However, prenatal androgen exposure, prenatal GC
deficit and postnatal adrenal crises may also affect long-term patient outcome. In addition,
prenatal treatment with DEX may impact patient outcome.
Previously, we have identified cognitive deficits in first-trimester DEX-treated
healthy (not diagnosed with CAH) children. These effects seem to be sex-dimorphic because
exposed girls were more affected than exposed boys (19). In one of our recent reports we
showed that women with CAH who were treated with DEX during the entire gestational
period had broad deficits in cognition similar to what we observed in healthy treated girls
during childhood (9).
Epigenetic mechanisms (such as DNA CpG methylation and histone
modification) play a key role in the development of different diseases (20,21). The DNA
methylation profile is set during development but does not remain stable throughout life.
Changes in methylation have been associated with human disease, environmental changes,
changes in physiological activity (22) and even changes in the social environment (23,24).
Moreover, we have identified broad changes in DNA methylation measured in peripheral
CD4+ T-cells from children not having CAH and exposed to prenatal DEX treatment during
the first-trimester (25). We may therefore postulate that DNA methylation is altered in

patients with CAH and that it may be a potential mediating mechanism exerting influence on
the long-term outcome.
This study investigates if epigenetic modification of DNA occurs in patients
with CAH and whether methylation is associated with disease severity (clinical phenotype
and genotype) in a unique and well-characterized group of patients. We hypothesize that
DNA methylation is a stable fingerprint of the effects of CAH during embryonic development
and later in life and that changes in CpG methylation are associated with metabolic and
cognitive outcome. We also investigate whether prenatal DEX treatment generates longlasting effects on CpG methylation profiles in a small but unique group of patients with CAH
that have been exposed to such therapy either during the first trimester or during the entire
gestational period. To achieve this end we isolated CD4+ T cells from children and adults
with CAH and from controls from the general population for comparison of DNA methylation
levels and metabolic and cognitive outcome.
Methods
Participants
The study is part of a larger study investigating the effects of pre- and postnatal
treatment in patients with CAH (for details, see Wallensteen et al. (19)). Here we investigate
the effects of pre- and postnatal GC treatment on whole genome methylation in patients with
CAH (vs. controls form the general population) and whether changes in CpG methylation are
associated with cognitive and metabolic outcome. Written informed consent of all participants
or their parents was obtained, the study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of
Stockholm (dnr. 99-153).
In total, 76 participants were included in the study: 28 patients (12 females and
16 males) with CAH (mean age=18.5 years [y], ±6.5 y), 11 patients (7 females and 4 males)

with CAH treated prenatally with DEX (mean age=19.1 y, ±=6.0 y) and 37 control subjects
from the general population (18 females and 19 males, mean age=17.0 y, ±=6.1 y). Two
patients with CAH had NC CAH, 13 had SV CAH and 24 had the SW phenotype.
Demographic data are presented in Table 1. The vast majority of the patients were diagnosed
via the Swedish national neonatal screening programme for CAH.

Procedures
All participants were instructed not to eat after midnight the night before the
visit. Blood samples for methylation analysis and analysis of glucose homeostasis and lipid
profiles were collected in the morning. The participants’ height and weight were measured
immediately after sample collection. Blood (B) glucose, serum (S) Insulin, S-C-peptide, BHbA1c, plasma (P) triglycerides, P cholesterol, P HDL cholesterol and P LDL cholesterol
were analysed at the accredited clinical chemistry laboratory at the Karolinska University
Hospital. A detailed description of the procedures and tests used to assess cognitive
performance is given in Karlsson et al, (9) and Wallensteen et al. (19). Here, we included
estimates of general intelligence (WISC-III/WAIS-IV, Matrices and Vocabulary) and
executive functions (WISC-III/WAIS-IV, Coding, Digit Span and Stroop Interference) (2628). Before the analyses, raw scores from the neuropsychological assessments were
transformed into scaled scores (mean=10, SD=3) based on age-specific Swedish norms for
subtests from the Wechsler Scales. Raw scores from the Stroop Test were transformed into T
scores (mean=50, SD=10) according to the North American norms (28).

Isolation of T-cells and flow cytometry
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by density
centrifugation from 50 ml of whole blood per participant. CD4+ T cells were isolated from

the PBMCs using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS, Miltenyi Biotech) and stored at 80°C. The purity of CD4+ cell populations was evaluated by immune-phenotyping using twocolour antibody panels. Data were acquired and analysed using the Cyan ADP Analyzer
(Summit 4.3, Beckman Coulter). T cell population purity was 94.9% (SD 3.1). For a more
detailed description of T cell isolation and flow cytometry, see Reinius et al. (29)

DNA extraction, bisulphite treatment and DNA methylation measurements using the 450K
Beadchip Array
Genomic DNA was isolated from T cell pellets using the QiAmp DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration was measured
using the Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen). Bisulphite treatment was performed with the EZ-96 DNA
Methylation Kit (Zymo Research) and DNA methylation measurements were done using the
Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip Array (450k array, Illumina). Samples
were analysed in two batches as part of a larger project investigating the epigenetic effects in
individuals treated with DEX during fetal life (30) and in individuals with CAH who also
receive treatment with glucocorticoids postnatally. Samples from individuals with CAH,
prenatally treated participants and controls were distributed randomly on the arrays. Technical
validation of the 450k arrays was performed using bisulphite pyrosequencing in the study
investigating the effects of prenatal DEX given during the first trimester (30) and technical
validation was thus not performed again in the present investigation.

DNA Methylation quality control and data processing
The 450k array was used to determine DNA methylation levels at 480 000 CGs
across the genome. The data analysis was performed in R and raw data were pre-processed
using the lumi package (31,32). Three samples (all controls) were discarded during the quality

control phase because of poor genome-wide correlation with other samples and an aberrant
distribution of β values. In addition, the following probes were excluded during the preprocessing of the analysis: (i) probes located on the Y and X chromosomes, (ii) probes with a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within three base pairs of the interrogated
CpG site in order to exclude false positive probes caused by genetic variations and (iii) CpG
probes with poor detection p-values (p>0.01) (33).
After filtering, 395 462 probes remained. Estimations of β values for the probes
were performed using a previously described three-step pipeline (34). Batch effects were
identified and their effect quantified using principal component analysis. Batch effects were
subsequently corrected using the ComBat function from the sva Bioconductor package (35).
Finally, based on the assumption that most of the CAH-associated DNA methylation changes
would be relatively small and that, while using all available samples, our sample size of
patients and controls is limited, we choose to analyse highly variable probes; we selected
probes whose interquartile range, after transforming β values into M values (32,36), was >0.5.
As a result, we selected 29 351 CpG sites for the association analysis.

DNA methylation differential analysis
Two analyses were conducted to study the association between DNA
methylation and CAH. In the first analysis a linear model was generated for each CpG site for
which the predictive variables for DNA methylation were group (CAH-DEX or CAH), age,
sex and group interaction with sex (CAH-DEX x sex) to investigate methylation between
prenatally treated patients with CAH vs. those with CAH not prenatally treated. The analysis
and linear models were generated separately for each sex due to the difference in treatment
length. In the second analysis a similar methodology was applied but included only patients
with CAH not prenatally treated and population controls. To estimate the significance of each

CpG site for each respective analysis we computed a permutation-based p-value in which 10
000 permutations were performed over the M-values for all CpG sites. A false discovery rate
(FDR) was computed using a non-parametric method described elsewhere (37). CpGs with a
FDR <0.05 were considered significant.

DNA methylation quantitative trait analysis
We further sought to investigate the correlations between methylation and
participant phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype. Phenotype groups were defined and ranked by
severity as control, SV CAH and SW CAH to create three groups for the correlation analysis.
Genotypes were grouped based on the severity of the mildest mutated CYP21A2 allele to
create four groups for the correlation analysis. The groups were defined and ranked as wt
(control), B (n=10, p.I172N), A (n=10, G291S, p.R356Q and I2 Splice) and null (n=7, no
enzyme activity, including complete gene deletion, I7 Splice and p.R356W). The genetic
status of the controls was not known but their mildest allele was assumed to be wt . Only
patients with CAH not exposed to prenatal DEX were included in this analysis. One NC
patient was excluded in that the NC phenotypic group included only this single patient.
Next, confounding effects of sex and age were regressed out from the
methylation data using a linear model and the residual values obtained after correction were
applied for correlation to either phenotype or genotype using Spearman’s non-parametric
correlation. To estimate the significance of each CpG site for each respective analysis we
computed a permutation-based p-value in which 10 000 permutations were performed over
the residuals from the linear model corrected for sex and age. We selected significant CpG
sites whose correlation between methylation levels and phenotype or genotype had a FDR of
<0.05.

Analyses of patient outcomes
Group analysis of height, weight, BMI, glucose homeostasis, blood lipids and
cognitive performance was performed using multiple linear regressions with CAH, age, sex
and the CAH x sex interaction as predictors where appropriate (excluding age for cognition as
the data were already age-corrected). We also performed non-parametric correlations to
investigate the relationship between patient phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype with metabolic
and cognitive outcome. The correlation analyses were performed by correcting metabolic
outcome data for age and sex and cognitive data for sex in a linear model. The residual values
obtained after correction were applied for correlation to either phenotype or genotype using
Spearman’s non-parametric correlation.
Associations between methylation and previously described clinical outcomes
were performed using multiple linear regressions with β-values, age, sex and β-values x sex
interaction as predictors (again excluding age for cognitive outcome data). Associations with
a nominal p<0.05 were considered significant for all analyses. All statistical analyses were
performed in R.

Results
Differential methylation analysis
No significant CpG sites were identified in the analysis investigating the effect
of prenatal DEX treatment or in the analysis comparing CAH patients with controls.

DNA methylation quantitative trait analyses
In the quantitative trait analyses phenotype correlated significantly with two
CpG sites: cg18486102 (rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.027) and cg02404636 (rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.038). cg02404636 also significantly correlated with genotype (rho=0.59, adjusted -

p=0.024). Methylation (β-values) for both CpGs increased with the severity of the disease
(genotype and phenotype) (Figure 1A and C).
The site cg18486102 is located in a CpG island in the transcriptional start site
(TSS200) of the FAIM2 gene on chromosome 12. It also overlaps with a DNase1
hypersensitive site and the epigenomic marks H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 (Figure 1B and D).
Moreover , when relating β-values for cg18486102 to the daily dose of glucocorticoids, there
was a significant interaction between dose (HC equivalent dose [mg/m2]) and sex (β=0.04,
F(3,58)=2.1, p=0.02). The CpG site cg02404636 is located in the TSS1500 of the SFI1 gene
on chromosome 22. It also appeared to be located in a small epigenomic hotspot enriched for
various histone modifications and a DNase1 hypersensitive site (Figure 1D). There was no
association between dose and methylation for cg02404636. Genomic locations for the
markers were acquired from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project using data from CD4+ T-cells
(http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/).

Clinical outcome and association with DNA methylation
We identified higher levels of serum C-peptide in patients with CAH (β=0.2,
F(4,56)=3.1, p=0.044). Additionally, levels of C-peptide and HbA1c were positively
correlated with patient phenotype (rho=0.261, p=0.044 and rho=0.274, p=0.034) and
genotype (rho=0.265, p=0.044 and rho=0.281, p=0.033), respectively (Table 2).
Using the β-values as predictors, we investigated the association between DNA
methylation of cg18486102 and cg02404636 and patient outcomes. In general, no significant
associations were identified, except for the methylation of CpG cg02404636, which showed a
significant interaction with the sex-of-participant variable and fasting plasma HDL cholesterol
levels (β=2.4, F(4,57)=2.3, p=0.035).

Discussion
We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation in peripheral CD4+ T cells in
patients with CAH to elucidate whether epigenomic reprogramming occurs. We also studied
the association between patient outcome and DNA methylation. In addition, we investigated
DNA methylation in a small group of patients with CAH who were exposed to prenatal DEX
therapy to identify if there is an imprinting effect that may affect the long-term health. We
choose the T cell because it is easily accessible and to minimise confounding effects from
having a mix of cells with different methylation profiles. The T cell can be used to study the
effects on this cell type per se, but also as a model system to study mechanisms or events that
may occur in other cell types during embryogenesis and during postnatal development (38).
Moreover, we have previously observed broad associations between differences in DNA
methylation in peripheral CD4+ T-cells between controls and individuals treated with DEX
during the first trimester but not having CAH (25).
No significant associations were identified for either CAH or prenatal DEX
treatment for T cell methylation in patients with CAH. This is contradictory in light of our
previous study where we observed broad associations with DEX in the CD4+ T-cell
methylome in CAH unaffected individuals (25). In our previous study we identified broad
differences between treated individuals and controls that were mainly associated with immune
functioning and inflammation (25). One reason for the lack of association with DEX in the
present investigation could be the small sample size. On comparing methylation between
CAH patients and controls, we did not observe a main effect of CAH per se. This finding is in
itself important as this is a patient group with a lifelong chronic disorder that requires lifelong
treatment and includes risks for several co-morbidities.
However, we did identify significant positive correlations with phenotype and
genotype in two CpG sites located in the TSS of two genes, FAIM2 (cg18486102) and SFI1

(cg02404636 ) (Figure 1A and C), where hypermethylation was associated with a more severe
genotype and phenotype. Both CpG sites were located in regions overlapping with several
epigenetic markers (Figure 1B and D). The CpG cg18486102 overlapped with a CpG island
and a DNase1 hypersensitive site and with a region enriched for two histone modifications
(H3K4me2 and H3K4me3). These two histone modifications are markers of actively
transcribed promotors and transcription factor binding sites (39,40). The CpG cg02404636
also overlapped with a DNase1 hypersensitive site and was located near a CpG island. The
differentially methylated CpG also overlapped with regions enriched with a large number of
histone modifications (Figure 1D). Furthermore, investigating both cg18486102 and
cg02404636 using Ensambl (http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html) we observed that they
were located in promoters active in CD4+ T cells.
Importantly, while cg18486102 was filtered based on FDR, it was among the
top most significant CpG probes correlating with genotype (rho=0.54, p<0.0001, adjusted
p=0.153) and the most significant probe in the comparison between patients and controls
(t=4.86, p<0.0001, adjusted p=0.315). Furthermore, the finding that both CpGs seemed to be
consistently significant, or among the top probes, for both phenotype and genotype is in line
with the observation that there is a good genotype-phenotype correlation for CAH (2).
In our cohort of patients with CAH we did not observe any cognitive deficits
when compared with controls. However, patients with CAH showed significantly higher
plasma concentrations of C-peptide. We also found positive correlations between C-peptide
and HbA1c levels with the severity of patient genotype or phenotype (Table 2). These results
indicate that patients with a more severe CYP21A2 mutation and clinical phenotype may be
more susceptible to insulin resistance. Thus, we provide evidence that the severity of the
disorder is associated with affected glucose homeostasis consistent with the published
evidence (7,8,12). FAIM2 is a widely expressed membrane-associated protein with very high

expression in the brain compared to other tissues (41,42). It has mainly been described as an
anti-apoptotic protein protecting neurons from Fas ligand activated apoptosis (43,44). We
suggest that hypermethylation of cg18486102 in the TSS of FAIM2 could result in neurons
being more sensitive to apoptosis, reductions in axonal growth, or both. In a case-control
study of brain morphology in patients with CAH the authors identified widespread reductions
in white matter structural integrity and reductions of volumes in several brain regions (45).
Moreover, SNPs in FAIM2 have been associated with obesity and in another study of the
FAIM2 promotor methylation, several CpG sites were significantly associated with
dyslipidaemia (46-48). These results are consistent with our hypothesis on metabolic
abnormalities in patients with CAH. One plausible reason for not finding a significant
association with any metabolic or cognitive measure could be the small sample size given that
there are several p-values in the 0.05-0.1 range (Table 3). Our preliminary data indicate that
there indeed is a relationship between brain structure and methylation in patients with CAH
(van’t Westeinde et al, unpublished data) since we have identified a positive association
between FAIM2 methylation and surface area of the medial occipito-temporal and lingual
sulcus (van’t Westeinde et al, unpublished data). This might be an indication that differential
methylation in FAIM2 could affect the developmental trajectory of the brain in patients with
CAH. Moreover, we also identified a significant interaction between GC dose (HC equivalent
dose [mg/m2]) and sex with higher doses predicting higher methylation. This might indicate
an effect from overtreatment when attempting to suppress androgens in women with CAH.
SFI1 is a centrin-binding protein involved in centrosome maturation and cell
cycle progression and mitosis and is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body (49-51). The
hypermethylation of the TSS region of SFI1 could possibly (if the methylation leads to
decreased expression) interfere with tissue development by interfering with cell
differentiation and proliferation. We identified a significant interaction between CpG

methylation of SFI1 and sex of participant, with higher plasma concentrations of HDL
cholesterol in girls. The mechanism as to how and why this gene would influence blood lipid
levels, however, is not known and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution.

Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First, because our sample size is relatively
small, it is possible that we failed to detect small effects, particularly for rate outcomes (false
negative). This issue is in part supported by the finding that several p-values in the between
group comparisons on metabolic and cognitive outcome and the association with methylation
are between 0.05-0.1, suggesting that the lack of power could be attributed to small sample
size. A potential confounding factor is that we included children who may not develop any
metabolic or cognitive sequelae until later in life, or it may simply be that there are no real
differences in these data. However, our study benefits from a very unique cohort of patients
from which data on a large array of variables have been acquired, including the genetic status
of patients together with outcome parameters. This unfortunately also means that there is a
lack of additional cohorts for validation at this point in time and limits the possibility for
meaningful meta-analyses. Furthermore, we cannot infer any direct conclusions of
hypermethylation in FAIM2 and SFI1 TSSs on gene expression because of the lack of RNA
expression data, but we do know that TSS hypermethylation is typically associated with
transcriptional silencing. In addition, the results are strengthened by the fact that both CpGs
are located in promoters that are active in CD4+ T cells.

Conclusion
This is the first analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation in patients with
CAH. We identified two CpGs (cg18486102 and cg02404636) located in the TSS region of

the genes FAIM2 (cg18486102) and SFI1 (cg02404636) that were associated with the severity
of the clinical CAH phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype. In light of the long-term metabolic
and cognitive sequelae patients with CAH are at risk of, both genes should be considered
biologically relevant. Although we did not observe a direct association between methylation
and metabolic or cognitive outcome, differential methylation in their respective TSS region
may still have important implications for the long-term outcome in patients with CAH.
Further studies on larger cohorts in addition to functional studies are needed to determine
whether the identified alterations affect the health of the individual.
