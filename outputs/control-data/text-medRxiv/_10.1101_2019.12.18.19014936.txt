Background: The postpartum hospital stay is a unique opportunity for clinicians to educate parents on the importance of
promoting early child development. Pediatricians are well positioned to address both medical and developmental concerns
during critical periods of development, yet very few parenting
interventions are led by pediatricians. Aims: To assess the impact of a novel one-hour long pediatrician-led Newborn Class
on maternal knowledge, confidence, and anxiety. Methods: We
conducted a nonrandomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the Newborn Class. First-time mothers who delivered a full-term singleton vaginally with no major complications and attended the class were recruited. Mothers who expressed a desire to attend the class but were discharged before a
class was offered served as controls. Outcome measures: Maternal self-perceived anxiety and confidence were measured using
standardized scales (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults
and Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale). Knowledge on newborn care was assessed using a novel scale. Results: A total of
84 participants (intervention n=36, control n=48) were included
in the study. Mothers who attended class showed significantly
higher levels of knowledge compared to the control group as well
as significantly higher parenting confidence levels. No change
was observed in the overall level of anxiety. Conclusions: A
short pediatrician-led parenting intervention can be an effective
tool in improving maternal confidence and newborn care knowledge. Given the importance of the newborn period in establishing healthy developmental trajectories, this cost- and timeeffective intervention could be widely implemented to promote
early strong mother-infant relationships that foster healthy development.

Introduction
Experiences during sensitive periods of development provide
scaffolding for a child’s physical, cognitive and behavioral
health trajectories (1). During the first years of life, the brain
undergoes rapid development and is most vulnerable to external experiences (2). Responsive relationships with caregivers are essential for optimal development, as reflected in
better executive functioning (3), better attention (both short

term and later in life) (4)(5), fewer addictive behaviors (6),
and lower risks of cardiovascular disease in adulthood (7).
The verbal stimulation associated with responsive caregiving is positively associated with children’s language skills
(8)(9). Responsive parenting can also buffer against the detrimental effects of early childhood adversity, which include
poorer cognitive and socio-emotional development (10)(11)
and worse health and behavioral outcomes in adulthood, such
as obesity and drug use (12)(13).
Specific behaviors of caregivers have been identified
as responsive parenting. These include consistent responsiveness, sensitivity to distress, verbal scaffolding, and autonomy support (14)(15)(16)(17). Numerous parenting interventions promoting responsive parenting behaviors have
been designed, implemented and evaluated. Meta-analysis
of existing interventions shows large variations in methods
of delivery (group versus individual), class setting (primary
care setting versus community setting), intensity (frequency
and duration), cost, and class instructors (18)(19). Although
comparisons of class effectiveness have not been made for
different methods of delivery, longer interventions were associated with increased parental confidence. Financial and
staffing challenges have led to the increased use of pediatric
primary care setting as the site for intervention due to its established infrastructure and the already well-attended wellchild visits (20)(21); however, very few of them are taught
by pediatricians. Yet, pediatricians are uniquely suited to address both medical and developmental topics. Not only do
pediatricians have access to children and their families at critical developmental timepoints, but research has shown that
parental behaviors, such as daily reading and breast feeding,
are more likely to be carried out by parents if they are encouraged by a pediatrician (22). Pediatricians are thus ideally
positioned to positively affect the mother-infant relationship
(23).
Within this context, the Mount Sinai Parenting Center developed the Newborn Parent Education and Discharge
Class (hereafter referred to as the Newborn Class). The class
is one-hour long, taught by pediatric attendings and residents,
and offered at no-cost to families in the Well Baby Nursery

(WBN) at Mount Sinai Hospital. With 98.39% of babies in
the U.S. born in hospitals (24), postpartum stay in the hospital is a unique opportunity for clinicians to educate parents on the importance of promoting early child development.
Parents are encouraged to attend the Newborn Class during
the mother’s postpartum hospital stay. The class covers both
medical topics, such as safe sleep, feeding and bathing, as
well as developmental topics, such as language development,
responsive parenting, and soothing a baby. The class is in addition to the individualized discharge instructions provided
by the clinical staff. The Newborn Class aims to promote
strong mother-child relationships and increase the skills and
support of mothers, with the goal of positively impacting a
child’s developmental trajectory.
Currently, the class is offered two to three times per
week based on available resources. Here, we present initial data on the effectiveness of the Newborn Class on several maternal outcomes at time of discharge. To evaluate
the effectiveness of the Newborn Class, a non-randomized
controlled trial was implemented. Mothers who attended the
Newborn Class were asked to participate in a questionnairebased survey at the time of discharge, one day after attending
the class. Because the class is available only on certain days
of the week, it is inaccessible to a subpopulation of mothers who would attend if it were available. These mothers
were case-matched to serve as the controls for the intervention group. Post-intervention knowledge was quantified using a scale developed to specifically target components taught
in the Newborn Class. In addition to knowledge, parenting
behaviors are strongly affected by parental anxiety and selfefficacy (25)(26)(27). These are commonly assessed measures of parenting intervention for which many validated and
standardized scales exist (28). Scales included in the study
were chosen to minimize participants’ time commitment.

Methods
2.1.

Ethics Statement. The study was conducted in
accordance with Mount Sinai’s Institutional Review Board
(IRB). Because no personal identifiers were collected during
the trial, it qualified for IRB exempt status. Trial registration:
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04121390.

2.2.

Study Design. The study was conducted at the
Klingenstein Pavilion of Mount Sinai Hospital located in
New York, NY. Mothers who desired to attend the Newborn Class were self-selected into control and intervention
group based on whether a class was available during their
postpartum stay. For the intervention group, a research
assistant collected the room numbers of mothers who
attended the class. Another research assistant screened for
eligible participants and recruited them into the study the
next morning, prior to discharge. During the remaining
days of the week, mothers were screened and recruited
into the control group on the morning of their discharge.
Immediately after recruitment and consent, participants in
both groups took part in a 10-minute survey measuring

the primary outcomes of the study which include anxiety
level, confidence level and newborn care knowledge. The
study consent form and surveys are provided in Appendix A.

2.3. Subjects. Mothers were recruited between May, 2018,

and August, 2019. Inclusion criteria included: 1) first-time
mother, 2) above 18 years old, 3) vaginal delivery of a
healthy full-term singleton, 4) no major perinatal complications (per self-report), 5) English-speaking, and 6) consent
to participate. These inclusion criteria were designed to
control for known factors associated with parental anxiety
and confidence (29)(30).

2.4.

The intervention. The Newborn Class is taught in
the lounge of the Well Baby Nursery (WBN). On days the
class is taught, parents receive reminders through overhead
announcements and from nurses and residents. The class
is open to all parents. All parents in the WBN, regardless
of whether or not they attend the class, are given links
to online videos with demonstrations by pediatricians at
Mount Sinai covering similar topics to what is taught in the
Newborn Class. Parents who attend the class are given an
additional packet of written information summarizing the
topics covered in the Newborn Class.
The class begins by addressing the importance of brain
development in the newborn period. Important concepts
such as language development, parentese (talking to the baby
using a singsong voice with words that are sophisticated and
grammatically correct), sports casting (describing actions
verbally to the baby) and labeling (commenting on the baby’s
actions and reactions to what is happening around them) are
explained and demonstrated by the pediatrician. The idea
of responsive parenting is thoroughly described and demonstrated to the parents. The class then addresses common
how-to medical questions: feeding frequency and amount;
bowel movements and urination; burping and spitting up;
umbilical cord care and bathing; diapering and circumcision
care; skin and fingernail care; keeping baby from getting
sick; colic and soothing the baby; and the importance of
sleep and safe sleep habits. The pediatrician also addresses
Baby Blues and Postpartum Depression, emphasizing the
importance of support during the postpartum period. Finally,
the pediatrician also reviews normal physical findings and
exam findings from head to toe, and discusses when to
call the doctor. The entire class is interactive and utilizes
accessories, such as a doll, diapers, and a tub, to demonstrate
concepts. Parents are encouraged to ask questions at any
point in time.

newborn care, anxiety levels and confidence levels between
the intervention and control groups. The survey took 10
minutes to administer. Anxiety level was measured first
to minimize confounding effects of study participation on
maternal anxiety. Parenting confidence was then measured,
followed by knowledge. Basic demographic information
such as the mother’s age, education level and race were
collected at the end of the survey. Given the availability of
many parenting interventions, we also asked if the mother
had received other interventions outside of Mount Sinai.
In the intervention group, mothers were also asked if they
found the Newborn Class to be useful. Qualitative comments
of what was and was not helpful were also elicited. The
survey and answer key for the knowledge scale are provided
in Appendix A.
2.5.1. Maternal anxiety
Parental anxiety is a common measure of the well-being of
mothers and a predictor of parenting behaviors. A widely
used instrument for measuring anxiety levels is the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-AD) (31)(32)(33).
This self-administered scale was constructed by Spielberger
et al (34) and has been translated into more than 30 languages
for use in cross-cultural clinical studies. The scale differentiates between temporary “state anxiety” and more enduring
“trait anxiety”. State anxiety is more responsive to change
and thus a better measure of immediate post-intervention
effect of the class. Given the overwhelming burdens the
participants already have as new mothers, we aimed to limit
the overall survey time. Therefore, only the state anxiety
portion of the scale was used for the study, which consists
of 20 brief statements describing how the participants feel
at that moment in time. 10 items reflected positive states
(e.g. I feel calm; I feel satisfied), and 10 items reflected
negative states (e.g. I feel anxious; I feel indecisive). Four
response options were given: (1) not at all; (2) somewhat;
(3) moderately so; and (4) very much so. Mothers completed
this portion of the survey independently. The possible range
of scores is 10-40, with higher scores indicating higher levels
of anxiety. License to reproduce the scale was purchased
from the official distributor of STAI-AD, Mind Garden, Inc.
and can be found in Appendix C.
2.5.2. Maternal confidence
Maternal confidence was measured using the standardized
Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale (KPCS), a scale developed for mothers or fathers of infants aged 0-12 months
(35) and commonly used in parent-child intervention studies
(36)(37)(38). The scale consists of 15 statements that are
task-specific. Four response options were given: (1) hardly
ever; (2) not very often; (3) some of the time; and (4) most
of the time. The possible range of score is 0-45, with higher
scores associated with higher levels of confidence. This
scale was administered in the style of an interview, which is
consistent with how the scale was developed and intended
to be used. Participants were given a laminated card with
the four response options, and each statement was read out

Gozali et al.

loud by the research assistant. Since many of the statements
refer to parent-child interactions that mothers who just gave
birth would not have had (e.g., taking care of a sick child),
the research assistant asked the participants to answer these
statements according to how confident they would feel if
they were asked to carry out these actions now. Permission
to use the scale was obtained from the Karitane Education
Department and the scale can be found in its original format
in Appendix D.
2.5.3. Maternal newborn care knowledge
Assessment of maternal knowledge on newborn care is
commonly conducted using intervention-specific scales (39).
Therefore, a newborn care knowledge scale specifically
targeting topics taught in the Newborn Class was developed
by a team of 3 pediatricians and 2 specialists at Mount Sinai.
The test consists of 10 true or false questions, covering both
medical and developmental topics consistently covered in
the Newborn Class. The score ranges from 0-10, with higher
scores indicative of higher levels of parenting knowledge.
This scale was also administered through interview and an
“answer key” was provided to the parents at the end of the
survey. The knowledge scale and answer key can be found
in Appendix A.

2.6. Statistical analysis. Distribution of participant char-

acteristics within and between the control and intervention
groups were analyzed using linear regression analysis and χ2
tests, respectively. Primary outcome measures were knowledge, anxiety and confidence, and are reported as means after adjusting for the influence of covariates. STAI-AD consists of both positive and negative state items, and each state
was also analyzed separately. Mean differences between control and intervention group were compared using two-tailed
T-tests. Effect sizes for each of the three primary outcomes
were carried out using Hedge’s g to indicate the magnitude of
difference between intervention and control group. Hedge’s g
is a measure of standardized mean difference often used with
pretest posttest designs (40). Interpretation of effect sizes
from a Hedge’s g test was compared to that of Cohen’s d,
a similar test for larger sample sizes. For Cohen’s d, effect
sizes between 0.2 and 0.3 are considered small, medium if
between 0.4 and 0.7, and large if over 0.8 (41). Correlations
between the primary outcomes were analyzed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient test. STAI-AD and KPCS
are both standardized scales with normalized data, and both
have validated clinically-severe cut-offs. A secondary outcome of the study was therefore to quantify the difference in
proportion of mothers scoring in the clinically-severe ranges
between control and intervention groups. A two-tailed Zscore test for two population proportions was carried out to
compare the proportions in the two groups. For the knowledge test, an additional two-tailed Z-score test was carried
out to compare differences in scores between developmental
questions versus medical questions across the two groups.

Table 1. Demographic characteristics. Basic demographic data collected from
participants included age, highest level of education, race (white versus non-white)
and ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic). Chi-square analysis showed no significant differences were observed in any demographics between the intervention
and control groups. Data are given as n (%).
Fig. 1. Consort Diagram. Flowchart showing the flow of participants through each
stage of the trial. Three-hundred-and-sixty mothers were approached for the study.
Out of the 89 mothers who met the inclusion criteria for the study, 5 declined to
be in the study, 48 were included in the control group and 36 were included in the
intervention group.

Results
3.1. Participant flow. A total of 360 mothers were screened

for eligibility. Eighty-nine met all the inclusion criteria, but 5
mothers declined to take part in the survey. Of the 84 enrolled
mothers, 36 (42.9%) were in the intervention group and 48
(57.1%) were in the control group. The consort flow diagram
of the study participants is in Figure 1.
3.2.

Demographic data. The mean (SD) age was 32.0
(4.34) years. Participants primarily self-identified as white
(78.6%, n=66) and non-Hispanic (96.4%, n=81). Also, most
participants were highly educated, reporting a master’s degree or higher (58.3%, n=49); only 6.0% reported high school
diploma or below (n=5). However, chi-square analysis of
the distribution of demographics showed no significant differences between control and intervention group (Table 1).
Table 2 shows identified associations between demographic
data and the three primary outcomes. As expected, there was
a significant association between age and knowledge (Linear
regression, R2 = 0.047, P = 0.049), with older individuals
scoring better. However, age was not significantly associated
with either confidence or anxiety. We also found a significant association between race and anxiety (Linear regression,
R2 = 0.079, P = 0.010), with white participants exhibiting
higher anxiety than non-white participants. Confidence was
not associated with any demographic characteristic.
3.3. Primary outcomes. See Table 3.

3.3.1. Knowledge
Mothers who attended the Newborn Class showed significantly higher levels of newborn care knowledge than
participants in the control group (Two-tailed T-test, mean

[SD], 8.08 [1.06] vs 6.78 [1.25]; P<0.001). A large effect
size of 1.11 was observed when comparing the two groups.
3.3.2. Confidence
A significantly higher level of confidence was observed for
mothers in the intervention group compared to those in the
control group (Two-tailed T-test, mean [SD], 39.31 [3.88]
vs 35.20 [3.99]; P<0.001). A large effect size of 1.03 was
observed.
3.3.3. Anxiety
Although the intervention group showed lower maternal
anxiety level, this difference was not statistically significant
(Two-tailed T-test, mean [SD], 35.50 [8.73] vs 38.5 [9.53];
P=0.164).
3.4. Positive versus negative state-items on the anxiety scale. The STAI-AD(S) contains 20 brief statements

describing how the participants feel at that moment in time.
10 items reflect positive states (e.g. I feel calm; I feel
satisfied), and 10 items reflect negative states (e.g. I feel
anxious; I feel indecisive). To evaluate if our intervention
might preferentially target only one of these two types of
states, we analyzed the scores of positive and negative state
items separately. We found that although the intervention
and control groups did not show an overall difference in
maternal anxiety level, a statistically significant difference

Table 3. Differences in knowledge, confidence and anxiety in control versus
intervention mothers. Mothers in the intervention group exhibited significantly
higher newborn care knowledge and confidence but no difference in overall anxiety. Interestingly, when the STAI-AD(S) items were separated into “positive” versus “negative” states, intervention mothers did show lower scores in positive state
items, which translates to higher positive emotions such as “feeling calm”. Effect
sizes were measured using Hedges’ g and compared to standardized Cohen d’s
effect sizes used in similar studies; small effect: Hedge’s g between 0.2 and 0.3,
medium effect: Hedge’s g between 0.4 and 0.7, large effect: Hedge’s g >0.8.

did emerge when the positive and negative state items were
analyzed separately (Table 3). Specifically, the intervention
group scored significantly lower on positive state items
compared to the control group (Two-tailed T-test, mean
[SD], 18.00 [4.77] vs 20.68 [5.28]; P=0.026). Because the
STAI-AD(S) scores positive versus negative state items
in opposing direction (higher score for reported negative
items and lower score for reported positive items), this
suggests that mothers in the intervention group felt more
“calm” and “satisfied” without changes in “anxiety” and
“indecisiveness”. A medium effect of 0.53 was observed
for the positive state items. No significant difference was
observed for the negative state items (Two-tailed T-test,
mean [SD], 17.28 [4.64] vs 17.80 [4.95]; P=0.642).

3.5. Clinically severe ranges for anxiety and confidence levels. The STAI-AD (S) and KPCS can be used to

detect clinically severe and moderate levels of anxiety and
confidence derived from distributions of normalized data. A
cutoff of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms for the STAI-AD (S) (42)(43). A moderate
clinical range for KPCS is defined as scores between 31-35,
and a severe clinical range as scores less than 31 (33). Twotailed Z-score tests for two population proportions were used
to compare the differences in proportion of mothers scoring
in the clinically severe and moderate ranges between the intervention group and control group. About twice as many
mothers in the control group scored in the clinically moderate
KPCS range as compared to the intervention group (19.4%
in intervention group versus 40.0% in control group, Twotailed Z-score=-1.99, P=0.047). There was also a trend toward a decreased in incidence of mothers meeting clinically
severe ranges for KPCS in the intervention group, though
this decrease did not reach significance (2.8% in intervention
group versus 15.5% in control group, Two-tailed Z-score=1.84, P=0.066). The rates of clinically severe range scores
in STAI-AD(S) did not differ significantly (30.6% in the intervention group versus 47.5% in control group, Two-tailed
Z-score=-1.51, P=0.131). Outcomes from the two-tailed Zscore tests for anxiety and confidence are reported in Table
4.

Table 4. Proportions of participants scoring in clinical ranges for the KPCS
and STAI-AD(S). A significantly lower proportion of mothers in the intervention
group scored in the clinically moderate range of the KPCS. No group differences
were observed in proportions of participants scoring in clinically severe ranges of
the KPCS and STAI-AD(S).

Table 5. Correlations between primary outcomes. Control and intervention
mothers showed similar profiles in correlations between primary outcomes. Knowledge did not correlate with either confidence or anxiety in either group. Consistent
with prior studies, confidence was inversely related to anxiety and this relationship
was similar in both intervention and control groups.

3.6. Correlations between primary outcomes. To assess potential associations among knowledge, anxiety and
confidence, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated
within each group between primary outcomes. Significant
negative correlations between anxiety and confidence were
observed in both groups (Control group: Pearson correlation
r=-0.699, p<0.001; Intervention group: Pearson correlation
r=-0.650, p<0.001). However, knowledge was not correlated
with anxiety or confidence in either group, and it is therefore an unlikely mediator of the higher confidence scores observed in the intervention group.
3.7. Differences in effect sizes on medical versus developmental newborn care topics. The Newborn Class

was designed to cover both medical and developmental issues. The knowledge test created for this study thus includes questions that assess knowledge in both areas. To investigate if particular topics were preferentially retained by
the mothers who attended the Newborn Class, differences
in the proportion of correct answers was investigated for
each question. Significantly higher proportion of mothers
in the intervention group correctly answered three medicaltype questions (Two-tailed Z-score test, Z=2.95, P=0.003;
Z=2.95, P=0.016; Z=3.74, P<0.001) and one developmentaltype question (Two-tailed Z-score test, Z=2.88, P=0.004) correctly. Results from the Z-score test are reported in Table 6.

Discussion
In this nonrandomized controlled trial, we found that mothers who attended a pediatrician-led Newborn Class during
their postpartum hospital stay scored significantly higher in
knowledge and parenting confidence compared to mothers in

Table 6. Knowledge scale. The knowledge test was specifically designed to assess concepts consistently covered in the Newborn Class. The test consisted of ten
“true” (T) or “false” (F) type statements, six of which assessed developmental-type
knowledge (D) and four of which assessed medical-type knowledge (M). Correct
answers are shown in parenthesis following each statement. Proportion of mothers
in control versus intervention groups correctly answering each knowledge question
was compared using Two-tailed Z-score tests for two populations. The intervention
significantly improved the knowledge of a total of four questions, one of which was
developmental-type and three of which were medical-type.

the control group. The intervention was associated with a
large effect size in both knowledge and confidence. Interestingly, while the overall anxiety score did not differ between
the two groups, a significantly lower anxiety score was observed in the intervention group for the positive state items
of STAI-AD (S). Lower score in the positive anxiety items
translates to improved positive emotions (examples of positive emotion in the STAI-AD(S) are feeling “at ease”, “satisfied” and “relaxed”). Conceivably, improved knowledge
about caring for their baby enhanced positive emotions of
mothers in the intervention group without decreasing negative emotions (examples of negative emotions in the STAIAD(S) are feeling “upset”, “tense” and “nervous”). Overall,
our data indicate that a one hour-long pediatrician-led parenting intervention is effective in changing several outcomes
associated with positive parenting.
It is important to consider that the control group had
access to the same information as the intervention group on
Mount Sinai’s online video database. While the study did not
directly evaluate the number of mothers in the control group
that had accessed these videos at the time of survey administration, our data clearly point to the importance of direct
physician-mother interaction. During the Newborn Class, the
teaching pediatrician conveys the information in an engaging
manner through live demonstrations. The pediatrician also
encourages parents to ask questions and engages them in conversation.
One of the inclusion criteria for the control group was

answering positively to the intent to attend the class if it
were available during the mother’s postpartum stay. Therefore, a potential selection bias could have arisen from the
apprehensive-participant role, in which participants answer
positively to please the researcher (43). It is unlikely however, that selection bias explains the entirety of the observed variance. Differences were observed in confidence
and knowledge, which are directly targeted in the Newborn
Class, but were not significant in levels of overall anxiety,
which is not the focus of the class. The well-described inverse relationship between confidence and anxiety previously
observed in the literature (44)(45)(46) was replicated here,
and was of similar magnitude for both the intervention and
the control groups. Additionally, the lack of correlation between knowledge – which measures topics specific to the
Newborn Class – and either confidence or anxiety in either
group, argues against a direct mediating effect of acquired
knowledge on the higher confidence level in the intervention group. More likely, this improvement in confidence is
mediated by direct physician-mother interaction. Finally, the
overall similarity in demographics and similar profiles in the
correlations between primary outcomes in control versus intervention groups, also argue against selection bias as a major
contributor to the main effects observed in the intervention
group. Nevertheless, an important future step for the verification of the effectiveness of the Newborn Class will be to conduct a randomized clinical trial, and/or pre-/post-intervention
measures.
A surprising finding was the larger effect on medical
over developmental knowledge. Developmental concerns are
generally less addressed by pediatricians (47). Given the
tremendous importance of promoting healthy brain development for establishing developmental trajectories, addressing
these topics is of fundamental importance in pediatrics. With
this in mind, the Newborn Class was designed to teach parents both medical and developmental topics regarding the
care for their children. Therefore, we expected the unique
emphasis on developmental issues to be reflected in selective
increase in knowledge of these topics. However, we found
the opposite: the class significantly enhanced the knowledge
of three out of four medical topics but only one out of six
developmental topics. A possible explanation for this is the
larger knowledge deficit of developmental topics among new
mothers. A well described phenomenon in human memory is
that retention of new information is dependent on the number
of times the information is encountered (48). Because medical concerns are more widely known, preexisting awareness
of these topics might make it easier to consolidate the information during the Newborn Class. If so, it is imperative that
we design methods to repeatedly remind parents of their important role in promoting their baby’s brain development.
Limitations. This is an initial evaluation of the immediate

Assessing a pediatrician-led newborn parenting class

immediate effects can be sustained will require longitudinal
follow-up studies. Because of our strict inclusion/exclusion
criteria, which were designed to increase validity in a study
with relatively small sample size, it is currently unknown
if the findings will generalize to e.g. multiparous mothers, mothers who experienced complications during the pregnancy, and mothers who delivered via cesarean section. Furthermore, this study only assesses the effect of the Newborn Class on mothers. Fathers play a key role in parenting
and significantly influence a child’s developmental trajectory
(49)(50). Since the Newborn Class is taught to both parents,
future studies evaluating the effect of the intervention on the
fathers will be imperative. Additionally, our sample population was predominately white, educated, older mothers. This
surprising and unintentional selection bias was likely a consequence of the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and might
further limit the generalizability of our findings. However, it
should be noted that there was no significant difference in the
demographics of the intervention and control groups. Therefore, at least in this population, our findings are likely meaningful. Most importantly, the ability of interventions, such as
the Newborn Class, to actually alter developmental outcomes
of babies will need to be evaluated in future studies.

Conclusions
This study is the first to evaluate the Newborn Class at Mount
Sinai Hospital. Results shows that this short pediatrician-led
parenting intervention taught during the mothers’ postpartum
stay in the hospital can be effective in significantly increasing maternal knowledge on newborn care and maternal confidence level. The Newborn Class can be easily implemented
into other postpartum settings. Further research is needed
to assess the long-term effects of the Newborn Class and the
role of mothers’ confidence and knowledge on optimizing the
developmental trajectories of their children.
