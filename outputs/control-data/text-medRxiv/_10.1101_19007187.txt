Abstract

5

Aims and objectives: This study aimed to explore the day-to-day experiences of

6

caregivers who are caring for children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI).

7

Background: OI is a rare genetic condition known to cause bone fragility. Family

8

caregivers, such as parents, of children with OI play an important role in helping these

9

children live well at home.

10

Design: The design was qualitative description.

11

Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted which adheres to the

12

COREQ guidelines. Adult caregivers (n=18) of children with OI were recruited at

13

a children’s hospital in Montréal, Canada to participate in individual interviews.

14

The interviews were transcribed verbatim and inductively thematically analysed.

15

Results: The following caregiving themes were identified in these interviews:

16

regular day-to-day caregiving activities, including morning routines, evening

17

routines, and the facilitation of their child’s mobilization; periods that made the

18

caregiving routine more challenging, such as fractures, surgeries, and pain; and

19

the long-term strategies caregivers developed to support day-to-day care, such as

20

managing the environment, accessing medical and school resources, and

21

coordinating care and respite.

22

Conclusions: The results showcase what being a caregiver for a child with OI

23

involves on a day-to-day basis.

Introduction

2

Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare genetic condition affecting 1 in 10 000

3

births that is predominantly caused by an alteration in the genes responsible for collagen

4

production (Marini et al., 2017; Trejo & Rauch, 2016). It is characterized by increased

5

bone fragility, but this chronic condition can also cause teeth and soft tissue

6

abnormalities, discoloured sclera, hearing loss, shortened stature, and skeletal

7

deformities (Marini et al., 2017; Trejo & Rauch, 2016). OI Types I – IV are the original

8

classifications of OI, although other types have been added since (Trejo & Rauch,

9

2016). OI Type I is the most common form of the condition and has the mildest disease

10

severity, with fewer fractures expected over the life course. OI Type II is lethal in the

11

neonatal period. OI Type III is the most severe form of OI that is compatible with a

12

longer lifespan. OI Type IV is of moderate disease severity. OI Types V, VI, and VII

13

are newer classifications that present with different tissue and bone mineralization

14

phenotypes, and have mild to moderate severity (Marini et al., 2017; Trejo & Rauch,

15

2016). At present, there is no cure for OI. Bisphosphonate therapy is used to improve

16

bone mass density (Trejo & Rauch, 2016). Surgery, physical therapy, and occupational

17

therapy are other common treatment modalities (Dogba et al., 2013; Marini et al.,

18

2017).

19

Family caregivers, such as parents, play a critical role in helping children with

20

unique needs to thrive at home in the community (McCann, Bull, & Winzenberg, 2012).

21

It is important to understand the day-to-day experiences of caregivers of children with

22

unique needs - such as the unique care needs of children who have fragile bones - in

23

order to develop policies and services that are adapted to their specialized daily care

24

needs (McCann et al., 2012; Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990). Thus, the aim of

25

this research was to better understand the day-to-day experiences of caring for children

with OI. These results have important implications for clinicians and policymakers who

2

work with families living with OI or other rare, chronic conditions.

3

Background

4

When a child has OI, a parent usually adopts the role of primary caregiver to

5

assist with their child’s everyday needs (Vanz, Felix, da Rocha, & Schwartz, 2015).

6

Challenges unique to OI caregiving include the constant risk of fractures, over-

7

protectionism, social isolation, home adaptations, and suspicions of child abuse

8

(Arabaci et al., 2015; Bernehall & Brodin, 2002; De Carmoy, 2004; Dogba, Rauch, Tre,

9

Glorieux, & Bedos, 2014). OI parents have reported lower scores in the environmental

10

quality of life domain (i.e., the domain which includes factors such as environmental

11

safety and access to social supports) compared to the general population of parents

12

(Szczepaniak-Kubat, Kurnatowska, Jakubowska-Pietkiewicz, & Chlebna-Sokol, 2012;

13

Vanz et al., 2015). The OI caregiver experience may generate positive experiences for

14

families, such as the development of an optimistic mindset and being inspired by their

15

children’s resilience (Dogba et al., 2013). However, for many families, a child’s OI

16

diagnosis appears to be a life-altering event requiring various and ongoing parental

17

adjustments (Arabaci et al., 2015; Dogba et al., 2013; Murphy, Christian, Caplin, &

18

Young, 2007).

19

It is important to understand the day-to-day experiences of caregivers of children

20

with unique needs like OI in order to develop services that are adapted to the specialized

21

daily care needs of these families (McCann et al., 2012; Pearlin et al., 1990). While

22

several studies on the OI family experience have included some analysis of the day-to-

23

day lives of OI caregivers (Bernehall & Brodin, 2002; De Carmoy, 2004; Deatrick,

24

Knafl, & Walsh, 1988; Dogba et al., 2013; Dogba et al., 2014; Hill, Baird, & Walters,

2014; Santos, Pires, Soares, & Barros, 2017), none of these studies focused primarily on

2

the minutiae and routines of daily care.

3

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the day-to-day experiences

4

of caregivers who are caring for children with OI. We interviewed 18 adult caregivers

5

of children with OI about their day-to-day OI caregiving experiences. They described

6

their routine activities of day-to-day caregiving, their experiences during challenging

7

periods of caregiving, and the long-term strategies they developed to support their

8

child’s day-to-day care needs. These findings have important implications for clinical

9

practice, policy, and research.

Methods

Design
The study methodology was qualitative description (Sandelowski, 2000). This

13

study was part of a larger one which sought to explore the views of OI caregivers on

14

using Internet-based technologies to support their caregiving needs (***manuscript

15

available as a preprint. Will add citation after double-blind peer review***).

16

Sample and Recruitment

17

A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit family caregivers of children who

18

were being treated for different types of OI at the study site. Inclusion criteria included

19

all family caregivers of patients being treated for OI at the hospital site, who considered

20

themselves to be the primary caregivers of the child, and who spoke either English or

21

French. A non-authoritative member of the team approached clinicians who had

22

appointments with OI patients to mediate an introduction to the study. If

23

caregivers expressed an interest in learning more about the study, then a member

of the research team described the study and informed the caregiver of the

2

potential consequences of participating. If the caregiver provided their written

3

consent to participate, then an interview was scheduled at the caregiver’s

4

convenience.

Data Collection

6

[***Note to editor and reviewers: To keep this section as anonymous as possible for

7

double-blind review, we have replaced the authors’ initials with “**”. Once the paper is

8

reviewed, we will replace these ** with the specific contributing authors’ initials.]

9

A demographic data survey was filled out by each participant. Individual semi-

10

structured interviews were subsequently conducted by a member of the research team,

11

in either English or French depending on the caregiver’s preference. The interviews

12

were conducted by either author ** or **, at the study site or by telephone or

13

videoconferencing. Key questions relevant to day-to-day care from the larger study’s

14

interview guide are listed in Table 1. The interview guide was reviewed by key

15

informant clinicians prior to the participant interviews. Interviews were audiotaped,

16

field notes were recorded during and after the interviews, and a reflective journal was

17

kept by author **.

18

Analysis

19

The surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The transcribed data and

20

field notes were uploaded into Microsoft Excel, where they were first inductively open-

21

coded by three of the authors (**, **, and **), and then further analyzed primarily by

22

** with inter-coder checks by ** using (Braun & Clarke, 2006)’s six steps for thematic

23

analysis. Interviews conducted in French were first open-coded into English by authors

24

** and ** who are fluent in both English and French. In frequent meetings with the

reflections of **. The carefully anonymized research journal and the codebook may

Ethical Considerations

7

Ethical approval was received from the university’s Institutional Review Board

8

and the study site prior to recruitment. The university’s ethical review process conforms

9

to the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement on the Ethical Conduct for Research

10

Involving Humans. All participants provided written informed consent to participate in

11

the study, with the understanding that they would not be identifiable in any

12

presentations of the research. All participant data were anonymized.

13

Rigour

14

Qualitative rigour was established using (Lincoln & Guba, 1985)’s four

15

criteria of credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability. Credibility

16

was enhanced by the use of reflexive journaling, the audio-taping of interviews,

17

and the research team’s frequent meetings for peer debriefing (Polit & Beck,

18

2012). The dependability of this research was enhanced by careful documentation

19

of our team discussions and decisions in a research journal, and making the

20

anonymized research journal, and codebook available for audit upon request (Polit

21

& Beck, 2012). The confirmability of this research is supported by our carefully

22

documented decision trail in our research journal, our regular team debriefings,

23

and our audit trail (Polit & Beck, 2012). The transferability of this research is

24

supported by the team development of our codebook, inter-coder checks, and our

Results

Demographic Data
Nineteen caregivers were approached in-person, and all verbally agreed to

8

participate. However, one caregiver was lost to follow-up. Eighteen adult caregivers

9

from 14 families were individually interviewed. Thirteen caregivers were women and

10

five were men. Three families resided outside of Canada. Four of the 14 families shared

11

that they had family incomes of less than $50 000 per year, and all 18 caregivers had

12

received at least some post-secondary education. Interviews ranged from 15 minutes

13

to 1.5 hours in length. They resulted in 13.05 hours of audio-recordings and over 8000

14

spreadsheet lines of coded transcript. Their children’s OI types included I, III, IV, and

15

VI; the more severe forms of types III and IV were the most common. Some children

16

with OI required no mobilizing assistance, while others used a wheelchair full-time.

17

Further demographic data are listed in Table 2.

18

Caregiving Themes

19

We inductively derived the following themes relating to the day-to-day

20

experiences of OI caregiving: regular day-to-day caregiving activities, challenging

21

periods, and the long-term strategies caregivers developed to support day-to-day care.

DAY-TO-DAY OI CAREGIVING

10

Regular day-to-day caregiving activities

2

OI caregivers were asked to share what a regular OI caregiving day looked like.

3

Key components of these day-to-day activities included following morning and evening

4

routines to assist with their child’s activities of daily living (ADLs), and facilitating

5

mobilization.

6

Morning and evening routines. Mornings were particularly busy for caregivers,

7

when many ADLs tended to occur all at once, and all tasks needed to be completed

8

before school and paid work began. Mornings consisted of waking everyone up, making

9

lunches, helping children get dressed, and using the bathroom. Some children needed

10

assistance in dressing with their leg braces or corsets. Children needing the most

11

assistance with ADLs were younger children and those with more severe types of OI.

12

Chronic pain management was also a part of the morning routine for at least two

13

families. Most families chose to drive their children to school, although one child used

14

an adapted bus. One mother said her son would walk to school if it was nice outside, but

15

if his backpack was heavy or the sidewalk was icy, she would drive him to school,

16

instead. Another family explained that wheelchair ramps were often too icy or snowy

17

during winter to be useful. Other caregivers shared that they did not use the adapted

18

school bus because it arrived too early to be useful for them in their busy mornings. So,

19

sometimes, services meant to be accessible were not truly accessible for these families.

20

Evenings were described as being more relaxed than mornings. In the evenings,

21

caregivers made dinner, had their children complete chores as they were able to, played

22

games with their children, talked about school, and listened to audiobooks as a family.

23

Caregivers took their children to specialized and frequent physical therapy and

24

occupational therapy appointments. A few parents discussed taking time to cuddle with

25

their younger children. School-aged children were expected to use some of the evening

time for school work; a few parents noted their children’s academic and social

2

successes:

7

Some children engaged in adapted sports, various artistic classes, and other low-impact

8

activities. Older children with fewer accessibility challenges would go outside to play

9

with friends on their own.

10

I’m proud of my kids. [Child with OI] does super well at school and has a nice
personality.
(Mother, Family 5, Type III)

Facilitating mobilization. Mobilizing or transferring their children during these

11

activities was conducted carefully. Some school-aged children would crawl or slide

12

around on their buttocks, reserving walkers and wheelchairs for more fatiguing times.

13

One child with a milder form of OI needed her family’s regular encouragement to move

14

on her own, particularly up stairs where she had more difficulties. Transfers presented

15

with some of the greatest difficulties for families. Many of the children needed at least

16

some assistance in transferring to and from the bed, car, wheelchair, or toilet. One legal

17

guardian shared that “just moving him from point a to point b is most challenging”

18

(Guardian [Mother], Family 8, Type VI). While these caregivers typically lifted their

19

school-aged child into the truck, it was becoming difficult to lift him as he was getting

20

older and heavier. For families that had children with more severe types of OI, all of

21

these activities facilitating mobilization needed to be accomplished without causing

22

further pain or fractures. In contrast, families with Type I OI generally reported not

23

noticing any significant differences in the day-to-day requirements of caring for their

24

child living with OI, compared to caring for a child without OI.

Challenging periods
OI caregivers were constantly aware that the regular daily routines they had

3

established could be disrupted by fractures, surgeries, and pain. These challenging

4

periods increased the care management needed.

5

12

Fractures. The initial stress of bone breaks came from their unexpectedness.

6

The first fractures in their child’s life caused some caregivers to panic, although

7

caregivers said they learned to adapt. One mother shared that a challenging day for her

8

was when she was called from her office due to a fracture at school:

9
10
11
12
13
14
15

The challenging time is when I’m called from the office that there’s a fracture.
Sometimes she fractures in school, sometimes she fractures when she comes
back. And I will have to quickly rush home to go see the severity of the fracture,
whether it’s just a crack, or it’s a real fracture where we have to go to the
hospital. So basically, that’s when it becomes challenging.
(Mother, Family 6, Type III)

16

She explained that she did not like going to the hospital because she said the hospitals in

17

her country did not understand OI; she felt stigmatized in hospitals.

18
19

With more severe forms of OI, a fracture could happen practically
spontaneously. One caregiver explained how easily femur fractures occurred:

20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28

He was jumping on my bed. And, you know, like a normal four-year-old would
do. We were doing laundry, he was jumping on the bed, and with that, we heard
a snap. And he is screaming, leg bevelled out, and we’re like “well, that’s
strange.” And then we went to the hospital, and they’re like, “okay, it’s a femur
fracture.” And that happened about two other times after that. Then they’re like,
“okay, we’re going to test him [for OI]”.
(Guardian [Older Sister], Family 8, Type VI)
Another caregiver shared that whenever her child fractured, she immediately assessed

29

the fracture and administered appropriate medications. Then, her child relaxed for the

30

rest of day. Other parents shared that in the case of severe fractures, they would go to

31

the hospital and wait for treatment and recovery.

Challenges of surgery. Surgeries presented unique difficulties for families.

2

Hospital boredom was often a challenge for parents, especially if they had to fly to

3

Montréal for surgery and wait several days or weeks before returning home. A few

4

caregivers discussed how challenging planning their lives around surgeries could be –

5

especially when, after arranging their work and family schedules around a specific date,

6

the surgery date was sometimes changed by the hospital.

7

Care coordination for treatment created additional challenges for the three

8

international families interviewed. Caregivers shared that accessing OI treatment in

9

their own countries could be difficult, so a few of them received pro-bono treatment

10

supplies through the international OI community. For a mother, whose daughter needed

11

a few surgeries over several months, finding a Montreal sponsor to live with (as may

12

sometimes be required) was a significant care coordination challenge for her. She said

13

she had to somehow find a sponsor to live with for several months, in a city far from her

14

own, while also arranging care with her husband and their other children who would

15

stay behind in her home country. She explained:

16
17

Um, especially when they’re fractured, it’s not as easy to get out. You don’t
want to be transferring them when they’re in pain, getting them into their carseat. And when you’re the only person at home ‘cause your husband’s working,
if you need to go to the grocery store, then you have to take them with you. So
sometimes you’re not necessarily getting yourself ready in the morning because
you’re just trying to get them into a position where they can get out of the house
at some point or for an appointment.
(Mother, Family 13, Type III)

12

After surgery, the family’s routine would change. One mother explained that

13

after a fracture, her child would sleep in the same bedroom as her, receive more pain

14

medication, and stay home for a few days post-surgery. Fractures and surgeries created

15

stress for caregivers during ADLs, as they were worried about any jostling during care

16

work that could harm the child. As a result, caregivers tended to minimize activity and

17

stay at home during these periods.

18

Pain. For some families of children with OI, life could revolve around pain

19

management. One mother explained that when her school-aged son was in pain, he

20

would call for “Mommy!” a lot more frequently (Mother, Family 5, Type III). Another

21

mother shared that her child was often in physical pain, particularly experiencing

22

regular headaches and back pain. As a caregiver, this mother had to evaluate the pain

23

level two to three times per day and administer pain medications as needed. Two

24

parents also shared that their children experienced regular back pain in spite of their

25

fractures being healed. Periods of increased pain, then, created frequent disruptions to

26

OI caregivers’ daily routines.

27

Long-term strategies for supporting day-to-day care

28

A comment by one mother embodied the management of day-to-day care:

Dealing with OI is most likely all the time, how are we going to do things? You
know? How are we going to surpass this limitation?
(Mother, Family 5, Type III)
Caregivers became experts in caring for their children’s unique daily health and care

6

needs. Caregivers developed strategies which would make future day-to-day caregiving

7

work easier. They learned to manage the environment, access medical and school

8

resources, and coordinate care and respite.

9

Managing the environment. Generally, caregivers tried to balance their desire

10

to protect their child from harm, while also minimizing the limits placed on their child

11

day-to-day. Managing care for caregivers often meant “managing the environment more

12

than the kid”:

21

Managing the environment included adapting their housing to be safer (for instance, by

22

installing extra-cushioned carpeting), coordinating with schools to manage the care of

23

their child safely, and searching for low-impact activities that their children could

24

participate in. With these environmental management strategies, future day-to-day care

25

work was made easier, because their homes and schools were more prepared for a child

26

with brittle bones to thrive in, and their children had low-impact activities and skills that

27

they could develop.

responsibility.
(Mother, Family 1, Type IV)

Accessing medical and school supports. Caregivers described spending a lot of

29

their caregiving time researching information and resources about OI, particularly for

30

accessing medical and school supports. Once specialized medical and school supports

31

were established, caregivers felt more at ease in their day-to-day care work.

16

Accessing medical support. For several caregivers, just because they had a

2

diagnosis of OI did not mean they had adequate medical support and information for

3

ongoing care. Caregivers shared that it was only once they found the Montreal OI

4

treatment centre that they felt supported in their child’s medical care. Healthcare

5

providers outside of the treatment centre – such as emergency staff and general

6

pediatricians at other hospitals – did not always know how to treat OI. Some parents

7

shared that when other health professionals tried to treat their children, the clinicians

8

fractured their child’s other bones in the process. One Quebecoise mother believed not

9

enough information was initially shared with her about her rights and available

10

resources. She explained that when her daughter was a pre-schooler, the two of them

11

spent an entire year avoiding all outings because they did not know how to mobilize her

12

growing daughter beyond using a baby stroller. They were socially isolated and home-

13

bound until she was told that her daughter had the right to access a properly fitted

14

wheelchair.

15

Access to the greater OI community was an important resource for finding long-

16

term medical supports. Several caregivers spent a lot of time seeking resources through

17

their OI network. For instance, a few caregivers managed to receive regular OI

18

treatment materials in their own country via the international OI community when they

19

could not access those materials at home. Once caregivers managed to access long-term

20

OI medical supports, either with an established OI social network or – ideally – with a

21

specialized OI treatment centre nearby, caregivers felt more supported in their day-to-

22

day caregiving activities, because they had access to people who were knowledgeable

23

about OI; they were no longer caregiving alone.

24
25

Accessing school supports. For some families, finding daycare centres and
schools that were comfortable with a child with OI was a challenging task. Once they

found an accommodating school, several families described making plans to go into the

2

school every year to share with the new educators how to care for a child with OI.

3

These new school caregivers had to be taught:

Most children were attending public schools. However, they still required access to a

school aide person who could help them in the washroom, carry books, push the

wheelchair, or write for them, as needed.

11

A few caregivers were using more specialized school services. One child moved

12

to Montreal with her mother to attend a school for children with special needs, while the

13

child’s father and siblings remained in their hometown several hours away. Another

14

family was choosing to homeschool their child instead of sending him to a public

15

school, because they wanted to be sure he was mobilizing enough during the day. They

16

feared that a public school would be too scared of him breaking a bone that they would

17

not allow him to mobilize enough.

18

Other routine medical and school resource challenges included the availability

19

of services, language barriers, and Internet access. Even among financially secure

20

families, some families could not find appropriate daycare centres for their child with

21

more severe OI. One mother explained that there was a long waiting list for daycare for

22

children with special needs. Language barriers could also affect resource accessibility.

23

Some families noted that the lack of OI resources available in languages outside of

24

English (such as French) were limited. Access to the greater OI community through the

25

Internet could also determine whether families managed to find a specialized OI

26

treatment centre and other OI resources.

Coordinating care and accessing respite. Caregivers described many care

2

coordination tasks related to their child’s OI. These included the following tasks:

3

arranging and attending numerous medical appointments and treatments, remembering

4

to bring the wheelchair or walker whenever they went out, managing respite care, being

5

flexible with schedules in case of surgery or fractures, keeping track of medical records,

6

seeking out community and health resources, and filling out medical paperwork and

7

reimbursement forms. All of these activities required significant time and coordination

8

skills on the part of caregivers, which frustrated some of the caregivers. However, once

9

these coordination activities were accomplished, they made caregivers’ future day-to-

10

day care work easier. For instance, by carefully organizing and keeping track of their

11

child’s medical records, and by being flexible with their schedules, caregivers were able

12

to quickly adapt if medical emergencies arose.

13

Most caregivers expressed chronic challenges with accessing respite care,

14

explaining that they did not trust others to care for their child with OI. One mother said

15

that learning to trust others is “sort of an issue” (Mother, Family 1, Type IV). Several

16

caregivers shared that they were not comfortable hiring a babysitter for their child with

17

OI, or even leaving their child with friends or family. Still, some families had

18

grandparents and friends who caregivers were teaching how to care for their child in

19

order to provide these caregivers with parenting breaks. Two mothers suggested that

20

more trusted respite care opportunities, such as kids’ events or summer camps organized

21

by OI treatment centres, would be very helpful. If caregivers had easy access to people

22

they trusted to care for their child, day-to-day care was made easier because caregivers

23

had a reliable back-up caregiver. However, most caregivers did not have anyone they

24

fully trusted to provide this care.

Discussion

This study offers a comprehensive overview of the day-to-day experiences of

3

caring for a child with brittle bones, the challenging periods that can disrupt day-to-day

4

routines, and the long-term strategies they developed to make day-to-day OI caregiving

5

easier. Understanding the unique daily experiences of caregivers of children with rare

6

and chronic conditions like OI is important knowledge for helping clinicians and policy

7

makers to build better supports for these caregivers. Such supports could improve

8

caregivers’ daily experiences of caregiving, and therefore improve their child’s care

9

(Luijkx, Putten, & Vlaskamp, 2017; McCann et al., 2012).

10

The limited existing OI literature suggests that OI parents often have more tasks

11

to accomplish in one day than most parents do. Even on typical days without fractures

12

or surgery, a key difference is the child’s independence in completing ADLs. For more

13

severe types of OI, in particular, the multiple physical transfers needed for toileting,

14

clothing, and transport increased the energy and amount of time it took to accomplish

15

these ADLs (Deatrick et al., 1988; Dogba et al., 2014). Facilitating mobilization and

16

transportation for those living with rare and physical conditions is a common but

17

challenging caregiving task (Andrews, 2013). However, in addition to managing the

18

task of mobilization, OI caregivers of children with more severe types of OI also

19

experience the unique and constant fear of fracturing their child while completing

20

transfers and other day-to-day tasks (Brodin, 1993). Our study corroborates these

21

reports of the experiences of OI day-to-day caregiving. In our study, caregivers shared

22

that mornings were the most intense period of the day due to the number of ADLs

23

needing attendance by a strict deadline (i.e., when school and caregivers’ paid work

24

began). Furthermore, and in accordance with the research literature, facilitating their

DAY-TO-DAY OI CAREGIVING

child’s mobilization and transportation was one of the most significant components of

2

caregivers’ day-to-day routines.

3

20

For OI caregivers in our study, periods which presented particular challenges to

4

OI caregivers’ day-to-day routines were periods with fractures, surgeries, and pain.

5

These time periods were also described as some of the most challenging aspects of OI

6

care in other studies of OI families (De Carmoy, 2004; Deatrick et al., 1988; Dogba et

7

al., 2013; Santos et al., 2017). However, while the caregivers in our study

8

acknowledged facing challenges and at times feeling overwhelmed, most appeared to be

9

successfully managing as parents and caregivers. Caregivers explained that once they

10

found the study site (a specialized OI treatment centre), they felt more supported as

11

caregivers. These results correspond with the results of another study which was also

12

conducted at our study site (Dogba et al., 2013). However, these results contrast with

13

other studies on OI caregiving which described caregivers feeling burned out, hopeless,

14

and overwhelmed by the unique challenges of caring for children with brittle bones

15

(Arabaci et al., 2015; Bozkurt et al., 2014; De Carmoy, 2004). These latter studies do

16

not appear to have been conducted in settings with access to specialized OI services.

17

This contrast may speak to the psychosocial benefits that access to specialized OI

18

medical resources can have on OI families.

19

The literature suggests that trying to manage the environment, access medical

20

and school supports, coordinate care, and find trusted respite services are all common

21

care management strategies of chronic caregivers (Pelentsov, Laws, & Esterman, 2015;

22

Samia, O’Sullivan, Fallon, Aboueissa, & Hepburn, 2018). Other researchers have noted

23

that OI caregivers spend significant amounts of time trying to gain reliable access to OI

24

medical and school supports, social supports, and respite care (Arabaci et al., 2015;

2

long-term were described by caregivers in our study, as well.

3

Strengths and Limitations

4

The methodological strengths of this study included providing rich descriptions

5

of the study setting, participant demographics, and methods for transferability purposes.

6

The results help address the paucity of literature available on OI caregiving, as well as

7

on the supportive care needs of parents of children with a rare condition (Pelentsov et

8

al., 2015). While corroborating much of the current OI caregiving literature, our study

9

also adds to our knowledge of OI caregiving by providing more detailed data on what

10

day-to-day OI caregiving looks like. This study appears to be the first to focus on the

11

day-to-day tasks and routines of OI caregiving. Understanding the daily life of family

12

caregivers is important because the differences required in care for caregivers of

13

children with unique health needs can cause significant caregiver distress (Pelentsov et

14

al., 2015). Furthermore, understanding their unique needs can support the development

15

of evidence-based health and social supports for these families (Collins et al., 2016;

16

Luijkx et al., 2017).

17

This study has several limitations. With the time and resources available for the

18

study, only 18 caregivers from 14 families were interviewed. The sample could have

19

benefited from more socioeconomic caregiver diversity. All caregivers had some post-

20

secondary education, and a majority of the families (n=7) reported incomes of more

21

than $80,000 per year. Only one caregiver was under the age of thirty, and all but two

22

parents said they had another adult helping them at home, such as a spouse, adult child,

23

or grandparent. The needs of younger and single-parent OI caregivers should be

24

researched further. Finally, all of these families had access to the study site, which

25

specializes in OI treatment. Researchers should explore the day-to-day experiences and

1

routines of families who have more limited educational and financial resources, and

2

who do not have access to a specialized centre for OI. Since the majority of the

3

caregivers in this study had school-aged children (n=11 of the 17 children), more

4

research should be conducted on the caregiving experiences of those caring for younger

5

children, as well as those caring for teenagers. While these data revealed the day-to-day

6

caregiving routines of regular days and challenging days, we did not fully explore what

7

an excellent or optimal day looks like for caregivers of children with OI. Further

8

qualitative and quantitative research should be conducted to build on this study’s work

9

to better understand the diverse range of OI caregivers’ day-to-day caregiving

10

experiences.

11

Conclusion

12

In conclusion, the rich data collected from these interviews help elucidate the

13

day-to-day activities and challenges faced by OI caregivers. The results complement

14

previous research in the caregiving and OI research fields, while also adding a deeper

15

understanding of the day-to-day experiences of OI caregivers. This knowledge may help

16

clinicians and healthcare systems offer improved services to these families. It also

17

provides further direction for future research initiatives to help promote the health and

18

well-being of OI caregivers.

Relevance to Clinical Practice
This study has implications for nurses and other pediatric clinicians. Finding

21

information about OI, accessing treatment (especially for families who lived far away

22

from the treatment center), finding knowledgeable local healthcare providers, and

23

coordinating available community and school supports, were all challenges faced by the

24

caregivers in our study. Clinicians should share the long-term strategies that these

expert OI caregivers have developed, with newly-diagnosed families with OI. Doing so

2

may help make the initial diagnosis less traumatic, giving families the practical

3

information they need to care for their child at home in the community (Dogba et al.,

4

2013). They should also work to develop clinical home-care tools to provide long-term

5

supports for OI families. For instance, the study site has developed a splint kit that helps

6

caregivers splint their children’s fractures at home; such a kit is particularly valuable

7

when families do not have knowledgeable healthcare professionals nearby to assist them

8

(***Will include citation once double-blind peer review is finished***). Similar

9

resources could further support caregivers in helping their children to thrive with OI.

10

OI medical services should be more accessible. For instance, OI specialists

11

should be easier to find. Nurses and clinical researchers should ensure that they are

12

sharing accessible online resources for families coping with rare conditions like OI. For

13

families coping with rare and relatively unknown conditions, the Internet may be one of

14

their only sources of information (DeHoff, Staten, Rodgers, & Denne, 2016; Knapp,

15

Madden, Wang, Sloyer, & Shenkman, 2011). OI caregivers shared that their day-to-day

16

caregiving experiences were improved once they had access to the study site and

17

specialized OI care. However, a few caregivers also shared that the time taken to travel

18

to appointments, to complete surgeries, and to fill out reimbursement forms was too

19

time-consuming and complicated. Institutions and policymakers should work to ensure

20

that all medical services are accessible, efficient, and easy to navigate, with as little

21

family separation as possible.

22

Policymakers should focus on building supports for trusted respite care and

23

other high-quality services. Policymakers should work to build more comprehensive

24

and qualified respite support services for caregivers of care recipients with complex

25

needs. A few caregivers in this study suggested that child care services provided by

specialized treatment centres, such as special drop off days or summer camps, would be

2

appreciated. Another option might be to develop OI caregiving teaching materials to

3

help caregivers teach their friends and extended family on how to care for their child

4

day-to-day. A few of the caregivers mentioned that even when they had community

5

supports like adapted buses and wheelchair ramps, those services often did not meet

6

their unique caregiving needs, so they did not use them. Policymakers should work to

7

ensure that such services are adapted and truly accessible to families with complex care

8

needs, so that these families can learn to trust and rely on the services developed for

9

them.

What does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community?


These results showcase what being a caregiver for a child with a rare and

12

chronic physical condition - Osteogenesis Imperfecta - involves on a day-to-day

13

basis.

14



Caregivers of children with rare and chronic physical conditions like OI have

15

unique needs, such as physical mobilization support needs, as well as needing

16

better access to medical information, accessible schools, and appropriate care

17

services.

18



Nurses, clinicians, and policymakers who work with families coping with OI

19

and similar conditions should develop interventions and policies that support the

20

unique needs of these families; these interventions and policies should facilitate

21

the long-term strategies that caregivers have already developed to support their

22

day-to-day caregiving activities.
