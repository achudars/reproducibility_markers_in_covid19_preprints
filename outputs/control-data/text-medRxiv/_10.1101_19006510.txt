Abstract

Heart failure is a major medical and economic burden in the healthcare system affecting over 23
million people worldwide. Although recent pedigree studies estimate heart failure heritability
around 26%, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have had limited success in explaining
disease pathogenesis. We conducted the largest meta-analysis of heart failure GWAS to-date and
replicated our findings in a comparable sized cohort to identify one known and two novel
variants associated with heart failure. Leveraging heart failure sub-phenotyping and finemapping, we reveal a putative causal variant found in a cardiac muscle specific regulatory region
that binds to the ACTN2 cardiac sarcolemmal gene and affects left ventricular adverse
remodeling and clinical heart failure in response to different initial cardiac muscle insults. Via
genetic correlation, we show evidence of broadly shared heritability between heart failure and
multiple musculoskeletal traits. Our findings extend our understanding of biological mechanisms
underlying heart failure.

Introduction

Heart failure is a highly prevalent disease [1] that constitutes a major medical and economic
burden in the healthcare system, accounting for approximately 1-2% of the annual healthcare
budget in developed countries [2]. Although almost any disease that directly or indirectly affects
myocardial function can lead to the eventual development of clinical heart failure, it is well
established that certain intrinsic homeostatic mechanisms like the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
axis and the sympathetic nervous system potentiate the effects of a variety of myocardial insults
and cause adverse left ventricular remodeling [3], suggesting that multiple cellular mechanisms
that lead to the disease are shared regardless of the inciting condition.
The increasing appreciation of an underlying strong heritable component of clinical heart failure
further strengthens the argument for shared, yet unidentified, disease mechanisms whose
discovery could reveal novel targets for its treatment and prevention. Indeed, large recent
pedigree studies estimate heart failure heritability to be 26-34% [4]. However, large scale
genome wide associations studies (GWAS) for heart failure have been unsuccessful to-date at
uncovering a significant proportion of this estimated heritability underscoring a major unmet
need in cardiovascular genetics. In fact, the largest published GWAS for heart failure to-date has
only identified one genome-wide significant locus for all-comers with the disease that the
investigators attribute to its overlap with atrial fibrillation [5], thereby revealing no actionable
targets that predispose to heart failure development.

Results and Discussion

GWAS meta-analysis and replication identify novel loci associated with heart failure
We performed a large scale GWAS meta-analysis of five cohorts that study cardiovascular
disease and two population genetics cohorts, all of European ancestry comprising a total of
10,976 heart failure cases and 437,573 controls. We used the 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference
panel to impute variants from SNP array data and analyzed a total of 13,066,955 unique
genotyped or high confidence imputed variants (INFO score > 0.7) with a minor allele frequency
> 1%. We analyzed each individual cohort using a logistic mixed model and meta-analyzed all
studies with fixed effects inverse-variance meta-analysis.
The combined meta-analysis revealed one previously identified and two novel loci associated
with clinical heart failure at a genome-wide significance threshold (p-value < 5e-8) (Figure 1A,
Table 1, Supplemental Table 1). All identified leading variants are common (MAF > 10%) and
are located in non-coding regions of the genome (Supplemental Figure 1). We validated our
genome wide significant loci in an independent cohort of 24,829 self-reported heart failure cases
and 1,614,513 controls of European ancestry from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc.
with all three sentinel variant associations successfully replicating at a nominal p-value level (p <
0.05) (Table 1) and after Bonferroni adjustment.

Genetic correlation reveals shared heritability between heart failure and musculoskeletal
traits
We subsequently performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to estimate heart
failure heritability driven by common variants and the genetic correlation between heart failure
and other complex traits. Liability scale SNP heritability for the disease assuming a population
prevalence of 1.8% [6] was 5.9% (SE 0.7%), much lower than the pedigree-based estimates of
26%, a discrepancy that has been observed for other complex traits [7] and could be explained by
multiple factors including rare variants. The LD score regression intercept was 0.99 indicating no
inflation beyond what can be accounted for by polygenicity. As expected, we saw significant
genetic correlation between heart failure and known heart failure risk factors such as
hypertension, ischemic heart disease, adverse lipid profiles, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. We
also found a strong association between heart failure and pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and GI
traits (Figure 1B, Supplemental Table 2).

Atrial Fibrillation has a causal role in heart failure development

We investigated each genome-wide significant locus in depth. The chromosome 4 locus tagged
by the SNP rs1906615 is found in an intergenic region close to the PITX2 gene. This locus was
previously identified as containing the strongest evidence for association with atrial fibrillation
[8] and has been reported as a significant locus in a recent heart failure GWAS [5]. However,
that association was thought to be mediated via the relative enrichment of the heart failure
population in atrial fibrillation cases [5]. Indeed, via multi-trait conditional and joint analysis
using summary statistics from GWAS of atrial fibrillation, we confirm that the effect of the
PITX2 locus on heart failure is explained by its effect in atrial fibrillation (Table 2, Supplemental
Table 3). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using 110 independent (LD r2<0.001) atrial
fibrillation-associated variants, provides further evidence for a causal effect of atrial fibrillation
on heart failure development (weighted mode MR effect size 0.21 (Odds Ratio 1.23), p<0.0001)
(Supplemental Figure 2).

Variation in an ACTN2 gene enhancer leads to heart failure and ventricular remodeling
The chromosome 1 locus tagged by the SNP rs580698 is found near the ACTN2 gene, a cardiac
sarcolemmal gene at which rare mutations have recently been associated with the development
of cardiomyopathy and consequently heart failure [9]. Multi-trait conditional and joint analysis
with common heart failure risk factors (atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus) does not result in a significant change in the effect of the ACTN2 locus on
heart failure suggesting that the association signal is not primarily mediated via these other
diseases (Table 2, Supplemental Table 3). A phenome-wide association approach (PheWAS)
using echocardiographic and other phenotypic information available for a subset of our cohorts
and participants demonstrates that the ACTN2 locus is significantly associated with both
ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure and has a trend for an effect in left ventricular dilation
and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, thereby suggesting its potential role in
mechanisms predisposing to left ventricular adverse remodeling in response to various initial
insults (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 3). Chromatin state data for the ACTN2 locus from
Roadmap Epigenomics reveal a broad area of muscle specific active enhancer elements in the
skeletal muscle, fetal heart, left and right ventricular tissues (Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure 4).
Integration with eQTL data does not reveal any compelling evidence of colocalization between
the GWAS signal and altered expression of nearby genes in adult blood or post-mortem adult
heart tissues (Supplemental Table 4). Conditioning on the sentinel variant eliminates the signal
for association of the locus with heart failure, suggesting a single causal variant effect in high LD
with the sentinel SNP (Supplemental Figure 5).
Since eQTL analysis in adult tissue did not identify a target gene for the locus, in an effort to
provide a credible hypothesis of how this locus is associated with heart failure, we proceeded
with additional functional characterization. The first step was to fine map putative causal variants
within the locus. First, we generated a credible set of SNPs for the ACTN2 locus based on the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19006510; this version posted September 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

GWAS associations and linkage disequilibrium pattern for each region of interest using
CAVIAR [10]. Then, we intersected the credible set of SNPs with active chromatin states using
the Roadmap Epigenomics ChromHMM 25-state model [11] for cardiac tissues and with
candidate cis-regulatory elements (ccREs) from the ENCODE registry [12]. Of 88 variants in
almost perfect LD within the credible set for ACTN2, only six overlapped regulatory elements in
both Roadmap and ENCODE and were therefore used in downstream analyses (Supplemental
Table 5).
Next, we verified the presence of active chromatin states overlapping our ACTN2 locus SNPs in
engineered human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiomyocytes during different stages
of their differentiation. We showed that one of the six target variants, rs535411 (Supplemental
Table 6) overlaps cardiomyocyte specific ATAC-seq, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac peaks that start
to appear on day 7 of hESC differentiation into a cardiomyocyte and persist until at least day 80
(Figure 2B). High resolution chromatin conformation capture (HiC) analysis of our hESC to
cardiomyocyte model on day 80 of differentiation shows that the ATAC-seq peak is in contact
with the ACTN2 gene promoter (observed/expected interaction frequency = 1.82, p=0.00002)
(Figure 2C, Supplemental Table 7) and its interaction is dynamic and increases during
differentiation (Figure 2D).
Independent experiments from published literature support the presence of cardiac muscle
enhancer in the identified region. Specifically, ChiP-seq data of p300/CREBBP from an
independent cardiomyocyte experiment show a peak at the identified region [13] suggestive of
chromatin-accessible active regulatory elements. Since the ACTN2 gene is known to be induced
during cardiomyocyte maturation [14] and our hESC experiments confirm a dynamic regulatory
region that switches on during cardiomyocyte differentiation, the absence of evidence of ciseQTL effects of our putative causal variant with the ACTN2 gene may reflect a dynamic effect
of the enhancer on gene expression during the maturation process. Moreover, prior studies
support the role of SNPs in this region in cardiac function. Our fine-mapped variant rs535411 is
associated with left ventricular end diastolic dimension (beta= 0.022, p=5.07e-05) in a recent
large scale GWAS of echocardiographic traits [15], which corroborates our hypothesis for a role
of the locus in left ventricular remodeling. Beyond ACTN2, the data from our genetic correlation
analysis (Figure 1B) support a broader role of common variants related to structural
musculoskeletal proteins in heart failure by revealing strongly shared heritability between heart
failure and multiple musculoskeletal disorders (including osteoarthritis, enthesopathies,
intervertebral disk disease) and smooth muscle disorders (esophageal, gastric and duodenal
diseases).

Regulatory variants of the ABO gene predispose to heart failure

Lastly, the chromosome 9 locus tagged by the SNP rs9411378 is found in an intron of the ABO
gene, a gene that determines blood type and has been linked to the development of ischemic
heart disease [16]. A PheWAS of the sentinel variant across 4,155 GWAS from the GWAS Atlas
[17] shows its significant effects in hematologic (red blood cell count, white blood cell count,
monocyte cell count, hemoglobin concentration) and metabolic traits (lipid disorders, diabetes,
activated partial thromboplastin time) (Supplemental Table 8, Figure 3A), whereas a similar
PheWAS approach on 1,448 traits from the UK BioBank reveals its association with venous
thromboembolism (Supplemental Figure 6). Interestingly, conditioning on several traits
associated with our sentinel variant for which GWAS summary statistics are available or on
known heart failure risk factors does not significantly change the signal of association between
the ABO locus and heart failure (Table 2, Supplemental Table 3), suggesting a direct effect of
the locus on heart failure independent of its effect on other human disorders. The locus did not
show any active enhancer or promoter states in cardiac tissues but instead overlapped active
enhancer states in primary hematopoietic stem cells and intestinal cells (Supplemental Figure 7
and 8). The sentinel variant was a strong eQTL for ABO gene expression in eQTLGen and
GTEx whole blood, consistent with our findings of active chromatin state overlap in
hematopoietic lineage cells. In addition, the eQTL signal had strong evidence of colocalization
with the GWAS signal for the same locus (posterior probability 96%) (Figure 3B). Notably, the
sentinel variant in our GWAS is in LD with the most common variant (rs8176719) associated
with O-blood type via a frameshift mutation that is thought to inactivate ABO (LD R2 0.64 in
1000 Genome Europeans). However, the effects of our lead variants on the expression of ABO
remain after stratifying by rs8176719 genotype (Figure 3C) suggesting an additional regulatory
role for our variants which goes beyond tagging the O-blood type variant rs8176719. Similarly,
in our GWAS, a strong signal for association remains within the locus after conditioning on
rs8176719 (Supplemental Figure 9). We should note though that rs8176719 is genotyped or
accurately imputed only on a small subset of our participants (35,836 individuals), which may
limit interpretation of this analysis as definitive evidence of an independent signal. Although
having non-O blood type via a structural coding variation in the ABO gene has been linked to
cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality [18], the mechanisms underlying this
association are not fully understood. Our finding that regulatory variation of the ABO gene’s
expression is linked to the development of heart failure highlights the importance of ABO in
cardiovascular disease and opens the door to further studies to decipher the cellular mechanisms
involved.
In summary, we performed the largest genome-wide association study for heart failure to-date
and replicated our findings in a similarly powered cohort. Our results validate the use of this
approach to discover regulatory variants associated with heart failure predisposition in response
to a variety of cardiac insults, reveal a new mechanism for the disease associated with the
regulation of a sarcolemmal protein during differentiation, underscore the role of the ABO gene
in cardiovascular disease and highlight broadly shared heritability between heart failure and
musculoskeletal disorders.

Methods

Samples
We performed genome wide association studies in five cohorts that study cardiovascular disease
(Framingham Heart Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
Study, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, Women’s Health Initiative) and the eMERGE
initiative. Genotype and phenotype raw data were downloaded from dbGAP (accession numbers
phs000007.v29.p11, phs000287.v6.p1, phs000209.v13.p3, phs000280.v4.p1, phs000200.v11.p3,
phs000888.v1.p1). For each individual study we performed sample level filtering (excluding
samples with assigned and genotype sex discrepancy, extreme deviations from heterozygosity or
missingness). We also excluded individuals that were not of European Ancestry and for every
group of individuals that were related (Identity by descent (IBD) >0.125) we randomly selected
one.
In addition, for each study SNP level filtering was performed to exclude SNPs that had
significant deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in heart failure controls, minor allele
frequency less than 0.01, missing call rate > 0.05 and differential missingness between heart
failure cases and controls. For studies that analyzed their populations with different genotyping
arrays, we also excluded SNPs that had significant deviation in minor allele frequencies (MAF)
between the different arrays. For individuals that were genotyped in more than one genotyping
array, we selected the array that had the most extensive genotyping. We proceeded with imputing
and analyzing each array separately for every study.

Imputation
We imputed each study to the 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference panel using Minimac3 [19] after
pre-phasing with Eagle [20] on the Michigan Imputation Server. Prior to imputation, we lifted
all SNPs to the hg19 human genome build using the UCSC liftOver tool, aligned all SNPs to the
positive strand and filtered out SNPs whose minor allele frequencies deviated by >0.2 compared
to the reference panel’s MAF and SNPs A/T or G/C SNPs with MAF>0.4 as those are prone to
strand alignment errors. After imputation, we excluded all imputed SNPs with imputation r
squared (INFO score) < 0.7, SNPs with MAF <0.01 and SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg p-value
<1e-4. For the eMERGE cohort, imputation was performed independently prior to the start of
this study with procedures detailed elsewhere [21] and we subsequently applied the same postimputation filters.

Genome wide association
For each study, we performed a GWAS for heart failure controlling for age, sex and the first 10
genotype principal components (PCs). PCs were calculated based on a set of independent (LD
r2<0.2) genotyped or high-quality imputed SNPs (INFO score>0.9) in an unrelated population
(IBD <0.08) and the SNP loadings were subsequently used to calculate the eigenvectors for all
individuals included in the analysis. In the eMERGE cohort, since the population was collected
from multiple different hospitals across the United States, we included an additional multilevel
categorical covariate denoting the sample source. All GWAS were performed using a linear
mixed model with the saddlepoint approximation (SAIGE) [22] to account for any residual
relatedness structure in our analysis and for case-control imbalance which is inherent in our
phenotype of interest. For the UK BioBank cohort we used the summary statistics for all cause
Heart Failure (PheCode 428) generated by analyzing the UK BioBank data in the SAIGE paper
[22].

Meta-analysis
We meta analyzed the results of all our GWAS using fixed effects inverse variance meta analysis
via the software METAL [23]. We kept only SNPs that were present in at least 3 studies and
5,000 individuals. The following tools were used for the GWAS: Python, R, PLINK [24],
SNPRelate [25], SAIGE [22], METAL [23].

Replication
We replicated our findings in an independent cohort of 24,829 Heart failure cases and 1,614,513
controls of European ancestry within the 23andMe research cohort. Heart failure in the
replication population was self-reported as an answer to the question “Have you ever been
diagnosed with or treated for Heart failure?”. All three replication variants were imputed with
high quality (imputation r2>0.95) using an imputation panel that combined the 1000 Genomes
Phase 3 panel with the UK10k panel. The variants were analyzed via logistic regression
assuming an additive model with covariates for age, sex, the first five genotype PCs, and
indicator variables to represent the genotyping platform. The p-values were adjusted for an LD
score regression intercept of 1.043.

Phenome-wide association of heart failure subtypes

For each of the five cohorts in our study and the eMERGE cohort, we classified heart failure
individuals as having ischemic heart failure if they also had a history of diagnosed ischemic heart
disease, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass
graft surgery and non-ischemic heart failure otherwise. We also classified individuals as heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction if they had heart failure and at least one echocardiogram
showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%, and heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction otherwise. Individuals that did not have information on myocardial infarction
history or echocardiographic information were not included in the respective analyses. We also
obtained continuous data of LVEF, left ventricular end diastolic diameter and interventricular
septum diameter from each individual’s most recent available echocardiogram. Each of our
sentinel variants from the general heart failure GWA meta analysis were tested for an effect in
each of these variables using SAIGE for the categorical variables and linear regression assuming
an additive genotype effect for the continuous variables with the same covariates as in our
primary GWAS. The results cross-cohort were meta-analyzed using METAL.

Other phenotype associations
To evaluate if our lead GWAS variants had associations with other phenotypes we queried the
NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog and also evaluated the GWAS atlas [17] which contains data from
4,155 GWAS across 2,960 unique traits and the 1,488 Electronic Health Record-Derived
PheWAS codes from the Michigan Genomics Initiative [22].

Heritability and Genetic Correlation
We used LD score regression [26] with the 1000 Genomes European reference LD to evaluate
the liability scale heritability explained by the common variants in our GWAS assuming a
population prevalence of 0.018 [6]. We subsequently analyzed our GWAS together with
summary statistics from GWAS studies from the UK biobank [27] using the genetic correlation
method of the LD score regression pipeline to quantify the shared heritability between our
phenotype and other traits [28]. For the genetic correlation analysis we selected traits to analyze
based on the following procedure:
1. Among all summary statistics analyzed in the SAIGE paper [22], we first excluded the
categories Injuries and poisonings (as it is unlikely to have a major heritable component)
as well as Symptoms and Pregnancy complications (as they are too general to have a
meaningful interpretation of genetic correlation).
2. We excluded general disease bundles that include the work “other” or “NOS” (eg. Other
infectious and parasitic diseases) or are a sign/symptom (eg. Hematuria) or medication
(eg. Chemotherapy).

3. We reclassified all infections into the “Infectious Diseases” category and all congenital
anomalies to their respective organ system.
4. From every organ system or general disease category we selected the three diseases with
the highest number of cases.
5. For every selected disease, we excluded diseases and disorders that are subsets of the
same disease or highly related (eg. Selected disease: Hypertension - excluded disease:
Essential Hypertension).
6. We excluded diseases whose z-score of observed heritability calculated via LD score
regression was <1.

Conditional analysis based on summary statistics
We used the COJO package [29] from the GCTA pipeline to evaluate the residual association
signal within our genome-wide significant loci after conditioning on our sentinel variants or
other variants of interest using as reference the LD of the eMERGE heart failure dataset.

Multi-trait conditional and joint analysis
We used the mtCOJO package [30] from the GCTA pipeline to evaluate the effects of our
variants conditioned to other heart failure risk factors (eg. hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
ischemic heart disease) and conditions associated with our sentinel variants in PheWAS studies
using the 1000 Genomes Europeans reference LD scores.

Mendelian Randomization analysis
We used the MR base package [31] to perform Mendelian Randomization analysis in order to
evaluate the effect of atrial fibrillation on the development of heart failure using summary
statistics from a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis of atrial fibrillation [32]. The polygenic risk
score was constructed using independent variants (LD r2 < 0.001) at a genome-wide significance
threshold (p < 5e-8) using as reference the LD of the 1000 Genomes European samples.

Variant fine-mapping
We followed a step-wise approach based on epigenomic annotations and LD structure for our
variant fine-mapping efforts. We first used the Roadmap epigenomics ChromHMM 25-state
model [11] across all tested cell types and tissues to visualize our significant loci and identify
broad patterns of active promoter or enhancer elements across tissues. We subsequently used

CAVIAR [10] with the 1000 Genomes European reference LD and the assumption of at most
two causal variants per locus to generate a credible set of SNPs for each locus. The CAVIAR
analysis for each locus included all SNPs within 100 kilobases of the locus sentinel SNP. Then,
we intersected the SNPs in each credible set with active enhancer or promoter elements predicted
by Roadmap epigenomics for heart tissues (fetal heart, left ventricle, right ventricle and right
atrium). Finally, we intersected SNPs selected by the previous step with candidate cis-regulatory
elements predicted by ENCODE [12]. Bedtools [33] was used for all intersection tests.

Cardiomyocyte differentiation model
To further probe the effects of the ACTN2 locus on cardiomyocyte function, we used an
engineered human embryonic stem cell differentiation model. The assays are fully described
elsewhere [34], but in brief, we performed ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and HiC experiments
in an engineered H9 hESC MLC2v:H2B-GFP reporter transgenic line that was differentiated into
cardiomyocytes using a well-stablished Wnt-based cardiomyocyte differentiation protocol [35].
Cardiac cell populations were collected and analyzed at different differentiation stages (Day 0,
2,5,7,15 and 80). We queried our fine-mapped variants by intersecting them with ATAC-seq,
H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks in the cardiomyocyte differentiation model and we subsequently
assessed the HiC contacts between the identified peaks and nearby genes. HiC contacts were
generated at 5kb resolution. Expected contacts for each bin are calculated as the genome-wide
average of contacts of the same distance, as Hi-C contacts follow a distance-based delay. The
observed/expected value for each bin shows the enrichment of HiC contacts relative to the
background. We tested the significance of enrichment of observed contacts with respect to the
expected contacts using an upper-tail Poisson test with x equals observed contacts and lambda
equals expected contacts [36].

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
We assessed the effect of our genome wide significant variants in gene expression of nearby
genes using two databases: 1) Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx): We obtained whole genome
sequencing and RNA sequencing data from GTEx version 8. We followed the standard pipeline
proposed by GTEx v7 [37] to normalize gene expression and perform cis-eQTL analyses. In
brief, we filtered out genes with <6 reads or <0.1 counts per million (cpm) in >20% of
participants per tissue, performed normalization of expression values between samples using
TMM [38] and for each gene, we normalized gene expression across samples by an inverse rankbased transform to the standard normal distribution. The effect of a variant in gene expression
was analyzed using linear regression as implemented in MatrixEQTL [39] using age, sex, RNAseq platform, five genotype PCs and 60 Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals (PEER)
factors [40] as covariates. Using the methods above, we tested the effect of the ACTN2 locus

the effect of the ABO locus in Whole blood. 2) To increase the power of detecting a cis-eQTL
association in Whole Blood, we obtained cis-eQTL summary statistics from eQTLGen which
includes eQTL data from 31,684 samples [41]. We queried our ABO locus sentinel variant in the
dataset.

Colocalization analysis
For each identified significant eQTL result for our variants, we evaluated whether the eQTL and
GWAS signals colocalize using a Bayesian colocalization method as implemented in coloc [42]
to estimate the posterior probability of an identical causal variant per locus between eQTL and
GWAS. Colocalization Manhattan plots for Supplemental Figure 1 were generated using
LocusZoom [43].

Figure Legends
Figure 1. A. Manhattan plot of the GWAS meta-analysis. The black dotted line denotes the
genome-wide significance threshold (p-value < 5e-8) while the red dotted line denotes the
suggestive threshold (p-value < 1e-6). B. Genetic correlation values between Heart failure and
other complex traits. The x-axis shows the genetic correlation r-value. Traits are color coded
based on the group in which they belong. Stars denote the Bonferroni adjusted p-value: (*) 0.001
< p-value < 0.01, (**) 0.0001 < p-value < 0.001, (***) p-value < 0.0001
Figure 2. A. Manhattan plot of the ACTN2 locus and the corresponding Roadmap ChromHMM
25-state model annotations in cardiac and muscle cell-types and tissues, H3K4me1, H3K4me3,
H3K27ac peaks in left ventricle and PhyloP and PhastCons evolutionary conservation values.
The blue box highlights the region that contains all 88 credible set variants identified by
CAVIAR and the bottom panel shows a zoomed in view of the credible set region in Roadmap
Epigenomics. B. ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) peaks in the hESC-tocardiomyocyte differentiation model for the fine-mapped SNPs that overlap cardiac specific
active chromatin states. We see that one SNP (rs535411) is overlapping an ATAC-seq peak that
starts to develop on Day 7 of cardiomyocyte differentiation and remains active until Day 80.
Ranges for peak values: ATAC-seq: 0-127, H3K27ac-seq: 0-127, H3K4me1-seq:0-10. C. HiC
data from cardiomyocytes on Day 80 of differentiation for the interaction between the 5Kb
region containing rs535411 and the promoters of nearby (within 1Mb) genes. Significant
interactions after Bonferroni adjustment are colored red, while non-significant interactions
(Bonferroni p>0.05) are colored blue. D. HiC data in different stages of cardiomyocyte
differentiation centered at rs535411. Black lines/dots: expected interaction counts which follow
distance-based decay, Red crosses: observed interaction counts, Blue dashed line: 5Kb region
containing rs535411, Cyan dashed line: 5Kb region containing ACTN2 promoter, p-value
indicates the upper-tailed Poisson probability with the expected counts as lambda.
Figure 3. A. Phenome-wide association of the rs9411378 SNP across over 4,000 GWAS from
the GWAS Atlas. B. Manhattan plot of the ABO locus overlaying a similar manhattan plot for
the ABO gene eQTL in eQTLGen. R2 is the 1000 Genomes phase 3 Europeans LD. We see that
the signal colocalizes which is confirmed by coloc (posterior probability of colocalization 96%).
C. Expression transcripts per million for the ABO gene in GTEx Whole blood stratified by the
genotype of rs8176719 (variant defining blood group O) and rs550057 (variant tagging our
sentinel variant rs9411378 (LD r2=0.92 in 1000 Genomes Europeans)). We see that the T allele
for rs550057 is associated with non-O blood group, leads to decreased expression of ABO in
individuals that are not blood group O and denotes increased risk of Heart Failure in our GWAS
(GWAS beta=0.0961, p-value=6.1e-8).
