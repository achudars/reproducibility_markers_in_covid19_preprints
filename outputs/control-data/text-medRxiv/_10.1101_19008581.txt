interactions with brain networks in relation to cognitive recovery after surgical resection and during
chemo-radiotherapy treatment. Seventeen patients with diffuse non-enhancing glioma (aged 22-56
years) were longitudinally MRI-scanned and cognitively assessed using a tablet-based screening tool
before and after surgery, and during a 12-months recovery period. Using structural MRI and Neurite
Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) derived from diffusion-weighted images, we
respectively estimated tumour overlap and Neurite Density (as an

in-vivo proxy measure of axon and

dendrite concentration) with brain networks and functional maps derived from normative data in

INTRODUCTION
Every year more than 300,000 people worldwide face the diagnosis of a brain tumour. As a result of
their tumours, a large proportion of patients develop cognitive deficits ranging from 29% in patients
with non-irradiated low-grade glioma, to about 90% in patients following chemo-radiotherapy for
metastases (Klein et al., 2002; Meyers et al., 2004). Patients who undergo surgical resection rather
than biopsy have a better overall survival (Jakola et al., 2012), and extending the resection beyond
the abnormality seen on MRI further improves prognosis (Yordanova et al., 2011). However, the
extent of resection is only a worthwhile prognostic factor in the management of the tumour if

structure and function is a significant risk factor for a reduction in quality of life (Santarius et al.,

major interest for patients and clinicians alike.

impairment not only has a dramatic impact on patients’ quality of life, but has also been recognised
as a significant prognostic factor in patient survival (Klein et al., 2003).

Structural MRI provides important information about the brain and tumour and is currently the
state-of-the-art imaging used in clinical practise for brain tumour diagnosis, planning of treatment
and monitoring. However, typical MRI sequences used for clinical evaluation are limited by low
biological specificity that limit their capability to differentiate tumour types and infiltration as well as

compositions.

For

example,

although

gadolinium

contrast enhancement is currently used with MRI as a marker of anaplastic transformation of diffuse
lower-grade gliomas, up to one-third of high-grade gliomas are non-enhancing (Scott et al., 2002).

Recently developed MRI sequences that estimate tissue microstructure integrity have revolutionised

in-vivo investigation of the human brain, but their applications to neuro-oncology have been limited.
The capability of modern MRI protocols has been demonstrated for estimates of tumour infiltration
(Li et al., 2018), grading (Fan et al., 2006), tumour heterogeneity (Just, 2014), tumour progression
(Mohsen et al., 2013) and patient survival (Peng et al., 2013). The incorporation of recent MRI
protocols

these promising findings, no study has yet used NODDI to evaluate the impact of tumours and their
treatment on cognition.

Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGGs) are slow-growing and infiltrative tumours involving glial cells. The
low proliferation rate restricts the “lesion momentum”, which is defined broadly as the growth
kinetics and the speed of a tumour’s evolution,

i.e.

malignant progression. It has been suggested

that the chronic and slowly progressive nature of these tumours allows more time for neuroplastic
reorganisation which results in considerably more favourable survival rates compared to high-grade
gliomas,

Nevertheless, it is well established that although tumours and surgical resection represent focal
lesions within the brain, tumours have an overall impact on cognitive performance (Anderson et al.,
1990) and this may be mediated by a disruption of distant neuronal circuits. These “long-range”
effects produced by focal brain tumour have been also observed at a functional level, with gliomas

reducing long-range functional connectivity (Harris et al., 2014; Maesawa et al., 2015; van Dellen et
al., 2012) and globally disrupting functional integrity (Hart et al., 2019).

A major challenge when predicting the consequences of surgery and radio-chemotherapy is that
higher-order cognitive functions are sub-served by communication across spatially extended neural
circuits that cannot be completely captured using traditional localisation-based models and which,
therefore,

require

whole-brain

approaches.

Large-scale

brain

networks

represented

by

connectomics offer a holistic framework to analysing the brain as a circuit of interacting components
by modelling brain regions as nodes and connections between regions as edges that are critically
related to cognition (Bressler and Menon, 2010). In neuro-oncology, markers derived from brain
network approaches have been demonstrated to be sensitive to the presence of low-grade gliomas
(Xu et al., 2013), plasticity differences between low- and high-grade gliomas (van Dellen et al., 2012),
and surgically induced alterations (Huang et al., 2014). Consequently, the use of brain network data
to explore the potential for cognitive disruption induced by brain tumours and their treatment could
be of major clinical relevance.

In this longitudinal study, we prospectively investigated whether the interaction between tumours

implemented in this toolbox disentangles two key contributing factors of Fractional Anisotropy: the
Gaussian contribution from water molecules located in the extracellular space (defined as the space
around neurites), and the restricted non-Gaussian diffusion that takes place in the intra-cellular
space that is bounded by axonal

and dendritic membranes.

The

apparent intra-cellular volume

fraction that represents the fraction of dendrites and axons was used here as a measurement of
Neurite Density.

Lesion masking and image transformation to standard space
Lesion masks were created using a semi-automated procedure. An experienced neurosurgeon (MH)
initially did a manual delineation of lesion masks for each participant on the preoperative T1 image
slices that included the tumour, and the resection site and damaged tissue on the follow-up T1
images.

For each scan, the first B0 image of the diffusion sensitive sequence was linearly coregistered to the
T1 image using FSL FLIRT. The resulting inverse transformation was used to map the Neurite Density
map into the T1 image space. Each T1 image was non-linearly coregistered to standard space using
FSL FNIRT, but excluding the tumour/lesion mask from the non-linear step of the wrapping to avoid
distorting the spatial distribution of the tumour/lesion. The resulting transformation was additionally

used to map the lesion mask and the Neurite Density map from T1 space to standard template
space. The ICBM 2009a symmetric brain, an unbiased non-linear average of the MNI152, was used
here as a standard template for normalisation of Neurite Density using the contralateral values
hemisphere that contained the tumour.

Networks atlas and meta-analysis maps based on normative data
Functional meta-activation maps were downloaded from Neurosynth (https://neurosynth.org/), a
platform for large-scale, automated synthesis of functional MRI that included data from 507,891
activation maps reported in 14,371 studies. Neurosynth generates statistical inference maps (

i.e., Z

and p-value maps) which display the likelihood of a given term being used in a study if activation is
observed at a particular voxel. We used four terms related to the four cognitive domains assessed by
this study: attention, memory, perception and calculation (Figure 1, top left corner). This resulted in
four meta-analysis uniformity maps that were binarised at Z=0 (

i.e . negative values ignored).

We additionally exploited the map of large-scale networks defined in Yeo et al. (2011). This atlas was
created by clustering functionally coupled regions in 1000 young, healthy adults. Analogous to metaanalytic maps derived from Neurosynth, regions delimited on the 7-Network liberal version of the
Yeo atlas were used as Regions of Interest (ROIs) for calculating tumour overlap and Neurite Density
(Figure 1, top right corner).

Tumour overlapping and Neurite Density estimation
As location of the tumour varied across patients, we calculated, for each ROI and participant, the

3

“Tumour Overlap Index” as the proportion of regional volume (in mm ) that spatially overlapped
with

the tumour (for preoperative assessments) or the lesion

(for postoperative and follow-up

assessments) according to the tumour/lesion masks, after being transformed to standard space.

Median Neurite Densities in each ROI defined on the 7-network Yeo atlas and the 4 Neurosynth
maps were calculated for each participant. Only voxels of the ROI that were not overlapping with the
tumour/lesion mask

were included

in

the

analysis

to

reduce

the

impact of

tumour volume

on

Neurite Density estimation. See Figure 1 for an illustrative flowchart.

Cognitive assessment
Immediately after each MRI scanning session, cognitive performance was evaluated using the OCSbridge

tablet-based

screening

tool

(https://ocs-bridge.com/),

which

is

specifically

designed

for

clinical setting. OCS-Bridge automatically compares a patient score to the distribution (‘norm’) for
people of the same age, sex and educational history sampled from 300 healthy volunteers. We
selected 10

screening tasks

designed

to assess 6

major

cognitive domains:

attention,

memory,

perception, praxis, language and number processing. For each individual task, a z-score value was
computed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of task scores across
participants.

from the z-score of each subsequent task, we defined the longitudinal trajectory of each assessment
(Δ) where negative scores represent worse performance than before surgery (

i.e.

and positive scores are associated with increased performance than before surgery (

i.e.

Statistical analysis
When the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test rejected the null hypothesis of data being sampled
from a normal distribution, Spearman’s rank was used to test associations between imaging and
cognitive data. Pearson’s correlation was used otherwise. Statistical tests that incorporated more
than one assessment from the same patients violates the assumption of independent data. Under
this scenario, we tested the association between variables using a Linear Mixed Effect Model (LMM)
with random intercept and slope that incorporated total tumour volume and total neurite density
(only for NODDI analyses) as covariates:

Impact of tumour volume and tumour overlap on cognitive recovery
The influence of the tumour and its treatment on cognitive recovery was initially evaluated by
comparing the total lesion volume with changes in cognitive performance. We found that although
attention and memory deficits showed a trend of negative correlation, only number processing
deficits were significantly correlated with lesion volume (ρ=-0.66, LMM, Pfdr<0.05,

Figure 3).

Tumours were located on frontal (5 Left Hemisphere -LH- and 4 Right hemisphere -RH-), temporal (6

(

attention deficits were correlated with tumours overlapping with Ventral Attention network (ρ=0.45, Pfdr<0.05) and with attention-related regions (ρ=-0.74, P fdr<0.05; as defined by Neurosynth
meta-analysis;

Similarly, postoperative memory deficits were

significantly associated

with tumours overlapping with the Dorsal Attention Network (ρ=-0.46, Pfdr<0.05) and DMN (ρ=-0.60,
Pfdr<0.05). When follow-up assessments were included in the analyses (3 months and 12 months),
we found a significant association between Attention deficits and tumours overlapping with DMN
(ρ=-0.57, Pfdr<0.05) and attention-related regions (ρ=-0.53, Pfdr<0.05). Memory deficits were also
correlated with tumours overlapping with DMN (ρ=-0.59, Pfdr<0.05;

Peri-tumoural effect of tumours on Neurite Density
The impact of tumours and their treatment on brain structure were also explored using a Neurite

as a function of distance to the tumour boundary. Peri-tumoural regions located between 0 and 20

regions (

DISCUSSION
In this study, we combined MPRAGE and NODDI diffusion MRI with normative brain network data
from healthy participants and functional metanalysis maps derived from Neurosynth to determine
whether cognitive trajectories are affected by the tumour in cognitive-related circuits. We found
that attention and memory deficits were associated with lesion overlap with Attentional Network,
DMN

and

attentional-related

regions.

Conversely,

Neurite

Density

derived

from

NODDI

was

compromised not only at the location of the tumour, but also in the area surrounding the tumour,

attention

and

memory recovery were associated with higher Neurite Density within Frontoparietal networks (preoperatively)

and

also

within

the

and

networks (postoperatively

and

Overall, these results suggest that the effect of a tumour on the brain and its cognitive consequences
depends on interactions with brain networks and cognitive-related regions at both local and global
levels.

longitudinal changes in all domains under other neurological conditions (Demeyere et al., 2015;
Kong et al., 2016), our OCS-Bridge assessments did not find longitudinal language and praxis changes

in this sample, presumably because deficits were too subtle and effect sizes too small at our sample
size, suggesting that OCS-Bridge may be complemented by other evaluations that specifically screen
these domains. For the remaining domains – attention, memory, perception and number processing
– we observed a variety of cognitive recovery trajectories after surgery and during subsequent
treatment that included: no cognitive change, postsurgical deterioration and then improvement, and
postsurgical

and

deterioration.

Although

the

mechanisms

behind

cognitive

improvement after major surgery are not understood, previous studies have reported similar rates
of

cognitive

recovery

following

tumour

surgery

(Habets

et

al.,

2014;

Talacchi

et

al.,

2011).

Nevertheless, given that pre- and postoperative assessments were performed in a relatively short
period of time, we cannot discard the possibility of practice and learning effects on the tasks.

Tumour location is one of the most relevant features to be considered when estimating the cognitive
risks of surgical resection. In our cohort, gliomas were mainly located in frontal, temporal and insular
cortices on the left hemisphere. The higher prevalence of left-hemisphere tumours is because this
study

surgery.

On

the

other

hand,

the

higher

prevalence of frontal, temporal and insular tumours is consistent with previous studies showing that
low- and high-grade gliomas are relatively scarce in primary cortices and occipital lobes (De Witt
Hamer

et

al.,

2013;

Larjavaara

et

al.,

2007).

Although

several

developmental,

cytomyeloarchitectonic, neurochemical, metabolic, and functional reasons have been proposed, the
mechanisms behind this preferential location of gliomas across the brain is still an ongoing debate
(Duffau and Capelle, 2004; Ghumman

et al., 2016). The

presence

of gliomas

in secondary and

association cortices that have been traditionally associated with cognitive processing (GoldmanRakic, 1988) may be an important factor to understand cognitive deficits induced by the tumour and
its treatment. Notwithstanding, we found no cognitive recovery differences between patients with

impairment before treatment (Tucha et al., 2000) and are aggravated by the clinical requirement of
having more extensive surgical resections (Talacchi et al., 2011) and larger irradiation volumes and
doses during radiotherapy (Klein et al., 2002).

Beyond the impact that tumour volume itself has on cognitive

recovery, we hypothesised that

cognitive deficits are associated with treatment-induced disruption of brain networks that have been
previously identified as fundamental for cognition. In support of this hypothesis, we found significant
associations between treatment-induced attention and memory deficits and lesion overlap with the

analysis. Functional networks were defined using normative data from healthy individuals and we

consistently

reported in

the

literature. DMN functional connectivity is reduced in glioma patients when compared with controls

tumour grade, but not with total lesion volume. Other networks such as language (Briganti et al.,
2012) and motor (Otten et al., 2012) also had significantly lower functional connectivity in glioma
patients. It has been hypothesised that network-specific

functional disruption

may mediate

the

treatment-induced decline in some cognitive domains such as attention (Charras et al., 2015) and
executive function (D’Agata et al., 2013). However, more research is needed to better understand
the role of these networks on the cognitive deterioration in brain tumour patients.

Not surprisingly, we found a consistent Neurite Density decrease within the tumour. Given that
Neurite Density derived from NODDI and Fractional Anisotropy are strongly correlated (Zhang et al.,

and

studies revealing a strong positive correlation between FA and tumour cell density in the mouse
(Kinoshita et al., 2008) and rat brains (Jespersen et al., 2010). Consequently, high-grade tumours
show increased FA (White et al., 2011) that has been associated with low overall survival (Qu et al.,
2016).

However,

the

established factors such as age and patient functional status is still unclear (Huber et al., 2016). For
its part, NODDI has shown higher sensitivity for glioma grade differentiation than other diffusion
sequences (Vellmer et al., 2018). Zhao et al. (2018) recently reported that NODDI in combination

and

respectively. Despite these promising findings, the potential of NODDI as a predictor of patient
cognitive recovery has not yet been explored in the literature.

We additionally found evidence in support of the hypothesis that tumours have both local and
distant effects. Neurite Density was decreased not only within the tumour mask, but also beyond its
boundary, being particularly disrupted in larger tumours. Thus, despite peri-tumoral regions being
identified on T1 images as unaffected by the experienced neurosurgeon that delineated the mask,
and by the semi-automatic segmentation procedure, these regions had decreased neurite density
compared with the contralateral hemisphere. Long-distance tumour effects have been observed
with regard to functional connectivity (Ghinda et al., 2018) and functional complexity (Hart et al.,
2019). Disrupted white matter integrity has been reported in DTI studies that show decreased FA in
peritumoural regions (Holly et al., 2017) and white matter tracts (Miller et al., 2012). Interestingly,
Masjoodi et al. (2019) reported that FA, but not NODDI have been found to distinguish oedematous
white matter fibres.

Extratumoural Neurite Density disruption had a differential impact on cognition depending on the
affected

brain

network.

We

found

that

preoperative

Neurite

Density

within

the

Frontoparietal

network was associated with memory and attention recovery after surgery. Frontoparietal Network
has a central role in cognitive control and network adaptability that is made possible by flexible,
highly-connected regions (

i.e. hubs) that

shift more rapidly than other networks across a variety of

task states (Cole et al., 2013). LaBar et al. (1999) hypothesized that memory and attention are
subserved

by

neuronal

networks

that

intersect

at

several

Frontoparietal

sites.

More

recently,

attention and working memory are increasingly seen as overlapping constructs modulated by topdown mechanisms (Gazzaley and Nobre, 2012). Functional MRI studies have consistently reported
activation in frontoparietal regions during memory and attentional tasks (Borst and Anderson, 2013;
Huang et al., 2013). Hubs and the topological efficiency of the Frontoparietal Network have been
associated with alerting and executive control subfunctions of attention (Markett et al., 2014) and
memory (Sala-Llonch et al., 2014). Overall this suggests that high Neurite Density (pre and postoperatively)

a

in

recovery that is mediated by the prominent role of brain regions implicated in these cognitive
domains. Moreover, when follow-up NODDI images were included in the analyses, we

allocation of attentional and memory resources to the task-relevant region due to task demands

functions.

However, this anti-correlation exhibits substantial variability across time and is coordinated with
broader dynamics involving the Frontoparietal Network (Dixon et al., 2017). From the connectomic
perspective, cognitive performance of brain tumour patients has been associated with hub-related
structural connectivity within the DMN and Frontoparietal Network in hemispheres contralateral to
the tumour (Douw et al., 2019). By using connectomic metrics derived from both DTI and fMRI, Liu
et

al.

(2016)

patients.

However, further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms by which low- and highgrade glioma, and treatment disruption mediate cognitive decline.

Limitations
In the present work, brain networks were defined using normative data from healthy individuals
(Yeo et al., 2011) and meta-analytic maps (Neurosynth). However, the mechanical and physiological
disturbances induced by the tumour and the surgical intervention presumably have a major impact
on the spatial pattern of brain networks. By using brain network templates and meta-analytic maps
in standard space we neglected the potential spatial shift of brain functioning in our participants.
Thus, our results should be interpreted as the potential of the tumour to disrupt the corresponding
healthy network, not the actual tumour/lesion overlap with each participant’s network.

Some patients had difficulties completing cognitive assessments due to the impact of surgery on
their general condition. Consequently, missing follow-up data has the risk of attrition bias. While our
application of the OCS-Bridge cognitive assessment app offered numerous advantages, most notably
the possibility of reliable longitudinal assessments during follow-up, it is possible that this was with a
compromise

in

sensitivity

to

detecting

specific

deficits,

such

as

language

or

praxis.

Further

exploration of cognitive testing methods and paradigms is a priority for the field.

Treatment of the patients was decided solely on clinical criteria. As a consequence, 6 patients had
only a surgical intervention while 11 additionally had different chemo-radiotherapy regimes. Chemoradiotherapy

has

a

on

structural

integrity

that

has

been

associated with poor cognitive performance (Chapman et al., 2013; Connor et al., 2017; Deprez et
al., 2012). Unfortunately, the contribution of the different treatment strategies to the observed
brain disruption and cognitive decline cannot be untangled here due to the limited sample size.
Finally, while all our patients had the pre-operative imaging appearances of a diffuse low-grade
glioma, subsequent pathological examination revealed a range of histological diagnoses, in keeping
with previous studies demonstrating the diagnostic limitations of standard MRI sequences. This
variation in diagnoses may offer a further variable that impacts on cognitive outcomes.

Conclusion
Our findings highlight memory and attention deficits that are associated with tumours overlapping
the DMN,

the Attentional

Network and Attention-related regions.

Neurite

Density

is decreased

beyond tumour boundary, whereas high values within frontoparietal, DMN and Attention networks
are associated with better memory and attention recovery. Taken together, these results reveal the
potential of combining brain network data and advanced MRI sequences to better understand and
predict the impact of brain tumours and surgery on patients’ cognitive outcomes.
