Abstract
Treatment response in schizophrenia is heterogeneous and has been posited to divide into three
distinct subcategories: treatment-responsive (first-line responders; FLR), treatment-resistant (TRS,
responding to clozapine), and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia (UTRS, requiring augmented
antipsychotic therapy). Previous work suggests that white matter abnormalities drive antipsychotic
resistance but little work has been carried out to identify differences between those with TRS and
those with UTRS. The current study aimed to establish whether differences in white matter structure
are present across both treatment-resistant subtypes of schizophrenia or if UTRS is distinct from
TRS. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired for 18 individuals with TRS, 14 with UTRS, 18 FLR and
20 healthy controls. Measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity
(RD) and parallel diffusivity (PD) were obtained using tract-based spatial statistics. Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc between-groups t-tests interrogating differences were conducted
for each white matter measure. Those with TRS had lower FA than healthy controls across
widespread regions of the brain, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum,
thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata and fronto-occipital fasciculus
(p<.05 FWE-corrected). Lower FA was also observed in those with TRS compared with UTRS in the
superior longitudinal fasciculus (p<.05 FWE-corrected). However, post-hoc tests failed to survive
corrections for multiple comparisons across the 12 post-hoc contrasts. No differences in MD, PD or
RD were observed between groups. These data suggest that TRS is distinct from UTRS and that lower
FA could act as a biomarker of treatment resistance in people with schizophrenia.

Introduction
Pharmacological intervention is the most effective treatment for schizophrenia (Matheson et al.,
2014). However, the rate of response to initial treatment with typical or atypical non-clozapine
antipsychotics reaches only 60% to 80%, with response rates to a second non-clozapine
antipsychotic as low as 16% (Agid et al., 2011; Elkis and Buckley, 2016). Resistance to first-line
antipsychotic therapy accounts for some of the highest rates of hospitalisation and impaired
functioning in mental health (Iasevoli et al., 2016; Lieberman and Murray, 2012) and is estimated to
require USD 34 billion per annum in direct healthcare costs in the US alone (Kennedy et al., 2014).
Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis (Siskind et al., 2017) revealed that clozapine, the most effective
treatment for first-line therapy-resistant schizophrenia, is effective in only 40% of treatmentrefractory individuals, suggesting that 12% to 20% of people with schizophrenia are ultra-treatmentresistant. Reflecting on these observations, researchers have posited that these three response
levels represent three distinct subtypes of schizophrenia: treatment-responsive (first-line
responders; FLR), treatment-resistant (clozapine responders; TRS) and ultra-treatment-resistant
schizophrenia (clozapine-resistant; UTRS) (Farooq et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015).
A growing body of research investigating potential differences in structural brain organisation
between response subtypes of schizophrenia lends support to the concept of treatment-based
categorical distinctions in this disorder and suggests that differences in white matter structure are
present even at first episode of psychosis (Chen et al., 2018; Reis Marques et al., 2014). Reis
Marques et al. (2014) reported that, at baseline, individuals with first-episode psychosis who failed
to respond to a 12-week course of first-line antipsychotic therapy had lower fractional anisotropy
(FA) than either healthy comparison subjects or responders in the left uncinate fasciculus, cingulum
and superior longitudinal fasciculus and commissural tracts such as the corpus callosum (responders
were indistinguishable from healthy comparison subjects). In support of these findings, Chen et al.
(2018) identified white matter impairments in the right temporal and occipital lobes in resistant
compared with responsive individuals with first-episode psychosis following one year of
antipsychotic treatment. Differences in FA between responders and non-responders to first-line
therapy also appear to persist throughout the course of disease. Widespread reductions in FA have
been reported in patients who met criteria for TRS prior to commencing clozapine when compared
to healthy subjects (Holleran et al., 2013). Researchers also identified lower FA in the body of the
corpus callosum in those with clozapine-eligible schizophrenia compared with FLR (McNabb, Carolyn
Beth et al., 2018), as well as reduced mean generalised FA within 12 white matter tracts in people
with non-remitting compared with remitting schizophrenia (Huang et al., 2018). Two earlier cross-

sectional studies of patients with chronic schizophrenia also reported that a poor response to
antipsychotic treatment was associated with lower FA in the whole brain and in specific tracts such
as the uncinate and superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF) (Luck et al., 2011; Mitelman et al., 2006).
Although these studies provide mounting evidence for a role of white matter aberrations in
treatment-resistant subtypes of schizophrenia, they have focused primarily on comparisons with
healthy controls and differences between FLR and those with TRS (or poor treatment outcome),
either omitting those with UTRS or absorbing them into the TRS subtype. If a diagnosis of
schizophrenia really does divide into three distinct response subtypes, studies should be designed to
distinguish between FLR, individuals with TRS and those with UTRS. Therefore, the current study
sought to investigate white matter markers of treatment response in people with schizophrenia
using the classification scheme proposed by Farooq et al. (2013) and Lee et al. (2015); specifically,
categorising the disorder into FLR, TRS and UTRS subtypes.

Experimental methods
Participants
Details of participant recruitment have been described previously (Anderson et al., 2015; Goldstein
et al., 2015; McNabb, C. B. et al., 2018). Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) were recruited from mental
health services (a community mental health centre or forensic psychiatric inpatient unit) in
Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were enrolled into one of three study arms (FLR, TRS or UTRS).
Those who were responding well to first-line atypical antipsychotic monotherapy were assigned to
the FLR group; response was defined as an improvement of positive symptoms according to
standard practice and current treatment guidelines for schizophrenia (Lehman et al., 2004; McGorry,
2005). Those who had failed at least two previous six-to-eight-week trials of atypical antipsychotics
and were receiving clozapine at the time of screening were assigned to the TRS group and
participants who had failed at least two previous six-to-eight-week trials of atypical antipsychotics
and had also failed an adequate trial of clozapine monotherapy (at least 8 weeks post titration
(Mouaffak et al., 2006)) were assigned to the UTRS group. Patients in all treatment groups were
required to be at most mildly ill, determined using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) (which
corresponds to a score of 3 out of 7 using this scale; 7 being the most extremely ill) to control for
state effects (as otherwise differences in the TRS/UTRS groups could be ascribed to the presence of
more severe symptoms). A healthy comparison group with no history of mental or neurological

illness was recruited by advertising in the community. Age, sex and ethnicity were matched on a
group basis. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 45 years. Exclusion criteria were as
follows: history of traumatic brain injury (loss of consciousness for more than three minutes),
neurological illness, significant physiological comorbidity or contraindication to magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The study was approved by the Northern X Regional Ethics Committee (reference:
NTX/09/05/042) and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration as revised 1989. All
participants gave informed written consent - ability to give informed consent was judged by the
treating psychiatrist.
Duration of psychosis and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores (Kay et al., 1987)
were assessed at study entry. Antipsychotic dose at the time of assessment was converted to
chlorpromazine equivalents (CPZE) using formulae with power transformation (Andreasen et al.,
2010). In the absence of a power formula for amisulpride, CPZE were calculated using expert
consensus regarding antipsychotic dosing (Gardner et al., 2010). Participants also provided a urine
sample, which was screened for the presence of amphetamine, methamphetamine,
benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates and tetrahydrocannabinol (Medix Pro-Split Integrated Cup, Multi
Drug Screening Test; Sobercheck Ltd). Standardised premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were
determined using a computerised version of the “spot the real word” task within the IntegNeuro test
battery (Brain Resource Company, Sydney, Australia) (Baddeley et al., 1993; Gordon, 2003; Gordon
et al., 2005). The sample size was based on previous studies examining the relationship between
treatment outcomes and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures in schizophrenia (Garver et al.,
2008; Luck et al., 2011; Mitelman et al., 2009).
Image acquisition and pre-processing
Scanning was performed using a 3T Siemens Magnetom Skyra (Siemens, Germany). A 32-channel
head coil was used for the majority of scans; where the participant could not fit comfortably into this
coil, a 20-channel head coil was used (n=5). T1-weighted images were acquired using a
magnetization-prepared 180-degrees radio-frequency pulses and rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE)
sequence (Brant-Zawadzki et al., 1992). Acquisition parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR)
1900 ms; echo time (TE) 2.39 ms; inversion time (TI) 900 ms; flip angle 9°; repetition 1; acceleration
factor 2; field of view (FOV) 230 mm; matrix 256 x 256; voxel size 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.8 mm. Diffusionweighted images were acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following
parameters: TR 8900 ms, TE 95 ms, FOV 240 mm, matrix 122 x 122, 2.0 mm slice thickness, isotropic
voxel size 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 mm. An acceleration factor (GRAPPA) of 2 was used. Sixty-seven slices were
acquired in the anterior to posterior direction with diffusion-weighting factor b=1000s/mm2 in 64

unique gradient-encoding directions. Eight scans without diffusion weighting (b=0) scans were also
acquired. All scans were examined for artefacts including subject motion, excess signal-to-noise and
incomplete acquisitions. No participants were excluded on this basis.
Measures of white matter integrity, including FA, mean diffusivity (MD), parallel (axial) diffusivity
(PD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al.,
2006), part of the FMRIB Software Library - FSL (Smith et al., 2004). FA images were created by
fitting a tensor model to the raw diffusion data using FMRIBs Diffusion Toolbox (FDT), and then
brain-extracted using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) (Smith, 2002). All subjects' FA data were then
aligned to the FMRIB58_FA target image using the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT (Andersson et
al., 2007) which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field (Rueckert et al., 1999)
and transformed into Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI)-152 standard space. Next, a mean FA
skeleton representing the centres of all white matter tracts common to the group was created and
thinned at a threshold of 0.3 to exclude low anisotropic regions. Each subject's aligned FA data were
then projected onto this skeleton. Anatomical localisation of significant white matter clusters was
determined using the Juelich histological white matter labels and tractography atlases. The same
approach was used for preprocessing of MD, PD and RD data.
Statistical analysis
Whole-brain statistical analyses were performed using FSL’s Randomise tool. Threshold-free cluster
enhancement was used for statistical comparisons, utilising a nonparametric permutation test in
which group membership was permuted 5,000 times to generate a null distribution for each
contrast. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to investigate whether any difference
between groups existed in the data. Post hoc unpaired t-tests were then used to explore potential
differences between the groups. Age and sex were demeaned prior to analysis and included as
covariates of no interest in both ANOVA and post hoc analyses (Bose et al., 2009). A single regression
correlation (Pearson) was also performed to investigate the association between white matter
measures and daily antipsychotic dose in CPZE. All voxel-wise p-values were corrected for multiple
comparisons using a Family-Wise Error (FWE) correction threshold of p = .05; post hoc tests were
corrected for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Both corrected and
uncorrected post hoc t-test results are presented.
Analyses of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were conducted using the Psych and
DescTools packages for R (R Core Development Team, 2012; Revelle, 2017; Signorell et al., 2019).
ANOVA was used to compare continuous variables with Bonferroni correction for multiple

comparisons of post hoc tests. Fisher’s Exact test was used for comparisons of non-parametric data.
FA images were created in FSLeyes and plots were created using the ggplot2 package in R (Wickham,
2016).

Results
Participants
A total of 70 participants (20 healthy controls, 18 FLR, 18 individuals with TRS and 14 with UTRS)
were included in the final analysis. Demographic and clinical data are summarized in Table 1. There
were no significant differences in gender, age, IQ or positive tests for THC between the groups. No
differences in duration of illness, duration of untreated psychosis, PANSS total scores, or any of the
subscales were observed between the groups with schizophrenia. Those with UTRS were receiving a
higher dose of antipsychotics (measured in CPZE) at the time of scanning compared with both FLR
and those with TRS; clusters demonstrating differences in FA between treatment groups were
therefore correlated against CPZE to determine whether antipsychotic dose affected the results.
TBSS results
An ANOVA between all study groups revealed a statistically significant effect for FA but not for MD,
PD or RD. Pairwise comparisons between groups (FWE-corrected) revealed lower FA in those with
TRS compared to healthy controls (figure 1) as well as those with UTRS (figure 2). Neither test
survived corrections for multiple post hoc comparisons between groups using the FDR; however, the
consistency of our findings with the literature to date suggests that this is most likely a result of
small sample size as opposed to false positive results.
Clusters with lower FA in those with TRS are shown in figure 3 and described further in table 2.
Those with TRS had lower FA than controls in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (bilateral), corpus
callosum, thalamic radiation (bilateral), corticospinal tract (bilateral), internal capsule (left), corona
radiata (bilateral) and fronto-occipital fasciculus (bilateral), among other regions. In contrast,
differences between those with TRS and UTRS were confined to the right superior longitudinal
fasciculus (including the temporal component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus).
To further interrogate the differences between groups, mean FA for each cluster was determined for
every participant (figure 4). FA was lowest in those with TRS for all clusters and, for the most part,
was similar for FLR and those with UTRS, both of which had slightly lower FA than healthy controls.
The exception was for the single cluster exhibiting lower FA in those with TRS compared with UTRS,

in which the effect appears to be driven by a combination of low FA in those with TRS and high FA in
those with UTRS.
Correlation with clinical characteristics
As CPZE demonstrated differences between treatment groups, we ran additional regression analyses
investigating the relationships between CPZE and white matter measures. There was no area
identified where FA, MD, PD or RD correlated with antipsychotic daily dose in CPZEs. Likewise, no
statistically significant relationship between cluster FA and antipsychotic dose measured in CPZE was
identified when measured independently for each cluster (figure 5). Similar analyses were conducted
for PANSS total score and age at onset of psychosis in those with schizophrenia and no significant
relationships to cluster FA values were identified (see supplementary figures S1 and S2,
respectively).
Correlation with socio-demographic characteristics
As previous work found significant associations between IQ and FA (Luders et al., 2007; Luders et al.,
2011; Navas‐Sánchez et al., 2014), for each cluster, we ran correlations between mean FA and
standardised (premorbid) IQ. IQ correlated with mean FA in two clusters (figure 6), although only
one survived corrections for multiple comparisons across clusters (Bonferroni-corrected p threshold
.007). The significant correlation was for a cluster spanning only 5 voxels (located in the left external
capsule / inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus / uncinate fasciculus) whereby those with TRS had lower
FA than healthy controls. The remaining clusters showed no relationship between FA and IQ.

Discussion
Results from studies investigating white matter integrity in people with schizophrenia have
increasingly contributed toward a consensus that people who fail to respond to first-line
antipsychotic therapy exhibit greater disruptions in FA than treatment responders (Chen et al., 2018;
Huang et al., 2018; McNabb, Carolyn Beth et al., 2018; Reis Marques et al., 2014). However,
schizophrenia encompasses two distinct subtypes of treatment resistance ̶ clozapine responsive
treatment resistance (TRS) and clozapine resistant treatment resistance (UTRS). This was the first
study to explicitly define and compare these two subtypes in addition to FLR and healthy controls to
investigate possible white matter markers of treatment resistance in people with schizophrenia. Our
results suggest that TRS and UTRS are distinct from one another in their white matter profiles, TRS
exhibiting lower FA than both healthy controls and UTRS. Therefore, resistance to the clinical

benefits of first-line antipsychotic drugs and subsequent sensitivity to clozapine may be attributable
to global disruptions in FA. By comparison, those with UTRS had FA comparable to FLR and healthy
controls, suggesting that white matter disruptions play a less pivotal role in treatment resistance for
these individuals.
Prominent regions of white matter disruptions in our TRS cohort included the superior longitudinal
fasciculus (including the temporal region of this tract), body and splenium of the corpus callosum
and forceps major, corticospinal tract, superior and posterior corona radiata, posterior limb of the
internal capsule, anterior and posterior thalamic radiation, the external capsule, uncinate fasciculus,
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and cerebral peduncle. Our findings of widespread white matter
aberrations in those with TRS are in agreement with previous studies investigating white matter
integrity in responders and non-responders to first-line therapy. Luck et al. (2011) identified reduced
FA in people with chronic schizophrenia experiencing poor response compared with healthy controls
within the superior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus but not the cingulum, with FA
reductions more pronounced in the poor outcome compared with good outcome group (Luck et al.,
2011). Likewise, Reis Marques et al. (2014) found that those who went on to develop a poor
response to antipsychotic treatment exhibited decreased FA across multiple white matter regions,
including the left uncinate, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum,
compared to healthy controls. The corpus callosum is the fundamental white matter structure
conferring interhemispheric connectivity. Lower FA in the forceps major, splenium and body of the
corpus callosum in our TRS group is in agreement with previous studies investigating treatment
resistance, as well as schizophrenia more generally. Decreased FA in the corpus callosum is
consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia (Bora et al., 2011; Foong et al., 2000; Kong et
al., 2011; Kubicki et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2011) and more specifically chronic schizophrenia (Douaud
et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2010; Kubicki et al., 2008; Mitelman et al., 2009; Miyata et al., 2010;
Rotarska-Jagiela et al., 2008). Mitelman et al. observed lower average FA in the corpus callosum of
individuals with schizophrenia with poor-outcome compared with good outcome (Mitelman et al.,
2009). Lower FA in the body of the corpus callosum has also been observed in people with
schizophrenia who are eligible for clozapine compared with those responding well to first-line
antipsychotic therapy (McNabb, Carolyn Beth et al., 2018). Though we did not detect differences
between patient groups in the current study, FA was lowest in the group with TRS throughout the
corpus callosum body, splenium and forceps major, suggesting that callosal aberrations are most
severe in this population.

Our finding of lower FA in the fronto-occipital fasciculus may be driven by disruptions in myelination
in those with TRS. A recent study investigating magnetic resonance markers of myelination found
lower myelin water fraction in people with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls in this
region, although no difference between resistant and responsive patients were observed (Vanes et
al., 2018). Myelin water fraction within the corpus callosum was also associated with cognitive
control in those with schizophrenia. In their study, Vanes et al. (2018) explicitly excluded individuals
receiving clozapine to avoid the introduction of subgroups including ultra-treatment-resistant
schizophrenia. However, we have demonstrated that this subgroup exhibits white matter patterns
quite distinct from TRS, suggesting that distinguishing TRS from UTRS provides useful information
about the treatment response patterns of individuals with schizophrenia.
Although we did not demonstrate significant differences in white matter between all schizophrenia
cohorts and healthy controls in the current analysis, a previous analysis of the same participants
identified lower white matter volume in all schizophrenia groups compared with controls (Anderson
et al., 2015). Therefore, the lower (but not statistically significant) FA observed in FLR (and to a lesser
extent those with UTRS) compared with healthy controls could indicate a less severe but still
clinically relevant reduction in FA in these individuals.
All participants in the TRS group and the majority of participants in the UTRS groups were receiving
clozapine at the time of scanning. Previous studies have associated both a reduction in white matter
volume (Molina et al., 2005) and increase in FA (Ozcelik-Eroglu et al., 2014) with the use of
clozapine. As our results demonstrate lower FA in those on clozapine monotherapy and similar levels
of FA in those with UTRS (receiving augmented clozapine therapy) and FLR, it is unlikely that our
effects are driven by exposure to clozapine. However, if FA is lowest in those with TRS and clozapine
increases FA, this could be a mechanism by which clozapine improves symptoms of the disorder.
Antipsychotic dose is also unlikely to have driven the effects observed in this study. As the UTRS
group were receiving significantly higher doses of antipsychotics (measured in CPZE) compared with
both FLR and those with TRS, we ran correlations within the whole brain and significant FA clusters
to determine the effects of CPZE. No significant effects were observed in either analysis, suggesting
that the lower FA in those with TRS is independent of antipsychotic exposure.
We did, however, identify a relationship between IQ and mean FA in one of the seven clusters
(located in the external capsule) demonstrating differences between TRS and healthy controls. IQ
has been shown to correlate with white matter integrity in the external capsule in previous research
(Navas‐Sánchez et al., 2014); however, as the cluster demonstrating a significant effect contained

only 5 voxels, it is unlikely that IQ is driving the white matter differences between those with TRS
and healthy controls. In addition, the remaining clusters showed no such relationship, therefore we
suggest that the relationship between IQ, treatment resistance and measures of white matter
integrity is weak at best.
This study benefits from a well characterised cohort of participants, well matched for clinical and
demographic variables including gender, age, duration of illness, duration of untreated psychosis
and premorbid IQ. Participants taking clozapine had well-established TRS and patient groups were
stabilized on their current treatment. Inclusion of patients with mild symptoms provides us with
confidence that the differences in white matter integrity observed in those with TRS are unlikely to
be the result of more severe active symptoms in this cohort. Correlation analysis with total PANSS
scores supports this theory.
The study’s cross–sectional design imparts a degree of uncertainty about the underlying cause of
observed differences. However, these findings are in line with previous work highlighting differences
between controls and non-responders to antipsychotic therapy, suggesting the effects are robust.
Therefore, although our post hoc analyses did not survive corrections for multiple comparisons
between groups, their concordance with previous work provides a strong foundation on which a
theory attributing treatment resistance to white matter abnormalities can be built.
In summary, these results suggest that microstructural white matter abnormalities in people with
schizophrenia are more pronounced in those with TRS than those who respond well to first-line
antipsychotics and those with UTRS and that these aberrations exist despite effective treatment with
clozapine. Most critically, we have demonstrated that TRS and UTRS represent two distinct subtypes
of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. As differences between TRS and UTRS were driven by low FA in
those with TRS combined with high FA (compared to healthy controls) in those with UTRS, and
previous work in this population found disruptions in functional connectivity in this cohort, ultratreatment resistance is likely driven by different underlying mechanisms to TRS. We hope these
findings, in combination with the current literature, will encourage researchers to delineate between
treatment-resistant and ultra-treatment resistance schizophrenia in the future.

Figure 1. White matter maps showing lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the treatment resistant
schizophrenia (TRS) group compared to psychiatrically healthy controls (p < .05, FWE-corrected).
Red-yellow voxels represent regions in which FA is significantly lower in the TRS group relative to
healthy controls, overlaid on to the mean FA skeleton (green) and FMRIB58-FA image in standard
MNI-152 space (radiologic view with Z coordinates). FWE = family-wise error; MNI = Montreal
Neurological Institute.
Figure 2. White matter maps showing lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the treatment-resistant
schizophrenia (TRS) group compared to the ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia (UTRS) group (p
< .05, FWE-corrected). Red-yellow voxels represent regions in which FA is significantly lower in the
TRS group relative to UTRS, overlaid on to the mean FA skeleton (green) and FMRIB58-FA image in
standard MNI-152 space (radiologic view with Z coordinates). FWE = family-wise error; MNI =
Montreal Neurological Institute.
Figure 3. Voxel clusters in which individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) exhibited
lower fractional anisotropy (FA) than psychiatrically healthy controls or those with ultra-treatmentresistant schizophrenia (UTRS).
Figure 4. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for clusters in which the group with treatment resistant
schizophrenia (TRS) had significantly lower FA than healthy comparison subjects or those with ultratreatment-resistant schizophrenia (UTRS). Individual subjects’ mean FA values are represented by
points, with group data represented by each box - lines through each box represent the group
median; the upper and lower "hinges" correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th
percentiles). Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers (as specified by Tukey).
