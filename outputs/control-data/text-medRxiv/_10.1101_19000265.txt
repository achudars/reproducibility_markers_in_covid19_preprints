Abstract
Background: In addition to motor deficits, Parkinson's disease (PD) may cause perceptual
impairments. The role of perceptual impairments in sensorimotor function is unclear, and has
typically been studied in single-joint motions. Research Question: We hypothesized that
perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and contributes to balance impairments.
We tested 1) whether directional acuity to whole body perturbations during standing was worse
in people with PD compared to neurotypical older adults (NOA), and 2) whether balance ability,
as assessed by the MiniBESTest, was associated with poor directional acuity in either group.
Methods: Participants were exposed to pairs of support-surface translation perturbations in a
two-alternative forced choice testing paradigm developed previously in a young healthy
population. The first perturbation of each pair was directly backward and the second deviated
to the left or right (1°–44°). Participants judged and reported whether the perturbations in each
pair were in the “same” or “different” direction. This information was used to calculate
directional acuity thresholds corresponding to “just-noticeable differences” in perturbation
direction. Linear mixed models determined associations between directional thresholds and
clinical variables including MDS UPDRS-III score, age, and MiniBESTest score. Results: 20 PD
(64±7 y, 12 male, ≥12 hours since last intake of antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 NOA
(64±8, 6 male) were assessed. Directional thresholds were higher (worse) among PD
participants (17.6±5.9° vs. 12.8±3.3°, P<0.01). Linear mixed models further showed that higher
thresholds were associated with MDS UPDRS-III score (P<0.01), and were associated with
poorer balance ability among PD participants (P<0.01), but not among NOA participants
(P=0.40). Significance: Perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and may contribute
to impaired balance and falls.

Introduction
Deficits in somatosensory perception have been identified in Parkinson’s disease (PD) [1-8], but
their relationship to impaired balance is unclear. PD causes profound balance problems and
falls [9], resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, healthcare expense, and reduced quality
of life [10-12]. Because standing balance requires complex sensorimotor integration [13-15],
impairments in the ability to accurately sense body motion would be expected to contribute to
balance impairments. In laboratory studies using perturbation testing, balance-correcting
muscle responses evoked by perturbations are less directionally-specific in people with PD than
in matched individuals [16, 17], which could be explained by an impairment in the ability to
accurately sense the direction of body motion. Our goal was to explicitly test whether
perception of whole-body motion direction is impaired in individuals with PD, and if so, to test
whether this impairment is related to impaired balance.
Somatosensory perceptual deficits in PD have been typically investigated in single-joint tasks
[3, 7, 18-20] usually of isolated limbs [21-23]. Results demonstrate impaired perception of the
position of single joints including the ankle [20], elbow [6, 7], and index finger [25] as well as of
the rotation of the trunk [24]. Far fewer studies have examined perceptual deficits in PD during
walking and standing. When asked to estimate the height of obstacles encountered during
walking using only proprioceptive information from the feet and legs, people with PD
overestimate obstacle height, suggesting that proprioceptive feedback may be impaired [25].
Additionally, in people with PD and freezing of gait, perception of gait speed differences
between the legs while walking on a split-belt treadmill is less accurate compared to those
without freezing [26]. However, whether individuals with PD have impaired perception of
whole-body motion direction during standing remains unknown.
We previously developed a balance testing paradigm to quantify the perception of whole-body
motion direction during backward perturbations to standing balance in young healthy subjects
using a “Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing” (PEST) algorithm [27, 28]. We quantified
just-noticeable differences to lateral deviations during backward support-surface translations
while standing using a two-alternative forced choice paradigm, and identified a directional
threshold of about 10° [28]. We demonstrated that the PEST algorithm required far fewer trials

than conventional psychophysical methods, making the testing paradigm feasible in clinical
populations like PD.
In this study, we quantified directional acuity of whole-body motion during backward
perturbations to standing balance in individuals with PD, and compared it to that of matched
neurotypical older adults. We hypothesized that 1) whole-body motion directional acuity would
be impaired in people with PD, and 2) impaired whole-body motion directional acuity would be
associated with impaired balance, as assessed with a behavioral clinical balance scale in
common clinical use in PD, the MiniBESTest [29, 30].

Methods
Participants and setting
We performed a cross-sectional study of whole-body motion perception in communitydwelling individuals with PD and age- and sex-similar neurotypical older adults (NOA).
Participants were recruited from the Jean & Paul Amos Parkinson's Disease and Movement
Disorders Clinic at Emory University School of Medicine, community outreach events, senior
centers and similar venues. PD subjects were recruited from the study population of an
observational 1-year fall risk study. NOA participants were recruited for a one-time visit.
Sample size for both groups was selected to meet or exceed general guidelines of N=12
recommended for pilot studies [31].
All participants were age ≥40 years without a history of musculoskeletal and/or neurological
disorders, other than PD, sensory deficits, or dizziness. Participants with PD were diagnosed
with idiopathic PD and cleared for participation in the study by their neurologist. All
participants provided informed consent prior to participation according to a protocol approved
by Institutional Review Board of Emory University.

Study visit
Informed consent and all testing procedures were performed during a single ≈3 hour study visit.
PD participants were assessed in the practically defined OFF state [32], which is ≥12 hours after
last intake of antiparkinsonian medications. Demographic and clinical information were
collected using standardized instruments. These included Movement Disorders Society-Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts I-IV [33], MiniBESTest [34]for balance
ability, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [35]) for cognition, and Freezing of Gait
Questionnaire (FOG-Q) [36]. The motor portion of the MDS-UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS-III) was
scored from video by a movement disorders specialist (S.A.F.). PD disease duration and other
clinical information were obtained from clinical records when possible and otherwise by
interview. The number of falls over the preceding 6 months were quantified by self-report.
Antiparkinsonian medications were summarized as levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD)
according to standardized formulae [37].

Whole-body motion perception testing
Participants stood barefoot on a custom perturbation platform that translated in the horizontal
plane, wore a harness attached to the ceiling, and were attended by staff [17, 38]. Stance width
between the feet was standardized to inter-anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) distance.
Participants were blindfolded and wore headphones that played white noise to eliminate visual
and auditory feedback during testing. All testing was performed while participants were
instrumented with electromyography electrodes on the legs and reflective motion capture
markers [17, 38].
Directional acuity threshold of a whole-body motion was defined as the smallest detectable
difference of lateral deviations between pairs of sequential perturbations during standing
(Figure 1). Each trial consisted of a pair of two ramp-and-hold translations of the support
surface (7.5 cm displacement,15 cm/s peak velocity, 0.1 m/s2 peak acceleration) [17, 38]. The
first perturbation of each pair was delivered in the backward direction, causing the body center
of mass to be displaced anteriorly with respect to the ankles. The second perturbation of each
pair was delivered 0.5 s after the first perturbation ended, and deviated in a pseudo-random
fashion either to the left or to the right from the backward direction, and by an amount ∆𝜃
determined adaptively online using the PEST with identical parameters as Puntkattalee et al
[28], with an initial ∆𝜃 of +3° or -3°, an initial step size of 4°, and a stopping step size criterion
of 0.5°.
[Figure 1]
Shortly after each pair of perturbations (<3 seconds), participants judged and reported verbally
whether the two perturbations in the pair were in the “same” or “different” direction. Verbal
responses from patients with hypophonia were repeated by a nearby study staff member for
recording as necessary. During testing, participants held a small push-button device to enable
comparisons with earlier results[28]; signals from the handheld device were not examined.
At the beginning of each testing session, participants were given 4-5 practice trials to ensure
they understood the task. Trials in which participants stepped in response to the perturbation
were excluded from analysis. Convergence to threshold for right and left deviations were found

simultaneously by interleaving left and right perturbations during data collection. Up to 60
pairs of perturbations were administered to each participant, with data collection ending
earlier when the iterative step size was reduced to ≤0.5°.

Data analysis
Threshold values ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* were obtained from the left and right side of each participant and
were reclassified in ascending order of magnitude as minimum and maximum. In cases where
convergence was not reached, threshold values were estimated using a psychometric curve fit
to the PEST response data (Supplementary Materials S1).

Statistical analysis
Differences in demographic and clinical features between PD and NOA groups were assessed
with chi-squared tests and independent samples t-tests as appropriate. Additional t-tests
evaluated perceptual asymmetry between maximum and minimum thresholds in each
participant and across groups. Differences between maximum and minimum threshold values
were log-transformed prior to analysis in order to meet criteria for approximate normality as
determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Overall differences between PD and NOA in identified threshold values were assessed using
independent samples t-tests. Multivariate linear mixed models were used to further examine
the contributions of age and parkinsonian severity to the perception of whole-body motion. We
fit the following model to each of the maximum and minimum thresholds ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* :
∆𝜃#$%&'$()* = 𝛽- + 𝛽/ ∙ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 + 𝛽4 ∙ 𝑃𝐷 + 𝛽7 ∙ 𝑈𝑃𝐷𝑅𝑆 + 𝜖
Where ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* corresponds to the identified threshold value from either side of the body,
𝐴𝑔𝑒 corresponds to age in years, 𝑃𝐷 is a dichotomous variable coding the presence of PD, and
𝑈𝑃𝐷𝑅𝑆 specifically represents MDS-UPDRS-III (motor examination) score. MDS-UPDRS-III
scores were centered about zero prior to entry in linear mixed models.
To test hypothesis 1: whether whole-body motion directional acuity is impaired in people with
PD, the null hypothesis 𝛽4 = 0 was evaluated with an F-test.

To test hypothesis 2: whether impaired perception of whole-body motion direction is
associated with impaired balance deficits, we constructed linear mixed models that regressed
observed MiniBESTest scores onto observed threshold values, with interaction terms that
allowed for different regression coefficients among the NOA and PD groups. Separate models
were constructed for each of the maximum and minimum thresholds, structured as follows:
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝐵𝐸𝑆𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 𝛽- + 𝛽/ ∙ ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* + 𝛽4 ∙ 𝑃𝐷 + 𝛽7 ∙ 𝑃𝐷 ∙ ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* + 𝜖
To test whether impaired perception of whole-body motion direction was associated with
balance deficits, we evaluated the following null hypothesis using F-tests. First, to test whether
impaired perception was associated with balance deficits among NOA, the reference group, we
evaluated 𝛽/ = 0. Second, to test whether impaired perception was associated with balance
deficits among PD, we evaluated 𝛽/ + 𝛽7 = 0. Finally, to test whether associations were
significantly different among the NOA and PD groups, we evaluated 𝛽7 = 0.

Additional analyses
Additional analyses were performed, including analyses of: 1) Differences in threshold values
between PD/NOA participants and existing data of young healthy adults [28], 2) Clinical and
demographic features associated with failure to complete testing protocol, and, 3) Clinical and
demographic features associated with incomplete threshold convergence during the testing
protocol, 4) Associations between MDS-UPDRS-III motor symptom asymmetry [39] and
threshold values, and, 5) Whether direction threshold magnitude influenced the likelihood of
convergence (Supplementary Materials S1).

Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of PD (N=20, 12 male, age 64±7 y, disease duration
8±5y) and NOA groups (N=12, 6 male, age 64 ± 78 y) are summarized in Table 1. No significant
group differences were identified between PD and NOA in sex, age, height, weight, or MoCA
score. Age ranges were 56–80 (PD) and 56–81 (NOA). PD patients had significantly poorer
performance on MiniBESTest (3.5 points, p=0.0018). Average MoCA scores were indicative of

normal cognition (>27) in both groups. 19/20 PD participants were prescribed antiparkinsonian
medications at the time of enrollment; 1 participant had not yet begun pharmacotherapy.
In addition to these participants, testing was attempted but not completed in N=14 additional
participants (N=10 PD, N=4 NOA), due to: fatigue (N=4 PD); inability to tolerate headphones
and blindfold (N=4 PD, N=1 NOA); inability to understand instructions (N=1 PD, N=2 NOA), and
testing equipment malfunction (N=1 PD, N=1 NOA). Neither the frequency of nor the reasons
for early termination varied across groups (P=0.50 and P=0.28, respectively). Inability to
complete testing was associated with increased age (p=0.02) and impaired MiniBESTest
performance (p=0.017) but not with presence of PD (p=0.44) or other variables related to PD
severity (Supplementary Materials S1).

Whole-body directional acuity is impaired in PD
Independent samples t-tests showed that directional acuity thresholds were significantly larger
in PD vs. NOA (maximum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* , 17.6±5.9° vs. 12.8±3.3°, p=0.016; minimum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* ,
13.5±4.0° vs. 9.67±2.9°, p=0.008; Figure 2A,B). Differences between maximum and minimum
∆𝜃#$%&'$()* were statistically-significant for both groups (p<0.001). No group differences in this
perceptual asymmetry were identified (p=0.66).
[Figure 2]
Linear mixed models showed that the presence of PD, and PD severity as measured by MDSUPDRS III, were both significantly associated with impaired perception of whole-body motion
(maximum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : PD presence, p<0.001, PD severity, p<0.01; minimum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : PD
presence, p<0.01, PD severity, p<0.01). No significant effects of age were identified (maximum
∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : p=0.32, minimum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : p=0.82) (Table 2).
In ten participants who completed the planned testing protocol (N=7, PD; N=3, NOA), the
algorithm failed to “converge” – to settle upon a final measurement for threshold value – on
one side during the allotted time. These threshold values were estimated using a psychometric
curve fit to the PEST response data (Table S1). The frequency of convergence failure did not
vary across groups (p=0.71). No statistically-significant associations were identified between

convergence failure and any clinical or demographic variables examined. The strongest
potential association was with impaired MiniBESTest performance (p=0.22; Supplementary
Materials S1).

Worse balance is associated with impaired directional acuity among
PD but not NOA participants
Linear mixed models examining associations between MiniBESTest score and directional acuity
identified statistically-significant group×threshold interaction terms for both maximum
(p=0.017) and minimum (p=0.007) ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* (Figure 3A,B). Among PD participants,
associations between MiniBESTest score and directional threshold were -0.40 points/°
(p<0.001) and -0.53 points/° (p=0.002), respectively (Table S2). No statistically-significant
associations between directional perception and MiniBESTest score were identified among
NOA (p>0.43; Supplementary Materials S1).
[Figure 3]

Impaired directional acuity in people with PD is associated with
symptom severity
Additional linear mixed models were implemented to more precisely determine associations
between whole-body motion perception and PD severity, as measured either by MDS- UPDRS
III score or by disease duration. Among PD participants, impaired perception of whole-body
motion was associated with more severe MDS UPDRS III scores (maximum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : p=0.002;
minimum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : p=0.063; Figure 4A). Positive, but statistically-insignificant associations
were observed between threshold values and disease duration (maximum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : p=0.271;
minimum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* : p=0.770; Figure 4B). No significant differences were identified between
thresholds on the more or less affected sides (p=0.74; Supplementary Materials S1).

Discussion
Here we identified a new functional perceptual deficit that may lead to falls in PD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study investigating whole-body directional perception during
standing in people with PD. Consistent with prior work demonstrating altered
somatosensation, nociception, thermal sensation, and proprioception in PD [40], we show that
directional acuity to whole-body motion imposed by support surface translations is also
impaired. This perceptual deficit is significantly correlated with overall parkinsonian symptom
severity, as determined by OFF medication MDS-UPDRS-III score, providing evidence that it
may be associated with dopamine loss. This perceptual deficit is also significantly correlated
with impaired balance among participants with PD, but not among NOA, supporting the
hypothesis that it could represent an underlying cause of impaired balance in this population.
Taken together with data from an earlier report in young healthy individuals, these data show
that directional perception of whole-body motion is affected by PD, but probably does not
appreciably decline over healthy aging. We found no effect of age on directional perception in
our current sample, which was limited to ages 56–82. We also found no significant differences
between the current healthy sample and existing data of a young healthy sample
(Supplementary Materials S1). However, we did find that individuals of very advanced age were
more likely to be unable to tolerate the testing protocol, whether or not they had Parkinson’s
disease. It is therefore possible that directional perception could decline rapidly at very
advanced age, interfering with the testing protocol.
We were somewhat surprised to find no difference in perceptual acuity between the more- and
less-affected side of participants with PD. We found a highly-significant association between
discrimination threshold and parkinsonian symptom severity (MDS-UPDRS III score) (Figure 4),
and a comparatively smaller effect of disease duration. Previously, grating discrimination
threshold has been shown to be worse on the more affected side of people with PD [41], but the
absence of a strong lateralization effect in this study could reflect the fact that most of these
patients were ≥ Hoehn & Yahr stage 2, with evident bilateral symptoms [42, 43]. It is also
possible that this deficit may relate to axial symptoms, rather than to lateralized limb features.
Consistent with somatosensory abnormalities that can occur early in disease progression [40],

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19000265; this version posted June 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

it is possible reduced whole-body direction acuity would be more lateralized in PD patients
early in disease progression who tend to exhibit unilateral symptoms. However lateralization
may be less evident in whole-body motion perception where directional acuity likely depends
on sensory information from both sides of the body.
Our results suggest that estimates of whole-body directional acuity may be an important and
specific contributor to falls in PD. We found an association between directional acuity and
balance ability as measured by the MiniBEST test in PD and not NOA. However, in additional
post hoc analyses, we found no statistically-significant associations between impaired
directional acuity and fall history, which was available in a subset of participants (N=20;
Supplementary Materials S1). However, maximum ∆𝜃#$%&'$()* had a ≥30% stronger relationship
to history of falls than the MiniBESTest [44]. We also found that patients who were unable to
complete the testing procedure also had significantly reduced balance ability (p<0.01).
Our results are consistent with a growing body of evidence showing a variety of sensory deficits
in PD that may underlie motor impairments. Prior studies of somatosensory deficits in PD have
primarily examined isolated limbs or single joint tasks [2-8, 21, 24]. Here, we eliminated visual
and auditory inputs, requiring participants to judge whole-body motion direction based only on
somatosensory and vestibular inputs [45, 46]. The poor directional acuity in PD is consistent
with less directionally-specific activation of automatic, brainstem-mediated balance-correcting
muscle activity in PD [16, 17]. Additionally, reduced perceptual discrimination of whole body
motion direction would also impair the efficacy of attentional mechanisms used to compensate
for poor automatic balance control [47]. Similarly, deficits in body axial rotation perception
during standing [24], and impairments in perceiving leg movement during walking [26] likely
contribute to functional sensorimotor deficits.
Based on the strong association of whole-body perceptual deficits with MDS-UPDRS III score,
we speculate that directional acuity would improve with effective symptomatic
pharmacotherapy. In this study, all testing was performed ≥12 hours after intake of
dopaminergic medications. The perceptual deficit we identified here is strongly related to
overall parkinsonian symptom severity, which generally respond well to acute dopamine

challenge [48]. Several groups have also shown that impaired acuity to tactile stimuli improves
with dopaminergic therapy [40]. Improving perceptual deficits that may cause falls and other
motor deficit may be an additional benefit of careful management of “off”-times of
dopaminergic fluctuations. Further PD-specific sensory deficits may contribute to the
differences in parkinsonian fall circumstances compared to the general geriatric population [9].
