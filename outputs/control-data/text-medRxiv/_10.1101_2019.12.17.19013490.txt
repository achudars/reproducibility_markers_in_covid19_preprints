Abstract
Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite
transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it
is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty— natural, or otherwise — to ensure robustness in prediction and to
accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models
match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from
deterministic models, such as ‘breakpoints’ in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic
model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined
community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration
(MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the
filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a ‘stochastic breakpoint’ where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic
breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the ‘interruption of transmission’ independent of the ‘breakpoint’ concept where analyses
of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the ‘fade-out’ or transmission extinction
behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per
unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending
on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at
chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code
for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population
stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and
compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described.

1. Introduction
Helminthiases are a class of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that affect many hundreds of millions of humans and animals worldwide. One group of worms, the soiltransmitted helminths (STH) are especially prevalent are transmitted through the ingestion of eggs (for Ascaris lumbricoides
or Trichuris trichuria) or larvae (in the case of the hookworms:
Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). They are
estimated to affect 1.45 billion people at present [1, 2].
In recent years, mathematical models of both infectious disease transmission [3, 4, 5] and intervention impact have been
widely used in infectious disease epidemiological studies and
public health policy formulation [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Their use
in the study of the NTDs is more recent, where the variety of approaches implemented have included both deterministic [11, 7] and individual-based stochastic simulation models [12, 13, 14, 15]. Much progress in model formulation,

parameter estimation and application has been made over the
last 20 years. Model-based analyses are increasingly serving
an important role in policy formulation and the evaluation of
different control policies [16, 17, 18] as is well illustrated by
the activities of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded
NTD Modelling consortium [19]. Furthermore, following the
London Declaration in 2010, which stimulated the expansion
of large mass drug administration (MDA) programmes under
the direction of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines
on treatment strategies [17, 20, 21], mathematical models have
played an increasing role in determining how best to design and
evaluate MDA programmes [22, 23, 24].

Two key concepts emerge from analyses of deterministic
models. The first is the existence of a ‘breakpoint’ in transmission created by the dioecious nature of the worms (a male
and female must be present in the same host to ensure the production of fertile eggs and pass to the external environment and
form the pool of infectious material) which creates an unstable

is interrupted when the average female worm produces too few
offspring to ensure the continuation of the life cycle, stochastic
noise may not always result in parasite extinction in a defined
location. In this paper, we shall analyze these situations with
the use of a full individual-based stochastic model and certain
approximations to the fully-simulated outcomes. In particular
what is novel in our approach, is both looking at noise around
the breakpoint and the transmission interruption state, and assessing how the migration of infected humans influences the
likelihood of achieving effective control or even transmission
interruption by MDA.
At present the demand is for increasing complexity in models
to describe all known biological and epidemiological complexities including, for example: differing patterns of compliance
to treatment; infected human migration patterns in and out of
defined control activity regions; and various heterogeneities in
human behaviour that influence transmission. In such circumstances, the temptation is to move to ever more complex simulation models, with a concomitant growth in parameters and the
associated problems in measurement and estimation. In this paper we adopt a somewhat different approach, seeking to address
the following fundamental questions:

Unstable ‘break

point’ eq.

Basic reproductive number
Figure 1: Diagram illustrating the stable endemic equilibrium (solid black
line), unstable ‘breakpoint’ equilibrium (dashed black line) and insufficient R0
breakpoint. For reference, the transmission model illustrated is that of soiltransmitted helminth infections with the density dependent fecundity parameter
γ = 0.08 and worm aggregation within hosts parameter k = 0.3.

• How well can deterministic models match the predictions
made using stochastic simulations?

from the other stable equilibrium of parasite extinction. Independent of this breakpoint, a further epidemiological situation
arises where only one stable equilibrium exists; namely, parasite and transmission extinction where the rate of infection is always too low to sustain the parasites in the human host. In this
case transmission is interrupted, since an adult female worm
in the human host on average, produces too few offspring to
ensure one of her offspring matures in the human host to perpetuate the lifecycle. For many viral and bacterial infections
(the microparasites), this is the situation where the basic reproduction number, R0 < 1, where R0 describes the generation of
secondary cases. For the macroparasitic helminths, the concept
of R0 needs modification since it describes the average number
of female offspring, produced by female worms, that survive to
reproductive maturity by infecting a new human host and maturing within it [7].
The concept of R0 is further modified by two density dependent processes: acting on fecundity as a population regulatory
factor and acting via the dioecious nature of the worm. Because of the action of these two processes, the crtical R0 value
to sustain transmission is greater than unity in value. These two
concepts are illustrated diagrammatically in Fig. 1. Note, in
particular, how the darker red shaded region — which demarcates the R0 < 1 region — is replaced with a lighter shaded
red ‘breakpoint’ region once these density dependent processes
have been introduced.
The importance of these notions when we move from the deterministic world to a stochastic one is linked to explaining what
the interruption of transmission really appears as in a noisy
world full of variation and chance events. Even when the deterministic breakpoint is crossed, when its value is low due to high
degrees of parasite aggregation in the human host (see Ref. [7]),
stochastic noise may induce fluctuations where bounce back or
extinction occur [24, 25]. Similarly, even when transmission

• Do the concepts such as ‘breakpoints’ in transmission still
apply when stochasticity is introduced?
• How are transmission and control affected by infected human migration in a world of stochasticity?
In addressing these questions here we seek to ascertain the uncertainties that have the greatest impact on forecasts of NTD
control initiatives both to enhance the quality of predictions and
focus attention on what needs to be measured to improve accuracy.
The results described in this paper are underpinned by various analytical and numerical methods. We focus attention on
stochastic models for STH infection and control, with epidemiological parameters set to those of the two hookworm species
(Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). However,
the methodologies developed are generalizable to other human
helminth infections.
In Sec. 2 we introduce the mathematical model and formalism within which the first two main questions posed above are
answered. In Sec. 3 we then extend this formalism to include a
model for MDA control and infected human migration between
reservoirs of infection, which we then use to answer the third
question above. Lastly, in Sec. 4 we conclude with a summary
of our findings and a discussion of future work.
2. A stochastic individual-based model
Following past publications [12, 23], the STH transmission
model we introduce here is a stochastic individual-based analogue to the deterministic original given in Refs. [26, 11, 7].

from n = 1 to N j individuals within the j-th age bin

For a recent review of stochastic STH models and their predictions concerning tramsmission dynamics and control impact,
see Ref. [23].
Consider an ensemble of Poisson walkers, each representing
individual worm hosts within a community, and each assigned a
worm uptake rate λ jn Λ j (t) (or the ‘force of infection’) for the nth individual within the j-th age bin, where one initially draws
human predispositions to worm uptake from a unit-mean and

2.1. Our computational implementation in brief
We have developed a new stochastic simulation code for
helminth transmission based on the model defined above. This
code comes in the form of a publicly-available open-source
python class: helmpy, which includes features to incorporate
any population stratifications, models of control with MDA,
inter-cluster human migration (building from earlier work in
Refs. [27, 28]) and an interactive notebook tutorial for calculating all of the quantities discussed in this paper.2 This code
will also be extended to include the other helminths in the future.
The individual-based stochastic model implemented in the
helmpy code follows a similar pattern to the Gillespie algorithm [29], however we also adopt a separate methodology for the mean field expansion (which we shall introduce
later) to compare the with the former, which relies on a multidimensional Langevin solver, i.e., numerically evolves many
coupled drift-diffusion processes simultaneously — see, e.g.,
Ref. [30].
The code is written in a (mostly) vectorised implementation
of the python programming language. To provide a benchmark
for the performance, we note here that a single individual-based
stochastic realisation of the code which implements multiple
MDA treatment rounds and migration between 40 clusters of
500 people (each cluster corresponding to a different infectious
reservoir) requires ∼ 20 minutes to run for 100 years on a laptop
with a 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 4GB of memory.

depends on the total number of worms w jn (as opposed to the
just the number of females) in the n-th individual within the
j-th age bin. Throughout we shall assume that the standard
exponential relationship for STH which takes into account the
density dependent fecundity of worms z ≡ e−γ [7, 11, 26] is set
to γ = 0.08, unless otherwise stated.
Now let us build a corresponding Poisson process in the opposing direction to model the worm and human deaths, given
by rates µ1 and µ. In such a model, the total mean worm burden
m(t) is defined as a weighted sum over the mean worm burdens
within each age bin m j (t) (with Na age bins in total) — which
itself is the average over the individual worm burdens

2.2. The approximate worm burden distribution
Stochastic individual-based simulations of STH transmission
seek to incorporate a range of uncertainties into the populationlevel dynamics of the host-parasite interaction. It is interesting to note that these may typically be categorised into either
one, or all, of three important biological/epidemiological components:

1. Uncertainty in predispositions of people (i.e. the specific
chance of a particular group of people having their predispositions to STH infection drawn from a probability distribution), i.e., finite population uncertainty induced by specific samples of realisations.
2. Uncertainty in precisely when new infections, resulting in
new worm acquisition, or worm/host deaths, resulting in
worm loss, occur, i.e., dynamical uncertainty about precisely when events occur.
3. Uncertainty in the demographic parameters and initial
conditions of the given human community (or ‘system’)
under consideration, i.e., either prior or posterior uncertainty on the initial conditions.

It is straightforward to derive a master equation which governs the out-of-equilibrium behaviour of the n-th individual’s
(in the j-th age bin) worm burden distribution as a function of
time P(w jn , t). This is

where one recognises the solution as an inhomogeneous Poisson walker w jn (t) ∼ Pois[w jn (t); I jn (t)] with intensity (for the
explicit derivation, see Appendix A)

One may average over the above forms of uncertainty either
individually, or in combination. In particular, to obtain the dynamics corresponding to deterministic models of STH transmission, one must average over the first two — which we shall
hereafter refer to as an ‘ensemble average’. The ensemble average of Eq. (2) may be written as

has been derived in numerous Refs. [26, 11, 7]. Note that we
have also defined the ensemble average over m j (t) as M j (t) ≡
E[m j (t)]. Performing an equivalent ensemble average over

where we have also used the definition of the mean worm burden in the j-th age bin given by Eq. (4). Note that in the case
where Λ j (t) is roughly constant for all time, the timescale for
the distribution to achieve stationarity is ∆tstat ' 1/(µ + µ1 ).
Note that by assuming that the reservoir of infection Λ(t) in
Eq. (16) is deterministic in time and averaging over λ jn according to Eq. (1), one recovers the well-established [7] negative
binomial distribution for worms within hosts as the result of a
gamma-poisson mixture. In reality, of course, the sample mean
estimate for the number of infectious stages entering the reservoir in Eq. (2) will induce stochastic fluctuations in Λ(t). Estimating the amplitude of these fluctuations will be essential to
evaluating the distribution of worms within hosts in the stochastic individual-based simulation.
To begin with, we must first understand the variation in Λ j (t)
that is induced from the finite sample of N j individuals assigned
with an initial value of λ jn . The implicit solution to Eq. (2) is
given by

matching the standard theory of the mean or ‘deterministic’ disease model [7]. Note that we have also used Eq. (1) to identify E[λ jn Λ j (t)] = E(λ jn )E[Λ j (t)] = E[Λ j (t)] assuming that λ jn
and Λ(t) may be treated as independent random variables. Note
that this latter assumption is especially poor when the number
of infected individuals (predominately controlled by k and/or
treatment) is low since a limited number of individuals asserting their influence on the reservoir will lead to stronger crosscorrelations of the form E[λ jn Λ j (t)] − E(λ jn )E[Λ j (t)] , 0.
In contrast to the simplicity of computing the dynamical
equations for M j (t) above, calculating the time evolution of
V j (t) ≡ Var[m j (t)] will require knowledge of the overall distribution.

Between ensemble realisations of Eq. (18), the only source of
random variation is the sample variance in individual worm burdens when computing the value of the double sum

2.3. A mean field expansion of the system
In order to obtain a better approximation to the temporal correlations of the system, we shall perform a mean field expansion which allows us to calculate an accurate approximation to
the stochastic noise around the mean worm burden of the deterministic STH model. Let us now rewrite the value of N j m j

Note that in Eq. (26) we have performed a temporal average
(as opposed to ensemble average) over the states of the Poisson
walkers, each with intensity I jn (t) — see Eq. (17). The full
ensemble of realisations for the system, which includes a random set of values chosen for λ jn , is not strictly ergodic. Hence,
in order to assess the temporally correlated behaviour, in this
section we shall use the temporal average (with notation h·i) to
refer to drawing the random values of λ jn a priori for a given
realisation of the system — averaging over only the uncertainty
component 2. as discussed at the beginning of Sec. 2.2. The full
ensemble may then be restored subsequently by a second averaging over finite population samples (component 1. of Sec. 2.2)
a posteriori.

obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the distribution over fluctuations ξ j in time, which is

an important phenomenon which exists in the individual-based
stochastic simulation is not present in the deterministic model
— this phenomenon is known as ‘fade-out’ in the parasite population. ‘Fade-out’ is where transmission is interrupted due to
chance events, even when the underlying transmission success
(the value of R0 ) is above the level that deterministic models
predict will result in parasite persistence. In other words, values just above the transmission breakpoint of the deterministic
model may indeed move to parasite extinction, due to chance
effects.
Ordinarily in disease transmission models, the stochastic
noise approximation using Eqs. (27) and (28) may be used to
compute similar ‘fade-out’ effects to great accuracy, see, e.g.,
in an SIR model [33]. However, the presence of the unstable
‘breakpoint’ equilibrium leads to a stronger fade-out effect as
one can observe in the drift towards a zero mean worm burden
(transmission interruption) of the lower 68% credible interval
contour (and mean) in the bottom row plots of Fig. 2 with population sizes of 100 and 350, and which markedly reduces the
accuracy of the mean field stochastic approximation. A simple
Gaussian approximation notwithstanding, fade-out is a very important phenomenon of considerable practical relevance to the
prospect of helminth transmission interruption. Note that the
probability of a fade-out event also increases from very small
to large as village population size decreases, as is also shown
by the results of Fig. 2. The inability of the stochastic noise
approximation model to capture the fade-out phenomenon is
of considerable interest and is requires a more detailed mathematical description of the stochastic dynamics of the reservoir
of infection. Such work is planned for investigation in future
work.
In our analysis in this section, although we ignored age structure, its inclusion does not influence the general insights although it will influence quantitative detail. For hookworm, the
absence of age structure is not too serious, even in quantitative
terms since field studies suggest that the force of infection is
often independent of age [32]. To illustrate this point, in Fig. 3
we have plotted the C1 configuration (see Table 1) with relevant
hookworm age stucture included, where the difference between
Fig. 3 and the top left plot of Fig. 2 is very small.

demonstration in this work.

and µ2 = 26 (last three are per year)

2.4. Deterministic models versus stochastic simulations
Having established the main mathematical preliminaries, in
the analysis of our results it will be convenient to refer to specific configurations of the human heminth system (according
to initial choices of transmission parameters) to illustrate our
results more effectively. These configurations shall always include the following choices corresponding to the hookworm
timescales of: the adult worm death rate µ1 = 1/2 per year
(or an average life span of 2 years); the eggs/larvae death rate in
the infectious reservoir µ2 = 26 per year (or an average life span
of 2 weeks) and a density-dependent worm fecundity power of
γ = 0.08 [32]. We also have provided the particular choices of
parameters in the configurations C1 and C2 of Table 1. Configuration C1 has been chosen with parameters such that the
system is far from the unstable ‘breakpoint’ equilibrium as illustrated in Fig. 1, conversely, configuration C2 has been chosen such that the system is much closer to the breakpoint for a
clear comparison.
In Sec. 2.2, we stated that deterministic models of STH transmission are obtained by averaging over both of the uncertainties
in predispositions to infection and when events precisely occur
in time. As such, the first of our results regarding the relationship between the deterministic models of STH transmission and
stochastic simulations is not unexpected. The deterministic predictions for the dynamics of the mean worm burden [7] and the
mean of the mean worm burdens derived from individual-based
simulations exactly match — see, for instance, the good match
between dashed lines plotted in the left and right top panels of
Fig. 2, where we have plotted the dynamics of the mean worm
burdens in a community with parameters in configuration C1
(see Table 1) for a range of population sizes. The left and right
columns of this figure correspond to the numerical solution to
the fully individual-based stochastic simulation that we defined
at the beginning of Sec. 2 and the mean field model with the
stochastic noise approximation using Eqs. (27) and (28), respectively.
Considering the same pair of plots (top row) in Fig. 2 in
more detail we find that, for a given range of parameters, the
two methods used to generate the 68% credible intervals about
each mean value also agree to very good accuracy. This agreement is not always the case, however, as we illustrate with
the same pair of plots but with different transmission parameters on the bottom row of Fig. 2. Given configuration C2 (see
Table 1), in which the endemic equilibrium value is situated
closer to the unstable ‘breakpoint’ equilibrium, we find that

2.5. The ‘breakpoint’ of stochastic simulations
STHs are dioecious and therefore both male and female parasites must be in the same host for the female worm to be fertilized and produce viable eggs or larvae which sustain transmission. Past research in the context of the deterministic models
of transmission has demonstrated that there are three apparent
equilibria: a stable endemic state, parasite extinction, and an
unstable state termed the ‘transmission breakpoint’ which lies
between the stable state and parasite extinction [34, 35, 36].
The existence of such a breakpoint can be intuited by the above
limitations of STH reproduction when it becomes difficult to
find a male and female worm pair within an individual host
and it represents a clear target for control policies which aim
to achieve transmission interruption. As we also discussed earlier in Sec. 1 and illustrated in Fig. 1, this (dashed) breakpoint
curve in the phase plane of Fig. 1 acts as a separatrix between

Mean worm burdens

2 x 50 people 2 x 175 people

2 x 500 people

Let us define a net ‘grower’ as an individual who, given a particular reservoir of infection and adult worm death rate, is able
to accumulate more than one worm over time in a consistent
manner (an individual who is predisposed to infection). Such
individuals are crucial to the survival of the parasite in a defined
community as they provide future material to the reservoir of
infective stages in the habitat which subsequentially may grow
the number of human hosts who become net growers of infection themselves, and so on. One can typically state that if the
number of human hosts in which the parasite population grows
(net growers) is one or more in a given cluster or community of
people, then the chances of parasite extinction in the long-term
are low.
Immediately after, e.g., treatment through an MDA programme, only a limited number of infected individuals remain
in each age bin Ninf and hence are able to contribute to the reservoir in the following timesteps (until further relaxation of the
system towards some equilibrium). Using a modified version
of Eq. (20) we may infer the following estimate of the infectious reservoir contribution by those individuals into the j-th
age bin

components of ages 0-14 and 15+, where we the worm uptake rate in the case
of the 15+ group has been set to exactly 3 times that of the 0-14 group. The
observed lack of an effect may be restricted to hookworm infections where the
force of infection is often constant across age classes. This is not the case for
Ascaris and Trichuris infections [23].

the attractor basins of the stable (endemic) and exctinction equilibria.
Extensive past numerical analyses based on using the
individual-based simulation code [37, 25] strongly indicate that
the uncertainties which are inherent in individual-based simulations dominate the transmission dynamics near the deterministic breakpoint in transmission. This is especially true if the
breakpoint is close to the endemic equilibrium of parasite extinction (as opposed to the stable equilibrium of endemic infection) as a consequence of high degree of parasite aggregation in the human population [38, 7], as is illustrated by the
appearance of the fade-out effect between the top left and bottom left plots of Fig. 2. Furthermore, in the previous section,
we highlighted some limitations in the standard formulation
of deterministic models to account for the specific phenomena
of population ‘fade-out’ (or spontaneous transmission interruption) which are present in the real world due to chance effects in
population growth and decay especially when host population
densities are low. Such effects are also captured by individualbased stochastic simulation models. It may hence be reasonable
to ask whether concepts which exist in the deterministic framework are present in the stochastic simulations.
Conclusions drawn from hookworm simulation studies in
Refs. [25, 37] for a range of population sizes study thresholds in
prevalence in the range 0.5%-2% below which the probability
of transmission interruption is assessed. In particular, attaining
a prevalence below the threshold of ∼ 1% for population sizes
100-1000 leads to interruption of transmission with a high probability. In this section, we provide a theoretical argument for the
existence of this threshold as a ‘stochastic breakpoint’ which
works in a similar way to the behaviour present in deterministic
models, but accounting for some unavoidable uncertainty.

prevalence threshold, with the contrary being true below this
threshold. The plots in the left column — which correspond
to configuration C2 — the probability for the number of net
growers to be above 1 remains low even for a prevalence of
2%, which is to be expected due to this configuration’s proximity to the unstable ‘breakpoint’ equilibrium. Furthermore, from
Fig. 5, it is immediately apparent that the expected number of
growers is extremely unlikely to exceed 1 if the prevalence of
infection is lower than ∼ 1% in all cases of population number. Hence, this threshold essentially acts as a ‘stochastic breakpoint’, below which the probability of interrupting transmission
in stochastic individual-based simulations becomes very likely.
Note that caveats to our analysis here include varying the
population number well beyond the prior limits used in our
short sensitivity analysis — in such situations it is possible for
apparent thresholds to go much lower or higher, e.g., consider
the small, but non-negligible probabilities of sustaining transmission below a prevalence of 1% for much larger population
numbers than those studied here in Ref. [37]. It is important
to also mention that the approximate bound we obtain on the
prevalence as a ‘stochastic breakpoint’ applies as more of a
strict bound and hence does not exclude the possibility (or even
high likelihood in some specific configurations) of elimination
at a higher prevalence of 2%. Our discussion here is therefore
complementary (and not contradictory) to, e.g., Ref. [25].
We expect that similar conclusions apply in settings where
parasite interruption is predicted since the basic reproduction
number (R0 ) is too low to sustain transmission (see Fig. 1).
If the mean worm load is just below this critical R0 value to
sustain transmission in regions where the only stable state is
parasite extinction, there will be a probability distribution of
situations where parasite persistence occurs for a while due to
chance events which may obscure the precise location of this
threshold.
Our short analysis in this section has provided some theoretical justification for the existence of a ‘stochastic breakpoint’
which has been identified to be an important target for transmission interruption from previous hookworm simulation studies [25, 37] and our analysis may also be extended to other parasites, which shall be subject of future work.
2.6. A note on modifying the reservoir to account for ageing
In the stochastic model we have built, the effect of people
ageing over time has been neglected so far. Assuming that the
effective number of people in each age bin remains unchanged,
the passing of individuals between age bins may be fully accounted for as a reservoir pulse of the same form as Eq. (33)
which introduces new egg pulses drawn from the ( j − 1)-th age
bin and removes eggs from the j-th bin into the ( j + 1)-th bin.
The reservoir fluctuation model described above demonstrates how ageing can can only affect the system by a significant variation in k j between bins — furthermore, such fluctuations are can be shown to be damped significantly when the
age bins are much wider than 1/(µ + µ1 ) due to the relaxation
timescale of each individual Poisson walker (see, e.g., Eq. (17)).
In light of this fact, we have elected to avoid a direct description of ageing in this work without loss of generality in our

and where r+ and r− are the ingoing and outgoing the migratory
rates, respectively, and we have coarse-grained in time to obtain
the ` j (t) fluctuation amplitude with respect to the mean worm
burden — as in Eq. (20). With the effect of migration defined
in this way, the parameters of Eq. (35) may be randomly selected from any of the corresponding available age bins, and the
ensemble mean updated to account for any out-of-equilibrium
behaviour. Using a similar set of pulses, in Ref. [28] it was further shown that the migratory rate must exceed or be around the
same order as the death rate of infectious material in the reservoir, i.e., r+ , r− & µ2 , for the migration to affect the dynamics
significantly.
In Ref. [28] it is also assumed that the reservoir pulses which
arise from migration are uniform across the full ensemble of
realisations: though this captures the inherent variability due
to migration effects, it does not marginalise entirely over the
full ensemble of possible fluctuations which are captured in this
work. It is necessary in the finite population limit, then, for
such processes to be modelled by a full stochastic individualbased simulation, where we leave the possibility of an analytic
description for future work.
In light of the apparent necessity for a numerical approach,
we also point out that when using a fully individual-based simulation one may randomly draw from the worm burdens of the
individuals and compute an egg pulse amplitude using Eq. (3)
— in doing so potentially capturing the out-of-equilibrium behaviour of the reservoir during, e.g., rounds of treatment. For
the latter reason we shall adopt this approach when generating our numerical results throughout. We further note that such
an approach has also been advocated in similar models such as
those in Ref. [27].
In the bottom left panel of Fig. 2 we provided an example of
the fade-out effect which appears in standard individual-based
simulations. In metapopulation disease transmission models it
is well-known that migration effects can stabilise local tranmission, evading effects such as fade-out even when the population
sizes are small — see, e.g., Ref. [40]. By including migration
from a cluster with configuration C1 (see Table 1) into the cluster depicted in the plot with configuration C2 (with 350 people each), in Fig. 6 we demonstrate that a similar stabilisation
of the fade-out effect can also occur for helminth transmission
models, despite the especially strong fade-out induced from the
presence of the unstable ‘breakpoint’ equilibrium. As targets
for helminth elimination trials drive the prevalence in regions
closer to (and beyond) the unstable equilibrium, this is an important possibility to take note of with practical implications
should migration within a given region be of the same order or
higher as is indicated in Fig. 2. Note that in order for this effect
to be important, the migration rate needs to exceed the death
rate of eggs/larvae in the infectious reservoir, i.e., r+ , r− & µ2 ,
which is an early confirmation of the conclusions drawn from
Ref. [28], but we shall now investigate the importance of migration rates relative to µ2 in more detail by examining another

3. Extensions to the stochastic individual-based model
3.1. The effect of infected human migration
Up until this point we have not considered processes which
may modify the standard STH transmission model. Applying
control measures through MDA and the effect of infected human migration between clusters are both processes which modify the dynamics. The impact of MDA has been covered in
various recent publications [39, 25, 37], whereas, infected human migration in the context of STH transmission has only recently been addressed in the context of its impact on achieving
breakpoints in transmission [27, 28]. In the context of STH infections it is necessary for infected people to be present at a
location long enough to contribute to the infectious reservoir.
In this paper, we incorporate the migration model for STH
described in Ref. [28] into our individual-based stochastic simulation. We shall use this model to describe the consequences
that infected human migration has on human helminth transmission using illustrative examples. In Ref. [28] the relative
size of the migration rate of individual egg counts into or out of
a region (e.g., some number of people per year) compared to the
death rate of infectious stages within the reservoir, µ2 (µ2 = 26
per year for hookworm), was found to be have important implications for the effect of migration on transmission. Hence, in
all of the results on migration in this section, the migration rate
shall be quoted as a factor of µ2 to investigate the importance of
the ratio between these two parameters in the fully individualbased stochastic simulation.
The migration of infected individuals between clustered
communities represents a combination of both the finite population and dynamical uncertainty described at the beginning
of Sec. 2.2. A simple modification to the model we have introduced, which builds from the work in Ref. [28], may be considered to incorporate the effects of human migration into the
transmission dynamics: consider a compound Poisson process

gration rates to affecting transmission must exceed a threshold
of at least µ2 . Note, however that the precise number of individuals required to be contributing to the reservoir per unit time
can be substantially modified when the population number is
changed and the apparent prevalence required to trigger the outbreak transition can be much higher than 1% — typically 10%.
Therefore, it is important that we state that the stochastic breakpoint that we derived in Sec. 2.5 only applies to situations where
the prevalence of infection is lowered due to treatment, as opposed to being raised from a zero worm state due to UES migration. Such a difference in breakpoint prevalence value required
between these two scenarios is due to the greater homogeneity
in worm loads of individuals in the case of UES migration, as
opposed to the case of post-treatment where a limited number of
individuals have a large number or worms — the latter of which
is more consistent with the negative binomial reservoir approximation used to derive the stochastic breakpoint in Sec. 2.5. We
plan to investigate this apparent asymmetry in how the stochastic breakpoint applies for individual-based simulations in future
work.
Note here that for configuration C1 and a small population
number of 100, in Fig. 7 (top right panel) we see that transmission may transition to the endemic state spontaneously with a
much lower migration rate than µ2 — such an effect is due to
the additional variance induced by finite population effects and
this represents a potentially important caveat to the migration
rate threshold we have proposed above.

Migration into a cluster may also occur from an untreated external source (UES), i.e., from a location with a defined negative binomial distribution of worms within hosts and population
number that is left untreated in the endemic state. In such instances, it is also possible that the region may have previously
achieved elimination which is then reversed — an ‘outbreak’
scenario.
In Fig. 7 we have plotted the prevalence of worms within
hosts after a period of 100 years for a previously-eliminated
cluster experiencing UES migration for a range of migration
rates (as a ratio of the eggs or larvae death rate for comparison).
The transmission parameters chosen for the UES match a cluster of the indicated population size and configuration C1 from
Table 1 from which migrants move to a cluster with the same indicated population size and transmission parameters from configuration C2 in the left column of plots (configuration C1 in
the right column of plots), where the latter cluster has been initialised without any initial infections. From these plots one can
immediately see that a discrete transition occurs in prevalence
after a critical UES migration rate has been reached and that
this value changes according to population size. This transition marks the point at which the STH transmission is sustained
endemically, and hence the UES migration rate that this corresponds to is of critical importance to policy makers and implementers of STH control programmes since achieving elimination above this critical point in migration rate is likely impossible without treating the external source of migrants simultaneously.
For the larger population numbers (350 and 1000), Fig. 7 also
confirms the conclusions drawn in Ref. [28] — that critical mi-

3.2. Accounting for treatment with random compliance
To demonstrate the difficulty in achieving STH transmission
interruption with an MDA control programme when migration
of infected humans between clustered communities is in place,
even when treating all communities at once, in Fig. 8 we plot the
positive predictive value (PPV) of elimination after 100 years
having reached at least a given prevalence threshold or below
(as indicated on the horizontal axis) in a cluster with a C2 configuration (see Table 1) after 3 rounds of treatment (assuming
100% efficacy). Treatment rounds have been applied in years
15, 16 and 17 simultaneously to clusters with configurations C1
and C2 (with population sizes of 350 each), where the dashed
black horizontal line at a PPV of 1 shows that elimination is
essentially certain in the C2 configuration after treatment if no
migration occurs between the two clusters. Once again, however, we find that this PPV drops sharply as the migration rate
between clusters is increased in rate relative to the eggs/larvae
death rate in the reservoir, µ2 .
4. Concluding discussion
The control of helminth infections worldwide will require a
greater degree of monitoring and evaluation throughout 2020 to
2030 as treatment programmes strive to get to the point where
transmission interruption thresholds have been achieved. This
leads to an increased focus of research into predicting the likelihood of ‘bounce back’ once the transmission breakpoint has
been achieved. Such breakpoints are variously defined, but in

PPV for elimination

350 people

MDA coverage, and what patterns of individual compliance
to treatment will move the system close to or below the deterministic breakpoint in transmission. However, once in this
region, chance effects can result in either transmission elimination (fade out) or bounce back even when above or below the breakpoint. In practice, around the unstable equilibrium, stochastic noise induces a degree of uncertainty in outcome which must be described as a probability of a certain outcome being achieved. Deriving these probability descriptions
in terms of, for example PPV and NPV values, requires the use
of an individual-based stochastic model.
Our analyses suggest that public health workers will benefit
from determining the transmission threshold — or ‘breakpoint’
— for transmission interruption using individual-based simulations, and that theoretical calculations suggest a true prevalence target of below ∼ 1% to have an extremely high probability of interruption in a wide variety of scenarios for all the
major helminth infections of humans. The important public
health message, however, is that in a stochastic world where
chance events play a central role, nothing is certain. As such,
outcomes should be expressed as probability events. Even below the 1% threshold, however, bounce back can occur due to
chance events, where its likelihood will depend on host and parasite population size.
Infected human migration, like treatment, is an effect which
requires individual-based simulation to assess its importance in
sustaining high levels of control in the real world where much
heterogeneity exists within and between health intervention
population units in most regions of endemic infection. Analyses suggest that sufficiently rapid migration from regions with
prevalent infection can shift units in which high MDA coverage is achieved to a situation of sustained transmission. This
suggests that external processes such as inter-cluster migration
could play an important role in sustaining STH transmission.
The models suggest the existence of a near-universal critical
migration rate (up to the population number caveat discussed
in Sec. 3.1) corresponding to the death rate of eggs or larvae
in the case of STH infections in the infectious reservoir exists,
above which, simulations exhibit various behaviours. These include stabilization of fade-out effects such that infection persist; migration from a neighboring setting generating infection
bounce back in locations where infection has been well controlled; and lower PPVs for transmission elimination, proceeding treatment achieving a target prevalence of infection threshold is likely even if all clusters are being treated when migration
between locations is occurring. The key result is that migration
from an untreated external source (UES) is capable of causing
bounce back even in areas with effective MDA coverage to get
transmission close to the breakpoint once its rate equals or exceeds the death rate of eggs or larvae in the infectious reservoir.
For hookworm, this is typically around 26 infected individuals per year. As a consequence of the result above, if the rate
of infected migration exceeds or equals the defined threshold,
the PPV for elimination may be lowered even if all clusters are
treated.
Finally, public health workers will hopefully benefit from
open access to simulation models, such as our public code,

Post-MDA prevalence threshold
Figure 8: The positive predictive value (PPV) for elimination (the latter is here
defined as no remaining worms after 100 years) in a cluster with a C2 configuration (see Table 1) given that a prevalence threshold — which is varied on
the horizontal axis — has been crossed immediately post-MDA. In three of the
shown cases the C2 cluster is also experiencing migration from another cluster
with a C1 configuration (once again, see Table 1) where the migration rates
are indicated (using units of µ2 = 26 per year for hookworm). The treatment
has been applied to both clusters and is 3 rounds of MDA with a random compliance pattern of individual behaviours assumed at 60% coverage (and 100%
efficacy) in years 15, 16 and 17 of the overall 100.

general for human helminths, the indication from modelling
studies is that a true prevalence (based on the use of a very
sensitive diagnostic) of less than 1% moves the dynamics of the
system to the interruption of transmission. Defining the breakpoint and designing monitoring and evaluation programmes requires the use of stochastic individual-based models to determine this likelihood in terms of PPV and NPV values of the
probability of transmission elimination or bounce back. It is
therefore highly desirable to account for as many sources —
natural, or otherwise — of uncertainty to ensure a high degree
of confidence in the predictions made by such models. The effect of infected human migration in and out of health implementation units on control outcomes, is but one important example
of a key source of heterogeneity.
In this paper, we have sought to answer a number of questions of importance to providing reliable predictions for the
design of public health programmes for the control of human
helminth infections and their monitoring and evaluation.
Averaged quantities, e.g., the mean worm burden, are
matched well by the deterministic model to the individualbased simulations. This is an expected result conformed by
past work [12]. Stochastic versions of the deterministic models
employing mean-field approximations may be derived to predict how fluctuations in the averaged quantities vary over time.
The mean-field approximation, however, appears to fail to predict specific important phenomena accurately which exist in an
individual-based simulation; namely, fade-out effects.
Our analyses suggest that deterministic models of STH (and
other helminth) transmission provide important general guidelines to making predictions of what level of control, such as

and other helminths, though some simpler approximate descriptions exist under certain assumptions [28]. In future work, we
plan also to extend the helmpy package to include features for
likelihood-based inference for parameter estimation from epidemiological data in given settings.
The models suggest the existence of a near-universal critical
migration rate (up to the population number caveat discussed
in Sec. 3.1) corresponding to the death rate of eggs or larvae
in the case of STH infections in the infectious reservoir exists,
above which, simulations exhibit various behaviours. These include stabilization of fade-out effects such that infection persist; migration from an neighboring setting generating infection
bounce back in locations where infection has been well controlled; and lower PPVs for transmission elimination, proceeding treatment achieving a target prevalence of infection threshold is likely even if all clusters are being treated when migration
between locations is occurring. The challenges for future work
on migration impact on the likelihood of achieving transmission
breakpoints, lie in good measurement of both the heterogeneity
of MDA coverage over time in adjacent health implementation
units and migration patterns between such units.

Appendix B. Approximate ensemble mean and variance of the mean worm burden
The approximate mean and variance of Λ j (t) may be computed by inserting Eqs. (22) and (23) into Eq. (20) and its square,
yielding the following equations

The ensemble variance of m j (t) may also be deduced as
