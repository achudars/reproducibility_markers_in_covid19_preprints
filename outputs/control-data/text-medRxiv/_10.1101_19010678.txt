Abstract

30

Background. Despite extensive efforts to prevent recurrent Aedes-borne arbovirus epidemics, there

31

is a steady rise in their global incidence. Vaccines/treatments show very limited efficacy and

32

together with the emergence of mosquito resistance to insecticides, it has become urgent to develop

33

alternative solutions for efficient, sustainable and environmentally benign mosquito vector control.

34

Here we present a new Sterile Insect Technology (SIT)-based program that uses large-scale releases

35

of sterile male mosquitoes produced by a highly effective, safe and environmentally benign method.

36

Methods and findings. To test the efficacy of this approach, a field trial was conducted in a Brazilian

37

city (Jacarezinho), which presented a history of 3 epidemics of dengue in the past decade. Sterile

38

male mosquitoes were produced from a locally acquired Aedes aegypti colony, and releases were

39

carried out on a weekly basis for seven months in a predefined area. This treated area was matched to

40

a control area, in terms of size, layout, historic mosquito infestation index, socioeconomic patterns

41

and comparable prevalence of dengue cases in past outbreaks. Releases of sterile male mosquitoes

42

resulted in up to 91.4% reduction of live progeny of field Ae. aegypti mosquitoes recorded over time.

43

The reduction in the mosquito population was corroborated by the standard monitoring system

44

(LIRAa index) as determined by the local municipality, which found that our treated neighborhoods

45

were almost free of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes after 5 months of release, whereas neighborhoods

46

adjacent to the treated area and the control neighborhoods were highly infested. Importantly, when a

47

dengue outbreak started in Jacarezinho in March 2019, the effective mosquito population

48

suppression was shown to be associated with a far lower incidence of dengue in the treated area (16

49

cases corresponding to 264 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) almost 16 times lower than the dengue

50

incidence in the control area (198 cases corresponding to 4,360 dengue cases per 100,000

51

inhabitants).

Conclusions. Our data present the first demonstration that a SIT-based intervention has the potential

53

to prevent the spread of dengue, opening exciting new opportunities for preventing mosquito-borne

54

disease.

55

Introduction

56

Mosquito-transmitted arboviruses are the cause of substantial human mortality and morbidity.

57

Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean,

58

Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific [1]. An estimated 500,000 people with severe dengue require

59

hospitalization each year, a large proportion of whom are children [2]. The symptoms of dengue

60

include high fever, severe headaches, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rash

61

[3]. Dengue itself is rarely fatal, but severe dengue is a potentially fatal complication, with symptoms

62

including low temperature, severe abdominal pains, rapid breathing, bleeding gums and blood in

63

vomit [2].

64

Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced its intention to target

65

reduction of global incidence of dengue by 75% in the next decade [2], the apparent reality seems to

66

be heading in the opposite direction [4]. Indeed, hyper-urbanization and climate change are driving

67

the expanded range of the primary mosquito vector of dengue and other arboviruses [5–7].

68

Consequently, the high morbidity and consequent economic and resource burden on health services

69

in endemic settings is substantial and increasing [1].

70

Since specific vaccines to arboviruses have been presenting very limited efficacy and no

71

treatments are available other than management [8], the main strategy to prevent the outbreak of

72

epidemics still remains the control of the mosquito vectors, with the Ae. aegypti mosquito being by

73

far the most common and efficient vector of dengue [9]. However, the traditional methods of vector

74

control, such as the mechanical removal of potential breeding sites for mosquitoes and the use of

75

insecticides [10], have been shown to be insufficient to prevent disease outbreaks, as has been

76

evidenced by the continued rise of dengue incidence [4]. This has created an urgent need for

77

alternative solutions to vector control.

78

Several biological paradigms for efficient Ae. aegypti control have created an interest both in

79

the scientific and public-health communities over the past few years. One of these is the Sterile

80

Insect Technique (SIT), which is based on the massive and continuous release of sterile male

81

mosquitoes that mate with the wild females. Subsequently, these females do not generate viable

82

offspring, which results in the gradual reduction of the local mosquito population [11]. As a method

83

of insect control, SIT has several fundamental advantages, the most important of which is that, by

84

definition, it provides species-level specificity, with no off-target effects [12]. In addition, another

85

advantage of SIT programs is that there is virtually no risk of selecting resistant mosquito

86

populations, which is one of the main criticisms related to chemical control (insecticides) [10].

87

Several SIT-based vector programs have already been shown to suppress mosquito

88

populations in field studies [13–15]. Although SIT programs for vector control are well-known in the

89

scientific community for many years [11], there are several fundamental limitations that preclude

90

their wide implementation. The sterilization of mosquitoes by irradiation, for example, decreases

91

competitiveness capacity of male mosquitoes [11].

92

mosquitoes is often shunned by the population and governments, due in part to fear of gene flow

93

from released GM mosquitoes into the local gene pool [16]. Also, the technique based on

94

cytoplasmic incompatibility (Incompatible Insect Technology – IIT), which utilizes mosquitoes

95

infected with Wolbachia bacteria, seems to present several vulnerabilities, including the reduced

96

competitiveness induced by some Wolbachia strains, risk of population replacement, selection of

97

virus resistant to Wolbachia, and also limitations related to scaling up [13,17,18]. Above all, no such

98

program has ever been able to directly demonstrate prevention of the spread of dengue or other

99

arboviruses [13–15].

100

Herein we present a new and environmentally benign vector control intervention. This

101

intervention comprised a series of actions implemented over one year in a Brazilian town

102

(Jacarezinho) and included releases of sterile male mosquitoes (Natural Vector Control Mosquitoes-

103

NVC) produced from the locally acquired Ae. aegypti mosquito population. The results of this

104

intervention offered the first evidence that a SIT vector-control program can dramatically reduce the

105

spread of dengue.

106
107

Methods

108

Establishment of local Ae. aegypti mosquito colony

109

Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from Jacarezinho were obtained via a field collection of eggs from the

110

Aedes genus, using ovitraps distributed in several locations in the city of Jacarezinho in 2017. Ae.

111

aegypti males and females from this F0 generation were mated and the females could individually

112

lay their eggs. Then, all females that laid eggs from this F0 generation were collected and analyzed

113

for the presence of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, using a Real-time PCR method

114

(Multiplex Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika virus, Genesig, USA). No infected females were detected

115

and the eggs from these confirmed pathogen-free females were used to establish the mosquito colony

116

of the Jacarezinho strain.

117

All the mosquitoes used in the study were reared in the Insectary of Forrest Brasil Tecnologia

118

Ltda. located in Araucária city, in the state of Paraná, Brazil, and following all the biosafety

119

parameters required for the process as defined by Environmental Institute of Paraná (IAP). The basic

120

mosquito growth protocol and massive production of eggs was based on Rutledge et al. 1964 [19],

121

with modifications. Briefly, freshly hatched larvae were placed in rearing trays and fed with

122

commercially available alevin fish food (Supra Alevino), according to a predetermined regime to

123

enable similar development for all production batches. Adult mosquitoes were fed on 10% sugar

124

solution and kept at 26-28oC, 70-80% relative humidity and a 12:12 photoperiod. For massive

125

production of eggs, adult females were mated with male mosquitoes (3 females: 1 male ratio) for

126

three days and then fed with defibrinated sheep blood (Laborclin) using artificial feeders.

127
128

Production of NVC sterile male mosquitoes

129

NVC mosquitoes were produced using a method that incorporates the use at the larval stage

130

of specific dsRNAs, which targets the gene AAEL013723-PA, encoding a polypyrimidine tract

131

binding protein (PTB) [20] and treatment with thiotepa at the pupal stage.

132

NVC sterile male mosquitoes used in all the experiments that were conducted under

133

laboratory and semi-field conditions were produced as follows; the production process started by

134

hatching Ae. aegypti eggs in 3 L dechlorinated water containing 150 mL of aged water and 0.15 mg

135

fish food /ml at 26º - 26,5ºC, for an overnight period. Subsequently, groups of one hundred first

136

instar larvae were treated with a food formulation containing 1 mg of PTB-1 dsRNA (Table 1), 120

137

mg of yeast and 60 mg of fish food encapsulated in 1.2% (W/V) of sodium alginate particles. Larvae

138

were fed with this formulation until they reached the third instar development phase. Then, third

139

instar larvae were fed until the pupal stage with a second formulation, composed of 10 µg/mL of

140

PTB-2 dsRNA (Table 1), 450 µL of PEG 20% (Polyethylene glycol 4000, Sigma), 200 µL of 0.01

141

g/mL Chitosan and 180 mg of Bovine Liver Powder encapsulated in 1.2 % (W/V) sodium alginate

142

particles. To complete the sterilization process, a final step was performed after mechanical sorting

143

of male and female pupae (Larval-Pupal Separator, Model 5412, John W. Hock Company, Florida,

144

USA). Females were discarded, and males were kept in a 0.1% thiotepa solution, overnight, then

145

extensively washed in acidified water (pH 3). Male pupae were finally placed in cages to emerge.

* Both dsRNA sequences used in this study were either produced internally by in vitro transcription
(Megascript kit, Ambion) or provided by AgroRNA (Seoul, Korea).

153

several modifications necessary to adapt the protocol for large-scale production. These modifications

154

included the higher number of larvae treated per batch and the reduction of dsRNA concentration

155

during the first phase of NVC male mosquito production. In the pupae phase, males and females

156

were mechanically sorted as described above, and all the batches of NVC production underwent a

157

quality control to detect the potential presence of contaminating females. For this, a sample of at

158

least 1,000 individuals was collected and analyzed under 10x magnification. A minimum threshold

159

for pupal sorting accuracy of 99.8% males per group was imposed. All the batches of NVC pupae

160

below this value was re-sorted until it was above 99.8%. Finally, approved batches of male pupae

161

were subjected to thiotepa treatment. For large-scale production, the time of exposure of male pupae

162

to thiotepa solution (at 0.6% W/V) was reduced to 2.5 hours, to avoid adult emergence during this

163

step of treatment. Subsequently, thiotepa-treated NVC mosquitoes underwent three steps of washes

164

to remove and inactivate any remnants of thiotepa solution that might stick to the outer surface of the

165

pupae [21]: the first with tap water (for 10 min); the second with 0.0025 N H2SO4 solution at pH 2-3

166

(for 10 minutes) and the third and last one with 1 mm NaOH solution at pH 9 (for 20 minutes). This

167

final step ensures complete degradation of thiotepa and derivatives into inert and non-toxic

168

compounds [21]. Finally, pupae were rinsed in water to remove traces of the alkaline solution and

For the field trial, NVC male mosquitoes were produced essentially as described above, with

then transferred to a container within the adult cage to emerge. After emerging as adults, NVC sterile

170

male mosquitoes were fed 10% sugar solution.

171
172

Fertility bioassay

173

To demonstrate the fertility status and competitiveness of NVC mosquitoes under laboratory

174

conditions, NVC male mosquitoes (treated group) and untreated male mosquitoes (control group)

175

were mated with virgin (fertile) females in the ratio of 1:3 (one male to three females). To test the

176

competitiveness capacity of NVC mosquitoes, NVC males were allowed to mate with virgin females

177

in the presence or absence of different proportions regular non-NVC males, according to the

178

following experimental groups: fertile control (ten untreated virgin females and ten untreated males);

179

sterile control (ten untreated virgin females and ten NVC treated mosquitoes); ratio 1:1 (ten

180

untreated virgin females with five NVC and five untreated males) and ratio 10:1 (ten untreated virgin

181

females with nine NVC and one untreated males). Three replicates from each group were prepared.

182

Males and females were kept in the cage for a period of three to five days to allow mating.

183

Following the period for mating, females (from both fertility and competitiveness assays)

184

were submitted to the steps of blood feeding, oviposition, embryonic development, hatching and

185

counting. Details of the protocol can be found in the supplementary information (appendix S1).

186
187

Semi-field trial

188

A semi-field experiment was carried out to test NVC male mosquitoes' ability to compete

189

with the wild male mosquitoes in ambient settings. The experiment was performed using a cage

190

system that allowed mosquitoes to be exposed to local environmental conditions (temperature and

191

humidity) but, at the same time, kept them in a biosafety environment so they would not be released

192

into the wild. This experiment was performed in the city of Jacarezinho. Details of cage system can

193

be found in appendix S2.

194

For the competitiveness assays, NVC mosquitoes were allowed to mate with virgin females

195

inside the semi-field cages in the presence or absence of different proportions of normal males,

196

according to the following experimental groups: fertile control (fertile males only); sterile control

197

(sterile males only); ratio 1:1 (equal proportions of sterile and fertile males); ratio 10:1 (10 sterile

198

males per 1 fertile male). The distribution of each of the groups of the experiment was performed in

199

a random manner, using an Excel randomization worksheet. At the time of adult release, male

200

mosquitoes were released before females. Only after all males were released, the females were

201

released into the cages. Males and females were allowed to mate for a period of three days.

202

After the three-day mating period, a blood meal was provided for each semi-field cage. For

203

this, three anesthetized mice were kept in each semi-field cage for a one-hour period, then all mice

204

used were euthanized by anesthetic over-dose. All mice used in the experiments were provided by

205

the Paraná Institute of Technology (TECPAR), after approval by the Local Ethics Committee

206

(appendix S3). Three days after blood feeding, five ovitraps were placed inside each cage [22,23].

207

Females were allowed to oviposite for a period of five days, then, ovitraps were collected and

208

transferred to the laboratory. Eggs were dried for five days to allow embryonic development and

209

counted. Finally, eggs were hatched to verify the percentage of viable larvae. For this purpose, each

210

paddle from each semi-field cage was kept in a tray with 2 L of water for 48 hours, then, hatched

211

larvae were counted. The percentage of hatching was calculated based in the total number of eggs

212

and viable larvae.

temperature of 17oC and 50 mm of precipitation) and the average temperature is 21oC. The study

220

areas in Jacarezinho were chosen based on Ae. aegypti infestation rates and historical dengue

221

epidemics, provided on a regular basis by the State Health Department of Paraná. Control and treated

222

areas displayed similar number of inhabitants and socioeconomic characteristics, based on

223

demographic data provided by the local municipality. Priority was given to neighborhoods with the

224

highest historical rate of mosquito infestation and occurrence of dengue in past outbreaks. The

225

control area was comprised of three neighborhoods which, together, correspond to an area of 81

226

hectares and have approximately 4,500 inhabitants. The treated area was also comprised of three

227

neighborhoods with 77 hectares in total and approximately 6,000 inhabitants. As shown in Figure

228

1A, the areas chosen are separated by almost 4 km. To facilitate the releases of NVC mosquitoes and

229

monitoring, the treated area was subdivided into three sub-regions (A, B and C) and microregions

NVC mosquito releases, Ae. aegypti surveillance and viable progeny

244

Seven-day-old NVC male mosquitoes were packed in cylindric plastic containers (4.2L of

245

capacity, 210 mm height, 184 mm diameter, Figure 1C), at a maximum of 4,000 per container, and

246

were fed with sugar solution until release. Mosquito releases were performed by manually opening

247

the containers as a car goes through the streets of the treated area, according to the release schedule

248

of the week. The number of NVC male mosquitoes released in each microregion were defined based

249

on the monitoring of eggs collected in these areas in the previous week.

250

The monitoring of Ae. aegypti abundance was performed through the weekly installation of

251

100 ovitraps [22,23] in the houses or in the peridomiciliar area of the residences of both treated and

252

control area. The selection of houses for the installation of ovitraps was performed in a random way.

253

For this, all the houses from control and treated areas received numbering and a draw was

254

performed, following the LIRAa methodology [24]. At least one resident of each house used for the

255

traps signed a consent form that allowed ovitraps to be installed in their home (appendix S4).

256

Ovitraps were installed and kept in the field for a period of 7 days, then removed to the laboratory

257

and replaced with new ones. Once at the laboratory, eggs collected in each ovitrap were air dried for

258

five days to complete the embryological development. Eggs were counted, and the hatching was

259

performed by individually immersing each wooden paddle in a 0.0175% (W/V) solution of fish meal

260

diluted in filtered water. The eggs were kept in this solution for 48 hours and then the larvae that

261

hatched in this period were counted and considered viable progeny.

262

To monitor the abundance of Aedes genus population in Jacarezinho, prior to the period of

263

NVC releases, ovitraps were installed in 52 points distributed throughout the town and replaced

264

weekly. The eggs from each ovitrap were hatched together and larvae were reared to adulthood.

265

Adult mosquitoes were then identified by species.

Where indicated, official Ae. aegypti infestation data was provided by the Sanitary

269

Surveillance of the Health Department of Jacarezinho according to Ae. aegypti Infestation Index

270

Rapid Survey (LIRAa). This method was developed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and consists

271

of bimonthly larval sampling of Ae. aegypti in predetermined survey points, which are a function of

272

the human population density and the number of existing buildings in the city [24]. LIRAa index is

273

expressed as percentage of analyzed buildings where Ae. aegypti larvae are found. LIRAa index

274

below 1% classify the area surveyed as satisfactory; LIRAa between 1% and 3.9%, the situation is

275

defined as "alert" and LIRAa index above 4% indicates a risk of a dengue outbreak.

276

Epidemiological data regarding dengue cases in Jacarezinho was provided by the

277

Epidemiological Surveillance of the Health Department of Jacarezinho. All the patients presenting

278

dengue symptoms were reported to the local authority responsible. Subsequently, dengue rapid test

279

(ELISA method, detection of NS1 using both IgM and IgG) was applied to each and every of these

280

patients, to confirm (or not) the dengue diagnosis. In parallel, a blood sample from each patient was

281

collected and analyzed by the Central Laboratory of Paraná State (LACEN), the regional authority,

282

for further analysis using RT - PCR MULTIPLEX and dengue serological identification.

284

Analysis of field population suppression and statistics

285

Estimation of field population suppression was performed as previously described in Gorman

286

et al., 2015 [25], with modifications. Weekly moving averages relative to the same period at each

287

control area were calculated according to the equation M = (Ta/Ca)/(Tb/Cb) – 1, where M is the

288

population change, Ta is mean larvae per point in the treated area after release, Ca is mean larvae per

289

point in control area after release; Tb is mean larvae per point in treated area before release and Cb is

290

mean larvae per point in control area before release. This was done by comparing data obtained

291

weekly against baseline data obtained across the three weeks prior to the beginning of releases. The

292

corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by a 10,000-loop bootstrap for each

293

period [25]. The CIs were calculated for the entire period of releases and for each period of seven

294

weeks. The CIs were established in R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20) (Copyright © 2018 The R

295

foundation for Statistical Computing).

296

Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) using R version 3.5.2 was performed to verify the

297

difference of viable progenies between control and treated areas over the study period. For this 29

298

weekly means of viable progeny by trap for both areas were calculated in the period when releases

299

occurred.

300

Dengue incidence from March to May 2019 ((number of Dengue cases/exposed population of

301

the area) X 100,000) were calculated for control (IDC) and treated (IDT) areas. The rate ratio (RR) is

302

the ratio between the two incidences and was calculated by using the formula RR=IDT/IDC. Values of

303

RR<1 indicate that the intervention (in this case, NVC treatment) is protective against Dengue and

304

values of RR>1 indicate that intervention is a worsening factor for Dengue. Confidence intervals

305

95% were established in R software. ANCOVA was also used to analyze the differences between

306

Dengue cases originated in control and treated areas.

307

To support the correlation between dengue cases, the mean of eggs and larvae progeny in

308

each area, a linear regression was performed. Correlation was established based on the accumulated

309

dengue cases that occurred in each area, compared to the sum of weekly mean of eggs collected and

310

the weekly mean of viable larvae, to compare this variable, the number of dengue cases was paired

311

with the data of eggs or viable larvae from 3 weeks before the dengue case was registered. This

312

analysis was performed from the first week after the NVC releases started in the treated area and

313

proceed until the end of field surveillance.

314

In addition, to better evaluate the influence of treatment and the number of viable larvae

315

progenies on the total number of cases during the NVC releases, a Multivariate Anova was

316

performed in R software. Both study areas were split to the three main neighborhoods in each region.

Based on the 29 weeks of NVC releases, a mean of viable progeny per trap for each neighborhood

Sterility of NVC male mosquitoes does not affect their competitiveness capacity

323

One of the problems of SIT is related to the method of sterilization of male insects, since

324

several of the available techniques potentially affects the fitness of mosquitos and compromises their

325

competitiveness capacity. To evaluate the impact of sterilization in NVC males, laboratory and semi-

326

field tests were conducted to demonstrate the sterility and competitiveness of NVC mosquitoes. The

327

laboratory-scale fertility bioassay using NVC male mosquitoes showed that they are unable to

328

generate viable offspring after copulating with virgin females reared under similar conditions (Figure

329

2A and 2B). Although these results suggested that NVC are sterile, it is possible that this outcome is

330

due to an inability of male mosquitoes to mate with females. Therefore, additional tests were

331

performed to evaluate the ability of NVC to copulate and compete with normal fertile mosquitoes.

332

As shown in Figure 2C and 2D, NVC male mosquitoes are able to compete with wild males when

333

subjected to competitive assays using different ratios of sterile males to fertile males. To demonstrate

334

that NVC mosquitoes were also competitive when exposed to field environmental conditions, a

335

semi-field trial was conducted in the city of Jacarezinho. The results show that NVC mosquitoes

336

were equally competitive with non-sterile mosquitoes under semi-field environmental conditions and

337

proportionally suppressed the viable progeny of the next generation (Figure 2E and 2F).

The field study was carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the method in suppressing the
wild mosquito population.

Community outreach was started in Jacarezinho already back in 2017 (appendix S5), and

369

NVC mosquitoes were released starting from September 2018 to mid-April 2019. As already

370

mentioned, this city was chosen, among other reasons, for presenting a history of dengue epidemics.

371

The abundance of Ae. aegypti in Jacarezinho was monitored throughout 2017 and early 2018. As

372

expected, peaks of mosquito infestation were during the hottest and wettest months of the year (from

373

November to March) (Figure 3A).

394

The total number of NVC male mosquitoes released during the intervention period was

395

calculated to be 12,335,200 and the number of NVC male mosquitoes used in each release is shown

396

in Figure 3B. It is important to emphasize that the intention is to release only males, and not female

397

mosquitoes, since it is the females that bite and potentially potentiate the spread of dengue and/or

398

other arboviruses. Even though female mosquitoes reared in Forrest Innovations' facility are

399

pathogen-free, if released in enough numbers in an area where there is an ongoing epidemic, they

400

could potentially contribute to local disease transmission. Therefore, each batch of sterile males

401

underwent a quality control to detect the potential presence of contaminating females (Figure 3B).

402

Furthermore, to verify that NVC male mosquitoes remain viable and competitive after being

403

released in the field, BG traps were installed in control and treated areas to recapture adult

404

mosquitoes, including the NVC male mosquitoes. Although it is not possible to visually differentiate

405

NVC mosquitoes from wild males, the fertility status showed that a high percentage of recaptured

406

males was sterile, indicating that NVC mosquitoes remain viable, yet sterile, in the field at least one

407

week after release (appendix S6).

408

To quantify the suppression effect of NVC male mosquito releases on the Ae. aegypti field

409

population we used the method of weekly moving averages [25]. According to the established

410

confidence intervals, weekly moving averages showed that treatment with NVC male mosquitoes in

411

the treated area reduced the field population up to 91.4% (week 21 after beginning of NVC releases)

412

compared to the mosquito population of the control area (Figure 3C). Our results on suppression of

413

the local mosquito population are in accordance with the official Ae. aegypti infestation data

414

provided by sanitary surveillance authorities. This survey is carried out continuously by the Ministry

415

of Health of all Brazilian cities and is based on LIRAa index [24]. LIRAa index expresses the

416

percentage of buildings that were positive for the presence Ae. aegypti larvae. As can be seen in

417

Figure 3D, which indicates the LIRAa index in some neighborhoods of Jacarezinho, high Ae. aegypti

418

infestation rates were found in the both control and treated areas before implementation of the NVC

419

male mosquito release program. Most of these neighborhoods presented LIRAa index above 5%, and

420

in some of them LIRAa was above 15%. As defined by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, an index

421

above 4% classifies the monitored area as being at imminent risk of a dengue outbreak. Remarkably,

422

6 months after the beginning of the NVC releases, the treated area presented a drastic decrease in the

423

rates of infestation of Ae. aegypti (from more than 15% to 0 – 2·5%), which placed these

424

neighborhoods in a classification of a "satisfactory" situation. On the other hand, in neighborhoods

425

of the control area, the LIRAa index continued to be extremely high and indicative of a risk of an

426

imminent dengue outbreak, which indeed manifested in early March 2019. It is noteworthy that the

427

neighborhoods immediately adjacent to the treated area also presented a high LIRAa index (more

428

than 15%).

430

Suppression of Ae. aegypti mosquito population by NVC males was associated with lower

431

incidence of dengue in the treated area

432

Both treated and control areas presented a high incidence of dengue cases in 2010, 2011 and

433

2015 (Figure 4 A-C). In early March 2019 an outbreak of dengue began in Jacarezinho. During the

434

period of NVC releases (from week 1 to 29, equivalent to October 3rd, 2018 and April 17, 2019,

435

respectively), 293 confirmed dengue cases were reported in the entire city, and from this total, 109

436

cases (37.2%) originated in neighborhoods of the control area. In contrast, only 8 cases of dengue

437

(2.7%) were reported in the neighborhoods treated with NVC male mosquitoes (Figure 4, panels D

438

and D’). The clustering of dengue cases in several locations in the control area, as well as the rapid

439

weekly increase is indicative of a high level of local transmission by mosquitoes. In contrast, the 8

440

cases reported in the treated area were sporadic and static during the period of NVC releases. On

441

week 35, six weeks after the end of NVC male mosquitoes’ releases (Figure 4, panel E and E’) the

442

accumulated number of dengue cases originated in the treated area remained much lower (16 cases)

443

when compared to the control area (198 cases). As described in the Methods section, a blood sample

444

for all the patients was collected to confirm the infection with dengue virus, both through serological

445

and molecular analysis (RT-PCR Multiplex). The list of dengue cases based on their registered place

446

of residence until the end of May, 2019 (week 35) can be found in appendix S7. In fact, the

447

incidence of dengue in the control area during the entire period analyzed, from week 1 to 35 was

448

4,360 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, while the incidence of dengue in the treated area, in the same

449

period, was only 264 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, which is almost 16 times lower than the dengue

450

incidence in the control area. The Rate Ratio, which is the ratio between dengue incidence of the

451

treated area and the control area, was 0.0606 (95% CI 0.0364-0.1006), indicating that the treatment

452

with NVC had a protective effect for residents of the treated area in terms of dengue. Corroborating

453

this, ANCOVA analysis showed that the difference between dengue cases in treated and control

454

areas was statistically significant (appendix S8).

September 28, 2018 and April 22, 2019 (weeks 1 to 29), on a weekly basis. Eggs collected from the

area (gray bars) and treated (red bars) were provided by the Parana Health Department and are

shown on the Y axis on the right. The incidence of dengue in control area (IDC) was 4·36% (95% CI

483

linear regression analysis showed that the increase in the number of dengue cases is related both to

484

the mean of eggs collected and viable larvae per week. For both study areas significant p values were

obtained, in the control area p=4.551e-06 and p=2.496e-06 for eggs collected and viable larvae,

respectively. In the treated area p=1.824e-05 and p=9.058e-07 for eggs collected and viable larvae

mean, respectively, evidencing the dependence between these variables (appendix S8). Then, a

488

Multivariate Analysis (MANOVA) was performed to confirm this correlation (appendix S8). This

489

analysis was based on mean number of viable larvae from eggs collected in the control and the

490

treated areas during NVC releases and the number of dengue cases that originated in both areas in

491

this period (Figure 4F). The analysis showed a strong influence of NVC treatment in reducing

492

dengue cases (p value = 0.0025), which corroborates that the NVC releases has the potential to

493

prevent dengue outbreaks (appendix S8).

Discussion

496

Jacarezinho is a town with about 40,000 inhabitants. It experienced several dengue outbreaks

497

in the last decade, most notably in 2010, 2011 and 2015. The geographic distribution of dengue cases

498

in those past epidemics shows that both the control and treated areas presented the greatest number

499

of cases in the town, and that overall, the proportion of cases in the treated area was slightly higher

500

(Figure 4A-C). We set out to perform our study by targeting these neighborhoods for the release of

501

the NVC sterile mosquitoes starting in September 2018 (week 1). As is common in such real-world

502

circumstances [13], it was not logistically possible to use statistical methods to predetermine sample

503

sizes, to randomize the experiments or to blind the investigators.

504

The first case of dengue in Jacarezinho was confirmed in the beginning of March 2019 (week

505

23) and the total number of cases increased until April 24th 2019 (week 29, end of the NVC male

506

mosquito release period) with 293 confirmed dengue cases. Out of these, 109 cases were reported in

507

the control region, whereas only 8 cases were reported in the treated area. This difference of more

508

than 90% between the number of dengue cases in the treated and control areas continued even 6

509

weeks after the total cessation of NVC male mosquito releases and demonstrates the success of our

510

511

formal risk of dengue epidemic in Jacarezinho was declared by the local authorities, and by the end

512

of May 2019 (week 35), a formal epidemic was confirmed, with 586 cases reported in total, 198 of

513

which were in the control region (similar proportion of cases to past epidemics), whereas the treated

514

region had only 16 cases (dramatically lower incidence compared with past epidemics). The details

515

of the cases distribution are provided in appendix S7.

516

The data we present herein shows that an effective integrated SIT intervention plan can

517

dramatically reduce the mosquito infestation of Ae. aegypti. Strikingly, the mosquito infestation

518

index of the treated neighborhoods remained very low even though the directly adjacent

519

neighborhoods were found to have very high mosquito indices in the LIRA survey. This underscores

520

the robust nature of our NVC male mosquito intervention, since past studies have found significantly

521

diminished effects of SIT in the "fringe areas" [13,15]. As such, allowing for such potential

522

migration our suppression results become even more remarkable.

523

Critically, we have provided the first evidence that this new environmentally benign vector

524

control intervention can potentially thwart the spread of a mosquito-borne disease epidemic. Our

525

approach is based on the use sterile male mosquitoes (NVC) that are produced from a local mosquito

526

strain and close collaboration with the local community and authorities.

527

With a dengue outbreak in the making, the local authorities could not ethically leave the

528

control region without acting. Towards the end of March 2019, they began intervention in a series of

529

reactive actions to try to thwart the outbreak and prevent an epidemic, including massive spraying of

530

the organophosphate Malathion and 'blocking' (an intervention of seeking out larvae in breeding sites

531

in a 100-meter radius around the infected case) of every resident dengue-case reported. This may

532

have impacted the results and led to a certain reduction of the adult and subsequent larvae population

533

in the control region (Figure 4F, weeks 27-29). Indeed, the incidence of dengue in the control area

534

may have been even graver had the authorities not intervened at all. Due to the near absence of

535

dengue cases in the treated area, no such reactive intervention was required. Our study directly

536

demonstrates that these highly common reactive measures that are utilized all over the world [26–29]

537

were ineffective in preventing the continued spike in the number of dengue cases in the control

538

region. Together, these data provide strong evidence that near prevention of dengue transmission in

539

the treated area is exclusively due to NVC male mosquito releases.

540

Indeed, a recent review on management of mosquito resistance concluded that increases in

541

insecticide resistance development in Aedes vectors as arbovirus epidemics proliferate underscore

542

the urgency to create Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM) programs to maintain or recover

543

vector control efficacy, and that when control strategies using insecticides are implemented, they

544

should be systematically associated with noninsecticidal tools and, when possible, replaced by

545

alternative tools to reduce the selection pressure on Aedes populations and limit the evolution of

546

resistance [30]. Herein we provide a highly effective alternative tool to thwart the spread of Aedes

547

resistance to insecticides.

548

With the lack of specific antiviral drugs to treat dengue as well as uncertainties about the

549

efficacy and safety of the dengue vaccine [8,31], integrated vector control remains the main WHO

550

recommendation for the near future [1]. It is thus striking that there is paucity of reliable evidence for

551

the effectiveness of any alternative dengue vector control method. Specifically, of the plethora of

552

SIT studies conducted to date, none was able to directly show a reduction in dengue incidence, and

553

entomological indices alone were used as end points [11].

554

One of the key factors for successful SIT implementation for mosquito control is identifying

555

a technology that induces sterility while at the same time retaining the sterilized treated males

556

vigorous and capable of successfully competing with the endemic male population in the release

557

area. Furthermore, in order to be implemented widely, such a method needs to be robust, cost-

558

effective, easily scalable, and easy to implement in remote areas where it is most needed [32].

559

Unfortunately, all the existing biological control alternatives have multiple limitations that make

560

them unavailable for immediate globally impactful implementation (Table 2). For example, RIDL

561

mosquitoes have recently been shown not be self-limited, and surviving males have integrated their

562

gene legacy into the local population [16], thus raising additional concerns beyond those that have

563

prevented this intervention from being implemented. Indeed, 10 years since it was first tested in the

564

Cayman Islands [33], there is still great difficulty in bypassing negative public sentiment to test it in

565

the Florida Keys, and its operation in Brazil has almost ground to a halt. Population replacement

566

strategies, such as the "Eliminate Dengue" program, based on Wolbachia inhibiting replication of

567

viruses, showed some success in Australia [34], but scaling up this strategy seems daunting since

568

there are multiple challenges to address such as the potential of the viruses to overcome Wolbachia-

569

mediated "blocking" [17,35], reduced fitness of multiple strain Wolbachia carrying mosquitoes

570

[17,36–38], and potential of high temperatures in some locales to constrain the ability of Wolbachia

571

to invade natural mosquito populations and block disease transmission [17,38]. Recently, a combined

572

IIT/SIT approach was hailed to almost eliminate mosquitoes using a Wolbachia-male + irradiated

573

female contamination combination to facilitate population suppression. Notwithstanding the small

574

size of the intervention areas and the large number of mosquitoes per area due to their reduced

575

competitiveness, this method is very difficult to implement on a large scale, requiring backcrossing

576

to local populations everywhere that it is implemented. Moreover, even under the very stringent

577

conditions of the trial, several WPi bearing females were recovered, underscoring the potential of

578

limited population suppression inadvertently becoming population replacement once the scope of

579

this kind of intervention is enlarged [13]. This is so because quality control for successful irradiation

580

to the females is inevitably completed only after the batch was released.

Conclusions

29

Because irradiated males
presented lower
competitiveness capacity
they are not the first choice
for SIT programs.

Medium efficacy. Recently
this technique has been
used in combination with
other techniques, which
involves additional costs for
the program.[13,46]

Poor competitive capacity
implies the need to release
greater amounts of males
High cost program (reviewed
in [17])

Medium efficacy demonstrated,
however the risk of undesired
introduction of Wolbachia is a
strong limitation of the method.

Poor competitive capacity
implies the need to
release greater amounts of
males

Potential loss of infected
mosquito population decreases
the effectiveness of virus
blocking (reviewed in [17]

High cost program:
difficult to implement in
large-scale due the
irradiation process
[17,43]

Risk of selecting resistant and
more virulent strain of virus
[17,45]

High efficacy when males
are released in great
amounts

Effective at least in a short-term,
but effects of introduction of
Wolbachia at long-term is not
known so far.

Historic public rejection, lack
of support from authorities,
long and difficult regulatory
process associated to use of
GM mosquitoes and the
recently shown gene flow
from GM mosquitoes into the
local gene pool [16]

Only one field trial
performed so far

Although mosquito
suppression is effective, the
potential environmental
impact, the history of public
rejection and lack of support
from the authorities difficult
implementation of this
method.

High effective reduction in
the
natural
mosquito
population;
Dramatic reduction in
number of dengue cases. No
environmental impact: selflimited mosquitoes; no risk
of introduction of new
mosquito strains, genes,
residues into environment.

Evolutionary changes in host
genome resulting in reduced
virus blocking even in the
presence of Wolbachia [17]

582

The process described herein to induce male sterility in Ae. aegypti overcomes all the

583

technological, logistical and ecological hurdles described above, as well as successfully addressing

584

regulatory compliance and the public concerns. We developed a treatment that is transient in nature

585

and the active ingredients do not persist in the released adult mosquito [47] (appendix S9). By

586

collecting thousands of local mosquito eggs before the start of the project, we were able to use the

587

ambient mosquito genepool to guarantee that the local climate adaptation and local female seeking

588

capabilities of the released sterile males will be optimal. By creating a colony with hundreds of

589

"founders" and thus large genetic variability, we were able to ensure that the males were highly

590

competitive and survived at least one week after their release.

591

In addition, as has been determined in previous studies, the education and involvement of the

592

community in decision making provides a crucial component in successful implementation of SIT

593

programs. A bottom-up approach that targets school workshops, community programs and total

594

transparency, was highly successful in exposing the people to the benefits of releasing sterile male

595

mosquitoes (appendix S5).

596

Dengue outbreaks are highly unpredictable, but it has been empirically determined in several

597

previous studies that a minimum mosquito-vector threshold is needed to facilitate the spread of the

598

virus in the population. Gradual mosquito population suppression all the way to over 91·4%

599

reduction from the control area that was demonstrated in this study shows the importance of

600

sustaining a continuous release program that is dependent on real-time monitoring of the mosquito

601

population. Concurrent programs run over large regions may well bring total relief from Aedes-

602

related diseases by the second year of implementation.

603

The dramatic influence on the incidence of malaria by the deployment of Pyrethroid-treated

604

bed nets underscores the ability of the international health community and Non-Governmental

605

Organizations to mobilize in order to take advantage of an effective system to reduce disease.

606

However, these efforts require the massive integrated coordinated action and funding of nations and

public organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in order to be effectively

disseminated. In order to create real impact on a global scale, local communities need to be

609

empowered to set up the infrastructure for them to be able to endorse the transformative paradigm

610

that is described herein. It is our humble hope that this communication will be the trigger for such

611

global mobilization to further test and subsequently employ NVC male mosquitoes wherever the

612

threat of dengue and other arboviral diseases is significant.
