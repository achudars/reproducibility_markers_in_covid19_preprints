Abstract

Recent findings have shown connections of ipsilateral cortico-reticulospinal tract (CRST),
predominantly originating from secondary motor areas, to not only proximal but also distal
portions of the arm. In unilateral stroke, CRST from the ipsilateral side is intact and thus has been
proposed as a possible backup system for post-stroke rehabilitation even for the hand. We argue
that although CRST from ipsilateral secondary motor areas can provide control for proximal joints,
it is insufficient to control either hand or coordinated shoulder and hand movements due to its
extensive branching compared to contralateral corticospinal tract. To address this issue, we
combined MRI, high-density EEG, and robotics in 17 individuals with severe chronic hemiparetic
stroke and 12 age-matched controls. We tested for changes in structural morphometry of the
sensorimotor cortex and found that individuals with stroke demonstrated higher gray matter
density in secondary motor areas ipsilateral to the paretic arm compared to controls. We then
measured cortical activity while participants attempted to generate hand opening either supported
on a table or while lifting against a shoulder abduction load. The addition of shoulder abduction
during hand opening increased reliance on ipsilateral secondary motor areas in stroke, but not
controls. Crucially, increased use of ipsilateral secondary motor areas was associated with
decreased hand opening ability while lifting the arm due to involuntary coupling between the
shoulder and wrist/finger flexors. Together, this evidence implicates a compensatory role for
ipsilateral (i.e., contralesional) secondary motor areas post-stroke, but with limited capacity to
support hand function.

I. Introduction

Hand function is often significantly impacted post-stroke, particularly in individuals with moderate
to severe motor impairments. This is partially attributed to damage to the corticospinal tract (CST),
which is the primary motor tract controlling the hand in healthy individuals1,2. Following damage
to the CST, individuals with stroke demonstrate increased reliance on the ipsilateral (i.e.,
contralesional) sensorimotor cortices when attempting to move the paretic arm3,4. This may reflect
recruitment of uncrossed indirect motor pathways originating from ipsilateral sensorimotor
cortices to generate motor output5. However, the question remains whether the ipsilateral
sensorimotor cortex and associated alternate motor pathways have the capacity to support hand
function.

Uncrossed cortico-bulbospinal fibers originating from the cortex ipsilateral to the moving arm,
such as the corticoreticulospinal tract (CRST), may serve as a compensatory backup system to
control the paretic arm following damage to CST5,6. One piece of evidence in support of this
possibility of post-stroke reliance on CRST comes from the finding that following a pyramidal
CST lesion in monkeys, connections between the ipsilateral reticular formation and paretic wrist
flexors are strengthened7. Importantly, these ipsilateral tracts originate predominantly from
secondary motor regions such as the supplementary motor area (SMA) and premotor cortex (PM)
compared to CST which predominantly originates from primary motor cortex (M1)8-11. Although
the innervations from these tracts originating from secondary motor areas were thought to be
limited to trunk and proximal muscles11,12, more recent work demonstrates that they also innervate
distal muscles such as the wrist and finger flexors13,14. This raises the possibility that they could

be involved in subsequent hand recovery following stroke15. However, the reticulospinal tract
branches more extensively at the spinal cord compared to the CST15-18. Consequently, these
pathways are not able to selectively activate individual muscles in the manner of CST and may not
be sufficient for dexterous hand control19.

One of the main points of evidence for compensatory use of these uncrossed cortico-bulbospinal
pathways following stroke in humans is the presence of abnormal coupling between the shoulder
and the rest of the arm and hand. Lifting at the shoulder leads to abnormal coupling between
shoulder abductors and elbow/forearm and finger flexor muscles that reduces reaching distance
and hand opening ability, termed the flexion synergy20-23. In fact, lifting at the shoulder can lead
to involuntary closing during attempted opening in individuals with more severe impairments23.
Whereas the damage to CST accounts for the weakness, or inability to fully activate muscles24,25,
it does not affect the presence of this abnormal coupling. Meanwhile, increased use of ipsilateral
cortico-bulbospinal pathways originating from secondary motor areas could account for this
coupling due to its more extensive branching at the spinal cord. This extensive branching limits
the ability for these tracts to individually activate muscles, and instead leads to activation of
multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Additionally, these pathways innervate a greater
proportion of flexor muscles compared to extensors, and stimulation of these pathways
preferentially elicits EMG activity in ipsilateral flexor muscles in the monkey12,26. Therefore,
attempting to drive movement of the arm via these compensatory ipsilateral pathways originating
from secondary motor areas may allow individuals to generate greater activity at the more proximal
portions of the arm, but at the detriment of individual joint control and distal hand function,
especially hand opening.

The goal of the current study was to investigate the potential compensatory role of ipsilateral
secondary motor regions post-stroke and evaluate their capacity to support hand function following
damage to CST. We hypothesized that individuals with a hemiparetic stroke would increasingly
rely on ipsilateral secondary motor areas as compensation for damage to the lesioned hemisphere
as the demand of the task increased, but that increased use of these areas would reduce hand
opening ability due to the flexion synergy. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed any long-term
structural changes in ipsilateral cortex using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then, cortical
activity was measured using high density electroencephalography (EEG) with measures of motor
performance in a robotic controlled environment to link cortical activity to behavior. Cortical
activity was measured during two tasks: 1. Hand opening in isolation and 2. Hand opening in
conjunction with shoulder abduction (i.e., lifting). Cortical activity was compared with hand
performance during these two conditions. We specifically examined grasping pressure as an
indicator for hand opening ability since individuals with severe motor impairment are not able to
open their hand and instead demonstrate involuntary grasping pressure when attempting to open23.
Thus, more involuntary grasping was an indicator of worse performance. We found that i)
individuals with stroke demonstrated increased gray matter density within secondary motor areas
ipsilateral to the paretic arm (i.e., contralesional sensorimotor cortex) compared to controls; ii) the
addition of shoulder abduction during attempted hand opening increased reliance on ipsilateral
secondary motor areas in stroke, but not controls; iii) increased use of the ipsilateral secondary
motor areas was associated with greater involuntary grasping (i.e., reduced hand opening ability)
due to the flexion synergy. Together, these results implicate an increased reliance on ipsilateral
secondary motor areas and presumably ipsilateral cortico-bulbospinal tracts as a compensatory

2.2 Experimental Protocols

2.2.1. Structural Imaging of the Brain

Individuals participated in MRI scans at Northwestern University’s Center for Translation Imaging
on a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head coil. Structural T1-weighted scans
were acquired using an MP-RAGE sequence (TR=2.3s, TE=2.94ms, FOV 256x256mm2)
producing an isotropic voxel resolution of 1x1x1 mm. Visual inspection of acquired images was
performed immediately following the data acquisition to check the quality of the collected images
and confirm stable head position.

2.2.2. Functional Imaging related to hand and arm

In a separate experiment, functional imaging related to hand opening with or without arm lifting
was examined using EEG. During the EEG experiment, participants sat in a Biodex chair (Biodex
Medical Systems, Shirley, NY), which restrained the trunk with straps crossing the chest and
abdomen. The participant’s paretic arm for individuals with stroke or dominant arm for healthy
individuals was placed in a forearm-hand orthosis attached to the end effector of an admittance
controlled robotic device (ACT3D) instrumented with a six degree of freedom (DOF) load cell
(JR3 Inc., Woodland, CA).

At the beginning of each trial, participants moved their hand to a home position, with the shoulder
at 85° abduction, 40° flexion, and the elbow at 90° flexion angle. The participant then received an
auditory cue. Following the cue, participants relaxed at the home position for 5-7 s and then selfinitiated either 1) a maximum attempted hand opening with the arm resting on a haptic table, or 2)
a maximum attempted hand opening while lifting against 50% of maximum shoulder abduction
torque (SABD50). Participants were instructed to avoid eye movements by focusing on a point
and avoid movements of other body parts during the performance of each trial, which was visually
confirmed by the experimenter. Participants performed 60-70 trials of each task, broken into blocks
(one block consisted of 20-30 trials for a particular task). Rest periods varied between 15 to 60
seconds between trials and 10 minutes between blocks.

Scalp recordings were made with a 160-channel High-Density EEG system using active electrodes
(Biosemi, Inc, Active II, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) mounted on a stretchable fabric cap based
on a 10/20 system. The centers of all the electrode holders were attached with reflective markers.

Simultaneously, EMGs were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis, flexor carpi
radialis, and intermediate deltoid of the tested arm to assess timing of movement onset. All data
were sampled at 2048 Hz. The impedance was kept below 50 kW for the duration of the experiment.
The positions of EEG electrodes on the participant’s scalp were recorded with respect to a
coordinate system defined by the nasion and pre-auricular notches using a Polaris Krios handheld
scanner (NDI, Ontario, Canada). This allowed for coregistration of EEG electrodes with each
participant’s anatomical MRI data. Additionally, for individuals with a stroke, involuntary
grasping pressure during the two tasks was measured by a custom pressure sensor mat (Pressure
Profile System Inc., CA) that was wrapped around a cylinder where the participant’s fingers/palm
were placed around (see Figure 3A). Although participants were instructed to open their hand,
individuals with severe chronic stroke cannot physically open their hand and instead display
involuntary grasping due to the combination of weakness of finger extensor muscles and
involuntary coactivation of finger flexor muscles23. Therefore, instead of directly measuring hand
opening ability/aperture, grasping pressure was measured and used as a marker for inability to
open the hand, with increased involuntary grasping pressure reflecting reduced hand opening
ability. At the start of the experiment, maximum grasping forces were measured for the paretic
hand, which were used for normalization purposes in the data analysis.

2.3 Data Analysis

2.3.1. Structural Changes in Gray Matter Density

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19012336; this version posted November 19, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Anatomical T1 data were analyzed with FSL voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 1.1
(https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLVBM; Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom)27
using FSL tools28. T1 images for individuals with right hemisphere lesions were flipped to ensure
that the lesions of all stroke participants were in the left hemisphere. The T1 images were then
brain-extracted using the Brain Extraction Tool and segmented into gray matter using FAST4. The
resulting gray matter partial volume images were aligned to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
152 standard space using the affine registration tool FLIRT and averaged to create a study-specific
gray matter template. Subsequently, individual gray matter partial volume images in native space
were non-linearly registered to this template using FNIRT, modulated to correct for local
expansion or contraction due to the non-linear component of the spatial transformation, and then
smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 3 mm. These gray matter images were
masked to only include the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex including primary motor cortex,
supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and primary somatosensory cortex from the Human
Motor Area Template29.

2.3.2. Involuntary Grasping Pressure

The grasping pressure was calculated as the sum of max pressure generated by the I-IV digits
during a given trial23 (see an example of the pressure generated in Figure 3B). Ensemble-averaged
grasping pressure for each condition was then normalized by the maximum grasping pressure,
which was calculated as the average of the largest 3 total grasping pressures during the max closing
trials. Grasping pressure is thus referred to as the percent of pressure during a specific task
compared to the individuals max closing pressure.

2.3.3 Cortical activity related to hand opening and hand opening while lifting against load

EEG data were low pass filtered at 50 Hz, aligned to the earliest EMG onset of the 3 muscles, and
segmented from -2200 to +200 ms (with EMG onset at 0 ms) using Brain Vision Analyzer 2
software (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany). Data were then visually inspected for the presence
of artifacts. Trials exhibiting artifacts (e.g., eye blinks) were eliminated from further analysis. The
remaining EEG trials were baseline-corrected (from -2180 to -2050 ms) and ensemble-averaged.
The averaged EEG signals were down-sampled to 256 Hz and imported into CURRY 6
(Compumedics Neuroscan Ltd., El Paso, TX). The cortical current density strength (μA/mm2) in
the time between 150 ms and 100 ms prior to EMG onset was computed using the standardized
low resolution electromagnetic brain tomography (sLORETA) method (Lp = 1) based on a
participant-specific boundary element method model with the regulation parameter automatically
adjusted to achieve more than 99% variance accounted30,31. Possible sources were located on a
cortical layer with 3 mm distance between each node. Although the inverse calculation was
performed over the whole cortex, only the activity in bilateral sensorimotor cortices was further
analyzed. Specific regions of interest (ROIs) included bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices
(primary motor cortex (M1) + primary sensory cortex (S1)) and secondary motor cortices
(supplementary motor area (SMA) + premotor area (PM)).

We used the estimated current density strengths to calculate a Laterality Index (LI = (C-I)/(C+I)),
where C and I are the current density strengths from the contralateral and ipsilateral sensorimotor
cortices relative to the moving hand/arm (i.e., combined primary sensorimotor and secondary

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19012336; this version posted November 19, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

motor cortices), respectively. LI reflects the relative contributions of contralateral versus ipsilateral
sensorimotor cortices to the source activity, with a value close to +1 for a contralateral source
distribution and -1 for an ipsilateral source distribution.
Additionally, we quantified a cortical activity ratio 𝐶𝐴𝑅 =

∑(
) '*

∑,
) '+

for each of the 4 ROIs, where Sn

represents the current density strength of the nth node, and N and M represent the number of nodes
in one of the ROIs and the whole sensorimotor cortices, respectively. The cortical activity ratio
reflects the relative strength from one ROI as normalized by the total combined strength of the 4
ROIs. When a significant effect of task in CAR was found, we further examined between-task
difference in the sum of absolute amplitude activity in each ROI. This is to justify the possible
interdependencies between regions (e.g., one region increasing in CAR can lead to a decrease in
CAR in another even if the absolute activity does not change in the second region). However,
measure of absolute activity can only be used for within-subject comparisons, due to the between
subject variance in signal to noise ratio, scalp conductance, electrode impedance, etc.

2.4 Statistical Analysis

Statistics for the GM density were computed within FSL. A voxel-wise General Linear Model
was applied with a Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement32 to detect differences in gray matter
density between individuals with stroke and controls. A voxel-based threshold of changes in gray
matter density was set at p < 0.05 (Family-Wise Error Corrected; FWE). Statistics for the
behavior and EEG were performed using SPSS (IBM, V23). A paired t-test was performed to
assess any impact on task on the normalized grasping pressure in individuals with stroke. A 2
(group) x 2 (task) ANOVA was performed on LI for the EEG analysis. A 2 (group) x 2 (task) x 4

(region) ANOVA was performed on CAR for the EEG analysis. We performed post-hoc paired
t-tests for any significant within-subject effect in ANOVA interactions. Pearson correlations
were performed between significant cortical activity findings and grasping pressure. A p value of
0.05 or less was considered significant.

III. Results

3.1 Differences in Gray Matter Density in Ipsilateral Sensorimotor Cortex

Structural differences in gray matter (GM) density within sensorimotor cortices were compared
between individuals with stroke and healthy controls. Individuals with stroke demonstrated
significant greater GM density compared to controls in two ipsilateral clusters: 1) a cluster residing
in premotor cortex (peak voxel: x = 46, y = 6, z = 50, t-value = 5.17, p < 0.05 FWE corrected;
Figure 2A), and 2) a cluster residing in primary somatosensory cortex (peak voxel: x = 48, y = 26, z = 58, t-value = 5.55, p < 0.05 FWE corrected; Figure 2B). Meanwhile, there were no regions
that exhibited significantly greater GM density in controls compared to individuals with stroke
within the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex.

individuals with chronic stroke could not open their hand off the cylinder and therefore included
them in the grasping pressure analysis. An example for one individual’s grasping pressure during
the two conditions is depicted in Figure 3C. Overall, these individuals demonstrated a significant
increase in involuntary grasping pressure (reduced hand opening ability) with the addition of the
SABD load compared to attempted hand opening on the table (t(11) = 3.16, p = 0.009; Figure 3D).
Controls were not analyzed since they do not produce any involuntary grasping pressure during
either condition, and a 50% max SABD load does not reduce hand opening ability23.

IV. Discussion

We sought to evaluate the potential compensatory role of ipsilateral (i.e., contralesional) secondary
motor regions post-stroke and their capacity to support hand function as compensation for damage
to corticospinal tract. We found that individuals with stroke showed systemic changes in structural
morphometry within ipsilateral secondary motor regions relative to the paretic arm in the form of
increased gray matter density. Furthermore, when looking at cortical activity related to the hand,

we found that the increased demand of SABD during attempted hand opening increased reliance
on the i-SMA/PM in individuals with stroke, but not controls. Crucially, this reliance on ipsilateral
secondary motor areas was associated with SABD-induced impairments in hand opening ability
due to the flexion synergy. The combination of this structural and functional evidence points to
increased compensatory reliance on ipsilateral secondary motor areas post moderate to severe
stroke, but with limited capacity to support proper hand function due to involuntary recruitment of
wrist/finger flexor muscles.

If individuals with stroke are indeed relying more on ipsilateral secondary motor areas as
compensation for contralateral CST and corticobulbar damage, we would expect to see systemic
changes in structural morphometry in these regions. This expectation is based on the known
relationship between functional activity and both synaptogenesis and dendritic growth commonly
seen in animal training models33,34. In line with these expectations, we saw increased GM density
within ipsilateral secondary motor areas, specifically in the premotor cortex, in individuals with
stroke compared to controls. Increases in GM density are proposed to indicate potential
synaptogenesis, dendritic growth, or gliogenesis within these regions34. The observed changes may
reflect a combination of a greater reliance on the non-paretic limb, associated with a high
prevalence of learned non-use5,35 and a compensatory increased reliance on the ipsilateral
projecting, cortico-bulbospinal tracts controlling the paretic limb in this population with more
severe impairments. Recent evidence of an increase in medial reticulospinal structural integrity at
the brainstem and cervical spinal cord at the ipsilateral side in individuals with hemiparetic stroke,
compared to age matched controls, also fits this idea6. Findings in rodent models have similarly
found increased dendritic growth and synapse proliferation in the ipsilateral cortex, particularly in

animals showing excessive disuse36,37. Additionally, the more severe impairments prevalent in
these individuals tends to lead to a reliance on compensatory strategies in everyday life, which has
also been hypothesized to lead to associated structural changes in the ipsilateral cortex38.

Having established that individuals with chronic stroke demonstrate long-term changes in structure
in i-SMA/PM, possibly indicating increased overall reliance on these regions, we then examined
the functional capacity of these regions to support hand function. To this point, the majority of
research on hand function post-stroke has focused on the role of CST damage and impairment
levels39,40. Although damage to CST and accompanying corticobulbar tracts explains the presence
of weakness post-stroke, it does not account for the loss of independent joint control such as the
flexion synergy often observed in individuals with more severe impairments. The flexion synergy
arises during arm lifting and reaching movements and leads to abnormal involuntary coactivation
with elbow/wrist and finger flexors20-23. We hypothesize that this occurs because residual resources
from remaining contralateral corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts become insufficient as the
demand of the shoulder abduction increases, and consequently individuals rely more on uncrossed
ipsilateral cortico-bulbospinal pathways, such as the corticoreticulospinal tract6, in compensation
to carry out the motor task41. Unfortunately, although these ipsilateral pathways allow control of
the shoulder, they reduce hand opening distally at the hand due to coactivation between shoulder
abductors and wrist/finger flexors23,26. Our findings here support this hypothesis, as individuals
with stroke demonstrated increased reliance on the ipsilateral hemisphere with the addition of an
SABD load, along with reduced hand opening ability, whereas healthy controls, who have intact
contralateral CST and corticofugal tracts, showed no effect of SABD.

We found that the observed shift to the ipsilateral hemisphere during the SABD task in the stroke
group was driven by increased activity in i-SMA/PM as measured by CAR. This was confirmed
when examining the overall absolute amplitude of cortical activity between the 2 conditions,
suggesting that as the demand of the task increased, individuals with stroke attempted to use
additional cortical resources from the ipsilateral secondary motor areas to execute the task.
Ipsilateral secondary motor areas have been widely implicated for their compensatory role poststroke, particularly in more impaired individuals. For instance, individuals post-stroke who used
their paretic arm less in daily life, as measured by accelerometers, also showed greater activity in
secondary motor areas during a grip task42. Similarly, increased secondary motor activity
correlated with greater jerk in a reach to grasp movement, highlighting its compensatory role and
inability to fully eliminate impairment43.

Importantly, SMA and PM serve as the primary origin for ipsilaterally-projecting corticobulbospinal tracts such as the corticoreticulospinal tract8,11. These tracts have been widely
implicated in the presence of the flexion synergy due to their low-resolution output that spans
multiple segments of the spinal cord and flexor bias in the ipsilateral arm15. Given that we see both
increased activity in these areas and a correlation with reduced hand opening ability due to the
flexion synergy during the SABD task, we argue this reflects increased recruitment of these
ipsilateral cortico-bulbospinal pathways. This argument is grounded in work done in monkeys
where lesions lead to an increase in strength of the corticoreticular projections7, and stimulation of
reticulospinal pathways elicits activation of shoulder abductor and arm/hand flexor muscles26. It
is unlikely that the increased activity in secondary motor areas during the SABD task in our study
reflects use of descending projections from ipsilateral CST since these primarily originate from

ipsilateral primary motor cortex, not SMA or PM, and these pathways do not sufficiently innervate
the distal portions of the arm7,44. It is also important to note that we do not see a correlation between
reduced activity in contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and reduced hand opening ability
during the SABD task, which corroborates the role of ipsilateral cortico-bulbospinal pathways
originating primarily from secondary motor areas as the main initiator of the flexion synergyrelated hand opening impairment.

The main difference observed here compared to monkey models of stroke is that dependence on

Unlike humans, monkeys maintain the ability to still functionally use the hand following a
pyramidal CST lesion, possibly due to a more viable rubrospinal tract innervating the hand.2,45. In
fact, recovery of reaching and hand function correlates with increased structural connectivity
within cortico-reticulospinal tract projections in monkeys19,46. However, the ability for these tracts
to allow dexterous hand control seems limited in humans based on the current results, as well as
recent findings showing that individuals with hemiparetic stroke show increased white matter
integrity in the ipsilateral medial reticular spinal pathway at the brainstem and cervical spinal cord,
which is correlated with their motor impairment severity6. This seems to contradict assertions that
ipsilateral secondary motor areas may support recovery of hand function post-stroke47,48, at least
in the case for hand opening. Instead, the current results fit better within the recently proposed
framework by Li and colleagues in which increased reliance on the ipsilateral SMA/PM corticoreticulospinal tract accounts for the movement impairments seen post-stroke49.

Interestingly, we also observed increased GM density within ipsilateral primary somatosensory
cortex in addition to premotor cortex. One possibility is that this reflects reorganization within the
sensory system to provide sensory information to motor outputs being generated by ipsilateral
cortico-bulbospinal pathways. Indeed, preliminary evidence has shown that sensory information
travels from the contralateral somatosensory cortex to the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex via the
corpus callosum post-stroke50. Additionally, sensory recovery post-stroke has been associated with
changes in both the contralateral and ipsilateral somatosensory cortex51,52. However, the majority
of research on neural plasticity post-stroke has focused on the motor component of recovery, and
thus it is difficult to prescribe the underlying neural mechanism driving this result.

Clinical Implications

Our results in individuals with moderate to severe chronic stroke demonstrate the insufficient
capacity, and actual further detriment, for ipsilateral secondary motor cortices to control hand
opening. This finding points to the need to reengage the lesioned hemisphere in order to improve
hand function. Although ipsilateral secondary motor areas allow sufficient control of the shoulder,
they do not sufficiently innervate extensor muscles of the hand and instead lead to involuntary
coactivation of flexor muscles. Therefore, they do not seem to offer a viable solution for basic
hand function. It has been argued that perhaps in the case of individuals with severe impairment,
increased reliance on ipsilateral-projecting corticobulbar pathways is the only option for staving
off complete paralysis due to unsalvageable damage to the contralateral-projecting pathways from
the lesioned hemisphere53. This is certainly possible, however, we have previously demonstrated
the ability for individuals even with severe motor impairments to reengage the lesioned hemisphere

and improve hand function following device-assisted training54. Considering it is also possible to
reduce the flexion synergy through progressive SABD training55,56, future work targeting both the
flexion synergy and finger/wrist extensor weakness may yield a solution towards improving both
hand and upper extremity function via a reengagement of ipsilesional resources.

Limitations

One of the main limitations of this study is the inability to directly measure activity within the
corticoreticulospinal tract. We are limited to the cortex when using EEG to look at cortical activity
related to the task, and thus cannot directly measure use of specific pathways. However, previous
work has indeed shown structural changes in this pathway post-stroke, especially in individuals
with more severe impairments6,57, supporting the notion of potential increased compensatory
reliance. EEG also allows us to look at cortical activity during tasks involving SABD, which would
be impractical inside an MRI scanner.

It is also worth noting that this experiment only looked at the effect of SABD on hand opening.
Findings may be different for hand closing compared to opening. Ipsilateral corticoreticulospinal
tract makes substantial innervations to the flexor muscles of the wrist and fingers, and thus may
enable sufficient hand closing control, at least for power grasps2,58. This could explain why
extensor weakness of the fingers is usually a more significant problem than flexor weakness posthemiparetic stroke22,59,60.
