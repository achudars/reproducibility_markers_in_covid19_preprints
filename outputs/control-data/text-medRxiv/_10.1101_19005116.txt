ABSTRACT
The occurrence of seizures in childhood is often associated with neurodevelopmental
impairments and school underachievement. Common genetic variants associated with
epilepsy have been identified and epigenetic mechanisms have also been suggested to play
a role. In this study we analysed the association of genome-wide blood DNA methylation with
the occurrence of seizures in ~800 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children, UK, at birth (cord blood), during childhood and adolescence (peripheral blood). We
also analysed the association between the lifetime occurrence of any seizures before age 13
with blood DNA methylation levels. We sought replication of the findings in the Generation R
Study and explored causality using Mendelian randomization, i.e. using genetic variants as
proxies. The results showed five CpG sites which were associated cross-sectionally with
seizures either in childhood or adolescence (1-5% absolute methylation difference at
pFDR<0.05), although the evidence of replication in an independent study was weak. One of
these sites was located in the BDNF gene, which is highly expressed in the brain, and showed
high correspondence with brain methylation levels. The Mendelian randomization analyses
suggested that seizures might be causal for changes in methylation rather than vice-versa. In
addition, seizure-associated methylation changes could affect other outcomes such as growth,
cognitive skills and educational attainment. In conclusion, we present a link between seizures
and DNA methylation which suggests that DNA methylation changes might mediate some of
the effects of seizures on growth and neurodevelopment.

INTRODUCTION
Seizures are episodes of abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain
that affect 1-14% of children under six years of age, with the highest incidence in
underdeveloped and rural areas 1, 2. The peak age for seizures to occur is at 18 months of age
and children that experienced seizures are at risk of developing epilepsy. Seizures and
epilepsy are associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum
disorders 3, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and cognitive impairment

4-7

. Moreover,

epilepsy with or without intellectual impairment is associated with low academic achievement
8

.

Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with epilepsy 9,
10

, some of which are located in candidate genes for epilepsy, for instance those coding for

ion-channel subunits, and are supported by other research in humans and other animals. As
it is likely that other factors may also underlie the disease, it has been suggested that
epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation are also involved in the onset of seizures
11

. In line with this hypothesis, genetic markers for epilepsy were found to be enriched in

histone modification markers, suggesting epigenetic regulation of gene transcription 9. The
association between seizures and DNA methylation has been investigated in studies involving
humans and other animals, although these studies relied on small sample sizes or on a
candidate gene approach. A recent study comparing blood DNA methylation in 30 adult
patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and 30 controls identified 216 differentially
methylated sites between the two groups, including sites on genes involved in ion binding and
metabolic activity 12. DNA methylation differences have also been observed in lymphoblastoid
cell lines derived from epileptic patients globally and in the BRD2 gene promoter

13

. Another

study that reanalysed these data discovered differential DNA methylation in non-coding RNAs
14

. Furthermore, alterations in DNA methylation were present in the hippocampus of epileptic

patients compared to controls 15. A study adopting a rat model of chronic epilepsy corroborated

these findings by revealing genome-wide differences in DNA methylation compared to control
rats 16.
Typically, in association studies it is difficult to assess the causality of any identified
association due to the potential for confounding and/or for reverse causation. Socioeconomic
status, for instance, is associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation 17 and with
increased risk for seizures/epilepsy

18

, suggesting that socioeconomic factors could be

confounding the association between DNA methylation and seizures. With respect to reverse
causation, case-control studies that examined DNA methylation after epilepsy had already
been diagnosed might have observed changes that were directly caused by the seizure
events. For instance, laboratory animal studies have shown altered gene expression after
induced seizures

19

. Mendelian randomization, a technique that uses the genetic information

associated with an exposure to estimate the causal effect of the exposure on an outcome, can
circumvent these limitations under certain assumptions 20.
In this study, we (1) investigated the genome-wide association of DNA methylation with the
occurrence of seizures from birth throughout childhood and adolescence in peripheral blood
samples from a prospective birth cohort; (2) carried out replication analyses in an independent
study sample; (3) explored the correspondence with brain tissue DNA methylation at the same
genomic locations to investigate whether these associations have neurodevelopmental
relevance; and (4) performed bi-directional Mendelian randomization to unravel causal links
between peripheral blood DNA methylation and seizures. Finally, we explored the potential
health consequences of a seizure-associated DNA methylation profile. For an overview on our
analysis plan, see Figure 1.

The discovery analyses were conducted in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children (ALSPAC), a large prospective cohort study that recruited 14,541 pregnant women,
resident in Avon, UK with expected delivery dates between the 1st of April 1991 and the 31st
of December 1992 21, 22. Of these initial pregnancies, there were 14,062 live births and 13,988
children who were alive at 1 year of age. The study website contains details of all the data that
are available through a fully searchable data dictionary
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).
Written informed consent has been obtained for all ALSPAC participants. Ethical approval
for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local
Research Ethics Committees.

Seizure Data
Questionnaire data were taken from ALSPAC questionnaires administered to the mothers at
four time points: 18 months, 8 years, 11 years and 13 years. The following questions were
asked at each of these ages:
18 months: ‘Has he/she ever had any form of convulsion/fit/seizure or other turn in which
consciousness was lost or any other part of the body made an abnormal movement?’,
8 years: ‘Has child had a convulsion/fit/seizure since 7th birthday?’,
11 years: ‘Has child had a convulsion/fit/seizure where consciousness or abnormal movement
was lost since 9th birthday?’, and
13 years: ‘Has she ever had a seizure, fit or a convulsion?’.
This allowed us to address proximal and distal (i.e. lifetime until age 13) associations between
DNA methylation and experience of seizures.

. Following DNA extraction, samples were bisulphite

converted using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation™ kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA, USA) and genomewide methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (HM450)
BeadChip. The arrays were scanned using an Illumina iScan, with initial quality review using
GenomeStudio. ARIES was pre-processed and normalised using the meffil R package

24

.

ARIES consists of from mother-child pairs measured at five time points (three time points for
children: birth, childhood and adolescence; and two for mothers: during pregnancy and at
middle age), although only children’s profiles were used in the current study. Low quality
profiles were removed from further processing, and the remaining 4593 profiles were
normalised using the Functional Normalization algorithm

25

with the top 10 control probe

principal components. Full details of the pre-processing and normalization of ARIES has been
described previously 24. Further pre-processing specific to the current study included removal
of probes not passing background detection (p>0.05) and probes on the X or Y chromosome.
To reduce the impact of outliers, we set methylation data points outside the 3 x inter-quartilerange to missing. The total number of probes available for analyses were N=468,828 at birth;
N= 471,092 at childhood and N=470,480 at adolescence.

Epigenome-wide association analyses
In ALSPAC, the final sample size at birth was N=822 (25 cases and 797 controls); at childhood
N=848 (7 cases and 841 controls) and N=813 (12 cases and 801 controls) at adolescence.
Only 2-3 cases overlapped across time points (Supplemental Material SM Figure 1). Fiftyeight out of a total of N=817 adolescents reported a lifetime experience of seizures.

We carried out four analyses. In analysis 1-3, we modelled methylation at birth (Model 1),
childhood (Model 2) and adolescence (Model 3) as the outcome and seizure status (measured
closest to each methylation time point) as the exposure. To investigate the temporal sensitivity
of associations, we ran a final analysis (Model 4), in which we modelled lifetime seizure status
(ever / never) at 13 years as the exposure and methylation at adolescence as the outcome
(Model 4). In all models (including birth), methylation was defined as the outcome regardless
of temporal order to keep model estimates consistent and comparable. These EWAS were
carried out in R version 3.3.1 using the CpGassoc package26.
All models were adjusted for age (when DNA methylation samples were taken), sex, prenatal
maternal smoking (Yes/No) and maternal education (university degree Yes/No), each derived
from ALSPAC maternal and childhood questionnaires. The model using cord blood data was
additionally adjusted for gestational age and birthweight. Unknown confounders and batch
were adjusted using surrogate variable analysis

27

. Additionally, we adjusted for cell counts

using the Houseman method for the childhood and adolescence timepoints28 and the Andrews
and Bakulski method for cord blood29.
To summarize, the following models were applied:
Model 1: Methylation (cord) ~ seizure status (18 months) + age + sex + birthweight +
gestational age + maternal prenatal smoking + maternal education + nucleated red blood cells
+ granulocytes + monocytes + natural killer cells + B cells + CD4(+)T cells + CD8(+)T cells +
SV1 + … + SV15
Model 2: Methylation (childhood) ~ seizure status (8 years) + age + sex + maternal prenatal
smoking + maternal education + granulocytes + monocytes + natural killer cells + B cells +
CD4(+)T cells + CD8(+)T cells + SV1 + … + SV13
Model 3: Methylation (adolescence) ~ seizure status (11 years) + age + sex + maternal
prenatal smoking + maternal education + granulocytes + monocytes + natural killer cells + B
cells + CD4(+)T cells + CD8(+)T cells + SV1 + … + SV14

cells + B cells + CD4(+)T cells + CD8(+)T cells + SV1 + … + SV14
To correct to multiple testing, we present both Bonferroni and FDR-corrected results.

Replication analyses
All CpG sites that were associated with seizures below at least an FDR-correction threshold
in ALSPAC were analysed in an independent cohort to assess replication. The Generation R
Study is a population-based prospective cohort study conducted in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, that recruited 9778 pregnant women with an expected delivery date between
April 2002 and January 2006. A total of 9749 children were born from these pregnancies and
extensive data and biological samples are available from the children and their mothers

30

.

DNA methylation was measured in peripheral blood of 469 children aged 6 years, using the
Infinium HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip as in ALSPAC. Preparation and
normalization of the BeadChip array was performed according to the CPACOR workflow in R
31

and methylation data points lower than the 25th percentile – 3 x IQR and higher than the

75th percentile + 3 x IQR were excluded. In Generation R, seizure events were measured
using the answer “yes” to the question "During the past 5/6 years, did your child ever have a
seizure/febrile convulsion?" asked to the mothers when the children were 6 years of age. The
final sample size was N=432, with 19 participants affected by seizures and 413 unaffected
(SM Table 1). Linear models similar to Model 2 were run in Generation R on EWAS FDRcorrected methylation sites and on BDNF probes. The covariates were measured and
categorised similarly to the analyses carried out in ALSPAC. The results in ALSPAC and
Generation R where also meta-analysed using METAL 32, using inverse variance weighting.

Mendelian randomization analyses

To assess the causal link between DNA methylation and the occurrence of seizures we
performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using the EWAS results for the CpG
sites with FDR-corrected p-values<0.05 in ALSPAC. Two-sample MR was performed using
the MR-Base online platform (http://www.mrbase.org/, last accessed 06-06-2018)

33

, the

MRInstruments R package (https://github.com/MRCIEU/MRInstruments, last accessed 06-062018) and the TwoSampleMR R package (https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR, last
accessed 06-06-2018).
Three MR analyses were performed. (1) To investigate the causal effect of DNA methylation
on the risk of epilepsy we performed two-sample MR with DNA methylation as exposure and
a diagnosis of epilepsy as outcome. For the genotype-exposure associations we searched for
methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), i.e. genetic variants that are associated in cis with
DNA methylation (i.e. within 1Mb either side from the CpG site), using the mQTL database
(http://www.mqtldb.org/, last accessed 06-06-2018)34, restricting the search to the time point,
at which the CpG site was associated with seizure status. For the genotype-epilepsy
association we used the summary statistics for ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for epilepsy or seizure
in MR-Base generated on UKBiobank data (last accessed 04-12-2018). (2) To analyse the
causal effect of risk for seizure/epilepsy on DNA methylation (i.e. reverse causation) we
performed two-sample MR with epilepsy diagnosis or febrile/vaccine-related seizures as
exposure and DNA methylation as outcome. For the genotype-exposure associations we used
the summary statistics for the genome-wide significant SNPs from a published GWAS metaanalysis on all epilepsies, focal epilepsy and genetic generalized epilepsy

10

and from a

published GWAS on febrile and MMR-vaccine-related seizures (focussing on 6 replicated
genome-wide significant
SNPs in Table1 of the original article)

. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals were

reverted to log-odds and standard errors to use in the two-sample MR analysis. +The summary
statistics for the genotype-outcome associations were drawn from the mQTL database

seizure-susceptible DNA methylation (exposure) on other health outcomes we first performed
a hypothesis-free PheWAS using the mQTLs for CpG sites associated with seizures and the
MR-Base online PheWAS tool to screen for potentially affected health outcomes. Then, we
performed two-sample MR with methylation as exposure and the health outcomes identified
by the PheWAS to estimate the magnitude of the effect. We also performed a hypothesisdriven two-sample MR on other neurodevelopmental outcomes previously found to associate
with seizures, i.e. autism, intelligence and education.

RESULTS
For a flowchart and overview of all results, see SM Figure 2.
Sample description
At 18 months, there were n=25 children with the experience of seizures since birth and n=797
without (Table 1). Groups were comparable with respect to sex, birthweight, gestational age
as well as maternal education and smoking behaviour during pregnancy. During childhood,
n=7 children had experienced seizures between 7 and 8 years of age while 841 had not. Age
at blood draw was slightly higher in the children with seizures (Table 1). Approaching
adolescence, seizures had been reported in n=12 children, while n=801 children had not
experienced seizures between 9 and 11 years of age. There were slightly more females in the
seizure group. Fifty-eight adolescents reported a lifetime experience of seizures, while n=759
had never experienced seizures. Groups were comparable with respect to maternal smoking
behaviour, maternal education and age at blood draw. For correlation plots on seizure rates
and all covariates included in the final models specific to each time point, see SM Figure 3.

Epigenome-wide association analyses
We did not identify any CpG sites that fell below a Bonferroni or FDR adjusted P-value
threshold at birth (Table 2 and SM Figure 4). In childhood, two CpG sites associated with

seizure status after FDR correction (cg10541930: beta = -0.010, SE = 0.002, uncorrected Pvalue = 4.32 x 10-8 and FDR = 0.020; cg25557432: beta = 0.014, SE = 0.003, uncorrected Pvalue = 1.82 x 10-7 and FDR = 0.043). The first CpG is located in an intergenic region, at the
transcription start site for a non-coding RNA, while the second lies upstream of the gene
MACROD2 involved in DNA repair.
In adolescence, we found one CpG site that fell below a Bonferroni-adjusted P-value < 0.05:
cg13974632 (beta = 0.053, SE = 0.010, uncorrected P-value = 5.55 x 10-8 and FDR = 0.026),
while another two CpG sites passed an FDR threshold only (cg15810326: beta = 0.014, SE =
0.003, uncorrected P-value = 1.19 x 10-7 and FDR = 0.028; cg16983916: beta = 0.056, SE =
0.011, uncorrected P-value = 1.79 x 10-7 and FDR = 0.028; Figure 2A). The first CpG site is
located in the first exon of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The experience of
seizures was associated with increased DNA methylation at this site (Figure 2B). The other
two CpG sites were located in the first exon of Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 10
(PRMT10) and in an intergenic region, respectively.
No CpG site could be identified to be associated with lifetime seizure experience. Inspection
of QQ plots and lambdas close to 1 gave little indication for an inflation of test statistics (SM
Figure 5).

Replication in the Generation R Study
For replication, we focused on five CpG sites: two that passed FDR correction in childhood
and three that passed FDR correction in adolescence. As one of the CpG sites in adolescence
was located in the gene BNDF, which is a key driver in neuronal growth and has been
repeatedly linked to epilepsy

36, 37

, we expanded our search space to include all CpG sites

annotated to BDNF (n=73).
None of the five CpG sites were associated with seizures in Generation R during childhood.
Although the direction of effect suggested some degree of concordance, all but one beta

coefficient were a factor of 10 smaller and P-values ranged between 0.1 and 0.8. (SM Table
2 and SM Figure 6A). When ALSPAC and Generation R results for these five probes where
meta-analysed together, all CpGs except for cg16983916 showed evidence of methylation
differences (p-value<0.05/77=0.0006, SM Table 2).
Investigating all 73 CpG sites annotated to BDNF, none replicated based on a correction for
73 tests. We observed only a weak correlation of all 73 regression betas between cohorts
(rho=0.046, p-value =0.70 based on adolescence results in ALSPAC and childhood results in
Generation R; SM Table 2 and SM Figure 6B). However, five CpG sites were significant at a
nominal level. Furthermore, considering that the whole BDNF region spans almost 68k base
pairs, we did note that one CpG site (cg25412831), which passed a nominal significance level
(although in opposite direction) in Generation R, was only 1,325 base pairs away from the
main BDNF-associated probe in ALSPAC (cg13974632). When ALSPAC and Generation R
results for these 73 probes where meta-analysed together, there was evidence for methylation
differences in 2 CpGs (p<0.05/77=0.0006, SM Table 2). These where cg13974632, the top hit
from the EWAS, and cg15313332, 20Kb upstream.

Cross-tissue concordance in DNA methylation
We queried three independent databases to investigate blood-brain concordance in DNA
methylation for all five CpG sites that passed FDR correction in ALSPAC. Based on data from
more than 122 pre-mortem blood samples and paired post-mortem brain tissue 38, cross-tissue
correlation was strongest for BDNFcg13974632 (r=0.39 between blood and brain tissue from the
entorhinal cortex, followed by tissue from the prefrontal cortex (r=0.27); SM Figure 7A-E.
Compared to BDNFcg13974632, the remaining four CpG sites showed correlations, which were
generally weaker for tissue from the prefrontal and entorhinal cortex. Cross-tissue correlations
based on a smaller sample of 16 individuals 39 reported different correlation profiles (SM Figure
7F-G).

Cross-tissue blood-brain correlations in a dataset of 12 epilepsy patients

with the larger dataset, although not discriminating between brain regions (BDNFcg13974632:

Based

on

data

available

via

the

Genotype-Tissue

Expression

(GTEx;

www.gtexportal.org) project, we investigated tissue-specific gene expression for genes linked
to the five FDR-corrected CpG sites. BDNF appeared to be expressed in brain and other
tissues with highest expression in the cerebellum, while very low expression was found in
blood. MACROD2 is predominately expressed in lymphocytes; PRMT10 is mainly expressed
in the ovaries (SM Figure 8).

Mendelian randomization analyses
Uni- and bi-directional two-sample MR was performed to investigate the effect of DNA
methylation on seizure occurrence and the effect of seizures on DNA methylation. We used
genetic associations with febrile and vaccine-related seizures and genetic associations with
epilepsy. The latter more generally includes the types of seizures observed in our study (e.g.
febrile and non-febrile)

41

. As full genome-wide summary statistics were only available for

epilepsy, but not for febrile and vaccine-related seizures, we could not perform the two-sample
MR to estimate the causal effects of methylation on seizures. We identified only one cis-mQTL,
which could be used as instrument for DNA methylation. In detail, the SNP rs10258194 was
associated in cis with cg16983916 (effect allele=T, beta=0.25, SD=0.04, p=2.33 x 10-10) after
excluding other SNPs due to linkage disequilibrium. For the other CpG sites, either transassociations (further than 1 Mb from the CpG site) or no associations were identified. Twosample MR indicated only weak evidence for causal effects of DNA methylation at cg1698369
(SM Table 3) on epilepsy.

For the reverse (i.e. epilepsy/seizure affecting DNA methylation), there were 9 SNPs to be
used as instruments for epilepsy from a previous GWAS meta-analysis on all epilepsies, focal
epilepsy and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), although only up to four SNPs were used
in any one analysis due to availability of summary statistics. Six SNPs were identified as
instruments for febrile/vaccine-related seizures, although only 5 were used. SM Table 4 shows
the results of the two-sample MR analysis performed using different methods to investigate
the causal effect of epilepsy on DNA methylation at the five CpG sites identified in the EWAS.
For cg13974632 (BDNF) there was some evidence for a positive association of GGE with
increased DNA methylation using the weighted median method (Figure 2 C-D). All methods,
including MR-Egger, suggested a positive effect of GGE on cg13974632, although these
analyses were based on only 3 genetic instruments and confidence intervals were large,
particularly for MR-Egger. The leave-one-out analysis indicated that this effect was not driven
by a particular genetic variant, providing little evidence for a violation of MR assumptions. This
association did not survive a correction for multiple testing and seemed to be specific for GGE
(i.e., the effect was not reproduced using focal epilepsy or “any epilepsy” as an exposure).
There was no evidence for associations with any other CpG sites.
The two-sample MR analysis of the effects of febrile and vaccine-related seizures on
methylation did not show enough evidence of a causal association (SM Table 5).
To test the effect of seizure-associated methylation on other health outcomes we first scanned
for potentially relevant health traits by performing a PheWAS (association of genotype with all
available outcomes) using the only mQTL available, rs10258194. As we used only one
instrument, we could not differentiate whether the associations were due to causal effects or
horizontal pleiotropy (i.e. the genetic variant has an effect on the health outcome outside of its
effect on DNA methylation at the specific CpG). The analysis revealed strong evidence
(Bonferroni-corrected p<0.05/776) for associations between rs10258194 and birth weight,
standing height and trunk fat-free mass (SM Table 6). The two-sample MR analysis (Table 3)
confirmed a positive, potentially causal, association of seizure-related DNA methylation at

cg16983916 with trunk fat-free mass and standing height. Since a causal effect of seizures on
birth weight is less plausible due to the temporal discordance of seizures occurring after birth,
we performed two-sample MR on adult weight instead of birth weight (although in the
screening PheWAS, adult weight was not associated with rs10258194 after multiple
comparison correction) and found weak evidence of a positive association. There was some
evidence of a positive association of methylation with fluid intelligence score and college or
university qualification based on data from UK Biobank. However, we could not replicate these
results based on data from other studies (Table 3). There was no strong evidence for an
association with autism.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed associations between blood DNA methylation and the occurrence
of seizures in a longitudinal pregnancy cohort study based in the UK. Effects were specific to
childhood and adolescence, with little evidence for a relationship at birth or for lifetime
exposure to seizures. During adolescence, one of the strongest findings was linked to the
BDNF gene. However, associations did not replicate in an independent study sample based
in the Netherlands. Follow-up analyses showed correspondence between blood and brain
DNA methylation levels in the BDNF gene and high expression across several brain regions.
Mendelian randomization analyses suggest a potential causal effect of seizures on DNA
methylation in the BDNF gene and potential negative consequences for growth and
neurodevelopment via DNA methylation in an intergenic region on chromosome 7. Although
the implications of the association with BDNF are interesting, the association was not
replicated. The results are summarized in SM Figure 2.
This study has a number of strengths. First, in both ALSPAC and Generation R cohorts the
information on seizures was provided by the parents near the time of occurrence, therefore
reducing measurement error and the possibility of recall bias. Secondly, repeated blood
sampling at different ages in ALSPAC, including birth, allowed age-specific cross-sectional

analyses. Thirdly, these studies have collected extensive information from obstetric records
and reported socio-economic factors allowing adjustment for potential confounders, including
birth weight as well as maternal smoking during pregnancy and maternal education. Finally,
we used a Mendelian randomization approach as an alternative method to control for
unmeasured confounding and examine the direction of observed associations. This provided
us with some evidence of a causal relationship between seizures and BDNF-linked DNA
methylation and pointed towards potential negative consequences of seizures on other health
outcomes.
Our results are partially in line with reports showing an involvement of neurotrophins, including
BDNF, in seizures and epilepsy. Studies conducted in animal models of epilepsy (reviewed in
42

) observed an upregulation of BDNF immediately after experimentally-induced seizures. A

study conducted on hippocampal tissue from 40 adult patients affected by mesial-temporal
lobe epilepsy showed increased or decreased BDNF expression, compared to healthy
individuals, depending on the region investigated and on the presence of psychiatric
comorbidities 43. Similarly, four isoforms of BDNF were found to be highly expressed in brain
hippocampal tissue from adult epileptic patients compared to healthy controls, although the
effect was not explained by changes in DNA methylation measured in the promoters of
isoforms IV and VI

37

. It is to be noted that the association reported in the current study was

located further upstream within the first intron of isoforms I, II and III, based on the latest gene
characterization

37, 44

.

Moreover, a recent family study investigating genome-wide DNA

methylation in peripheral blood, based on 15 trios of parents and their offspring, where the
child and one parent, but not the other, were affected by generalized genetic epilepsy, found
evidence of neurotrophins involvement, particularly BDNF, which was both hyper-and
hypomethylated

45

. In our study, we observed hypermethylation in the BDNF gene (in the

promoter or within introns, depending on the isoform), which would suggest decreased
expression. This is in apparent contrast with some of the previous studies, but in line with our
Mendelian randomization analysis that also showed some evidence of seizure-induced

hypermethylation in the BDNF gene when using generalized genetic epilepsy as the exposure.
The apparently contrasting findings might indicate rapid dynamic changes at the molecular
level and sub-tissue specificity that need follow-up investigation in biological systems with
better time resolution and multi-tissue characterization.
We also discovered associations with other methylation sites that have not been previously
observed, specifically in the MACROD2, the PRMT10 genes and two intergenic sites. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms within MACROD2 have previously been associated with autism,
although with rather weak evidence 46, and other brain-related traits such as intelligence and
mathematical abilities

47

. Individuals with de novo mutations in FBXO11, an analogous of

PRMT10, have been reported to show intellectual disability and autism 48. Although both genes
are predominantly expressed in non-neural tissues, these studies suggest that MACROD2
and PRMT10 could play a role in brain functioning and their methylation status could plausibly
be involved in seizures. However, the involvement of DNA methylation needs to be further
confirmed.
The results of this study have to be seen in light of the following limitations. First, despite this
being the largest epigenome-wide association study in childhood/adolescence, the sample
size was small considering the low prevalence of seizures in the general population. Second,
our initial findings did not replicate in data from an independent cohort. However, this could
also indicate that the associations are specific to the time window examined in the discovery
sample. For instance, the association with BDNF methylation was specific to the adolescence
time point, while in Generation R data was limited to childhood. Thirdly, we have relied on
DNA methylation measured in blood whereas seizures occur within the brain. Availability of
brain tissue for epidemiological research is very limited, and future studies could follow-up our
findings in animal models or post-mortem brain tissues. Finally, the Mendelian randomization
analyses relied on a small number of mQTLs (3 for epilepsy to BDNF methylation and 1 for
methylation to epilepsy and other health outcomes) and therefore did not allow for sensitivity
analyses aimed at ruling out bias due to horizontal pleiotropy.

In conclusion, we show evidence of a link between seizures and DNA methylation in childhood
and adolescence, potentially involving BDNF. Our study contributes to explaining the
relationship between seizures and other health outcomes and suggests that seizures may
lead to negative consequences on neurodevelopment and growth via DNA methylation.
