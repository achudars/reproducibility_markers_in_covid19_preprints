ABSTRACT

22

Cytologic features such as the shape and size of tumor cells can predict metastatic

23

death in uveal melanoma, but suffer from poor reproducibility. In this study, we

24

investigate the interobserver concordance of digital morphometry, and correlate the

25

results with established prognostic markers. The average number of cells analyzed in

26

each of 27 tumors, was 1957 (SD 349). Mean time consumption was less than 2.5

27

minutes per tumor. Identical morphometric classification was obtained for ≥ 85 % of

28

tumors in all twelve evaluated morphometric variables (κ 0.70–0.93). The mean

29

nucleus area, nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell area ratio

30

were significantly greater in tumors with low nuclear BRCA associated protein-1

31

expression (nBAP-1) and gene expression class 2. Patients had significantly shorter

32

metastasis-free survival if their tumors had low nBAP-1 expression (Log-Rank

33

p=0.002), gene expression class 2 (Log-Rank p=0.004) or tumor cell nuclei with long

34

max calipers (Log-Rank p=0.004) as defined in a training cohort and then tested in a

35

validation cohort. We conclude that digital morphometry can be fast and highly

36

reproducible, that for the first time, morphometry parameters can be objectively

37

quantitated in thousands of cells at a time, and that variables describing the shape and

38

size of the nuclei correlate to nBAP-1 expression, gene expression class and prognosis

39

in uveal melanoma.

1. Introduction

41

Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults

42

(Singh et al., 2014). Less than 5 % of patients have clinically detectable metastases at

43

the time of diagnosis (Singh et al., 2014). At a later stage however, up to 45 % of

44

patients will develop metastases even if the eye containing the tumor has been

45

removed (Kujala et al., 2003). Once macrometastases develop, there is no effective

46

treatment and median patient survival is only 4-12 months (Augsburger et al., 2009;

47

Carvajal et al., 2016).

48

Several methods for prognostication are in clinical use. Tumor thickness,

49

diameter, location in the eye and presence of distant metastases determine tumor stage

50

(Arnljots et al., 2018; Kivelä et al., 2017). Loss of chromosome 3 has a high positive

51

and negative predictive value for metastasis (Bornfeld et al., 1996). Commercial gene

52

tests based on the expression of 12 classifier genes have been developed and show

53

excellent prognostic utility in separation of class 1 tumors with low metastatic risk

54

from class 2 tumors with high metastatic risk (Onken et al., 2012). Furthermore, we

55

have previously shown the prognostic utility of manual (Szalai et al., 2018) and

56

digital image analysis-based (Stålhammar et al., 2019) determination of the level of

57

nBAP-1.

58

In 1931, Callender described six types of uveal melanoma based on cytologic

59

features such as cell shape and the size of the nucleus (Callender, 1931). The original

60

classification could accurately predict metastatic death, but suffered from substantial

61

intra- and interobserver discordance (Coleman et al., 1996; Gamel et al., 1992). After

62

several modifications, the morphological classification of uveal melanoma now rely

63

on assessments of the proportion of epitheloid tumor cells (McLean et al., 1983;

64

Seddon et al., 1987). Examination of cytological features still require a high level of

65

cytologic expertise and suffer from poor reproducibility (Gamel et al., 1992).

66

Computer-assisted methods have therefore been proposed as a way of facilitating

67

these assessments. In 1982, Gamel et al. found that 13 of 18 nuclear and nucleolar

68

features correlated significantly with patient mortality when evaluated with a digitizer

69

superimposed on microscopic images at a rate of 100 cells per hour (Gamel et al.,

70

1982). Since then, computers have improved manyfold in terms of their computing

71

power, cost and the number and scope of software applications and we can now

72

analyze a dozen of variables or more in thousands of cells per minute on inexpensive

73

off-the-shelf laptop computers (Stålhammar et al., 2016; Stålhammar et al., 2018).

74

Consequently, we see an opportunity to analyze cell morphometry features

75

with digital image analysis and compare these to other prognostic factors including

76

nBAP-1 expression in uveal melanoma patients from one American and one European

77

referral center.

2. Methods

80

2.1. Patients and Samples

81

The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Methods were carried

82

out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The protocol for

83

collection of specimens and data from St. Erik Eye Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden was

84

approved by the regional ethical review board in Stockholm, and the protocol for

85

collection of specimens and data from Emory Eye Center, Atlanta, GA, USA by the

86

Emory Institutional Review Board.

87

Patients were identified in the archives of the Oncology and Pathology

88

service, St. Erik Eye Hospital and L.F. Montgomery Ophthalmic Pathology

89

Laboratory, Emory Eye Center. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Enucleation performed

90

before December 2017, 2) Histologically proven uveal melanoma, 3) paraffin block

91

available, 4) gene expression classification available, 5) clinicopathological data

92

available, including tumor thickness, diameter, location, T-category and cell type, 6)

93

follow-up data available, 7) sufficient tissue for BAP-1 immunohistochemistry.

94

Exclusion criteria were: 1) Prior history of plaque brachytherapy, proton beam

95

irradiation and/or transpupillary thermotherapy, and 3) tumor fully necrotic or fully

96

hemorrhagic. 27 patients met the criteria. Our follow-up data was confirmed and

97

further extended in telephone interviews with patients or relatives. Informed consent

98

was obtained from all participants.

99

In order to establish optimized morphometry thresholds for the distinction of

100

metastatic versus non-metastatic disease we divided our 27 patients into one training

101

and one validation cohort. When determining the relative size of the training and

102

validation cohorts, we considered previous research indicating that the ratio should be

103

inversely proportional to the square root of the number of free adjustable parameters

104

(Guyon, 1997). As we only evaluated one morphometric variable at a time, we set the

105

ratio to 1:1. 13 patients were randomized to the training cohort and 14 to the

106

validation cohort.

107
108

2.2. Immunohistochemistry

109

The paraffin blocks were cut into 4 µm sections, pretreated in EDTA-buffer at pH 9.0

110

for 20 minutes and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies against BAP-1

111

(clone C-4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA) and a red chromogen,

112

and finally counterstained with haematoxylin and rinsed with deionized water. The

113

deparaffinization, pretreatment, primary staining, secondary staining and

114

counterstaining steps were run in a Bond III automated IHC/ISH stainer (Leica,

115

Wetzlar, Germany). Dilutions between 1:20 and 1:500 had been evaluated before

116

selecting 1:40.

117
118

2.3. Digital image analysis

119

After sectioning and staining, all glass slides were digitally scanned to the .ndpi file

120

format at ×400, using identical digital scanners at both institutions (Nano Zoomer 2.0

121

HT, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan). The digital image analysis

122

(DIA) software used was the QuPath Bioimage analysis v. 0.2.0 m4 (Bankhead et al.,

123

2017). The software was run on a standard off-the-shelf laptop computer (Apple Inc.

124

Cupertino, CA).

125

For assessment of the level of nBAP-1 expression, one positive cell (red

126

chromogen in nucleus) and one negative cell (haematoxylin but no red chromogen in

127

nucleus) was calibrated in each digitally scanned tissue section. All other parameters

128

were left at default in order to limit time consumption and maintain ease of use.

129

Tumors were then screened under low magnification (40×) and the area exhibiting the

130

most intense nBAP-1 staining selected for grading. Nuclear immunoreactivity was

131

evaluated at 200×, in a circular 0.5 mm-diameter region of interest (corresponding to

132

the field of view in a light microscope with a 400× objective) by automatic

133

classification (positive cell detection). Based on previous publications, the nBAP-1

134

expression was classified as “high” if immunoreactivity was detected in >30 % of

135

tumor cells within the region of interest, and “low” if it was detected in ≤ 30 % of

136

tumor cells (See et al., 2019; Stålhammar et al., 2019; Szalai et al., 2018).

137

A workflow for morphometric analysis was then created, including the

138

following steps for each tumor: A) Identification of all cells within the region of

139

interest, using the software’s cell detection function with the following setttings:

140

Background nucleus radius 8 µm, median filter radius 0 µm, sigma 1.5 µm, minimum

141

nucleus area 7.5 µm2, maximum nucleus area 200 µm2, threshold 0.1, max

142

background intensity 2 and cell expansion 5 µm. B) Measurement in each detected

143

cell in each region of interest of the following 12 cell morphometric variables: 1)

144

Nucleus area (µm2). 2) Nucleus perimeter (µm). 3) Nucleus circularity. 4) Nucleus

145

max caliper (µm). 5) Nucleus min caliper (µm). 6) Nucleus eccentricity. 7) Cell area

146

(µm2). 8) Cell perimeter (µm). 9) Cell circularity. 10) Cell max caliper. 11) Cell min

147

caliper. 12) Nucleus to cell area ratio (figure 1).

148

Tumor areas with intense inflammation, heavy pigmentation, bleeding,

149

necrosis or poor fixation were avoided. nBAP-1 classification and morphometric

150

analysis was performed blinded to all other patient data including outcome. For

151

measurement of interobserver concordance, two human observers performed the

152

digital morphometry (morphometric variable above or below median value) and

153

nBAP-1 classification (high or low) independently and blinded to patient outcomes.

154
155

2.4. Gene expression classification

156

Tumor tissue samples were obtained from freshly enucleated eyes by fine needle

157

aspiration. The contents of the needle hub were transferred into one of two RNAse-

158

free cryovials. Using the same needle, extraction buffer from the second cryovial was

159

aspirated and expelled into the first. This was then placed in a specimen bag,

160

immediately frozen to -80° C and shipped on dry ice for gene expression classification

161

based on 12 discriminating genes (HTR2B, ECM1, RAB31, CDH1, FXR1, LTA4H,

162

EIF1B, ID2, ROBO1, LMCD1, SATB1, and MTUS1) and 3 control genes (MRPS21,

163

RBM23, and SAP130) at a commercial laboratory (Castle Biosciences Inc.

164

Friendswood, TX, USA). Expression levels of the gene products are used to

165

categorize tumors as either class 1 with low metastatic risk, or class 2 with high

166

metastatic risk (Onken et al., 2012).

167
168

2.5. Statistical methods

169

Differences with a p<0.05 were considered significant, all p-values being two-sided.

170

The deviation of all clinicopathological variables from normal distribution was

171

statistically significant, when evaluated by the Shapiro–Wilk test (p<0.05). For

172

statistical tests of these variables, we therefore used the Mann-Whitney U test, which

173

does not assume normally distributed data. The deviation of all morphometric

174

variables from normal distribution was however not statistically significant (p>0.05),

175

why we used Students T-tests for these. For comparisons of categorical variables,

176

two-by-two tables and Fisher’s exact test were used. For correlation to Cox

177

Proportional Hazards for metastasis and Kaplan-Meier metastasis-free survival,

178

patients were split into two groups based on 1) the median value of each

179

morphometric variable, and 2) receiver operating characteristics (ROC) in the training

180

cohort, with equal emphasis on sensitivity and specificity for the development of

181

metastasis. The thresholds established in the training cohort were then tested in the

182

validation cohort. In evaluation of interobserver concordance, the percentage of

183

identically classified cases and Cohen’s kappa statistics (κ) were computed (Cohen,

184

1960). Metastasis-free follow-up was defined as the time in months from enucleation

185

to the last occasion patients without metastases was seen or in contact alive. All

186

statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics version 25 (Armonk,

187

NY, USA).

188
189

3. Results

190

3.1. Descriptive statistics

191

The mean age at enucleation of patients included in this study was 66 years (SD 15).

192

Of 27 patients, 15 were men and 12 women. 25 tumors originated in the choroid and 2

193

in the ciliary body. The cell type was mixed in 18 patients, spindle in 5 and epitheloid

194

in 4. Mean tumor thickness was 8.6 mm (SD 3.7) and mean diameter 15.8 mm (SD

195

4.8). 12 tumors were of gene expression class 2 and 15 of class 1a or 1b. 14 tumors

196

had low nBAP-1 expression and 13 high. Mean metastasis-free follow-up time was 47

197

months (SD 76, Table 1).

198

The average number of cells analyzed in each tumor was 1957 (SD 349),

199

which took an average of 74 seconds (SD 21) for nBAP-1 classification and 71

200

seconds (SD 17) for morphometric analysis, adding up to 145 seconds or nearly two-

201

and-a-half minutes per tumor.

202
203

3.2. Interobserver concordance

204

Identical nBAP-1 classification was obtained for 25 of 27 tumors (93 %), yielding a

205

Cohen’s kappa statistic indicating almost perfect agreement (κ=0.85).

Identical morphometric classification (morphometric variable above/below

206
207

median value) was obtained for ≥ 85 % of tumors in all 12 variables, yielding

208

substantial or almost perfect agreement (κ 0.70–0.93, Table 2).

209
210

3.3. Morphometry versus nBAP-1 expression and gene expression class

211

The mean nucleus area, nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell

212

area ratio were significantly greater in tumors with low nBAP-1 expression. Nucleus

213

circularity, nucleus min caliper, nucleus eccentricity and cell area, cell perimeter, cell

214

circularity, cell max and min caliper were however not significantly different (Table

215

3a).

216

Similarly, the mean nucleus area, nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and

217

nucleus to cell area ratio, but not the other morphometric variables, were significantly

218

greater in tumors of gene expression class 2 (Table 3b).

219
220

3.4. Adjusted thresholds

221

The 4 morphometric variables that correlated to nBAP-1 and gene expression class

222

were analyzed with ROC, with equal emphasis on sensitivity and specificity for the

223

development of metastasis. Mean nucleus area achieved an area under the curve

224

(AUC) of 0.67 (sensitivity 67 %, specificity 50 %, p=0.40) at threshold 27.5 µm2;

225

Mean nucleus perimeter achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 (sensitivity

226

67 %, specificity 70 %, p=0.24) at threshold 21.5 µm; Mean nucleus max caliper

227

achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (sensitivity 67 %, specificity 90 %,

228

p=0.13) at threshold 8 µm; and mean nucleus to cell area ratio achieved an area under

229

the curve (AUC) of 0.60 (sensitivity 67 %, specificity 50 %, p=0.61) at threshold 0.28

230

(figure 2).

231
232

3.5. Regression analysis and survival

233

In univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses of nucleus area, nucleus perimeter,

234

nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell area ratio, none was an individual predictor of

235

metastasis (Table 4).
In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients had significantly shorter metastasis-free

236
237

survival if their tumors had low nBAP-1 expression (Log-Rank p=0.002) or gene

238

expression class 2 (Log-Rank p=0.004), but not if they had a mean nucleus area,

239

nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell area ratio greater than the

240

median (Log-Rank p=0.20–0.83). When using the thresholds established in the

241

training cohort, mean nucleus max caliper > 8 µm was associated with metastasis-free

242

survival (Log-Rank p=0.05), whereas the other ROC-adjusted variables did not

243

separate groups with significant survival differences (Log-rank p=0.18–0.95, figure

244

3).

245
246

4. Discussion

247

In this study, we have shown that digital image analysis of uveal melanoma cell

248

morphometry can be fast and highly reproducible, and that variables describing the

249

shape and size of the nuclei correlate to nBAP-1 expression as well as gene

250

expression class. Patients with tumors that had large nuclei, as defined by their max

251

caliper, had significantly worse prognosis. On the other hand, no variable describing

252

the shape and size of the entire tumor cell correlated to the established prognostic

253

factors, indicating that for prognosis, the morphological characteristics of tumor

254

nuclei are more important.

255

The prognostic importance of cell morphology is by no means a novel

256

discovery. However, reproducibility, time consumption and level of expertise

257

required to make reliable assessments of morphometry have limited its utility.

258

Modern user-friendly digital image analysis techniques offer an attractive solution to

259

these problems, and for the first time we can now objectively quantitate morphometry

260

parameters in thousands of cells at a time.

261

In turn, changes to the size and shape of tumor cells are but a consequence of

262

changes in the genotype. As found by Onken et al. the helix-loop-helix inhibitor ID2

263

suppress the epithelial phenotype associated with an enlarged nucleus (Onken et al.,

264

2006). Loss of ID2 up-regulates the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin, which in

265

turn promotes the anchorage-independent cell growth required for metastasis.

266

Consequently, we regard the morphometric characteristics investigated here as

267

biomarkers of the state of the genotype.

268

Limitations of this study include a small sample size. Inclusion of a larger

269

number of patients may have revealed additional significant differences. This was

270

however prevented, primarily by the lack of tumors in our archives for which gene

271

expression classification was available. Far-reaching conclusions from our survival

272

analysis are thereby precluded. Substantial investments in digital scanning capacity is

273

required before the method presented here can be used. The time consumption

274

specified will most likely be longer for users without general experience in the

275

operation of home computers, and does not include preanalytical operations such as

276

digital scanning and loading and unloading of glass slides. Last, our sample is not

277

representative of all patients with uveal melanoma. We have only investigated the

278

feasibility of digital morphometry in enucleated specimens without previous plaque

279

brachytherapy. A large proportion of patients with uveal melanoma undergo primary

280

plaque brachytherapy or proton beam radiotherapy, and may never require

281

enucleation. It remains unclear if the digital morphometry characteristics of small

282

uveal melanomas is different from the relatively large tumors investigated here.

283

Accordingly, we encourage future studies to confirm these results in larger cohorts

284

that includes smaller tumors .

381

compares the perimeter of a shape to the area it contains, and is calculated by four

382

times π times the area divided by the perimeter squared. The circularity of a circle is

383

1.00, and less for less circular objects. B) A circular 0.5 mm-diameter region of

384

interest (corresponding to the field of view in a light microscope with a 400×

385

objective) was defined in each tumor. Within this region of interest, each cell was

386

analyzed for nBAP-1 expression and 12 morphometric variables describing the size

387

and shape of cells and nuclei. C) The morphometric variables have been automatically

388

identified within the region of interest shown in B. D and E) In another tumor, cells

389

have slightly larger, more rounded nuclei with prominent nucleoli, corresponding to

what would be known as epitheloid cells. Cell illustration by iStock.com/Vitalii
