ABSTRACT

Background: Hypovitaminosis-D has been linked to neuropsychiatric conditions, but

little is known about vitamin D status in individuals with chronic tic disorders (CTD).

This study sought to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with the

severity of tics and presence and severity of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder

(OCD) and/ or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Methods: This is a cross-sectional sub-study of the European Multicentre Tics in

Children Studies (EMTICS). Vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels (ng/ml) were obtained for 327

participants with CTD at study entry and tic severity was measured using the Yale

Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). An association between tic severity and presence and

severity of comorbid OCD and/or ADHD symptoms was analysed using multilevel

models controlling for season, site, sex, age and presence of comorbid OCD and/or

ADHD.

Results: The participants comprised 247 boys and 80 girls (4-16 years, mean [SD], 10.9

[2.72]). Hypovitaminosis-D ([25(OH)D] < 20ng/ml) was present in 33% of participants

with CTD and/ or comorbid OCD and/ or ADHD. The authors found no association

between 25(OH)D levels and tic severity or OCD symptom severity. However, lower

25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with increased severity of ADHD

symptoms in participants with CTD (β = -0.25, s.e. = 0.08, 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.09; p <

0.01).

Conclusion: Additional research is needed to confirm these findings and assess

whether hypovitaminosis-D may represent an underlying biological vulnerability for

comorbid ADHD symptoms in CTD as it may signpost novel strategies for prevention

and treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic tic disorders (CTD) are neurobehavioral disorders with an onset in childhood

or adolescence. Tourette Syndrome (TS), perhaps the most widely known CTD, is

characterised by the combination of multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic that

persist for more than a year

1 and

affects around 0.8% of children worldwide

2 3.

A large

proportion of individuals with CTD have associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities

such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity

disorder (ADHD)

3.

Genetic factors are important in determining susceptibility to TS, OCD and ADHD

as highlighted by a concordance rate for monozygotic twins with TS of 53%

50%

6 and

ADHD of 70-80%

7. However,

3-5,

OCD of

the fact that monozygotic twins often share an

environment and estimates of heritability are less than 100% in all these conditions

asserts quite strongly that environmental factors are also involved. Their identification

is, therefore, of great interest as they may be modifiable in contrast to genetic

susceptibility and signpost novel strategies for prevention and treatment.

One environmental factor of interest is vitamin D, a neurosteroid hormone with

pleiotropic effects, which plays an important role in skeletal health but also in neural

and immune functioning

8 9 10.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally

present in few foods and mainly produced in skin during exposure to sunlight (UVB

radiation). Its synthesis is therefore greatly influenced by season, latitude, air pollution,

skin pigmentation, sunscreen use and aging, as well as by genetic factors, altered

absorption/metabolism and medication

11 9.

Vitamin D influences a large number of

biological pathways, which may help explain association studies relating

hypovitaminosis-D with increased risk for many chronic diseases

11 8 9.

A number of studies have drawn a link between hypovitaminosis-D and

autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes mellitus), metabolic

disorders (e.g. atherosclerosis) and neoplastic disorders (e.g. colon cancer)

12 11.

Hypovitaminosis-D has more recently also been associated with several

neuropsychiatric diseases such as mood disorders, schizophrenia, autism, Parkinson’s

disease and Alzheimer’s disease

8 9 10.

To date, epidemiological evidence on the association between vitamin D and tic

disorders is limited. One study assessed vitamin D status in Chinese children (n = 179)

with tic disorder without psychiatric comorbidities and reported hypovitaminosis-D

and an inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and tic severity (r = -0.32)

13.

We,

therefore, wanted to test for such an association in our large population sample of

children and adolescents with CTD and comorbid OCD and/or ADHD, which was

collected as part of the European Multicentre Tics in Children Studies (EMTICS).

Our hypothesis is that hypovitaminosis-D is associated with the severity of

clinical features and psychiatric comorbidities in children and adolescents with CTD. To

our knowledge this is the first study investigating the relationship between vitamin D

(25(OH)D) status and the severity of CTD and presence and severity of comorbid OCD

and/or ADHD in a pan-European cohort

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants

The participants were part of EMTICS (n = 715), a prospective European longitudinal

observational study involving 16 centres located in nine countries across Europe and in

Israel

14.

Our cross-sectional study measured 25(OH)D levels at study entry of 327

children and adolescents (aged 4 to 16 years) with TS or another CTD according to

DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). The study cohort represented a selected sub-sample of the

EMTICS cohort based on availability of serum samples. The study was approved by the

Ethics Committees at all participating clinical centres and samples and data were

obtained with informed consent by the parents or legal guardians and written or oral

assent by the participating child before entering the study.

Clinical assessment

An established diagnosis of TS, chronic motor or chronic vocal tic disorder was

confirmed by study clinicians according to DSM-IV-TR criteria

15 using

semi-structured

interviews (Table 1b). Lifetime presence of OCD or ADHD was also assessed according

to DSM-IV-TR criteria

15.

Our main outcome measure for tic severity was the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale

(YGTSS), the gold standard to rate tic severity

16.

The YGTSS was assessed by study

clinicians and comprised the YGTSS Total (motor + vocal tic severity; range 0 – 50) and

YGTSS Global score (total + impairment score; range 0 – 100). Our primary outcome for

analysis was YGTSS Total score. In addition, the well-validated Clinical Global

Impression Scale Severity (CGI) was also used to assess tic severity during the previous

week

17.

The Children’s Yale Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) was used to rate

obsessive-compulsive symptom severity. The CY-BOCS total score (range 0-40) is

comprised two subscales: obsessions (range 0-20) and compulsions (range 0-20)

18.

The

parent-reported Swanson, Nolan and Pelham-version IV rating scale (SNAP-IV) assessed

ADHD symptom severity

19.

We used subscale severity scores to assess differences

between inattentive (range 0-27) and hyperactivity-impulsive symptom severity (range

0-27). We also used ADHD symptom count based on the DSM-IV-TR (range 0-18) and

assessed subscales for inattentive symptoms (range 0-9) and hyperactivity/ impulsivity

(range 0-9).

Analysis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)

Serum samples of 327 participants with CTD were collected by the clinical centres and

sent to the University Hospital Munich (LMU). The samples were stored at -80°C until

analysis. The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured in the ISO 15189

accredited lab on a DiaSorin Liaison analyser by chemiluminescent immunoassay

technology. Serum samples were processed according to the manufacturer's

instructions. The range of the assay was 4 ng/mL (10 nmol/L) up to 150 ng/mL

(375 nmol/L).

In our study, hypovitaminosis-D was reported at levels under 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) in

accordance with the US Endocrine Society

20.

optimal serum 25(OH)D level at ≥20 ng/ml (≥50 nmol/L)

21.

A serum 25(OH)D lower

than ≤10 ng/ml (≤25 nmol/L) is considered deficient, as it may be associated with

skeletal disease, and levels from 10-20 ng/ml (25-50 nmol/L) are considered

insufficient. In accordance with some experts levels of 25(OH)D >30 ng/ml (>75

nmol/L) are considered as optimal

20.

Statistical Analysis

We used multilevel models to investigate the association of 25(OH)D levels and tic

severity (YGTSS scores and CGI score) and severity of comorbid OCD (CY-BOCS scores)

and ADHD (SNAP-IV and DSM-IV-TR) symptoms. OCD and ADHD symptom severity

scores were taken from the entire cohort and not just those with a comorbid diagnosis.

For binary outcome variables, we used generalised linear mixed models to assess

whether 25(OH)D levels influenced the probability of an OCD or ADHD diagnosis. Since

this is a multicentre study, the data are hierarchically structured whereby participants

are clustered within site. We therefore used multilevel models with site as the cluster

variable in these analyses to control for any between site differences, which includes

latitude of centre.

To correct for seasonal variation in 25(OH)D levels, we used a previously described

method

22.

In short, it involves a sinusoidal regression model whereby the following

equation predicts 25(OH)D levels for any given day of the year (y = 25(OH)D level and t

st,

= day of year e.g. for January 1

௜

t = 1):

The difference between predicted 25(OH)D on a given day and the individual's actual

level gives a deseasonalised residual value of 25(OH)D controlling for season. We

included each participants’ serum 25(OH)D concentration adjusted for seasonal

variation, as well as the average adjusted serum 25(OH)D by site as predictors of tic

severity and comorbidity severity in order to disentangle the contextual effects from the

person-level effects

23 24.

Sex, age and the presence of a comorbidity (OCD and/ or

ADHD) were also entered as covariables.

To estimate the prevalence of hypovitaminosis-D throughout the year, we added the

predicted value of when 25(OH)D levels would be highest and at the mid-point in the

year to each participants’ residual 25(OH)D value from the sinusoidal regression model

for seasonal variation to estimate the distribution of 25(OH)D at these points in the

year. This gave an estimation of the proportion of participants who would present with

hypovitaminosis-D throughout the year, as well as for six months of the year.

RESULTS

Study cohort

The study included 247 males (75.5%) and 80 females (24.5%) aged between 4.54 and

16.99 (mean [SD], 10.90 ± 2.72) (Table 1, Figure 1A). The majority of participants were

of European white Caucasian ancestry (n = 301, 92%), whilst the remaining (n = 26,

8%) were mixed, Middle Eastern, North African, Asian or of unknown ancestry. Upon

enrolment into the study, most participants were diagnosed with TS (n = 298; 91.1%)

and a minority with a motor CTD (n = 28) or vocal CTD (n = 1).

Prevalence of comorbid disorders

The prevalence of comorbidities was high (n = 141, 43.3%) (Table 1, Figure 1B). The

most prominent comorbidity was OCD (n=95; 29.0%) followed by ADHD (n=79; 24.0%)

(Table 1) and, of these, 10.1% presented with both comorbid OCD and ADHD (Figure

1B).

Hypovitaminosis-D

Vitamin D status was assessed by measuring circulating serum levels of 25(OH)D, which

is a summation of cutaneous synthesis from solar exposure and dietary sources

25.

Levels of 25(OH)D fluctuated within the cohort according to season following the sine

curve used to correct for seasonality (Figure 2A). Highest levels were found during late

summer and lowest levels in early spring.

One third of the participants (33.0%) presented with hypovitaminosis-D (25(OH)D <20

ng/ml; <50 nmol/L) and 5.2% were vitamin D deficient (<10 ng/ml; <25 nmol/L)

(Figure 2B). The sinusoidal regression model used to adjust for seasonal variation was

used to predict each participants’ serum 25(OH)D on any day of the year based on their

residual value. This model predicted hypovitaminosis-D in 5.2% of the cohort year-

round and 28.1% for 6 months of the year (December–May).

No association between 25(OH)D levels and severity of tics

As shown in Table 2, using multilevel models, we found no significant association

between tic severity and 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.86). This was also true for the YGTSS

motor (p = 0.96) and vocal (p = 0.76). There was also no association between the

Clinical Global Impression Scale Severity (CGI) of tics and 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.83).

Association of 25(OH)D levels with comorbid ADHD but not OCD

OCD: As shown in Table 3, participants with lower 25(OH)D were less likely to have an

OCD diagnosis (log odds = 0.04, s.e. = 0.03, 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.07; p = 0.04), results from

the generalised linear mixed model predicts a 7% change in probability of an OCD

diagnosis if a participants’ 25(OH)D level changes by one standard deviation either side

of the mean for 25(OH)D (mean [SD] 25(OH)D, 25.21 ng/ml [8.59ng/ml]). However, we

did not find an association between 25(OH)D levels and OCD symptom severity across

the cohort, neither with the CY-BOCS total score (p = 0.34), nor the obsessions (p = 0.38)

or compulsions (p = 0.41) subscales (Table 2).

ADHD: Participants with lower 25(OH)D were more likely to have an ADHD diagnosis

(log odds = -0.06, s.e. = 0.02, 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02; p < 0.01). These results estimate a

9% increase in the probability of an ADHD diagnosis if 25(OH)D levels are one standard

deviation below the mean and a 7% decrease in probability for one standard deviation

above the mean (mean [SD] vitamin D, 25.21 ng/ml [8.59ng/ml]). There was also a

significant association between the parent-rated ADHD symptom severity based on the

SNAP-IV (β = -0.25, s.e. = 0.08, p < 0.01), as well as for ADHD total symptom count based

on the DSM-IV-TR and 25(OH)D levels (β = -0.10, s.e. = 0.03, p < 0.01) (Table 2) across

the cohort. The association existed for the ADHD inattentive symptoms dimension, both

for the SNAP-IV questionnaire (β = -0.17, s.e. = 0.05, p < 0.01) and the DSM-IV TR based

counts (β = -0.06, s.e. = 0.02, p < 0.01). For hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, the DSM-

IV-TR score was significant (β = -0.04, s.e. = 0.02, p = 0.02), whilst the SNAP score gave a

non-significant trend (β = -0.08, s.e. = 0.04, p = 0.09) (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

In this European cohort of children and adolescents with CTD we found

hypovitaminosis-D (<20 ng/ml; <50 nmol/L) in 33.0% and severe 25(OH)D deficiency

(<10 ng/ml; <25 nmol/L) in 5.2% of participants at the time of assessment. There was

no association between 25(OH)D status and severity of tics or severity of OCD

symptoms. However, a decrease in 25(OH)D, decreased the probability of an OCD

diagnosis. Conversely, a decrease in 25(OH)D increased the probability of an ADHD

diagnosis. In addition, lower 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with the

greater severity of ADHD symptoms in CTD patients. The inverse association was seen

on both clinician and parent-rated measures of comorbid ADHD symptoms. Of note, an

association was observed to a greater extent between serum 25(OH)D levels and

inattentive symptoms than with hyperactive ADHD symptoms.

Our study highlighted the risk of hypovitaminosis-D and vitamin D deficiency in

children and adolescents with CTD especially during winter months. Our multinational

population was recruited from across Europe and Israel from 16 centres in nine

countries. The analysis of vitamin D status included adequate adjustment for

confounding factors including seasonality and site (which includes latitude) differences.

In our study, 33.0% of participants presented with hypovitaminosis-D and 5.2% with

vitamin D deficiency (<10ng/ml; 25 nmol/L) requiring treatment according to the

National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines

26.

Hypovitaminosis-

D is common in Europe, however, prevalence rates vary significantly between age

groups and limited data is available on children and adolescents

27.

One limitation of

this study was that there was no control group so we could not compare rates of

hypovitaminosis-D in controls to participants with CTD. Nonetheless, raising awareness

of the risk of vitamin D deficiency in children and adolescents with CTD is warranted as

cost-effective prevention strategies exist such as altered diet, vitamin D supplements

and changes in behaviour related to sun exposure.

Our cross-sectional study did not find an association between 25(OH)D status and

tic severity in contrast to a recent study in Chinese children

13.

This may be due to

differences in ethnic background, genetic susceptibility and/or the type of tic disorder

given that, in contrast to our study, 69% of the participants had a diagnosis of

provisional tic disorder (hence, not chronic at the time of the study) and participants

with psychiatric comorbidities were excluded.

A decrease in 25(OH)D by one standard deviation below the mean decreased

the likelihood that a participant also had an OCD diagnosis by an estimate of 7%.

However, the severity of comorbid OCD symptoms in children and adolescents with

CTD was not linked to 25(OH)D status in our study. These incongruent findings do not

allow for us to draw any clear conclusions on the relationship between OCD and

25(OH)D in this patient group. Few studies on vitamin D in OCD have so far been

undertaken with inconclusive findings

28.

However, two studies reported that OCD in

patients with Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with

Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) or Paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric

syndrome (PANS) was associated with reduced vitamin D levels, which correlated with

both number of streptococcal infections before PANDAS diagnosis and with infection

recurrences

Notably, we found an association between hypovitaminosis-D and the presence

and severity of comorbid ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with CTD. As we

observed in our study, an estimate of



= -0.25 for SNAP-IV indicates that for an

increase of 25(OH)D by one standard deviation above the mean (mean [SD] vitamin D,

25.21 ng/ml [8.59 ng/ml]), the score on SNAP-IV ADHD scale (range 0-54) decreased,

on average, by 2.15. The physiological relevance of an increase in 8.59 ng/ml is not fully

understood; current guidelines on 25(OH)D are based on its role in bone metabolism

but less is known about the impact of changes in serum levels in relation to its

involvement in immune mechanisms, brain development and neurotransmission.

ADHD has previously been linked to hypovitaminosis-D and to higher prevalence

in regions with less sunshine

31.

A recent meta-analysis, which analysed 10,334 children

and adolescents, revealed that children with ADHD had lower levels of 25(OH)D than

healthy children

32.

In addition, a cross-sectional study reported that children with

ADHD not only had lower levels of 25(OH)D but also lower serum levels of vitamin D

receptor than controls

33.

In addition, we found that there was an association between 25(OH)D levels and

inattentive symptoms to a greater extent than hyperactive ADHD symptoms in our

cohort of children and adolescents with CTD. The findings were non-significant on

SNAP-IV severity scale for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and significant but with a

smaller effect size than inattentive symptoms on the DSM-IV-TR symptom count. These

findings are consistent with another recent cross-sectional study, which found no link

between 25(OH)D levels and hyperactivity in children with ADHD, but a significant

correlation between 25(OH)D levels and attention deficit as measured by the Conner’s

questionnaire in ADHD

34.

The neurobiological differences between ADHD subtypes are

not well understood, although there is some suggestion of distinct alterations in

underlying brain organization with greater hippocampal involvement in the inattentive

ADHD-phenotype

35.

One explanation for our findings could be that hypovitaminosis-D

influences certain networks e.g. regions involved in attention and less so motor

function, although more work is needed to validate this hypothesis.

The mechanism by which vitamin D status may be related to ADHD is

currently unknown and warrants further study. There is evidence demonstrating the

widespread presence of vitamin D receptors and 1a-hydroxylase (the enzyme

responsible for the formation of the bioactive form of vitamin D) in the human brain,

mainly in neuronal cells of the substantia nigra and hypothalamus but also

hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and cingulated gyrus

36.

Vitamin D is, therefore, thought

to play an important role in brain ontogeny and mature brain function due to its

neurotropic and neuroprotective effects and its impact on neurotransmission and

neuroplasticity

10 9.

There is an emerging literature indicating that vitamin D regulates

dopamine neuron development and function

37.

Supplementation with vitamin D3 was

recently reported to increase serum dopamine levels in children with ADHD

38.

Vitamin

D may directly up-regulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (a rate-limiting

enzyme in dopamine synthesis) by binding to the nuclear vitamin D receptor and

impact on the synthesis of serotonin in the brain

39.

However, vitamin D also plays an

important role in the regulation of inflammation, immunity, control of infection and the

composition of the gut microbiome

9.

These actions of vitamin D may also be of interest

in the context of ADHD as there is support for the role of inflammation and

autoimmunity in at least a subgroup of ADHD patients

to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (e.g. asthma, atopy), neonatal infections,

elevated serum interleukin levels (e.g. IL-6, IL-10), increased levels of anti-basal ganglia

antibodies, antibodies against dopamine transporter and genes of the major

histocompatibility complex

40 41.

Our cross-sectional study does not allow for drawing inferences about the

direction of effects or causality between hypovitaminosis-D and comorbid ADHD

symptoms in young people with CTD. Whether hypovitaminosis-D predisposes the

development and severity of comorbid ADHD symptoms or vice versa (“reverse

causation”) will need to be addressed. Prospective, longitudinal studies are therefore

needed, which should also include information on diet, sunlight exposure, medication

and screen for comorbid anxiety and depression. Vitamin D intervention studies may

help assess whether vitamin D supplementation can help prevent ADHD or improve

symptom severity in young individuals with CTD. There is evidence from recent

randomised controlled trials to suggest that oral vitamin D supplementation in children

with ADHD may improve ADHD symptoms

42.

In conclusion, our study is the first to investigate a relationship between

25(OH)D levels and severity of tics along with comorbid OCD and/or ADHD in young

individuals with CTD. Our findings showed that 25(OH)D levels do not impact on tic

severity or severity of OCD symptoms but are significantly associated with the presence

of ADHD and severity of ADHD symptoms. Further research is needed on the role of

hypovitaminosis-D on comorbid ADHD in this population as it may shed light on the

underlying pathophysiology of ADHD and highlight novel strategies for intervention and

prevention.

Figure 1: (A) Distribution of gender and age of young individuals with chronic tic

disorder (CTD). The graph shows the frequency of male (grey) and female (black) CTD

patients according to age. (B) Prevalence of comorbidities of young individuals with

chronic tic disorder (CTD). The graphs show the percentage of study participants with

CTD (56.6%) and comorbid obsessive compulsive-disorder (OCD; 19%) and/or

attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 14.1%) and comorbid OCD and ADHD

(10.1%).

Figure 2: Levels of vitamin D (25(OH)D) in young individuals with chronic tic

disorder (CTD). (A) Vitamin D serum measurements were plotted against 365 days of

year (i.e. Jan 1
