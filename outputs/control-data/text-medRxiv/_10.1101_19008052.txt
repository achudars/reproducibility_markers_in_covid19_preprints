Abstract

24

Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a main global public health problem. However, a systematic

25

review of TB resistance epidemiology in Africa is wanting.

26

Methods: A comprehensive systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect for English

27

research articles reporting on the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex

28

resistance in Africa from January 2007 to December 2018 was undertaken.

29

Results and conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative synthesis were respectively undertaken with 232

30

and 186 included articles, representing 32 countries. TB monoresistance rate was highest for isoniazid

31

(59%) and rifampicin (27%), particularly in Zimbabwe (100%), Swaziland (100%), and Sudan (67.9%)

32

whilst multidrug resistance (MDR) rate was substantial in Zimbabwe (100%), Sudan (34.6%), Ivory

33

Coast (24.5%) and Ethiopia (23.9%). Resistance-conferring mutations were commonly found in katG

34

(n=3694), rpoB (n=3591), rrs (n=1272), inhA (n=1065), pncA (n=1063) and embB (n=705) in almost all

35

included countries: S315G/I/N/R/T, V473D/F/G/I, Q471H/Q/R/Y, S303C/L etc. in katG; S531A/F/S/G,

36

H526A/C/D/G, D516A/E/G etc. in rpoB; A1401G, A513C etc. in rrs; C15T, G17A/T, -A16G etc. in

37

inhA; Ins456C, Ins 172G, L172P , C14R, Ins515G etc in pncA. Commonest lineages and families such as

38

T (n=8139), LAM (n=5243), Beijing (n=5471), Cameroon (n=3315), CAS (n=2021), H (n=1773) etc.,

39

with the exception of T, were not fairly distributed; Beijing, Cameroon and CAS were prevalent in South

40

Africa (n=4964), Ghana (n=2306), and Ethiopia/Tanzania (n=799/635) respectively. Resistance mutations

41

were not lineage-specific and sputum (96.2%) were mainly used for diagnosing TB resistance using the

42

LPA (38.5%), GeneXpert (17.2%), whole-genome sequencing (12.3%) and PCR/amplicon sequencing

43

(9%/23%). Intercountry spread of strains were limited while intra-country dissemination was common.

44

TB resistance and its diagnosis remain a major threat in Africa, necessitating urgent action to contain this

45

global menace.

1. Introduction

48

As one of the oldest diseases of mankind, it is still surprising and disturbing that Tuberculosis (TB)

49

continues to remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from a single aetiological agent

50

worldwide (1-3), with an estimated 10.4 million active TB cases and nearly 1.6 million deaths in 2018

51

(4). Disturbingly, poorer and overpopulated regions with overburdened healthcare systems such as Africa

52

and South-East Asia comprised 82% of TB deaths among HIV-negative people (5), showing that high TB

53

incidence cases occurred in low-income and resource-limited countries (6-8). Particularly in Africa where

54

the TB incidence rate is around 25% (5), the situation is worsened by social conditions, the HIV

55

epidemic, weak healthcare systems, scarce laboratories, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant-TB

56

(MDR-TB) (7, 9, 10).

57

Effective TB prevention and control, diagnosis and treatment, particularly of drug-resistant (DR)-TB,

58

needs a large proportion of national budgets [15]. Moreover, DR-TB also affects economic activity as

59

most TB patients are economically active adults with dependents [14]. Dheda et al. (2014) revealed that

60

in certain African countries such as South Africa, where DR-TB accounts for less than 3% of all TB

61

cases, over a third of the national TB budget is sapped up by DR-TB alone, which is unmaintainable and

62

threatens to weaken nationwide TB programmes [14, 15]. Similarly, a cost analysis study in South Africa

63

by Pooran et al. (2013) revealed that smear-positive drug sensitive-TB (DS-TB) costed $191.66 per case,

64

whereas a smear-negative and retreatment cases costed $252.54 and $455.50, respectively, making the

65

latter two more expensive [15].

66

The TB menace in Africa is compounded by the burgeoning prevalence of DR-TB (11), MDR-TB and

67

extensively drug-resistant (XDR-) TB (12), which are impossible to treat with first line drugs and result in

68

higher mortalities, increased medication costs and drug-associated toxicities (13-15). Delays in diagnosis

69

and treatment of TB, previous exposure to anti-TB drugs (2, 11, 16, 17), inappropriate drug regimens (18-

70

20), poor adherence to prescribed regimen (19), and primary infections with DR-TB strains are the main

71

contributing risk factors for the emergence and dissemination of DR-TB (21, 22). The emergence of DR-

72

TB has necessitated the development of rapid and simple diagnostic methods to detect drug resistance and

73

evolving resistance mechanisms in the M. tuberculosis (M. tb) genome (2, 12). Evidently, early and

74

accurate detection of DR-TB enhances appropriate treatment and informs tailored interventions to break

75

the TB transmission chain (2). However, the dearth of advanced molecular diagnostic tools, well-

76

equipped laboratory infrastructure and trained personnel in most resource-limited countries in Africa,

77

limits the detection of DR-TB to the use of non-molecular techniques that are time-consuming and have

78

limited efficiency (23, 24).

79

Thus, DR-TB is perceived after persistent and/or exacerbating TB symptoms several weeks or months

80

after treatment with first-line antibiotics in such settings, consequently selecting and proliferating MDR

81

and XDR-TB (20, 25). Abdelaal et al. (2009) revealed that DR-TB was high (70%) in previously treated

82

patients than in newly infected patients (30%) (2) whilst Affolabi et al. (2017) confirmed that patients

83

with a history of TB chemotherapy are more likely to develop MDR-TB strains than newly treated

84

patients (16). These findings buttress the need for efficient, simpler and cheaper TB and DR-TB

85

diagnostics for a comprehensive containment of the TB menace.

86

The number of antibiotics to which M. tb is resistant to is also used to classify the level of resistance as

87

mono resistance, MDR, and XDR. M. tuberculosis that are resistant to only one of the first-line drugs

88

such as isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA) are described as

89

mono-resistant whilst those that are resistant to at least both INH and RIF are defined as MDR. MDR-TB

90

with additional resistance to a fluoroquinolone (FQ) and at least one of the three injectable second-line

91

anti-TB drugs such as amikacin (AMK), kanamycin (KAN) and capreomycin (CAP) is classified as

92

XDR-TB (5, 11, 20, 26, 27).

93

Drug resistance in M. tb is mediated through various mechanisms. Firstly, the hydrophobic mycolic acid-

94

saturated architecture of the M. tb cell wall reduces permeability to several antibiotics (20, 27-29).

95

Secondly, mutations in the hotspot regions of genes encoding drug target proteins or enzymes result in

96

drug resistance (27, 30). Finally, active efflux of antibiotics and expression of drug-deactivating enzymes

97

protect the bacilli against antibiotics (27, 28). In this review, the epidemiology of resistance-conferring

98

mutations i.e., deletions, insertions, frameshift or point mutations, described in genes mediating resistance

99

to first-line antitubercular drugs viz., INH, RIF, PZA, EMB, and streptomycin (STM) (18, 31-37), as well

100

as for most second-line antitubercular drugs such as ethionamide (ETM), FQ, CAP, KAN, and AMK (36-

101

38) are described. Unlike in Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative bacterial species, horizontal acquisition of

102

resistance genes are unknown in TB (20, 39). However, Mehra et al. (2016), recently reported on the

103

presence of drug resistance ABC (efflux) transporters and important virulence factors/genes such as the

104

ESX-1 transport machinery, including ESAT-6 and CFP-10, as well as ESX-5 regions of the type-VII

105

secretion system (T7SS) on a genomic island in M. tuberculosis genomes, suggesting horizontal gene

106

transmission.

107

Molecular epidemiology analysis decodes strain transmission dynamics, risk factors for recent

108

transmission, the occurrence of mixed M. tb infections (40), disease severity and drug resistance (41), as

109

well as TB strains related to outbreaks (42). There are currently seven M. tb lineages, comprised of

110

several sub-lineages and families, with region-specific prevalence rates and varying virulence capacities

111

(43). Specifically, the Beijing family has been implicated in several studies as having a better capability

112

for developing MDR (40, 44, 45). Genotyping tools such as spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR typing, IS6110

113

RFLP, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) are normally used to determine the lineage and

114

transmission routes of M. tb in Africa, albeit WGS provides a better typing and evolutionary

115

epidemiology resolution.

116

Evidence before this review

117

Many studies have reviewed the resistance rate of antitubercular drugs, mechanisms of resistance, and

118

distributions of M. tuberculosis strains/lineages in distinct African countries, but not throughout Africa. A

119

thorough search of the literature in Pubmed within the last five years for reviews addressing the molecular

120

epidemiology, resistance rates and diagnostics throughout Africa yielded no results, suggesting that this

121

could be the first to review these on the continent.

Purpose of this review

123

This review seeks to describe the molecular epidemiology of M. tb strains/genotypes per country, their

124

mechanisms of resistance, and mono-resistance, MDR and XDR rates in Africa. Furthermore, we describe

125

herein the molecular diagnostic methods used to identify and characterize antitubercular drug resistance

126

as well as the genotyping methods used to identify M. tb lineages/sub-lineages in Africa. It is our aim

127

that these findings shall inform evidence-based public health TB intervention policies as well as the

128

prescription, stewardship and design/development of novel antitubercular medications.

129

2. Methods

130

Databases and Search Strategy

131

A comprehensive literature search was carried out on PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect

132

electronic databases. English research articles published between January 2007 and December 2018 were

133

retrieved and screened using the following search terms and/or phrases: "molecular epidemiology";

134

“Mycobacterium tuberculosis"; "tuberculosis"; "mechanisms of drug resistance"; "genetic diversity";

135

"transmission dynamics"; "genotyping"; drug resistance"; "MDR-TB"; "XDR-TB"; "gene mutations";

136

"first- and second-line anti-TB drug"; "frequency of gene mutation"; and "Africa". These search

137

words/phrases were further paired with each other or combined with names of each African country, and

138

search strings were implemented using "AND" and "OR" Boolean operators. The search focused on the

139

molecular epidemiology of M. tb and/or mechanisms of antitubercular drug resistance.

140

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

141

Articles not reporting on M. tb genotypes and anti-TB drug resistance mechanisms were excluded. Studies

142

addressing the following were included: [a] molecular epidemiology/genotype of M. tb strains; [b]

143

resistance-conferring mutations associated with first and second-line antitubercular drugs; [c] molecular

144

diagnostics; [d] TB research conducted in Africa; [e] studies conducted between January 2007 and

145

December 2018; and [f] studies published in English.

146

This review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-

147

Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Figure 1). The following data were extracted from the included articles:

148

country; year of study; specimen source(s); genotyping and diagnostic method(s)/techniques used; M. tb

149

strains/lineages/sub-lineages; sample size; resistant isolates and resistance rates; frequency of resistance-

150

conferring mutations per gene; antitubercular drug resistance mechanisms (Tables S1-S6).

151

The rate of resistance to anti-TB drugs was evaluated per country to identify regions with the lowest and

152

highest burden of mono-resistance, MDR and XDR rates. Resistance mutations distribution per gene were

153

examined to identify countries with the most resistance as well as the mutation rate per locus of each

154

gene. The distribution of M. tb lineages/sub-lineages and families were determined per country. The

155

association of M. tb lineages with specific gene mutations were assessed.

156

Phylogenomics

157

Genomes of M. tb isolated from Africa from 1997 to 2019 (n=800 isolates) were downloaded from

158

PATRIC (https://www.patricbrc.org/) and categorized into resistant isolates and mixed (both resistant and

159

non-resistant) isolates (Supplementary dataset). RAxML v8.2 was used to draw the core-genome

160

phylogenetic trees of these strains, using Streptococcus mitis M3-4 as an outgroup/reference strain (46).

161

The trees were subsequently annotated with Figtree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Isolates of

162

the same country were given the same label colours. Clades and subclades were highlighted with the same

163

colours to show their closer relationship.

164

Statistical analysis

165

Microsoft Excel® 365 were used to analyze the resistance rate and frequency data in this study using the

166

raw data extracted from the included articles. The resistance rates per antibiotic per country were

167

calculated by dividing the total resistant isolates by the total isolates for which antibiotic sensitivity was

168

determined.

3. Results

170

Characteristics of included studies

171

As described in Figure 1, 1688 potential research articles were documented: 1598 articles from PubMed,

172

41 articles from Web of Science, 37 articles from ScienceDirect, and 12 articles from other sources

173

obtained through manual search. Of the total, 589 were non-duplicated and subjected to further

174

evaluation, 253 were excluded based on the title and abstract evaluation whilst 336 were retained on

175

detailed full-text review. After full-text evaluation, 232 studies on the molecular epidemiology and/or

176

mechanisms of antitubercular drug resistance were used for qualitative review analysis, and 186 studies

177

were used for quantitative analysis (Tables S1-S6).

178

The 186 studies were from 32 out of 54 (59.3%) countries in Africa, and these included Algeria (n=1

179

study, 126 isolates), Angola (n=1 study, 89 isolates), Benin (n=2 studies, 294 isolates), Burkina Faso (n=2

180

studies, 183 isolates), Botswana (n=1 study, 260 isolates), Cameroon (n=4 studies, 1334 isolates), Chad

181

(n=1 study, 311 isolates), Congo (n=2 studies, 120 isolates), Ivory Coast (n=3 studies, 261 isolates),

182

Djibouti (n=3 study, 529 isolates), Egypt (n=5 studies, 697 isolates), Ethiopia (n=36 studies, 7 338

183

isolates), Gabon (n=1 study, 124 isolates), Ghana (n=7 studies, 7 527 isolates), Guinea (n=1 study, 184

184

isolates), Guinea-Bissau (n=2 studies, 514 isolates), Madagascar (n=1 study, 158 isolates), Malawi (n=3

185

studies, 2054 isolates), Mali (n=2 studies, 571 isolates), Morocco (n=7 studies, 1966 isolates),

186

Mozambique (n=6 studies, 884 isolates), Nigeria (n=8 studies, 1984 isolates), Rwanda (n=2 studies, 221

187

isolates), Sierra Leone (n=2 studies, 194 isolates), South Africa (n=46 studies, 18 635 isolates), Swaziland

188

(n=2 studies, 203 isolates), Sudan (n=5 studies, 469 isolates), Tanzania (n=9 studies, 1 756 isolates),

189

Tunisia (n=4 studies, 1 701 isolates), Uganda (n=13 studies, 3 873 isolates), Zambia (n=2 studies, 395

190

isolates) and Zimbabwe (n=2 studies, 338 isolates) (Table S1).

191

There were ~55, 924 M. tb isolates from the 232 studies that were isolated from different specimen

192

sources, including sputum specimens (85.5%, n=51419 isolates), fine needle aspirates (FNA) (4.8%,

193

n=1095 isolates), fine needle aspirates and sputum (3.8%, n=2779 isolates), and gastric lavage and

194

sputum (2.2%, n=232 isolates) (Table 1). The molecular epidemiology of M. tb strains/lineages in Africa

195

were found in 126 studies whilst 95 studies reported on only mechanisms of resistance (gene mutations)

196

associated with first and second-line anti-TB drugs (Table S2-S4). As well, 28 studies reported on M. tb

197

strains/lineages associated with specific mutations conferring resistance to first and second-line anti-TB

198

drugs in Africa (Table S6). Fifty-three studies reported on the target gene or whole-genome sequencing

199

analysis after performing phenotypic drug susceptibility testing with the conventional proportion (agar

200

dilution) methods on Lowenstein-Jensen agar medium and BACTEC MGIT 960 and 460 systems (Tables

201

2 & S5). The least sample size per study were observed in Ivory Coast (n=2), South Africa (n=2) and

202

Uganda (n=2); the largest sample sizes were observed in South Africa (n=4667). A molecular

203

characterization of M. tb strains and/or mechanisms of drug resistance (gene mutations) associated with

204

drug resistance were performed for all included studies (Table S1-S6 ).

205

Rate of drug resistance and isolates source(s)

206

From the ~55 924 total isolates, drug sensitivity tests (DST) were done for 24 836 isolates, of which 23

207

959 isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, resulting in an overall resistance rate of 96.5% (Table

208

S5). The mono-resistance (to at least one antibiotic) and MDR rate per country is shown in Figure 2 and

209

Tables S3 and S5. Mono-resistance and MDR to any of the anti-TB drugs was found in only 25 countries

210

out of 32 countries included in this review, with INH and RIF having the highest monoresistance rates

211

(Fig. 2A-2C). MDR rate was highest in Zimbabwe (100%), Swaziland (100%) and Guinea Bissau (88.9),

212

albeit South Africa had the highest number (n=4579) of MDR isolates. MDR rates were relatively low in

213

other countries (Fig. 2D). The rate of patients with MDR and XDR-TB strains in Africa were 14.5% (3

214

598 MDR isolates), and 3.1% (781 XDR isolates), respectively. However, all the XDR isolates were from

215

South Africa.

216
217

In almost all the 25 countries, resistance mutations were found in mainly the katG (29%), rpoB (28%), rrs

218

(10%) and inhA (8%) genes, with pncA (8%) mutations being commonly found in Zambia, Uganda,

219

Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Gabon. embB (6%) was common in Uganda, Tanzania, Sierra Leone,

220

Nigeria, Mozambique, Morocco and Egypt. Resistance mutations in gyrA (6%) were also common in few

221

countries such as Tunisia, Rwanda, Nigeria, Mozambique, Morocco, and Congo (Fig. 2E and 2F).

222
223

Within each of these resistance genes, there were common mutations that were found in isolates from all

224

countries (Figures 3-5; Tables S2-S4; FIG. 4). For instance, in rpoB, S531A/F/L/S/Q/T/W/Y/STOP,

225

H526A/C/D/G/L/N/P/Q/R/T/Y/del, and D516A/E/G/V/Y/del were common, S315G/I/N/R/T/L/S/+ahpC-

226

48 and V473D/F/G/I/K/M/N/R/S/V/ W/Y/STOP were the commonest in katG,, C15T, G17A/T and

227

T8A/C were prevalent in inhA and its promoter (inhAPro) whilst M306I/LV/Xaa was more pronounced in

228

embB. Mutations in the pncA gene were varied and spread-out on the gene, with Ins456C, L172P/G/Ins,

229

K96R/STOP and C14R being dominant. K43R and K88R/T on rpsL, D94A/G/H/N/Y, A90L/V, D94G

230

and S95T on gyrA as well as A1401G, A513C, S2169A etc. on rrs were the most recurring mutations

231

(Fig. 3). These mutations, particularly in rpoB, katG and inhA, were found in isolates from almost all the

232

countries, with pncA mutations being reported mainly from Gabon, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa,

233

Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia (Fig. 4-5). Reported mutations on the rpoA/C, embA/C, gyrB, gidB, eis,

234

ndh, ahpC, tlyA were relatively few and reported in few countries throughout Africa. For instance, gibB

235

was reported in Cameroon, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Uganda, eis was reported in Ivory

236

Coast and South Africa, ndh was found in Ghana, ahpC was found in Ghana and Uganda, and tlyA was

237

found in South Africa (Figure 3-5; Tables S2-S4; FIG. 4).

238

Commonest mutations in each resistance gene per lineage, sub-lineage and families are shown in Figure 6

239

and Table S6. Lineage or family-specific resistance mutations per gene were difficult to find, particularly

240

for mutations that occurred in smaller frequencies. Particularly, rpoB (e.g. S531L, D516Y, H526Y) and

241

katG (S315T) mutations were found in almost all lineages and families in almost all countries, albeit in

242

very low prevalence in Beijing strains, which were predominantly reported from South Africa; katG

244

were very pre-dominant in Beijing, F15/LAM4/KZN and X lineages. G204D and G102A mutations in

245

inhA were commonly associated with the Ghana-type sublineage, which was reported mainly from Ghana

246

whilst the C15T mutation was spread throughout almost all countries and lineages (Figure 5; Table S6).

247

Notably, only T47A mutation (n=2) in pncA was reported in Beijing strains whilst low frequencies of

248

other diverse pncA mutations were found in several other families, particularly in South Africa; the sole

249

mutation reported in M. bovis was a single pncA mutation (H57D). Likewise, embB mutations were

250

almost absent in Beijing and CAS strains, but was very common in R86, Cameroon, and KZN strains

251

whilst very low frequencies were found in almost all other families (Fig. 5).

252
253

Mutations in genes conferring resistance to 2nd-line drugs were not as frequent as those in 1st-line drugs.

254

Specifically, gyrA mutations were very low in Beijing, EuA-T2, and Cameroon strains, high in EuA-

255

LAM9-T5, F28, F15/LAM4/KZN etc. and absent in M. africanum, M. bovis, Ghana-type, Haarlem, CAS,

256

Congo, KZN, LCC, SIT954, X, Sierra Leone, Uganda, TURK and S-type strains. Furthermore, gibB

257

mutations were prevalent in LAM, including EuA-LAM, and M. africanum II strains, but were very low

258

in Cameroon-type, East African Indian (EAI), X-type, Sierra Leone, and uncharacterized strains.

259

Resistance mutations occurred in gibB alongside rpsL and/or rrs in Cameroon, EAI, LAM (EuA-LAM),

260

X, M. africanum, Sierra Leone, and uncharacterized strains (Figure 5; Table S6).

261

North Africa: Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia

262

Egypt

263

DST was determined for 316 clinical isolates by three studies in Egypt, resulting in a resistance rate of

264

40.5% (n=128) and a RIF-monoresistance rate of 3.2% (n=10) (Tables S1 & S3), the highest of which

265

was reported by Abdelaal et al.(2009) to be 3.9% (n=6) (2). In the same year, Abbadi et al.(2009)

266

reported a 1.9% (n=3) RIF mono-resistance rate (47). RIF resistance was mostly mediated by S531L

267

(n=21), D516V (n=8), and H526N/Y (n=8) mutations in the rpoB gene (48, 49). Similarly, the mean INH-

268

monoresistance rate in Egypt was found to be 5.4% (n=17), mediated by S315T (n=31) mutation in katG

269

(Table S2).

270

Abbadi et al (2009) reported a PZA-monoresistance rate of 0.6% (n=2), albeit the resistance mechanisms

271

was not characterised (47). However, Bwalya et al (2018) in Zambia reported a 3.3% PZA

272

monoresistance rate, with different pncA mutations (50). The MDR rate in Egypt was 12% (n=38) (Table

273

S1 & S5).

274

EMB-monoresistance rate was 1.9% (n=6), mediated mainly by M306V/I mutations (n=2) (2, 47) in

275

embB (3.1%, n=4) (Tables S1 & S3). Abbadi et al (2009) detected the highest STM-monoresistance rate

276

in Egypt, which was 13.5% (n=21), and was mainly mediated by rpsL gene mutations (55.6%) (47).

277

Morocco

278

Four studies conducted in Morocco undertook DST of 987 M. tb isolates, yielding a resistance rate of

279

32.7% (n=323), a RIF-monoresistance rate of 0.9% (n=9) and an INH monoresistance rate of 1.2% (n=12)

280

(Tables S1 & S3). S531L (n=48), followed by H526D (n=23) mutations in rpoB (23.2%, n=75)

281

predominantly mediated RIF resistance (Tables S1 & S4; FIG. 4). Karimi et al (2018) reported an INH

282

monoresistance rate of 17.1% (n=12) (23). The proportion of katG gene mutation was 26.3% (n=85)

283

whilst inhA mutation was 3.7% (n=12) (Tables S2 & S3), being respectively mediated by S315T (n=85)

284

and C15T(n=10) (at inhA’s promotor region) (Table S4; FIG. 4). The MDR rate in morocco was 2.6%

285

(n=26), and was comparable with the 2016 estimated incidence rate of MDR/RIF resistance cases in the

286

country, which was 1.8/100,000 (5). However, the 2016 national survey reported that the MDR/RIF

287

resistant TB cases among previously treated cases was 11% (5).

288

Sudan

289

The rate of antibiotics resistance in Sudan, based on three studies, was 67.9% (n=161) (11, 51-53). S531L

290

(n=36) and H526Y(n=5) were the commonest rpoB (43.5%, n=70) mutations associated with RIF

291

resistance (Tables S2 & S3). Abdul-Aziz et al. (2013) reported an INH monoresistance of 0.4% (n=1) in

292

Sudan (11). Mutations in katG and the inhA promotor region was mainly S315T (n=10) and C15T(n=7)

respectively, conferring high-level INH resistance. Moreover, the MDR rate in Sudan was 34.6% (n=82)

294

(Tables S1). The highest MDR rate, 100% (n=49), was detected in the year 2013 (53).

295

Tunisia

296

Three studies in Tunisia, encompassing 1322 clinical isolates, resulted in a 3.2% (n=42) resistance rate.

297

RIF monoresistance rate was not reported in any of the studies. D516V (n=8) and S531W (n=4) mutations

298

in rpoB (50%, n=21) commonly mediated RIF resistance (Tables S1-S3). This Tunisian result was lower

299

than the finding detected in Egypt 40.5% (2, 47, 54), Morocco 32.7% (23, 55-57), Sudan 67.9% (11, 51,

300

53), Mozambique 32.8% (58, 59); but higher than the report from Rwanda 0.6% (60) (Figure 2a).

301

Comparatively, the MDR rate in Tunisia was very low (Tables S1-S3).

302

West Africa: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Sierra Lone

303

Burkina Faso

304

A single study by Miotto et al (2009), using the MTBDRplus on 63 isolates, reported a resistance rate of

305

57.1% (n=36), and a RIF and INH monoresistance rate of 3.2% (n=2) and 7.9% respectively (Tables S1-

306

S3). D516V (43.8%), followed by H526D (15.6%), H526Y (15.6%), and S531L (9.4%) rpoB mutations

307

conferred RIF resistance in 72.2% (n=26) of isolates while mutations in katG, found in 86.8% (n=33) of

308

isolates, and mutation in inhA, found in 34.2% (n=13) of strains conferred INH resistance (Tables S4;

309

FIG. 4). The MDR rate was 46.0% (n=29), which is higher than the 2016 estimated incidence of 2%

310

MDR/RIF resistant-TB in the country (1.6/100,000) and the 2017 national survey report of 14%

311

MDR/RIF resistant-TB case among new and previously treated cases (5).

312

Ghana

313

The overall resistance rate in Ghana, based on 2505 M. tb isolates in four studies, was 20.5% (n=513),

314

which is higher than those of Tunisia (3.2%), Malawi (6.4%), Rwanda (0.6%), Guinea Bissau (9%),

315

Nigeria (13.3%) and Gabon (16.9%), but lower than those reported form other African countries (Tables

316

S1-S3). RIF and INH monoresistance rates in Ghana were 0.8% (n=20) and 6.9% (n=172) respectively.

S450L (n=35) and S531L (n=16) rpoB mutations (22.4%, n= 115), and V483G (n=6) and G332R (n=4)

318

rpoC mutations (1.9%, n=10) predominantly conferred RIF resistance (Table S4; FIG. 4).

319

S315T (n=364) mutation in katG (74.5%, n=382) and G204D (n=32) mutation at the inhA promotor

320

region (20.3%, n=104), was associated with INH resistance. However, Otchere et al (2016) detected

321

novel mutations in inhA (G204D), in ahpCpro (-88G/A and -142G/A), and in ndh (K32R) (61). The

322

MDR rate in Ghana was 4.2% (n=104) (Tables S1-S3), which was lower than the finding reported from

323

other African countries, but higher than those reported from Cameroon (3.7%), Tunisia (0.9%), and

324

Morocco (2.6%).

325

Guinea Bissau

326

A resistance rate of 9% (n=9) was reported by Rabna et al (2015) in Guinea Bissau using 100 clinical

327

isolates. S531L mutation in rpoB mediated RIF resistance (100%, n=10 isolates) (Tables S4; FIG. 4).

328

INH resistance was not detected in this study. In 2016, the estimated incidence of MDR/RIF resistant-TB

329

in Guinea Bissau was 11/100,000 (5).

330

Ivory Coast

331

Three research studies involving 261 clinical isolates in Ivory Coast yielded a resistance rate of 33%

332

(n=86) (62-64) and an INH monoresistance rate of 6.5% (n=17). D516V (n=27) and S531L (n=12)

333

mutations in rpoB conferred RIF resistance in 67.4% (n=58) of isolates whilst S315T mutation in katG

334

(88.4%, n=76 isolates) and T8A/C (n=11/n=16) mutation in the inhA promoter (37.2%, n=32 isolates)

335

conferred INH resistance (Tables S1-S3). The rate of MDR in Ivory Coast was 24.5% (n=64) (Figure 2d).

336

Nigeria

337

Dinic et al (2012) (65) and Senghore et al (2017) (38) characterized the mechanisms of first-and second-

338

line anti-TB drug resistance in Nigeria, which had a resistance rate of 13.3% (n=65) from 488 clinical

isolates. This result was similar to that of Tanzania (13.7%), but higher than those from Tunisia (3.2%),

340

Malawi (6.4%), Rwanda (0.6%), and Guinea Bissau (9%). RIF monoresistance rate was 1.2%(n=6),

2016, the estimated incidence of MDR/RIF-resistant TB among notified pulmonary TB cases was 5200;

343

and MDR/RIF-resistant TB among new and previously treated cases were 4.3% and 25%, respectively

344

(5). From the same report, laboratory-confirmed cases of MDR/RIF resistant-TB cases were 1686 (5).

345

Sierra Leone

346

From 97 clinical isolates, a 51.5% (n=50) drug resistance rate and a 1% (n=1) RIF monoresistance rate

347

were detected. S531L (n=8), H526R and H526Y (n=3) rpoB mutations (32%, n= 16 isolates) conferred

348

RIF resistance, albeit certain rpoB mutations at codons 511, 516, and 533 conferred no RIF resistance

349

(Tables S1-S3)(66). INH monoresistance rate, largely mediated by S315T (n=23) mutation in katG and

350

C15T (n=2) mutation at the inhA promoter, was 8.2% (n=8); high-level katG- and inhA promotor-

351

mediated INH resistance was 56% (n=28 isolates) and 4% (n=2 isolates) respectively (Tables S4; FIG. 4)

352

(66). STM monoresistance in Sierra Leone, mediated by K34R (n=11) and K88R (n=8) mutations in

353

rpsL, was 14.4% (n=14); rpsL conferred STM resistance in 38% (n=19) of the isolates. In Congo, 19% of

354

STM resistance was due to K43R rpsL mutation (67). Similarly in Egypt, K43R and K88R formed 13.2%

355

of rpsL mutations (Tables S4; FIG. 4) (47).

356

Central Africa: Cameroon, Chad, Gabon

357

Cameroon

358

Among 163 clinical isolates, the rate of anti-TB drugs resistance was 38.7% (n=63) (Figure 2a). S531L

359

(71.4%), H526D (14.3%), and D516V (14.3%) rpoB mutations conferred RIF resistance in seven isolates

360

(11.1%). S315T mutations (73% of isolates) in katG and mutations at -15 inhA promoter region conferred

361

INH resistance in 30.2% (n=19) and 28.6% (n=18) isolates respectively (Tables S1-S4; FIG. 4) (68). The

isolates) mediated RIF resistance (24) while INH monoresistance, conferred by S315T1 (n=30) in katG

370

(41.1%, n=30 isolates) and C15T(n=19) mutation at inhA promotor region (26%, n=19 isolates), was

371

13.5% (Tables S1-S4; FIG. 4).

372

Gabon

373

Alame-Emane and his colleges (2017), using GeneXpert remnants, reported a drug resistance rate of

374

16.9% (n=21) and an MDR rate of 14.5% (n=18)(69), albeit the estimated MDR/RR-TB incidence in

375

Gabon in 2016 was 20/100,000 (5). S531L and D516Y (n=6) rpoB mutations conferred 100% RIF

376

resistance (n=21) while katG (76.2%, n=16) and inhA (81%, n=17) mutations conferred INH resistance

377

(Tables S1-S4; FIG. 4).

378

East Africa: Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda

379

Ethiopia

380

Next to South Africa, Ethiopia reported many studies (12 studies; 2,779 clinical isolates) that

381

characterised TB drug resistance mechanisms, totalling a resistance rate of 35.7% (n=991) and an MDR

382

rate of 23.9% (n=665). RIF monoresistance rate in Ethiopia was 3.1% (n=84), mediated by S531L

383

(n=485) and H526Y (n=55) mutations in rpoB (62.6%, n=612). INH monoresistance rate in Ethiopia was

384

3% (n=84), conferred by S315T(n=633) in katG (79.1%, n =784) and C15T (n=22) mutation at inhA

385

promotor region (4.5%, n =45). The highest MDR rate was reported by Abate et al (2014), which was

386

58% (n=427) (48). However, the 2016 estimated incidence of MDR/RR-TB was 5.7/100,000, and

391

Umubyeyi et al (2007) determined the rate and mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance among 701

392

isolates in Rwanda to be 0.6% (n=4) and gyrA (100%, n=4)-mediated, respectively (60); T80A (n=3) and

393

N94A (n=1) gyrA mutations mediated ofloxacin (OFL) resistance. OFL resistance rate in Mozambique

394

was however 1.9% (n=6) (58).

395

Tanzania

396

Three studies, comprising 226 clinical isolates, yielded a resistance rate of 13.7% (n=31) in Tanzania

397

while the MDR rate was 6.2% (n=14). The highest MDR rate was reported in 2013, i.e. 59.1% (n=13/22),

398

albeit a significant reduction of 1.4% (n=1/74) was reported by Kidenya et al (2018) (70). Estimated

399

MDR/RR-TB rate in new and previously treated cases were 1.3 % and 6.2%, respectively in 2016 (5).

400

RIF, INH, EMB and STM monoresistance rates were 0.9% (n=2), 3.1% (n=7), 0.9% (n=2), and 1.8%

401

(n=4) respectively. STM monoresistance however dropped from 2.3% (n=3) in 2007 (71) to 1.4% (n=1)

402

in 2018 (70) (Tables S1-S3). S531L(n=4) mutation in rpoB (54.8%, n=17 isolates), katG (58.1%, n=18

403

isolates) and inhA (9.3%, n=3 isolates) mutations, M306V/I and E378A (n=2) mutations in ebmB (29%,

Botswana

421

The overall resistance and MDR rates of 260 clinical isolates in Botswana were respectively 7.7% (n=20)

422

and 1.5% (n=4), with an INH and RIF monoresistance rate of 4.2% (n=11) and 1.9% (n=5) respectively.

423

Resistance to RIF and INH were mediated by rpoB (95%, n=19 isolates) and katG (65%, n=13 isolates)

424

gene mutations (Tables S1-S4; Fig. 4)

425

Malawi

426

In Malawi, the overall TB resistance rate among 995 clinical isolates was 6.4% (n=64). H526Y (n=11)

427

and S531L (n=10) mutations in rpoB 57.8% (n=37) mediated RIF resistance (Tables S1-S4; Fig 4).

previously treated cases were 3.7% and 20%, respectively in 2016(5) (Tables S1-S3). The monoresistance

South Africa

442

The overall TB resistance rate in South Africa was determined to be 16.8% (n=8197) among 48 760

443

isolates, which was lower than that of Sudan (67.9%), Zimbabwe (100%), and Burkina Faso (57.1%). The

444

MDR rate was 4.5% (n=2189) and was lower than that of Sudan (34.6%), Ethiopia (23.9%), Ivory Coast

445

(24.5%), and Burkina Faso (46%). The 2016 MDR/RR-TB incidence was 34/100,000 population and the

446

estimated rate of TB cases with MDR/RR-TB among new and previously treated cases were 3.4% and

447

7.1%, respectively (5). In the same report, the estimated MDR/RR-TB cases among notified pulmonary

448

TB cases was 8200, whilst laboratory confirmed MDR/RIF resistant-TB cases was 19073 (5). Out of 33

449

studies that determined the resistance mechanisms of first- and second-line drugs, 12 reported on the

450

XDR rate, which was found to be 1.6% (n=781). Laboratory confirmed XDR-TB cases in South Africa in

451

2016 was 967 (5).

452

Monoresistance rates of RIF, INH, EMB, STM, CAP, KAN and OFL were 0.01%(n=4), 0.3% (n=163),

453

4.2% (n=2049), 0.01(n=7), 0.1% (n=31), 0.04% (n=20) and 0.01% (n=3). S531L(n=478), D616V

454

(n=149), and 516GTC (n=167) mutations in rpoB (25%, n=2053), A542A (n=80) and V483G (n=48)

455

mutations in rpoC (2.4%, n=193) and rpoA 0.05% (n=4) mutations respectively conferred high-level,

456

low-level and low-level RIF resistance (Fig. 4; Tables S1-S4).

457

The predominant mechanisms conferring resistance to INH were S315T (n=672) in katG (21.9%,

458

n=1798) and C15T (n=294) at inhA promotor region (9.2%, n=758) whilst M306I mutation (n=472) in

459

embB (7%, n= 573) mediated EMB resistance. In addition, A1401G (n=639) and A513C (n=398)

460

mutations in rrs (15.1%, n=1241), K43R (n=10) mutation in rpsL (0.1%, n=12) and eis mutation (n=13)

461

mediated resistance to STM and CAP; rrs confers mono and cross resistance to CAP (60.5%, n=75). A

462

high frequency mutation was observed at the rrs1400 (n=26) and rrs900(n=22) loci of rrs (75). As well,

463

D94G (n=218) and A90V (n=168) mutation in gyrA 8.9% (n=728) and mutations in gyrB (0.7%, n=61)

464

mediated resistance to OFL (Figure 4; Table S4).

Takawira et al (2017) characterized rpoB and katG genes in MDR-TB isolates (100%) to respectively

467

determine RIF and INH resistance mechanisms (18). RIF resistance was mainly mediated by rpoB

468

(93.5%, n=86) mutations such as S531L and novel ones such as G507S, T508A, L511V, del513-526,

469

P520P, L524L, R528H, R529Q and S531F; novel mutations such as I572P/F, E562Q, P564S, and Q490Y

470

were outside the RIF resistance determining regions (Tables S1-S3). Inconsistencies between genotypic

471

and phenotypic assay results for both katG and rpoB genes were observed (18).

472

Molecular epidemiology: Lineage and family distribution

473

All the seven lineages of M. tb species and M. bovis were found in the included studies with varying

474

distribution frequencies per country (Figures 6 and S1). The Euro-American Lineage (Lineage 4) had the

475

largest frequency distribution among all the lineages in Africa, followed by Beijing (Lineage 2), Central

476

Asian (Lineage 3), West African I (Lineage 5) and II (Lineage 6), Indo-Oceanic (Lineage 1), Ethiopian

477

(Lineage 7) and M. bovis (Lineage 8) lineages. The frequency distribution of the sub-lineages among

478

these eight lineages are shown in Figure S1, and these varied per country. For instance, most of the

479

Beijing strains were reported from South Africa whilst the T and LAM sub-lineages were very common

480

in Northern, Eastern and Southern African countries; specifically, the T lineages were very dominant in

481

most of the countries (Fig. 6). The H family was also commonly found in Northern Africa. As expected,

482

the CAS strains were very common in Central and Eastern Africa, Madagascar, and Malawi, whilst the

483

West African I and II strains, the Cameroon strains, and Sierra Leone strains were mainly found in West

484

African countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Chad, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Furthermore, the

485

Congo and Uganda strains were more prevalent in Central and Eastern Africa whilst EAI lineages were

486

reported from mainly Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Eastern and Southern African countries (Fig. 6 and S1;

487

Supplementary dataset 2).

Phylogenomics: evolutionary genomic epidemiology

491

while Figures 7c and 7d represent only resistant strains. The lineages and sublineages of the individual

492

strains were not included in their metadata and could thus not be included in the trees. Most of the isolates

493

were from South Africa, Swaziland, Mali, and Uganda, and these are shown as unique colours on the

494

trees. Most of the resistant isolates were from South Africa. Notably, there was relatively minor trans-

495

boundary transmission of closely related strains/clones while most of the isolates were localized within

496

countries.

497

Diagnostics

498

Phenotypically, the BACTEC MGIT 960 system and the agar proportion methods were commonly used

499

to diagnose M. tb and determine antibiotic sensitivity from clinical specimens. The methods and

500

instruments used differed from country to country (Tables 2, S3 & S5). Molecular tests such as PCR and

501

amplicon sequencing, Hain’s line probe assays (GenoType®MTBDR), GeneXpertMTB/RIF and

502

currently, WGS, were commonly used in 122 studies to both identify and determine drug resistance in M.

503

tb. More studies from South Africa (n=33) and Ethiopia (n=13) used molecular methods to both detect M.

504

tb and ascertain its resistance profile (Tables S3 & S5).

505

4. Discussion

506

The epidemiology of antitubercular drug resistance in Africa, as shown in this review, is phylogenetically

507

limited to countries than across countries, and were mediated by non-lineage-specific mutations. Notably,

508

INH and RIF, which are the most important and main first-line anti-TB drugs, had the most resistance

509

prevalence in many African countries. The high proportion of INH resistance could be due to the relative

510

ease and alacrity with which resistance mutations developed to this antibiotic. The genes in which

511

mutations usually occur to confer resistance to first-and second-line anti-TB antibiotics include: rpoB,

512

rpoA, and rpoC (RIF); katG and inhA (INH); pncA (PZA); embCAB (EMB); rpsL, rrs, and gidB (STM);

513

rrs and eis (KAN/AMK); rrs and tlyA (CAP); gyrA and gyrB (Fluoroquinolones); ethA, ethR, and inhA

(ETM); thyA and ribD (Para-aminosalicylic-acid); alr, ddl, and cycA (Cycloserine); atpE (Bedaquiline);

515

rrl and rplC (Linezolid) (2, 27, 76).

516

RIF is a broad-spectrum drug that interferes with the synthesis and elongation of mRNA by binding to the

517

β-subunit of RNA polymerase, an enzyme encoded by the rpoB gene in M. tb. Mutations occurring in the

518

81bp hypervariable region of the rpoB gene reduces the binding affinity of RIF to RNA polymerase,

519

leading to RIF resistance in 96% of RIF-resistant isolates (29). RIF resistance-conferring mutations in the

520

rpoB gene mainly occurs between codon 507 and 533, which is called the RIF-resistance-determining

521

region (RR-DR) (48, 49). In most cases, mutations that occurred at codon 531 and 526 results in RIF

522

resistance (48). Abbadi et al (2009) observed that 76% of resistance-conferring mutations in the rpoB

523

gene in Egypt was due to S351L (47). Abate et al (2014) also revealed that 68.7% of RIF-resistant strains

524

in Ethiopia had mutations at codon 531 (S531L) (48). Moreover, rpoB mutations at codons 531 and 526

525

have been reported by several studies in different African countries to confer RIF resistance (36, 47, 48,

526

64, 77-81). As well, rpoB mutations at codon 516 has been reported by other studies to confer RIF

527

resistance (Tables S1-S4).

528
529

INH is a prodrug that needs activation by a catalase enzyme encoded by the katG gene. Mutations in the

530

katG gene, most commonly occurring at codon 315, lower catalase-peroxidase activity and result in high-

531

level INH resistance. Feuerriegel et al. (2012) (66) and Abate et al (2014) (48) respectively found that

532

72% and 93% of katG gene mutations occurred at codon 315 (S315T) in Sierra Leone and Ethiopia.

533

These have been corroborated by several studies from different African countries, which also found

534

mutations at codon 315 in katG as mediating high-level INH-resistance (Figures 3-6; Tables S1-S4).

535

Mutations at the promotor region of inhA also induce low-level INH resistance (Figures 3-6; Tables S1-

536

S4)(29). The inhA mutations also mediate resistance to another second-line drug, ETM, due to the similar

537

molecular structure of the two drugs (29). Activated INH prevents the synthesis of mycolic acids by

538

inhibiting NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase, which is encoded by inhA (29). N'Guessan et al.

539

(2016) showed that 45% of inhA mutations contributed to INH resistance in Ivory Coast(63).

540

The high proportion of INH resistance could be due to the easy propensity for resistance mutation to be

541

developed in katG and inhA. Ba Diallo et al. (2017) in Chad, from their study on the emergence and

542

clonal transmission of MDR-TB, found 13.5% INH-monoresistance (24) while N'Guessan et al (2008) in

543

Côte d’Ivoire reported 8.7% INH-monoresistance (64); three previous studies in Egypt reported 7%, 4%,

544

and 12.5% INH-monoresistance rate (2, 47, 54). Considerable proportion of INH mono-resistance rate

545

i.e., 1.7%-11.6%, was also reported from Ethiopia (12, 78, 83, 84), and 7.4%-10.9% in Ghana (19, 61,

546

85), with INH monoresistance in Ghana increasing from 2015 to 2018: in 2015, it was 8.2% (n=43/525)

547

(19), in 2016 it was 7.4% (n=111) (61), and in 2018, it was 10.9% (n=18) (85). However, the highest

548

INH-monoresistance rate, i.e. 13.5 % (42 INH mono-resistant isolates), was in Chad (24) (Figure 2b).

549
550

EMB, a first-line TB drug, interferes with the biosynthesis of cell wall arabinogalactan (66). Several

551

studies reported that 50% of EMB resistance is mainly due to mutation in embB gene at codon 306 (66,

552

81). In agreement to this, other previous studies have shown that common embB gene mutations

553

conferring EMB resistance occurred at codon 306 (32, 35, 45, 72, 86, 87). Feuerriegel et al (2012) (66)

554

and Dookie et al (2016) (88) revealed that 46.7% and 86% of EMB resistance was due to embB gene

555

mutation(s) at codon 306 in Sierra Leone and South Africa respectively; in the study by Dookie et al

556

(2016), 90.7% of isolates with EMB resistance had mutations in the embB gene (88). In addition, other

557

common mutations in embB, besides those at codon 306, confer EMB resistance in different African

558

countries (32, 35, 45, 72, 86, 87). EMB monoresistance in Sudan was 1.3% (n=3) (11), but the

559

mechanisms of resistance (gene mutation) was not determined, which could be due to the diagnostic they

560

used. This result was similar to that from Egypt, which was 1.9% (2, 47); but less than that of

561

Mozambique (2.8%, n=9) (58) and higher than that of South Africa (0.01%, n=4) (89).

563

STM is an aminocyclitol glycoside antibiotic, which hinders the initiation of translation by binding to the

564

16S rRNA. STM resistance is mostly mediated by mutations in the rrs or rpsL gene, which alters the

565

STM-binding region to prevent STM binding. Mutations in rrs and rpsL genes have been identified in

566

more than 50% of the STM-resistant isolates, with the most common rpsL mutation being at codon K43R

567

and K88R (29). Aubry et al (2014) reported that 19% of STM-resistance was due to K43R mutation in

568

rpsL in Congo (67). A similar finding was reported by Abbadi et al (2009) in Egypt, where 13.2% of

569

rpsL mutations occurred at codon K43R and K88R (47). Similar findings of rpsL mutation at K43R and

570

K88R has been reported by other studies (32, 36, 38, 66). Furthermore, mutation(s) in the gidB gene,

571

which encodes a conserved 7-methylguanosine methyl transferase specific for the 16S rRNA, can mediate

572

low-level STM resistance. Tekwu et al. (2014) revealed that 11.1% (n=7) of STM-resistance was due to

573

gidB mutation at different hotspot regions in Cameroon (68). One study from Sierra Leone revealed that

574

50% of STM-resistance was due to gidB mutation (66).

575
576

The STM mono-resistance rate in Africa was found to be 0.1% (57 STM mono-resistant isolates), being

577

lower than that reported in individual countries: 14.4% (66) in Sierra Leone, 10% in Sudan and 7.9% in

578

Egypt. The highest EMB monoresistance was reported from Mozambique i.e. 2.8% (n=9 isolates).

579

Monoresistance to all the three second-line injectable drugs was reported from South Africa: CAP

580

(0.05%, n=31 isolates), kanamycin (KAN) (0.03%, n=20 isolates) (Table S1-S3).

581

Feuerriegel et al (2012) conducted molecular sequencing analysis of first-line anti-TB drugs to

582

characterize the mechanisms of resistance. The study identified different amino acid/codon changes in

583

drug sensitive strains as well (66), implying that the presence of different amino acid/codon change at the

584

hotspot region of certain genes does not corroborate a drug-resistant phenotype.

585

MDR & XDR rates

587

with MDR phenotypes. Besides South Africa, Ethiopia, and Ghana, where a substantial number of studies

588

involving numerous isolates were used, the MDR rates in most of the studies undertaken in the other

589

countries involved relatively few strains. Nevertheless, countries with lesser sample numbers but higher

590

MDR rates requires urgent attention. For instance, Swaziland and Zimbabwe had very high MDR rates

591

although their sample sizes were smaller. The dearth of comprehensive studies to identify MDR strains in

592

Africa should be urgently addressed to aid policy decisions with regards to TB interventions.

593

Furthermore, XDR rates were obtained only from South Africa as the studies from other countries did not

594

provide such data. This implies that other African countries had limitations to detect XDR-TB, due to

595

either financial constraints or unavailability of molecular diagnostic assays for detecting and

596

characterizing Pre-XDR and XDR-TB. This confirms the need to increase M. tb resistance epidemiology

597

studies in Africa to inform evidence-based decisions.

598
599

The MDR rates obtained in this study either varied or agreed with those from the national survey reports

600

of the respective countries. The MDR rate in morocco was 2.6% (n=26) and was comparable with the

601

2016 estimated incidence rate of MDR/RR-TB cases, which was 1.8/100,000 (5); the 2016 national

602

survey reported that the MDR/RR-TB cases among previously treated cases was 11% (5). However, the

603

2016 national Sudan survey report showed that the MDR/RR-TB in new and previously treated case were

604

2.9% and 13%, respectively; the incidence rate of MDR/RR-TB was 3.1/100,000 (5). This result was

605

higher than the report from Morocco (2.6%) (23), Egypt (12%) (47), and Ethiopia (23.9%) (48). The

606

MDR rate in Tunisia i.e. 0.9% (n=12) (90) (Figure 2D), tallied with the country's 2016 estimated

607

incidence of MDR/RR-TB, which was 0.4/100,000; MDR/RR-TB cases among new and previously

608

treated cases were 0.93 % and 4.2%, respectively (5). In 2016, the estimated incidence of MDR/RR-TB in

609

Ghana was 3/100,000; however, the 2017 national survey reported that MDR/RR-TB case among new

610

and previously treated cases were 1.5% and 7%, respectively (5).

611

In neighboring Ivory Coast, an MDR rate of 87.3% (n=55) (63), which was virtually similar to the 2017

612

national survey report, was reported. In 2016, the estimated incidence of MDR/RR-TB in Ivory Coast was

8.9/100,000 whilst the 2017 national survey on MDR/RR-TB case among new and previously treated

614

cases were 4.6% and 22%, respectively (5). The MDR rate in Egypt was comparable to the 2011 national

615

survey report, which had 14% MDR/RR in new TB cases, but lower than the 2016 national survey report

616

for MDR/RR cases (20%) among previously treated cases (5).

617

Molecular epidemiology

618

Molecular genotyping is a significant tool for tracing genotype/strain distribution in different

619

geographical settings. These techniques can predict transmission rates and identify dominant strains in

620

limited settings, strains that stand a chance of spreading and those related to outbreaks (42), severe

621

disease (41), and drug resistance. Isolates with a very close phylogenomic relationship are more likely to

622

have evolved from the same ancestor at some point and their presence in the same patient may suggest

623

within-host evolution or exposure to multiple patients who were infected from the same or closely related

624

strains. Such closely related strains provide invaluable data on disease transmission epidemiology (91).

Notably, both the phylogenomics and the lineage/family distribution per country support localized or

The country- and region-specific prevalence of the lineages suggests limited intercountry spread of M. tb

641

to what has been reported. For instance, atypical Beijing lineages in Africa were shown to be associated

642

with specific amino acid changes in genes including rpoB (D516V), katG (S315T), inhA (G17T), embB

643

(M306I), rrs (A513C, A1401G) (35, 45, 86). Muller et al, (2013) mentioned that R86 strains have high

644

degree of clustering for drug resistance mutation patterns that affects more than 40% of all MDR patients,

645

including mutations associated with resistance to first and second-line antibiotics (35). However, meta-

646

analyses of the collated data shows that these mutations are also found in other strains and lineages in

647

almost all countries. The presence of similar mutations in different lineages and countries suggests that

648

such mutations are not lineage or country specific (Table S4 & S6). We thus believe that the limited view

649

provided by the relatively small sample sizes used in individual studies per country could not provide a

650

wholistic overview of resistance mutation distribution per lineage, leading to a skewed conclusion.

651
652

In cases where lineages or families in certain countries and studies have been shown to be more resistant

653

to certain antibiotics, caution should be exercised in generalizing such results as the local TB management

654

culture, diagnostics used and endemic/circulating drug-resistant strains could be determining factors.

655

Even when lineages and families were found to be more resistant to certain antibiotics, the underlying

656

resistance mechanisms differed between studies and/or lineages/families. Furthermore, where such

657

lineage-specific mutation observations have been made in one country, it has not been found to be the

658

case in all other countries, limiting its widespread application (Tables S1-S6). Some few examples below

659

shall suffice.

660
661

Ba Diallo et al., in Chad, identified that SIT61(Cameroon family) had higher proportion of resistance to

662

RIF, INH and PZA, being respectively mediated by mutations in rpoB (S531L), katG (S315T1) and pncA

663

(Del143R) (24). In agreement to this, Otchere et al (2016) in Ghana reported that Lineage-4 (Cameroon

664

family) had higher rates of RIF and INH resistance, also mediated by mutations in rpoB (S450L), rpoC

665

(G332R), katG (S315T) and inhA (G204D), respectively (61). In Ethiopia, the Haarlem sub-lineage was

666

more resistant to INH, with a common gene mutation at katG (S315T) (83), whilst the CAS-Delhi sub-

667

lineage was more resistant to RIF through mutations at rpoB (Codon 447-452) (92). Furthermore,

668

Feuerriegel et al.( 2012) showed that drug-resistant LAM strains harboured various resistance mutations

669

in rpoB (D516Y and S531L), katG (S315T and Q471R), inhA (C15T), embB (M306I and W332R), rpsL

670

(K43R), and gidB (G69D, G92D, L16R, A161A and Q127Stop) (66). As well, Bwalya et al., (2018)

671

observed that CAS1-KILI expressed resistance to PZA, mediated by mutations at codons S65S and D8N

672

while LAM11-ZWE had mutations at codons Q10R, D80N, G97A, W119C, R154G and A171V

673

(50)(Table S4 & S6). The presence of the above-stated mutations in other lineages and countries is

674

evident in Tables S1-S4 & S6, making it difficult to conclude on a country- or lineage-specific association

675

of resistance mutations.

676

Diagnostics used for detecting TB and determining TB resistance in Africa

677

In several resource-limited African countries, diagnosing drug-resistant TB is more challenging due to

678

inadequate bacteriological laboratory facilities and/or skill (20, 82). Molecular diagnostic methods have

679

an advantage over phenotypic methods particularly due to their short turnaround time and accurate

680

diagnostic result (20). A major concern with molecular tests is their ability to detect M. tb DNA even in

681

latent or cured TB patients, resulting in false positives. This is because TB DNA ca persist in patients

682

long after treatment. is the Currently, different molecular diagnostic methods are available to test

683

mechanisms of drug resistance (gene mutations) to a particular antibiotic (20, 26). Essentially, they all

684

work through a DNA amplification technique and can be classified into real-time polymerase chain

685

reaction (RT-PCR) assays, solid phase hybridization assays and sequencing technologies (20). The recent

686

advances and applications of WGS is however revolutionizing the diagnosis of TB and drug resistance

687

owing to its higher sensitivity, specificity, typing resolution and comprehensiveness, although its use in

688

Africa is still limited due to its higher cost and advanced skill required (Tables 2, S1-S3) (93). Unlike

689

culture-based tests, molecular methods do not need viable cells to diagnose TB and TB resistance, which

690

can also lead to false positives as TB DNA can remain in the host long after its death (94).

691

Line Probe Assay

692

The line probe assays (LPAs), GenoType®MTBDRplus and GenoType®MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience,

693

Nehren, Germany) are the most commonly performed molecular diagnostic tests to detect and

694

characterise mechanisms of drug resistance in Africa (Tables 2, S1-S3, S5). GenoType®MTBDRplus can

695

detect MDR-TB i.e., resistance to RIF and INH by detecting rpoB, katG and inhA promoter region

696

mutations whilst GenoType®MTBDRsl can detect XDR-TB by identifying both M. tb and its resistance

697

(gyrAB mutations) to fluoroquinolones (e.g. ofloxacin and moxifloxacin) and second-line injectable drugs

698

i.e., rrs and embB (17, 58). LPAs use immobilized probes on a solid support to detect specific M. tb DNA

699

targets and resistance-conferring mutations from smear-positive sputum samples or culture isolates, after

700

extraction and amplification of the DNA (79, 82); the probes are attached to a nitrocellulose strip (77).

701

The sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRplus (version 2) in detecting RIF and INH from culture were

702

100% and 87.9% respectively for RIF, and 100% and 94.4% respectively for INH (79). The same study

703

evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRsl (version 1 and 2) in detecting EMB and other

704

second-line drugs from cultured isolates and reported the following: EMB (60% and 89.2%), OFL (100%

705

and 91.4%), KAN (100% and 97.7%); agreements between the LPAs and MGIT were very high for INH

706

(k=0.93), good for RIF, OFL, and KAN (k=0.6–0.7) and moderate for EMB (k=0.5) (79). Another study

707

showed the sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRplus to detect RIF, INH and MDR to be respectively

708

98.9% and 99.4% for RIF, 94.2% and 99.7% for INH, and 98.8% and 100% for MDR compared with

709

conventional results (26). Similar studies by Bedawi et al.(2016) revealed that the sensitivity and

710

specificity of MTBDRplus for RIF and INH resistance were 80% and 99.6%, and 82.7% and 99.6%

711

respectively while the MDR results were 75% and 100% respectively (12).

712

MTBDRplus has several limitations in its application. For example, the amino acid sequence cannot be

713

screened; hence, silent mutations(s) in the probe region can result in the absence of one of the wild type

714

bands. Moreover, this method only screens the gene mutation in the locus of interest (target region) in the

715

rpoB, katG and inhA gene regions (33). Resistance due to gene mutation outside of the gene locus of

716

interest will not be detected. Finally, MTBDRplus may not be used for monitoring the progression or

717

success of treatment of patients with antimycobacterial therapy.

718

Xpert MTB/RIF assay

719

The GeneXpertMTB/RIF assay, which was endorsed by WHO in 2010 for the accurate laboratory

720

diagnosis of TB and drug resistance as well as to increase case detection rates in resource-limited

721

countries, is another commonly used diagnostic method in Africa (Tables 2 & S5). It is a real-time PCR-

722

based technique used for detecting M. tb and RIF resistance using a single-use cartridge with a turnaround

723

time of 2 hours (1, 94). The detection of M. tb and its RIF resistance can be done in an integrated and

724

closed system, and sample processing is automated (95). Unlike the LPA, GeneXpert can only detect TB

725

and RIF resistance and has low sensitivity to smear-negative samples. Helb et al. (2010) observed an

726

overall sensitivity of 98-100% and 72% sensitivity in smear-negative samples (96). Though the Xpert

727

assay is preferred due to its simplicity, rapidity, higher sensitivity, ease and safety during sample

728

processing and handling, its application in resource-limited countries is hampered by cost (5). Hence, few

729

African countries such as South Africa has implemented Xpert assay as the baseline diagnostic method

730

for pulmonary TB (97).

731

Conventional and real-time PCR

732

Besides commercial diagnostics, PCR is also used to amplify targeted regions of the M. tb genome, which

733

is afterwards sequenced with the ABI PRISM DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)

734

(Tables 2, S1-S4). Real-time PCR methods however, which is based on hybridization of amplified DNA

735

with fluorescent-labeled probes across DNA regions of interest (78), can detect both TB and its resistance

736

mechanisms (98). The amount of amplified DNA is directly proportional to the fluorescence signal, which

737

can be controlled on-line (20).

738

resonance energy transfer probe, molecular beacons, and bioprobes are commonly used (35, 86, 99).

739

However, designing a probe for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is costly (100); Beacon and

740

TaqMan probes identify commonly encountered SNPs in katG and rpoB, (20, 55, 101). Fluorescence

741

resonance energy transfer probes can identify multiple SNPs at a cheaper cost, making them ideal for

742

initial screening tests; however, they require two rounds of PCR amplification. (47). Real-time PCR not

743

only allow detection of targeted gene(s) or mutation(s), but also enables quantification of gene expression

744

(55). The other main advantages of real-time PCR methods are their short turnaround time (result can be

745

available 1.5-2.0h after DNA extraction) and low risk of contamination due to its closed single-tube

746

system (20). However, the equipment and reagents are expensive, and the techniques need well-trained

747

personnel; thus, its application in resource-limited countries are limited.

748

WGS

749

The advantages of WGS in TB diagnosis, typing and resistance detection has informed its adoption as a

750

routine tool in the UK for all suspected TB cases, a feat which is far in the future for Africa (94, 102).

751

Unlike other molecular methods, WGS provides DNA sequence information of the whole genome,

752

enabling the detection of hetero-resistance (both resistant and susceptible subpopulations) in mixed M. tb

753

populations, as well as detection of known and previously uncharacterized/unknown gene mutations

754

(103). However, not all gene mutations detected through WGS might confer drug resistance due to hypo-

755

or non-expression (52, 104). Although WGS is expensive and not easily available for routine detection of

756

drug resistance gene mutations, it is the most reliable method to study pleiotropic and polygenic genes

757

that may be involved in resistance to single or multiple drugs (20, 36). Hence, to understand the complete

758

drug resistance determinants in M. tb strains, in-depth DNA sequencing (WGS) could be performed (66).

759

However, for mutations concentrated/restricted to short segments of the genome or a gene, such as rpoB

760

gene analysis for RIF resistance, PCR-based targeted sequencing is expedient (47). One study reported

761

that WGS improved PZA resistance detection with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 94%; WGS was

762

used as gold standard to resolve discordance results from conventional methods (105).

763
764

Sanger sequencing is the oldest WGS platform and works by chain termination while Illumina, which is

765

the most common platform in the market currently, uses sequencing by synthesis and is better in its speed

766

and length of readout, producing an overwhelming 1GB of nucleotide per run (106). Pyrosequencing is

767

another sequencing-by-synthesis technique, which is used by the Roche 454 platforms for short read

768

sequencing and has been utilized for M. tb drug resistance detection (107). Marttila et al. (2009) revealed

769

that the sensitivity of pyrosequencing was 97.4% and 66.7% for accurate detection of RIF and INH

770

resistance, respectively (107). In another study, this technique detected important mutations in the rpoB

771

gene in 96.7% of RIF-resistant strains, in katG for 64% of INH-resistant strains, and in gyrA for 70% of

772

OFL-resistant isolates (108). Pyrosequencing was preferred over the Sanger method due to its improved

773

turnaround time.

774

Currently, the Illumina, PacBio and Nanopore sequencers are increasingly being used in well-resourced

775

laboratories to diagnose and type M. tb (94).

776

Molecular genotyping techniques

777

IS6110 RFLP

778

Molecular genotyping is a vital technique for the understanding of TB epidemiology. These techniques

779

can predict transmission rates and identify dominant strains, strains that stand a chance of spreading and

780

those related to outbreaks (42), severe disease (41), and drug resistance. Evidently, patients with

781

genotypically clustered strains are epidemiologically related, representing recent transmissions (91). The

782

first M. tb DNA typing technique to be widely employed was restriction fragment length polymorphism

783

(RFLP). Its standardized protocol was published in 1990 and is currently still used (110). The RFLP

784

technique makes use of IS6110 insertion sequence (110). There are up to 25 copies of IS6110 commonly

785

found in almost all strains of M. tb complex (111), but not present in any other species. M. tb strains are

32 | P a g e

However, it is limited by its short-read lengths (up to 20-50 nucleotides) (109).

786

differentiated by looking at the number and position of IS6110 as it varies between strains. The IS6110 is

787

the current gold standard for M. tb complex genotyping, given its superior discriminatory power over

788

other genotyping methods for M. tb complex (112).

789

Isolates from patients infected with epidemiologically unrelated strains of tuberculosis have different

790

RFLP patterns, whereas those from patients with epidemiologically related strains have identical RFLP

791

patterns (112). However, RFLP can only detect strains with fewer than six IS6110, necessitating the use

792

of other supplementary genotyping methods (112). Moreover, it is slow, cumbersome, labor-intensive,

793

technically demanding and requires a relatively large amount (2µg) of high-quality DNA. In addition, the

794

interpretation of data can be prone to errors. To get the required amounts of DNA, substantial colonies

795

must be grown from a clinical sample, which can take four to eight weeks of culturing. Furthermore, the

796

technique has poor discriminatory power for isolates with less than six copies of IS6110. Further

797

technological refinements resulted in the development of PCR-based methods, which are easier to

798

perform, require relatively smaller amounts of genomic DNA, and can be applied to non-viable bacteria

799

or directly to clinical samples (113).

800

MIRU-VNTR typing

801

In 2001, a rapid, reproducible typing method based on a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR),

802

using 12 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU), was developed (114). The MIRU-VNTR

803

method has a resolution power close to that of IS6110 RFLP when used in typing mycobacterial isolates.

804

MIRU are short (40-100bp) DNA elements found as tandem repeats and dispersed in intergenic regions in

805

the genome of M. tb complex (115). It is not yet known whether they are junk DNA, or whether they

806

contribute to biological function within organisms. Strain analysis is done by observing the number of

807

repeats at different loci as they vary per strain. The number of strain loci can influence the interpretation

808

of recent transmission rates, and therefore, an estimation of the rate of clustering; the number of loci that

809

can be used are 12, 15, and 24 (116-118). The type strain is assigned 12 digital numbers corresponding to

810

the number of repeats at each MIRU locus, forming the basis of a coding system that facilitates inter-

811

laboratory comparisons. Moreover, relative to the IS6110 RFLP typing, MIRU-VNTR profiling is fast,

812

appropriate for specific strains regardless of their IS6110 copy number and permits rapid comparisons of

813

global strains using a binary data classification system. Recently, a set of 24 MIRU-VNTR loci having

814

higher discriminatory power than the 12-locus system was described, which results in greater

815

performance than the combined resolution of both RFLP and spoligotyping (119, 120). Spoligotyping is a

816

rapid additional typing method used to increase the discriminatory power of MIRU-VNTR typing (121).

817

Spoligotyping

818

Spoligotyping is a PCR-based typing method that shows the presence or absence of unique spacer

819

sequences, which are found between the direct repeat sequences of the direct repeat (DR) region (113).

820

The DR region contains similar multiple 36bp regions interspersed with non-repetitive spacer sequences

821

of a similar size.

822

spoligotyping can be expressed in digital format (113, 122).

823

WGS

824

High throughput genome sequencing technology have an advantage over traditional genotyping methods

825

in distinguishing strains in populations with a high burden of M. tb and to assess the rate of transmission

826

in these settings (72, 123). Currently, the molecular typing techniques used for epidemiological and

827

evolutionary applications are IS6110 RFLP, MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping. However, recent studies

828

indicate strains with quite similar DNA fingerprinting patterns may harbor considerable genomic diversity

829

(14, 72). Hence, the application of WGS enables detailed understanding of the genetic diversity and

830

phylogeny of drug-resistant M. tb complex strains found in certain geographical areas (14, 93, 124). WGS

831

can discriminate relapse TB from re-infection and its resolution has greater advantage over traditional

832

genotyping technologies (93, 100).

833

Currently, there are different types of NGS platforms with high and moderate throughputs, such as:

834

Illumina (MiSeq, HiSeq, NextSeq and iSeq); Bio-Rad Laboratories (GnuBio); Thermo Fisher (SOLiD,

835

S5, personal genome machine [PGM], Proton); Oxford Nanopore (minION, PromethION, GridION);

836

PacBio (Sequel I, II and RS2); Qiagen (GeneReader); Vela Diagnostics NGS platform (Singapore). Most

837

of these sequencing technologies are used in only high-level (at referral-level) facility, with a few being

838

used in intermediate-level facilities (e.g. the minION, MiSeq and PGM). Although WGS is a highly

839

promising technology in the control of TB disease, it has several drawbacks to its application for clinical

840

use. Few of the challenges are: high amount and quality DNA are required; highly trained staff is needed

841

for sample preparations, processing and sequencing; large amount of raw data generated by NGS and

842

WGS presents challenge to users who are unfamiliar with bioinformatics skills (94).

843

5. Conclusions, limitations and recommendations

844

The molecular epidemiology, diagnostics, resistance mechanisms and rates in M. tb complex strains are

845

herein characterized on a country-by-country basis and in Africa, with INH and RIF resistance being

846

more pronounced in almost all countries. Notably, all the eight M. tb lineages were found in Africa, but

847

with different frequencies per country. As well, the clades of M. tb strains were more locally based than

848

transnational, suggesting minimal intercountry spread of same clones within Africa. Furthermore, the

849

resistance mutations underlying antibiotic resistance in M. tb were myriad, with specific mutation

850

hotspots being commonly found in all lineages and countries on the continent. Obviously limited by skill,

851

cost and accessibility to modern laboratories, the MDR rates in most of the included studies were

852

obtained from a relatively smaller sample size, albeit the values obtained are worrying, particularly in

853

Zimbabwe, Sudan, Swaziland and South Africa. Unfortunately, the XDR rate could not be determined for

854

all the countries except South Africa, further belying the dearth of necessary skill, adequate budget and

855

well-equipped laboratories to diagnose this life-threatening menace.

856
857

Advances in genomic engineering and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) techniques are increasing our

858

comprehension of this pathogens’ resistance mechanisms, which is critical for the development of rapid

859

diagnostics and antitubercular drugs (29, 125-127). The limited number of studies using WGS to

860

characterize strains limited the genomic characterization of the resistance mechanisms and epidemiology,

861

particularly as commercial M. tb diagnostics and typing tools only target very small regions of the

862

genome. Subsequently, the resistance mutations identified were repetitive as the same primers, probes and

863

diagnostics were used from country to country. Nevertheless, the monoresistance and MDR rates require

864

urgent attention from the respective countries to help contain TB in Africa.

Figure 2. Drug resistance rate and mechanisms of resistance (resistance determinants) of M. tuberculosis
in Africa, January 2007 to December 2018. (A) Rate of resistance to any anti-TB drug in Africa. Total
resistance rate (%) of M. tuberculosis isolates across African countries, calculated per total isolates in
each country; (n=number of resistant isolates). (B) Anti-TB drug monoresistance per country in Africa.
Each antibiotic's mono-resistance rate is calculated per total isolates in each country with known
resistance profile (n=total number of isolates). (C) Total anti-TB drug monoresistance rate per antibiotic
in Africa. The resistance rate of each antibiotic is calculated per total M. tuberculosis isolates with known
resistance in Africa (n=number of resistant isolates per antibiotic). (D) Multidrug resistance rate (%) of
M. tuberculosis across African countries; the number of MDR isolates is calculated per total isolates with
known resistance in each country (n=number of MDR isolates). (E) Frequency of isolates with resistance
mutations in each resistance gene per country in Africa.; the frequency of mutations per each gene is
calculated from total isolates in each country (n=number of resistant isolates). (F) Rate (%) of genes
having resistance-conferring mutations in African M. tuberculosis isolates; it is calculated by dividing
isolates with resistance genes by all resistant isolates in Africa (n=number of isolates with particular gene
mutation).
