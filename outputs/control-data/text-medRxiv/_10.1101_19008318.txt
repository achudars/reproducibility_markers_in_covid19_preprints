Abstract
Objective: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) interacts with AD pathology to promote disease
progression. Studies of APOE risk primarily focus on amyloid, however, and little research has
assessed its interaction with tau pathology independent of amyloid. The current study
investigated the moderating effect of APOE genotype on independent associations of amyloid
and tau PET with cognition.

Methods: Participants included 297 older adults without dementia from the Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Regression equations modeled associations between cognitive
domains and (1) cortical Aβ PET levels adjusting for tau PET and (2) medial temporal lobe (MTL)
tau PET levels adjusting for Aβ PET, including interactions with APOE ε4 carrier status.

Results: Adjusting for tau PET, Aβ was not associated with cognition and did not interact with
ε4 status. In contrast, adjusting for Aβ PET, MTL tau PET was significantly associated with all

cognitive domains. Further, there was a moderating effect of ε4 status on MTL tau and memory
with the strongest negative associations in ε4 carriers and at high levels of tau. This interaction
persisted even among only Aβ negative individuals.

Interpretation: APOE ε4 genotype strengthens the negative association between MTL tau and
memory independently of Aβ, although the converse is not observed, and this association may
be particularly strong at high levels of tau. These findings suggest that APOE may interact with

Introduction
For the past 25 years, research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been driven by an
amyloid-centric model of disease pathogenesis.1 This model purports that AD is initiated by
abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ ) accumulation, later followed by tau-mediated neurofibrillary
tangle formation, neurodegeneration, and downstream cognitive deficits.2,3 Accordingly, most
research on apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allelic effects, as the strongest susceptibility gene for
increased risk and accelerated onset of AD,4,5 has focused on its associations with Aβ . Research
has demonstrated that APOE is involved in the oligomerization, aggregation, degradation, and
clearance of Aβ ,6,7 and that ε4 carriers have increased incidence of Aβ PET positivity as well as
accelerated Aβ PET accumulation.8,9
Recent findings, however, also point to tau phosphorrylation as an early event in
preclinical sporadic AD, possibly even preceding the involvement of Aβ .10,11,12 The presence of
cerebral tau pathology in the absence of Aβ remains a controversial topic, with some
suggesting that this is a normal age-related phenomenon when confined to the medial
temporal lobe (MTL; see [13] for a review of primary age-related tauopathy, or ‘PART’) and
others citing evidence that it represents an early stage on the AD continuum.14 A recently
proposed AD diagnostic framework incorporating Aβ, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers
(i.e., A/T/N) reinforces the primacy of Aβ over tau by labeling Aβ alone as “Alzheimer’s
pathologic change” whereas tau alone is labeled “non-AD pathologic change”.3,15 Studies
investigating tau independently of Aβ are needed to further our understanding of biomarker
dynamics in preclinical AD.

APOE, TAU, AND COGNITION

Although animal studies implicate APOE in the formation of tau pathology
independently of Aβ ,16,17 there is a paucity of analogous research investigating APOE-related
effects on tau measured through cerebrospinal fluid or positron emission tomography (PET)
independently of one’s Aβ level. Specifically, studies investigating APOE, tau PET, and their
interactive effects on cognition in Aβ negative individuals are notably lacking. Given this gap in
the literature, we independently assessed associations between cognitive performance and (1)
cortical Aβ PET controlling for MTL tau PET, as well as (2) MTL tau PET controlling for cortical Aβ
PET, along with interactions with APOE ε4 status. For any interaction between PET and ε4
status, we also ran stratified follow-up analyses assessing these interactions separately among
individuals with negativity and positivity for the other pathology (e.g., tau by APOE interaction
on cognition in Aβ positive [A+] and negative [A-] individuals). We conducted these analyses
with the hypothesis that presence of an APOE ε4 allele would have a deleterious moderating
effect on the association between tau and cognition independent of Aβ PET level and
regardless of Aβ positivity status.

Methods
Participants
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as
a public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and
clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of

MCI and early AD. This research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all
participating sites, and written informed consent was obtained for all study participants.
Participants without dementia (n = 212 with normal cognition; n = 89 with mild cognitive
impairment [MCI]) from the ADNI were selected based on the availability of tau and Aβ PET
data acquired within 12 months of each other, as well as APOE genotype data (n = 297).

PET processing
Processing methods for ADNI Aβ PET (18F-AV-45, fluorbetapir) and tau PET (18F-AV-1451,
flortaucipir) have been previously described elsewhere (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/petanalysis-method/pet-analysis/). Based on extant processing recommendations, regional
standardized uptake values (SUVs) were intensity normalized using the whole cerebellum18,19
(Aβ PET) or inferior cerebellar gray20,21 (tau PET) to create SUV ratios (SUVRs). Tau PET data
were partial volume corrected using the geometric transfer method.22 For Aβ PET, a cortical
summary measure was created by averaging across FreeSurfer-derived frontal, cingulate,
lateral parietal, and lateral temporal regions of interest to capture early vulnerable regions for
Aβ deposition.18 For tau PET, a Braak stage I/II composite region was created by averaging
across FreeSurfer-derived hippocampal and entorhinal regions of interest to recapitulate tau
progression in early Braak stages.20,21
Although previous work has determined positivity thresholds via differing methods,23-25
positivity thresholds in this study were derived using conditional inference decision tree
regression with the ctree() function from the party package in R (https://cran.r-project.org/) in
order to: (1) remain consistent with prior derivations of tau PET thresholds in ADNI;21,26 (2)
maintain comparable methods in the derivation of optimal thresholds for both Aβ and tau; and

(3) independently derive thresholds for Aβ and tau, rather than determining thresholds for one
based on discrimination of the other biomarker.23,25 Thresholds were determined using binary
classification of individual SUVRs based on global cognitive function (i.e., Mini-Mental State
Examination scores) and were taken at the lowest-level bifurcation in the tree, unless otherwise
noted. A larger sample of individuals (n = 523) spanning all diagnostic categories (i.e.,
cognitively normal, MCI, dementia) with tau PET data and a subset with Aβ PET data were
included for threshold derivation. A threshold of SUVR > 1.14 was determined for cortical Aβ
positivity (A+/A-); although this threshold came from a higher-level bifurcation, it was selected
in order to maintain consistency with other commonly used Aβ thresholds (e.g., >1.11).18,27 For
tau PET, thresholds were first determined for higher Braak composite stages (i.e., >1.96 for
stage V/VI and >1.51 for stage III/IV), with individuals surpassing the positivity threshold for
higher stages iteratively removed during derivation of lower-stage thresholds, as described
elsewhere.26 Ultimately, a threshold of SUVR > 1.18 was determined for tau Braak I/II (i.e., MTL)
positivity (T+/T-), largely consistent with a previously derived threshold using similar methods
(>1.13).21

Cognitive testing
Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing including the
measures from the following domains: attention/executive function (Trail Making Test Parts A
and B, time to completion); language (confrontation naming [i.e., Boston Naming Test or
Multilingual Naming Test]and animal fluency); and memory recall (Logical Memory Story A
Immediate and Delayed Recall). All raw scores were converted to z-scores based on predicted
values from regression equations adjusting for age, sex, and education derived within a robust

normal control group (i.e., cognitively normal throughout their duration in ADNI) based on the
entire ADNI sample. Z-scores were then averaged within domains to create
attention/executive, language and memory composite scores. MCI was diagnosed using
actuarial neuropsychological criteria.28,29 Participants were diagnosed with MCI if they (1) had
two impaired scores in one cognitive domain or (2) had one impaired score across all three
cognitive domains.

APOE genotyping
All participants had APOE ε4 genotyping data available. ε4 carriers and non-carriers
were determined based on presence of at least one ε4 allele. Of the 297 participants overall, 99
(33%) were categorized as ε4 carriers (heterozygotes n = 82; homozygotes n = 17) and 198
(67%) as non-carriers.

Statistical analyses
Cognitive domain z-scores were shifted to a positive scale and Box-Cox transformed to
improve normality. Tau PET SUVRs were also Box-Cox transformed to improve normality. All
figures depict untransformed values to facilitate interpretation. Chi-squared tests and t-tests
assessed for differences in demographic variables, PET values, and cognitive composite scores
between ε4 carriers and non-carriers. Regression equations predicted demographicallyadjusted and Box-Cox transformed cognitive z-scores as a function of cortical Aβ PET SUVRs
while controlling for MTL tau PET SUVRs (model 1) and MTL tau PET SUVRs while controlling for
cortical Aβ PET SUVRs (model 2). Both models included linear and quadratic SUVR-of-interest
main effects controlling for APOE ε4 status and, in separate models, interactions with APOE ε4
status. For any significant linear or quadratic interactions, follow-up analyses examined these

interactions stratified by PET positivity status (e.g., tau PET and ε4 interactions for separately
for A- and A+ individuals). All analyses and figures were generated in R version 3.5.0
(https://cran.r-project.org/).

Results
Sample characteristics
Group differences between ε4 carriers and non-carriers are presented in Table 1.
Participants’ sex distribution and years of education did not differ between carriers and noncarriers, but ε4 carriers were younger. APOE ε4 carriers had a higher average cortical Aβ SUVR
and a higher proportion of Aβ positive individuals relative to non-carriers. Further, ε4 carriers
had a higher average MTL tau SUVR relative to non-carriers, although the proportion of tau
positive individuals was similar between groups. APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers did not
differ in any cognitive domain.

APOE by Aβ interaction on cognition
In models adjusting for tau PET SUVR and ε4 status, there was no linear or quadratic
main effect of Aβ on cognitive performance in any domain (all ts < |1.44|, ps > .15). Further, no
moderating effect of ε4 status was observed for the linear and quadratic associations between
cortical Aβ SUVRs and any cognitive domain (all ts < |1.24|, ps > .22) while controlling for MTL
tau PET SUVR.

APOE by tau interaction on cognition
In models adjusting for cortical Aβ PET SUVR and ε4 status, there was a linear main
effect of MTL tau for attention/executive performance (β = -.21, t = -3.46, p < .001) such that
higher levels of tau were associated with poorer attention/executive performance. There was

also a quadratic main effect of MTL tau for language (β = -.25, t = -3.46, p < .001) and memory
(β = -1.09, t = -2.45, p < .001) such that higher levels of tau were associated with worse
performance and this negative association was disproportionately stronger at higher levels of
tau. Further, a moderating effect of ε4 status was observed for the association between
quadratic MTL tau SUVRs and memory performance (β = .73, t = 3.54, p < .001) such that ε4
carriers exhibited a disproportionately stronger negative association between tau and memory
at higher levels of tau (see Figure 1). Notably, the moderating effect of ε4 status on quadratic
MTL tau-memory associations was upheld even among individuals who had not yet reached
Braak stage III/IV (β = .49, t = 2.91, p = .004). There were no moderating effects of ε4 status for
the associations between linear or quadratic MTL tau and language or attention/executive
performance (all ts < |1.59|, ps > .11).
Follow-up stratified analyses were conducted for the interaction between APOE ε4
status and MTL tau level on memory performance to examine the effects separately for Aβ
negative (A-) and positive (A+) individuals. Among A+ individuals, a moderating effect of ε4
status on linear MTL tau and memory performance was observed (β = 1.02, t = 2.17, p = .03)
such that higher levels of tau were more strongly associated with poor memory performance
among ε4 carriers (see Figure 2A). However, unlike in the model with the full sample, no
interaction was observed for the quadratic effect of MTL tau in this A+ group (β = .07, t = .79, p
= .43). In contrast, among A- individuals, a moderating effect of ε4 status on quadratic MTL tau
and memory performance was observed (β = .20, t = 2.12, p = .03) such that a negative
association between tau and memory emerged only for higher levels of tau among ε4 carriers
(see Figure 2B).

Discussion
Moderating effects of ε4 status on the association between AD PET biomarker levels and
cognition were observed only for associations between tau PET and memory, such that higher
levels of tau were associated with poorer memory performance only among ε4 carriers, and
this effect was disproportionately strong at higher levels of tau. Notably, this interaction was
observed independently of Aβ PET level as measured on a continuous scale and among
individuals who were Aβ negative via a threshold method. Further, independently of Aβ PET
level and ε4 status, tau PET was negatively associated with both language and
attention/executive performance. In contrast, when adjusting for tau PET level, no main effects
of Aβ PET or moderating effects of ε4 status on cognition were observed. These findings
suggest that tau interacts with APOE ε4 independently of Aβ to exert negative influences on
cognition, warranting a primary role for tau within the preclinical AD framework.3,30
As a consequence of the amyloid cascade model, the majority of research on AD over
the past few decades has focused on the role of Aβ in AD1 or, at the very least, investigated
other pathologic markers in the context of Aβ positivity—but less so among those with Aβ
negativity. Although a more recent model of AD pathogenesis known as the A/T/N framework31
has expanded its purview and purports agnosticism to the temporal sequencing of mechanisms
underlying AD pathogenesis, it still relegates tau in the absence of Aβ to an alternative
categorization of “non-AD pathologic change.” In contrast to these amyloid-centric models,
there is accumulating evidence in support of a continuum hypothesis in which tau pathology
accumulates in the brainstem and propagates to transentorhinal cortex independently of and
prior to Aβ .11,32,33 Only cases with tau positivity in the absence of Aβ and clinical dementia

would warrant “non-AD pathologic change,” but individuals in this pathologic category without
dementia are considered on the Alzheimer’s continuum.14 Additionally, recent research
consistently shows strong associations between tau PET and cognition that are not evident with
Aβ PET.34-36 Our findings of a moderating effect of APOE ε4 status on tau and memory
associations independently of Aβ , which persists among Aβ negative individuals, build upon
these prior studies to provide further support for the notion that tau has a role in AD nosology
independent from Aβ.
The mechanisms by which APOE ε4 exerts its deleterious effects are incompletely
understood, although both Aβ-dependent and -independent avenues have been explored. In
addition to its role in the aggregation and clearance of Aβ , APOE has been implicated in
neuroinflammatory processes, cerebrovascular alterations, and synaptic plasticity,37 but its
direct and indirect effects on tau pathology remain unclear. Evidence suggests that misfolding
and aggregation of tau may be directly influenced by APOE-relevant processes.17 Further, a
mouse model of tauopathy expressing different APOE genotypes demonstrated that ε4 knockin mice had, in addition to higher tau levels, higher microglial reactivity and tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-α) secretion, indicating an ε4-induced neuroinflammation independent of
Aβ.16 Thus, our findings may reflect possible APOE-mediated inflammatory processes
exacerbating tau-mediated neurodegeneration, resulting in the observed associations with
cognition.
Given findings that APOE regulates clearance of Aβ pathology,38,39 it is reasonable to
speculate that it may be involved in the clearance of tau pathology as well. Although pathologic
tau aggregates intraneuronally to form large fibrillar structures known as tangles, smaller

soluble oligomers exist both intra- and extra-cellularly. These toxic oligomeric tau species form
prior to tangles, spreading through neighboring cells in a transsynaptic process to seed the
aggregation of intraneuronal tangles.40 Soluble oligomeric tau species may exacerbate
inflammatory processes41 as well as inhibit post-synaptic proteins, reduce gliotransmitter
release, and impair long-term potentiation and memory.42,43 Reduced clearance of these tau
oligomers in ε4 carriers may potentiate these negative effects, resulting in the observed
strengthened associations between tau and memory performance among ε4 carriers.
When stratifying the tau-memory associations based on Aβ positivity, differential
patterns of ε4 moderation were observed. Among Aβ negative individuals, ε4 carriers exhibited
a quadratic effect such that a negative association between tau and memory emerged only at
higher levels of tau. In contrast, among Aβ positive individuals, a linear interaction was
observed such that the negative association between all levels of tau and memory was stronger
in ε4 carriers. It is conceivable that, in the context of high Aβ, tau is associated with poorer
memory even at relatively lower tau levels because the combined effects of Aβ and ε4 status on
neuroinflammatory processes lower the threshold such that less tau is needed to initiate
neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. Instead, when Aβ levels fall below the positivity
threshold, a higher amount of tau pathology in combination with ε4-associated processes may
be needed to exert a negative effect on memory, explaining the observed quadratic effect
among Aβ negative individuals. Notably, the strongest negative effects of tau on memory
emerged for both groups soon after the SUVR had surpassed the Braak I/II positivity threshold,
indicating a potentially important threshold effect for tau regardless of Aβ status. Further, given
the quadratic nature of the interaction such that effects on memory were most prominent at

higher levels of MTL tau, analyses were rerun among only individuals negative for Braak stage
III/IV; the ε4 interaction on quadratic MTL tau-memory associations was retained, suggesting
that the strengthened effect for high MTL tau is not driven by individuals who have reached
Braak stage III/IV.
The primary strength of this study was the investigation of the moderating effects of
APOE ε4 on both Aβ and tau PET independently, resulting in the novel finding that the
quadratic association between tau PET and memory was retained in ε4 carriers even among Aβ
negative individuals. Further, assessing multiple cognitive domains broadened the scope of
investigation beyond memory to demonstrate robust main effects of MTL tau on language and
attention/executive functions independently of Aβ level. However, generalizability is limited
given that this study was conducted in a racially/ethnically homogenous, clinic-based sample
with few medical comorbidities. Replication of these findings in a more representative sample
will better inform the range of pathologic and associated cognitive changes in AD. Additionally,
extending analyses to other regions of tau deposition and other pathologies such as TDP-43 and
cerebrovascular changes will provide more insight into the polypathologic nature of AD and the
widespread influence of APOE genotypic variations on disease expression.
Our findings suggest that APOE may exert deleterious effects on cognition through
specific interactions with tau pathology and that these effects may occur independently of and
prior to the amyloidosis of AD. This relationship has important implications for models of AD
pathogenesis by supporting an Aβ-independent role of APOE and tau during the preclinical
period of AD that is further amplified in the presence of high Aβ.
