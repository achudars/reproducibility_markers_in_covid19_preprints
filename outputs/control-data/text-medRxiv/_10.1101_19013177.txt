Abstract
Background: Mistletoe extracts are used as an adjunct therapy for cancer patients, but there is
dissent as to whether this therapy has a positive impact on quality of life (QoL).
Methods: We conducted a systematic review searching in several databases (Medline, Embase,
CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Science Citation Index, clinicaltrials.gov, opengrey.org) by combining
terms that cover the fields of “neoplasm”, “quality of life” and “mistletoe”. We included prospective
controlled trials that compared mistletoe extracts with a control in cancer patients and reported QoL
or related dimensions. The quality of the studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool
version 2.We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis.
Results: We included 26 publications with 30 data sets. The studies were heterogeneous. The pooled
standardized mean difference (random effects model) for global QoL after treatment with mistletoe
extracts vs. control was d = 0.61 (95% CI 0.41-0.81; p<0,001). The effect was stronger for younger
patients, with longer treatment, in studies with lower risk of bias, in randomized and blinded studies.
Sensitivity analyses support the validity of the finding. 50% of the QoL subdomains (e.g. pain, nausea)
show a significant improvement after mistletoe treatment. Most studies have a high risk of bias or at
least raise some concern.
Conclusion: Mistletoe extracts produce a significant, medium-sized effect on QoL in cancer. Risk of
bias in the analyzed studies is likely due to the specific type of treatment, which is difficult to blind;
yet this risk is unlikely to affect the outcome.

Background
Mistletoe has been used for centuries as a folk remedy, dating back to ancient Greek and Celtic
medicine [1, 2]. Today’s use of preparations of the European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) in
anthroposophic medicine and particularly the treatment of cancer patients has been introduced by
Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) in the 1920s [3] and developed further by Ita Wegmann and various
clinicians and pharmacists in this tradition. The basis for this development were, apart from the
traditional pharmacopeias, specific anthroposophic investigations involving the phenomenology of
mistletoe that grows as a semi-parasite on trees. These and other considerations led Steiner and
associates to try mistletoe treatment for cancer. Out of this suggestion a long tradition of empirical
knowledge has developed, especially in Germany and Europe. Viscum album extract (VAE) is applied
subcutaneously, normally two to three times per week whereas the complete treatment duration
varies from some weeks up to five years and more. Different products are available such as
ABNOBAViscum, Helixor, Iscador, or Lektinol.
Mistletoe contains biologically active molecules including lectins, flavonoides, viscotoxins, oligo- and
polysaccharides, alkaloids, membrane lipids and other substances [4]. Although the exact
pharmacological mode of action of mistletoe is not completely elucidated, there is a growing number
of biological studies with a clear focus on lectins. Lectins (from the Latin legere, “to select”) are
carbohydrate-binding proteins displayed on cell-surfaces to convey the interaction of cells with their
environment [5]. Lectins mediate many immunological activities: For example, lectins show an
immunomodulatory effect on neutrophils and macrophages by increasing the natural killer
cytotoxicity and the number of activated lymphocytes [6-8]. They induce apoptosis in human
lymphocytes [9] and boost the antioxidant system in mice [10]. In healthy subjects, the subcutaneous
application of mistletoe has stimulated the production of granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin 5 and Interferon gamma [11], indicating the
immunopotentiating properties of mistletoe. The multiple ways how mistletoe affects the immune
system have been recently reviewed elsewhere [12]. In consequence, the immunological pathways of

conventional oncological treatments may be influenced by VAE, affecting cancer cells and decreasing
adverse effects. This may result in a better quality of life (QoL).
A number of reviews has been published over the last two decades that address the effects of VAE
on QoL in cancer patients [13-19]. However, these studies are either out of date, don't make use of
all published evidence, and/or don’t combine the data quantitatively into a pooled effect size.
The aim of this study is therefore to review and analyze the current evidence regarding QoL of cancer
patients which were treated with VAE and to calculate a meta-analysis.

Methods
The study has been reported in accordance to PRISMA. The protocol was submitted to PROSPERO
(registration number: CRD42019137704).
Sources of evidence
We searched the databases Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, and
clinicaltrials.gov, we used google scholar, hand-searched the reference lists of reviews and identified
studies and screened for grey literature via Google and opengrey.org. In case of missing data we
contacted the authors.

Search strategy
We developed a search strategy by iteratively combining synonyms and/or subterms of “quality of
life” (e.g. well-being, QoL), “cancer” (e.g. neoplasm, sarcom, lymphom) and “mistletoe” (e.g. Helixor,
Eurixor) to identify an adequate set of terms. We applied the following search strategy for Medline
(Pubmed) and adopted it to the other databases accordingly:
1.

quality of life OR HRQoL OR HRQL OR QOL OR patient satisfaction OR well-being OR wellbeing

2.

mistel OR mistletoe OR Iscador OR Iscar OR Helixor OR Iscucin OR Abnobaviscum OR Eurixor

Selection criteria
We included studies that measured QoL or self-regulation of cancer patients treated with mistletoe
extracts assessed by performance status scales or patient-reported instruments. Studies were chosen
if they were


prospective controlled studies with



two or more arms,



both interventional and non-interventional.

The search was not limited to languages.
Studies were excluded if


they did not meet the aforementioned inclusion criteria,



if they tested multi-component complementary medicine interventions,



if they failed to report sufficient information to be included into the meta-analysis or



where this information cannot be gleaned from authors or extracted from graphs.

Data management
The data was extracted from each study and entered into a spreadsheet by two authors
independently. Then the extracted spreadsheets were compared and discrepancies were resolved by
discussion until consensus was reached. We coded the following characteristics:


number of participants in each treatment arm



year, when study was conducted; in case this was not given, we estimated a 3 year lag from
publication date for the meta-regression

If numerical data provided by the study publication was insufficient to calculate effect sizes, we
contacted the authors. In cases where additional data were provided by the authors, these were
then used instead of the published data. In older studies this was impossible. In those cases we used
the given information (for instance means and confidence intervals, or means and p-values, or
statistical information to generate the necessary data). In some cases we had to use medians as
means and recover standard errors of the means from the given confidence intervals which also
necessitated an adaptation of the confidence intervals into symmetrical ones. In each case we used

the more conservative option which yielded larger standard errors and hence larger standard
deviations. Thus, we generally opted for an error on the conservative side. When no quantitative
information was given, but only graphs were presented, we printed high resolution graphs and
derived the mean values and standard errors applying a ruler and used the given statistical
information to arrive at the necessary quantitative scores. All these procedures were conducted
independently and in duplicate [20].

Risk of bias (quality) assessment
The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 (Rob 2) was used to assess the risk of bias in randomized controlled
trials [21]. All studies were assigned to the intention-to-treat-effect-analysis. Non-randomized or
non-interventional studies were additionally analyzed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale [22]. Two
reviewers (HW, ML) independently assessed the risk of bias. In case of discrepancies they decided by
consensus.

Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V. 2 and Revman 5.3.5, the summary
measure was the standardized mean difference. The meta-analysis was calculated independently by
both authors using the two software tools Comprehensive Meta-Analysis and RevMan. The results
were compared and underlying discrepancies resolved by discussion until both analyses yielded the
same numerical results up to the second decimal. We report the overall analysis according to the
results yielded by the RevMan analysis and conducted sensitivity analyses with Comprehensive MetaAnalysis.

The heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Cochrane Q test and quantified by the index
of heterogeneity (I2) [23]. A value of I2 of 25%, 50% and 75% indicates low, medium and high
heterogeneity, respectively. If heterogeneity was higher than 25% we applied a random effects

model for pooling the data, else a fixed effects model was used. As heterogeneity was high for the
overall data-set, a random effects model was indicated. Fixed effect models were only used sparingly
in exploratory subgroup analyses or sensitivity analyses, when heterogeneity was low.

We conducted subgroup analysis in order to identify possible sources of the heterogeneity. Stratified
analyses were performed by: study types (e.g. blinded vs. not blinded, randomized versus nonrandomized, types of control), additional treatments, country, risk-of-bias status, type of sponsoring,
QoL instruments and related dimensions (in particular self-regulation), and mistletoe compound.
Type of cancer was not included, as there were too many different cancer types. We conducted
meta-regressions and regressed the three continuous predictors year of study, age of patients and
length of treatment on effect size. We checked for publication bias using Egger’s regression intercept
method and Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method [24].

Results
598 studies were identified by electronic and hand searches, after removing duplicates. 67 full texts
were retrieved of which 26 publications with 30 separate data sets met the inclusion criteria (see
figure 1) [25-50]. We contacted 14 authors for additional information which was granted by five [25,
29, 39, 49, 51].

90% of the studies were conducted in Europe including Russia, 50% in Germany, and 10% in Asia.
Three trials were blinded, four studies or datasets were not randomized. Different mistletoe
preparations with varying conventional treatments were compared to conventional treatment (alone
in 22 cases or plus an additional comparator in eight cases, respectively) for multiple types and
stages of cancer. In nine studies QoL was measured with EORTC-QLQ-C30, six studies assessed self8

regulation, and the others used one or multiple other instruments. The study characteristics are
displayed in table 1.

Insert here: tab. 1

The results of the overall meta-analysis are presented in Figure 2.
Insert here: Figure 2.

As can be seen the studies are highly heterogeneous (I2 = 84%), and hence the random effects model
is applied to estimate the combined standardized mean difference as d = 0.61 (96% CI 0.41-0.81,
p<0.0001, z=6.05).
The meta-analyses of the sub-dimensions of QoL are shown in table 2. The SMD of seven out of 14
QoL dimensions are significant (p≤0.05). The pooled SMD of role and social functioning are 0.63 (95%
CI 0.05-1.22) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.22-1.03), respectively. For pain, it is SMD=-0.86 (95% CI -1.54-(-0.18))
and for nausea, it is SMD=-0.55 (95% CI -1-(-0.1)).

Insert here: tab. 2

The risk of bias assessment is displayed in the figures 3 and 4. 65% had an overall high risk of bias
which resulted for most studies from the 85% high risk of bias in the measurement of outcome. This
can be attributed to the missing blinding process, the QoL assessment as patient-reported outcome,
and the uncertain appropriateness of some measurement instruments which may only incompletely
capture the concept of QoL.

The five non-randomized trials [30, 33-35, 42] were additionally assessed with the NewcastleOttawa-scale. All studies had an overall score of 7 out of a maximum of 9. The sums in the selection,
the comparability and the outcome/exposure domain were 3, 2 and 2, respectively, for all studies.

The sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Neither the methodological nor
other moderator variables showed strong deviations. With the exception of the non-randomized
studies (d = 0.38, p = 0.1), the studies conducted with Lektinol (d = 0.67, p = 0.1), and the studies
using an index measure (e.g. Karnofsky index) as outcome (d = 0.33, p = 0.1) all other moderator
analyses showed no appreciable differences between subgroups and yielded highly significant effect
sizes. In tendency, methodologically more rigorous studies yielded higher or equally high effect sizes
than less rigorous ones. Studies using active controls (d = 0.6, p = 0.004) did not differ from studies
using other controls (d = 0.65, p < 0.001). Various types of additional treatment did not show
differential effect sizes, except individualized best care, which, however, is an estimate based on only
one study and hence not reliable. Although the effect sizes of the various products vary, their
confidence intervals overlap, and hence suggest the conclusion that they are roughly equally
effective. There is no difference in effect sizes depending on countries, type of sponsoring, or type of

measures. Studies that relied on corporate sponsoring, and studies using only a single index measure
yielded a somewhat smaller effect size, although confidence intervals overlap and thus signal nonsignificant differences.

The three meta-regressions are presented in Table 4 and in Figures 5 and 6.

The study year is positively correlated with effect size. For each year the study was more recent the
estimated QoL-effect size is larger by d = 0.03. Although there is a tendency for a larger effect size in
younger patients this effect is not significant. The slope of the regression line for the duration of
treatment is borderline significant, indicating that longer treatment produces effects that are 0.04
standard deviations larger per additional treatment week that. Note though that only treatments
between 5 and 52 weeks have entered the analysis and the variance is not large.

Publication bias was estimated using two methods. Egger’s regression intercept model regresses
effect size on precision of study with the assumption that smaller studies that are less precise will
more often go unpublished. A regression line with a lot of smaller and more imprecise studies
missing should thus miss the origin by a large margin. In our analysis the intercept of the regression is
0.82 with a non-significant deviation from the origin (t = 0.65, p-value two tailed = 0.5). Duval and

Tweedie’s trim and fill method is an extension of the graphical funnel plot analysis and analyzes how
many studies would have to be trimmed to generate a perfectly symmetrical funnel plot. In our
analysis this method estimates no studies to be trimmed on the left side, i.e on the negative or low
side of the effect size estimate and an estimate of 7 trimmed studies on the right side, i.e. on the
positive side of the effect size funnel with an adjustment that leads to a higher effect size, if the
studies are trimmed. These two analyses of publication bias show that publication bias is not a likely
explanation of this result and any funnel asymmetries are not due to unpublished studies but due to
positive outliers.

Discussion
This meta-analysis shows a significant and robust medium-sized effect of d = 0.61 of viscum album
extract (VAE) treatment on QoL in cancer patients.
The results should be regarded in the light of the following facts:
The included studies vary with regard to the cancer site, the control intervention, the additional
oncological treatment, and the VAE. While sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness and
reliability of the findings, they could not account for the heterogeneity of the effect sizes. Neither
methodological moderators (blinded vs. unblinded studies, randomized versus non-randomized,
studies with high versus low risk of bias, active versus non-active control) nor structural moderators
(type of outcome measure, funding, VAE product used, additional treatment) could clarify the
heterogeneity. We suspect that this is due to multiple interactions between cancer types and stages,
treatments and structural variables that cannot be explored with a limited set of 30 studies.
Nevertheless, our sensitivity analyses document the overall robustness of the effect, as none of the
levels of moderators exhibits significant deviations from other levels or from the overall effect size.
This gives our effect size estimate of d = 0.61 reliability.

Although the overall risk of bias is high in many studies, one should bear in mind two aspects. First,
we applied the intention-to-treat-algorithm of Rob2 as the more conservative approach and not the
per-protocol evaluation which may have resulted in a better overall bias. Second, due to the local
skin reaction of VAE application the blinding of participants and carers is practically impossible and
could only have been implemented reliably with an active placebo, which is ethically questionable.
In Rob2 this leads to a high risk of bias in the measurement of the outcome. On the one hand, the
lack of blinding might have biased the results since most QoL are self-reported and there may be
strong beliefs among users of anthroposophic medicine which might additionally be fortified by the
severity of the disease and the hope that an additional treatment has a positive impact [52]. It was
shown that these attitudes are correlated with a better QoL [53]. On the other hand, there is no
evidence from the included studies that the attitudes differed between treatment arms and if
patients in the control group searched and used for surrogate medications for the VAE, this bias
would favor the comparator. Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis gives no indication that studies
with blinding and without blinding estimate different effect sizes and there is also no difference in
effect sizes between studies from Germany – where mistletoe is well known – and other countries
where mistletoe is less known and used. The results of the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale, finally, indicate a
good methodological quality for the non-randomized trials that were included in the review.

Another limitation is that self-regulation, the Karnofsky performance index, or the ECOG scale cover
important aspects of QoL, but are different in content from other measures such as the global QoL of
the EORTC-QLQ C30 scale. This source of heterogeneity was also addressed by our sensitivity
analyses. This showed that, indeed, as one would expect, single item indices estimate lower effect
sizes, although the difference is not significant. In the same vein, the inclusion of non-randomized
and non-interventional trials might have biased the results due to their lower internal validity, but
their exclusion during sensitivity analyses again did not alter the significance of the pooled outcome.

In addition, four of the five non-RCTs had a matched-pair design which increases the comparability
between treatment arms compared to other types of group allocation.
The meta-regression shows that more recent studies have higher effect sizes compared to older
studies. This is counterintuitive at first sight, as normally more recent studies are implemented with
more methodological rigor due to the GCP guidelines and a higher methodological skill of trialists.
This, one would think, should, if at all, lead to smaller effect sizes in more recent trials. The fact that
this is not the case shows, together with our sensitivity analysis that methodological bias is an
unlikely explanation for the effect size found. However, another point is worth bearing in mind:
earlier studies very often were implemented with very severely ill patients with tumor status IV or in
palliative care. Only in more recent studies was VAE also used as add on treatment in first line
patients with a relatively good chance of surviving. Thus the higher effect size for more recent
studies might also reflect the less severe status of these patients.

Our review has a number of strengths. First, we conducted a comprehensive search for published
and grey literature with no time or language limitation to minimize publication bias. Our analysis of
publication bias supports the conclusion that the effect size estimate is not due to publication bias.
Some authors who we contacted, however, failed to provide additional information and the
respective studies were consequently excluded. Second, we calculated a pooled SMD for a global
measure of QoL and for its subdomains such as pain or fatigue. Third, we analyzed the data both with
Revman 5.3 and CMA software which implements the Hunter-Schmidt-corrections for small sample
bias. We did both analyses in parallel and independently, thus preventing coding or typing errors
from biasing our results.

The weaknesses of this review are obvious. Any meta-analysis can only be as good as the original
studies entered. Some of these studies are large and methodologically strong. But some are also
badly reported, small and with a mixed patient load. In some cases we had to recalibrate confidence

interval estimates, because the data given were not detailed enough. Although it would have been
desirable, the variance between cancer types and stages was too large to allow for detailed
assessments and separate analyses, which might have reduced the heterogeneity. Although we can
testify to the robustness of the overall effect size estimate, we have not succeeded in clarifying the
heterogeneity of the studies. This requires multi-center studies in large cohorts of patients with large
budgets. Thus, one consequence of this meta-analysis would be to call for more serious efforts from
public funders to study the effects of VAEs in large and homogeneous patient cohorts to confirm or
disconfirm the results of this analysis.

Clinical relevance
Our results indicate a statistically significant and clinically valuable improvement of the subjective
well-being of patients with different types of cancer after the treatment with VAE. The analyses for
the subdomains revealed a significant pooled SMD for important symptoms and functioning indices,
whereas other show a positive, yet not significant effect of VAE compared to control. Whether these
vital elements of QoL such as emotional functioning or fatigue are influenced remain statistically
uncertain. Overall, a robust estimate of an improvement of d = 0.61 in quality of life represents a
medium-sized [54] and clinically relevant [55, 56] effect that makes VAE treatment a viable add-on
option to any anticancer treatment.

Conclusion
Our analysis provides evidence that global QoL in cancer patients is positively influenced by VAE.
Because the risk of bias and the heterogeneity is high, future research needs to better assess the
actual impact. Large studies in homogeneous patient populations are required to address these
problems.
