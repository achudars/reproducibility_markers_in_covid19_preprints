ABSTRACT
We characterized the prevalence, mechanisms, and sex difference of lifetime traumatic brain
injury (TBI) in a precariously housed sample. We also examined the impact of TBI severity and
timing on becoming and staying homeless. 285 precariously housed participants (adults n = 226,
youths n = 59) completed the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire (BISQ) in addition to other
health assessments. A history of TBI was reported in 82.1% of the sample, with 64.6% reporting
> 1 TBI, and 21.4% reporting a moderate or severe TBI (msTBI). 10.1% of adults had
traumatically-induced lesions on MRI scans. Assault was the most common mechanism of injury
overall, and females reported significantly more TBIs due to physical abuse than males (adjusted
OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.14 – 1.39, p = 9.18e-6). The first msTBI was significantly closer to the
first experience of homelessness (b = 2.79, p = 0.003) and precarious housing (b = 2.69, p =
7.47e-4) than was the first mild TBI. Traumatic brain injuries more proximal to the initial loss of
stable housing were associated with a longer lifetime duration of homelessness (RR = 1.04, 95%
CI = 1.02 – 1.06, p = 6.8e-6) and precarious housing (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 – 1.04, p = 5.5e10

). These findings demonstrate the high prevalence of TBI in vulnerable persons and the

severity- and timing-related risk that TBI may confer for the onset and prolongation of
homelessness.

INTRODUCTION
An estimated 2.5–3.5 million people experience homelessness annually in the USA, with
considerably higher estimates worldwide.1 Homeless individuals have significantly greater rates
of premature mortality, infectious diseases, and psychiatric illness than the general population.1; 2
Youth (aged 16–24) make up approximately 20% of the Canadian homeless population.3
Homeless and precariously housed youth may have differential risk factors and health outcomes,
and represent a uniquely vulnerable demographic within this marginalized population.4 Though
not formally ‘homeless,’ individuals who live in precarious housing (e.g., shelters, single-room
occupancy hotels, rooming houses, etc.) have comparable mortality, chronic health conditions,
and unmet health care needs.5; 6
Several recent studies have reported that homeless and precariously housed adults and youth
have a high (53%–65% adult; 43% youth) lifetime prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI).7-10
Unlike the general population, these homeless and precariously housed individuals most often
sustain TBI through violent mechanisms such as assault.11; 12 Moreover, homeless or precariously
housed individuals who report a history of TBI are more likely to endorse a history of psychiatric
diagnoses and substance abuse issues,13; 14 lower physical and mental quality of life,7; 8 seizures,7;
15

and higher rates of emergency department and primary care physician use.8; 14

The extent to which TBI is associated with becoming or remaining homeless or precariously
housed remains largely unexplored. Cursory examinations of the relationship between TBI and
the initial loss of stable housing have indicated that the majority individuals who had a history of
TBI reported receiving their first TBI prior to their first episode of homelessness.7; 10-12; 16; 17
However, these studies have not considered severity, i.e., whether moderate or severe TBI is
more closely associated with the initial loss of stable housing than is mild TBI. Furthermore, no
previous studies have evaluated the relationship between the timing of TBI and the lifetime
duration of homelessness or precarious housing. Given that TBI can result in long-term disability
and both neurologic and psychiatric disorders,18-20 TBI closer to becoming homeless or
precariously housed may be associated with a prolonged loss of stable housing. Evidence that

TBI contributes to the experience of homelessness has important implications for care delivery to
this vulnerable population, and for public health policy.
In this study we first sought to characterize the lifetime history of TBI in a precariously housed
sample by examining the lifetime prevalence, severity, mechanisms, and sex differences of TBI
in this population. We also stratified descriptive analyses by adults (≥ age 30 at assessment) and
youth (<29.9 at assessment) to capture differences in the lifetime burden of TBI. Second, we
sought to characterize the relationship between both the severity and temporality of TBI with the
onset and duration of homelessness and precarious housing. We hypothesized that more severe
TBI would occur closer to the initial onset of loss of stable housing. We also hypothesized that
TBI more proximal to the initial loss of stable housing would be associated with a longer
duration of homelessness or precarious housing.
METHODS
Study design and participants
The Hotel Study is an ongoing longitudinal prospective observational study of individuals who
live in precarious housing within an impoverished neighbourhood of Vancouver, Canada.
Methodology and baseline characteristics for the study sample have been reported previously.4;
15; 21

Briefly, between 2008 and 2017, staggered recruitment was used to enroll participants from

single-room occupancy hotels and the local downtown community court. Single-room occupancy
hotel rooms often fail to meet the minimum housing standards for Canada of being adequate,
affordable, and suitable, in that they are often in disrepair, cost more than 30% of total before-tax
household income, and house many tenants in facilities with limited space.22 Participants were
eligible for inclusion if they were 18 years of age or older, able to communicate in English, and
able provide written informed consent. Participants enrolled in the Hotel Study receive ongoing
monthly follow-up interviews for up to 10 years (e.g., urine drug screens, general medical and
symptom questionnaires, housing status), and yearly comprehensive neuropsychological and
physician-administered neuropsychiatric examinations, which include detailed assessments of
general and psychosocial functioning. Multimodal brain MRI is performed annually or

biennially. For descriptive analyses in the present study we evaluate adults (≥ age 30 at
assessment) and youth (<29.9 at assessment) separately.4 The study was approved by the Clinical
Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia and the Research Ethics Board at
Simon Fraser University in accordance with the Tri-Council Policy and Declaration of Helsinki.
Demographic and housing measures
Baseline sociodemographic data were collected by trained research assistants using structured
interviews at study entry. Psychiatric diagnoses at study entry were assigned by a psychiatrist
(WGH, OL) after reviewing all available clinical information with the Best Estimate Clinical
Evaluation and Diagnosis II in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental
Disorders-TR Fourth Edition criteria.23; 24 Housing history prior to study entry was collected as
part of the baseline sociodemographic interview. Alterations in housing status were updated
monthly during the study. In the present study, homelessness was defined as living on the street;
in shelters or vehicles; travelling or camping; having no fixed address; or couch surfing.
Precarious housing was defined as living in a single-room occupancy hotel room, rooming
house, or boarding house, according to the Canadian definition of precarious housing.22
Traumatic brain injury assessment and neuroimaging
Lifetime history of TBI was assessed with Part I of the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire
(BISQ).25 We classified the severity of TBI using the World Health Organization classification
of TBI severity in conjunction with the self-reported duration of loss of consciousness on the
BISQ.26 Mild TBI was considered to be any self-reported blow to the head, accompanied by loss
of consciousness for less than 30 minutes or any period of being dazed and confused. Moderate
TBI was considered to be any self-reported blow to the head accompanied by loss of
consciousness for between 30 minutes and 24 hours, and severe TBI was considered to be any
self-reported blow to the head accompanied by loss of consciousness for more than 24 hours. To
evaluate mechanisms of injury, we grouped mechanisms into categories of motor vehicle
accidents or being struck as a pedestrian; falling or being struck by an object; sports and

recreation; falling due to drug or alcohol blackout; being assaulted or mugged; and physical
abuse.
Hotel Study participants complete yearly or biennial MRI scans on a Philips 3.0 Tesla Achieva
scanner with an eight-channel head coil (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands). For the
present study we assessed high-resolution T1-weighted isotropic 3D IR-weighted fast-field echo
anatomic images. Specific parameters were TE = 3.5 ms, TR = 8.1 ms, flip angle = 8, FOV = 256
mm × 256 mm, acquisition matrix = 256 × 250, reconstruction matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size =
1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3, 190 contiguous slices, gap = 0, scan duration = 443 s, SENSE = 1, no
partial imaging acceleration. All scans were reviewed by certified neuroradiologists (ATV,
MKH) for clinically relevant incidental findings. We excluded scans that were incomplete or
contained significant motion artifact. In the present study we report the prevalence of lesions
seen on T1-weighted MRI scans that were deemed to be most likely traumatically-induced by
consensus of a three-member team comprised of a neuroradiologists and a qualified
neuroscientist (DJL, ATV, or MKH), a TBI neurologist (WJP) and a stroke neurologist (TSF).
Statistical analysis
We compared demographic characteristics and TBI history variables between adults and youth
using independent-samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, Chi-squared tests with Yates’
continuity corrections, or Fisher’s Exact Tests as appropriate. All other analyses were conducted
on the full sample including both adult and youth, adjusted for age. We evaluated sex differences
across mechanism of TBI using logistic regression models with the mechanism of interest as the
dependent variable, adjusting for age. To evaluate whether severity of worst lifetime TBI was
associated with the age of first loss of stable housing, we used multiple linear regression models
to evaluate whether history of TBI (no TBI, only mild TBI, or moderate or severe TBI) was
associated with the age at first homelessness or precarious housing, adjusted for sex. To assess
whether moderate or severe TBI was more closely associated with the initial loss of stable
housing, we used multiple linear regression models to compare the mean number of years
between the first most severe TBI (i.e. the first mild TBI in those whose worst TBI was mild, or
the first moderate or severe TBI in those whose worst TBI was moderate or severe) and the first

experience of homelessness and precarious housing, adjusted for age and sex. Finally, we
evaluated whether fewer number of years between the first TBI and the first experience of
homelessness or precarious housing was associated with a longer lifetime duration of
homelessness or precarious housing using negative binomial regression, adjusted for age and sex.
Exponentiating coefficients from the negative binomial regression resulted in rate ratios and their
95% confidence intervals. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.0.27
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics
Our study sample consisted of 285 participants (adult sample n=226; youth sample n=59) who
had completed the BISQ, and demographic and psychiatric diagnoses are reported in Table 1.
The adult sample was significantly older and had experienced a longer lifetime duration in
precarious housing than the youth sample. When evaluated as a rate (lifetime duration divided by
age) the youth sample had experienced a greater proportion of their lifetime spent in
homelessness (U=5044.5, p=0.005). Those in the youth sample became homeless and
precariously housed at a significantly younger age than those in the adult sample. At entry into
the study, the youth sample had a higher prevalence of psychotic disorders, methamphetamine
dependence, and cannabis dependence than the adult sample, while the adult sample had a higher
prevalence of opioid and cocaine dependence than the youth sample.

Eighty two percent of the study sample reported at least one lifetime TBI, and the proportion of
adults and youth who endorsed a history of TBI was not significantly different. Sixty-four
percent of participants reported more than one TBI in their lifetime and 59.6% of participants
reported a TBI that resulted in loss of consciousness. The median number of lifetime TBI
(median=3) did not differ between the adults and youth. In contrast, when analyzed as a rate
(number of TBI per year), the youth sample reported a significantly higher number of TBI per
year (U=8193.5, p=0.007). In this sample, 21.8% reported a moderate or severe TBI, with a
higher, though not statistically significant, prevalence in the adult sample than the youth sample.
Individuals whose worst TBI was moderate or severe also reported a higher number of lifetime
TBIs (U=3933, p=0.002). All participants who had T1-weighted MRI evidence of prior TBI

(10.1%) were in the adult sample. In total, 26.7% of all participants in this sample reported either
a history of moderate or severe TBI, or had evidence of TBI visible on neuroimaging.
There were no significant differences in mechanism of TBI between the adult and youth sample,
and thus, the mechanisms by which participants in the full sample received one or multiple TBIs
is shown in Figure 1. Being assaulted or mugged and falling were the most commonly reported
mechanisms of injury. There was a trend towards a higher proportion of males reporting more
TBI through being assaulted or mugged than females (adjusted OR=1.13, 95% CI=0.99–1.31,
p=0.070). Females reported significantly more TBIs through physical abuse as compared to
males (Figure 1 inset; adjusted OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.14–1.39, p=9.18e-06).

‘MVA or pedestrian struck’, and ‘Sports and recreation’ categories encompass multiple discrete
mechanisms on the BISQ.
Relationship between severity of TBI and losing stable housing
To evaluate whether history or severity of TBI was associated with earlier loss of stable housing,
we compared the mean age of first homelessness or precarious housing between those with no
history of TBI, those whose worst TBI was mild, and those whose worst TBI was moderate or

severe. Age at first homelessness and precarious housing stratified by the severity of worst TBI
is shown in Figure 2a-b. Neither a history of mild TBI (b=-0.89, p=0.853) nor a history of
moderate or severe TBI (b=-0.53, p=0.794) were associated with an earlier age at first
homelessness, as compared to those who did not report TBI, adjusted for age and sex. Findings
were similar for age at first precarious housing (no TBI=reference; mild TBI: b=-2.15, p=0.146;
moderate or severe TBI: b=-2.03, p=0.245), adjusted for age and sex.

We then evaluated the time interval between the participants’ most severe TBI and the onset of
homelessness or precarious housing, adjusted for age. The distributions of the number of years
between the first most severe TBI and the onset of homelessness and precarious housing are
shown in Figure 3a-b. For adults with a history of only mild TBI, the median number of years
between the first mild TBI and the first experience of homelessness was 13 years and for
precarious housing was 17.5 years. For adults whose worst TBI was moderate or severe, the
median number of years between their first moderate or severe TBI and the first experience of
homelessness was zero years (i.e., the first moderate or severe TBI occurred in the same year as
the first experience of homelessness) and for precarious housing was eight years.
Findings were similar in the youth sample: In youths with a history of only mild TBI, the median
number of years between the first mild TBI and the first experience of homelessness was 6.5
years and for precarious housing was 10.5 years. In youths with a history of moderate or severe
TBI, the median number of years between the first moderate or severe TBI and the first
experience of homelessness was 0.5 years and for precarious housing was 3 years. In the full
sample, the first moderate or severe TBI occurred significantly closer to the year of first
homelessness (b=2.79, p=0.003), adjusting for age and sex. Similarly, we found that the first
moderate or severe TBI occurred significantly closer to the year of first precarious housing
(b=2.69, p=7.47e-4), adjusting for age and sex.

Relationship between the timing of TBI and remaining homeless or precariously housed
Finally, we used negative binomial regression to evaluate whether TBI closer to the initial loss of
stable housing was associated with a longer lifetime duration of homelessness or precarious
housing. In this sample, 58.2% of participants reported that they received their first TBI prior to
first becoming homeless, and 74.0% reported that the received their first TBI prior to becoming

precariously housed. Traumatic brain injury closer to the first experience of homelessness was
significantly associated with a longer lifetime duration of homelessness, adjusting for age and
sex (RR=1.04, 95% CI=1.02–1.06, p=6.8e-6). Thus, for every additional year closer to becoming
homeless that participants received their first TBI, there was a mean increase of 4% in their
lifetime duration of homelessness. The results were similar for the relationship between the first
TBI and the first experience of precarious housing (RR=1.03, 95% CI=1.01–1.04, p=5.5e-10),
adjusted for age and sex.
DISCUSSION
In this sample of precariously housed adults and youth, 82.1% reported a lifetime history of TBI
and 21.7% reported a history of moderate or severe TBI. One previous meta-analysis (n=25,134)
found that 12% of the general population reported a lifetime history of TBI.28 A more recent
state-wide survey (in Ohio, USA; n=6,998) estimated that 21.7% of the general population had at
least one TBI with loss of consciousness and 2.6% had experienced at least one moderate or
severe TBI.29 In comparison, the lifetime prevalence of TBI in this precariously housed sample is
3.8–6.8 times that of the general population. Additionally, the lifetime prevalence of moderate or
severe TBI in this population is nearly 10 times that of estimates in the general population.
Notably, 8.2% of participants in this sample (adults and youth combined) had evidence of trauma
visible on T1-weighted MRI scans.
Homeless and precariously housed youth in this study reported a disproportionately high burden
of TBI; those in the youth sample sustained their first TBI at a significantly younger age and
sustained more TBIs per year as compared with the adult sample. Both adults and youth
generally reported that their first TBI occurred early in life. While the ages at first TBI and first
moderate or severe TBI in the adult sample were similar to those reported in the general
population,30 the ages at first TBI in the youth sample were lower than those in the general
population. Traumatic brain injury in the critical developmental period of adolescence is a risk
factor for the development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, and other
organic mental illnesses.31 While we did not evaluate TBI as a risk factor for the onset of
diagnosed psychiatric illness, there was a high prevalence of both TBI and diagnosed psychiatric

illness in this sample. Future studies should evaluate the impact of TBI in exacerbating existing
psychiatric illness in vulnerable populations. Traumatic brain injury is also associated – in a
dose-response relationship – with higher risk for low educational attainment, receiving disability
pension, and welfare recipiency in adulthood.30 Thus, TBI may be an important factor in the
broad range of challenges faced by homeless and precariously housed populations.
The most commonly reported mechanism of injury in this sample was assault, corroborating
previous studies that evaluated mechanism of injury in this population.12; 16; 32; 33 Conversely, in
the general population, sustaining TBI through assault is not a predominant cause of TBI causing
hospitalization.34 Females had a significantly higher odds of sustaining TBI through physical
abuse, an important and actionable finding that parallels recent studies that have evaluated TBI
in individuals who are survivors of intimate partner violence.35
Our findings also highlight notable associations between the severity and timing of TBI with
housing status. First, moderate or severe TBI was closely related to the initial loss of stable
housing, which suggests that a considerable proportion of newly homeless and precariously
housed individuals may be acutely experiencing sequelae related to TBI. Second, TBI closer to
the initial loss of losing stable housing was associated with a longer duration of homelessness
and precarious housing, further suggesting that sequelae of TBI may be an important mediator of
functional capacity in those who have transitioned to homelessness, and may create additional
barriers to exiting homelessness. Importantly, the relationship between TBI and homelessness is
likely bidirectional given that homelessness is itself associated with a greater risk of incident
TBIs, whether through an increase in violent encounters, substance abuse, or other factors.13; 36
This study has several strengths and limitations. First, we assessed lifetime TBI using the BISQ,
which is a screening tool designed specifically to characterize lifetime TBI, and validated in
similar populations.25 Many previous studies that have assessed TBI in homeless and
precariously housed populations have used only a single question (i.e. ‘Have you ever
experienced a blow to the head…’) to ascertain TBI history, yet, single-item screening questions
for head injury have been shown to considerably underestimate the prevalence estimated by
more comprehensive methods.37; 38 Thus, our estimate of lifetime prevalence may be a more

representative estimate of the true lifetime prevalence of TBI in this population. However, TBI
history was still largely assessed through participant self-report. Relying on self-reported loss of
consciousness is a necessary but potentially unreliable method of retrospectively determining
TBI severity.39 Additionally, we were not able to identify the specific year of every injury after
the first TBI, which precluded a more detailed analysis. Finally, participants with significant
comorbid substance use disorders or economic disadvantage may be missed or lost to follow-up
in longitudinal studies.40; 41 While the Hotel Study is focused specifically on this vulnerable
population, the study necessitates coordinating and attending follow-up visits, and thus we may
have inadvertently missed individuals who had the most severe manifestations of psychiatric
illness (and possibly those with a higher lifetime burden of TBI).
We found that a majority of homeless and precariously housed individuals reported a lifetime
history of TBI, and more than one-fifth reported a history of moderate or severe TBI. Youth in
this sample experienced a disproportionately high burden of TBI, including more TBIs per year
and a younger first age at initial TBI. Injuries for both adults and youth were most commonly
sustained through assaults and falls, though females were more vulnerable to sustaining TBI
through physical abuse. We showed that moderate or severe TBIs generally occurred closer to
the initial loss of stable housing, and that sustaining TBI closer to the initial loss of stable
housing was associated with a longer lifetime duration of both homelessness and precarious
housing. Notably, in both our analyses of severity and temporality, we found comparable results
for homelessness and precarious housing. This highlights the notion that despite being ‘housed’,
individuals living in precarious housing share largely similar characteristics and consequences as
homeless individuals. Future research that uses standardized assessment methods in prospective
study designs is needed to better understand the full scope of the impact of TBI in this
population.
