ABSTRACT
Transthyretin (TTR) gene has a causal role in a hereditary form of amyloidosis (ATTRm) and
is potentially involved in the risk of senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). To understand the
genetics of ATTRm and SSA, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of TTR gene
in 361,194 participants of European descent testing coding and non-coding variants. Among
the 382 clinically-relevant phenotypes tested, TTR non-coding variants were associated with
26 phenotypic traits after multiple testing correction. These included signs related to both
ATTRm and SSA such as chronic ischaemic heart disease (rs140226130, p=2.00×10-6), heart
failure (rs73956431, p=2.74×10-6), atrial fibrillation (rs10163755, p=4.63×10-6), dysphagia
(rs2949506, p=3.95×10-6), intestine diseases (rs970866, p=7.14×10-6) and anxiety
(rs554521234, p=8.85×10-6). Consistent results were observed for TTR disease-causing
mutation Val122Ile (rs76992529) with respect to carpal tunnel syndrome (p=6.41×10-6) and
mononeuropathies of upper limbs (p=1.22×10-5). Sex differences were also observed in line
with ATTRm and SSA epidemiology. Additionally, we explored possible modifier genes
related to TTR function, observing convergent associations of RBP4 variants with the clinical
phenotypes associated with TTR locus. In conclusion, we provide novel insights regarding the
molecular basis of ATTRm and SSA based on large-scale cohort, expanding our
understanding of the phenotypic spectrum associated with TTR gene variation.

INTRODUCTION
Transthyretin (TTR) misfolding and the consequent amyloid formation and deposition lead to
two form of amyloidoses: a hereditary (or mutant) form (ATTRm) caused by more than 100
TTR gene coding mutations [1], and a senile systemic form (SSA) that is due to the
misfolding of wild type protein (i.e., no TTR coding mutation present in the individuals [2].
ATTRm is a life-threating disorder that affects several tissues (e.g. brain, autonomic and
peripheral nerves, heart, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract) and is characterized by an extreme
heterogeneity in the genotype-phenotype correlation, including the age of onset, the
penetrance, and the clinical display [3-6]. Despite TTR coding mutations are the cause of the
disease, the clinical variability of the ATTRm is likely due to several other factors [7-11].
Differently from ATTRm, patients affected by SSA do not present a coding mutation in TTR
gene and the main symptoms include cardiac failure and carpal tunnel syndrome[12-16]. TTR
non-coding variation via its regulatory function seems to have a role in the phenotypic
heterogeneity of ATTRm and to play a role in the pathogenesis of SSA [11,17-19].
Furthermore, variation in other genes encoding for protein products that interact with TTR
tetramer seems to modulate the pathogenetic processes involved in the TTR fibrils formation
and, consequently, in the course of the disease [20-22]. Genome-wide datasets generated
from cohorts including hundred thousand participants can be leveraged to disentangle
complex genotype-phenotype associations. In particular, phenome-wide association studies
(PheWAS) can permit us to detect novel associations with respect to known risk loci with
respect to a wide range of phenotypes [23-25]. In the present study, we explored the
phenotypic spectrum associated with the coding and non-coding variants of TTR gene, also
investigating potential modifier loci that could modulate TTR amyloidogenic process. To
date, the vast of majority of the studies that investigated the genetics of ATTRm and SSA
have been conducted on cohorts with a limited sample size due to the low disease prevalence

[9,11,19]. ATTRm and SSA signs are poorly recognized and the correct diagnosis in sporadic
cases is usually established several years from the onset of the symptoms [26]. This
consistently limited the ability to collect large informative cohorts needed to investigate the
genetics of ATTRm and SSA. To date, it is possible to investigate cohorts including hundred
thousand participants to explore the association of genetic variation with clinically relevant
phenotypes. Accordingly, we conducted a PheWAS in 361,194 participants of European
descent available from the UK Biobank with respect to 382 clinically relevant traits to
investigate genetic variation potentially involved in TTR-related pathogenic processes. The
results obtained support that non-coding variants located in TTR gene and other diseasemodifying loci are associated with phenotypic traits related to ATTRm and SSA. On the basis
of the basis of the current findings, we hypothesize that non-coding variation is involved i) in
the variability of genotype-phenotype correlation of carriers of TTR coding mutations; and ii)
in the increased risk of SSA in non-carriers of TTR coding mutations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genome-wide datasets
The dataset used for the analysis was derived from the UK Biobank. This is an open access
resource available to investigate a wide range of serious and life-threatening illnesses [27].
This project has recruited more than 500,000 people assessed for a wide range of phenotypic
information, also including clinically-relevant phenotypes. Complete genome-wide data are
available for the whole cohort. These genetic data were used to generate genome-wide
association datasets that can be used to explore the genetics of human diseases and traits.
These genome-wide datasets used in the present study were generated on the analysis of
361,194 participants of European descent including 194,174 women and 167,020 men. The

association analysis for all phenotypes was conducted using a linear regression model
available in Hail (available at https://github.com/hail-is/hail) including the first 20 ancestry
principal components, sex, age, age2, sex×age, and sex×age2 as covariates. Details regarding
QC criteria, GWAS methods, and the original data are available at
https://github.com/Nealelab/UK_Biobank_GWAS/tree/master/imputed-v2-gwas.

Clinically-relevant Phenotypes
Since our goal was to investigate phenotypes related to the pathogenesis of ATTRm and
SSA, we focused on clinically-relevant traits available in the UK Biobank. Specifically, we
considered ICD-10 (International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision; [28,29]) codes and
clinical endpoints derived by the FinnGen project [https://www.finngen.fi/en]. ICD-10 codes
are a specific terminology that include diseases, signs, symptoms, and procedure codes
maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), and they typically are used to billing
data [28]. The FinnGen project comes from a collaboration among Finnish universities,
biobanks, hospital districts, and several international pharmaceutical companies to increase
knowledge about the origins of diseases. FinnGen clinical endpoints (available at
https://www.finngen.fi/en/researchers/clinical-endpoints) were developed to conduct
genome-wide investigations of phenotypic traits assessed across several national health
registers. To remove phenotypes not informative due to a lack of statistical power, we
investigated phenotypic traits with a number of cases greater than 1000 individuals. The full
list of the phenotypes investigated and their corresponding sample size is reported in the
Table S1. Additionally, we also conducted sex-stratified analysis to investigate the known
differences between sexes in the epidemiology of ATTRm and SSA. A total of 382, 240, and

225 clinically-relevant phenotypes were investigated in the total sample and in the sexstratified analysis (female- and male-specific analyses, respectively).

Data Analysis
We considered a total of 382 clinically-relevant phenotypes (sex-stratified analysis: 240 for
female-specific PheWAS and 225 for male-specific PheWAS) and investigated variability of
TTR gene considering a 4-Mb region (NC_000018.9: 27,171,000–31,171,500) including the
genic locus (NM_000371; 7,257 bp) and the surrounding regions (± ~2Mb from the
transcription start/end sites) (Table 1). We only considered variants with a minor allele
frequency (MAF) greater than 1%. As recommended in the original UK Biobank analysis
(information available at http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/11/details-and-considerationsof-the-uk-biobank-gwas), we considered high-confidence association results generated from
variants with at least 25 minor alleles in the smaller group (case or control). A total of 12,719,
12,710, and 12,711 high-confidence TTR variants were investigated in the overall-sample and
in the sex-stratified analyses (male- and female-specific, respectively). False Discovery Rate
(FDR) at 10% was applied as significance threshold for multiple testing correction [30]
accounting for the number of variants and the number of traits tested. To estimate the
independent association signals within the genomic region tested, PLINK 1.09 [31] was used
to perform linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping considering a 0.1 R2 cut-off within a 500kb window.

STRING v.11.0 [32] was used to identify protein interaction with TTR, considering
experiments, co-expression, co-occurrence, gene fusion, and neighbourhood as active sources
and a confidence score higher than 0.9. With respect to proteins identified, we investigated

variants included in coding, non-coding, and surrounding regions of the encoding gene using
the same quality control criteria applied in the analysis of TTR variants. Additionally, we
investigated the functional enrichments association related to the protein-protein interactions
identified considering Gene Ontologies [33,34] for biological processes and molecular
functions and molecular pathways available in the Reactome Database [35].

RESULTS
The TTR PheWAS identified several phenotypic associations surviving FDR multiple testing
correction (Figure 1). These include associations identified in the overall analysis and in the
sex-stratified analyses (Figure 2, Table S2). In the analysis of the total cohort (Table S3), we
observed several clinical signs that may be related to ATTRm and SSA: spinal stenosis
(FinnGen: M13_SPINSTENOSIS; rs116937108, beta=0.002, p=1.21x10-7), neuromuscular
dysfunction of bladder (ICD-10: N31; rs9953311, beta=-0.001, p=2.30×10-6; rs575854233,
beta=-0.001, p=5.33×10-6), and anxiety disorders (FINNGEN: KRA_PSY_ANXIETY;
rs554521234, beta = 0.003, p=8.85×10-6). Additionally, we also observed significant findings
not expected to be directly related to TTR amyloidogenic process: Barret’s esophagus
(FinnGen: K11_BARRET; rs147570462, beta=0.003, p=1.19x10-7), abscess of anal and
rectal regions (ICD-10: K61; rs72948149, beta=0.002, p=1.87×10-6); fissure and fistula of
anal and rectal regions (ICD-10: K60; rs72927361, beta=-0.003, p=1.90×10-6); complications
of other internal prosthetic devices, implants and grafts (ICD-10: T85; rs34444556,
beta=0.003, p=5.5x10-6), ulcer of esophagus (FinnGen: K11_OESULC; rs74481699,
beta=0.004,p=6.43x10-6), adjustment and management of implanted device (ICD-10: Z45;
rs117672477, beta=0.002, p=6.51x10-6); primary lymphoid and hematopoietic malignant
neoplasms (FinnGen: C3_PRIMARY_LYMPHOID_HEMATOPOIETIC; rs17718949,

beta=0.01, p=6.57x10-6). Among the 240 clinically-relevant phenotypes tested in the femalespecific analysis (N = 194,174), we identified 8 LD-independent variants associated with
specific pathological conditions (Table S4): chronic ischaemic heart disease (ICD-10: I25;
rs140226130, beta=0.003, p=2.00×10-6), dysphagia (ICD-10: R13; rs2949506, beta=0.002,
p=3.95x10-6), other disorders of urinary system (ICD-10: N39; rs71173870, beta=0.003,
p=9.81×10-6), other specified/unspecified soft tissue disorders (ICD-10:
M13_SOFTTISSUENAS; rs558461933, beta=0.007, p=9.92x10-6), other cataract (ICD-10:
H26; rs12966815, beta=0.003, p=1.10×10-5), retinal detachments and breaks (ICD-10: H33;
rs117637258, beta=0.003, p = 1.12×10-5), other abnormal products of conception (ICD-10:
O02; rs139327590, beta=0.004, p=1.16x10-5), and shoulder lesions (ICD-10: M75;
rs77728273, beta=-0.004, p=1.21x10-5). Several of these clinical manifestations (e.g.,
I25~Chronic ischaemic heart disease, R13~Dysphagia, N39~Other disorders of urinary
system, H26~Other cataract and H33~Retinal detachments and breaks) seem to be closely
related to the expected symptoms of ATTRm and SSA. The male-specific PheWAS (225
phenotypic traits tested) revealed several significant associations that could be related to
cardiac, gastrointestinal, and urinary symptoms of ATTRm and SSA (Table S5): other
disorders of bladder (ICD-10: N32; rs138038371, beta=0.009, p=5.01×10-7), heart failure
(FinnGen: I9_HEARTFAIL; rs73956431, beta=0.005, p=2.74×10-6), malignant neoplasm of
colon (ICD-10: C18; rs78431500, beta=0.006, p=2.89x10-6), Barret’s esophagus (ICD-10:
K11_BARRET; rs147570462, beta=0.005, p=3.45x10-6), atrial fibrillation and flutter (ICD10: I48; rs10163755, beta=0.003, p=4.63×10-6), calculus of kidney and ureter (ICD-10: N20;
rs8090264, beta=0.002, p=5.23×10-6), complications of procedures not elsewhere classified
(ICD-10: T81; rs182526571, beta=0.008, p=6.57x10-6), other diseases of intestine (ICD-10:

Amyloidogenic coding variants in TTR gene are the established cause of ATTRm [1,5,6]. The
large sample size of the UK Biobank cohort includes carriers of TTR amyloidogenic
mutations with high-quality genotype information (imputation info score > 0.8; Table S6).
However, due to the very low MAF of these coding mutations, the phenotypic associations of
these variants should be considered only a “low-confidence” result as described in the
methods. Being aware of this limitation, we explored their phenotypic spectrum in the UK
Biobank (Table 2). The most relevant results were observed for the TTR Val122Ile mutation
(rs76992529) in the female participants with respect to two well-known symptoms of the
amyloidogenic process: carpal tunnel syndrome (FinnGen: G6_CARPTU; beta=0.307,
p=6.41×10-6) and mononeuropathies of upper limb (ICD-10: G56; beta=0.306, p=1.22×10-5).

To test the presence of modifier genes involved in TTR-related pathogenic processes, we
investigated potential protein interaction and observed the highest-confidence interaction
with respect to RBP4 protein, which is is supported by experiments and co-expression
interaction sources (STRING interaction score = 0.914). The TTR-RBP4 protein interaction
is associated with functional enrichments for GO terms, including retinol metabolic process
(GO:0042572, FDR q=6.3×10-4) and protein heterodimerization activity (GO:0046982, FDR
q=0.02), and for Reactome molecular pathways, including retinol cycle disease events (HSA2453864, FDR q=9.98×10-6), canonical retinoid cycle in rods (HSA-2453902, FDR
q=1.1×10-5), and retinoid metabolism and transport (HSA-975634, FDR q=2.84×10-5). On the
basis of these data, we hypothesize a convergence where variants located in TTR and RBP4
genes are associated with clinically-relevant phenotypes related to ATTRm and SSA
pathogenesis. Accordingly, we investigated 13,226, 13,231, and 13217 high-confidence

variants (overall-sample, female-specific, and male-specific analyses, respectively) located in
RBP4 gene and its surrounding regions (NC_000010.10: 93,353,000 – 97,353,500) with
respect to the significant phenotypic traits observed in the TTR PheWAS (Table 1). We
identified significant associations in the overall cohort and in the sex-stratified analyses
(Table S2). In the overall sample, we confirmed some of the TTR associations previously
observed with respect to TTR gene that are related to known clinical signs of ATTRm and
SSA (Table S7): heart failure (FinnGen: I9_HEARTFAIL; rs1326222, beta=0.001,
p=5.25×10-7) and anxiety disorders (FinnGen: KRA_PSY_ANXIETY; rs112059561,
beta=0.002, p=6.44×10-6). Among the phenotypes that do not seem to be related to TTR
amyloidogenic processes, Barret’s esophagus was also significantly associated with a RBP4
variant (FinnGen: K11_BARRET; rs12573026, beta=0.001, p=9.96×10-8). In the femalespecific analysis, we observed significant associations with respect to cardiac symptoms
which are one of the leading sigsn of ATTRm and SSA: atrial fibrillation and flutter (ICD-10:
I48; rs4917692, beta=0.002, p=1.15×10-5) and heart failure (FinnGen: I9_HEARTFAIL;
rs1326222, beta=0.001, p=1.23×10-5) (Table S8). Finally, in the male participants, we
observed a convergence between RBP4 and TTR findings with respect to two additional
phenotypes expected to be related to ATTRm and SSA (FinnGen:
M13_SPINSTENOSIS~spinal stenosis, rs112288944, beta=0.005, p=1.42×10-5; ICD-10:
R13~Dysphagia, rs61886346, beta=0.003, p=1.66×10-5). Some conditions that are not
expected to be linked to amyloidogenic processes such as Barret’s esophagus (FinnGen:
K11_BARRET; rs12573026, beta=0.002, p=1.01×10-7) and malignant neoplasm of colon
(ICD-10: C18; rs142083973, beta=0.005, p=3.40×10-6) were also associated with both RBP4
and TTR gene variants in the male sample (Table S9). Table S10 summarizes all significant
associations, providing the allele frequencies of TTR and RBP4 variants identified.

DISCUSSION
TTR misfolding and the following amyloid formation and deposition are the cause of
ATTRm and SSA due to TTR coding variants and the misfolding of the wild type protein,
respectively [1,2]. With respect to ATTRm, several studies investigated the role of TTR
coding and non-coding variation to dissect the molecular machineries at the basis of its
complex phenotype-genotype correlation [8-11, 17,18, 19]. Differently, limited information is
available regarding the genetic basis of SSA [19]. PheWAS design is a powerful tool to
broaden the knowledge about the phenotypic spectrum associated with disease-causing
genetic variations [23-25] and its performance is enhanced by the availability of genomic
data of large cohorts. Accordingly, we conducted a phenome-wide investigation of TTR
coding and non-coding variants in more than 300,000 participants of European descent, also
evaluating the RBP4 gene as a possible modifier of TTR pathogenetic mechanisms.

Our results pointed out novel associations of TTR non-coding variants with phenotypic
conditions potentially related to ATTRm and SSA pathogenesis. In the sex stratified analysis,
we observed strong evidence of the effect of TTR non-coding variations on cardiac
involvement (ICD-10: I25~Chronic ischaemic heart disease; I48~Atrial fibrillation and
flutter; FinnGen: I9_HEARTFAIL~Heart failure, strict), one of the leading clinical signs of
ATTRm and SSA. With respect to SSA, heart is the most affected organ in elderly patients,
and, the main manifestations are cardiomyopathy (resulting in increase of biventricular wall
thickness and ventricular stiffness) and atrial fibrillation [26,36]. The symptoms associated
with ATTRm include a restrictive amyloid cardiomyopathy along with a combination of

several other signs, including gait, gastrointestinal, neurological, urinary/renal, and ocular
involvement frequently reported among the affected carriers [1,6,26,36].

GI symptoms were identified in our phenome-wide investigation (ICD-10: R13~Dysphagia
and K63~Other diseases of intestine). The occurrence of GI manifestations has been reported
in both ATTRm and SSA and these include nausea, vomiting, constipation, faecal
incontinence, and weight loss [26,37,38]. Although GI involvement is reported in SSA
patients, these symptoms are less common than the ones reported in ATTRm [38], where GI
manifestations are more frequent in early-onset patients [38].

Significant associations of TTR variants with respect to bladder, urinary tract and kidney were
identified in the overall sample and in the sex-stratified analyses (ICD-10:
N31~Neuromuscular dysfunction of bladder, not elsewhere classified; N39~Other disorders
of urinary system; N32~Other disorders of bladder; N20~Calculus of kidney and ureter). It is
well known the evolution of neurogenic bladder in ATTRm that is linked to autonomic nerve
dysfunction, and, renal involvement due to the amyloid deposition in the glomeruli arterioles
and medium vessels [26,39].

The female sample showed that TTR non-coding variants are associated with ocular
involvement (ICD-10: H26~Other cataract; H33~Retinal detachments and breaks). These
findings are consistent with the known ocular manifestations described in ATTRm, which, in
agreement with our sex-stratified result, occur more frequently in women [40]. The ocular
symptoms reported in ATTRm patients include vitreous opacities, retinal vein occlusion and
direct optic nerve infiltration[40].

Remarkably, a significant genetic association between TTR gene and anxiety disorders
(FinnGen: KRA_PSY_ANXIETY) was observed. There is a growing literature regarding the
effect of rare life-threatening diseases on the mental health of the patients and their families.
With respect to ATTRm, several studies reported considerable psychological consequences in
carriers of TTR mutations after the onset of the symptoms and the diagnosis of the disease
[41,42]. These behavioural changes seem to be related to the stressful scenarios related to
amyloidosis diagnostic path, including the pre-symptomatic genetic testing confirming the
presence of an amyloidogenic mutation in family members and the time (usually years)
intervening between the onset of the symptoms and the diagnosis of the diseases in novel
ATTRm cases.

Spinal stenosis (FinnGen: M13_SPINSTENOSIS) was another phenotype identified in our
TTR Phewas. This symptom has been reported in both ATTRm and SSA patients [26,36], and
it usually co-occurs with other known signs of TTR amyloidogenic process such as carpal
tunnel syndrome and neuropathies [43]. These phenotypic traits were identified as associated
to TTR Val122Ile mutation (Table 2). This is also consistent with phenotypic presentation of
Val122Ile carriers affected by ATTRm where the carpal tunnel syndrome represents an early
sign of the disease whereas upper limb involvement is a clinical manifestation observed in a
later stage [26]. Although our findings are related to carriers of European descent and
Val122Ile mutation is mainly identified in individuals of African descent, a similar clinical
phenotype has been reported in Val122Ile carriers of both ancestry groups [44].

Our findings support a phenotypic convergence between TTR and RBP4 genetic associations,
also including traits expected to be associated with ATTRm and SSA clinical spectrum (i.e.,
heart failure and atrial fibrillation). This evidence supports the putative role of RBP4 as
modifier gene with respect to TTR amyloidogenic process. RBP4 interacts with TTR via
formation of TTR-RBP4 protein complex that stabilizes the TTR tetramer, inhibiting
monomer dissociation and fibril formation [3]. In carriers of TTR amyloidogenic mutations,
there is an increase of the TTR tetramer dissociation with a consequent decrease of the TTRRBP4 complex and an increase of the RBP4 urinary excretion [3,45]. Accordingly, RBP4
genetic variation could affect the functionality of the TTR-RBP4 complex, contributing to the
complex phenotype-genotype correlation in carriers of TTR amyloidogenic mutations and
increasing the risk of SSA in non-carriers.

Both TTR and RBP4 association analyses identified traits that are not expected to be related
to the pathological consequences of the amyloidogenic process. However, they may be
related to the inter-individual variability of the main physiological function of these two
genes: the transport of retinol (vitamin A) [46]. Altered homeostasis of vitamin is associated
with several disorders [47] and some of them could be associated with the effect of TTR and
RBP4 variants on retinol metabolism, explaining some of the phenotypic traits identified in
the present study.

In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights about TTR gene variation, confirming
its role in phenotypic variability observed in ATTRm patients and supporting its potential
involvement in the predisposition to SSA. These data support the relevance of large biobanks
to investigate complex genotype-phenotype associations. Additionally, the insights provided

support the necessity of further investigations of TTR non-coding variation together with
putative modifier loci to develop tools able to anticipate the course of the disease in order to
improve the diagnosis and management of patients affected by ATTRm and SSA.
