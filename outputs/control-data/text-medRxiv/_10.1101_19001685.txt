21

Context: Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have decreased growth hormone

22

(GH), which can increase visceral adiposity (VAT) and impair vascular function. GH releasing

23

hormone, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) substrate, stimulates GH secretion.

24

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition increases GH and improves glucose

25

levels and vascular function in women with PCOS.

26

Methods: Eighteen women with PCOS participated in a double-blinded, cross-over study. They

27

received sitagliptin 100 mg vs. placebo daily for one month separated by an eight-week

28

washout. During each treatment, women underwent a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test

29

(OGTT), assessment of vascular function and body composition. Overnight GH secretion was

30

assessed via venous sampling every 10 minutes for 12 hours and analyzed using an automated

31

deconvolution algorithm.

32

Results: During OGTT, sitagliptin increased GLP-1 (p<0.001), early insulin secretion (from

33

mean insulinogenic index 1.9±1.2 (SD) to 3.2±3.1; p=0.02) and decreased peak glucose (mean

34

-17.2 mg/dL [95% CI -27.7, -6.6]; p<0.01). At one month, sitagliptin decreased VAT (from

35

1141.9±700.7 to 1055.1±710.1 g; p=0.02) but did not affect vascular function.

36

increased GH half-life (from 13.9±3.6 to 17.0±6.8 min, N=16; p=0.04) and interpulse interval

37

(from 53.2±20.0 to 77.3±38.2 min, N=16; p<0.05) but did not increase mean overnight GH

38

(p=0.92 vs. placebo).

39

Conclusions: Sitagliptin decreased the maximal glucose response to OGTT and VAT.

40

Sitagliptin did not increase overnight GH but increased GH half-life and the interpulse interval.

Sitagliptin

41
42

Precis: Sitagliptin improved body composition and blood glucoses following oral glucose load in

43

women with PCOS. Sitagliptin potentiated GH half-life but did not increase overnight GH levels.

Introduction

45

Growth hormone (GH) is secreted in a pulsatile fashion from the pituitary gland and exerts its

46

effects either directly, via activation of the GH receptor, or indirectly, through hepatic insulin-like

47

growth factor-1 (IGF-1). In adults, GH has important effects on the vasculature and body

48

composition. GH increases endothelium-dependent vasodilator function and reduces

49

inflammation.(1-3) We have previously shown that patients with low GH have impaired conduit

50

artery vasodilator function along with decreased tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity

51

and a defective fibrinolytic response to venous occlusion.(4) Others have corroborated these

52

findings and further demonstrated that these vascular indices improve with GH replacement

53

therapy.(3,5) GH also has anabolic and lipolytic effects. Conversely, GH secretion is reduced

54

in obesity and particularly in individuals with visceral adiposity. Women with increased visceral

55

adipose tissue (VAT) demonstrate a four-fold reduction in mean GH levels as compared to

56

those without.(6) Normalization of GH secretion in patients with diminished GH affords one

57

potential mechanism to address simultaneously both VAT and cardiovascular risk.

58

Unfortunately, therapy with recombinant GH does not restore pulsatile secretion, is not subject

59

to physiologic negative feedback by IGF-1, and is limited by hyperglycemia.(7)

60
61

We propose that an alternative strategy to enhance endogenous GH secretion in humans is to

62

inhibit the degradation of endogenous GH releasing hormone (GHRH) by the dipeptidyl

63

peptidase-4 (DPP4) enzyme. GHRH is the primary stimulus for pituitary GH secretion and

64

determines GH pulsatility. Endogenous GHRH has a half-life of six minutes as it is degraded

65

and inactivated by DPP4.(8,9) Sitagliptin was the first oral DPP4 inhibitor approved by the US

66

Food and Drug Administration for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2

67

diabetes mellitus. Sitagliptin improves post-prandial hyperglycemia in a glucose-dependent

68

manner by decreasing the degradation of the incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-

69

1), and can therefore be safely given to patients without diabetes mellitus.(10) We recently

70

found that acute DPP4 inhibition with sitagliptin enhances stimulated GH secretion and free

71

IGF-1 levels in healthy, lean women. Moreover, while vasodilation and tPA activity levels

72

increased in both men and women during stimulated GH secretion, women demonstrated an

73

enhanced vascular response to increased GH.(11) The effect of chronic DPP4 inhibition on

74

pulsatile GH secretion in individuals with low GH levels has not been studied.

75
76

Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have decreased GH secretion characterized

77

by an impaired GH response to stimuli and a greater than 50% reduction in 24-hour mean GH

78

levels.(12-14) Approximately ten percent of reproductive-aged women in the United States are

79

affected by PCOS at an estimated annual cost of over four billion dollars.(15) These women are

80

often overweight and are at increased risk for future cardiovascular disease and diabetes

81

mellitus. There are currently no approved medical therapies for women with PCOS;

82

management options include weight loss or medications aimed at controlling symptoms of

83

hirsutism or oligomenorrhea, or treatment of insulin resistance.(16,17) In this study, we tested

84

the hypothesis that one month of DPP4 inhibition with sitagliptin would enhance overnight

85

pulsatile GH secretion in overweight women with PCOS and improve glucose metabolism.

86

Given the effects of GH on the vasculature, we also hypothesized that an increase in GH would

87

enhance endothelial function and fibrinolysis.

91

Eighteen women (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) with PCOS, 18 through 45 years of age completed a double-

92

blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. (See Table 1 for subject characteristics

93

and Figure 1 for participant flow diagram.) The study adhered to the principles of the

94

Declaration of Helsinki and Title 45, U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Protection of

95

Human Subjects and was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional

96

Review Board. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to initiation of study

97

procedures. A diagnosis of PCOS was confirmed when women met two out of the three 2003

98

Rotterdam criteria: oligomenorrhea (menstrual cycles occurring at intervals >35 days, or only 4-

99

9 cycles per year) or secondary amenorrhea (no cycle in 3 months if previously regular or no

100

cycle in 9 months if previous oligomenorrheic); clinical and/or laboratory evidence of

101

hyperandrogenism; previous evidence of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound examination. Other

102

common causes of hyperandrogenemia and oligomenorrhea, including hyperprolactinemia, late-

103

onset 21-hyroxylase deficiency, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism were excluded at the

104

time of screening visit.(18) Patients with a history of chronic illness, including diabetes mellitus,

105

hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic renal or hepatic insufficiency as well as a

106

history of weight loss surgery or ongoing night-shift work were excluded. Women were required

107

to discontinue oral contraceptives for eight weeks and spironolactone for thirty days prior to

108

study enrollment, if applicable. One woman took a stable dose of metformin throughout the

109

study; other drugs known to alter glucose or insulin metabolism were not permitted. Pregnancy

110

was excluded in all women of child-bearing age by serum pregnancy testing prior to study drug

111

initiation and again prior to performing dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).

112
113

Women underwent two one-month treatment periods separated by wash-out period of at least

114

eight weeks (Figure 2). Subjects were assigned to treatment order (double-blinded sitagliptin

115

100 mg p.o. qd or matching placebo) using a block randomization algorithm. On each outpatient

116

and inpatient study day, subjects reported to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC) in

117

the morning after an overnight fast. After approximately two weeks of study drug, subjects

118

underwent an extended OGTT. One hour after oral study drug (sitagliptin vs. placebo) a

119

peripheral intravenous line was placed in the antecubital fossa of the non-dominant arm.

120

Baseline venous samples and vital signs were obtained at least 60 minutes following study

121

drug. Oral glucola (75 grams) was then ingested within 10 minutes, and samples were obtained

122

over the following 270 minutes. Women were then discharged and continued daily study drug

123

at home for an additional two weeks.

124
125

On the last day of study drug, women again reported to the CRC following an overnight fast.

126

One hour after the last dose of oral study drug, vital signs, weight, and fasting venous samples

127

were obtained via peripheral stick in the non-dominant arm. Women then underwent

128

assessment of endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilation in the dominant arm (see

129

“conduit artery vascular function” below). In the afternoon, total and regional body composition

130

was determined by a certified densitometrist using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar

131

iDXA; GE Health Care, Madison, WI) with enCore software (version 13.6). Women also

132

completed the previously validated polycystic ovarian syndrome questionnaire (PCOSQ).(19-21)

133

In the evening, women underwent placement of an indwelling venous catheter and venous

134

blood was sampled for GH every ten minutes from 8 PM until 8 AM. Meal content and

135

composition were standardized across all subjects, and intake of the standardized meals was

136

matched within each woman across study arms. Snacking and exercise were not permitted in

137

the CRC. Only water intake was permitted during GH sampling.

140

Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was evaluated in a temperature-controlled room in the

141

fasting state after 15 minutes of rest in the supine position. Participants were asked to refrain

142

from exercise, alcohol, caffeine, and anti-inflammatory medications for 24 hours preceding each

143

measurement. Studies could not be coordinated with the phase of the menstrual cycle due to

144

the infrequency or absence of cycles in the majority of our volunteers. Vascular images were

145

obtained by a single ultrasound-trained technician using an L12-3 broadband linear array

146

transducer attached to a high-resolution ultrasound machine (EPIQ7C; Phillips, Bothwell, WA).

147

A longitudinal image (parallel to the artery) was acquired just proximal to the antecubital fossa of

148

the dominant arm with the transducer positioned to optimize images of the near and far wall

149

interfaces. Depth and gain settings were optimized to identify the interface between the lumen

150

and blood vessel wall. Anatomical landmarks were documented while positioning the probe, to

151

facilitate repositioning during repeated studies. A simultaneous electrocardiogram signal was

152

recorded throughout the imaging. To assess endothelium-dependent vasodilation, brachial

153

artery diameter was measured under basal conditions and during reactive hyperemia. Reactive

154

hyperemia was achieved by inflating a pneumatic cuff on the upper arm to 200 mmHg for five

155

minutes. The cuff was deflated and images of the artery were obtained continuously across the

156

cardiac cycle for 180 seconds after cuff release. Baseline velocity time integral (VTI) was

157

determined prior to cuff occlusion and hyperemic VTI was determined for ten beats post-cuff

158

release via pulse-wave spectral Doppler recordings. Following a 15-minute rest period, the

159

brachial artery was imaged again to re-establish basal conditions. Endothelium-independent

160

vasodilation was then determined by administering 0.4 mg nitroglycerin sublingually. The

161

brachial artery was imaged three minutes later for two minutes. Nitroglycerin was only

162

administered if systolic blood pressure was at least 110 mm Hg, pulse at least 60 bpm, and with

163

the participant’s consent (N=3 participants).

165

Acquisition and analysis of the DICOM-stored images was performed using software (Brachial

166

analyzer 5.0) designed for this purpose by Medical Imaging Applications LLC (Iowa City, Iowa).

167

The vessel wall-lumen interface was determined by derivative based edge detection following

168

identification of the region of interest by the blinded investigator (JKD). The selected region of

169

interest was consistent across study days for the same subject. The maximum diameter post-

170

hyperemia was obtained using previously described custom design software which

171

automatically calculates the time to peak and peak dilation.(22) This software implements the

172

method validated by Green et al. which uses a smoothing algorithm to correct for changes in the

173

brachial artery diameter during the cardiac cycle.(23) The percent change in diameter, following

174

reactive hyperemia and nitroglycerin, was then calculated as percent vasodilation=[(peak

175

diameter-baseline diameter)/baseline diameter]*100. The reactive hyperemia-induced increase

176

in VTI relative to baseline was calculated as a ratio=hyperemia VTI/baseline VTI.

177
178

Laboratory Analyses

179

All samples were obtained after the first 3 mL of blood were discarded. Blood samples were

180

collected on ice, centrifuged immediately and plasma stored at -80°C in pre-specified aliquots

181

until time of assay. All samples obtained from each subject during sitagliptin and placebo

182

treatment were simultaneously analyzed with internal controls. DPP4 activity was assayed by

183

incubating 20 µl sample in 80 µl assay buffer (0.1 M Tris at a pH of 8.0; Bachem, Torrance, CA)

184

for 30 minutes at 37°C with colorimetric substrate [2 mM L-glycyl-L-prolyl p-nitroanilide

185

hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)] for a total reaction volume of 200 µL, as

186

previously described.(24) DPP4 antigen concentration was determined by enzyme-linked

187

immunoassay (ELISA) (eBioscience; San Diego, CA). The enzyme activity was assessed by

188

measuring the increase in specific absorbance at 405 nm at 0, 15, and 30 minutes and was

189

expressed as nmol/mL/min. Percent DPP4 inhibition was determined by the equation: [1-(DPP4

190

activity during sitagliptin/DPP4 activity during placebo)]*100. GH levels were determined by

191

two-site immunoassay (Beckman Access Ultrasensitive human GH assay, Beckman Coulter,

192

Inc.) performed on the Dxl automated immunoassay system (Beckman Instruments; Chaska

193

MN) and calibrated against NIBSC WHO IS 98/574 with an analytic measurement range of

194

0.002 to 35 ng/mL. The first five subjects were analyzed at Brigham Research Assay Core

195

(Boston, MA); the intra-assay CV was 1.48-11.26% and the inter-assay CV was 1.96-14.4%.

196

The remaining subjects were analyzed at the Mayo Immunochemical Core Lab (Rochester,

197

MN); the intra-assay CV was 3.5% at 2.50 ng/mL and 3.2% at 14.8 ng/mL. The inter-assay

198

CV’s were 4.3% at 3.03 ng/mL, 5% at 7.23 ng/mL, and 4.8% at 13.62 ng/mL. All GH samples

199

from each subject were analyzed via batch in the same lab. Free IGF-1 was determined using a

200

commercially available ELISA (R & D systems; Minneapolis, MN) with a minimum detectable

201

range of 0.015 ng/mL, intra-assay CV 3.6-5% and inter-assay CV 10.0-11.1%. Total IGF-1 was

202

analyzed by Luminex® assay (Millipore Sigma; Burlington, MA), calibrated against the NIBSC

203

WHO IS 02/254, with an intra-assay CV <10% and intra-assay CV<15%. IGF binding protein-1

204

(IGFBP-1) and IGFBP-3 were analyzed by commercially available ELISAs (RayBiotech;

205

Norcross GA) with a minimum detectable concentration of 5 pg/mL for IGF-BP1 and 80 pg/mL

206

for IGF-BP3. Both assays report an intra-assay CV <10% and inter-assay CV <12%. tPA

207

activity and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen were measured in blood collected

208

in acidified citrate anticoagulant (TriniLIZE™ Stabilyte tubes, Tcoag; Bray Co. Wicklow, Ireland).

209

TPA activity was analyzed using an ELISA calibrated against NIBSC WHO IS 98/714 (Oxford

210

Biomedical Research, Oxford MS). PAI-1 antigen was analyzed using the TintElize PAI-1

211

antigen assay (Tcoag; Co. Wicklow, Ireland). Samples for analysis of active GLP-1, total

212

peptide YY (PYY) and PYY 3-36, and glucagon were collected in EDTA collection tubes

213

prepared with aprotinin and DPP4 inhibitor (Millipore Sigma; Burlington, MA) . Active GLP-1 was

215

Panel (Millipore Sigma; Burlington, MA) with an intra-assay CV of <10% and inter-assay CV

216

<15%. Total PYY and PYY 3-36, glucagon, and insulin were analyzed in duplicate by

217

radioimmunoassay (Millipore Sigma; Burlington, MA) with intra-assay CVs of 3.7%, 2.3%, 1.6%,

218

and 3.3%, respectively. PYY 1-36 was calculated by subtracting PYY 3-36 from Total PYY.

219

Estradiol was also analyzed by radioimmunoassay (MP Biomedicals; Santa Ana, CA) with an

220

intra-assay CV of 3.9%. Blood glucoses were determined by Accu-Chek® Inform II bedside

221

glucometer (Roche Diagnostics; Indianapolis, IN); the same glucometer was used on each

222

outpatient study day. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was determined by

223

commercially available ELISA (Hycult®Biotech; Plymouth Meeting, PA). Bioavailable

224

testosterone was calculated from testosterone measured via quantitative high-performance

225

liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ARUP® Laboratories; Salt Lake City, Utah).

226

Sex hormone binding globulin was obtained via quantitative electrochemiluminescent

227

immunoassay (ARUP® Laboratories; Salt Lake City, Utah). F2-isoprostanes were determined

228

via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry assay, as previously described.(25) Total plasma

229

cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by standard enzymatic assays. HDL cholesterol

230

was measured via the enzymatic method after precipitation of VLDL and LDL using

231

polyethylene glycol reagent. From these data LDL cholesterol was calculated using the

232

Friedewald equation. Plasma free fatty acids were analyzed with a commercially available

233

enzymatic kit (Wako Life Sciences; Richmond, VA). The insulinogenic index, quantitative insulin

234

sensitivity check index (QUICKI), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-

235

IR) and Matsuda Index were calculated as previously described. (26,27)

238

Overnight spontaneous GH secretion was assessed using an automated deconvolution

239

algorithm (AutoDecon Pulse_XP Software Package), which determines secretion events, adds

240

them to the current fit to test for statistical significance, and automatically removes any non-

241

significant events until no additional statistically significant secretion events are found.(28)

242

AutoDecon has been validated for the analysis of endogenous pulsatile GH secretion from time-

243

series data obtained via frequent venous sampling from an indwelling catheter every ten

244

minutes for twelve hours.(29,30) Initial algorithm estimates included the standard deviation of

245

the secretion events, set at one-half of the data-sampling interval (5 min), and a starting value

246

for the GH elimination half-life of 13 minutes based upon previously published data in adults

247

with BMI >25 kg/m2.(31) Initial values for basal secretion and concentration at t=0 were also

248

estimated from the secretion and concentration panels. AutoDecon then determined GH basal

249

secretion, half-life, median pulse mass and interpulse interval, number of GH peaks, and GH

250

area under the curve. Additional parameters of GH secretion including mean overnight GH

251

secretion, GH peak and nadir were determined via Microsoft Excel 2010. Missing data were

omitted from analyses.

258

continuous variable data from OGTT were summarized as mean over time (from baseline to 270

262

effect models were also used to analyze repeated measures data during the OGTT with a

263

random subject effect and with fixed effects of treatment (sitagliptin vs placebo), time and

264

treatment x time interaction. The baseline measurement was also included in each model.

265

Interaction terms were removed from the final model when the corresponding p value was >0.2.

266

Comparisons between treatments were made at each time-point using Wilcoxon signed rank

Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software v. 23.0, GraphPad Prism 5 and R 2.15.0

Sample Size Calculation

272

Sample size was calculated with Power and Sample Size Calculation (PS) Software using the

273

design for a paired t-test.(33) In a prior study mean baseline overnight GH was 0.7 ± SEM 0.2

274

μg/L versus a mean overnight GH after therapy of 1.2 ± SEM 0.3 μg/L (p<0.005) in 13

275

subjects.(31) With the enrollment of subjects in current study, we found that the standard

276

deviation (SD) of mean overnight GH was 0.51 µg/L (measurements from two periods

277

combined), well below the SD of 0.72 µg/L and 1.1 µg/L observed in the prior study used in the

278

original sample size calculation. Conservatively assuming a SD of 0.6 µg/L in each group, we

279

calculated that a sample size of 16 women provides 93.2% power to detect a difference in GH

280

means of 0.5 µg/L.

286

100 mg daily significantly decreased DPP4 activity (p<0.001 vs. placebo), as assessed on both

287

the outpatient visit days (from 21.3 ± 8.0 to 8.8 ± 5.2 nmol/mL per minute) and the inpatient visit

288

days (from 22.9 ± 6.0 to 9.9 ± 4.9 nmol/mL per minute).

289
290

Sitagliptin decreased blood glucose following ingestion of 75 grams of oral glucose, as

291

summarized as both average over time (mean difference -5.13 mg/dL, 95% CI [-10.26, 0.00];

292

p=0.05), and AUC (mean difference -1476.25 mg/dL x 120 min, 95% CI [-2472.69, -479.81];

293

p<0.01) (Figure 3A). Peak blood glucose following the oral glucose load was also lower during

294

sitagliptin treatment (mean difference -17.2 mg/dL, 95% CI [-27.7, -6.6]; p<0.01). The overall

295

effect of sitagliptin on metabolism of glucose varied with time (p<0.001). At 100 minutes, mean

296

blood glucose was 15.4 mg/dL (95% CI 8.7, 22.1; p<0.001) lower during sitagliptin treatment

297

than during placebo.

298
299

Sitagliptin also enhanced early insulin secretion, as demonstrated by an increase in the

300

insulinogenic index (from 1.9 ± 1.2 to 3.2 ± 3.1; p=0.02) and insulin AUC for the first 30 minutes

301

after glucose ingestion (mean difference 349.21 µU/mL x 30 min, 95% CI [39.3, 659.1]; p=0.05)

302

(Figure 3B). Sitagliptin did not affect peripheral insulin resistance (Matsuda), hepatic insulin

303

resistance (HOMA-IR) or insulin sensitivity (QUICKI), as determined on the day of the 75-gram

304

OGTT (Table 2). Sitagliptin did not affect fasting blood glucose (p=0.572 vs. placebo) or fasting

305

insulin levels (p=0.687 vs. placebo).

306
307

Sitagliptin increased fasting GLP-1 levels (p<0.001 vs. placebo) as well as GLP-1 levels during

308

the 75-gram OGTT, summarized as average over time (mean difference 27.01 pg/mL, 95% CI

[18.01, 36.01]; p<0.001) (Figure 4A). Sitagliptin also increased peptide YY 1-36 (mean

310

difference 14.97 pg/mL, 95% CI [2.30, 27.63]; p=0.02) and decreased peptide YY 3-36 (mean

311

difference -39.78 pg/mL, 95% CI [-51.39, -28.17]; p<0.001). (Figure 4B and C) Sitagliptin did

312

not influence the change in free fatty acid levels or glucagon levels following oral glucose

313

ingestion (data not shown).

314
315

Effect of sitagliptin on GH secretion and IGF-1 levels

316

Overnight GH secretion (GH AUC) correlated inversely with weight (placebo: rs= -0.69, p=0.003;

317

sitagliptin: rs=-0.71, p=0.002), VAT mass (placebo: rs= -0.82, p<0.001; sitagliptin: rs= -0.77,

318

p=0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (placebo: rs= -0.53, p=0.035; sitagliptin: rs= -0.54,

319

p=0.031), and HOMA-IR (placebo: rs= -0.54, p=0.033; sitagliptin: rs=-0.79, p=0.001), regardless

320

of drug treatment during the preceding month.

321
322

GH levels were appropriately suppressed following oral glucose ingestion and then increased

323

approximately 4 hours later. Sitagliptin did not significantly influence the late GH peak (mean

324

difference 0.31 ng/mL, 95% CI [-0.92, 1.54]; p=0.61) during the 75-gram OGTT. IGFBP-1

325

levels, summarized as average of time, were not affected by sitagliptin (mean difference -9.18

326

pg/mL, 95% CI [-104.73, 86.38]; p=0.84). Free IGF-1 levels also were unaffected by sitagliptin

327

(mean difference -0.01 ng/mL, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.07]; p=0.84). Free IGF-1 levels at each time

328

point following oral glucose were: baseline 0.46 ± 0.22 ng/mL placebo vs. 0.44 ± 0.21 ng/mL

329

sitagliptin; 30 minutes after oral glucose 0.46 ± 0.19 ng/mL placebo vs. 0.43 ± 0.18 ng/mL

330

sitagliptin; 90 minutes after oral glucose 0.44 ± 0.20 ng/mL placebo vs. 0.46 ± 0.20 ng/mL

331

sitagliptin; 150 minutes after oral glucose 0.49 ± 0.26 ng/mL placebo vs. 0.45 ± 0.22 ng/mL

332

sitagliptin.

334

During overnight sampling after one month of sitagliptin, GH half-life (p=0.04 vs. placebo) and

335

consequently the median interpulse interval (p<0.05 vs. placebo) both increased, but GH AUC

336

and mean GH were stable (Table 3). Representative plots of overnight sampling of GH from 3

337

subjects are included in Figure 5. One month of daily sitagliptin had no effect on fasting free

338

IGF-1 levels, total IGF-1 levels, or IGFBP-3 levels (Table 3).

339
340

Effect of sitagliptin on vascular parameters and conduit artery vascular function

341

Sitagliptin increased heart rate during the 75-gram OGTT summarized as average over time

342

(mean difference 2 bpm, 95% CI [0.01, 4.06]; p<0.05) and during the inpatient study day (from

343

67.4 ± 9.3 to 71.3 ± 6.9 bpm; p<0.05). One month of sitagliptin did not affect inflammatory or

344

fibrinolytic markers. Sitagliptin also had no effect on conduit artery vascular function during

345

reactive hyperemia. (Table 4) A limited number of women (N=3) met criteria for assessment of

346

endothelium-independent vasodilation using nitroglycerin and agreed to its administration.

347

Sitagliptin did not influence vasodilation after 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin (36.5% ± 13.7 after

348

placebo vs. 36.4% ± 9.0 after sitagliptin, p>0.05).

349
350

Effect of sitagliptin on body composition and characteristics of PCOS

351

One month of sitagliptin therapy decreased VAT mass (p=0.02 vs. placebo) and volume (p=0.02

352

vs. placebo), but did not significantly affect weight or overall percent fat (Table 5). Sitagliptin

353

decreased total cholesterol (from 168.8 ± 26.3 to 162.5 ± 22.2 mg/dL; p=0.02) largely due to a

354

decrease in LDL (from 101.9 ± 23.8 to 96.2 ±21.5 mg/dL; p=0.06). One-month treatment with

355

sitagliptin did not influence estradiol or testosterone levels (Table 5). Sitagliptin did not affect

problems), as assessed by PCOS Questionnaire administered on the last day of each therapy

(p=1.00 vs. placebo for each domain).

359
360

Association between DPP4 inhibition and GH levels, VAT, and HOMA-IR

361

Sitagliptin did not increase overnight GH secretion or lower insulin resistance. Greater DPP4

362

inhibition in response to sitagliptin, however, correlated with GH levels, VAT and HOMA-IR.

363

The degree of DPP4 inhibition with sitagliptin correlated with GH secretion, such that DPP4

364

inhibition was associated with overnight GH secretion (GH AUC: rs= 0.60, p=0.02; mean GH: rs=

365

0.59, p=0.02). DPP4 inhibition after sitagliptin was also associated with VAT mass (rs= -0.66;

366

p<0.01), and HOMA-IR (rs=-0.64; p=0.01). The correlations between DPP4 inhibition and GH

367

AUC, VAT, and HOMA-IR were no longer significant after controlling for BMI (GH AUC rs=0.25,

368

p=0.38; VAT rs=-0.31, p=0.25; HOMA-IR rs=-0.15; p=0.61) . Women with higher DPP4 inhibition

369

during sitagliptin treatment, i.e. those in whom the percent DPP4 inhibition (defined as [1-(DPP4

370

activity during sitagliptin/DPP4 activity during placebo)]*100) was above the median for the

371

women analyzed, had higher overnight GH secretion and lower VAT mass and HOMA-IR.

372

Figure 6 compares values between those with higher DPP4 inhibition and lower DPP4 inhibition

373

within the sitagliptin treatment. Similarly, women with greater DPP4 inhibition also had lower

BMI (30.3 ± 3.4 vs. 38.5 ± 6.3 kg/m2; p<0.01).

Discussion

388

This study tested the hypothesis that one-month treatment with the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin

389

would potentiate overnight GH secretion in overweight women with PCOS and improve glucose

390

levels. As expected, sitagliptin lowered blood glucose by increasing GLP-1 levels and

391

enhancing early insulin secretion following ingestion of oral glucose. Sitagliptin did not increase

392

mean overnight GH but did enhance GH half-life. Body composition also improved during

393

sitagliptin, as evidenced by a decrease in VAT, while weight and BMI remained stable. These

394

findings indicate that DPP4 inhibition with sitagliptin decreases the maximal glucose response to

395

OGTT, improves body composition, and increases GH half-life in overweight women with

396

PCOS.

397
398

Altered GLP-1 and insulin secretion following oral glucose ingestion has previously been

399

reported even in lean, glucose-tolerant women with PCOS. Women with PCOS have higher

400

levels of c-peptide and tend to have higher levels of insulin secretion particularly in the first hour

401

after glucose ingestion. While active GLP-1 levels are similar in women with PCOS and healthy

402

volunteers early on, they are lower in women with PCOS after one hour.(34) The glucagon

403

response to hypoglycemia is also potentiated in obese women with PCOS as compared to

404

matched controls.(35) We hypothesized that sitagliptin, with its ability to potentiate post-

405

prandial GLP-1 secretion and suppress glucagon secretion, would mitigate these undesirable

406

post-glucose changes. We observed enhanced GLP-1 secretion during sitagliptin, but no

407

changes in glucagon levels.

408
409

Only one previous study has evaluated the effect of sitagliptin on glucose homeostasis in

410

women with PCOS. Ferjan et al. conducted a 12-week study of obese women with PCOS in

411

which women were randomized to open label sitagliptin 100 mg daily with lifestyle intervention

412

or lifestyle intervention alone following metformin withdrawal.(36) The investigators found that

413

sitagliptin improved beta cell function and even prevented the conversion from impaired glucose

414

tolerance to type 2 diabetes mellitus in three of the women. The investigators did not appreciate

415

a significant decrease in glucose levels during OGTT. In contrast, we observed that sitagliptin

416

enhanced GLP-1 secretion following oral glucose ingestion which resulted in enhanced early

417

insulin secretion and a significant decrease in the blood glucose rise following oral glucose

418

ingestion. Our relatively more homogeneous study population and cross-over design likely

419

enabled us to detect better an improvement in blood glucose levels.

420
421

The effect of sitagliptin on post-prandial GH secretion has not previously been investigated. It is

422

well known that oral glucose ingestion quickly inhibits GH secretion before a late stimulatory

423

effect on GHRH-mediated GH levels. Relatively little is known, however, about the metabolic

424

factors that influence GH secretion following oral glucose. Grottoli et al. demonstrated that early

425

GH inhibition following glucose ingestion is lost in obesity but the late stimulatory effect is

426

maintained.(37) Iranmanesh et al further demonstrated that nadir and peak rebound GH

427

secretion is influenced by VAT and SHBG in obese men.(38) Potential mechanisms by which

428

sitagliptin might alter the GH secretion in response to an OGTT in women with PCOS include

429

enhanced late GH secretion due to decreased degradation of the GHRH stimulus or mitigation

430

of the known inhibitory effects of hyperglycemia and free fatty acids on GH secretion. Although

431

sitagliptin lowered blood glucoses following oral glucose ingestion, we did not observe any

432

effect of sitagliptin on free fatty acids or on GH secretion.

433

intravenous GLP-1 infusion in men reduces IGFBP-1 and tended to increase IGF-1

434

bioactivity.(39) We did see an increase in GLP-1 and early insulin secretion, but this did not

435

significantly influence IGFBP-1 levels or free IGF-1 levels. Thus, it is unlikely that alterations in

436

insulin secretion, blood glucoses, IGFBP-1, or GLP-1 levels contribute to the altered post-

437

glucose GH secretion described in obesity. Furthermore, IGF-1 did not contribute to the

438

observed changes in glucose metabolism in our study participants.

Skov et al also demonstrated that

439
440

Our study investigates a novel potential strategy to enhance endogenous GH secretion in a

441

population of patients demonstrated to have diminished GH levels. Obese individuals have

442

diminished GH secretion, characterized by fewer GH pulses and shorter half-life duration.(40)

443

De Boer et. al. observed impaired overnight GH secretion in PCOS patients, irrespective of

444

weight and degree of insulin resistance.(12) We found that one month of sitagliptin therapy

445

influences overnight GH secretion by increasing GH half-life. The inter-pulse interval, which

446

represents the time interval between secretion events and is partially dependent upon half-life in

447

addition to the previous inter-pulse interval and secretion event area, was also

448

increased.(28,29) Sitagliptin did not increase overnight GH levels. Although overnight GH

449

secretion correlated with DPP4 inhibition after sitagliptin. this was not the case after controlling

450

for BMI.

451
452

Our study was not designed to determine the mechanism by which sitagliptin influences the

453

overnight GH secretory profile. Possible mechanisms include decreased degradation of the

454

GHRH stimulus by DPP4, or increased GH as an indirect result of decreased VAT. In support

455

of the first mechanism, Makimura et. al. reported that twelve months of the DPP4-resistant

456

GHRH analogue, tesamorelin, increases IGF-1 and selectively decreases VAT in obese

457

subjects with reduced GH secretion.(41) In contrast, we did not find that sitagliptin affected IGF-

458

1 levels, yet VAT was still selectively affected. The lack of effect of sitagliptin on IGF-1 levels is

459

not surprising given that sitagliptin did not affect overnight GH secretion. In support of the

460

second mechanism, Vahl et al found that abdominal obesity was the single most significant

461

determinant of pulsatile GH release, as determined by twenty-four hour GH profile.(42) Pijl et.

462

al. studied the effect of caloric restriction and 50% loss of body weight over a 3 to 5 month

463

period in obese women and observed an increase in mean 24 hour GH secretion.(6) Similar to

464

our findings, they observed an increase in GH half-life with no effect on IGF-1 levels. This

465

report is consistent with our observation of a smaller yet significant decrease in VAT and

466

increase in GH half-life after only one month of sitagliptin in our subjects. Dichtel LE et al

467

reported that in overweight and obese women, increases in bioactive IGF-1, rather than total

468

IGF-1, drive GH-mediated body composition changes in the short-term.(43) A decrease in GH

469

binding protein may also have played a role in the observed changes in GH half-life and inter-

470

pulse interval, as levels of GH binding protein directly correlate with VAT.(44) Lastly, another

471

mechanism possibly contributing to the decrease in VAT may be increased sympathetic activity.

472

We have previously reported that sitagliptin increases sympathetic activity during concurrent

473

angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition by decreasing degradation of the DPP4 and

474

ACE substrate substance P.(45) We did observe an increase in heart rate following sitagliptin

475

during the OGTT.

476
477

Others have reported that the addition of sitagliptin to metformin therapy improves body

478

composition in women with PCOS. Yan J et al reported that the addition of sitagliptin to

479

metformin treatment reduces VAT in patients with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver

480

disease.(46) Ferjan et. al. similarly found that sitagliptin prevents weight regain, as compared to

481

metformin alone, in a 12-week prospective open label study in 24 obese women with PCOS

482

previously treated with liraglutide.(47) Thus, a growing body of evidence suggests that

483

sitagliptin selectively reduces VAT. Despite the improvements in VAT and GH secretion, we did

484

not observe an improvement in any of the clinical signs or symptoms experienced by women

485

with PCOS, as reported in a validated PCOS questionnaire. Longer duration of therapy would

486

likely be necessary to detect a change in these parameters. Similarly, androgen levels were not

487

affected by sitagliptin. We would expect androgen levels to improve in association with an

488

improvement in insulin resistance, and the latter was not observed.

489
490

Our study further evaluates cardiovascular endpoints, such as vascular function and fibrinolysis,

491

which may be affected by enhanced GH secretion. GH directly improves vascular function

492

through several mechanisms, including activation of the GH receptor and downstream IGF-1

493

secretion (48), as well as GH receptor- and IGF-1-independent effects.(49) Li et. al. reported

494

that supra-physiologic circulating concentrations GH of approximately 33 ng/mL were necessary

495

to increase forearm blood flow.(1) Similarly, Napoli et al reported that intra-arterial GH infusion,

496

which raised local GH to approximately 40 ng/mL, increased forearm blood flow.(2) We

497

previously reported that sitagliptin increases forearm vasodilation, measured by strain gauge

498

plethysmography, in healthy women as assessed during stimulated GH secretion with peak

499

levels averaging 11.6 mg/dL.(11) In the present study, we did not observe any effect of

500

sitagliptin on conduit artery vascular function, however. Mean overnight GH levels in this study

501

in patients with PCOS were significantly lower than in our prior study in healthy women. The

502

changes in GH secretion induced by sitagliptin may have been insufficient to detect an effect on

503

forearm vasodilation. Other potential factors, such as increased sympathetic activity due to

504

decreased degradation of other DPP4 substrates such as substance P and neuropeptide Y,

505

may also have masked any GH-induced changes in vascular function.(45,50) It is also notable

506

that we did not observe any increase in vasodilation despite elevated GLP-1 levels during

507

sitagliptin. This is consistent with our previous observation that GLP-1 infusion into the forearm

508

vasculature does not increase vasodilation.(51)

509
510

We report for the first time the effect of chronic sitagliptin treatment on tPA activity and PAI-1

511

antigen levels. Despite the observed decrease in VAT and cholesterol, there was no significant

512

effect of sitagliptin on PAI-1. This contrasts with the data of Tani et al who found that eight-

513

week treatment with vildagliptin decreased triglycerides and PAI-1 in poorly controlled type 2

514

diabetic patients.(52) The investigators suggested that improved lipid metabolism resulted in

515

down-regulation of PAI-1 production from the vascular endothelial cells. Triglyceride and PAI-1

516

levels in the women in the current study were one-third of the levels in their study population,

517

thus making it difficult to detect further down-regulation of PAI-1 production. We have

518

previously demonstrated that GH affects tPA activity levels through the GH receptor and

519

downstream IGF-1 secretion,(11) but we did not observe any change in IGF-1 or tPA activity in

520

this study. We also did not see any effect of sitagliptin on inflammation, whereas Makdissi A et

521

al observed an anti-inflammatory effect of 100 mg daily sitagliptin on CRP, IL-6 and free fatty

522

acids after 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes.(53) Differences in study populations or

523

Our study has limitations. PCOS is a heterogeneous disorder; women may be lean or

526

overweight and may or may not have insulin resistance. We studied a relatively homogenous

527

subset of women with PCOS and our results may not be generalizable to all women with PCOS.

528

We chose to limit our study population to those women with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2 and to

529

exclude participants who were dieting with weight loss or titrating metformin therapy. This

530

subset of women with PCOS tends to represent the subset who are prescribed metformin in

531

order to improve glucose metabolism. We were interested in how sitagliptin influenced glucose

532

metabolism in overweight women with PCOS and we were limited to use of a manual

533

glucometer for glucose measurements, though the same glucometer was used for each woman

534

across study days. We also did not include baseline endogenous GH secretory capacity as a

535

selection criterion for the women studied, as is done in many clinical trials evaluating the effect

536

of an intervention on GH secretion. If we had pre-selected for a relatively GH-deficient

537

population, we may have seen a more prominent effect of sitagliptin on overnight GH secretion.

538

We were unable to standardize timing of the endpoint measurements to womens’ menstrual

539

cycles, as most women had infrequent menstrual cycles. This is particularly relevant in our

540

assessments of overnight GH secretion and vascular function. We did not observe a difference

541

in estradiol levels across study treatments, however. Our treatment duration was one month,

542

which may not have been sufficient to appreciate any effect of sitagliptin on clinical symptoms,

543

or inflammatory or fibrinolytic markers. We chose to use the current FDA-approved daily dose

544

of sitagliptin, however we have previously demonstrated that 100 mg daily of sitagliptin is not as

545

effective as single-dose 200 mg sitagliptin in inhibiting DPP4 activity in healthy individuals, and

546

that sitagliptin 100 mg daily is less effective in inhibiting DPP4 activity in individuals with type 2

547

diabetes mellitus and hypertension than in healthy individuals.(54) A higher dose of sitagliptin

548

resulting in maximal DPP4 inhibition may have yielded a greater treatment effect on mean GH

549

and eliminated any effect of weight on response to sitagliptin. Our limited sample size may

550

have limited our conclusions on overnight GH secretion parameters. We observed low intra-

551

individual variability in the pattern of overnight GH secretion, however, and the cross-over

552

design of the study would have increased our ability to detect treatment effects. Lastly, our

553

study design did not enable us to determine the mechanism by which sitagliptin may enhance

554

GH half-life.

555
556

In this study, we evaluated the previously unexplored effects of sitagliptin in overweight women

557

with PCOS. We demonstrate for the first time that sitagliptin enhances GLP-1 levels and early

558

insulin secretion and thereby decreases peak blood glucose following oral glucose ingestion in

559

these women. Second, we demonstrate that sitagliptin improves body composition, through an

560

undefined mechanism. As weight loss remains the cornerstone of treatment for PCOS, this is

561

also a highly desirable effect. Lastly, this study is the first to suggest an off-target effect of

562

sitagliptin on GH secretion in women with PCOS, potentiating GH half-life and the inter-pulse

563

interval. This is relevant as endogenous GH secretion is diminished in women with PCOS. (12-

564

14) These data are the first to support the use of oral DPP4 inhibitor therapy to address

565

elevated blood glucoses and body composition in women with PCOS, and to probe the

566

contribution of an altered somatotropic axis in the pathophysiology of this common disorder.

Figure 1. Participant Flow Diagram. Fifty-five women with polycystic ovarian syndrome

747

(PCOS) were screened for study participation and 32 were determined to be eligible. Twenty-

748

three women agreed to participate and were randomized to study drug. Eighteen of these

749

women participated in both study arms and their data were included in analyses. Complete

750

data was available only from both outpatient visits in one woman. Another woman did not

751

complete the overnight GH sampling portion of both inpatient visits.

Figure 2. Subjects participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,

753

crossover study. Eighteen women underwent two one-month treatment periods (sitagliptin

754

100 mg p.o. qd or matching placebo) separated by a washout period of at least eight weeks. On

755

each study day, subjects reported to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC) in the

756

morning after an overnight fast. After approximately two weeks of study drug, subjects

757

underwent an extended OGTT (75-grams oral glucola). Women were then discharged and

758

continued daily study drug at home for an additional two weeks. On the last day of study drug,

759

women (N=17) again reported to the CRC for collection of fasting venous samples,

760

measurement of endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, measurement of total

761

and regional body composition via duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and frequent venous

762

sampling for GH every ten minutes for twelve hours overnight.

Figure 5. Representative plots of overnight GH levels from 3 subjects during placebo and

778

sitagliptin treatment. GH samples are obtained every 10 minutes from 8 PM to 8 AM. The

779

plots illustrate the high inter-individual variability but low intra-individual variability in overnight

780

GH secretion.

781

Figure 6. Women with a higher percent DPP4 inhibition had higher overnight GH

782

secretion (A and B, N=16) and lower VAT mass (C, N=17) and HOMA-IR (D, N=17) after

783

one-month treatment with sitagliptin. Data were obtained on the inpatient visit day and are

784

expressed as mean ± SD. P values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Higher

785

percent DPP4 inhibition is defined as percent DPP4 inhibition at or greater than the median for

786

the 17 women included in the analysis, where percent DPP4 inhibition = [1-(DPP4 activity

787

during sitagliptin/DPP4 activity during placebo)]*100. Comparisons between higher and lower

788

DPP4 inhibition were not significant after controlling for BMI (GH AUC p=0.27; mean GH

789

p=0.24; VAT p=0.67; HOMA-IR p=0.66)
