ABSTRACT

26
27

To demonstrate the feasibility of robotic middle ear access in a clinical setting, nine adult patients with

28

severe-to-profound hearing loss indicated for cochlear implantation were included in this clinical trial. A

29

keyhole access tunnel to the tympanic cavity and targeting the round window was planned based on

30

preoperatively acquired computed tomography image data and robotically drilled to the level of the facial

31

recess. Intraoperative imaging was performed to confirm sufficient distance of the drilling trajectory to

32

relevant anatomy. Robotic drilling continued toward the round window. The cochlear access was manually

33

created by the surgeon. Electrode arrays were inserted through the keyhole tunnel under microscopic

34

supervision via a tympanomeatal flap. All patients were successfully implanted with a cochlear implant. In

35

9 of 9 patients the robotic drilling was planned and performed to the level of the facial recess. In 3 patients,

36

the procedure was reverted to a conventional approach for safety reasons. No change in facial nerve function

37

compared to baseline measurements was observed. Robotic keyhole access for cochlear implantation is

38

feasible. Further improvements to workflow complexity, duration of surgery, and usability including safety

39

assessments are required to enable wider adoption of the procedure.

INTRODUCTION

42
43

Advances in image guidance, robotic technology and minimally-invasive techniques offer an opportunity to

44

transform inner ear surgery from open procedures to keyhole approaches. Over four decades after the

45

description by House [1], conventional cochlear implant (CI) surgery remains essentially unchanged. The

46

success story of CIs with about 600.000 implant users worldwide, shows the procedure is widely considered

47

safe and effective [2-4]. Nevertheless, alternative implantation techniques to further improve patient

48

outcomes such as reduced mastoidectomy under endoscopic supervision [5] and endaural implantation

49

techniques have been proposed (e.g., the pericanal, suprameatal, or Veria approaches) [6-8]. However,

50

mastoidectomy followed by a posterior tympanotomy remains the standard surgical approach to the inner

51

ear for cochlear implantation.

52
53

Keyhole access CI surgery has become an active area of change for the procedure, with a view that image-

54

guided, minimally-invasive and robotic equipment could be the starting point for a dedicated robotic CI

55

procedure that could facilitate standardization of CI surgery and potentially impact hearing outcomes.

56

Labadie et. al investigated a stereotactic frame-based keyhole intervention in eight CI patients [9]. Our group

57

has developed the concept of robotic cochlear implantation (RCI) including elements of image-based

58

procedural planning, robotic middle and inner ear access and finally robotic CI insertion, which aims to

59

enable optimization and standardization of care. Following on from the first-in-man procedure [10], a

60

clinical trial was carried out to test the hypothesis that a robotic and task-autonomous drill protocol can be

61

applied to return the required geometric accuracy to enable a keyhole approach for cochlea implantation on

62

varying anatomy. More specifically, elements such as the i) pre-operative planning process, the ii) multi-

63

layer safety architecture and iii) tunnel based electrode insertion were clinically evaluated. Here we present

64

the concluding report on the robotic middle ear access procedure carried out on a clinical pilot population

65

of nine patients.

METHODS

67

Study Design

68

We performed a non-randomized single-center first-in-man trial to evaluate the clinical feasibility of RCI

69

(Figure 1). The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board (Ethics Commission of

70

Bern, KEK-BE PB_2017-00312) and regulatory body (Swissmedic, Nr. 2013-MD-0042, EUDAMED CIV-

71

13-12-011779) and registered (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02641795, trial registration on December

72

29th, 2015). Recruitment took place between 01.07.2016 and 22.08.2018 and surgeries took place between

73

14.07.2016 and 15.02.2018. All study procedures were performed at a tertiary referral hospital (Inselspital,

74

Bern) in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. CI candidacy was evaluated according to a

75

routine patient work-up, including medical, neuroradiological, and audiological assessment. Study-specific

76

procedures consisted of screening, facial nerve function baseline testing at one day before surgery, the

77

robotic intervention, computed tomography (CT) imaging one day after surgery, and follow-up testing 10

78

to 14 days after surgery. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 1 day, 2 weeks and 1 month after surgery.

79

Safety of the trial was monitored by a board of three independent external reviewers.

Study Participants

84

Forty-three subjects were screened in our department as part of the CI candidacy assessment routine. Besides

85

general accordance with conventional eligibility for CI surgery, subjects had to be 18 years or older, fluent

86

in German or French, have a sufficient facial recess size (i.e., at least 2.5 mm, allowing for 0.4 mm safety

87

margin to the facial nerve and 0.3 mm to the chorda tympani using a 1.8 mm drill bit). Exclusion criteria

88

were: pregnancy, anatomical malformations of the middle or inner ear or abnormal course of the facial

89

nerve. Existing preoperative CT datasets of the temporal bone were used to assess anatomical conditions

90

and facial recess size [10]. In total, nine subjects gave written informed consented and were subsequently

91

enrolled in the study (Table 1).

97

Baseline Testing

98

The motor portion of the facial nerve was evaluated using the standard Sunnybrook composite score [11];

99

and facial nerve conduction studies. The facial nerve was stimulated supramaximal at the mandibular angle,

100

and amplitude and latency of the compound muscle action potentials were recorded using surface electrodes

101

from the frontal, nasal, and mental muscles [12].

102
103

Patient Preparation and intervention planning

104

The complete intervention was performed under general anesthesia. A 5 cm long retroauricular incision was

105

created. A physical template was used to mark and insert four bone fiducial screws serving as artificial

106

landmarks for patient-to-plan registration [13]. Patients were then transferred for preoperative CT imaging

107

(Somatom CT, Siemens, Germany; voxel size: 0.156 × 0.156 × 0.2 mm3; 120 kVp) in the neuroradiological

108

department to confirm correct insertion of the four implanted screws. Using a specific planning software

109

[14], the team of the responsible surgeon, neuroradiologist and a trained computer engineer conducted next

110

the procedural planning. First, the bony part of the external auditory canal, the facial nerve, the chorda

111

tympani and the ossicles were annotated in the image data. Next, the access trajectory through the facial

112

recess (diameter 1.8 mm distal and 2.5 mm proximal) from the mastoid surface to the center of the round

113

window membrane, providing for an optimal insertion angle [15], was identified and defined in the image

114

data. Meanwhile, the patient was transferred back to the operating room and prepared for the procedure [10].

115

The patient head was non-invasively constrained using a task specific headrest. Two sets of paired needle

116

electrodes were inserted into the periorbital and perioral muscles to provide for facial nerve monitoring. To

117

compensate for respiratory motion, the patients head was tracked via a skull attached dynamic reference

118

base, aligned with the systems tracking camera [16].

119
120

Robotic Middle Ear Access

121

Upon patient-to-image registration, a task specific robotic system [17,16] was used to drill the access tunnel

122

(Figure 2) in 3 phases: (i) drilling from the surface of the mastoid bone until 3 mm before the facial nerve,

123

(ii) passing through the facial recess, and (iii) completing the access to the middle ear cavity. Robotic drilling

124

was performed in steps (with complete extraction of the drill bit between steps to allow for cooling and

125

cleaning) with a feed forward rate of 0.5 mm per second and with 1000 revolutions per minute. Drilling

126

increments of 0.5 mm and 2 mm were used for the passage of the facial recess and during the less critical

127

phases drill phases i) and iii) respectively.

131
132

Intraoperative imaging

133

Upon reaching the level of the facial nerve, the robot was moved away from the operating table and a

134

titanium rod was inserted into the drilled tunnel. At that point the temporal bone region was repeated imaged

135

with a low-dose radiation, cone-based CT scanner for use in operating rooms (xCAT, Xoran, Ann Arbor,

136

USA; voxel resolution: 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3, 120 kVp, 6 mA; Figure 3 left). The acquired image data were

137

used to measure the distances of the drill tunnel to surrounding anatomical structures by using an automatic

138

detection algorithm [18]. A safe trajectory was also confirmed manually on the image data by a present

139

neuroradiologist. The distance of the drill tunnel to relevant anatomy was also assessed by the systems

140

integrated force-density pose estimation calculation [16,19]. Subsequently, the responsible surgeon decided

141

whether the robotic procedure would continue (i.e., phase ii) or be reverted to a conventional approach.

142
143

Electromyography for facial nerve monitoring

144

Integrity of the facial nerve was monitored continuously through i) measuring potential electromyography

145

(EMG) discharges elicited by mechanical irritation of the facial nerve during the complete drilling and ii)

146

analyzing compound muscle action potentials from multipolar stimulation specifically when passing the

147

facial nerve [12,20].

148
149

Implantation

150

After completion of the access tunnel, the landmark screws and the dynamic reference base were removed.

151

The tunnel was cleaned using irrigation and suction. Tunnel alignment with the round window was inspected

152

with a sialendoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). The retroauricular incision was extended inferiorly

153

and a tympanomeatal flap was created as an auxiliary access to the tympanic cavity [21]. The round window

154

niche was microscopically visualized through the external auditory canal. Through the tympanomeatal flap,

155

the bony overhang of the round window was removed using a skeeter drill (Bien-Air, Biel, Switzerland).

156

Next, the implant bed was prepared. As opposed to conventional CI surgery, the excess lead of the implant

157

cannot be accommodated within the mastoidectomy with the minimally invasive approach. Therefore, a

158

superficial well (2 mm in depth) was milled into the cortex of the bone to enable safe embedding. This step

159

was not required to the same extent with the custom-made device implants featuring shortened leads

160

(subjects 04 and 06). The middle ear cavity and the implant bed were cleaned to avoid intrusion of bone

161

dust and blood into the cochlea during electrode array insertion. The round window membrane was opened

162

with a micro-needle. If required, a custom-made insertion guide tube, was placed inside the tunnel to assist

163

insertion [22] and provide against unwanted contamination of the electrode with blood. Sodium hyaluronate

164

was applied as lubricant (ProVisc®, Alcon, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The electrode array was slowly inserted

165

until the first point of resistance. After insertion, the guide tube was removed and the round window niche

166

was sealed with fatty tissue. The excess lead was fixed at the top of the tunnel using bone wax (Ethicon,

167

Somerville, US). Following implant telemetry, the wound was closed. Implant body management was

168

adapted from the conventional CI procedure.

169
170

Outcome measures

171

Drilling accuracy (primary outcome) was measured in available intraoperative CB-CT scans at the level of

172

the facial recess as the absolute centerline displacement of the planned versus the drilled tunnel. The number

173

of fully completed robotic accesses to the tympanic cavity, the total procedural durations and durations of

174

all sub-procedures were recorded. Postoperative high-resolution CT scans of the temporal bone were used

175

to measure the angular insertion depth (in degrees) and the implanted scala (secondary outcomes). The

176

surgical follow up included assessment of pain (visual analog scale) and any potential clinical complications.

177

Functional preservation of the facial nerve was postoperatively assessed relative to the preoperative baseline

178

measurements. Structural preservation of the chorda tympani was confirmed by a neuroradiologist in the

179

standard postoperative high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone with similar scanning parameters to

180

the preoperative CT. Audiological fitting was performed according to our standard routine, i.e., activation

181

and initial fitting at 1 month and consecutive fitting sessions at up to 12 months after the surgery.

182

Audiological evaluation included the number of activated channels, aided sound field thresholds (pure tone

183

average over 0.5/1/2/4 kHz, in dB HL), aided word recognition scores (in %) for monosyllables (at 65 dB

184

SPL) and numbers (at 70 dB SPL). If applicable, the degree of hearing preservation (in %) was quantified

185

[23].

RESULTS

188

Feasibility

189

Of 43 initially assessed subjects planned for cochlear implantation, 29 patients were screened for facial

190

recess size, the other 14 patients were excluded because one or more of the other inclusion criteria were

191

unmet. Eighteen of the 29 patients had a sufficient facial recess size and were eligible for the study. Of

192

those, nine patients consented to participation in the trial. In all nine patients, a safe access tunnel to the

193

level of the facial recess was planned and drilled. The complete robotic procedure including drilling through

194

the facial recess was performed in 6 of 9 patients. Insufficient distances to the facial nerve (< 0.3 mm) and

195

the tympanic membrane (< 0.1 mm) were detected in the available intraoperative image data in patients 8

196

and 9 respectively. Hence, procedures were reverted to a conventional transmastoid posterior tympanotomy.

197

In subject 2, the patient’s mastoid region could not be imaged due to workspace limitations and a compressed

198

cervical spine region. Hence, as intraoperative image data was required for confirmation of sufficient tool

199

clearance by study design, this case was also reverted to the standard procedure. In all 3 reverted cases

200

clearance of the drill trajectory to the facial nerve was confirmed microscopically during mastoidectomy

201

(Figure 3 right). Drilling accuracy, measured as the deviation between the planned and the drilled tunnel at

202

the level of the facial recess, was 0.21 mm ± 0.09 mm (Table 2) which is in-line with preclinical validation

203

[17]. All nine patients were implanted with a CI (SYNCHRONY, MED-EL, Innsbruck, Austria) under full

204

preservation of facial nerve function. No abnormal EMG activity or low stimulation thresholds were

205

identified during the entire robotic drilling phases. Implanted subjects neither showed a change in

206

Sunnybrook composite score nor in facial nerve conduction study parameters compared to baseline

207

measurements. In all cases, preservation of the chorda tympani was confirmed in the postoperative image

208

evaluation. Overall, procedural blood loss was less than 50 ml loss in eight of nine cases, and 170 ml in one

209

case. One day after surgery, eight of nine patients reported pain levels below or equal 2 using a visual analog

210

scale and were painless in the follow-up examinations. In the six patients with a complete robotic middle

211

ear access, the electrode array was inserted through the drilled tunnel with an angular insertion depth of

212

501° ± 94° (Table 2). In subject 1, plaque formation in the cochlear basal turn (Cogan syndrome) prevented

213

insertion into the scala tympani and resulted in scala vestibuli placement as predicted in the preoperative

214

planning [10]. Scala tympani insertion was reported in all other subjects. All patients were discharged from

215

hospital one day after surgery.

DISCUSSION

250
251

Based on the criterion of sufficient width of the facial recess, 62% of screened patients (18 of 29) were

252

eligible. This compares favorably with a previous estimate of 47% [24]. The feasibility of the surgeon

253

driven, task-autonomous robotic drilling procedure was demonstrated in 6 of 9 patients. In 3 patients, the

254

RCI workflow decision-making led the team to revert the procedure to a conventional CI. The study shows

255

that micro-surgical robotic technology can be deployed in a clinically resilient manner and across varying

256

patient anatomies to deliver geometrically-accurate keyhole, access to the inner ear. In subject 02, the

257

workspace limitation of the intraoperative CB-CT scanner caused reversion to a conventional procedure,

258

which can be avoided by employing pre-surgical anatomy assessments or alternative imaging technologies

259

with greater imaging volumes. In subjects 08 and 09, the deviated drill tunnel (Table 2) led to critical

260

proximity to the facial nerve and auditory canal wall and thus the procedures were reverted. Although these

261

two subjects did not have a full, robotic drill path past the facial nerve, the procedures demonstrated the

262

effectiveness of intraoperative imaging at the decision point 3 mm before being level with the facial nerve,

263

as a key safety feature. The previously identified and validated drill geometry configuration and drill process

264

parametrization [25] demonstrated feasibility and safety in all 9 subjects. In the six cases with a complete

265

robotic middle ear access, the force density drill pose safety assessment corroborated the safe passage

266

determined on intraoperative images. EMG based distance measurements made intermittently and while

267

passing the facial recess were always conclusive with the imaging-based tool-to-nerve distance assessments

268

and resulted in safe continuation of the robotic drilling procedure [12]. In all implanted patients, both the

269

clinical and electrophysiological facial nerve function remained intact compared to baseline measurements.

270

Time required for intraoperative imaging confirmation of sufficient instrument-to-nerve distance was 54

271

mins. Nonetheless, workflow optimization and complete intraoperative integration of imaging and image

272

analysis technology (both for planning and confirmation) into the workflow and routine OR work will lead

273

to significant time and cost reductions. During this trial an auxiliary access was required for three reasons:

274

(i) drilling of the cochlear access, in our case by removal of the bony overhang, (ii) as backup access in case

275

of bleeding or unanticipated problems during array insertion, and (iii) sealing of the cochlear access after

276

insertion completion. To facilitate the lifting of the tympanomeatal flap, an L-shaped retroauricular incision

277

was replaced by a C-shaped incision after the first case. In future, optimized electrode array designs and

278

robotically performed inner ear access and electrode array insertion may remove the need for this secondary

279

access. Although, not being an endpoint of this trial, we demonstrated that hearing preservation can be

280

achieved with the RCI procedure. Audiological outcomes compare favorably to conventional cochlear

281

implantation [26,27], however further study is required.

282
283

The presented work introduces task-autonomous surgical robotics to the field of otological microsurgery

284

(autonomy level 2) [28]. Robotic technology offers possibilities to overcome human operator limitations to

285

provide for reproducible, minimally invasive cochlear access and ultimately a deliberate and accurate

286

electrode insertion process, potentially widening CI patient eligibility in the future. We consider the work

287

presented as a first step towards this goal and believe to have demonstrated feasibility of the overall approach

288

in a sufficient variety of patient anatomies and workflow iterations. Interestingly, a robotic keyhole access

289

renders direct visual supervision of the actual drilling process impossible. Hence, safety elements such as

290

EMG-based facial nerve monitoring and intraoperative imaging were utilized to confirm correct drill

291

alignment. To ensure safety of the robotic access and to demonstrate the efficacy of the applied safety

292

measures, independent clinical trials with larger patient numbers need to be performed. Compared to

293

conventional cochlear implantation, the presented approach is more time-consuming and labor-intensive.

294

As with all novel surgical techniques, an increased average duration of the surgery owing to learning curve

295

and the execution of safety procedures is to be expected throughout the first cases. Most prominently and

296

because of the underlying technological complexity, every step in the workflow was carefully co-checked,

297

monitored and confirmed by the multi-disciplinary team, resulting in a reduced overall workflow efficiency.

298

In addition, preoperative high-resolution CT scans were conducted outside the OR (resulting in patient

299

preparation and transportation) prolonging the overall procedure time. Additionally, time was required for

300

intraoperative imaging together with the necessary image data transfer, peer assessment and subsequent

301

decision making. Further integration of intraoperative imaging devices will drastically reduce the time

302

needed for pre- and intraoperative imaging and image processing. To introduce a complete robotic cochlear

303

implantation approach, we are currently developing and investigating solutions for robotic inner ear access,

304

robotic electrode insertion, multi-port scenarios [29], narrower drills (i.e. 1mm to 1.4 mm) with integrated

305

monitoring electrodes and ultimately robotics compliant CI implant technology.
