Abstract
Objectives: We performed a pooled analysis to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of
olanzapine combined with dexamethasone plus compared with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone for
the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in high and
moderate emetogenic chemotherapy based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China Biomedical
Literature database (CBM), WanFang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure
(CNKI), and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) (from their inception to
April 2019) were searched to capture relevant articles. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for CINV and AEs were all extracted or calculated.
Result: Eleven studies with 1107 cancer patients were involved in this review. The pooled RR of
delayed CINV (RR=0.50, 95%CI: 0.38-0.66, P<0.01) were significant decreased in olanzapine
group. Besides, the occurrence of insomnia was statistically decreased. The rate of acute CINV
(RR=0.60, 95%CI: 0.48–0.75, P<0.01) was also significant decreased. However only the percent
of CINV and CINV were significant deceased in acute and delayed phase. Subgroup analysis
demonstrated that the efficacy was no statistically significant difference between 5mg and 10mg
for olanzapine.
Conclusion: Olanzapine significant decreased the occurrence of CINV and and insomnia in
high and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Compared with 10mg per day, 5mg oral may be
more appropriate for patients with cancer.

Introduction
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common adverse effect (AE) in the
treatment of cancer, which can significantly impair the patient’s quality of life, resulting in poor
compliance and malnutrition [1]. The incidence of acute CINV (occurrence within 24 hours of
administration of chemotherapy) was 36%, and 59% for delayed CINV (two to five days after the
administration of chemotherapy)[2]. 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) RA[3], dexamethasone
and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) RA[4]has significantly decreased the incidence of CINV, while there is
still 54.7% of patients experience nausea when 5-HT3 RA, dexamethasone and NK-1 RA are
used[5].
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved olanzapine as an antipsychotic agent that

blocks α1 adrenergic receptors ,serotonin 5-HT2a, 5-HT2c, 5-HT3, 5-HT6 receptors, muscarinic
receptors, dopamine D1, D2, D3 receptors, and histamine H1 receptors[5]. Blocking the receptors
of dopamine D2, 5-HT2c, and 5-HT3 played the role of antiemetic, and randomized controlled
trials (RCTs)[6, 7] and meta-analyses[8-10] have suggested that olanzapine is useful for patients
with cancers received chemotherapy. 2016 MASCC/ESMO guidelines[11] recommend olanzapine
combined with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone to prevent CINV, but the level of recommendation
was graded to low. NCCN Guidelines for antiemesis (Version 1.2019) also recommend olanzapine
combined with a 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone after NK-1 RA for high and moderate
emetogenic chemotherapy, however 5mg per day was consider only when 10 mg per day caused
serious sedation. RCTs[12, 13] with 5mg oral a day were demonstrated effective, and randomized
phase II dose-finding study[14] even find 5mg had a higher complete control in delayed CINV
compared with 10mg (83.1% vs. 77.6%). Meta-analysis[15] also find 5 mg and 10 mg olanzapine
exhibited similar efficacy, however three (olanzapine, 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone) or four
drugs (olanzapine, 5-HT3 RA, NK-1 RA and dexamethasone) were used, besides the level of
CINV was not reported. Therefore we designed this review to evaluate the efficacy and adverse
events of olanzapine combined with a 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone related to 5-HT3 RA plus
dexamethasone for the prevention and treatment of CINV in high and moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy based on currently available studies.

Methods
This review was performed following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions. Moreover, we reported pooled results by the recommendations listed in the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, and
Supplemental Data 1 showed the details.

Search Strategy
PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, WanFang Database, China
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database
(VIP) and China Biomedical Literature database (CBM) (from corresponding inception to April
2019) were searched using the following terms: “olanzapine”, “chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting”, “CINV”, “emesis”, “nausea”. The search strategy for PubMed was documented in
Supplemental Data 2. Language or date restrictions were not imposed. The bibliographies of
relevant trials and review were also browsed. Two researchers independently (LH and CX)
conducted in this part, and any inconsistency was solved by consulting a third researcher (HM).

Study Inclusion
Two reviewers (J-G Z and LH) independently screened studies based on inclusion and
exclusion criteria, and any inconsistency was resolved by the third investigator (HM). Eligible
studies must meet the following criteria: 1) population, cancer patients who received high and
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy classified by MASCC/ESMO guidelines[11]; 2)
intervention, olanzapine combined with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone for the prevention and
treatment of CINV; 3) comparison, dexamethasone plus 5-HT3 RA for the prevention and
treatment of CINV; 4) outcome, primary endpoint: the percent of delay CINV; secondary endpoint:
AEs; 5) study type, we only considered RCTs.

Exclusion Criterion
Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients with no- solid tumors; 2) other antiemetic drugs
were used (ie, NK-1 RA); 3) letters to editor or meeting abstracts.

Data Extraction
Two researchers (S-H J and CX) evaluated the eligibility of all identified studies eligible
through checking abstracts and titles following to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and full-text
were read carefully for possible articles. Data involved authors, country, population, publication
year, drug dosage, and duration, the percentage of acute and delayed CINV and AEs. All
divergences about eligibility assessment and data extraction were solved through consulting a
third senior investigator (HM).

Assessment of Methodologic Quality
The methodologic quality was appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk Bias

assessment tool for assessing the risk of bias[16] by two researchers (J-G Z and CX), and RevMan
(version 5.3) was used in this part. Seven domains (blinding of outcome assessment, blinding of
participants and personnel, selective reporting, allocation concealment, random-sequence
generation, incomplete outcome data, and other bias) were assessed for each study, and all of them
were labeled with "high risk," "unclear risk," or "low risk".

Statistical Analysis
The dichotomous outcomes were estimated using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence

intervals (CIs). I2 statistic and P value were used to estimate the level of heterogeneity of involved
studies[17]. We considered heterogeneity substantial if I2 ≥50% or P<0.10[18]. Fixed model was
used when I2 <50% or P>0.10, if significant heterogeneity was conducted, random model was
used. On the contrary, if the noticeable difference were found in clinical characteristic and
methodology, regardless of I2 statistic or P-value, a belief of qualitative analysis was conducted.
Subgroup analysis of olanzapine dosage (5mg vs. 10mg) was also conducted. We did all analyses
using R (version 3.3.0) and the "meta" package.

Result
Literature Research and Characteristics of Studies
As showed in supplemental data 3, a total of 787 studies of olanzapine for the prevention and
treatment CINV were identified. Finally, 11 articles[12, 13, 19-27] were involved in our review
according to the inclusion criterion.
All involved studies were published from 2009 to 2018, and 1107 patients with cancer were
involved in this review, involving 561 patients in olanzapine olanzapine group and 546 patients in
control group. Except for Mukhopadhyay et al [19], all studies were from China. All patients with
solid tumors received highly or moderated emetogenic chemotherapy, and the all compared
olanzapine combined with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone compared with 5-HT3 RA plus
dexamethasone for the prevention and treatment of CINV. Two different olanzapine dosage was
used in the intervention group, six studies[19-21, 24, 26, 27]were 10 mg orally once a day, and

four studies[12, 13, 22, 25] were 5mg oral once a day and Meng et al [23] was 2.5mg oral twice a
day. Six studies[12, 13, 21-24] reported CINV according to the world health organization (WHO)
classification standards for gastrointestinal reactions of anticancer drugs, and CINV
(nausea
without vomiting), CINV
(vomiting 1-2 times a day, does not affect the eating), CINV
(nausea and vomiting 3-5 times daily, affect eating, needed to treat), and CINV (uncontrollable
nausea and vomiting, more than 5 times) were reported in articles. The main characteristics of the
involved studies are presented in Table 1.

Assessing Risk of Methodologic Quality
The detail of the risk-of-bias assessment was summarized in supplemental data 4. Except for
Sandip 2017[19], all studies were open-label randomized study and assessed as high risk in
allocation concealment. Four studies[12, 19, 20, 27] reported the detail of the randomized method,
and the low risk was designated. Incomplete outcome data and selective reporting for all studies
were assessed as low risk. In all, the overall methodologic quality was accepted.

The Efficacy of Olanzapine for Prevention and Treatment of Delayed CINV
As shown in figure 1, eleven RCTs (1107 cancer patients) reported delayed CINV, and
significant heterogeneity (I2=68%, P<0.1) was conducted, so a random model was used. There
was significant lower rate of delayed CINV (RR=0.50, 95%CI: 0.38-0.66, P<0.01) when
olanzapine was added in 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone. Six articles (table 2) reported the level of
delayed CINV, and statistically significant CINV
(RR= 0.27, 95%CI: 0.14-0.52, P<0.01) and
CINV (RR= 0.16, 95%CI: 0.04-0.60, P<0.01) were significantly decreased in olanzapine group.
Subgroup analysis (table 3) shown that there was no statistical difference between 5mg and 10mg
of olanzapine for delayed CINV.

The AEs of Olanzapine for Prevention and Treatment of CINV
There were 7 AEs (dizzy, constipation, somnolence, anorexia, fatigue, insomnia and thirst)
including in this systematic review to quantitative analysis, and anorexia and thirst found
significant heterogeneity, so the random model was used. The rest of AEs did not detect
significant heterogeneity, and a fixed model was used in this review. As shown in table 4, except
for insomnia, the RR is 0.12 (95%CI: 0.06-0.26, P<0.01), all AEs were not conducted statistical
difference between two groups. The results of subgroup analysis are following.
Dizzy
5 studies reported the dizzy events, no significant heterogeneity (I2=0.0%, P=0.97) was
conducted, so fixed model was used. As showed in table 4, no significant difference was found
between two groups (RR=1.14, 95%CI: 0.66-1.98, P=0.65), and the subgroup analysis shown that
no statistical difference between olanzapine 10mg and 5mg (table 3).

Constipation
7 studies included in this review, and fixed model was used (I2=0.0%, P=0.25), and the rate
of constipation was comparable (RR=1.13, 95%CI: 0.87-1.46, P=0.35) between two groups. No
significant difference was detected by the subgroup analysis (table 3).
Anorexia
2 studies reported the data of anorexia, and significant heterogeneity (I2=68.1%, P=0.08) was
found, so random model was used. The RR of anorexia was 1.73 (95%CI: 0.13-23.60, P=0.68),
subgroup analysis was not conducted, because only one study in two groups.

Somnolence
4 studies reported the data of somnolence, and fixed model (I2=0.0%, P=0.61), and result
showed that no significant difference was found (RR=1.20, 95%CI: 0.63-2.77, P=0.58), subgroup
analysis did not found significant difference between 10mg and 5mg (table 3).
Fatigue
4 studies reported the fatigue events, no significant heterogeneity (I2=42.2%, P=0.85) was
conducted, so fixed model was used. As showed in table 4, no significant difference was fund
(RR=0.94, 95%CI: 0.61-1.43, P=0.76). All studies used 5mg olanzapine per day, so subgroup
analysis was not conducted.
Insomnia
2 studies included in this review, and fixed model was used (I2=0.0%, P=0.45). As showed in
table 4, the percentage of insomnia was significant lower in olanzapine group (RR=0.12, 95%CI:
0.06-0.26, P<0.01). Because of only two studies was involved, subgroup analysis was not
conducted.
Thirst
2 studies reported the data of somnolence, and random model (I2=50.5%, P=0.16), and result
showed that no significant difference was found (RR=1.24, 95%CI: 0.65-2.12, P=0.60). Because
of only two studies was involved, subgroup analysis was not conducted.

The Efficacy of Olanzapine for Prevention and Treatment of Acute CINV
As shown in figure 2, 10 RCTs (990 cancer patients) provided the data of acute CINV, no
statistically significant difference was conducted, and fixed model was used. The overall pooled
RR of acute CINV was 0.60 (95%CI: 0.48–0.75, P<0.01). 6 articles (table 2) reported the level of
acute CINV, while only CINV (RR= 0.26, 95%CI: 0.13-0.54, P<0.01) and CINV (RR= 0.17,
95%CI: 0.04-0.73, P=0.02) conducted statistically significant difference. Subgroup analysis (table
3) shown that no statistical difference between 5mg and 10mg of olanzapine for acute CINV was
conducted.

Publication Bias
The publication bias of our meta-analysis was assessed using Beeg and Egger regression
[28, 29], and evidence of publication bias was found from the statistical tests (Begg’s test,
P=0.02, Egger’s test, P<0.01).

Discussion
Eleven studies with 1107 cancer patients were involved in this review, and the result shows that
olanzapine combined with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone is more effect and less insomnia
compared with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone for the prevention and treatment of CINV in high
and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Compared with 10mg per day, 5mg oral may be more
appropriate for cancer patients.

delayed CINV: 26.2% vs. 57.6%), the possible reason may below: 1) our review involved high
and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and Rudolph et al only include high emetogenic
chemotherapy; 2) compared with Rudolph et al, the time of 5-HT3 RA and dexamethasone were
longer (4-5 days vs. 1 day), and rate of CINV would be significant declined. More studies are
warranted.
Two different olanzapine dosage was used in this review, and subgroup analysis shows that
both doses of 10 mg and 5 mg olanzapine provided comparably significant improvement in acute
and delayed CINV. The phase
trial by Yanai et al[14]even find 5mg had a higher complete
control in delayed CINV compared with 10mg (83.1% vs. 77.6%). Because olanzapine may lead
to central nervous system depression, especially in elderly and debilitated patients[31], so 5 mg
per day of olanzapine is more suitable for cancer patients.
Polled analysis is conducted in 7 AEs (dizzy, constipation, somnolence, anorexia, fatigue,
insomnia and thirst) in this systematic review, and incidence of insomnia (RR=0.12, 95%CI:
0.06-0.26, P<0.01) is significantly lower in olanzapine groups. Insomnia is the most common AE
of dexamethasone[32], olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that may lead drowsiness[33],
so the patients with cancer had lower insomnia when olanzapine combined with NK-1 RA and
dexamethasone. At the same time, olanzapine is not increased the incidence of somnolence, while
no studies reported the severity and duration of AEs. Our further RCT about olanzapine combine
tropisetron and dexamethasone for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting induced
by
chemotherapy
of
patients
with
lung
cancer
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03571126?term=20180520&rank=1) concentrate on the
level of AEs, and this concern may be solved. Subgroup analysis showed that there is no
significant difference between 5mg and 10mg in dizzy, constipation and somnolence, so 5mg may
be more appropriate. Previous phase 3 trial[5] found that there are no serious adverse events
related to olanzapine, and no patient discontinued olanzapine because of toxic effects. Therefore
olanzapine is safety in control CINV.
For the first time, we analyzed the level of CINV that is most concerned by patients and
doctors, and the result shows that CINV

Ⅲ

and CINV

Ⅳ

is significantly decreased when

olanzapine were used. Besides, this review is less bias than previous studies [9, 10, 15, 34],
because the intervention measure is more consistent in all involved articles, and we analyzed the
efficacy and adverse AEs of olanzapine combined with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone compared
with 5-HT3 RA plus dexamethasone. Finally, our review involved the largest samples (1107
cancer patients) based on RCTs, so a higher level of evidence may be conducted. However,
limitations also existed in this review. Not all studies reported the whole AEs, and the grade of
AEs was not reported in included articles, the ongoing RCT conducted by our team will report
relevant data. Besides, different types and dosage 5-HT3 RA were used in this review, and the
efficacy and AEs was not all comparable between different type 5-HT3 RA[35], so potential bias
may exsited. Finally, the use time of antiemetic drug and usage of dexamethasone were also not
all consistent, which would affect the results in some degree.
In conclusion, olanzapine significant decreases the occurrence of CINV and and insomnia
for the prevention and treatment of CINV in high and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.
Compared with 10mg per day, 5mg oral may be more appropriate for cancer patients. There is
uncertainty about the severity and duration of AEs.
