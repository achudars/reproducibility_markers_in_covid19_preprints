Abstract
Type 2 diabetes has become alarmingly prevalent among youth in recent years.
However, simple questionnaire-based screening tools to reliably identify diabetes risk
and prevent the adverse effects of this serious disease are only available for adults, not
for youth. As a first step in developing such a tool, we used a large-scale dataset from
the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), to examine the
performance of a well-known adult diabetes risk self-assessment screener and
published pediatric clinical screening guidelines in identifying youth with prediabetes/diabetes (pre-DM/DM) based on American Diabetes Association diagnostic
biomarkers. We assessed the agreement between the adult screener/pediatric
screening guidelines and biomarker diagnostic criteria by conducting comparisons using
the overall data set and sub-datasets stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and age. While the
pediatric guidelines performed better than the adult screener in identifying youth with
pre-DM/DM (sensitivity 43.1% vs 7.2%), both are inadequate for general deployment
among youth. There were also notable differences in the performance of the pediatric
guidelines across subgroups based on age, sex and race/ethnicity. In an effort to
improve pre-DM/DM screening, we also evaluated data-driven machine learning-based

better than the pediatric screening guidelines.

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious chronic condition associated with numerous
long-term complications, including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, kidney disease,
eye disorders, poor wound healing, hearing impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease.1 The
total estimated cost of diabetes in the U.S. in 2017 was $327 billion, including direct
medical costs and those associated with reduced productivity.2 Pre-diabetes (pre-DM) is
a precursor condition in which glucose levels are high, but not yet high enough to
diagnose diabetes.3 Unlike DM, pre-DM is reversible with lifestyle modification and
weight loss, offering an avenue to avoid the adverse effects of diabetes 3-5 Both these
conditions have become alarmingly prevalent among youth in recent years.6,7 According
to a large prospective cohort study, an estimated 5,300 youth age 10 to 19 are newly
diagnosed with type 2 DM annually in the US,6 with a higher prevalence among older
teens than younger ones.7 The overall prevalence of pre-DM among US adolescents
based on nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutritional
Examination Survey (NHANES) was 17.7%, with higher rates in males (22.0%) than
females (13.2%).8 Pre-DM prevalence was also higher in non-Hispanic Blacks (21.0%)
and Hispanics (22.9%) than in non-Hispanic Whites (15.1%), highlighting a racial
disparity challenge as well.8 Compared to adults, DM diagnosed in youth is more
difficult to treat 9 due to a more rapidly progressive decline in beta cell function, and an
earlier onset of complications.10,11 The potential health and economic impact of DM is
therefore even greater for youth than adults, given the greater number of years living
with the disease and time to develop long-term complications.
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has published guidelines for the
diagnosis of pre-DM and DM among youth.12 A two hour oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), including measurement of plasma glucose levels after an overnight fast (FPG),
and again two hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load (2hrPG), is used to diagnose preDM and DM based on predefined cutoffs.12 DM is diagnosed when FPG>126 mg/dL
and/or 2hrPG>200 mg/dL, while pre-DM is diagnosed when FPG is 100-125 mg/dL
(impaired fasting glucose) and/or 2hrPG is 140-199 mg/dL (impaired glucose tolerance).
In 2010, the ADA expanded diagnostic guidelines to three biomarkers, namely FPG,
2hrPG, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).12 Although the ADA acknowledges the limited
data supporting use of HbA1c alone for diagnosing pre-DM and DM in children and
adolescents,12 the association highlights several reasons to consider its use. These
include wide availability, ability to perform the test at any time of the day, increased
provider adherence to screening recommendations compared to OGTT, and lesser dayto-day variations due to factors like stress or illness.5,13
In spite of these diagnostic guidelines, pre-DM and DM are often underdiagnosed
among youth, as many affected individuals have no or few symptoms.14 For example,
one study found that only 1% of adolescents with pre-DM based on elevated HbA1c or
fasting glucose reported having been told by a physician that they had the condition.15

In addition, despite professional consensus on recommended preventive
care for adolescents, many youth do not receive annual checkups, and receipt of
preventive services remains suboptimal.16,17 Even for those in care, OGTT is not
conducted by most general pediatricians.18,19 Furthermore, OGTT requires fasting and
testing over 2-3 hours, which is often challenging,20,21 especially in communities most at
risk for pre-DM/DM.8 Thus, many youth with pre-DM/DM may be unaware of their
condition, making it difficult to target the highest risk youth for prevention. A simple noninvasive, questionnaire-based screening tool is therefore a likely impactful first-line
strategy to identify at-risk individuals before subjecting them to definitive testing and
resource-intense prevention programs.22-25
Several such risk assessment tools have been developed to detect the risk of
prevalent (undiagnosed) and incident pre-DM and DM in adults.26-33 For example, the
ADA and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have developed an easy-to-use, costeffective patient self-assessment screener based on 7 questions to identify adults at risk
for pre-DM and DM.34,35 Those determined to be at risk can then follow up with a
physician for formal clinical diagnosis with an OGTT and/or hemoglobin A1c test.12
Surprisingly, despite the clinical and public health importance of accurately screening
for pre-DM/DM risk among youth, there exists no similar readily available screening tool
for this purpose. The most widely used clinical screening guidelines for health care
providers to test asymptomatic children and adolescents were published by the ADA
and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).12 These pediatric clinical
screening guidelines state that children over 10 years of age, or those who have
entered puberty (even if younger than 10 years), should be considered at high risk for
pre-DM/DM if they are overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 85th percentile) and have two or more
additional risk factors (Table 1).12 However, these guidelines have not been validated
using large population health data sets and ADA diagnostic guidelines in youth.12
Furthermore, such screening guidelines may not perform equally in different age, sex
and race/ethnicity subgroups.36
To address these gaps in our knowledge, we used a large-scale dataset from
NHANES37, to: 1) examine the performance of the adult ADA/CDC patient selfassessment screener in identifying youth with pre-DM/DM based on ADA diagnostic
guidelines (elevated FPG, 2hrPG, or HbA1c), and 2) examine the performance of the
AAP/ADA pediatric clinical screening guidelines in identifying pre-diabetic youth based
on diagnostic guidelines, and examine how these screening guidelines perform in age,
sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups. While NHANES data have been used to assess the
prevalence of pre-DM and DM in both adults and youth,8,38,39 no studies have used
NHANES data to test the performance of existing pre-DM/DM pediatric clinical
screening guidelines. Furthermore, recent work in various biomedical and other
domains have shown that hypothesis-free data-driven machine learning (ML) methods
40,41
can help develop predictive models that can improve disease diagnosis, prognosis,
and treatment efficacy.42-47 Inspired by these advances, we also investigated if ML
methods applied to NHANES data can help improve pre-DM/DM screening
performance.

We utilized publicly available data from NHANES, an ongoing cross-sectional
national survey that systematically gathers data from interviews, physical examinations,
and laboratory testing, and is used to study a range of health topics.37,48 Using a
complex, multi-stage probability cluster sampling design, this survey reflects a nationally
representative sample of the US non-institutionalized population. NHANES also
oversamples certain subgroups, such as African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, older
adults, and low income populations, to achieve reliable and precise estimates of health
status indicators for these groups. Since 1999, NHANES data have been released to
the public on a bi-annual cycle, with approximately 10,000 new people in each survey
wave.
The sample used in this study consists of youth aged 12 to 19 years at the time
of being surveyed. We combined NHANES data from 6 survey cycles for which preDM/DM biomarker data were available: 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012,
2013-2014, and 2015-2016.49 The survey response rates for each cycle for individuals
ages 12 through 19 years were approximately 82.1%, 83.6%, 85.0%, 76.1%, 76.5%,
and 64.3%, respectively. We only included participants for whom pre-DM/DM status
could be determined based on FPG, 2hrPG, and HbA1c (n=2970). We excluded data
from 112 participants that lacked information on BMI percentile, family history of
diabetes, blood pressure measures or total cholesterol, thus making it impossible to
apply the AAP/ADA screening guidelines, resulting in a final sample size of 2858.
Diagnostic Tests Used to Classify Pre-diabetes/Diabetes Status
We identified youth from NHANES with pre-DM or DM based on current ADA
diagnostic guidelines (elevated levels in any of the three biomarkers: FPG ≥100 mg/dL,
2hrPG ≥140 mg/dL, or HbA1C≥ 5.7%).12 Serum specimen collection and processing
procedures for these biomarkers followed the NHANES quality assurance and control
(QA/QC) protocols that have been detailed elsewhere.50-52 Briefly, the biomarker
samples were obtained during the morning examination session after a 9-hour fast.
After FPG was obtained, participants were asked to drink a calibrated dose of TrutolTM
(~75 g glucose), and plasma glucose was again assessed two hours after the oral
glucose load was administered.53 Glucose levels were determined by a hexokinase
method,54 while HbA1c was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.55
Risk-based Screening to Identify Individuals with Pre-diabetes and Diabetes
We applied both the ADA/CDC adult self-assessment screener and the
AAP/ADA pediatric clinical screening guidelines using variables available in NHANES
(Tables 1 and 2). We then evaluated their performance in determining pre-DM/DM
status when compared to the determinations using the ADA diagnostic biomarkers
(elevated FPG, 2hrPG, or HbA1c). Both the adult screener and the AAP/ADA guidelines
include weight status, family history of diabetes, hypertension status, and history of
gestational diabetes (history of maternal gestational diabetes for the youth screening
guidelines). We calculated BMI percentiles using the SAS program provided by the
CDC .56 Since NHANES does not ask children directly about family history of type 2
diabetes in first- or second-degree relatives, we used the response to the question,
“[Have you/Has SP] ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that [you
have/s/he has] health conditions or a medical or family history that increases

[your/his/her] risk for diabetes?”, to assess family history of diabetes. We calculated
blood pressure percentiles for children (<18 years) based on the 2017 Clinical Practice
Guidelines from the AAP using the recommended published SAS program.57,58 We
defined hypertension using blood pressure cutoffs according to the 2017 guidelines
(≥90th percentile or ≥120/80 mmHg for children <13 years, and ≥120/80 for those ≥13
years).57 Information about personal/maternal history of gestational diabetes was not
available for children, and was thus not included. The AAP/ADA pediatric clinical
screening guidelines also include other symptoms or conditions related to insulin
resistance, namely dyslipidemia, presence of acanthosis nigricans, prior diagnosis of
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and small-for-gestational-age birth weight. We
defined dyslipidemia as elevated total cholesterol level (≥170 mg/dL) according to AAP
guidelines.59 Although NHANES also included measurement of serum cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL), we did not use it to define dyslipidemia due to substantial
amounts of missing data. We were not able to find variables related to acanthosis
nigricans, PCOS, or birth weight in NHANES data, and thus did not include these
variables. The adult ADA/CDC screener also includes a question about physical activity.
We defined a child as physically active if he/she had any of the following responses to
questions from the physical activity questionnaire (PAQ) in NHANES: Times per week
play or exercise hard (≥ 1 hour); Days physically active at least 60 min (≥1); Vigorous
work activity (yes); Moderate work activity (yes); Days walk or bicycle (>1); Vigorous
recreational activities (Yes); Moderate recreational activities (Yes); Muscle
strengthening activities (Yes); Tasks around home/yard (Yes); average level of physical
activity each day (>not much).
Assessment of the Performance of the Adult pre-DM/DM Screener and Pediatric
Screening Guidelines
As the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the performance of the adult
ADA/CDC screener and the AAP/ADA pediatric clinical screening guidelines in
identifying pre-DM/DM, not to make population level estimates of disease prevalence,
we did not apply survey procedures to the NHANES data and reported the unweighted
results. Analyses were conducted in SAS (v9.4). We applied McNemar’s test to assess
the agreement between determinations of pre-DM/DM status made by the adult
screener/pediatric screening guidelines and the ADA biomarker diagnostic criteria, and
also reported Kappa coefficients (lower value indicates lower agreement). We
conducted these assessments on the overall NHANES data set collected in our study,
as well as sub-datasets stratified by sex (male, female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, other), and age groups (12-14 years, 15-17 years,
and 18-19 years). We also tested whether the agreement between the pediatric
screening guidelines and the biomarker diagnostic criteria (i.e. the marginal
homogeneity) differed across subgroups using the Breslow-Day test and test for equal
Kappa coefficients.
Machine Learning to Classify pre-DM/DM Status
As alternatives to expert-defined screeners, we also explored automated
algorithms from machine learning 41 for developing pre-DM/DM classifiers directly from
the youth NHANES data. The goal of these algorithms is to automatically infer a
mathematical function that can categorize individuals, described in terms of relevant

features, into classes, here pre-DM/DM or not. Due to the higher relevance of the
AAP/ADA pediatric clinical screening guidelines to youth pre-DM/DM, we used the
same five variables used in these guidelines, namely continuous BMI percentiles, family
history of diabetes (yes/no), race ethnicity (non-Hispanic white vs otherwise),
hypertension (yes/no), and continuous total cholesterol levels, as features for
developing these classifiers. The algorithms we considered for this purpose were
AdaBoost(M1), LogitBoost, Naïve Bayes, Logistic (Regression), Support Vector
Machine (SMO), Voted Perceptron, K-nearest neighbor (IBk), PART and J48 decision
tree inference algorithms, and Random Forest 41. Their implementations in the Weka
ML toolkit 60, incorporated into our DataSink pipeline 61, were used with their default
parameter values in Weka. Since these implementations produce probabilistic
predictions, we used the value of the probability score that yields the highest value of
balanced accuracy, the mean of specificity and sensitivity 62, as the threshold to convert
them into binary predictions to be comparable with the screening test results. All these
ML algorithms were tested in a five-fold cross-validation (CV) setup 63, where in each
CV round, 80% of the data were used to train candidate classifiers, which were then
used to make pre-DM/DM predictions on the remaining 20% of the data. To address the
imbalance between the pre-DM/DM and non-pre-DM/DM classes in the data (Table 3),
which can adversely affect the classifiers 64, our framework balanced the two classes by
randomly under-sampling the majority class during training 64, while retaining the
distribution in the test fold exactly the same. Repeating this process over the whole
dataset, and collecting the predictions for all five subsets of the data created during CV,
generated dataset-wide predictions from all the algorithms, which were then evaluated
as described below.
Evaluation of pre-DM/DM Status Determined by Clinical Screeners and Machine
Learning-based Classifiers
Both the adult ADA/CDC screener and the pediatric clinical screening guidelines,
as well as the ML algorithms described above, produce binary classifications,
specifically positive (+) for pre-DM/DM determinations, and negative (-) for non-preDM/DM ones. Although several measures are known for evaluating such classifications
against true labels 65, determined here based on ADA biomarker measurements, the
most commonly used measures like accuracy and AUC score are not ideal for our data.
For instance, since only about 30% of the youth in the NHANES population considered
in our study are pre-DM/DM cases, one can get an artificially high accuracy value of
about 70% just by classifying all the individuals as not having pre-DM/DM, which is
obviously not useful. The AUC score, which is designed for continuous predictions, not
binary ones, and thus isn’t directly applicable in our case, is also not informative in
cases of class imbalance like ours66.
Based on these considerations, we focused on evaluation measures that have
been designed for and shown to be the most relevant for classifier evaluation in the
case of unbalanced classes 66. Specifically, we used six measures 65 to evaluate the
correctness of the pre-DM/DM predictions from the screening guidelines and ML
methods: sensitivity (recall+), specificity (recall-), positive predictive value (PPV,
precision+), negative predictive value (NPV, precision-), and F-measures for the two
classes (see Table 4 for detailed definitions of these measures). Another advantage of

these measures, as compared to accuracy and AUC score, is that they provide perclass performance assessment, which can reveal if the classifier is biased in favor of a
particular class, which is likely in the case of unbalanced classes66.
Finally, we conducted the recommended Friedman and Nemenyi tests 67 to
assess the statistical significance of the comparisons of the predictive performances of
all the ML methods tested, as well as that of the pediatric screening guidelines.
Results
Study population: Descriptive demographic and clinical characteristics of the 2858 youth
in the study population are presented in Table 3.
Comparisons of pre-DM/DM status obtained from adult screener/pediatric screening
guidelines against pre-DM/DM determinations using biomarker diagnostic criteria: The
number and percentages of youth in our study population found to have pre-DM/DM
according to the ADA/CDC adult screener and the AAP/ADA pediatric clinical screening
guidelines are shown in Table 3. We found poor agreement between the pre-DM/DM
determinations based on biomarker criteria and the adult screener (McNemar’s test pvalue<0.0001, Kappa coefficient 0.07 (95%CI: 0.04-0.09)), as well as between those
based on biomarker criteria and the pediatric clinical screening guidelines (McNemar’s
test p<0.0001, Kappa coefficient 0.1 (95%CI: 0.06-0.14)).
Predictive performance of the adult ADA/CDC screener and the AAP/ADA
pediatric clinical screening guidelines are shown in Table 4. The top part of the table
shows the contingency tables detailing these comparisons, while the bottom part lists
the variety of performance measures derived from these tables. These measures were
chosen because of their relevance to cases where the classes (pre-DM/DM or not) are
unbalanced, and thus, more routinely used measures like accuracy and AUC may not
be informative.68 The adult screener performed poorly in identifying youth with preDM/DM (sensitivity=7.2%, specificity=97.7%; Table 4). The performance of the pediatric
guidelines was better, as it correctly identified 43.1% of the youth with pre-DM/DM
based on biomarkers; the PPV (precision+) was 35.2%, and the pre-DM/DM F-measure
was 38.8% (Table 4).
Assessment of clinical screening guidelines’ performance across demographic
subgroups: The agreement between the pediatric clinical screening guidelines and the
biomarker criteria in defining pre-DM/DM status differed significantly for males and
females (Breslow-Day Test p=0.02), and had a borderline statistically significant
difference across the three age groups (Breslow-Day Test p=0.046), but did not differ
across the four racial/ethnic groups (Breslow-Day Test p=0.42). The Kappa coefficients
did not differ significantly across all the subgroups (p>0.05).
Figure 1 shows variations in the predictive performance measures of the clinical
screening guidelines across the various subgroups studied. The sensitivity (recall+) of
the clinical screening guidelines in identifying pre-DM/DM was higher among females
than males (52.2% vs 38.2%), while the PPV (precision+) was lower among females
(29.4% vs 41.1%). The guidelines performed better for Hispanics and non-Hispanic
Blacks than for non-Hispanic Whites and other racial/ethnic groups in terms of

sensitivity (51.8% and 51.9% vs 23.4% and 32.5%), while the PPV was similar (28.8%37.6%) across the four racial/ethnic groups. Finally, the guidelines performed the worst
for those aged 12-14 years (sensitivity=39.9%) and the best for those aged 18-19 years
(sensitivity=47.8%, PPV=30.2%, and F-measure=43.7%).
Machine learning to classify pre-diabetes: Figure 2 shows the five-fold cross-validationderived results of classifying pre-DM/DM status using ML algorithms, variables used in
the pediatric screening guidelines, and class labels (pre-DM/DM or not) defined using
the ADA biomarker diagnostic guidelines. It can be seen from these results that, across
almost all the algorithms and evaluation measures, it is comparatively easier to produce
more accurate predictions for the non-pre-DM/DM class than the pre-DM/DM one. This
is primarily due to the smaller number of pre-DM/DM-diagnosed individuals that can
contribute to the inference of the ML-based predictive models. Even so, the overall
performance varies in a manner consistent with that of the clinical screening guidelines
across the measures and classes. Furthermore, in each case, at least one ML algorithm
performed statistically significantly better than the screening guidelines, especially for
the harder to predict pre-DM/DM class. In particular, the Naïve Bayes classifier
performed equivalently or significantly better as compared to the screening guidelines in
terms of all the measures for this class (Friedman-Nemenyi test p=9.216x10-5, 0.252
and 5.228x10-5 for PPV, sensitivity and F-measure respectively). This classifier also
performed significantly better than the screening guidelines for the non-pre-DM/DM
class (Friedman-Nemenyi test p=8.5x10-10, 0.013 and 0.005 for NPV, specificity and Fmeasure respectively). Several other algorithms, such as Logistic (Regression),
LogitBoost, PART and J48 (decision tree), also performed statistically equivalently or
significantly better than the screening guidelines.
Overall, these results show that even with very few features (only five here),
data-driven ML-based methods can help improve upon the performance of traditional
pre-DM/DM screening guidelines.
Discussion
While there are simple, non-invasive, questionnaire-based patient selfassessment tools to identify adults at-risk for pre-DM/DM, no such tools exist for youth.
The increasing incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes among
youth in recent years, and the under-diagnosis of these conditions despite serious longterm sequelae, point to a pressing need for the development of simple accurate
screening tools for identifying at-risk youth. Application of these tools can guide
patients, families, and providers in conducting follow-up clinical tests for definitive
diagnosis and targeting resource-intense diabetes prevention programs. Towards that
end, we used NHANES data to evaluate the performance of an existing adult screening
tool recommended by the ADA and CDC, as well as current pediatric clinical screening
guidelines recommended by the AAP and ADA, against diagnosis of pre-DM/DM based
on ADA biomarker diagnostic criteria (elevated FPG/2hrPG/HbA1C). In addition, given
the differences in the prevalence of pre-DM/DM among youth based on race/ethnicity,
age, and sex, we examined the performance of the clinical screening guidelines among
youth from different subgroups based on these demographic characteristics. Overall,

these two screeners did not perform well in identifying youth with pre-DM/DM, and there
were notable differences in the performance of the clinical screening guidelines across
the above demographic subgroups.
The poor performance of the adult ADA/CDC screener in identifying youth with preDM/DM is not unexpected, as the screener was developed for the adult population. The
below 10% sensitivity of this screener found in our study for youth stood in contrast with
a much higher sensitivity (about 80%) found in studies evaluating the screener on adult
NHANES data.34,69,70 Other adult screeners that include many of the same criteria as
the ADA/CDC screener (and some additional criteria such as waist circumference and
fruit/vegetable intake) have also been shown to perform well in adults based on
evaluation of NHANES data.71-73 However, these screeners were also not developed for
youth, highlighting the need to develop a simple questionnaire-based screener
specifically for the youth population.
Despite the fact that the AAP/ADA pediatric clinical screening guidelines are meant for
health care providers to identify youth at risk for diabetes, the sensitivity of these
guidelines in identifying NHANES youth with pre-DM/DM was still below 50%. In
addition, as there are significant disparities in youth pre-DM/DM with higher rates
among racial/ethnic minorities, males, and older adolescents, it is important to
accurately identify risk in different demographic subgroups. Use of the unweighted
NHANES data, although not nationally representative, offers an advantage here, since
NHANES oversamples racial/ethnic minority populations which have higher rates of preDM and DM. We found that the clinical guidelines performed slightly better in females
than males, and across age groups, while the performance didn’t differ significantly
across race/ethnicity subgroups. Other studies have examined the performance of risk
tools across sex, race/ethnicity, and age, and have found differences in performance
across the corresponding subgroups.36,74,75 One study that examined the performance
of an adult diabetes risk tool across sex and race/ethnicity found that the tool performed
better in women than in men and in non-Hispanic Whites than in Hispanics in detecting
undiagnosed pre-DM/DM.36 This points to the need to evaluate the performance of risk
tools in different demographic subgroups and perhaps develop different subgroupspecific tools.
Data-driven ML-based algorithms yielded slight but statistically significant improvements
in identifying youth with pre-DM/DM, despite using only five variables (BMI, family
history of diabetes, race/ethnicity, hypertension, and cholesterol levels). Combining
many more relevant features from NHANES or other large data sets with rich clinical
and behavioral health data, as well as powerful ML approaches like feature selection76
and deep learning77, is likely to substantially enhance our ability to develop a datadriven, relatively simple, and accurate screener for youth at risk for pre-DM/DM.
Our study has several notable limitations. We defined the diagnosis of pre-DM/DM
based on one-time measurements of biomarkers, whereas the ADA recommends
repeated measurements.12 In addition, our application of the adult ADA/CDC screener
to the youth NHANES data was not perfect, as there were some variables that were

either not available in NHANES (history of gestational DM) or available in a slightly
different format (family history, blood pressure, weight status, and physical activity).
Interpretation of age (all youth were assigned a score of zero for age because the
screener uses adult age group cutoffs (as shown in Table 1) and sex (a score of 1 for
males and 0 for females) may not reflect true age and sex differences affecting youth
pre-DM/DM risk. Similarly, we were not able to exactly apply the AAP/ADA pediatric
clinical screening guidelines because of missing information (history of maternal
gestational diabetes during the child’s gestation, presence of acanthosis nigricans,
diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, and history of small-for-gestational-age
birthweight), or information available in a different format (family history of diabetes).
Also, because the adult screener and the pediatric clinical guidelines are only meant to
identify increased risk of diabetes and not to distinguish risk of pre-DM from risk of DM,
we did not explicitly differentiate between these conditions in our study. Specifically, we
used biomarker cutoffs for pre-DM and examined the ability of existing screener/clinical
guidelines to identify the presence of pre-DM/DM. The benefit of identifying pre-DM in
particular is that, unlike DM, pre-DM is thought to be reversible with lifestyle modification
and weight management.4,5 Thus, accurate identification of pre-DM specifically may
help better target intensive diabetes prevention programs. Furthermore, NHANES data,
and thus, our evaluation did not differentiate type 1 vs type 2 diabetes, although the
prevalence of type 1 diabetes is relatively low among youth compared to that of pre-DM
and type 2 DM.7,8 Finally, we only applied a routinely used set of classification
algorithms that have been developed in machine learning40,41, and our results could
have been improved further by employing other more advanced algorithms.
Despite these limitations, our study also has several strengths. To our knowledge, this
is the first study that examined the performance of a widely used adult diabetes risk
screener, as well as recommended pediatric clinical screening guidelines, in identifying
pre-DM/DM status, determined using biomarker diagnostic criteria, among youth. Our
demonstration that neither of these tools performed well for this task points to the need
for additional work to develop a simple yet accurate screener for youth diabetes risk.
Studies to date that have focused on assessing youth pre-DM/DM risk have relied on
small sample sizes from localized clinical settings, and have sometimes included
invasive blood tests that may not be the best initial strategy to identify risk.78,79 In
contrast, NHANES includes a large sample of individuals from across the United States,
including well-represented age, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups, as well as detailed
biomarker, clinical, and behavioral health data. While NHANES data have been used to
develop diabetes risk screeners for adults,34,70,71 and to examine prevalence of preDM/DM among youth,8,80 no studies to date have used these data to develop and
evaluate youth diabetes risk screeners. In particular, our investigation of machine
learning methods applied to these data demonstrates the promise of automated datadriven methods for developing such screeners. Future work includes the use of more
advanced ML methods to a wider range of clinical and behavioral health data available
in NHANES to build better predictive tools for discriminating pre-DM/DM status. Such
tools may be used by youth or their caretakers (parents, teachers, etc.), as well as in
clinical and community settings to identify at-risk youth who can benefit from more
intensive diabetes prevention programs.

Notes: , We calculated blood pressure percentiles for children (<18 years) based on the 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines from the AAP using the recommended
published SAS program.57,58
‡
, We defined a child as physically active if he/she had any of the following responses to questions from the physical activity questionnaire (PAQ) in NHANES:
Times per week play or exercise hard (≥ 1 hour); Days physically active at least 60 min (≥1); Vigorous work activity (yes); Moderate work activity (yes); Days walk
or bicycle (>1); Vigorous recreational activities (Yes); Moderate recreational activities (Yes); Muscle strengthening activities (Yes); Tasks around home/yard (Yes);
average level of physical activity each day (>not much).
