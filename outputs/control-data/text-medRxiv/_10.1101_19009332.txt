ABSTRACT
PURPOSE: To evaluate visual acuity (VA) outcomes of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in diabetic macular oedema (DMO).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic medical records for all patients
undergoing intravitreal injections (IVI) in a tertiary referral centre between March 2013 and
October 2018 were analysed. Treatment response in terms of visual acuity outcomes were
reported for all eyes over a 4-year observation period.
RESULTS: Our cohort includes 2616 DMO eyes of 1965 patients over 48 months. Cox
proportional hazards modelling identified injection number (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18), male
gender (HR = 1.13), and baseline VA (HR = 1.09) as independent predictors to reach a
favorable visual outcome of more than 70 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
(ETDRS) letters. Half of our cohort reached 70 letters 1.9 months after starting anti-VEGF
therapy. Of those that reached 70 letters, 50% fell below 70 by 14.7 months.
CONCLUSION: To date, this is the largest single centre cohort study and over the longest
observation period reporting on real-life outcomes of anti-VEGF in DMO. We have made an
anonymised version of our dataset available on an open-source data repository as a
resource for all clinical researchers globally.

INTRODUCTION
There are currently 21 million patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) worldwide, which is
expected to increase with the projected prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) from 415
million in 2015 to 642 million in 2040.​[1]​ The overall risk of diabetic macular oedema (DMO)
in patients with DM is currently estimated at 7% (and at 29% after 20 years of disease
duration), thus establishing it as the major cause for moderate vision loss in diabetic
patients.​[2]​ Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that intravitreal
injections (IVI) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents improve the
prognosis of patients with DMO in terms of visual acuity (VA) when following a fixed intervals
treatment regimen.​[3–6]
In generating the evidence base for optimal patient management, analyses of real-world
clinical data have become complements to clinical trials. Evaluation of real-world outcomes
ensures continued endorsement of therapeutics by regulators, payers, clinicians, and
patients. Compared with clinical trials, real-world studies typically feature a larger sample
size and with it, greater heterogeneity amongst its patient cohort and healthcare delivery
systems. Such data enable holistic understanding of a therapeutic as they include a more
accurate representation of the patient cohorts that receive a therapeutic, how it is used, and
the resultant outcome. Notably, treatment conditions in the pivotal anti-VEGF in DMO RCTs
are not reflected in real-life clinical settings. A key example is that real-life practice features
lower injection frequencies when compared to RCTs.​[7–16]​ This is likely due to different
treatment regimens (pro re nata and treat-and-extend) and reduced therapy adherence.
Consequently, visual outcome of daily clinical-practice remains unclear.
Here we report on the largest retrospective cohort of DMO patients (2616 eyes of 1965
patients) receiving anti-VEGF therapy and over the longest observation period (48 months)
to date. Time-to-event analyses and Cox proportional hazards modelling were carried out to
evaluate key positive- (reaching VA of 70 ETDRS letters or greater and remaining above 70)
and negative-visual outcomes (VA loss ≥15). An anonymized version of this dataset and our
analyses will be made available in an open-source digital repository to increase
transparency, accessibility, and permit independent replication of our results. Such
availability also enables our data to contribute toward top tier evidence and greater clinical
impact.

METHODS
STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN
This study is a retrospective cohort study of diabetic patients treated for DMO by anti-VEGF
at a tertiary referral centre - Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. We
obtained approval by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital (ROAD17/031) - Audit
registration was completed (MEH-233). In this study, we complied with the Declaration of
Helsinki and STROBE guidelines for the reporting of cohort studies.​[17]
DATA SOURCE
All clinical information at Moorfields Eye Hospital is recorded within an electronic medical
record (EMR) application (OpenEyes Foundation, London, UK). A SQL database (SQL
Server Reporting Service, Microsoft Corporation, Richmond, USA) containing all the
information from the EMR is in place and regular updates are performed overnight to keep
the data warehouse up-to-date. VA is reported in ETDRS letter score. The highest value
(independent of measurement method) available at each visit was chosen.
PARTICIPANTS
A data-warehouse query for patients that received one IVI for DMO (between March 2013
and October 2018) resulted in 3226 unique eyes from 2368 patients. Exclusion criteria were
those that: (i) suffered from macular oedema secondary to other conditions than diabetes; (ii)
under 18 years old; (iii) received fewer than 3 IVI; (iv) received bevacizumab,
dexamethasone intravitreal implant, or fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant; leaving
2616 eyes of 1965 patients taken forward for analysis.
TREATMENT REGIMEN
Patients that were included in this study received anti-VEGF therapy according to the
recommended National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines at the
injection clinic of Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which is approved by the
Clinical Audit and Effectiveness Committee (​Supplemental Figure 1​).​[18]
STUDY OUTCOMES
The primary study outcome is time-to-event analyses (Kaplan-Meier plot) for absolute VA
attaining 70 ETDRS letters or above and Cox proportional-hazards modelling to identify
predictive covariates. VA was recorded as the best value of the days visit (without correction,
glasses or pinhole). Secondary event outcomes include: time to VA less than 70 (≤ 69) and
time to VA loss ≥ 15. Time-to-event analyses were employed to obviate the survival bias
encountered in traditional visual outcome at given time point metrics (e.g. mean change in

VA at year 2), which typically discounts absent patient data. Moreover, by incorporating all
the available data leading up to missing values in our models for VA outcomes, they ought to
reflect real life more accurately.
To enable comparison with previously published functional outcomes, we also carried out :
(i) mean VA and change in VA per study eye as compared to baseline in ETDRS letters; (ii)
proportion of eyes with change in VA being < 10 ETDRS letters and ≥ 10 ETDRS letters; and
(iii) proportion of eyes with ≥ 15 ETDRS letters gain or loss. For these analyses, selected
observation time-points and their definitions were as follows: baseline (date of first
intravitreal injection); one year (12 months; 365 days ± 90 days); two years (24 months; 720
± 150 days); three years (36 months; 1095 ± 150 days); four years (48 months; 1460 ± 150
days).
STATISTICAL METHODS
For statistical analyses, all EMR data was handled in R.​[19]​ Time to each of the visual
outcomes were visualised with Kaplan-Meier time-event plots. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were also carried out to evaluate the effects of demography (gender,
ethnicity), clinical features at baseline (age and VA), and IVI (included as time-dependent
covariates). Distribution of data was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Means of
non-parametric groups were compared using Wilcoxon Signed-rank, Wilcoxon Rank-sum,
and Kruskal-Wallis tests as appropriate. For more than two groups, multiple
pairwise-analyses was carried out with the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test. Calculated means in
text and figures are expressed with ± error margin corresponding to the standard deviation,
unless otherwise specified. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
DATA SHARING AGREEMENT
An anonymised version of the dataset as well as the code used for analysis is available in
the open source digital repository Dryad - ​https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pzgmsbcfw​.
Depersonalisation was carried out through hash function anonymisation of patient
identification numbers, and replacement of appointment dates with follow-up days to
baseline. Approval of adequate depersonalisation was obtained by Moorfields Information
Governance.

Table 1. Patient demographics, number of eyes observed and visual acuity outcomes.
Eyes were classified to ongoing treatment, observation only, datapoint not available
and treatment duration less than time-point.
At baseline, the mean VA was 61.0 ± 15.3 ETDRS letters. For each of the annual timepoints,
we saw an increasing number of eyes with missing VA values. This was largely due to the
treatment duration for a given patient being shorter than the timepoint itself, leaving few due
to loss-to-follow-up. For instance, of the 1995 eyes without data at the 4-year timepoint, only
2 were lost-to-follow-up with the remainder having a treatment duration less than 4 years.
MEAN VISUAL ACUITY TRENDS ARE SIMILAR TO EXISTING LITERATURE
Trends in VA were compared to previously published studies. Mean VA changes and IVIs
were comparable to retrospective cohort studies at one- and two-year timepoints
(​Supplemental Table 1​). Data for comparison of three- and four-year timepoints do not yet
exist. A change in VA of 10 and 15 letters are frequently considered when evaluating
outcomes in DMO patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy. ​[13,15,20]​ Also in keeping with
reported retrospective studies, the proportion of eyes in this cohort gaining ≥ 10 letters was
greater than 30% and exceeded those who lost ≥ 10 letters at each of the annual time-points
(​Supplemental Figure 3a​).​[13,15,20]​ A similar trend was observed when considering the
proportion of eyes which gained ≥ 15 letters, with 19.3%, 20.5%, 18.9%, and 21.3% of eyes
observed at the annual time-points spanning 1 to 4 years following baseline ​(Supplemental
Figure 3b​).
PREDICTIVE FACTORS FOR POSITIVE VISUAL OUTCOMES
Absolute VA ≥ 70 ETDRS letters is commonly used to measure positive visual outcomes in a
clinical setting. Kaplan-Meier modelling of our cohort data suggests that 50% of DMO eyes
are likely to reach VA ≥ 70 at 1.9 months after starting anti-VEGF therapy and over 75%
after a year (​Figure 1a​). To identify predictive variables for VA ≥ 70 in our cohort, we used
Cox proportional-hazards modelling to relate VA outcomes to clinical time-dependent
(anti-VEGF injections) and time-independent (gender, age at baseline, VA at baseline)

covariates. This suggests that number of IVI, being male and - to a greater extent - VA at
baseline are positively associated with VA ≥ 70 (​Table 2​).

Indeed, the time point at which 50% of people are likely to reach VA ≥ 70 is much sooner in
those with higher baseline VA of 60-69 (2.3 months) than with a lower baseline VA of 36-49
(57.0 months) (​Figure 1b​). In contrast, age at baseline correlates inversely with VA ≥ 70
(​Table 2​) and with a smaller impact on event probability. A small, but statistically significant,

difference in median event time is even seen between patients at either extremes of age 0.9 months in those ≤ 44 years of age compared with 5.1 months in those ≥ 75 (​Figure 1c​).
INTERROGATING DURATION TO VISION LOSS
The majority of our cohort attained the positive clinical outcome of VA ≥ 70 during the 48
month observation period (1995 of 2616 eyes). We subsequently interrogated the duration
for which the VA remained at or above 70 in this sub-cohort by modelling time between
attaining VA ≥ 70 to falling below 70 (≤ 69 letters). Of patients that reach VA ≥ 70, 50% are
likely to fall below 70 at 14.7 months (​Figure 2a​). Statistically significant predictive variables
for falling below 70 after having attained VA ≥ 70 are VA at baseline (​Figure 2b​), age at
baseline (​Figure 2c​), and injection number (​Table 2​). Interestingly, gender does not
contribute significantly to VA falling below 70 as it does for reaching 70.
PREDICTIVE VARIABLES FOR NEGATIVE VISUAL OUTCOMES
A significant loss in vision has often been defined as loss of 15 ETDRS letters in the
research of macular diseases as a synonym for a three lines decline on Snellen chart. It is
also recommended by the FDA as a relevant outcome for studies addressing macular
diseases.​[21]​ We observed a trend of male sex reducing the risk of losing more than 15
ETDRS letters during therapy. Despite the strong effect of HR of 0.88 this predictive factor
was not statistically significant. Independent predictors for losing more than 15 letters were a
low VA at baseline as well as a low number of injections (​Table 2​). As expected, age at
baseline did not contribute as a predictor for unfavorable vision loss. ​[22]

DISCUSSION
MAIN FINDINGS
Here we report on the largest retrospective cohort of DMO patients (2616 eyes of 1965
patients) receiving anti-VEGF therapy and over the longest observation period (4 years) to
date. Reaching VA of 70 ETDRS letters or greater is an indicator of patient independence.
Indeed, it is: (i) used as the mark for low vision alongside visual field loss and loss of
contrast sensitivity; ​[23,24]​ (ii) the threshold for driving; ​[25]​ (iii) the minimum VA required to
read the small print; ​[26]​ and therefore chosen as key positive VA outcome. The majority of
our cohort achieved VA ≥ 70 (76%) over the observation period and were likely do so shortly
after initiating anti-VEGF therapy (median survival at 1.9 months; ​Figure 1​). However, it is
unknown for how long a given eye can expect to remain above this critical level. Our
analyses demonstrate the median survival of this sub-cohort to remain at or above 70 is 14.7
months (​Figure 2​). That is, the VA in 50% of eyes will fall below 70 ETDRS letters 14.7
months after reaching ≥ 70. Baseline VA, baseline age, and IVI number are predictive
covariates for VA reaching and remaining above 70 (​Table 2​). An interpretation of these
data is that early recognition of DMO indicated for treatment can increase the probability of
positive visual outcomes; including VA reaching 70 ETDRS letters and extending the
duration one remains above it. ​[4,5,27]
VISUAL OUTCOMES IN RCTs
Demography and trends in VA of our cohort are consistent to those in similar real-world data
reports in DMO (​Supplemental Table 1​). However, the annual mean VA changes observed
in our cohort were less than those reported in the RCTs that led to approval of the
anti-VEGF treatment (​Table 1​). ​[3–5]​ It has been postulated that these differences in IVI
regimen and number account for this. For instance, the mean IVIs delivered over 24 months
in the RISE (20.9) and RIDE (21.9) studies ​[4]​ are two-fold greater than in any study
reporting real-world data (​Supplemental Table 1​), including ours (8.9; ​Table 1​). Our cohort
analyses support this as they demonstrate IVI as a positive predictive covariate of VA
reaching VA ≥ 70 (HR 1.18 [95%CI 1.14 - 1.22]) and protective for negative VA outcomes VA falling below 70 (HR 0.96 [95%CI 0.93 - 0.99]) and VA loss ≥ 15 (HR 0.98 [95%CI 0.96 1.00]) (​Table 2​). It is important to note that our model represents the Moorfields treatment
protocol and incorporates IVIs as a time-dependent covariate. As such, patients that receive
IVIs could signify greater disease severity. It is notable that IVIs are statistically significant
predictors of positive visual outcomes in spite of this.

Another potential reason for the discrepancy in annual mean VA change between RCTs and
our study is a difference in baseline VA. Our cohort features a greater mean baseline VA
than the RCTs (​Table 1​). It is established that baseline VA is inversely correlated with mean
VA changes at 1 and 2 years in DMO patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy ​[28]​; as is
evident from the broad range of mean baseline VAs (48 to 63) featured in real-world studies
(​Supplemental Table 1​. Interestingly, our model identifies baseline VA as a protective factor
for positive outcomes: VA reaching 70 or more ETDRS letters (HR 1.09 [95% CI 1.09-1.1])
and remaining above 70 (HR=0.97; [0.96-0.97]) (​Table 2​). That is, although those with a low
baseline VA may exhibit a greater VA increase at 1 and 2 years, they are less likely to reach
a positive visual outcome than those with a higher baseline VA.
ADDRESSING MISSING DATA
Loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) is a general and challenging limitation in retrospective cohort data
when evaluating outcomes at given time points. This is also the case in studies looking at
anti-VEGF in DMO. LTFU rates reported in literature are as high as 13%, 31%, 48% and
65% after 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively; and even up to 95% after 2 years in multicentre
analysis. [​ 8,14]​ Our data featured comparable missing data at key time points i.e. 27%, 41%,
60% and 76% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively (​Table 1​). We therefore scrutinised the
underlying reason for missing data by considering the treatment duration for each eye. As
expected, we saw that the majority of missing data (>85% at each time point) were due to
treatment duration being shorter than the time point (​Table 1​). For example, a patient with
DMO initiating treatment in 2018 will not have a value any of the annual time points and it
would be inappropriate to label them as LTFU. Through this consideration alone, our dataset
features the lowest LTFU rate reported amongst similar studies.
We also considered whether values were missing due to patients being deceased and is the
first of such studies to do so. Interestingly, data values from 163 eyes of 102 patients were
absent due to death over a 4 year observation period which extrapolates to 30.6 deaths per
1000 person-years. This is higher than what has been previously reported in DM (26 deaths
per 1000 person-years). ​[29]​ This correlation may be explained over the amount of
comorbidities besides diabetes that are present in the UK population. ​[30]​ Moreover, one
would expect our study cohort (patients receiving hospital treatment for complications of DM)
to be at higher risk of comorbidities than the general DM population.
LIMITATIONS OF OUR DATA
Our dataset attempts to account for missing data and consequently features the lowest
LTFU rate amongst similar studies. Although this is the case, it is important to note that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19009332; this version posted October 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

missing values remain and these would be ignored in traditional time point analyses e.g.
mean change in VA at year 2. Here it would be controversial to assume that patients with
absent data at a given time point (death or otherwise) are a random selection of those that
initiate treatment. As such, survival bias would feature prominently if mean values at given
time points were generalised to all DMO patients that undergo anti-VEGF therapy.
Accordingly, we have employed time-to-event analyses as they use all data up until the point
that someone has an event or no longer followed up. Moreover, time-independent and
-dependent covariates were incorporated to enable adjustment for age, baseline VA, gender,
and injections.
In patients with bilateral DMO involvement and receiving IVIs, both eyes were included in our
analyses. This is a possible confounder as it could lead to multiple-testing. However, this
could be addressed by other workgroups using our open-source dataset.
FUTURE IMPLICATIONS
To date, this is the largest single centre cohort study reporting on real-life outcomes of
anti-VEGF in DMO. There are several similar real-world data reports in DMO (​Supplemental
Table 1​). Of these, our cohort size is larger than six of them combined. Comparable cohort
size have been reported by Egan et al. (2017); a UK wide multicentre study with 19
attending centres and thus various distinct treatment regimes, as opposed to a single
protocol in our single centre study. ​[14]​ Our inclusion criteria are broader than in the pivotal
RCTs, including patients with higher and lower baseline VA, thus granting a more realistic
account of DMO treatment outcomes.
A key output of this study is to make an anonymised version of our dataset available on an
open-source data repository as a resource for all clinical researchers globally. This is with
the aim of optimising the capacity of our data to positively impact clinical research and
outcomes. By including data beyond the two year time horizon, we hope to expand current
insight into long-term visual outcomes by enabling comparison and meta-analysis with future
data that also report beyond two years. There is an increasing call for research that is
transparent and that can have its key findings reproduced by its audience.​[31,32]​ This is of
particular concern in clinical research predicated on digitalisation of healthcare
environments, as collective progress can be hampered by the absence of detailed
methodology and data sharing. To further address this, we have published a step-by-step
guide written in open source code R of how we performed our statistical analyses. This code
can be directly applied to the published database to replicate all figures and values in this
study.

Conclusions
Analyses of our cohort reveal that the majority reach 70 ETDRS letters or more whilst
receiving their initial loading dose. Of these, the median survival for remaining above 70 is
14.7 months. Furthermore, we demonstrate that age, baseline VA, and injection number are
independent predictors of visual outcomes - suggesting that earlier diagnosis and treatment
of DMO could increase the likelihood of positive outcomes. Lastly, this is the largest
retrospective cohort study of anti-VEGF in DMO over the longest observation period to date
and we have made this dataset available.

Figure 1. Time-to-event analysis with outcome being visual acuity greater than or
equal to 70 ETDRS letters. ​Time from starting anti-VEGF injections to visual acuity (VA)
reaching 70 ETDRS (early treatment diabetic retinopathy study) letters or more was

Figure 2. Time-to-event analysis with outcome being visual acuity less than 70 ETDRS
letters. ​All patients attaining visual acuity (VA) equal to or greater than 70 ETDRS (early
treatment diabetic retinopathy study) letters in the observation period were taken forward for
analysis. Date of reaching this threshold was considering baseline, with time to VA falling
below 70 modelled (Top panel). Cohorts were further stratified by statistically significant
predictors (​Table 2​): baseline visual acuity (VA; Middle panel) and age at first injection
(Bottom panel). Of note, the sub-cohort of patients that began with VA at or over 70 (Red
line; Middle panel) were included in sub-stratified by baseline VA and featured median event
time almost two-fold greater than the other sub-cohorts.
