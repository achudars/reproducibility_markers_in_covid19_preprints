Abstract

21

Background

22

Independent investigations demonstrate greater radiofrequency (RF) ablation effects at left-

23

sided left atrial posterior wall (LAPW) sites.

24

Objective

25

To investigate mechanisms underlying RF ablation heterogeneity during contact-force (CF)

26

and VISITAG™ Module (Biosense Webster)-guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).

27

Methods

28

Consecutive patients undergoing PVI during atrial overdrive pacing comprised 2 cohorts:

29

intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV, 14-16/min, 6-8ml/kg); high frequency jet

30

ventilation (HFJV, 150/min, Monsoon III, Acutronic). Temperature-controlled (17ml/min,

31

48oC) RF data was retrospectively assessed at first-annotated (target 15s) LAPW sites: 30W

32

during IPPV; 20W at left-sided sites during HFJV.

33

Results

34

Twenty-five and 15 patients underwent PVI during IPPV and HFJV, respectively. During

35

IPPV, left versus right-sided median impedance drop (ImpD) was 13.6Ω versus 9.9Ω

36

(p<0.0001) respectively and mean time to pure R unipolar electrogram (UE) morphology

37

change 4.9s versus 6.7s (p=0.007) respectively. During HFJV, ImpD was greater at left-sided

38

sites (9.7Ω versus 7.4Ω, p=0.21) and time to pure R UE significantly shorter: 4.3s versus 6.1s

39

(p=0.02). Minimum case impedance subtracted from pre-RF baseline impedance (BI)

40

generated site-specific ∆BI. Left-sided sites demonstrated significantly greater ∆BI,

41

correlating strongly with Ln(ImpD) – IPPV r=0.84 (0.65 – 0.93), HFJV r=0.77 (0.35 – 0.93).

42

At right-sided sites, ∆BI and Ln(ImpD) were without correlation during IPPV, but correlation

43

was modest during HFJV (r=0.54, -0.007 – 0.84).

44

Conclusions

45

∆BI may usefully indicate catheter-tissue contact surface area (SA). Consequently, greater

46

left-sided LAPW RF effect may result from greater contact SA and in-phase catheter-tissue

47

motion; HFJV may reduce right-sided out-of-phase catheter-tissue motion. Modifying RF

48

delivery based on ∆BI may improve PVI safety and efficacy.

Introduction

63

Pulmonary vein electrical isolation (PVI) is considered a prerequisite for atrial fibrillation

64

(AF) ablation success.1 However, delivering permanently overlapping and transmural (TM)

65

lesions without complications is a complex undertaking; on the one hand, non-TM lesions

66

result in late pulmonary vein (PV) electrical gaps and recurrent AF2, whereas excessive focal

67

radiofrequency (RF) energy delivery risks life-threatening extra-cardiac thermal trauma.3

68

Recently, RF annotation modules have been developed in an effort to provide guidance

69

towards appropriate “per-site” RF delivery during RF PVI. These include novel systems for

70

assessing the adequacy of “per-site” RF lesions, using weighted formulae incorporating

71

catheter-tissue contact-force (CF), RF power and duration.4 Sites of RF application are

72

automatically displayed on a 3-D electroanatomical map using objective descriptors of

73

catheter stability, theoretically facilitating the development of safe, effective and reproducible

74

PVI protocols.5 Subsequent studies have demonstrated how, following the derivation of

75

putative ideal “per-site” targets for RF delivery via retrospective analyses of VISITAG™

76

Module annotation (Biosense Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, CA), >90% freedom from

77

implantable loop recorder (ILR)-detected AF may result from active CF and VISITAG™

78

Module guidance during PVI.6 However, in this “CLOSE-guided” PVI 85 patient cohort,

79

75% experienced intra-oesophageal temperature rise >38.5oC (ITR, SensiTherm™, Abbott),

80

totalling 183 episodes.7 Furthermore, the significantly greater proportion of ITR events

81

occurring at the left-side of the LAPW indicates possible heterogeneity of RF effect at the LA

82

posterior wall (LAPW). Such heterogeneity of RF effect during PVI has been demonstrated

83

previously, with independently conducted investigations providing evidence towards

84

significantly greater RF effect at left-sided left atrial sites.8,9 More recently and via

85

retrospective analyses of VISITAG™ Module annotated sites, ~30% greater RF effect was

86

demonstrated at the left side of the LAPW, evidenced by significantly greater absolute

87

impedance decrease and shorter time to pure R unipolar electrogram (UE) morphology

88

change10 – a histologically validated marker of transmural (TM) RF effect in atrial tissue, in

89

vivo.11,12 Importantly, off-line analyses of exported catheter RF and position data indicated

90

that these findings were neither due to differences in RF duration, nor simply greater catheter

91

instability and/or lower CF at right-sided LAPW sites.10

92

Taken together, these data indicate significantly greater RF effect at the left side of the

93

LAPW of clinical relevance, yet without mechanistic explanation. One possibility is the

94

occurrence of cardiac and/or respiratory cycle-induced site-specific differences in the

95

magnitude of out-of-phase (i.e. sliding) catheter-tissue interaction. While it is neither

96

desirable nor technically possible to perform PVI during complete atrial and ventricular

97

standstill, high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) provides means to eliminate respiratory

98

cycle-induced changes in catheter-tissue interaction. Therefore, the aim of this present report

99

was to retrospectively assess the magnitude of RF effects at first-ablated left and right-sided

100

LAPW sites in consecutive cohorts of patients undergoing PVI during either intermittent

101

positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), or HFJV.

102

103

Methods

104

Single-operator (DRT) CF and VISITAG™ Module-guided PVI was performed employing a

105

previously reported protocol10 in consecutive, unselected adult patients with symptomatic AF

106

undergoing first-time PVI according to current treatment indications.1 All procedures were

107

undertaken using general anaesthesia (GA) with endotracheal intubation. Single transseptal

108

access was obtained with an SL1 (Abbott Cardiovascular, St Paul, MN) sheath, following

109

which either a NaviStar® THERMOCOOL® SMARTTOUCH™ (ST) F curve or NaviStar®

111

Agilis™ NxT sheath (Abbott) was placed in the LA via the first transseptal site.

112

ACCURESP™ respiratory training was undertaken pre-ablation and applied as required to

113

the CARTO® geometry, created using a LASSO® Nav catheter (Biosense Webster). Where

114

respiratory motion was insufficient to trigger the ACCURESP™ detection threshold the tidal

115

volume was never deliberately increased, but where ACCURESP™ respiratory adjustment

116

threshold was exceeded, VISITAG™ Module filter preferences during ablation employed

117

ACCURESP™ set “off” to avoid RF annotation error.13 The IPPV cohort employed fixed 6-

118

8ml/kg ventilation at14-16 breaths per minute, guided by end-tidal CO2; positive end-

119

expiratory pressure 5cmH2O; 50% inspired oxygen concentration. For the HFJV cohort, GA

120

was induced and maintained with a total intravenous anaesthesia technique guided by depth

121

of anaesthesia monitoring (BIS™, Medtronic Inc., St Paul, MN). IPPV was employed until

122

the mapping and ablation phases of the procedure, whereupon HFJV (Monsoon III, Acutronic

123

Medical Systems AG, Hirzel, CH) was used via a jet ventilation catheter; inspired oxygen

124

concentration 60% (titrated to maintain oxygen saturations ≥95%); ventilation frequency 150

125

jets/min; driving pressure 1.0 bar with 1:1 inspiration to expiration ratio.

126

A SkinTact® RO01B30 indifferent electrode (Leonhard Lang GmbH, Innsbruck, AT) was

127

placed on the shaved skin of the thigh posterolaterally, contralateral to any orthopaedic

128

prostheses. VISITAG™ Module and CF-guided PVI was performed during proximal pole CS

129

pacing at 600ms using temperature-controlled RF (48oC, 17ml/min irrigation) via an EP

130

Shuttle® (Stockert GmbH, Freiburg, DE) generator and ThermoCool® SmartTouch® catheter

131

using Agilis™ NxT sheath (Abbott) support. VISITAG™ Module filter preferences for

132

automated RF annotation were: Positional stability range 2mm, tag display duration 3s; force-

133

over-time 100% minimum 1g (the latter to ensure on-going RF annotation only in the

134

presence of constant catheter-tissue contact14). Lesion placement was guided by VISITAG™

136

superior PV ~1cm from the PV ostium; in cases where constant catheter-tissue contact could

137

only be achieved with maximal CF ≥70g, an adjacent LAPW site with lower peak CF was

138

chosen. The target annotated RF duration at each first-ablated LAPW site was 15s, whereas

139

~9-11s was the target for consecutive, adjacent sites during continuous RF delivery. Target

140

inter-tag distance (ITD) ≤6mm was achieved using rapid movement of the catheter tip

141

initiated via the Agilis sheath, aided by the distance measurement tool; point-by-point (PbP)

142

RF was also applied as necessary to achieve this end-point.

143

For the IPPV cohort, 30W RF was used at all sites. However, in view of previous

144

investigations demonstrating ~30% greater RF effect at the left-side of the LAPW10, 20W

145

was the peak power used during first encirclement at left-sided LAPW sites during HFJV. In

146

addition to the RF duration targets described, annotated “per site” LAPW targets during

147

HFJV included a minimum impedance drop of 3Ω. Following completion of circumferential

148

PVI (entrance and exit block), spontaneous recovery of PV conduction was assessed and

149

eliminated during a minimum 20-minute wait; dormant recovery was evaluated and

150

eliminated a minimum of 20 minutes after the last RF. Neither oesophageal luminal

151

temperature monitoring nor post-ablation endoscopic evaluation was employed.

152

This work received IRB approval for publication as a retrospective service evaluation. All

153

patients provided written, informed consent.

154

Analyses

155

Annotated first-site RF duration, mean CF and impedance drop (ImpD) data were obtained

156

via the proprietary VISITAG™ Module export function. Bipolar electrogram (BE) peak-to-

157

peak amplitude and the timing of unipolar electrogram (UE) morphology change from RS to

158

pure R data were retrospectively obtained from CARTOREPLAY™ (Biosense Webster) as

159

previously described.10 Exported text files were converted to Excel data and imported to

GraphPad Prism version 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For correlation analyses,

161

ImpD data was Ln transformed to achieve a normal distribution. Considering the known

162

importance of the surface area (SA) of catheter-tissue contact towards RF lesion creation15, a

163

hypothetical indicator of the ablation catheter-tissue SA at RF onset was retrospectively

164

derived from VISITAG™ Module-based ablation catheter (unipolar) impedance data. This

165

was calculated by subtracting the minimum case impedance value (from the exported

166

“AblationData” file) from the immediate pre-RF onset impedance (i.e. “Base impedance”,

167

BI), to derive the site-specific delta base impedance (∆BI).

168

Statistics

169

Comparisons were made based on the means and standard deviations [SD] of biophysical

170

data (i.e. ILD, RF duration, CF, ImpD), or medians along with the 1st and 3rd quartile (IQR),

171

where these data were determined to be skewed. Differences in the biophysical data between

172

IPPV and HFJV, and left and right-sided LAPW sites were tested using the unpaired t-test, or

173

the Mann-Whitney test where data could not be assumed to be normally distributed. The

174

Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the strength of

175

association between Ln (ImpD) and both BI and ∆BI, as appropriate. In this exploratory

176

analysis, significance was set at the 5% level.

Results

The IPPV cohort comprised 25 patients (November 2016 – May 2017): 13 persistent AF, 12

(80%); mean age 60 [9] years and CHA2DS2-VASc score 1.2 [1.1]. Complete PVI with the

184

following 16.2 [3.1] and 20.0 [4.6] minutes of RF for IPPV and HFJV cohorts, respectively.

185

For the IPPV cohort, pulmonary vein (PV) carina RF was applied in 18/25 patients (72%);

186

i.e. left PV carina in 8/25 (32%) and right PV carina in 16/25 (64%). For the HFJV cohort,

187

PV carina RF was applied in 13/15 patients (87%); i.e. left PV carina in 10/15 (67%), right

188

PV carina only 10/15 (67%). There were no procedural complications.

189

In the IPPV cohort, 3 first-ablated sites were excluded from analysis; inadvertent catheter

190

displacement at two left-sided sites resulted in RF annotation termination at 4.4s and 7.9s,

191

while catheter displacement at RF onset resulted in 5.0s non-annotated RF delivery for one

192

right-sided site. In the HFJV cohort, 4 first-ablated sites were excluded from analysis: For

193

one left-sided site, DC cardioversion (DCCV)-refractory AF was present, while inadvertent

194

catheter displacement resulted in RF annotation termination at 7.1s in another; pure R UE

195

morphology change was not achieved at one left-sided site with pre-ablation bipolar

196

electrogram (BE) amplitude 0.7mV, annotated RF duration 14.7s, mean CF 21g, and ImpD

197

8.6Ω - excepting the one case of DCCV-refractory AF, this was the lowest pre-ablation BE

198

amplitude in the HFJV cohort and was considered an outlier; inadvertent catheter

199

displacement resulted in RF annotation termination at 7.6s for one right-sided site.

Biophysical data: IPPV cohort

201

First-ablated LAPW site biophysical data according to ventilatory protocol and PV pair

202

proximity at the LAPW are shown in table 1. During IPPV and using 30W, annotated RF

203

duration was in keeping with the protocol; i.e. median 14.9s versus 15.0s, left PV (LPV)

204

versus right PV (RPV) aspects of the LAPW respectively. There was no significant difference

205

in pre-ablation BE amplitude; median 1.5mV versus 1.7mV (p=0.95), LPV and RPV

206

respectively. Mean CF was significantly greater at RPV LAPW sites; i.e. 16.5g versus 11.2g

207

(p=0.003), RPV and LPV respectively. During IPPV, both ImpD and time to pure R UE

208

morphology change data indicated significantly greater RF effects at the left side of the

209

LAPW: median ImpD 13.6Ω versus 9.9Ω (p<0.0001), LPV versus RPV respectively; mean

210

time to pure R UE morphology change 4.9s versus 6.7s (p=0.007), LPV versus RPV

211

respectively.

212

During IPPV the mean BI was significantly greater at left-sided LAPW sites; i.e. median

213

182Ω versus 175Ω (p=0.002), LPV versus RPV. The mean minimum (total case) impedance

214

was 141Ω, therefore the mean ∆BI was significantly greater at LPV versus RPV sites; i.e.

215

45.0Ω versus 35.3Ω (p=0.01), LPV versus RPV respectively. For left-sided LAPW sites, both

216

BI and ∆BI demonstrated significant positive correlation with Ln(ImpD), but correlation was

217

strongest for ∆BI: i.e. BI with Ln(ImpD) Pearson r=0.66 (0.34 – 0.84, p=0.0006); ∆BI with

218

Ln(ImpD) r=0.84 (0.65 – 0.93, p<0.0001). For right-sided LAPW sites, neither BI nor ∆BI

219

demonstrated significant correlation with Ln(ImpD); i.e. Spearman r=0.33 (-0.10 – 0.65,

220

p=0.12) and r=0.26 (-0.18 – 0.61, p=0.23) for BI with Ln(ImpD), and ∆BI with Ln(ImpD)

221

respectively (figure 1).

222

Biophysical data: HFJV cohort

223

During HFJV, and using 20W and 30W at left and right-sided LAPW sites respectively,

224

annotated RF duration was in keeping with the protocol; i.e. median 14.5s, both PVs. There

225

was no significant difference in pre-ablation BE amplitude; median 1.5mV versus 1.7mV

226

(p=0.94), LPV and RPV respectively. There was no difference in mean CF during HFJV; i.e.

227

12.5g and 12.0g (p=0.61), LPV versus RPV respectively. During HFJV, median ImpD was

228

greater at LPV sites (9.7Ω versus 7.4Ω, p=0.21) but this did not reach statistical significance.

229

However, time to pure R UE morphology change was significantly shorter at LPV sites; i.e.

230

mean 4.3s versus 6.1s (p=0.02), LPV versus RPV respectively.

231

During HFJV the mean BI was significantly greater at left-sided LAPW sites; i.e. 183Ω

232

versus 174Ω (p=0.03), LPV versus RPV respectively. The mean minimum (total case)

233

impedance was 143Ω and 136Ω, LPV and RPV respectively (p=0.25). Therefore, the mean

234

∆BI was significantly greater at LPV versus RPV sites; i.e. 45.7Ω versus 32.4Ω (p=0.004),

235

LPV versus RPV respectively. At left-sided LAPW sites during HFJV both BI and ∆BI

236

demonstrated significant positive correlation with Ln(ImpD), but correlation was strongest

237

for ∆BI; BI with Ln(ImpD), Pearson r=0.59 (0.03 – 0.87, p=0.04), whereas ∆BI with Ln

238

(ImpD), r=0.77 (0.35 – 0.93, p=0.004). At right-sided LAPW sites during HFJV there was no

239

significant correlation between BI and Ln(ImpD); Spearman r=0.33 (-0.26 – 0.74, p=0.25).

240

However, right-sided LAPW sites during HFJV demonstrated moderate positive correlation

241

for ∆BI with Ln(ImpD); Spearman r=0.54 (-0.007 – 0.84, p=0.047, figure 2).

242

There was no significant correlation between mean CF and Ln(ImpD) within any ventilatory

243

group; i.e. r=-0.24, 0.07, 0.02 and -0.10 for LPV IPPV, RPV IPPV, LPV HFJV and RPV

244

HFJV, respectively.

245

246

Discussion

247

The main finding of this present report is that heterogeneity of RF effect at the LAPW was

248

not eliminated using a HFJV protocol; i.e. greater effect remained evident at left-sided sites,

249

despite reducing left-sided LAPW power delivery by 30%. Therefore, although heterogeneity

250

of RF effect cannot be completely explained on the basis of respiratory motion-induced

251

differences catheter-tissue interaction, these present data can be used to derive hypotheses

252

towards other possible mechanisms underlying heterogeneity of RF effects during PVI.

254

Hypothetical mechanisms underlying heterogeneity of RF effects in vivo

255

In this present experimental set-up, identical and objectively annotated parameters for

256

position and CF stability – the two presently measureable components of catheter “stability”

257

– were prospectively employed in order to meet a suitable definition of a “stable” point: (1)

258

Position stability range 2mm with ACCURESP “off” – VISITAG™ Module logic previously

259

shown to satisfy “stable point” criteria13, and; (2) force-over-time 100%, minimum 1g CF –

260

self-evidently, constant catheter-tissue contact is a prerequisite at “stable” sites.14 Previous

261

investigations have demonstrated that greater RF effect at left-sided LAPW sites was not

262

simply due to measurably superior position stability.10 Therefore, assuming equal RF

263

generator power delivery, greater RF effect in this in vivo model must result from either

264

greater catheter-tissue interaction stability as a result of significantly lower out-of-phase (i.e.

265

sliding) catheter-tissue interaction, and/or a greater SA of catheter-tissue contact.

266

From a theoretical standpoint, if an ablation catheter is kept “positionally stable” and

267

(knowingly) remains stable throughout “per-site” RF delivery without significant out-of-

268

phase catheter-tissue interaction, differences in the SA of catheter-tissue contact will be the

269

principal determinant of measureable differences of RF effects, since:

270

“Tissue power” (P) = I2.R

271

(I is current density and R, tissue resistance).15

272

In this theoretical model of stable catheter-tissue interaction, any suitable measure of the SA

273

of catheter-tissue contact will demonstrate strong positive correlation with RF effects.

274

Therefore, this present report’s finding of a strong positive correlation between ∆BI and

275

Ln(ImpD) at left-sided LAPW sites indicates not only that ∆BI may represent a suitable

276

indicator of the SA of catheter-tissue contact in vivo, but also that catheter-tissue interaction

277

at left-sided LAPW sites is predominantly in-phase. At the right-sided LAPW sites, the

278

significantly lower ∆BI supports the proposition that ∆BI provides a suitable measure of

279

catheter-tissue contact SA. However, during IPPV and despite ablation catheter motion

280

remaining within identical pre-defined limits, the lack of significant correlation between ∆BI

281

and Ln(ImpD) indicates significant and presently un-measureable, out-of-phase catheter-

282

tissue interaction. In contrast, the finding of a modest positive correlation between ∆BI and

283

Ln(ImpD) at right-sided LAPW sites during HFJV indicates that the operative environment

284

during HFJV is characterised by a reduction in out-of-phase catheter-tissue interaction, but

285

not to the same level of in-phase stability as that inferred using these methods at left-sided

286

LAPW sites.

287

Possible mechanisms for significant differences in the SA of catheter-tissue contact

288

comparing left and right-sided sites could include either/or both of: (1) Differences in the

289

angle of the catheter tip with respect to the target tissue, such that at some sites the contact

290

surface may include both the (tip) face and lateral aspects of the catheter tip, whereas at

291

others, contact is limited to the surface of the (tip) face only; (2) Differences in tissue

292

compliance, with greater SA resulting from more compliant tissue enveloping the catheter tip,

293

potentially even at lower CF. These present data do not permit further conclusions to be

294

drawn regarding the relative importance of these possible mechanisms in vivo, however,

295

greater impedance drop has been demonstrated during PVI with parallel or oblique catheter-

296

tissue angle (30o – 145o) compared to perpendicular (0 – 30o).8

297

Pre-ablation impedance as a possible determinant of RF effect in vivo

298

Previous investigations during slow pathway and accessory pathway RF ablation

299

demonstrated strong positive correlation between the initial generator impedance (GI) and

300

electrode temperature during RF delivery.16 In a pig thigh model of RF ablation using a linear

301

multi-electrode catheter, greater baseline (unipolar) impedance was demonstrated with

13

302

greater applied downward force, and there was a strong positive correlation between baseline

303

impedance and lesion depth and width.17 More recently and using an ablation catheter with

304

mini-electrodes incorporated in the distal electrode (Rhythmia™ and IntellaNav MiFi™ OI,

305

Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA), the predictive utility of baseline generator and local

306

impedances (LI – taken as the maximal value from all three mini electrodes) were

307

investigated during PVI. The baseline GI demonstrated weak positive correlation with

308

subsequent RF-induced GI drop (adjusted R2=0.06, p<0.001). However, higher baseline LI

309

predicted higher LI drop during ablation (adjusted R2=0.41, p<0.001).18 Lastly, finite element

310

modelling of a 7F 4mm ablation catheter and homogeneous tissue slab (4mm thickness) with

311

simulations of varying depth and angle of catheter-tissue interaction, demonstrated a very

312

strong positive correlation between increasing contact area and impedance (R=0.97).

313

Moreover, while the impedance increased at greater depth of catheter-tissue penetration, the

314

catheter angle was a significant determinant of impedance; incrementally greater impedance

315

was noted as the angle was decreased from 90o to 15o in 15o steps. Importantly, catheter angle

316

was a more important determinant of impedance at greater modelled depth of tissue

317

penetration.19

318

Clinical implications

319

The inference of both significantly greater in-phase catheter-tissue interaction and greater SA

320

of stable contact at left-sided LAPW sites provides the perfect milieu for inadvertent extra-

321

cardiac thermal trauma from a “one-size-fits-all”, single RF power and duration delivery

322

protocol during PVI. Similarly, ablation protocols employing identical LAPW RF targets

323

using theoretical composite measures of RF delivery (i.e. Ablation Index – AI, or VISITAG

324

SURPOINT™, Biosense Webster – and lesion size index – LSI, Abbott) will also result in

325

heterogeneous tissue injury during PVI, perpetuating this risk.4,6 This is particularly

326

concerning in view of the more frequently occurring left-sided oesophageal position20 and

327

high case fatality rates of ablation-induced atrio-oesophageal fistula.21 Therefore for greater

328

safety, operators may wish to consider adopting protocols involving lower RF power, shorter

329

RF duration and/or lower AI/LSI targets at the left side of the LAPW, or simply utilising

330

more direct and in vivo validated measures of tissue RF effect including impedance drop

331

and/or pure R UE morphology change.10,22–24

332

Since ∆BI may represent a useful site-specific pre-ablation predictor of RF effect, operators

333

may wish to mimic this described operative “stability set-up”. Specifically, with ∆BI

334

representing a putative predictor of RF effect within this reproducible “operative stability

335

environment”, the risk of extra-cardiac thermal trauma during RF delivery using higher

336

power (50-90W) over very short ablation intervals (e.g. 3-5s)25,26 – i.e. within potentially very

337

narrow therapeutic windows and involving significant latency27 – may be reduced by

338

modified protocols incorporating ∆BI data. In contrast, protocols using deep conscious

339

sedation with consequent greater random variability of respiratory profile and occasional

340

inadvertent patient movement are unlikely to demonstrate similar predictive utility of ∆BI

341

towards subsequent “per-site” RF effects.

342

Limitations

343

Time to pure R UE morphology change is an imperfect indicator of RF effect in the absence

344

of left atrial wall thickness data; i.e. shorter time to pure R alone does not necessarily indicate

345

greater RF effect. The methodology for defining the site-specific ablation catheter-to-tissue

346

contact SA described in this present report (i.e. ∆BI) is theoretical. Indeed, more appropriate

347

methodology towards deriving putative “predictive” ∆BI values would be to subtract the pre-

348

ablation “blood-pool” impedance from site-specific BI. However, at the outset of these

349

present investigations “blood-pool” impedance data were not known to be of potential use,

350

and there were no means to obtain these data retrospectively. Clearly, the hypothesis that pre-

351

ablation ∆BI represents a site-specific predictor of RF effect during PVI requires further

352

investigations using “blood-pool” impedance values.

353

These data are limited by their single operator status, applicability to the operative stability

354

conditions described and choice of RF annotation logic using the VISITAG™ Module.

355

However, such stringent catheter stability criteria alongside measureable (and visible to any

356

operator) VISITAG™ Module data outputs may permit these present investigations to form

357

the basis of knowingly reproducible RF delivery in vivo, both on an intra and inter-operator

358

basis. These data should not be considered applicable to TactiCath™-based ablation (Abbott),

359

since according to the dimensions of the ablation catheter tip electrode, angle-dependent

360

changes in the SA of contact will result in catheter-specific differences in tissue RF current

361

density and ablation effect.28

362

RF power output from the EP Shuttle® RF generator has been shown to vary according to the

363

pre-ablation impedance; i.e. comparing 30W at 150Ω versus 200Ω, power output at 200Ω

364

was 14% greater, measuring 34.1W.29 However, differences between left and right-sided

365

LAPW BI values in this present report (IQR 177 – 196 and 170 – 180 for LPV and RPV,

366

respectively) were probably insufficient to importantly influence generator RF power output

367

and furthermore, greater RF effect remained at left-sided sites during HFJV despite 30%

368

lower power delivery at left-sided sites.

369

370

Conclusions

371

These data support the hypothesis that greater RF ablation effect at left-sided LAPW sites

372

results from significantly greater SA of catheter-to-tissue contact and in-phase catheter-tissue

373

motion. However, HFJV may usefully reduce out-of-phase catheter-tissue motion at right-

sided LAPW sites. Using suitably stable and reproducible conditions of catheter-tissue

375

contact, ∆BI may represent a useful site-specific predictor of RF ablation effect, towards

376

improving the safety and efficacy of PVI.
