Abstract

Purpose: Genomic medicine has transformed the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental
disorders. Evidence of increased psychiatric comorbidity associated with genomic copy
number and single nucleotide variants (CNV and SNV) may not be fully considered when
providing genetic counselling. We explored parents’ experiences of genetics services and
how they obtained information concerning psychiatric manifestations.

Methods: Parents of children diagnosed with genomic variants completed an online survey
exploring, (i) how they experienced the genetic diagnosis, and (ii) how they acquired
information about psychiatric, developmental and physical manifestations.

Results: Two-hundred and 86 respondents completed the survey. Thirty percent were
unsatisfied with receiving genetic diagnoses. Satisfaction was predicted if communication
was by geneticists (p = 0.004); provided face-to-face (p = 0.003); clearly explained (p <
0.001); and accompanied by support (p = 0.017). Parents obtained psychiatric information
from non-professional sources more often than developmental ( 0.26, p < 0.001) and
physical manifestations ( 0.21, p = 0.003), which mostly came from health professionals.
Information from support organisations was more helpful than from geneticists (odds ratio
[OR] 21.0, 95% CI 5.1 – 86.8, p < 0.001); paediatricians (OR 11.0, 1.4 – 85.2, p = 0.004);
and internet sites (OR 15.5, 3.7 – 64.8, p < 0.001).

Conclusion: A paucity of professional information about psychiatric risks after genetic
diagnosis may impede early diagnosis and intervention for children with high genotypic risks.
Planned integration of genomic testing into mainstream services should include genetic
counselling training to address the full spectrum of developmental, physical and psychiatric
manifestations and timely provision of high-quality information.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 1 in 25 children in high income countries have neurodevelopmental disabilities
(ND).[1] Clinical evaluation may include genetic investigations, which for many individuals
can improve diagnostic accuracy, guide appropriate interventions and enhance genetic
counselling for the family. Technological barriers to identifying genetic causes in severely
disabled children have substantially diminished since the mid 2000s with the introduction of
genome-wide diagnostic tests, primarily chromosomal microarray (CMA) assays capable of
detecting sub-microscopic genomic imbalances known as Copy Number Variants (CNVs).
Numerous genomic variants including CNVs and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have
been associated with ND and co-occurring psychiatric phenotypes.[2–4] For example, the
3Mb CNV diagnosed in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (formerly Velocardiofacial Syndrome
and DiGeorge syndrome) is causally associated with high rates of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), ADHD, schizophrenia, oppositional defiant disorders and anxiety.[5–7) Collectively, ND
associated CNVs are implicated in up to 15% of children with severe developmental
disorders who access genomic medicine services.[[8] Estimates suggest up to 42% of
undiagnosed developmental disorders (DD) are due to de novo mutations in coding
sequences about which risks for psychiatric complications are less well understood.[[9]

Variation in the penetrance of genomic variants associated with ND,[10–12] suggests health
outcomes are susceptible to socio-environmental modification, additional undetected
mutations and polygenic variation, presenting significant barriers to personalisation of
medicine, genetic counselling and family-oriented information. However, genomic diagnosis
is recognised as a major advantage to individuals with rare developmental disorders.[13,14]
Progress towards introducing increasingly sophisticated whole genome and exome
sequencing into clinical services is, however, placing additional demands on practitioners in
terms of additional training requirements, clinic time, informed consent, and information
provision.[15–17] The complexity of neurodevelopmental, physical and psychiatric outcomes
associated with deleterious genomic variants presents important challenges for practitioners

confronted by parents requiring detailed information about their child’s future health and
wellbeing.[18–20]

The design and implementation of genomics medicine services for a broader range of
neurodevelopmental conditions should account for the views and opinions of service users
and recognise the need for relevant information both before and after genetic investigations.
In this study we sought to address these issues by, (i) identifying key factors influencing
parental satisfaction with genetics services, specifically the communication of diagnostic
variants by clinical specialists; (ii) exploring how parents gain knowledge of developmental,
psychiatric and physical manifestations of genomic variants; and (iii) comparing the
availability, content and helpfulness of patient information obtained from health professionals,
internet sites, voluntary support groups and other sources.

METHODS

Survey respondents and procedures

We designed a 46 item online survey, using Online Surveys
(https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk, Jisc, Bristol UK), for parents of children aged 0-17 years
with developmental, intellectual and congenital disorders having a clinical genetic diagnosis.
The survey comprised 4 main sections: (1) family demographics, child’s genotype, reported
medical, developmental and psychiatric diagnoses, family genetic history; (2) awareness of
manifestations associated with child’s genetic diagnoses and sources of information to
understand them; (3) ratings of the quantity, content and helpfulness of information from; and
(4) experiences of services and receiving genetic test results. An introductory section
included information about the research team, the purpose of the study, instructions for
participating, participant confidentiality and data protection. Participants provided consent by
agreeing with the statement, “I have read the information above and on the previous page,

understand that my participation is voluntary, and I am happy to complete the questionnaire”.
The study received ethical approval from Cardiff University School of Medicine Ethics
Committee on 19 September 2014 (reference SMREC 14/34). Invitations to take part were
distributed by advertisements in newsletters, websites and Facebook pages and by word-ofmouth at family support days sponsored by rare disorders support groups, including Unique
– Understanding Rare Chromosome and Gene Disorders, Max Appeal, and Microdeletion
16p11.2 Support and Information UK.

Statistical analyses

Response data was coded and downloaded from the survey website into the SPSS package
(IBM Corp. SPSS Statistics for Mac, version 25.0, Armonk, NY, 2017) for statistical analysis.
For identification of factors which influence parental satisfaction with genetics services we did
logistic regression. We designed a hierarchical model including variables covering, (i)
demographic data; (ii) components of genetic counselling process; and (iii) health providers
involved in communicating results. The binary outcome variable was defined as parental
satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the communication of diagnostic genetic test results by
their health provider. The initial regression model incorporated family and child specific
covariate using method ‘Enter’. Sequential hierarchical models incorporated genetic
counselling and communication modality specific covariates. Where appropriate, ordinal
variables were collapsed into fewer categories where responses were low. Odds ratios
correspond to the exponentiated unstandardised coefficients (beta weights) for each
variable. We employed a variety of tests to explore (a) sources of and (b) relative merits of
information received by families after genetic testing. To compare information sources
reported we used chi-square analyses of 2x2 contingency tables to examine relationships
between 4 categories of manifestation, (i) developmental, (ii) physical, (iii) neuropsychiatric
and (iv) other psychiatric disorders. Effect sizes were described in terms of Cramer’s phi
coefficients (). Pairwise comparisons of information sources between individual
manifestations was done by McNemar’s chi-square tests for marginal homogeneity in

matched-pair binomial data. Odds ratios were calculated with VassarStats at
http://www.vassarstats.net. To explore the relative quantity and quality of data from different
sources we employed Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test to compare Likert scale responses and
derived effect sizes (r) from Z scores.

RESULTS

Respondents

Two-hundred and eighty-six survey responses were recorded between 12 December 2014
and 31 May 2017. 199 respondents (70%) were located in the UK and 87 (30%) in the USA.
Table 1 shows details of the respondents and their children. The most frequent reasons for
referral to genetics services were developmental delay (N= 98, 34.4%), congenital anomaly
(12.2%) and dysmorphic features (N=21, 7.3%). In addition to the referral indication for
genetic testing, parents reported their children had multiple developmental, physical,
neuropsychiatric and other mental health manifestations, a mean of 5.7 diagnoses. In terms
of genetic diagnoses, 243 (85%) were diagnosed with chromosomal copy number variants
(CNVs) which reportedly explained the referral. Of the CNVs reported, 116 (40.6%) were loci
significantly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric outcomes. Sixteen (5.6%)
children had more than 1 CNV and 22 (7.7%) were diagnosed with single nucleotide variants
(SNV) of which 5 were eponymous genetic syndromes. Thirty-nine parents (13.6%) reported
their child’s CNV was inherited.

Reporting genetic diagnoses for developmental disorders
The great majority of respondents received their child’s genetic test result from paediatricians
(130/286, 45.5%), clinical geneticists (116/286, 40.6%) or genetic counsellors (28/286,
9.8%). Parents were more likely to receive results from paediatricians than genetic
specialists in the UK (107 vs 81) compared to those in the USA (22 vs 63, p <0.001). Eighty-

five of 286 respondents (29.7%) were dissatisfied with how their child’s test result was
communicated. Parents in the UK were more likely to be dissatisfied than in the USA (66/199
vs 19/87; p = 0.05). In terms of the specialism of health professionals delivering results,
parents significantly were more likely to be satisfied when genetic specialists delivered
results (116/144, 80.6%) as compared to paediatricians (78/129, 60.5%; p <0.001), which
was accounted for by UK responses (figure 1 upper panel). More than one-in-three (101/286,
35.3%) were not satisfied with the explanation of their child’s genetic findings. Dissatisfaction
was more prevalent among UK than USA respondents (78/199 vs 23/87, p = 0.038). Again
parents were more likely to be satisfied by explanations given by genetic specialists than by
paediatricians (106/144 vs 70/129, p = 0.001), which was also accounted for by UK
responses (figure 1 lower panel). Around 3-in-10 parents (90/286, 31.5%) did not receive
supporting information to accompany test results, which was more prevalent among UK
respondents (36.2% vs 20.7%, p = 0.009). Almost three quarters of parents (208/286,
72.7%) reported not receiving support when test results were given, half (142/286, 49.7%)
were not offered follow-up appointments.

We used logistic regression to identify predictive factors for satisfaction with receiving genetic
test results, incorporating 3 categories of variables; (i) child and family specific; (ii) genetic
counselling; and (iii) modes of communication. A hierarchical model revealed satisfaction
was most likely if, (i) results were presented by genetic specialists rather than paediatricians
(OR = 2.97, CI 1.41–6.26); (ii) results were communicated in person instead of letter or
telephone call (OR = 2.91, CI 1.41–6.26); (iii) results were satisfactorily explained (OR =
5.14, 95% CI 2.58–10.26); and (iv) support was given at the same time (OR = 2.99 CI 1.21–
7.36). Interestingly, parents of children identified as male were substantially more likely to be
satisfied than those with females (final model OR = 2.56, CI 1.28–5.14). Receiving
supplementary information from the practitioner or a follow-up appointment did not predict
satisfaction. The final model accounted for 40.5% of the variance in the outcome variable
(see Table in supplementary information).

Sources of information on genomic disorders

We asked parents to indicate which sources they had used to gather information concerning
manifestations associated with their child’s genetic variant, (i) health professionals; (ii)
internet sites; (iii) voluntary sector support groups; and (iv) other lay sources (friends and
family, books, leaflets and other materials). We compared sources used between 4 groups of
manifestations, (i) developmental disorders; (ii) physical anomalies; (iii) neuropsychiatric
disorders; and (iv) mood and psychotic disorders (defined in table 2). Information on
developmental disorders was more likely to be given by health professionals at the time of
genetic diagnosis or at follow-up compared with neuropsychiatric disorders (60.7% vs
37.9%), for which a majority parents used alternative sources (Cramer’s  0.22, p < 0.001).
The disparity increased when comparing developmental disorders with mood and psychotic
manifestations (60.7% vs 28.6% used health professional sources, ( 0.29, p < 0.001) but
not physical anomalies (table 2). Overall, fewer parents were informed about mental health
manifestations 34.7% than developmental and physical manifestations (59%) by their
clinician after genetic diagnosis as opposed to finding information from other sources, (
0.24, p <0.001). Following genetic diagnosis, fewer than 1-in-3 parents received information
from their child’s Clinician about the possibility of mood and psychotic disorders (table 2).

The observation of increased psychiatric co-morbidity in individuals with neurodevelopmental
CNVs (ND-CNVs) [5] prompted us to examine whether clinicians were more likely to offer
information concerning risks for either neurodevelopmental or psychiatric outcomes to
parents of children diagnosed with ND-CNVs (116/248, 46.8% reported CNVs) with,
compared to those with other CNVs (132/248, 53.2%). For neurodevelopmental phenotypes
(DCD, OCD, ADHD and ASD, defined in table 2), combined responses across all
manifestations revealed parents of children with ND-CNVs were more likely to obtain
information from lay sources than from their child’s clinician (Cramer’s  0.13, p = 0.004).
The difference between CNV type was greatest for DCD ( 0.29, p = 0.004). Similarly, for
psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia or psychosis, anxiety and depression), in the event of
receiving ND-CNV diagnoses, parents were more likely to employ lay sources of information
( 0.16, p = 0.01). There were no differences between information sources for developmental
or physical manifestations.

We then compared the main source of information (clinician delivering result versus all other
sources) between individual manifestations parents associated with their child’s genetic
diagnosis. Marginal homogeneity tests of matched pair data compared sources for each
manifestation with reference phenotypes for 3 categories or clinical manifestation: ID
(developmental disorders); cardiac anomalies (physical disorders); and ASD (psychiatric
disorders). Compared to ID, information about all psychiatric manifestation was more likely to
be obtained from sources other than clinicians. Odds ratios (OR) ranged from 2.7 for ASD
(95% CI 1.5 – 4.8, p = 0.001) to 18.0 for depression (CI 2.4 – 134.8, p < 0.001) (figure 3,
upper panel). Other than DD, there were no differences between the main source for ID and
any developmental or physical disorder we tested (figure 2 upper panel). Comparisons with
information sources for cardiac anomalies revealed a similar picture, with ORs ranging from
3.63 for ASD (CI 1.7 – 7.9, p = 0.001) to 31.0 for depression (CI 4.23 – 227.1, p < 0.001)

(figure 2 middle panel). Finally, in comparison to ASD, information about anxiety, depression
and OCD was more likely to be acquired from lay sources, OR range 6.0 for OCD (CI 1.8 –
20.4, p = 0.001) to 16.0 for anxiety (CI 2.1 – 120.7, p < 0.001) (figure 2 lower panel).
Conversely, parents were more likely to be informed about cardiac anomalies,
developmental delay, intellectual disability and speech and language delay by clinicians
rather than obtaining information from other sources. Odds ratios varied between 2.7 for ID
(CI 1.5 – 4.8, p = 0.001) and 12.8 for DD (CI 5.6 – 29.5, p < 0.001).

We explored whether large differences in the speciality of clinicians returning genetic test
results in UK and USA associated with different patterns of information seeking by parents
subsequent to diagnosis. Parents in the USA received more information on developmental
and physical manifestations from health professionals (68.5% professional vs 31.5% other

figure 3a). Between country differences were larger for psychiatric disorders. For
neuropsychiatric manifestations (ASD, ADHD, OCD), 69.5% of UK parents obtained
information from lay sources compared to 45.3% in the USA ( 0.23, p < 0.001). For mood
and psychotic disorders (anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, psychosis) less than 1-in-5
(19.2%) UK parents obtained information from clinicians, compared to 47.6% in the USA (
0.30, p <0.001, figure 3c). Overall, UK parents sought information alternative sources more
often than their US counterparts (57.6% vs 38.3%, Cramer’s  0.18, p < 0.001, figure 3d).

Finally, we evaluated respondents’ opinions on the quantity, content and helpfulness of
information obtained according to its source. Analysis of mean ranks revealed the amount of
information available from support groups was more optimal than from paediatricians (r 0.47,
p <0.001), geneticists (r 0.51, p <0.001) and internet sites (r 0.38, p <0.001) (table 3).
Similarly, information from internet sites was more optimal than that from paediatricians (r
0.34, p <0.001) and geneticists (r 0.32, p <0.001). In terms of the quality of its content,
information from support groups was more optimal than internet sites (r 0.31, p <0.001),

DISCUSSION

This is the first quantitative survey of its kind to investigate how parents experience the
communication of genomic tests for developmental disorders and their endeavours to gain
knowledge about health implications associated with their child’s diagnosis. At a time of rapid
advances in diagnosing rare disorders and diversification of genetics services, this is an
important topic. Our survey reveals parents have mixed experiences of attending genetics
services. A third of those in the UK reported dissatisfaction with the communication of test
results. Information provided by health specialists was less helpful and of inferior quality
compared to information respondents obtained from other sources, particularly voluntary
support groups. Information provided by health specialists was predominantly focused on
developmental and physical challenges typically present at diagnosis and parents relied
heavily on their own resources to find information about psychiatric manifestations
associated with their child’s genetic variant. Families in the UK were more reliant than the
USA on internet sites and voluntary sector organisations for information, particularly for
neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

The findings extend previous evidence showing that families often have difficulties obtaining
satisfactory information from clinical specialists to aid comprehension of genomic tests
results.[21–23] We have revealed new evidence concerning a broad range of genomic
disorders consistent with earlier findings concerning 22q11.2 deletion syndrome - one of the
most frequently diagnosed genomic disorders - in which parents predominantly obtained
psychiatric information from internet sites and support groups.[24,25] Consistent with studies
of rare disorders more generally, we found that most respondents resorted to internet
searches to help comprehend their child’s diagnosis.[26] However, many families do not
seek medical information online, and this may particularly be the case for more
socioeconomically deprived groups.[27] Limited access to information is associated with
increased stress and uncertainty for parents and negatively influences engagement with
healthcare services, potentially negating some the advantages of having precision

diagnoses.[28] Our survey did not gather sufficient demographic data to determine whether
hard-pressed families were less likely to seek online content. However, we are concerned
that socially disadvantaged families may not have the same degree of access to high quality
information, support and services to which they are entitled.[29] This is emphasised by our
finding that, as in previous studies, parents often consider information from clinical specialists
to be overcomplicated, irrelevant or unhelpful compared to online content or from support
groups.[30]

Our study showed that paediatric and genetic specialists tend to focus on providing
information about developmental and physical disabilities at the time of giving genetic test
results, suggesting either that information about psychiatric risks may be less readily
available, or that informing parents about risks of behavioural, emotional and psychotic
disorders is less relevant when communicating test results.[31–33] In the context of
communicating pathogenic neurodevelopmental CNVs with significant evidence of
psychiatric, our findings indicated parents were no more likely to be informed about these
than were others. Moreover, our findings suggest parents of children with ND-CNVs tend to
find psychiatric information through alternative sources including internet searches,
suggesting extensive evidence on neuropsychiatric genotype-phenotype associations in NDCNVs is yet to be incorporated into genetic counselling for individuals with developmental
disorders. Often cited concerns over overloading parents with information in the aftermath of
a genetic diagnosis should be balanced against the best interests of children and parents’
desires for comprehensive health information.[34–36] We recommend the translation of
evidence on adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes into care guidelines for ND-CNVs coupled
with mechanisms ensuring timely provision of family-oriented information which accounts for
the needs and wishes of families over time.[37–39]

Our findings revealed differences in the communication of test results and information
gathering between UK and US families. More than half of UK parents received their child’s
diagnosis from paediatricians, compared to one-in-five in the USA. Parents in the USA

received a broader range of medical and mental health information from their clinician,
whereas UK parents obtain most neurodevelopmental and psychiatric information from
alternative sources. However, the lower frequency of provision of psychiatric information by
clinicians the UK was not explained by the smaller proportion of parents receiving their result
from genetic specialists. As such, our survey failed to uncover evidence explaining why
provision of psychiatric information from clinical professionals is relatively infrequent the UK,
or, conversely why parents in US receive a broader range of information from their doctor.
Other factors may account for these differences, such as healthcare service models,
availability and duration of face-to-face appointments, or differences in professional
development and training.

Opinions vary on the benefits and risks of online health information, ranging from concerns
among health professionals over accuracy, relevance and under-regulation, to endorsements
from sociologists in support of its contribution to client empowerment. Although an
understudied topic, evidence has been published that the general public adopt contingent
behaviours towards online content, discriminating between trustworthy and untrustworthy
content in order to supplement rather than replace traditional media.[40] Importantly,
universal online search methods are increasingly concordant with the structure of internet
health information and the hierarchical nature of results created by popular search engines.
Therefore, we recommend initiatives which support clinicians to improve access to
comprehensive, high quality information around the time of diagnosis, including signposting
to digital content beyond traditional media and support voluntary support groups to innovate
new ways of supporting children with complex disabilities.

The findings presented here are timely; paediatric genetics services need to strike a fine
balance between delivering high quality services for escalating referrals and performing
increasingly sophisticated tests with lengthy consent procedures. That a significant
proportion of respondents in our survey expressed dissatisfaction receiving genetic
diagnoses highlights the challenge facing specialised clinical services. As the availability of

genomic testing in mainstream services increases, the demand for relevant patient-oriented
information concerning genetic influences on psychiatric risks are predicted to
increase.[41,42] However, informing patients and families about complex and uncertain
implications of genetic tests is challenging, requiring specialised expertise covering multiple
domains of physical, medical and mental health, sensitive risk counselling and facilitation of
parents’ adaptation to the diagnosis. Personalising psychiatric risk across the lifespan such
that families and patients understand the true nature of their risks is likely to become a
priority for psychiatrists and other specialists working in neuropsychiatric disorders. Without a
sound understanding of these risks, parents will be less well equipped to recognize and
respond to symptoms and access early interventions which – especially in the context of
psychotic disorders – can lead to better long term outcomes.[43,44] We recommend that
education and training in brain disorders is prioritised for all clinical specialties considering
genetic testing.[45,46] Curriculum content should be developed accordingly, ensuring genetic
counselling includes meaningful conversations about the full spectrum of medical and mental
health risks accompanied by contemporary, relevant information. Fortuitously, evidence
revealing complex but broadly similar psychiatric outcomes for children with recurrent
neurodevelopmental CNVs suggests integrating a coordinated general approach to
psychiatric care planning into a dedicated multidisciplinary clinical pathway for such children
could be justified, with individual tailoring for genotype-specific risks.[47] This would require
fundamental changes to service configuration and delivery and greater awareness of this
significant population among health providers and other professionals.

Our study has limitations. Recruitment was biased in favour of parents who engage with the
support groups who promoted the survey, potentially limiting the generalisability of our
findings. The survey was designed with broad accessibility in mind. However, online surveys
require significant internet literacy and time for participation, which may be difficult for some
families. Parents who readily access the internet, are, conceivably, more likely to use it for
seeking information related to the content of this study. The survey was overwhelmingly

completed by mothers. However, families with severely disabled children are rare and not
representative of the general population and this may be a reflection of the socio-domestic
influences on caregiving in the context of disability.[48] Also, we were unable to
independently verify health information provided by parents. Self-report surveys have
recognised shortcomings exacerbated by respondents potentially having to recall facts and
experiences several years after the event. Despite these limitations, the views and
experiences expressed by a large number of families provides a timely insight into the
current state of medical health information, clinical services and lay support for neurodisability communities.

In summary, our findings reveal that parents often feel inadequately informed by their clinical
specialists about potential neurodevelopmental and psychiatric challenges in the context of
paediatric genetic testing. Parents search extensively for information about their child’s
genetic diagnosis, retrieving neuropsychiatric information primarily from internet sites and lay
support groups, where accuracy and validity is unregulated and likely less reliable. We
believe the current results are important in informing service development and training in
both clinical genetics and psychiatry. In particular, they point to the need for closer
integration of medical genetics and psychiatry to address the needs of those receiving a
genetic diagnosis. Future initiatives should focus on identifying measures to promote the
inclusion of psychiatric risk information, provide greater support in genetic counselling clinics
and ensuring that education and training for practitioners encompass the full spectrum of
neurodevelopmental and mental health challenges faced by children with genomic disorders.
