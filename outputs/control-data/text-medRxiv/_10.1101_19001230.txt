Abstract (150 words)
We investigated how ASD genetic risk relates to neurodevelopmental features (491 traits
tested) via polygenic risk scoring (PRS) in 4,309 young non-ASD probands from the
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. ASD PRS most strongly associated with the ability to
correctly identify angry facial emotions in youths aged 11-17 years (R2=1.06%, p=1.38x10-7) and
replicated similarly in older probands (>18 years) (R2=0.55%, p=0.036). The association in 11to-17-year-old probands was independent of other psychiatric disorders, brain imaging
phenotypes, and educational attainment. ASD PRS also associated with proband-reported
emotionality and connectedness with others. The proband-reported irritability trait was highly
correlated with angry facial emotion recognition (r2=0.159, p=2.74x10-5) but was independently
associated with ASD PRS (R2=1.20%, p=1.18x10-4). Several informant-reported (i.e., typically
mother-reported) traits were predicted by the proband’s ASD PRS, including duration of fear
(R2=0.156%, p=0.001). These data indicate how genetic liability to ASD may influence
neurodevelopment in the general population, especially the development of emotional
intelligence.

Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) describes a group of pervasive neurodevelopmental
disorders characterized by impaired social and communication skills. ASD typically manifests as
a heterogeneous combination of repetitive and restrictive behavioral symptoms along with
intellectual capabilities ranging from above average intelligence quotient (IQ) to intellectual
disability.1 ASD affects approximately 1-1.5% of the general population and is diagnosed more
frequently in males than females.2
ASD often causes serious impairment for affected individuals, although there is a large
range and some function quite normally. Still, we need to resolve a puzzle on the population
level – the polygenic risk that leads to ASD is composed of the effects of many risk loci, which
are individually very small. What are the other effects of these risk loci? Is there any benefit to
risk-allele carries who do not have enough collative risk to express ASD? Why are they
maintained in the population? One possible explanation is that ASD PRS correlates with
selection for better cognitive function.3 While that is a tantalizing clue, we might suspect that
effects of ASD risk alleles in non-affected individuals might relate not just to cognitive function,
but to traits more closely related to those that are seen in the pathological range in ASD subjects,
such as those related to social-emotional reciprocity and nonverbal communication, difficulty
developing and understanding relationships, repetitive motions, and hyper- or hypo-reactivity to
sensory input. Investigating these relationships is the main premise of this investigation.
Using common genetic variation, Grove, et al.4 reported an estimated SNP-based
observed-scale ASD heritability of ~12% in Europeans. Several classes of genetic variant
contribute to ASD liability, including de novo mutations (~3%), non-additive genetic variation
(~4%), rare inherited variation (~3%), and common inherited variation (~49%).5 Furthermore,
there were robust genetic and phenotype correlations between ASD, cognitive ability,
educational attainment, and several behavioral traits.4 The highly polygenic nature and relatively
high contribution of common genetic variation to ASD allude to a high degree of pleiotropy (i.e.,
a single genetic variant contributes small effects to several phenotypes or disorders) between the
genetic liability to ASD, cognitive traits, and behavioral phenotypes. While these pleiotropic
mechanisms have been investigated broadly, there is a paucity of data investigating the shared
genetic information between specific neuropsychiatric domains and ASD.
We investigated the relationship between ASD risk alleles and hundreds of
neuropsychiatric phenotypes in young probands from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
Cohort (PNC).6-9 Using polygenic risk scoring, we observed a significant positive relationship
between genetic liability to ASD and (1) the ability to recognize anger and (2) the change in
emotionality and connectedness with others. Conversely, we report a significant negative
relationship between the genetic liability to ASD and the ability to correctly distinguish the age
of others. These results highlight several features of human neurodevelopment in the young, such
as emotional intelligence, as key pathophysiological targets for ASD etiology.
Results
Neuropsychiatric Trait Prediction
The genetic liability for ASD was used to predict 491 neuropsychiatric phenotypes in
children not affected by ASD considering three age groups (young proband, N=1,035, age 8-10;
middle probands, N=2,499, age 11-17; and adult probands, N=775 age ≥18) of the PNC (Figure
1, Table S1).10

Polygenic risk for ASD significantly predicted the emotional intelligence phenotype
PEITANG (Penn Emotional Identification Test (PEIT) recognition of angry facial emotions) (zscore = 5.28, R2 = 1.06%, p = 1.38x10-7; Figure 1) after applying a false discovery rate multipletesting correction accounting for the number of phenotypes and PRS tested (N = 2,946,000 tests;
ASD PRS  PEITANG FDR q = 6.81x10-5) in subjects aged 11-17 years. The ability of ASD
PRS to predict PEITANG in the YP group nominally replicated with adult probands of mean age
19 ± 1.2 years (z-score = 2.10, R2 = 0.55%, p = 0.036). Combining the three age-stratified
samples, a stronger association of ASD PRS with PEITANG phenotype was observed (z-score
=5.69, R2 = 0.70%, p = 1.37x10-8). When binned by quartiles, there was a positive relationship
between increased polygenic risk for ASD and the ability to recognize angry faces where the
highest quartile had a 53% increase in the recognition of angry facial emotions when compared
with lowest quartile of the ASD PRS distribution (betaq4vs.q1 = 0.427, pq4vs.q1 = 1.42x10-6; Figure
1). The PEITANG trait was nominally significantly correlated with all other emotion recognition
traits and (0.007 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.378, 2.20x10-16 ≤ p ≤ 1.86X10-5) and four PEIT trial reaction times
(happy, sad, anger, and fear trial reaction times; 0.001 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.007, 2.87x10-8 ≤ p ≤ 0.038; Table
S2). To evaluate the relationship between ASD PRS and other PEIT emotion recognition tasks
independently from the most significant association observed, PEITANG was included as a
covariate in the model. After covarying for the effects of PEITANG, ASD PRS significantly
predicted the ability to recognize two other facial emotions in PEIT: happiness (z-score = -2.41,
R2 = 0.221%, p = 0.016) and neutral emotions (z-score = -2.05, R2 = 0.159%, p = 0.041; Figure
2). Furthermore, ASD PRS predicted PEITANG test reaction time (z-score = -2.08, R2 = 0.138%,
p = 0.038) and reaction time for happy facial emotion trials after covarying for the effects of
PEITANG (z-score = 2.21, R2 = 0.356%, p = 0.027; Figure 2). Conversely, the ability to decide
which of two faces displays a more severe emotion (as measured by The Penn Emotion
Differentiation Test (PEDT)) was poorly predicted by ASD polygenic risk (Figure S1).
Considering a suggestive threshold based on a false discovery rate correction accounting
for the number of phenotypes tested only (N = 491, FDR Q < 0.05), there were one, 30, and two
additional phenotypes predicted by genetic liability to ASD in the adult, middle, and young
proband groups, respectively (Table 2). The PNC traits SIP033 (Structural Interview for
Prodromal Symptoms: “Has anyone pointed out to you that you are less emotional or connected
to people than you used to be?”) and PADT_SAME_PC (Penn Age Differentiation Test: percent
of correct responses to trials with no age difference (60 total face pairs)) were predicted by ASD
polygenic risk in the adult (z-score = 3.76, R2 = 3.84%, p = 1.69x10-4) and young (z-score = 3.41, R2 = 1.06%, p = 5.08x10-04) probands, respectively (Figure 1). When binned by quartiles,
there was a 2.39-fold increase between highest quartile and lowest quartile of the ASD PRS
distribution in the odds of being told that you are less emotional/connected to people than
previously in the adult proband group (betaq4vs.q1 = 0.873, pq4vs.q1 = 0.015; Figure 1B) and a 2.22fold reduction in the percentage of total correct responses to age differentiation trials when no
age difference was present in the young proband group (betaq4vs.q1 = 0.799, pq4vs.q1 = 0.004;
Figure 1D).
Eight out of 30 suggestively significant phenotypes from the middle proband group were
nominally significantly correlated with PEITANG (0.002 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.378, 2.20x10-16 ≤ p ≤ 0.037,
Table S3). To verify that predicting these phenotypes using ASD PRS was independent of the
effects of PEITANG, PEITANG PRS was included as a covariate in each model. All 30
suggestively significant phenotypes from the middle proband group were significantly predicted
by ASD after covarying for PEITANG. With the exception of SIP011, these additional

suggestive relationships with ASD PRS had no change in effect after covarying for PEITANG
(Figure S2). The phenotype SIP011: SIPS-PRIME SCREEN-REVISED Structured Interview for
Prodromal Symptoms: I think I might feel like my mind is "playing tricks" on me was the only
phenotype demonstrating a significant increase in effect coefficient after covarying for
PEITANG (i.e., after covarying PEITANG, ASD PRS more strongly predicting SIP011; covaried
z-score = 5.06, R2 = 0.948%, p = 6.98x10-7; original z-score = 3.05, R2 = 0.358%, p = 0.002; zscoredifference = -2.37 pdifference = 0.020).
Influence of Related Brain Traits
To identify whether the association of the strongest genetically-predicted
neuropsychiatric phenotype (i.e., PEITANG) was attributable to the shared genetic liability of
ASD with other brain-related phenotypes rather than ASD per se, we next investigated the ability
of polygenic liability to brain imaging phenotypes,11 other psychiatric disorders (i.e., attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),12 anorexia nervosa,13 bipolar disorder,14 major depressive
disorder,15 Tourette syndrome,16 obsessive compulsive disorder,17 and schizophrenia18), and
educational attainment19 to predict PEITANG (Table 2 and Table S4). Among those traits, we
selected fourteen brain imaging phenotypes and four psychiatric disorders that were significantly
genetically correlated with ASD and included as covariates in evaluating the relationship
between ASD and PEITANG.20 To remove genetically redundant traits, covariates were selected
from genetically correlated trait pairs based on highest SNP-based heritability z-score (Figure 3)
resulting in a total of six brain imaging phenotypes (left cerebellar white matter volume, mean
diffusion tensor mode (MO) in sagittal stratum, mean L1 (i.e., strength of diffusion along the L1
principal axis of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)) in anterior limb of internal
capsule (right), mean L3 (i.e., strength of diffusion along the L1 principal axis of dMRI) in
uncinate fasciculus (left), right hemisphere central sulcus area, Left hemisphere cuneus gyrus
thickness; for complete description of image acquisition and brain mapping, refer to Miller, et al.
201621 and Elliot, et al. 201811), two psychiatric disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and schizophrenia), and education attainment. After covarying, the polygenic risk for
ASD significantly predicted the ability to recognize angry facial emotions in the middle proband
group, considering both one covariate at a time and including all covariates in the model (Figure
4). The effects of ASD PRS on the relationship between each covariate and PEITANG also was
considered. At matched GWS thresholds, the polygenic risk for schizophrenia, educational
attainment, and all six brain imaging phenotypes also maintained significant prediction of
PEITANG after covarying for ASD (Table 2). The relationship between the polygenic risk for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and PEITANG was not independent of the effects of ASD
PRS.
Predicting Informant Perception
Self-reported behavioral attributes (i.e., the person’s perception of their own trait or
behavior) may deviate from others’ perception of that same attribute.22 We use ASD polygenic
risk scores to evaluate informant perception of traits in the middle proband group and the
differences between perceived and self-reported phenotypes. After correction for multiple testing
based on the number of phenotypes tested (N = 507; FDR Q < 0.05), 24 informant-reported
phenotypes were significantly predicted by genetic liability to ASD. The most significantly
predicted informant-reported phenotype was PHB014: Specific Phobia: Thinking about all of the
time that you were afraid of (insert worst fear), whether or not you actually faced it, how long

did this fear last (Months)? (informant-reported PHB014: z-score = -3.86, R2 = 1.20%, p =
1.18x10-4) and agreed with the proband-reported effect direction after covarying for PEITANG
(proband-reported PHB014: z-score = -3.01, R2 = 0.156%, p = 0.001). The remaining 23
informant-reported phenotypes predicted by polygenic risk to ASD share general themes of
perceived poor mood and poor behavior of the child by the informant (Table S5). Of these 23
informant-reported phenotypes, three of the proband-reported counterparts also were
significantly predicted by ASD PRS after covarying for the effects of PEITANG, two of which
had consistent effect direction with the informant (SIP039: SIPS- Structured Interview for
Prodromal Symptoms: Within the past 6 months, are you having a harder time getting normal
activities done? and SCR006: General Probes: Are you currently taking medication because of
your emotions and/or behaviors?) and one with opposing effects directions relative to the
informant (PHB012: Specific Phobia: Thinking about all of the time that you were afraid of
(insert worst fear), whether or not you actually faced it, how long did this fear last? (Days)).
To evaluate differences in self- versus informant-perceived traits, 198 new phenotypes
were created, each with at least 500 PNC probands: the differences between 11-to-17-year-old
proband-reported behavior and 11-to-17-year-old informant-reported behavior. Polygenic risk
for ASD predicted 41 differences in self-reported and perceived neuropsychiatric phenotypes
(FDR Q < 0.05) which tend to highlight differences in outwardly visible traits such as attention
difficulties, eating abnormalities, and defiance of authority figures (Table S6). The phenotype
differences (see Methods) most strongly predicted by polygenic risk for ASD were Structured
Interview for Prodromal Symptoms (SIP) 039: “Within the past 6 months, are you having a
harder time getting normal activities done?” (z-score = 3.90, R2 = 0.591%, p=9.92x10-5) and
SIP025: “I think that I may hear my own thoughts being said out loud” (z-score = 3.96, R2 =
0.717%, p = 7.77x10-5). The top 10% of phenotypes with classification differences represented a
mean of 38.4% ± 3.82 of participants per phenotype classified differently by their informant, all
of which were representative of trait designation differences (e.g., the proband answered “yes”
while the informant answered “no”). Four phenotypes with classification differences were
significantly predicted by ASD PRS after correction for multiple testing (FDR Q < 5%):
DEP010: Depression: During that time when you were feeling the most (sad, grouchy, irritable,
in a bad mood, had trouble having fun), did that/those feeling(s) last most of the day? (z-score =
-2.73, R2 = 0.013%, p = 0.007), GAD003A: Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Please look at this
list and tell me if you worry a lot about: Your performance in school and/or sports (z-score = 3.06, R2 = 0.010%, p = 0.002), GAD017: Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Did you feel any of the
following physical symptoms when you worried the most: concentration problems (trouble
focusing or paying attention)? (z-score = 3.06, R2 = 0.018%, p = 0.002), SOC008: Social
Anxiety: Did this bother you more than most people your age? (z-score = -2.95, R2 = 0.013%, p
= 0.003).
Discussion
Accurate Recognition of Emotions
Polygenic risk for ASD predicted several aspects of facial emotion recognition in healthy
subjects aged 11 to 17 years old. Thus, our results tie the genetic risk for ASD pathology directly
to related traits in the normal population. We showed that ASD PRS was positively associated
with the ability to correctly recognize angry faces (i.e., PEITANG) when given the option of
angry, fearful, happy, neutral, or sad as delivered in PEIT. Negative facial emotion recognition
deficits are typically considered hallmark attributes of ASD cases1 although this is often

contested in the literature on the basis of different diagnostic instrument accuracy, ASD case
severity heterogeneity, and eye movement tracking frequency and accuracy.23, 24 Notably, after
covarying all other facial emotion recognition measure from PEIT on correctness in anger trials,
polygenic risk for ASD also predicted poor recognition of happy and neutral faces in others. We
speculate that this difference between angry and other facial emotions is linked to the increased
ability to recognize the emotions most familiar to the child. ASD toddlers experience more
intense anger than typically-developing (i.e., children not affected by ASD) and
developmentally-delayed children (defined by Macari, et al. as children with global or specific
language, communication, or motor delays)25, 26 but ASD severity was not associated with anger
intensity in these studies. Furthermore, caring for a child with ASD has been linked to increased
stress, anger, and salivary cortisol levels,27 providing additional mechanisms for prolonged anger
emotion exposure and heightened anger emotion memory in ASD youths (because the ASD child
may be evoking anger in a caregiver).
Animal data are convergent with human findings. In rats, the effects of early adversity
through caregiver-offspring interaction persisted into adulthood and manifested as altered
expression of the oxytocin receptor in the amygdala.28 Human oxytocin levels and the amygdala
brain region are robustly associated with emotional intelligence and have been implicated in
reduced attention to angry faces (in relation to depressive symptoms)29 and behavioral responses
to threat-emotions.30 We provide support for these observations using genetic data by identifying
that, after covarying for correct anger recognition, genetic risk for ASD predicted probandreported feelings of irritability (i.e., GAD018: Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Did you feel any of
the following physical symptoms when you worried the most: irritability (feeling easily
annoyed)?) with a positive effect direction (i.e., increased polygenic risk for ASD predicted more
self-reported irritability). Furthermore, the irritability phenotype was significantly positively
correlated with PEITANG suggesting that similar mechanisms or brain regions may act in similar
ways to modulate internalized anger versus perception of anger in others.
Speed of Emotion Recognition
Reaction times to recognize emotional faces also were measured with PEIT in the PNC.
We demonstrated that emotion recognition reaction time was significantly predicted by ASD
polygenic risk, though the magnitude of this effect was less than that of PEITANG. In this study,
ASD PRS predicted faster reaction times to anger and fearful faces and slower reaction time to
happy facial emotions. This is less explored in the ASD behavioral literature; however, there is
epidemiological evidence that ASD cases and typically-developing children both avoid
ruminating over facial emotion recognition tasks.31 Though not evaluated here, this
epidemiological observation suggests that the polygenic risk for ASD also may predict reaction
times to recognize facial emotions in ASD cases. This process has been linked to timed release
of cortisol following emotional task ques.32 Emotional intelligence capabilities may be dependent
on the context in which they are required. For example, conversational context clues and
caregiver behavior have demonstrated effects on emotional intelligence but are not effectively
reproduced in tests for emotion recognition and differentiation.28, 33, 34 Faster response to angry
and fearful faces is perhaps linked to induction of acute stress at times of social interaction in
youth. This stress has been linked to earlier visual processing following external stimuli35, 36,
which may be less present or less readily apparent when individuals are confronted with less
socially welcoming emotions like those of people with happy or neutral faces which were not
robustly predicted in this study.

Differentiating Emotion Intensity
Contrary to PEIT, PEDT shows participants two faces with the same emotion and asks,
for example, which face is “more afraid.” Deficits in this social cognition task may be influenced
by other contextual information from routine conversation not adequately incorporated into
emotion differentiation tasks (i.e., perception of body language,37 tone and pitch,38 peer group
interaction (i.e., ensemble perception),39 and familiarity with the interacting peer(s))40 and not
solely on the ability to recognize emotion or general neuropsychiatric features of the ASD
condition. While ASD PRS predicted recognition of angry faces and the speed with which these
faces were identified, it did not predict the ability to distinguish emotion severity differences
between faces if shown more than one (as measured by PEDT). This is an importantly distinct
task that is less well discussed in the ASD literature. Though not specifically evaluated here due
to our emphasis on youths unaffected by ASD, the absence of relationships between ASD
polygenic risk and measures of emotion severity differentiation perhaps emphasizes the
importance of conversational and environmental context clues from interpersonal interactions in
the perception of emotional severity by ASD cases.32
Effects of Other Brain and Psychiatric Phenotypes
The relationship between PRS for other psychiatric disorders and brain imaging
phenotypes also predicted angry emotion recognition. While the relationship between ADHD
and angry face recognition was not independent of the effects of ASD, genetic risk for
schizophrenia, educational attainment, and all six brain imaging phenotypes significantly
predicted the ability to recognize angry faces in others correctly. Genetic risk for schizophrenia,
educational attainment, cerebellar regions, the uncinate fasciculus, and cuneus were positively
associated with recognizing angry faces, perhaps even further highlighting the role of oxytocin,
stress, and anger on the brain.41, 42
After covarying for several additional brain phenotypes (schizophrenia, ADHD,
educational attainment, and six brain imaging phenotypes), the genetic risk for ASD remained
positively associated with the ability to correctly recognize angry faces. This observation
suggests that although PRS for other traits (e.g. schizophrenia) independently predicted
recognition of angry faces with greater magnitude than ASD PRS, the relationship between ASD
PRS and the ability to correctly recognize anger in others is independent of the effects of highly
genetically correlated traits with greater sample sizes.
Informant-Perceived Traits
Finally, we evaluated the genetic overlap between ASD polygenic risk and informantperceived traits in probands aged 11 to 17 years. There was a negative relationship between
genetic risk for ASD and perceived duration of fear of a specific phobia (PHB014) which was
consistent with the proband-reported phenotype. Notably, ASD PRS also predicted several
phenotypes we derived describing the difference between informant- and proband-reported
phenotypes. There was an overall lack of consistency in trait reporting with up to 38% of
probands classified differently by their informant (compared to their self-classification) with
respect to some PNC traits. This observation is not novel and reinforces the need for use of
several informants, where available. A majority of PNC middle proband informants were the
proband’s mothers; however, the setting in which behavior is observed may be very different
between informant mothers and, for example, informant teachers.43

Limitations
This study has two main limitations. First, the PNC evaluates broad aspects of human
neurodevelopment and with respect to social cognition only investigates facial stimuli at the
exclusion of gesture, vocalization, and complex social situations. Future work may investigate
the relationship between ASD PRS and higher resolution measures of social cognition. Second,
ASD cases were removed prior to polygenic risk scoring but the remaining proband groups likely
contain disproportionate ratios of disorders genetically correlated with ASD which may bias the
observed predictions in a direction that favors ASD PRS strongly predicting a PNC trait (i.e.,
false positives). Given the strength of the relationship between ASD PRS and PEITANG, this
potential bias likely lies within the phenotypes predicted by ASD PRS with nominal significance
(Figure 1). Even though these biases may influence the specific traits predicted by ASD PRS in
each proband group, the strongest relationship (ASD PRS and PEITANG) was replicable across
age groups.
Summary
We demonstrated that polygenic risk for ASD is associated with several neuropsychiatric
features of ASD-unaffected individuals: (1) the ability to correctly recognize angry faces
correctly in healthy youths and (2) the speed with which anger is recognized. Genetic risk for
ASD was not associated with the ability to differentiate the intensity of facial emotions. These
results were observed in a cohort without enrichment for specific neuropsychiatric phenotypes
and self- and informant-reported ASD cases were removed from our analyses.44 The data
presented support further investigation of how ASD risk alleles relate to psychopathology in
healthy and ASD patients. Considering epidemiological data regarding facial emotion
recognition, future work may investigate how ASD polygenic risk predicts correct recognition
and reaction time for emotion recognition and differentiation tasks in ASD cases.

neurocognitive battery administered to each participant provides measures of executive control
functions, episodic memory, complex cognitive processing, social cognition, and sensorimotor
and motor speed. For a complete list of neurobehavioral domains assessed, representing
approximately
900
phenotypes

participant,

The PNC consists of three proband groups classified by age (Table 1) and includes
information from a second visit of the middle proband age group. Phenotypes were included in
our analysis if they had ≥ 500 participants and effective sample size ≥ 50 (i.e., the number of
cases necessary to detect an effect weighted by the proportion of the binary categories). To
compare differences in informant-perceived versus self-reported phenotype, binary phenotypes
with yes/no responses were recoded as 1 (proband-reported and informant-reported “yes”), 2
(self-reported “yes” and informant-reported “no”), 3 (self-reported “no” and informant-reported
“yes”), and 4 (self-reported and informant-reported “no”). For quantitative traits, the new
phenotype represented the difference between proband-reported and informant-reported values
(i.e., proband value minus informant value). Ordinal phenotypes were recoded as 1 (more severe
rating by proband), 2 (proband and informant reported same rating), and 3 (more sever rating by
informant).
Probands were excluded from this study if they or their informant answered “yes” to
MED291: “Autism or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Do/did you have this problem?”
Based on answers to MED291, fewer than 5% of each proband group was removed from PRS
analyses.44
GWAS Quality Control
Preimputation quality control was performed in plink v1.9; briefly: (1) SNPs were
removed with call rate < 0.95; (2) Samples were removed with call rates < 0.95 and absolute
value inbreeding coefficients > 0.2, (3) SNPs were removed with call rates < 0.98 and HWE pvalues < 1x10-6. Individuals of European descent were confirmed on the basis of the genetic
information via principle component analysis using SNPs shared across all beadchips (N =
38,739 SNPs) and the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel for populations with European
ancestry (N=503). Cryptic relatedness among sample pairs was determined using a PI-HAT
threshold of 0.2. For sample pairs with PI-HAT > 0.2, the sample with more informative
phenotypes was retained. Imputation was performed for 4,309 unrelated individuals of European
ancestry using SHAPEIT for pre-phasing,45 IMPUTE2 for imputation,46 and the human 1000
Genomes Project Phase 3 as a reference panel. Samples were stratified by proband group
assignment in the PNC for PRS analyses (Table 1).
SNP-Heritability and Genetic Correlation
SNP-based observed-scale heritability and genetic correlation for PGC psychiatric
disorders and BIG brain imaging phenotypes were determined using the Linkage Disequilibrium
Score Regression (LDSC) method.20

Polygenic Risk Scoring
PRS based on ASD GWAS summary statistics were used to predict phenotypes in adult,
middle, and young proband groups from the PNC. Polygenic risk scoring was performed in
PRSice v210 with the default settings (i.e., SNPs were clumped based on 250kb windows on
either side of target SNP based on clump-r2 and clump-p thresholds of 0.1 and 1, respectively.
All PRS were covaried for age, sex, and the first ten principle components (PCs). PRS
predictions also were covaried using the PRS of UKB BIG brain imaging phenotypes and other
psychiatric disorders (Table S2) to detect whether the signals between ASD and PNC traits were
independent of the effects of additional psychiatric disorders, brain imaging phenotypes, and
educational attainment. The individual genetic liabilities to ASD for PNC participants were
binned into four quartiles and regressed against the dbGAP phenotype of interest using a
generalized linear model including the same covariates as the respective PRS prediction (i.e.,
age, sex, 10 PCs, and PRS of brain imaging phenotypes and psychiatric phenotypes where
appropriate). We applied a FDR multiple testing correction (FDR 5%) accounting for the number
of PRS thresholds tested and the number of phenotypes investigated (N = 2,946,000 tests).
Additionally, we considered as a suggestive significance a FDR multiple testing correction
accounting for the number of phenotypes tested only (N = 491).
Phenotype Correlation
Spearman’s correlation between phenotype measurements of the PNC were calculated in
R studio using the rcorr function of the Hmisc library. Correlation p-values were adjusted for
the number of tests performed using FDR Q < 0.05.
