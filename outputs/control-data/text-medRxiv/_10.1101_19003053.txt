Abstract

36

Purpose

37

To determine whether vessel density (VD) as measured by optical coherence tomography

38

angiography (OCT-A) provide insights into retinal and choriocapillaris vascular changes with

39

ageing and intermediate dry age related macular degeneration (AMD).

40

Methods

41

Seventy-five participants were recruited into three cohorts; young healthy (YH) group, old healthy

42

(OH) and those at high-risk for exudative AMD. Raw OCT and OCT-A data from TOPCON DRI

43

OCT Triton were exported using Topcon IMAGENET 6.0 software, and 3D datasets were

44

analysed to determine retinal thickness and vessel density.

45

Results

46

Central macular thickness measurements revealed a trend of overall retinal thinning with

47

increasing age. VD through the full thickness of the retina was highest in ETDRS sector 4 (the

48

inferior macula) in all the cohorts. Mean VD was significantly higher in the deep capillary plexus

49

than the superficial capillary plexus in all ETDRS sectors in all cohorts but there was no

50

significant difference noted between groups. Choriocapillaris VD was significantly lower in all

51

ETDRS sectors in the in the AMD group compared with the YH and the OH groups.

52

Conclusions

53

Retinal vessel density maps, derived from the retinal plexi are not reliable biomarkers for

54

assessing the ageing macular. Our non-proprietary analysis of the vascular density of the

55

choriocapillaris revealed a significant drop off of VD with age and disease but further work is

56

required to corroborate this finding. If repeatable, choriocapillaris VD may provide a non-invasive

57

biomarker of healthy ageing and disease.

Introduction

59

Currently we lack a reliable, non-invasive vascular biomarker to monitor both the “healthy”

60

ageing and disease progression of age related macular degeneration (AMD). Optical

61

coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) represents a novel, non-invasive, dye-less

62

retinal vascular imaging technique that can be rapidly acquired during a clinical consultation.

63

OCT-A is a progression of OCT, using repeated B-scans to detect motion contrast1. Based

64

on the assumption that this represents the movement of erythrocytes travelling through the

65

retinal blood vessels, the retinal vasculature can therefore be visualised.2 Previous studies

66

have shown the value of this imaging technique in the evaluation of glaucoma, diabetic

67

retinopathy (DR), retinal vein occlusions and AMD3.

68

The laminar structure of the retina lends itself to segmentation analysis. Histologically, the

69

retina has four retinal capillary plexuses, within the macular only three of these are

70

considered; the superficial, deep and intermediate capillary plexuses4, 5. When the macular

71

vasculature is imaged using OCT-A the vascular layers are segmented automatically by the

72

software. This results in the merging of the intermediate with the deep capillary plexus 3. The

73

regions of interest identified on the OCT-A therefore include the superficial capillary plexus

74

(SCP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP)3. The SCP consists of the vasculature within the

75

retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL). The DCP represents the

76

vascular plexuses present at two locations: These plexuses are at the border of the inner

77

nuclear layer and the outer plexiform layer, and the border of the inner plexiform layer and

78

inner nuclear layer6.

79

OCT-A images can be subjectively appraised for the presence of disease or post processed

80

to produce quantitative data that can be evaluated objectively. A number of studies7, 8 have

81

used perfusion indices such as vessel density and flow index9 as a method of quantitatively

82

analysing OCT-A images. Vessel density is defined as the “percentage area occupied by

83

vessels in the segmented area”9.Flow index is defined as “the average decorrelation values

84

in the segmented area”9. It has been proposed that these indices could be of value in

4

85

monitoring disease progression in AMD and DR7, 10, 11. When measuring vessel density, both

86

vessel length and diameter need to be considered. Poor perfusion can also result in vessel

87

dilation, therefore vessel density may not give complete information about the retinal

88

vascular status12.

89

There are a wide range of OCT-A devices available, each using a variety of algorithms to

90

capture retinal images. These include OCT-based optical micro-angiography (OMAG); split-

91

spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA); OCT angiography ratio analysis

92

(OCT-ARA); speckle variance; phase variance; and correlation mapping13. Specific OCT-A

93

models such as the AngioVue (Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) have inbuilt software for

94

perfusion indices calculation14. However, the majority of studies have applied post image

95

analysis in a variety of methods after the images are exported from the OCT-A instrument2.

96

This heterogeneity in the image capture and analysis means that data calculated using

97

different algorithms are not directly comparable, due to systemic difference and poor

98

agreement2. Therefore, external normative databases are unreliable and longitudinal

99

monitoring of disease using vessel density requires scans to be performed using the same

100

instrument, scan location and algorithm2.

101

The aims of this study are to compare the macular vessel density values for; young healthy,

102

old healthy, and patients with intermediate dry age related macular degeneration at high risk

103

of progression to exudative AMD, and to determine if these perfusion indices could usefully

104

serve as a biomarker for both “healthy” ageing and the identification of disease risk.

Materials and Methods

111

Seventy-five participants were recruited through Auckland Optometry Clinic and Milford Eye

112

Clinic, Auckland, New Zealand. All participants provided written informed consent prior to

113

imaging. Ethics approval (#018241) from the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics

114

Committee was obtained for this study. This research adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of

115

Helsinki.

116

Participants were divided into three groups, young healthy (YH) group, old healthy (OH) group

117

and the high-risk intermediate AMD group. Twenty participants were recruited into the YH group,

118

twenty-one were recruited into the OH group, and thirty-four recruited into the AMD group. A

119

comprehensive eye exam was conducted on each participant prior to the OCT and OCT-A scans

120

in order to determine high contrast BCVA and the ocular health status of the fundus. Patients

121

with any posterior eye disease that could potentially affect the choroidal or retinal vasculature

122

including, but not limited to glaucoma, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, DR, hypertensive

123

retinopathy, and high myopia (≥6D), were excluded from the study. Patients with any history of

124

neurological disorders were also excluded. The Young Healthy group consisted entirely of

125

individuals between the ages of 20 and 26 and a best corrected visual acuity of ≥6/9 in the eye

126

under test. The “Old Healthy” group consisted of individuals over the age of 55 years and who

127

had and a best corrected visual acuity of ≥6/9 in the eye under test. The “AMD group” consisted

128

entirely of patients with high risk intermediate dry AMD. This being diagnosed if the individual

129

had at least two of the following risk factors; reticular pseudodrusen, established neovascular

130

AMD in the fellow eye, confluent soft drusen with accompanying changes within the retinal

131

pigment epithelium. In order to ensure that all patients in the “AMD cohort” could maintain

132

fixation during OCT-A imaging, only those patients with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of

133

6/15 or better were enrolled. The mean age of the participants in the YH group, OH and AMD

134

participants were 23 ± 3, 65 ± 10 and 75 ± 8 years respectively. Only one eye of each patient

135

was used for the analysis, and if the patient had both eyes scanned, the OCT-A scan that was

136

the better quality (assessed subjectively by the clinical grader) of the two was used. Mean best-

137

corrected visual acuity for the YH, OH and AMD group were 6/6, 6/9, and 6/12 respectively.

138

The ocular health of all participants was assessed at Auckland Optometry Clinic, by a registered

139

optometrist, prior to enrolment in the study. The macular status of patients enrolled into the AMD

140

group was assessed separately by an experienced retinal specialist (DS).

141
142

Data collection protocol

143

Participants were dilated with 1.0% tropicamide if the pupils were deemed to be too small for

144

adequate OCT scans. Intraocular pressures were measured before and after dilation by iCare

145

tonometry. OCT/OCT-A scans, fundus photography and clinical measurements were all

146

performed at the University of Auckland Optometry Clinic, in a single session.

147
148

SS-OCT-A device and scanning protocol

149

The swept source OCT-A device (Topcon DRI OCT Triton, Topcon Corporation, Japan) was

150

used to obtain the OCT and OCT-A scans. A macular line and 3x3mm2 OCT, and 3x3mm2 OCT-

151

A scan were performed on each participant. All scans were cantered on the fovea, and retinal

152

layers were identified using the IMAGENET 6.0 automated layer detection tool so that the

153

superficial (SCP) and deep (DCP) capillary plexuses could be evaluated. The quality of the

154

generated layers were checked manually. Scan quality was evaluated at the time of acquisition,

155

and repeated if required.

156
157

Quantitative analysis of OCT-A Images

158

Raw OCT and OCT-A data were exported using Topcon IMAGEnet 6.0 software. Since OCT-A

159

images are only qualitative, we chose to normalize the OCT-A datasets, prior to further analysis.

160

These datasets were then correlated with vessel density in each retinal sector. OCT-A 3D

161

datasets were analysed in three different ways (outlined below), to investigate the retinal and

162

choroidal thickness and vessel density (VD).

163
164

1. ETDRS-specific

165

The nine Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) sectors were computationally

166

generated and centred manually by the clinical examiner, on the fovea (using enface OCT-A) for

7

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19003053; this version posted July 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

167

each participant. In some instances, the macular region was not in the centre of the enface

168

3x3mm2 OCT-A scan. Hence, after manual adjustment of the ETDRS central positioning on the

169

fovea, the outer ETDRS regions (i.e. 6-9) could have been positioned outside of the imaging

170

area. Therefore, in this study in which were interested in assessing the role vessel density may

171

play as a potential biomarker for ageing and disease of the central macular, we only used

172

ETDRS regions 1 to 5 for consistency in our analysis. In this process, the OCT-A signal is

173

extracted and saved for each ETDRS region, superimposed on every OCT-A enface layer. In

174

other words, all the 3x3mm2 OCT-A layers through the retinal thickness are combined to create

175

an OCT-A volume dataset, 920 of them per 3x3mm2 scan, using the Topcon DRI OCT. Finally,

176

the ETDRS regions are manually applied to each of the 920 enface OCT-A images and OCT-A

177

normalized data per region are extracted (see Figure 1). This method has been recently

178

published15.The averaged normalized vessel density (VD) of the full thickness retina and

179

choriocapillaris of each ETDRS region was then extracted from every participant for further

180

analysis. Normalisation was performed by converting the raw data to percentage of VD in all

181

ETDRS regions, throughout the thickness of the retina.

182
183

2. SCP, DCP and Choriocapillaris

184

Using the same ETDRS regions as above, the VD was extracted from layer 1 and 2 for the SCP

185

calculation, layers 3 and 4 for the DCP and layer 8 for the choriocapillaris. Averaged normalized

186

VD from the SCP, DCP and choriocapillaris was then extracted for each participant, in the three

187

groups.

188
189

3. Retinal and choroidal thickness

190

In addition to OCT-A data, we also recorded the foveal thickness and subfoveal choroidal

191

thickness from the OCT B-scans.

192
193

Statistical analysis

194

MATLAB programming software and custom-written code was used to import and analyse the

195

data, as detailed above. Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB Statistics Toolbox.

196

Due to unequal sample sizes between the sample groups, we performed the two sample non-

197

parametric Kolmogorov and Smirnov test, which is one of the most general nonparametric

198

methods for comparing two samples. The Kolmogorov and Smirnov method assumes that the

199

data in both groups follow Gaussian distributions. Significant differences between groups were

200

defined as D<0.565 for the Kolmogorov and Smirnov test.

254

Although a number of changes within the ageing macular have previously been reported, a

255

reliable, non-invasive biomarker of both “healthy” macular ageing and disease risk remains

256

elusive. Retinal thickness, both at the fovea and extra-foveal regions, has previously been shown

257

to differ significantly between individuals with early AMD and age-matched controls with the

258

retina being thinner in individuals with disease 16.The results of our study also revealed that there

259

was a trend for the overall retinal thickness to thin with age but this difference was not

260

statistically significant between cohorts. It is also recognised that the choroid tends to thin with

261

age; with the nasal area being thinnest, and the subfoveal region being thickest17. In addition to

262

thinning with “normal ageing,” Choroidal thinning has also been demonstrated in individuals with

263

early AMD compared to age matched controls 16, 18-20 however, the significance of this

264

observation is controversial as both the extent and the pattern of thinning is significant in some20

265

but not all studies

266

contradictory with some studies showing reduction in late AMD21 and others showing no

267

change19; moreover, the changes in the vasculature of the choriocapillaris in early AMD that

268

have been reported from histological studies 19, 21 appear to be independent of choroidal

269

thickness.

270

Similarly inconclusive observations have been reported with respect to the width of the Foveal

271

avascular zone with age. Whilst some studies report no difference with age22, 23 others have

272

found that the FAZ enlarges with increasing age 24, 25. Where reported, the FA at the level of the

273

SCP has been found to be significantly smaller in >60 year olds compared to younger study

274

groups 14, but the significant of this difference is unknown and furthermore no difference was

275

observed when the FAZ at the level of the DCP was analysed14. Recently, a study studying the

276

FAZ in patients with intermediate non-exudative AMD found no significant difference in the width

277

of the FAZ between patients with non-exudative AMD and healthy controls 26. We likewise found

278

there to be no statically significant difference in the diameter of the FAZ between any of the 3

279

cohorts studied.

280

Where objective measures of macular anatomy have failed, OCTA may provide an opportunity to

281

develop a reliable, non-invasive vascular biomarker of the ageing macular. The proprietary

282

OCTA software now has a vessel density function which, in brief uses the proportion of bright

283

pixels to the proportion of dark pixels to derive a measure of vascular density. In the first instance

284

we reviewed the mean vessel density percentage throughout the full retinal thickness, for each

285

ETDRS sector. We then used the segmentation function of the enface OCTA to explore the

286

relationship of the vessel densities within each of the ETDRS sectors 1-5 in each of the 3

287

vascular zones of the central macular; (SCP, DCP, Choriocapillaris) across the 3 cohorts; YH,

288

OH and AMD.

289

As one might expect the VD’s derived from the relatively avascular ETDRS sector 1 were, in the

290

full thickness maps, significantly reduced compared to the VD’s derived from ETDRS sectors 2-5

291

in the YH, OH, and AMD cohorts. However, and curiously, the VD recorded in the AMD cohort

292

was significantly higher than in the two “Healthy” cohorts, and whilst there was a trend for the

293

VD’s derived from the YH cohort to be reduced compared to the OH cohort, this difference was

294

not significant. Aside the marked difference between the AMD cohort and the other two “healthy”

295

cohorts, no other clinically relevant or statistically significant patterns were noted in the VD’s

296

derived from the full thickness retinal maps.

297

Overall, and when the retinal vascular complexes were analysed as separate segments, the

298

highest vessel densities were found in sectors 2 and 4; the superior and inferior macula. Again

299

the VDs derived from ETDRS sector 1 was greater in the AMD cohort compared to the two

300

“Healthy” cohorts. Whilst there was a trend for the VD’s derived from the OH cohort to be lower

301

compared to the YH cohort, this difference was not significant. The spatial variation in VD’s that

302

we observed; a higher mean VD in the inferior and superior EDTRS sectors and a lower mean

303

VD in the temporal and nasal sectors, in both the deep and superficial capillary plexi, is

304

consistent with published data from previous studies.14, 22, 23 Like others 14, 27, we also observed

305

that in all ETDRS sectors and in all 3 study groups, the mean VD derived from the DCP was

306

significantly higher than that derived from the SCP.

307

The association between age and vessel density remains unclear, with reports of statistically

308

significant lower mean vessel density in SCP, DCP and full thickness of retina in each ETDRS

309

sector in patients >60 years old compared to younger cohorts;14, however, others who have

310

studied this have found no such correlation22. On the whole, our results do not further our

311

understanding of VD changes with age, being similarly inconclusive. On the basis of these data,

312

one has to conclude that without further work, VD’s derived from the retinal segments are not a

313

reliable biomarker for “healthy” ageing.

314

One consistent feature of the VD’s derived from the retinal segments in the present study was

315

the finding that the VD’s recorded from ETDRS sector 1, and indeed in many other ETDRS

316

sectors in the AMD cohort, were as a group consistently higher than those obtained from the

317

“healthy” cohorts. One possible explanation for this surprising result is the technical challenges of

318

obtaining high quality OCT-A scans from individuals with even modest visual impairment as

319

accurate central fixation during the OCT-A capture can be challenging. Many of the patients in

320

our AMD cohort struggled to maintain fixation during the image acquisition stage, despite the

321

majority recording a Snellen acuity of 6/12. . Increased acquisition time and the resultant

322

compromise in image quality means there is a higher likelihood of projection and banding

323

artefacts.28 Motion artefacts can also lead to the duplication of inner retinal vascular structures

324

29

325

segmented area, errors such as vessel duplication and banding artefacts could be incorrectly

326

interpreted during computational analysis as increased vessel density within the image. Such an

327

error would be magnified in ETDRS sector 1 where the effects of these banding and motion

328

artefacts would be more pronounced in what should be avascular tissue.

329

Although the proprietary OCTA software to assess VD is designed to measure the inner retinal

330

plexi, a vascular bed which has a very different architecture to the choriocapillaris30 we were

331

curious to know whether the principle of VD analysis could be used to assess the vascularity of

332

the choriocapillaris. We therefore extracted the raw data, and then used a manual analysis

333

method previously published in the literature15, to assess the “Vascular density” of the

334

choriocapillaris segment. Even allowing for the influence of banding and motion artefacts,

335

issues which should increase VD measurements, we observed a significant reduction in the VD

336

in both the AMD and OH cohorts compared to the YH cohort with the reduction in VD being most

337

marked in the AMD cohort (Table 4). This contrasts sharply with the data derived from the retinal

338

plexi which broadly showed no difference between groups. Although interesting, one has to

339

interpret these findings with caution. It is possible that the observed reduction in VD is simply a

.As vessel density is derived from the percentage of the area occupied by bright pixels in a

340

result of increased projection artefact and as VD has, to the best of our knowledge, not

341

previously been used to assess the choriocapillaris, it is not possible to corroborate these

342

findings. However, a global reduction in choriocapillaris density, associated with drusen on OCT-

343

A in dry AMD has been demonstrated previously.6 It is also recognised that the inner choroid and

344

the choriocapillaris disproportionally thin with age and disease31. It is feasible that a thinning

345

choriocapillaris would be less vascular and other groups have hypothesised that choroidal

346

perfusion changes on the OCT-A, may predict disease progression6. Debate about whether this

347

is related to actual flow impairment6 or projection artefact “masking” the choriocapilaris29, 32 due

348

to large drusen or pigment epithelial detachments attenuating the OCT-A signal is still ongoing.

349

Without further corroborative work, the importance of our finding that there is a progressive

350

reduction in choriocapillaris VD in age and disease is difficult to assess. Furthermore, because

351

our old healthy group and AMD cohorts are not aged matched, it is not possible to comment on

352

whether any observed reduction is simply an ageing phenomenon or a marker of disease.

353

Nevertheless, if reproducible, such a measure has the potential to provide a non-invasive

354

biomarker of both “healthy” macular ageing and disease risk. Further limitations of this study

355

include a small sample size, which might reduce the generalisability of our findings and the

356

interpretation of the statistical significance of our data. Furthermore, the Kolmogorov and

357

Smirnov statistical test assumes the Gaussian distribution of the tested data.

358
359

Conclusion

360
361

OCT-A mean retinal vessel density results for normal subjects are in line with the existing

362

literature. Challenges of image acquisition and the significant influence of image artefact on post-

363

acquisition analysis of patients with mild visual loss due to intermediate age related macular

364

degeneration further limits the value of VD measurements in this patient group. Traditional

365

measures of vessel density, derived from the retinal plexi are therefore unreliable biomarkers for

366

both “healthy” ageing and quantifying risk of developing AMD. Our non-proprietary analysis of

367

the vascular density of the choriocapillaris revealed a significant drop off of VD with age and
