EMG of post-stroke gait asymmetry

Abstract
Objective: Asymmetric walking after stroke is common, detrimental, and difficult to treat, but current
knowledge of underlying physiological mechanisms is limited. This study investigated
electromyographic (EMG) features of temporal gait asymmetry (TGA).
Methods: Participants post-stroke with or without TGA and control adults (n=27, 8, and 9,
respectively) performed self-paced overground gait trials. EMG, force plate, and motion capture data
were collected. Lower limb muscle activity was compared across groups and sides (more/less affected).
Correlation between burst timing variables and asymmetry ratios was examined.
Results: Significant group by side interaction effects were found: fewer TGA group dorsiflexor bursts
during swing (p=.0009), more affected plantarflexor stance activity ended early (p=.0006) and less
affected dorsiflexor on/off time was delayed (p<.01) in persons with asymmetry compared to
symmetric and normative controls. Less affected side EMG timing correlated most with swing time
ratio (r=0.68-0.90, p<.001).
Conclusions: Temporal patterns of muscular activation, particularly about the ankle around the stanceto-swing transition period, are associated with TGA. The results may reflect specific impairments or
compensations that affect locomotor coordination.
Significance: Neuromuscular underpinnings of spatiotemporal asymmetry have not been previously
characterized. These novel findings may inform targeted therapeutic strategies to improve gait quality
after stroke.

EMG of post-stroke gait asymmetry

1. Introduction
Functional mobility is often affected after stroke due to impairments in walking, which can
restrict activity and participation (Andrenelli et al. 2015). Therefore, improving hemiparetic gait is a
major focus of rehabilitation (Jette et al. 2005; Latham et al. 2005) and patients’ top goal (Bohannon et
al. 1988). While speed and endurance may increase with physical therapy, ambulatory dysfunction
often persists; more than half of community-dwelling individuals with chronic stroke walk
asymmetrically (Patterson et al. 2008a). This has clinical implications; a number of long-term negative
consequences have been proposed (Patterson et al. 2008a), including musculoskeletal pathology
(Jorgensen et al. 2000; Norvell et al. 2005; Beaupre and Lew 2006), falls due to instability (Lewek et
al. 2014; Lien et al. 2017), and inefficient energy consumption (Ellis et al. 2013; Awad et al. 2015)
leading to reduced activity (Michael et al. 2005). Furthermore, walking appearance is important to
people with stroke (Bohannon et al. 1991). Unfortunately, asymmetric gait can be resistant to
intervention (Patterson et al. 2015) and may even worsen over time (Turnbull and Wall 1995; Patterson
et al. 2010a).
Spatiotemporal parameters are used to describe the quality of hemiparetic gait and may indicate
specific biomechanical deficits or compensations (Allen et al. 2011) with respect to kinetics (Kim and
Eng 2003), coordination (Wonsetler and Bowden 2017), and muscle function (Balasubramanian et al.
2007). Temporal gait asymmetry (TGA), measured as a ratio of the more and less affected side swing
(or stance) time, is related to paretic ankle muscle strength and spasticity (Hsu et al. 2003; Lin et al.
2006) as well as lower limb impairment due to stroke (Brandstater et al. 1983; Patterson et al. 2008b);
however, these findings are limited by the use of gross clinical assessments or conditions that are not
fully reflective of complex gait dynamics. Good motor recovery or fast walking speed does not
necessarily imply symmetry and age is not a factor (Patterson et al. 2008b, 2012). More ecologically
valid and direct measurements are necessary to reveal the underlying neural mechanisms or adaptation
strategies that result in TGA. With better understanding of this detrimental outcome of stroke, novel
targeted therapy can be developed to improve symmetry and advance the field of gait rehabilitation.
Surface electromyography (EMG) has long been used to study neuromuscular control of
locomotion after stroke. Recorded muscle activity, representing nervous system output, can be
quantified in various ways and compared with healthy controls or the less-affected side in the context
of hemiparesis to elucidate the resulting aberrant motor behaviour. Despite considerable inter-subject
variability (Knutsson and Richards 1979), some common impairments have been identified (Olney and
Richards 1996): absence or reduced amplitude of tibialis anterior activation, prolonged quadriceps and
hamstring firing, and premature calf muscle onset. Lower limb agonist/antagonist co-contraction and
synergistic coordination during hemiparetic walking have also been examined (Rosa et al. 2014). Yet,
the association of these patterns with gait symmetry has not been directly investigated. It is still unclear
how neurophysiological changes due to stroke affect the quality of gait. This study aimed to determine
whether lower limb muscle activity and timing (i.e. burst on/offset) in persons with TGA is different
than symmetric post-stroke individuals and healthy adults. The results could elucidate specific EMG
patterns during overground walking that underlie temporal asymmetry as well as inform future clinical
approaches to gait assessment and treatment.
2. Methods
2.1 Design and subjects
This study was a cross-sectional analysis of data from two research trials approved by the
University Health Network Research Ethics Board (study IDs 14-7428 and 15-9523). Both examined
community-dwelling individuals with stroke. The first was a randomized controlled trial of
perturbation training (registration #: ISRCTN05434601) (Mansfield et al. 2015) from April 2014 to
August 2017. Of the 90 enrolled participants, 20 completed a gait assessment (see below). The second,
an ongoing observational study of gait and rhythm ability that began July 2016, also included healthy

adult volunteers (n=10 control subjects plus 29 individuals with stroke at the time of this publication).
All participants in the current study were able to walk 10 m without a gait aid or physical assistance.
Relevant exclusion criteria were: pre-existing or other neurological or musculoskeletal condition(s)
significantly impacting gait (e.g. osteoarthritis, Parkinson’s disease); cognitive, language or
communication impairment; and recent major illness, injury, or surgery. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants prior to data collection.
2.2 Data collection and assessment procedures
2.2.1 Demographics and clinical assessment
The following information, as applicable, was recorded at the time of enrolment: age, sex, time
post-stroke, stroke location, and pre-morbid medical history. Participants with stroke also underwent a
battery of standardized clinical tests administered by a trained research assistant. Relevant to this study,
the Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) was used to measure motor impairment of the
lower extremity; this tool has good reliability and concurrent validity (Gowland et al. 1993).
2.2.2 Overground gait
Detailed gait assessment was conducted at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute in FallsLab, a 6 m x
3 m movable platform (static for the duration of data collection) equipped with passive motion capture
(Vicon Motion Systems Ltd, Oxford, UK). Participants were full-body outfitted with reflective markers
on anatomical landmarks (only one was used for kinematic analysis, see 2.3.1). An eight-channel
wireless EMG system (Noraxon USA Inc., Scottsdale, Arizona, USA) measured activity from four
pairs of lower limb muscles. Electrodes were placed bilaterally on clean skin (abraded and swabbed
with rubbing alcohol) according to SENIAM recommendations (Hermens et al. 2000) and Criswell
locations (Cram and Kasman 2011) for tibialis anterior (TA, lateral to the tibia approximately 1/3 of the
distance between the ankle and knee), medial gastrocnemius (MG, 2 cm medial to the midline just
distal from the knee), rectus femoris (RF, middle of the thigh approximately halfway between the knee
and anterior superior iliac spine), and biceps femoris (BF, 2 cm lateral to the midline approximately
halfway between the gluteal fold and posterior knee). Participants walked at a self-selected pace across
a platform comprised of eight (two by four) 1.5 m x 1.5 m force plates (Advanced Mechanical
Technology Inc., Watertown, Massachusetts, USA) while wearing an integrated active safety harness
that allowed free movement without providing body weight support. Only the middle two pairs of force
plates (four total) actively recorded, but gait was initiated before and terminated after (approximately 1
m) to allow for acceleration and deceleration. Five or six trials (depending on study protocol) were
performed from the same marked starting point to position participants such that the right foot landed
on the right side of the platform and vice versa. Rest breaks were given as needed. Force plate and
electromyographic data were sampled at 250 Hz and 1000 Hz, respectively, synchronously with a
custom Simulink (The Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) program, and stored for offline
processing. Motion files were captured separately at 100 Hz using the manufacturer’s Nexus software
(Vicon Motion Systems Ltd, Oxford, UK).
2.3 Data processing and analysis
2.3.1 Gait parameters
Force plate and motion capture data (labelled in Vicon Nexus v.1.8.5) were processed with
Visual 3D v.5 (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, Maryland, USA). After applying a zero-lag 4th-order
Butterworth low-pass filter (cutoff frequency: 25 Hz) (Winter 1990; Kram et al. 1998), vertical ground
reaction forces were analyzed to determine foot-on and -off times using a 20 N threshold, then
confirmed via visual inspection. Gait events for all but the first trial (to account for familiarization to
the assessment procedure) (Boudarham et al. 2013) were extracted following visual inspection. One
stride or gait cycle was between consecutive foot-on events and stance was the phase from foot-on to

foot-off (expressed in absolute duration and as a percent of stride). Left and right swing times were
computed as the duration between foot-off and the subsequent foot-on, then averaged over all strides.
The swing time ratio (larger of the left and right side mean values in the numerator) served as the
measure of TGA (Patterson et al. 2010b). Gait velocity was derived from the anterior motion of one
pelvis marker (interpolated then low-pass Butterworth filtered at 6 Hz) (Yang and Pai 2014) and the
average global magnitude was calculated for each processed trial.
2.3.2 Electromyography
Custom programs written in MATLAB (R2015b; The Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts,
USA) were used to process raw EMG recordings after visual inspection for data quality. A zero-lag 4thorder bandpass Butterworth filter with cutoff frequencies of 10 Hz and 300 Hz was applied, followed
by detrending, rectification, and low-pass filtering at 30 Hz (zero-lag 4th-order Butterworth) (Merletti
1999). The processed signal was scanned for EMG bursts, as defined by amplitude above the trial mean
for at least 30 ms. Bursts that were separated by less than 30 ms were merged, as shorter muscle
activations are generally considered to have no biomechanical effect (Bogey et al. 1992). These
threshold parameters identified periods of activity with a balance of specificity and sensitivity such that
the output appeared to accurately represent the raw data (Figure 1). Timing of the beginning (ON) and
end (OFF) of the bursts from each muscle were extracted after visual inspection of every stride, and
then expressed as a percentage of stride relative to the respective foot-on event (i.e., start of stance
phase). Normative muscle activity patterns were identified from the healthy adult control data and
allowed classification of bursts with respect to the phase of gait (i.e., stance and swing) as described
below. A burst that began during stance and ended in the swing phase was considered part of the
stance-to-swing transition period.
2.4 Statistical analysis
Participants with stroke were classified as either symmetric or asymmetric in swing time ratio
based on the normative threshold of 1.06 (Patterson et al. 2010b). The more and less affected sides
were designated according to self-report and clinical presentation. For the control adults, limbs were
differentiated by swing time (higher = ‘more affected’, lower = ‘less affected’). Consequently, there
was a between-subject factor of group (three levels: asymmetric, symmetric, and controls) and a
within-subject factor of side with two levels. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA)
software was used to describe the data (mean and standard deviation for continuous measures;
frequency and percentages for categorical variables) and to perform statistical tests. Burst count
outcomes were analyzed using negative binomial regression with group, side, and group*side as
predictors. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed on the gait parameters and burst timing
continuous variables that approximated a normal distribution after visual examination. A random
effects linear regression model with random intercept was applied to test the effects of group, side, and
group*side interaction (different covariance structures allowed). Pairwise comparisons were examined
and the initial p<.05 level of significance was adjusted with a Bonferroni correction. Non-normally
distributed variables were dichotomized but ultimately omitted as the results of logistic regression were
unreliable (due to small counts). The relationship between swing time ratio and the timing variables
that were significantly different in the asymmetric group was measured by Spearman correlation.
3. Results
Six of the 20 and eight of the 29 participants with stroke enrolled in the randomized controlled
trial and observational study, respectively, and one control adult were excluded from this analysis due
to poor data quality or incomplete collection. Therefore, the final sample size was 35 post-stroke
individuals, of whom 27 exhibited TGA, and nine control adults. In total, 485 strides over 188 trials
were analyzed.

3.1 Demographics and clinical assessment
Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. Asymmetric individuals generally walked
slower and presented with lower CMSA scores compared to those who were symmetric. The inverse
relationship of spatiotemporal gait asymmetry with gait speed and motor function/recovery is wellestablished (Lauzière et al. 2014). There was a higher proportion of primarily left side impairment in
the asymmetric than symmetric group, which may be due to the eligibility criteria selecting for
individuals without the language or communication deficits that more often accompany right-sided
paresis. TGA was in the direction of the more affected side (longer swing time), as is commonly found
(Lauzière et al. 2014). Half of the symmetric group presented with longer swing times on the less
affected side.

3.2 Temporal gait parameters
Overall, the more affected side of the asymmetric group had the longest swing time (significant
interaction effect, p<.0001; Figure 2A). A significant main effect of group was found for absolute
stance time (p<.0001; Figure 2A). Since the longer duration of the asymmetric participants could be, at
least partly, attributed to gait speed as a confounding factor (Olney and Richards 1996), stance as a
percent of stride was also examined. There was a group*side interaction effect (p<.0001; Figure 2B),
with the less affected side of the asymmetric individuals having a significantly higher stance proportion
(pairwise comparisons p<.0001).

3.3 Muscle burst activity
Using the control adult data as a normative template, the following muscle bursts were defined
based on the temporal location in the gait cycle (ST=stance, STW=stance-swing transition period,
SW=swing phase): TA-ST, TA-STW, TA-SW (Figure 3); MG-ST, MG-SW (occasionally present)
(Figure 4); RF-ST, RF-STW (frequently absent), RF-SW (Figure 5); BF-ST1 (early first burst), BFST2 (sometimes a later second burst), BF-SW (Figure 6). The prevalence of each burst by group and
side is shown in Table 2.

EMG of post-stroke gait asymmetry

The overall muscle activity pattern of the symmetric group was similar to controls, but the later BFST2 burst was rarely detected in both lower limbs (significant group effect for the number of BF bursts
during stance, p=.039). In the asymmetric group, most participants exhibited a MG-SW burst on the
more affected side. A main effect of group (p=.0009) for the number of TA-SW bursts was found; the
asymmetric individuals had significantly fewer than the symmetric group (p=.014) and control adults
(p=.001). There was also a group effect on the MG-ST burst variable (p=.032) but no significant
pairwise differences were found.

than less affected side in all groups (p=.011). A significant interaction effect for the end of the MG-ST
burst (MG-ST OFF, p=.0006) was found: the more affected side of the asymmetric individuals was
early compared to the symmetric and control adults. The stance-to-swing transition burst of TA on the
less affected side was shifted significantly later for the asymmetric participants relative to the other
groups (pairwise comparisons: TA-STW ON, p≤.0001; TA-STW OFF, p<.01). There was also a
significant interaction effect for the timing of the RF-STW burst; when present, it was delayed on the
less affected side of the asymmetric individuals (pairwise comparisons: RF-STW ON, p=.0018-.045;
RF-STW OFF, p=.037-.29). The start of RF swing phase activity (RF-SW ON) in the asymmetric
participants was significantly earlier than the symmetric (p=.020).

and C-MA), symmetric (S-LA and S-MA) and asymmetric (A-LA and A-MA) individuals. Filled bars
represent bursts (ON/OFF timing is mean percent of stride) and unfilled bars indicate stance phase.

3.5 Correlation between asymmetry and muscle burst timing
Within the asymmetric group, the variables that correlated most with swing time ratio were the
stance phase MG burst OFF time on the less affected side (MG-ST OFF: rs=0.68, p=<.0001), and the
timing of the TA and RF bursts on the less affected side during the stance-to-swing transition (TASTW ON: rs=0.90, p<.0001; TA-STW OFF: rs=0.73, p=.0003; RF-STW ON: rs=0.86, p=.0001; RFSTW OFF: rs=0.87, p=.0001).
4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to explore the neuromuscular mechanisms underlying TGA,
which had not yet been directly characterized at this dynamic physiological level. Lower limb EMG
during overground walking revealed differences in burst prevalence and on/offset time between persons
with TGA, symmetric post-stroke individuals and control adults. Notably, the asymmetric group
exhibited fewer TA-SW bursts, early MG-ST OFF timing on the more affected side, and delayed
activity of the less affected TA from stance to swing. The findings suggest that certain

EMG of post-stroke gait asymmetry

electromyographic patterns are associated with swing time asymmetry and, therefore, may be important
targets for intervention to improve gait quality after stroke.
As a cerebrovascular accident can disrupt descending neural inputs that direct movement, the
presence of key muscle activations throughout the gait cycle was determined. The symmetric group
exhibited a very low prevalence of the second BF stance burst (BF-ST2), which cannot be explained by
slowness associated with reduced hamstrings activity and terminal hip extension (Neptune et al. 2008)
because walking speed was equivalent to controls. Late BF activation was only present in two
individuals, who also lacked a RF-STW burst, suggesting reciprocal coordination of these knee
muscles. In contrast to the other groups, most of the asymmetric participants had an MG burst during
the swing phase in the limb with greater impairment. A possible explanation for this excess activity is
plantarflexor spasticity, previously found to be associated with TGA (Hsu et al. 2003). The lower
number of TA-SW bursts in the group with asymmetry, particularly on the more affected side, may
underlie the dorsiflexor weakness reported in earlier work (Lin et al. 2006). Thus, specific gross EMG
patterns seem to reflect symmetry status in persons with stroke.
While quantifying muscle bursts provides some useful information about subsequent
biomechanical output, timing of neuromuscular activity more directly relates to the resultant
parameters associated with TGA. The differences in stance time described above (significant main
effects of group and side) are consistent with the delayed asymmetric TA-ST OFF and late MG-ST ON
in the less affected limb. Prolonged stance phase activation of TA in the asymmetric participants
contributed to considerably greater overlap with the MG burst (17% of stride vs 0-2% in the symmetric
and control adults). This period of co-contraction may provide ankle stabilization during the loading
response and transition to swing. Earlier MG-ST ON time on the more versus less affected side in both
stroke groups suggests a Type I pattern of premature activity, first described by Knutsson and Richards
(Knutsson and Richards 1979), that may be caused by calf muscle lengthening as dorsiflexion
increases. However, this interlimb difference was also seen in the control adults, which argues against
an effect of pathological spasticity, but it does help explain the overall lower stance time on the more
affected sides. While MG-ST OFF timing was significantly early in the more impaired limb of
individuals with TGA, on average, number and total duration of the burst(s) was not reduced,
indicating an intact ability to activate the muscle. In fact, the less affected side of the asymmetric
participants had the most and longest-lasting MG-ST bursts - perhaps a compensation for generating
enough propulsion to advance through swing phase quickly and reduce the time in single-support on
the opposite limb. The late shift of the MG-ST and TA-STW bursts in the asymmetric group’s less
affected side likely underlies the greater stance proportion of stride as a major driver of TGA, with the
ON/OFF timing highly correlated to swing time ratio. A significant interaction effect and strong
correlation with asymmetry was also found for the less affected RF-STW ON and OFF time, but since
this burst was present in fewer than half of the asymmetric individuals (potentially related to slow
walking (Nene et al. 1999)), it probably has limited impact on gait quality.
Since TGA is a problem of timing, an on/off detection method was used to analyze temporal
features of the EMG data, which precluded quantitative interpretation of signal intensity; however, the
relationship between swing asymmetry and force-generating capacity has previously been investigated
(Kim and Eng 2003). Normalizing to the mean amplitude across a trial has been recommended for
reliable task-specific examination, especially in patients with neurological disorders who have
difficulty with voluntary contraction (Burden 2010). As the threshold for muscular activation, this may
have reduced inter-subject variability, but between-group differences were still found and normative
EMG profiles herein generally matched overall reference patterns from the literature (Shiavi 1985;
Benedetti et al. 2012). Although only four muscle pairs were measured, taken together, both flexion
and extension actions across all three major lower limb joints (i.e., ankle, knee and hip) were
represented, so a relatively comprehensive picture of locomotor control could be obtained.

EMG of post-stroke gait asymmetry

The findings of this study add important mechanistic insight about TGA and have implications
for therapeutic management. Previous work has focused on a shortened non-paretic swing phase and
proposed underlying impairments of forward propulsion and/or balance control during paretic limb
support (Lauzière et al. 2014). For the asymmetric participants herein, stance time was increased
overall and as a percentage of their less affected stride, implying a preference for stability through
weight-bearing on the ‘better’ leg. Correlational analyses have revealed that TGA has significant
associations with measures of standing and dynamic balance (Hendrickson et al. 2014; Lewek et al.
2014); further investigation should explore whether practising these tasks can improve symmetry. The
temporal gait parameters can be well-accounted for by the EMG patterns observed, specifically of TA
and MG activity around the stance-to-swing transition. Burst timing of the more affected side was
generally similar to the control adults, suggesting that neurophysiological deficits in this respect were
minimal. While some indirect evidence for the involvement of ankle impairments (weakness,
spasticity) was found, swing time ratio was most correlated to the ON/OFF time of muscles on the less
affected side, which could be actively generating the asymmetry. Biomechanical compensations in the
non-paretic limb are known to develop after stroke and can persist into later stages of recovery (Den
Otter et al. 2007; Raja et al. 2012). As a result, it is unclear whether the lower CMSA scores in the
group with versus without TGA represent residual neuromotor dysfunction or learned non-use. Muscle
activity of asymmetric individuals may have adapted to favour the less affected side for weight-bearing
and produce a preferred (consciously or not) gait pattern that was reinforced with ‘practice’.
Asymmetry has been resistant to various interventions, but repetitive task-specific training is a
promising way to restore coordination (Hollands et al. 2012). Therapeutic strategies that incorporate
temporal cuing for interlimb synchronization may be more effective at promoting favourable
adaptation. An early investigation into the effect of rhythmic auditory stimulation demonstrated
improvements coinciding with normalization of gastrocnemius activation (Thaut et al. 1993). Another
study showed an immediate reduction in asymmetry and electromyographic changes through treadmill
walking (Harris-Love et al. 2004), implying an inherent capacity for better use of the more affected
limb. Yet other work found invariant timing of paretic muscle activity during rehabilitation, suggesting
that functional recovery is due to compensation (Den Otter et al. 2006; Buurke et al. 2008). However, if
clinical measures (e.g. walking speed, mobility index, ambulation category) are improved at the
expense of symmetry, proactive remediation of coordination patterns should also be a focus to avoid
negative consequences for the patient. Ultimately, an individualized approach may be necessary to
address the variety of problems that arise from stroke. Incorporating EMG recordings in future research
would allow clinical assessment and treatment to directly target the neural input that determines the
quality of gait.
5. Conclusion
Despite the high prevalence among persons with stroke, gait asymmetry is not well-understood
and thus, difficult to manage clinically. To investigate the level of neuromuscular input, EMG from
asymmetric, symmetric and control participants while overground walking was directly analyzed.
Through this novel and detailed characterization of underlying lower limb muscle activity, important
patterns associated with TGA were revealed. Differences in the temporal organization of bursts
between study groups may account for specific impairments and compensations in the more and less
affected limbs, respectively, that contribute to poor gait quality. The results of this study can be used to
inform rehabilitation practice with the goal of promoting symmetry and avoiding negative outcomes
after stroke.
