ABSTRACT

28
29

Background. The importance of specific serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease

30

(IPD) differs by age. Data on pneumococcal carriage in different age groups, along with data

31

on serotype-specific invasiveness, could help to explain these age-related patterns and their

32

implications for vaccination.

33
34

Methods. Using pneumococcal carriage and disease data from Israel, we evaluated the

35

association between serotype-specific IPD in adults and serotype-specific carriage

36

prevalence among children in different age categories, while adjusting for serotype-specific

37

invasiveness. We used a sliding window approach to estimate carriage prevalence using

38

different age groupings. Deviance Information Criterion was used to determine which age

39

groupings of carriage data best fit the adult IPD data. Serotype-specific disease patterns

40

were further evaluated by stratifying IPD data by comorbidity status.

41
42

Results. The relative frequency of serotypes causing IPD differed between adults and

43

children, and also differed between older and younger adults and between adults with and

44

without comorbidities. Serotypes over-represented as causes of IPD in adults were more

45

commonly carried in older children as compared to younger children. In line with this, the

46

serotype-specific frequency of carriage in older children (aged 36-59 months), rather than

47

infants, best correlated with serotype-specific IPD in adults.

48
49

Conclusions. These analyses suggest that older children, rather than infants, are the main

50

drivers of disease patterns in adults. These insights could help in optimizing vaccination

51

strategies to reduce disease burden across all ages.

INTRODUCTION

53

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a frequent colonizer of the upper respiratory

54

tract of healthy children and is also a major cause of disease globally. The burden of

55

pneumococcal disease disproportionally affects infants and the elderly and those with certain

56

underlying comorbidities [1]. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) provide protection

57

against 10 or 13 of the 90+ immunologically-distinct polysaccharide capsular types

58

(serotypes), preventing disease and reducing colonization of the nasopharynx in vaccinated

59

individuals. Since children who carry pneumococcus are the main source of exposure for

60

adults [2–4], vaccinating children with PCVs has also resulted in the near-elimination of

61

invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by vaccine-targeted serotypes (VTs) among

62

adults [5].

63
64

Even before the introduction of PCVs, there were important differences in the distribution of

65

serotypes causing IPD between children and adults [6]. For instance, VTs caused a larger

66

fraction of IPD in children. After introduction of PCVs, non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) have

67

increased in frequency among colonized children. This “serotype replacement” [7] has had a

68

modest effect on IPD rates in children but has substantially reduced the indirect benefits for

69

adults that result from vaccinating infants. Older adults and those with certain underlying

70

diseases have proven particularly susceptible to disease caused by emerging NVTs [8–10].

71

In some countries, the increase in the incidence of NVTs in adults has offset declines in the

72

incidence of VTs [11].

73
74

Variations in vaccine approach and schedule could have important implications for

75

preventing IPD in adults. Currently, the number and timing of doses used in children differs

76

between countries, as does the use of a booster dose. For instance, the United Kingdom

77

recently decided to move to a reduced-dose schedule of PCVs in infants, where children

78

receive a single priming dose and a single booster dose [12]. For such a strategy to be

79

effective in maintaining indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, it is important that

80

vaccine-derived protection is maintained among the children responsible for transmission in

81

the population. Thus, identifying those age groups driving transmission is critical. Moreover,

82

these issues are increasingly important as new 15- and 20-valent conjugate vaccines move

83

towards licensure.

84
85

It is generally assumed that most exposure to pneumococcus in adults results from contact

86

with children [13]. However, children are not all equally likely to carry and transmit

87

pneumococcus, and some groups of children (e.g., preschoolers) might be more influential

88

due to different contact patterns and intensity of carriage [13–15]. Recent work suggests that

89

older children, rather than infants, transmit pneumococcus to adults [13–15].

90
91

In this study, we sought to understand drivers of the variations in the distribution of serotypes

92

causing IPD by age and in those with and without comorbidities. We evaluated variations in

93

the serotype distribution in IPD by age and comorbidity, and we tested which age groups of

94

children had serotype patterns in carriage that were most closely correlated with IPD rates in

95

adults. These analyses could help in optimizing vaccine strategies to reduce pneumococcal

96

disease across all age groups.

METHODS

100
101

Data sources

102

PCV7 was introduced in Israel in July 2009 using a 2+1 schedule with a catch-up campaign

103

for children <24 months of age. PCV7 was replaced in the schedule by PCV13 starting in

104

November 2010 (without a catch-up). Details of the carriage and IPD data used in this study

105

have been previously described [14,16,17]. Briefly, the carriage data were collected from

106

children visiting the emergency department (ED) at Soroka University Medical Center, the

107

only emergency department in southern Israel. The first 4 Jewish and first 4 Bedouin

108

children <5 years of age visiting the ED each day for any complaint were enrolled in the

109

study to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab. IPD data were obtained from a nationwide

110

surveillance system [16,18]. The carriage and IPD studies were approved by the Sheba

111

Medical Center and the Soroka University Medical Center Institutional Review Boards (IRB).

112

Data in the current study was de-identified before analysis.

113
114

Carriage and disease data were divided into 4 equal time periods (Early-PCV7: November

115

2009 to July 2011, Early PCV13: August 2011 to February 2013, Late-PCV13: March 2013

116

to October 2014, Stable-Post-PCV period: November 2014 to June 2016). IPD data from

117

4,304 individuals were stratified by age group (<5 [n=1,180], 5-17 [n=299], 18-39 [n=407],

118

40-64, [n=943] 65-79 [n=816], 80+ [n=658] years) and according to comorbidity status (no

119

risk, at risk, or high risk for pneumococcal disease [18]) based on recommendations for

120

receipt of PPV23. Risk group analyses were conducted on individuals aged 18+ years who

121

had information on comorbidity status, serotype, and sample collection date. Period 4 for the

122

subset of data with comorbidities ended December 2015 (as compared to June 2016 for the

123

full dataset).

124
125

The carriage data were stratified by both ethnicity (Jewish versus Bedouin) and according to

126

presence or absence of recorded complaints that could be caused by pneumococcus

127

(bacteremia, conjunctivitis, influenza, LRI, meningitis, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, URI)

128

to confirm results were not sensitive to these factors.

129
130

Modeling the relationship between carriage in children and invasive disease in adults

131

The goal for these analyses was (1) to evaluate variations in serotype-specific IPD incidence

132

by age and (2) to determine whether carriage data from specific age groups better correlated

133

with IPD incidence. To do this, we used a previously-described Poisson regression model

134

[19]. The outcome variable was the number of IPD cases caused by each serotype in the

135

relevant age group and time period. The covariates in this initial model were the serotype-

136

specific carriage prevalence in the corresponding time period in Jewish children <5 years of

137

age (log transformed) and the serotype-specific invasiveness for children (log-transformed).

138

A serotype-specific random intercept was included to account for unexplained serotype-

139

specific variations in IPD rates. This random intercept can be interpreted as a log(rate ratio)

140

which indicates how much more or less disease was caused by that serotype in adults

141

based on the carriage prevalence in children and invasiveness patterns in children. Analyses

142

were stratified by age or by co-morbidity status. To account for uncertainty in the predictors

143

(serotype-specific carriage and invasiveness when sparse serotype-specific data is

144

available), we fit this model within a Bayesian framework. Further details on the model

145

structure and the priors are reported in [19].

146
147

Serotype-specific invasiveness estimates for children <5 years of age, and their uncertainty,

148

were estimated using a separate Bayesian statistical model [19]. Invasiveness was

149

calculated by dividing serotype-specific IPD incidence by the serotype-specific carriage

150

prevalence in <5 year olds [20]. The hierarchical structure of this model effectively allowed

151

us to obtain an estimate of invasiveness (with uncertainty) even for serotypes with few cases

152

of disease or few carriers. The models were fit using JAGS v4.2.0 [21] in RStudio v1.0.143

153

[22], using R v3.5.1 (https://www.r-project.org/).

154
155

Because the IPD data were primarily available for the Jewish population, only carriage and

156

IPD data from Jewish residents were used in the subsequent analyses.

157
158

Stratification of carriage in children by age group to better explain adult IPD patterns

159

The goal for this analysis was to determine whether serotype-specific carriage prevalence in

160

any particular age group better explained patterns of IPD observed in adults and in different

161

risk groups. To accomplish this, the carriage data from Jewish children were further stratified

162

by age category (≤12 months, <18 months, <24 months, <36 months, 13-59 months, 18-59

163

months, 24-59 months, and 36-59 months; Table 1). The models of IPD described above

164

were re-fit using these subsets of carriage prevalence data. Deviance Information Criteria

165

(DIC) was computed for each model [23]. This Bayesian model comparison metric accounts

166

for the fit of the model to the data while penalizing more complex models. A lower DIC value

167

for a model among a group of competitors indicates that it has an improved balance between

168

model fit and complexity.

RESULTS

172
173

Characteristics of the data

174

Nasopharyngeal swabs from 10,379 individuals <5 years of age were collected between

175

November 2009 and June 2016. Of these, 48% tested positive for pneumococcal carriage.

176

Prevalence was higher in Bedouin children and among those presenting with a complaint

177

that could potentially have been caused by pneumococcus (e.g., otitis media, pneumonia)

178

(Table 1). Carriage prevalence increased through the first year of life, then stabilized,

179

declining slightly after 48 months of age in both study populations, though more sharply in

180

Jewish children (Supplementary Figure S1). More swabs were collected from younger than

181

older children (Supplementary Figure S2). The serotype distribution was broadly similar in

182

pneumococcal-positive swabs obtained from children with respiratory complaints and those

183

obtained from children without respiratory complaints (Supplementary Figure S3). There

184

were some differences in serotype distribution between Jewish and Bedouin children

185

(Supplementary Figure S4). For instance, serotype 23A was more common in Jewish

186

children in periods 2-4 and 17F more common in Bedouin children.

187
188

There were 4,303 cases of IPD among individuals >5 years of age, with 1,474 (34%) ≥65

189

years of age. Of those aged 18 years and older, 2,347 individuals had a recorded

190

comorbidity status (no risk, at risk, or high risk for pneumococcal disease [18]) based on

191

recommendations for receipt of PPV23

192
193

Variations in serotype-specific disease patterns by age and comorbidity group

194

For most serotypes, the observed IPD incidence in adults was similar to what would be

195

expected based on the carriage prevalence and invasiveness estimates from children <5

196

years of age (random intercept close to zero) (Figure 1, results for adults aged 80 years and

197

older; Supplementary Figure S5, results for all age groups). Some serotypes however,

198

caused more disease in certain age groups compared to what would be expected based on

199

carriage patterns in children (random intercepts above zero). This was notable for serotype

200

1, which was most over-represented among 5-17 year olds (with similar patterns observed

201

for serotypes 2 and 17F), and serotype 8, which was most represented among 18-39 year

202

olds (Figure 2). Both serotypes demonstrated declining gradients with older age, where the

203

number of IPD cases in older age groups was closer to the expected level. In contrast,

204

serotypes 3, 6C, 15A and 31 were over-represented as causes of IPD more among older

205

adults than among younger adults. Conversely, serotypes 21 and 27 were under-

206

represented as causes of disease in all adults >40 years of age.

207
208

Similar patterns were seen when stratifying by comorbidity status (Supplementary Figures

209

S6 and S7). For instance, serotype 3 and 8 were over-represented in adults with and without

210

comorbidities, but the effect was more dramatic in those with comorbid conditions. Likewise,

211

serotype 8 was most notable among those without comorbid conditions. We also considered

212

whether the age or comorbidity patterns were confounding each other. Even after stratifying

213

by comorbidity and by age, some serotypes, and particularly serotype 3, were still over-

214

represented among older adults (Supplementary Figure S8).

215
216

Serotype prevalence in carriage differs between younger and older children

217

We next compared the prevalence of serotypes colonizing children <24 months of age

218

versus those carried by children 24-59 months of age (Figure 3). Serotypes 5, 1, 7F, 3, 27,

219

33A, 6D, 35A, 23F, 14, 34, 18C, 22F, 12A, 24A, 37, 4, 20, 31, 19A were all at least 50%

220

more prevalent in children 24-59 months of age than in those <24months of age. In contrast,

221

serotypes 6A, 10A, 13, 19F, and 21 were at least 25% less prevalent in the children aged

222

24-35 months.

223
224

Comparing the serotypes that were more prevalent in carriage in older versus younger

225

children with the serotypes that were over-represented as causes of IPD in adults, several

226

serotypes at the extremes stand out (Figure 4). In particular, serotype 1 was carried more in

227

the older children than in the younger children and was also among the most over-

228

represented serotypes causing IPD among the 5-17 and 18-39 year old adults. Likewise,

229

serotype 3 was more common in carriage among older children and was over-represented

230

as a cause of disease among adults 40+ years of age.

231
232

While we did not have adult carriage data from Israel, previous studies from the Netherlands

233

have collected carriage data from both children [24] and adults [25]. Notably, there was a

234

correlation between the serotypes that were over-represented as causes of IPD in adults in

235

Israel and the serotypes that were more common among adult carriers compared with

236

pediatric carriers in the Netherlands (Supplementary Figure S9). In addition, serotypes that

237

were over-represented as causes of IPD in adults in Israel were also those over-represented

238

as causes of IPD in adults in the Netherlands (as compared to <5 year olds) [10], both prior

239

to and following PCV-implementation (Supplementary Figure S10). Interestingly, these

240

correlations were stronger when comparing all adults >65 years of age in the Netherlands to

241

adults aged 65-79 years in Israel than when compared to all adults aged >65 years in Israel,

242

perhaps reflecting some differences between the older age groups in these two countries.

243
244

Serotype-specific patterns of carriage in older children best correlate with IPD in

245

adults

246

We considered whether carriage prevalence in certain age groups better correlated with IPD

247

in adults, after adjusting for invasiveness. Rather than using arbitrary age groupings, we

248

calculated serotype-specific prevalence for age-bins of different widths. We then evaluated

249

which of these age groupings best correlated with the patterns of serotype-specific IPD in

250

older ages groups. DIC scores obtained from each model demonstrated that serotype

251

patterns in carriage among 36-59 month old children best explained serotype-specific IPD

252

patterns in all of the adult age groups (Table 2). Serotype patterns in 24-59 month old

253

children also correlated well with serotype-specific IPD patterns in children and young adults.

254

Patterns were consistent when stratifying by those with or without respiratory complaints.

255
256
257

DISCUSSION

258

While the serotypes colonizing children are broadly similar around the world, the serotypes

259

causing disease in children and adults vary between age groups and settings [6,26].

260

Although children <5 years of age are often considered as a single homogenous group when

261

evaluating carriage patterns, our analyses demonstrate that serotype prevalence differs by

262

age. Among the Jewish population in Israel, serotype-specific carriage patterns differ

263

between children <24 months of age and those 24-59 months of age, and the patterns in

264

older children better correlated with patterns of IPD in adults. This finding, along with recent

265

work evaluating the post-vaccine trajectories of carriage and IPD [14], suggests that

266

preschoolers might play a more important role in transmission to adults than infants and

267

toddlers. This has important implications when considering the possible public health impact

268

of different dosing schedules and the timing of booster doses. If older children are important

269

for transmission, then it is critical to ensure that they are protected adequately against

270

colonization.

271
272

Importantly, these results highlight that serotype-specific IPD patterns in adults do not

273

always reflect carriage patterns in children (considered the reservoir of pneumococcus in the

274

population). For example, the current high rates of IPD in adults that started in 2015/16

275

caused by serotypes 8 and 12F were not predicted by carriage surveillance in children in

10

276

England and Wales [11], nor in the Netherlands [27]. For any strategy aiming to prevent

277

pneumococcal disease, the presence of a large pneumococcal reservoir in older children or

278

adults is an essential factor to consider. Carriage-based surveillance should be designed to

279

address this possibility and to include older children or adults when the goal is to understand

280

or predict indirect effects of PCVs. Further work is needed to understand the implications of

281

these serotype/age patterns for vaccination strategies.

282
283

This study focused on the Jewish population in Israel, a population with relatively low

284

transmission of pneumococcus. In this population, the older children attending daycare or

285

preschool have more opportunities for transmission than those at home in isolation

286

(predominantly infants) [13,15]. The situation could differ in populations with higher intensity

287

transmission [28]. Populations with higher intensity transmission tend to have a higher

288

residual burden of vaccine targeted serotypes [28].

289
290

The intensity of transmission might also influence the age distribution of serotypes in

291

carriage, and subsequently, in disease. A population with higher intensity transmission would

292

lead to earlier first carriage episodes and more frequent exposure, as has previously been

293

observed in Bedouin versus Jewish children in Israel [29]. An earlier age distribution of

294

carriage in a high transmission setting leads to stronger immunity against the dominant

295

strains (negative frequency dependent selection [30]), potentially allowing the weaker

296

serotypes to colonize older children who are more important for transmission. Conversely, in

297

a low transmission setting, the immunity against the dominant serotypes might be lower,

298

meaning that weaker serotypes are pushed to a later age when general immunity against

299

pneumococcus is high, effectively restraining them within the population. The introduction of

300

vaccines against the dominant serotypes can shift the age distribution of sub-dominant

301

serotypes, influencing disease patterns in adults.

303

Serotypes over-represented as cause of disease in younger adults were also over-

304

represented in adults considered low risk of pneumococcal disease and vice versa, but the

305

patterns differed by serotype. For instance, serotypes 1 and 3 had opposite patterns among

306

adults. Serotype 1 was most over-represented in younger individuals and those without co-

307

morbidities, and serotype 3 was most over-represented in older age groups. Serotype 1 has

308

previously been reported to more commonly affect younger individuals, appearing to have

309

only brief periods of colonization before causing disease, while also primarily infecting

310

previously healthy individuals (in line with younger age) [31]. For this reason, it has been

311

described to act as a “primary pathogen” [31]. When stratifying <18 year olds into smaller

312

age groups, this association with young age was not due to higher rates in 5-10 year olds

313

but rather in the older portion of this group. This points to something specific to the 10-18

314

year old lifestyle, promoting high circulation, perhaps similar to what is observed for

315

meningococcal disease. With such short periods of colonization, one could expect very few

316

transmission opportunities to parents and even less (and therefore between) elderly

317

individuals (who with younger exposure may also be better protected). In line with this,

318

higher incidence of serotype 1 disease is seen in areas of intense transmission (crowding).

319
320

In conclusion, we identified age-related differences in serotype-specific disease, with certain

321

serotypes over- or under-represented in different age groups but also co-morbidity status.

322

These differences are likely explained by differences in susceptibility or exposure to specific

323

serotypes; enhanced carriage data from older children or adults and elderly would help to

324

further understand these patterns. These findings hold importance for those considering new

325

vaccination strategies for infants and for the next generation of adult-specific pneumococcal

326

vaccinations. This issue will gain urgency as current vaccine-serotypes continue to decline

327

and non-vaccine-serotypes increase as cause of disease in adults.

Supplementary Figure S8. Heatmap constructed from serotype-specific random

544

intercepts based on carriage and IPD data from Jewish children for all adult age

545

groups over 18 years of age, stratified by both age and co-morbidity status. Darker

546

blue represents serotypes in that age- and risk-strata under-represented in IPD as expected

547

based on carriage and disease data from children; darker red represents serotypes in that

548

age- and risk-strata over-represented in IPD. Certain serotypes were over-represented as

549

cause of disease in both younger and healthier individuals (#), or just younger individuals

550

regardless of risk status (&). Conversely, other serotypes remained prominent as cause of

551

disease in older age groups, regardless of risk status (*).

Supplementary Figure S9. Serotype-specific random effects for adults aged 65 years and

554

older from Israel were compared to the ratio of serotype-specific carriage prevalence in

555

adults over 50 years of age vs that in children under 5 years of age in the Netherlands, both

Supplementary Figure S10. Serotype-specific random effects for adults over 65 years of

560

age from Israel were compared to the ratio of serotype-specific disease in adults over 50

561

years of age and children under 5 years of age in the Netherlands, both (A) prior to and (B)

562

following the introduction of PCV7 into the Dutch National Immunization Program. Serotypes

563

over-represented as cause of disease in older adults from Israel were also those over-

564

represented in IPD in older adults in the Netherlands.
