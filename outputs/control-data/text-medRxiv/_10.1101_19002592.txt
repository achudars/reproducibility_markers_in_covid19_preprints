Abstract

54

Objective: To compare alternative methods of adjusting self-reported knowledge of HIV-

55

positive status and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy use based on undetectable viral load

56

(UVL) and ARV detection in blood.

57

Design: Post hoc analysis of nationally-representative household survey to compare

58

alternative biomarker-based adjustments to population HIV indicators.

59

Methods: We reclassified HIV-positive participants aged 15–64 years in the 2012 Kenya

60

AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) that were unaware of their HIV-positive status by self-report

61

as aware and on antiretroviral treatment if either ARVs were detected or viral load was

62

undetectable (<550 copies/mL) on dried blood spots. We compared self-report to

63

adjustments for ARVs measurement, UVL, or both.

64

Results: Treatment coverage among all HIV-positive respondents increased from 31.8%

65

for self-report to 42.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.4–47.8] based on ARV detection

66

70

CI 54.2–65.1) when adjusted for either ARV or UVL.

71

Conclusions: Undetectable viral load, which is routinely measured in surveys, may be a

Introduction

80

Since the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS), HIV seroprevalence surveys have often

81

included questions on knowledge of HIV status and antiretroviral (ARV) use among HIV-infected

82

respondents, as well as biomarkers such as viral load (VL) [1–3] and ARV testing. Self-reported

83

knowledge of status and antiretroviral treatment (ART) status can be subject to either positive or

84

negative social desirability bias in some respondents [4] due to the stigma associated with HIV

85

[5,6]. Some respondents may also have inaccurate recall or understanding of detailed questions

86

about their HIV testing and care histories [7].

87

Antiretroviral testing can be used to adjust self-reported HIV status by reclassifying respondents

88

with ARVs detected in their blood as being previously diagnosed and on ART [8,9]. In the 2012

89

KAIS 46.9% of HIV-infected respondents self-reported that they were aware of their HIV-positive

90

status, but ARVs were also detected in 21.0% of those not reporting prior HIV diagnosis and 19.3%

91

of those reporting no previous HIV test. However, antiretroviral testing is relatively complex,

92

expensive, and only available within a very limited number of specialized laboratories worldwide,

93

necessitating international shipping, resulting in additional cost, administrative paperwork, and

94

potential for delays.

95

Unlike ARV testing, which is added exclusively to correct self-reported HIV status and ART use,

96

viral load testing is widely available and routinely included in surveys to estimate population viral

97

suppression (defined as VL < 1000 copies/mL [10]). Undetectable viral load (UVL) is generally

98

indicative of viral suppression due to treatment, hence it could serve as an alternative, indirect

99

marker for treatment. Although the presence of elite controllers (EC) who have UVL in the

100

absence of treatment could confound use of UVL as a proxy for ART use, in US and European

101

cohorts EC are believed to represent only 0.15–1.5% of the HIV-infected population [11], while in

102

East African settings similarly low prevalence of EC has been observed [12,13], limiting the

103

potential impact of this confounding.

104

Given viral load testing is already conducted routinely in HIV surveys, we examined whether

105

adjusting estimates of knowledge of HIV-positive status and ART coverage using a measure of viral

106

load would achieve similar results to adjustments based on detection of ARVs in a national

107

household survey conducted in Kenya in 2012.

108

Methods

109

The 2012 KAIS included behavioral questions including self-reported HIV and ART status as well as

110

collection of venous blood from which DBS were prepared by field teams and plasma separated

111

and shipped for HIV testing at a national laboratory [2]. After participating in other survey

112

procedures, participants were offered rapid HIV testing by trained HIV counselors in their homes

113

with immediate return of results based on national HIV testing guidelines [14]. Participants testing

114

positive for HIV at the central laboratory were subsequently tested for viral load using the Abbott

115

M2000 platform on DBS subsequently stored at -80oC for future testing. In 2015, DBS were

116

shipped to the University of Cape Town for testing for presence of efavirenz, nevirapine, lopinavir

117

or lamivudine by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (limit of detection 0.02

118

µg/mL) [15]. These ARVs were selected to cover first- and second-line regimens in use in Kenya at

119

the time of specimen collection [8,16,17].

120

We retrospectively re-analyzed survey data to compare self-reported and biomarker-adjusted

121

versions of knowledge of status and ART use among HIV-infected respondents aged 15-64 years.

122

Measures

123

We defined UVL as having a viral load <550 copies/mL on dried blood spots, the limit of detection

124

for the assay used in the study [18]. To calculate UVL-adjusted status, we updated the status for

125

those respondents categorized as ‘unaware’ or ‘aware, not on ART’ with undetectable viral load

126

to ‘aware, on ART’. Similarly, ARV-adjusted status was calculated by updating the status for

127

respondents with ARVs detected in blood to ‘aware, on ART’. For either case, the status for

128

respondents with missing biomarker results was not updated.

129

We explored differences in self-reported, ARV-adjusted, and UVL-adjusted indicators by age, sex,

130

marital status, educational attainment and mobility. Results were analyzed in R version 3.5.0 [19]

131

using the survey package [20] to adjust and weight results to account for the complex survey

132

design. Wald confidence intervals for survey indicators were calculated on the logarithmic scale

133

and transformed to probability scale using the ‘logit’ method of the svyciprop function in R;

134

confidence intervals previously reported by Kim et al. [21] were calculated on the probability

135

scale.

136

Ethical considerations

137

The 2012 KAIS was approved by the University of California, San Francisco, the U.S. Centers for

138

Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, GA, USA and the Kenya Medical Research Institute. Prior to

139

household and individual interviews and blood collection written consent was obtained; in the

140

case of children aged less than 18 years assent was sought in addition to permission from their

141

caregiver or guardian.

142

Results

143

Among 648 HIV-infected respondents, self-reported status was ‘unaware’ among 343 (53.1%),

144

‘aware, not on ART’ among 100 (15.1%), and ‘aware, on ART’ among 205 (31.8%) (Supplemental

145

Table S1). Of those with UVL and unaware of their HIV-positive status by self-report, 40 also had

146

ARVs detected in blood (Supplemental Table S2). Antiretroviral treatment coverage among all

147

HIV-infected increased from 31.8% (95% CI 27.3–36.6) based on self-report to 42.8% (95% CI

148

37.9–47.8) when combining self-report and ARV detection, to 46.2% (95% CI 41.3–51.1) when

149

combining self-report and UVL, and finally to 48.8% (95% CI 43.9–53.8) with self-report, UVL or

150

ARVs combined (Table 1). Changes in ART coverage were consistent across demographic

151

characteristics, although the 15–24 year age group saw greater increases when adjusted

152

compared to other age groups (Supplemental Figure S1).

153

Knowledge of status increased from 46.9% (95% CI 41.4–52.4) based on self-report to 56.2% (95%

154

CI 50.7–61.6) when adjusting with ARVs, to 57.5% (95% CI 51.9–63.0) when adjusting for UVL, and

155

to 59.8% (95% CI 54.2–65.1) when adjusting for either ARV or UVL (Table 2). Similar to population

156

ART coverage, ART among those with known HIV-positive status also increased from self-report to

157

adjustment, with similar increases between adjustment methods. The youngest age group also

158

saw the biggest impact of adjustment versus self-report for these indicators in both relative and

159

absolute terms.

160

We repeated the analysis excluding the respondents for whom either the ARV or UVL biomarkers

161

were not available; findings were similar (Supplemental Table S3).

162

Discussion

163

In order to balance resources between finding undiagnosed HIV infections, linking patients to HIV

164

treatment, and ensuring retention and adherence to care it is necessary to obtain the best

165

possible estimates of knowledge of HIV-positive status and ART use. We set out to establish

166

whether viral load, a routinely-available marker in HIV surveys, can be used to adjust self-

167

reported estimates of knowledge of HIV-positive status and ART use. In KAIS 2012, UVL-adjusted

168

point estimates were similar to, but slightly greater than ARV-adjusted estimates of knowledge of

169

status and ART coverage, suggesting adjustment with UVL might have been sufficient. When

170

measuring ART coverage, all of the adjusted estimates (ARV only, UVL only, and either ARV or

171

UVL) had overlapping confidence intervals, but are notably higher than estimates based on self-

172

report alone.

173

The change in estimates when adjusting by ARVs and UVL were similar across demographic

174

groups, but 15–24 year olds did see a larger additional increase when adjusting by UVL. This may

175

indicate poor recent adherence in this group leading to non-detection of the ARV biomarker but

176

undetectable viral load (<550 copies/mL in this study). Li et al found that 37% of patients still had

177

a viral load <200 copies/mL four weeks after interrupting ART [22]. Many ARVs reach

178

undetectable levels in blood within several days of treatment interruption [8,15,23], thus in

179

populations with poor adherence or high rates of treatment interruption, adjusting based on UVL

180

may result in higher estimated ART coverage than measures incorporating ARV detection.

181

The performance of UVL for adjusting ART use will depend on the prevalence of UVL in the

182

population on HIV treatment. In populations with effective ART programs with high rates of viral

183

suppression in the treated population, it may be a relatively sensitive marker for ART use;

184

however, in populations with poor treatment outcomes a larger proportion of patients on

185

treatment would not have UVL.

186

The prevalence of elite controllers has not been established in Kenya, hence it is not possible to

187

quantify their influence on the UVL-adjusted estimates, but given the similarity between UVL-

188

adjusted and ARV-adjusted estimates, their potential impact was limited. Simultaneously

189

adjusting for either UVL or presence of ARVs may in fact be closest to true population prevalence

190

of the indicators of interest. Without better data on prevalence of elite controllers in this

191

population it is more conservative to use one or the other marker rather than both combined. In

192

settings with ample evidence of low prevalence of elite control, or where population high ART

193

coverage and immediate treatment initiation means even elite controllers are likely to be on

194

treatment, using the combined indicator would likely represent the most sensitive approach to

195

estimating population-based knowledge of status and ART coverage.

196

This analysis was subject to several limitations. While adjusting for biomarkers associated with

197

ARV exposure from a single time-point can account for misreporting of status among those on

198

ART, it cannot account for those who misreport their knowledge of HIV-positive status but are not

199

currently on treatment, or those who may be on treatment but transiently non-adherent to

200

medications. Other established methods for reducing bias in self-reported estimates, such as

201

computer-assisted self-interview methods, may also be helpful [24]. This analysis was based on

202

data from a single country with low ART coverage (43.5%) and viral suppression among those on

203

treatment (73.9%) at the time of the survey compared with current program coverage; the UVL

204

adjustment may perform differently in other populations. Simulation or replication of this

205

analysis in a diverse set of populations, including the more recent population-based HIV impact

206

assessments conducted in many countries, could help elucidate the performance of UVL

207

adjustment in different settings. Finally, poor specimen quality could result in false-negative

208

results for both biomarkers. In spite of these limitations, this analysis does strongly suggest that

209

use of UVL to adjust self-reported HIV status and ART use should be considered, especially in

210

surveys where the inclusion of the ARV biomarker may be cost-prohibitive or subject to delays.

211

Conclusion

212

Streamlining the estimation of key HIV program indicators should allow governments, donors and

213

other stakeholders to assess program performance more quickly and affordably. Viral load, which

214

is routinely measured in HIV surveys, may be a useful biomarker for adjusting self-reported

215

indicators of HIV diagnosis and treatment in cross-sectional surveys in absence of, or in addition

216

to, adjustment based on detected ARVs in blood.
