Objective: The intestinal microbiota are hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of diverticulitis.
We compared fecal microbial communities in individuals with diverticulitis to those with uncomplicated
diverticulosis.
Methods: We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to assess and compare the microbiota
composition of fecal samples from 10 patients presenting with acute diverticulitis (cases) and 10
controls with asymptomatic diverticulosis matched on age and sex.
Results: We found differences in the distribution of relative abundances of bacterial phyla and genera
in diverticulitis cases versus diverticulosis controls. At the phyla level, Verrucomicrobia was more
abundant on average in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis than in diverticulosis controls
(p=0.07). Univariate analysis identified a significant increase in the genera Coriobacteria (p=0.050),
Anaerotruncus (0.046), Subdoliganulum (p=0.034), Marvinabryantia (p=0.006), and Akkermansia
(p=0.04), and a decrease in Barnesiella (p=0.035) and Coprococcus (p=0.035) in diverticulitis cases at the
time of diagnosis compared to diverticulosis controls. However, after correction for multiple
comparisons, these differences were no longer significant. Partial least squares discriminant analysis on
all microbial genera showed partial separation of diverticulitis cases at diagnosis and diverticulosis
controls. The microbial alpha diversity was higher in diverticulitis cases at time of diagnosis vs controls
but this was not significant (Shannon diversity index 7.4±0.6 vs 6.8±0.7, p=0.08).
Conclusions: Individuals with diverticulitis differ from those with asymptomatic diverticulosis based on
components of the fecal microbiome.

Introduction
Diverticulosis is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in Western societies.(1-3)
In the US, more than $2 billion are spent annually on hospitalizations for diverticulitis.(1) This figure
does not account for the costs associated with the 3 million outpatient visits for diverticulitis each year,
or for the indirect costs associated with this disease.(1)
The etiopathogenesis of diverticulitis remains unknown. Traditional theories postulate that
diverticulitis occurs when a diverticular sac is obstructed by a fecalith or food particle resulting in
trauma, local ischemia, and bacterial stasis.(4) However, there are no data to support this theory, and
the importance of the intestinal microbiota in other intestinal disorders has inspired revised disease
concepts. Newer theories posit that alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition in patients with
diverticulosis lead to chronic mucosal inflammation and ultimately to acute diverticulitis.(5-7) Indirect
evidence supports this theory. The pathophysiology of diverticulitis involves the translocation of
bacteria across the colon mucosal barrier and standard treatment includes antibiotics.(8) Wellestablished risk factor for diverticulitis, including dietary red meat,(9) dietary fiber,(10-12) and
obesity,(13, 14) influence the gut microbiota composition and function.(15-21) Global geographical
differences in the intestinal microbial community also correspond to differences in the prevalence of
diverticular disease.(21-23) Several studies have examined the intestinal microbial composition in
patients with symptomatic asymptomatic diverticular disease (24-26) and in asymptomatic
diverticulosis.(27, 28) Only two small studies have explored the intestinal microbiota in patients with
diverticulitis.(29, 30)
Currently, we lack methods to identify individuals with diverticulosis who are at high risk of
diverticulitis. This is important because more than half of adults in developed countries have
diverticulosis, but fewer than 5% of these individuals will experience diverticulitis.(31, 32) Furthermore,

there are no proven means to prevent incident or recurrent diverticulitis short of prophylactic
colectomy.(33)
A better understanding of the intestinal microbiota composition in patients with diverticulitis as
compared to patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis could lead to the development of a riskstratification tool as well as preventive interventions. Therefore, we profiled and compared the fecal
microbiota in individuals with acute diverticulitis and individuals with asymptomatic diverticulosis using
high-resolution, next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene to assess whether
specific differences in the microbial communities could be identified.

Methods
Study Participants
The study population included 10 patients with diverticulitis and 10 controls with asymptomatic
diverticulosis from the University of Washington Medical Center, a quaternary care center, and
Harborview Medical Center, a trauma and safety net hospital in Seattle, WA. Cases of acute
diverticulitis were identified and recruited at the time of presentation, and the first stool after diagnosis
was sampled. However, all cases were treated promptly and received antibiotics prior to stool
collection (range 1 to 57 hours). All diagnoses of diverticulitis were confirmed by abdominal CT scanning.
Diverticulitis cases were excluded if emergency surgery was planned for perforation or peritonitis as
these patients usually did not have a bowel movement prior to surgery and post-surgical anatomy may
alter the microbiome. Controls with asymptomatic diverticulosis matched on age and sex to cases were
identified from colonoscopy reports and contacted regarding interest in study participation. Both cases
and controls were excluded if they had a history of bowel resection, gastrointestinal cancer,
inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, ongoing chemotherapy or immunosuppression,

or antibiotic therapy or bowel preparation in the previous 3 months (except for antibiotics given for the
index diverticulitis episode) . All participants provided written informed consent and the study was
approved by the institutional review board at the University of Washington School of Medicine.
At a one-time study visit, data were obtained regarding past medical history including
gastrointestinal illnesses and symptoms, current medication use and smoking history (in pack years of
exposure). In addition, height, weight and waist and hip circumference measurements were obtained in
clinic by trained study staff, and body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated. At the time of each stool
sample collection, participants also completed a self-administered, validated 120-item food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) developed by the Nutrition Assessment Shared Resource, Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center, Seattle, WA.(34)

Fecal Sample Collection and Processing
Two fecal samples were obtained from each participant, one at the time of diagnosis
(diverticulitis cases) or study recruitment (diverticulosis controls) and another at least 45 days later
(post-treatment for cases). This sampling schema was used to account for possible changes in the
microbiota due to acute inflammation and/or antibiotic exposure. We used methods previously tested
by our group for fecal collection, preservation and DNA extraction.(35) Briefly, participants collected
fecal samples using a home fecal collection kit. Two pea-sized samples were immediately placed in a
tube containing RNAlater, shaken vigorously to disperse the sample, and sent to the lab where they
were frozen at -80°C until further processing. Fecal bacterial DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA
stool minikit (Stool Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using primers 27f and 519r (V1-V3;)(35) for
amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP(36)) at Research and Testing (Shallowater, Texas) using Roche 454
FLX titanium instruments and reagents and following the manufacturer's guidelines. Sequences have
been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI under accession number SUB2127005.

Microbiome Analysis
To classify bacterial taxonomy, sequences were aligned and identified in MOTHUR (V.1.28.0) to
the Silva 16S rRNA gene reference alignment (www.arb-silva.de)(37, 38) Sequences were converted to
standard FASTA format from .sff files. Sequences were removed if they were <300 bp, had
homopolymers >8 bp, more than one mismatch to the forward primer, more than one mismatch to the
barcode, or ambiguous bases. Potentially chimeric sequences were removed (39),sequences were
denoised (40), and aligned to the Silva 16S rRNA gene reference alignment (www.arb-silva.de) using the
NAST algorithm. (41-43) The pre.cluster option in MOTHUR was used to minimize any overestimation
errors in microbial diversity.(44) Sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTU) using
the mean Neighbor-Joining algorithm. Sequences that did not align to the appropriate 16S rRNA gene
region were removed. Low abundance sequences were merged to the high abundant sequences using
the pre.cluster option in MOTHUR to minimize the effect of pyrosequencing errors in overestimating
microbial diversity.(32) Bacterial taxa were removed if they represented less than 0.005% of the total
sequences. (45, 46) The number of sequences in each genera was converted to the relative percentage
of the total sequence abundance per individual for multivariate analysis.

Statistical Analysis
We computed the Jensen Shannon divergence distances (JSD)(47, 48) on pairs of samples. We
then performed a global analysis of the microbiome using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS)

analysis of the JSD distances at the genera level. Unsupervised clustering using unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was performed followed by multi-response permutation
procedures (MRPP) to test for differences in community composition in the clusters.(49) A joint plot was
used to show the relationship between the bacterial genera and the ordination scores generated from
the JSD matrix. Only the vectors with a correlation of >0.5 relative to the NMS axes were shown. A
logistic regression model using the NMS axes that described the microbial community composition,
adjusted for time from antibiotic treatment (in days), dietary intake of fat, fiber, animal protein,
vegetable protein and total energy, smoking (current, past, never), and BMI was used to test whether
global differences in all of the genera in the microbiome could distinguish between participants with
diverticulitis and diverticulosis.
Differences in the relative abundance at the phyla and genera level between diverticulitis cases
and diverticulosis controls, and pre and post-diverticulitis treatment were tested using the unpaired
(Mann-Whitney) or paired non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed-rank) test. We used the BenjaminiHochberg approach to account for multiple comparisons.(50)
To investigate whether cases and controls segregated based on specific components of the fecal
microbial community, we employed partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA). PLSDA was
performed to sharpen the separation between predetermined groups of individuals, and is utilized when
the number of observations is low and the number of explanatory variable is high.(51) The input
variables were arcsine transformed relative abundances of the bacterial genera. To test the predictive
performance of the model, we used a leave one out approach. We assessed the consistency between
the predicted and actual data using the Q2 statistic and considered a value of >0.4 indicative of good
discrimination. (52) We used R2 to assess the degree of fit to the data along the PLSDA decomposition
associated with the x and y axes.(53) To estimate the influence of each bacterial genera on the first two

axes of the PLSDA model, we calculated the variable of importance (VIP). VIP values rank input variables
according to their ability to distinguish different groups. Values greater than 1 are indicative of
variables that have an important contribution to the model. (54) To examine how well this model
segregated cases and controls, we tested a 20% random selection of samples and calculated R2 and Q2
statistics.
We estimated alpha variation (within-person) in the overall microbial composition after
rarefaction using the Shannon diversity index.(55) Differences in diversity between diverticulitis cases
pre and post-diagnosis and diverticulosis controls were tested using the unpaired or paired Tukey’s ttest.
PC-ORD (version 6.0, Glenenden, OR) and XL-STAT (version 2016.04.3233, New York, NY) were

the statistical packages used for the analyses.
Results
The mean age of study participants was 55 (range 38-67) (Table 1). There were 12 males and 8
females. Most cases of diverticulitis were asymptomatic; 80% modified Hinchey class 1a and 20%
Hinchey class 1b (small, pericolic abscess). There were no statistically significant differences between
diverticulitis cases and diverticulosis controls in the mean BMI (30.2 vs. 27.7 kg/m2, P=0.39), mean daily
total energy intake (1794 vs. 1520 kcal/day, P=0.21), or the proportion of current smokers (20% vs 40%,
P=0.33). However, on average, cases consumed more fiber than controls (22.4 vs. 15.8 g/day, P=0.02).
In cases, the time between starting antibiotics for the treatment of diverticulitis and obtaining the first
fecal sample ranged from 1 hour to 57 hours (median 22.5 hours). The mean time between finishing
antibiotic treatment and obtaining the second fecal sample was 93 days (range 45 to 194). All cases
received ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for treatment of diverticulitis. In controls, the mean time

between undergoing colonoscopy and the first fecal collection was 263 days (range 99 to 721). One case
underwent colonoscopy 465 days prior to the first fecal collection. One diverticulitis case sample was
excluded from the pair comparisons due to insufficient fecal material for DNA extraction and analysis.
In total, 7.3 x 105 raw sequences were generated resulting in 14,551 ± 3782 sequences per
participant sample after quality control with an average sequence length of 463 base pairs. These
sequences represented 58 bacterial genera distributed across 7 phyla (Good’s coverage 0.996±0.003).
The predominant phyla were Firmicutes (51%) and Bacteroidetes (42%) (Figure 1). Together,
Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes represented the
remaining 7% of the phyla. We found no significant differences in the microbial communities with
respect to the relative abundance at the phyla and genera level between the two fecal samples taken in
diverticulosis controls, and therefore, the second samples were removed from the analyses. However,
the fecal microbial communities of diverticulitis cases differed at diagnosis and post-treatment. There
was an increase in the phyla Bacteroidetes in diverticulitis cases after antibiotic treatment compared to
at the time of diagnosis (Figure 1 and Table 2). The genera Coriobacteria, Erysipelotrichaceae, and
Akkermansia were significantly reduced in diverticulitis cases after treatment when compared to
diverticulitis at diagnosis (Table 3). In addition, we found a significant reduction in microbial diversity in
diverticulitis cases after treatment (Shannon diversity index 7.4±0.5 vs 6.5±0.7, P=0.03). Therefore, we
analyzed the pre and post-treatment fecal samples for diverticulitis cases separately.
At the phyla level, Verrucomicrobia tended to be more abundant on average in diverticulitis
cases at diagnosis than in diverticulosis controls (3.1 vs. 0.04, p=0.07) (Figure 1 and Table 2). We found
no significant differences at the phyla level between diverticulitis cases after treatment and
diverticulosis controls.

The relative abundances at the genera level are shown in Table 3. Significant differences in
Coriobacteria, Anaerotruncus, Barnesiella, Coprococcus, Subdoligranulum, Marvinbryantia, and
Akkermansia were seen in diverticulitis cases at diagnosis when compared to diverticulosis controls
(Table 3). However, these findings lost significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons. No
significant differences were seen in the genera of diverticulitis cases after treatment and diverticulosis
controls.
We performed a global analysis of the microbiome at the genera level using multivariate
analysis followed by unsupervised clustering. This descriptive analysis tends to cluster participants based
on the dominant members of the microbial community.(56) Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling,
after 500 iterations and a final stress value=9.35, we determined that 3 axes cumulatively explained 92%
of the variation in the fecal microbial community with 64%, 18%, and 13% of the variation in the data
attributed to axes 1, 2, and 3 , respectively (Supplemental Figure 1). We identified two clusters using an
unsupervised clustering approach that were significantly different in their microbiome composition
(multiple response permutation procedure Cluster 1 vs. Cluster 2, MRPP; T=-17.96, A=0.24, p<0.0001).
Bacteroides (r>0.5) and Ruminococcus (r>0.5) were the most abundant bacterial genera in the first
cluster, whereas Prevotella (r>0.5) was the abundant bacterial genera in the second. We included time
from antibiotics to fecal sample, diet, smoking and BMI in a logistic regression model. Only time from
antibiotic treatment remained significant in the final regression model. After adjustment for time from
antibiotic treatment, no significant association was seen between diverticulitis and the overall microbial
composition of dominant organisms, as defined via NMS axes.
In a multivariate analysis, using a supervised approach (PLSDA) including all of the bacterial
genera, we found that diverticulitis cases at diagnosis tended to separate from diverticulosis controls.
(Figure 2). When we randomly added 20% of the samples to the model, we found that we were able to

correctly classify samples 79% of the time (Q2=0.44 for Axis 1 and 0.43 for Axis 2 and R2 =0.10 for Axis 1
and 0.52 for Axis 2). Bacteria with a VIP > 1 and associated with Axis 1 included Alistipes,
Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus, and Pseudobutyrivibrio. Akkermansia, Roseburia, Escherichia,
Barnesiella, and Subdoligranulum were associated with Axis 2 (VIPs > 1). Genera shared by both Axis 1
and 2 that had VIP >1 included Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Prevotella, and Blautia. Of these,
Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Prevotella were associated with the two dominant clusters in the global
analysis (see above and Supplemental Figure 1), but as noted above, these genera were not associated
with diverticulitis. Akkermansia, Barnesiella, Coprococcus, and Subdolignulum also differed between
diverticulitis cases at diagnosis and controls in the univariate analysis (Table 3).
There was a tendency for microbial alpha diversity to be higher in diverticulitis cases at diagnosis
vs diverticulosis controls (Shannon diversity index 7.4±0.6 vs 6.8±0.7, p=0.08). The diversity in
diverticulitis cases after treatment was not significantly different from controls (Shannon diversity index
6.6±0.7 vs 6.8±0.7, P=0.4).

Discussion
In this study, we found differences in the composition of the fecal microbiota in patients with
acute diverticulitis at the time of diagnosis and those with asymptomatic diverticulosis. Differences
were seen in the relative abundances of the phyla Verrucomicrobia. Significant differences were also
seen in the genera Coriobacteria, Anaerotruncus, Barnesiella, Coprococcus, Subdoligranulum,
Marvinbryantia, and Akkermansia. The differences at the phyla and genera level lost significance when
adjusted for multiple comparisons. Nonetheless, a supervised clustering approach was able to
distinguish diverticulitis cases from diverticulosis controls 80% of the time based on the relative
abundance of the 7 genera.

A few studies have examined the intestinal microbiota in patients with symptomatic
asymptomatic diverticular disease (SUDD).(24, 26) SUDD is an incompletely understood condition
generally defined as the presence of abdominal symptoms in patients with diverticulosis and
gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence of evidence of diverticulitis. Barbara et al, compared the fecal
and mucosal microbiota in 14 controls without diverticulosis, 16 patients with asymptomatic
diverticulosis and 8 patients with SUDD.(24) The stool of patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis and
SUDD had a lower relative abundance of Clostridium cluster IV than controls without diverticulosis, and
patients with SUDD had a lower abundance of Clostridium cluster IX, Fusobacterium and
Lactobacillaceae compared to those with asymptomatic diverticulosis. Biopsies taken in the area of
diverticulosis in patients with SUDD had a lower abundance of Akkermansia than in the more proximal
colon. In patients with SUDD and asymptomatic diverticulosis, there were lower amounts of
Enterobacteriaceae at all sites. Tursi and colleagues analyzed the fecal microbiota and metabolome in
women with SUDD (n=15), asymptomatic diverticulosis (n=13) and healthy controls (n=16). The amount
of Akkermansia muciniphilia assessed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was lower in
healthy controls when compared to those with asymptomatic diverticulosis and SUDD. Patients with
SUDD had low levels of valerate, butyrate, and choline and high levels of N-acetyl derivatives.(26)
Few studies have examined the intestinal microbiota in patients with diverticulitis. Gueimonde
et al compared mucosal-associated Bifidobacterium using qualitative and quantitative PCR in 34
patients: diverticulitis (n=9), IBD (n=4), and colon cancer (n=21) and found significantly higher total
levels in diverticulitis than in the other diagnoses.(30) Daniels et al studied the microbiota in 31 patients
presenting with acute diverticulitis and 25 controls presenting to colonoscopy for a variety of diagnoses
including IBD and colon cancer.(29) Microbial material was collected using rectal swabs. PCR
amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA interspace region was performed for the phyla Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria and species were

identified using in silico comparison of fragment lengths. The diversity of Proteobacteria was higher in
patients with diverticulitis than in controls, and patients clustered separately from controls based on
Proteobacteria profiles. Kvasnovsky examined 30 patients with SUDD and compared the 15 with a prior
history of diverticulitis to those without prior diverticulitis. A history of diverticulitis was associated with
higher relative abundance of Pseudobutyrivibrio, Bifidobacterium, Christensenellaceae family and
Mollicutes RF9.(25)
Our study extends the findings of these prior studies in several important ways. First, we used
next-generation, high-throughput DNA sequencing technology to enable deep, quantitative profiling of
the fecal microbiota in diverticulitis and diverticulosis. This methodology captures a comprehensive
distribution of organisms that would be missed with fingerprinting approaches such as denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as were used in 2 of the 3 prior studies of diverticulitis. Indeed, the
differences we found between cases and controls were predominantly in less abundant organisms.
Second, we selected comparable controls with asymptomatic diverticulosis matched on age and sex in
an attempt to elucidate a microbial profile that may indicate or predispose to disease progression from
diverticulosis to diverticulitis. In comparison, prior studies used unmatched controls with colon cancer,
IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (i.e. diseases associated with specific dysbioses), who were not
known to have diverticulosis, or studied SUDD, a different entity from diverticulitis. In addition, controls
in the study of Daniels et al (29) had undergone a colon preparation immediately prior to sample
collection. Bowel preparation is known to significantly disrupt the intestinal microbiota.(57) For
example, in a study by Jalanka et al, immediately following polyethylene glycol preparation, the total
microbial load was decreased 31-fold and nearly one fourth of patients lost the participant-specificity of
their microbiota.(58) Therefore, it is likely that the differences reported by Daniels et al reflect at least in
part the colon purge given to the controls but not the diverticulitis cases. Third, we analyzed the fecal
microbiome as a representation of the entire intestinal bacterial community. In contrast, in a prior

study of diverticulitis (30) the microbiome was sampled via rectal swabs.(29) The mucosal-associated
microbiota of the rectum are known to differ from the microbiota in the large and small intestine and
represent a specific microbial niche.(59) Lastly, we collected data on important potential confounders
of the intestinal microbial composition including diet, BMI and smoking that were not accounted for in
prior studies.
There are several potential mechanisms by which the fecal microbiota may contribute to the
development of diverticulitis. A long-held theory suggests that stasis within diverticula leads to local
bacterial overgrowth and inflammation. Our results suggest that a dysbiosis in the intestine in general,
and not just within a specific diverticulum, might also predispose to or precipitate diverticulitis
potentially through pro-inflammatory effects or impaired gut barrier function.(60, 61) In a global
analysis of the microbiome, we found no association between the clusters of highly abundant bacteria
(Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Prevotella) and diverticulitis; however, we detected differences in
more minor components of the microbiome suggesting that the development of diverticulitis may be
influenced by alteration in these less-abundant groups. In particular, we found higher levels of
Akkermansia, Marvinbyrantia, Anaerotruncus, Subdolignulum, and Coriobacteria in patients with
diverticulitis compared to those with diverticulosis. Several of these genera have been associated with
inflammatory conditions of the intestine. (62-68) Succinate-producing genera such as Marvinbryantia
have been shown to promote C. difficile infection after antibiotic treatment, (69) suggesting that
alterations in the metabolic capacity of the microbiome could be important for the development of
diverticulitis. Lastly, Subdoligranulum has been associated with increased secretion of the
proinflammatory cytokine IL-β in patients with post-infectious IBS.(67) On the other hand, we found a
decrease in two genera associated with short chain fatty acid production, Coprococcus and Barnesiella,
in diverticulitis cases vs controls (although fiber intake was higher on average in cases than in controls).
Short chain fatty acid production by the microbiome is generally associated with intestinal health.

Coprococcus has been found in reduced numbers in patients with IBS (70) and IBD,(68) whereas the
expansion of Barnesiella upon dietary oligosaccharide feeding has been shown to protect against colitis
in mice (71).
Of interest, we found a higher proportion of cases were of Hispanic ethnicity than controls (40% vs
0%). This may reflect the demographic at one of the participating hospitals, the willingness of certain
ethnicities to participate, a higher prevalence of certain risk factors in this group, or an underlying
difference in the risk of diverticulitis. Several, small studies report a high proportion of Hispanic males,
especially those with obesity, among young patients with diverticulitis.(72, 73) Future studies should
explore ethnic differences in the risk of diverticulitis.
Our study has several strengths. As noted above, we selected age and gender-matched controls
with asymptomatic diverticulosis seen at colonoscopy, collected data on a variety of factors that might
confound the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and diverticulitis, including diet and other
lifestyle variables, and used next-generation sequencing techniques to enable deeper investigation of
the fecal microbial community than prior studies that generally used fingerprinting approaches. In
addition, we recruited prospective cases with CT-proven diverticulitis in an effort to capture the
microbial communities that might predispose to the development of this condition.
Diverticulitis is acute in onset, and in the U.S. it is treated promptly with antibiotics. These factors
complicate the recruitment of study participants and the collection of baseline or pre-diverticulitis fecal
samples. We identified patients presenting to the hospital with acute diverticulitis via daily searches of
radiology and emergency department logs as well as a radiology alert system. However, most patients
with diverticulitis are diagnosed in the outpatient setting making it difficult to identify and recruit cases
prior to the receipt of antibiotics. Even in the inpatient setting, an additional 6 patients were initially
recruited for the study, but became ineligible due to the use of antibiotics at the time of recruitment or

receipt of antibiotics or surgery between the collection of the first and second fecal sample. We collected
the first stool after presentation in an attempt to capture the baseline microbial communities prior to
antibiotics. However, all patients had received some antibiotics prior to stool collection (mean 1 day). This
brief antibiotic exposure may have influenced the bacterial communities in addition to the localized
inflammation associated with diverticulitis. In addition, the lower abundance of bacterial groups such as
Coriobacteria, Erysipeolotrichaceae and Akkermansia and increase in others such as Proteobacter and
Verruncomicrobia may reflect a response to antibiotics.(74) Therefore, we also collected fecal samples at
least two months following treatment. However, microbial communities may not yet have returned to
baseline. We found that the alpha-diversity was lower in post-treatment cases than in diverticulitis cases
at diagnosis although the diversity was more similar to controls post-treatment. Overall, it is unclear
whether the differences seen between cases and controls are the cause or result of diverticulitis or
treatment.
Our sample size was small, limiting our ability to differentiate cases from controls. Many of our
findings were of borderline significance or lost significance when adjusted for multiple testing. In addition,
our ability to account for and balance important confounders in cases vs controls was limited. For example,
fiber intake was significantly higher in cases than controls. It is possible that cases were instructed to
increase fiber intake. However, only 2 (20%) of cases had a prior diagnosis of diverticulitis or diverticulosis.
In comparison, all controls had a previous diagnosis of diverticulosis. Furthermore, fiber intake was very
similar at the time of diagnosis and two months later in cases. Nonetheless, it is possible that knowledge of
the relationship between fiber and diverticular disease impacted dietary recall. We adjusted for fiber
intake in our multivariable models and found no significant association between fiber and the overall
microbial composition of dominant organisms.

To overcome some of the difficulties associated with the analysis of the fecal microbiome in acute
diverticulitis, we are expanding our work to include a study of patients with a history of diverticulitis. A
prospective study of patients with diverticulosis would be the optimal means to study the role of the gut
microbiome in the development of diverticulitis; however, given that fewer than 5% of patients with
diverticulosis develop diverticulitis over an average of 11 years of follow up,(32) such a study would need
to be large and have long-term follow-up.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that the composition of the fecal microbiota in patients with
diverticulitis differs from that of matched controls with asymptomatic diverticulosis. Defining such
differences in the fecal microbiota has important potential clinical implications since they could be
modeled to enable outcome prediction and risk stratification, provide avenues for diagnosis, treatment,
and prevention, and reveal insight into disease pathogenesis.

Fig 1. The distribution of bacterial phyla in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis (black bars) and
after treatment (dark gray bars) as wells as diverticulosis controls (white bars). There was a borderline
significant difference in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia between diverticulitis cases at diagnosis and
diverticulosis controls (3.1 vs. 0.04, respectively; p=0.07)
