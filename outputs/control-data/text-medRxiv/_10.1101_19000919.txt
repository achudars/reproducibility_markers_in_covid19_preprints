Abstract
Objective
To describe trends and geographical variation in methotrexate prescribing that breaches
national safety recommendations; deaths from methotrexate poisoning; and associated
litigation.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study of English NHS primary care prescribing data, complemented
by information obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The main outcome
measures were: (1) variation in ratio of breaching / adherent prescribing, geographically and
over time, between General Practices and Clinical Commissioning Groups; (2) description of
responses to FOI requests.
Results
Out of 7349 NHS General Practices in England, 1689 practices prescribed both 2.5mg and
10mg tablets to individual patients in 2017, breaching national guidance. In April 2018, 697
practices (at the 90th centile and above) prescribed at least 14.3% of all methotrexate as
10mg tablets, breaching national guidance. The 66 practices at the 99th percentile and
above gave at least 52.4% of all prescribed methotrexate in the form of 10 mg tablets. The
prescribing of 10mg tablets has fallen over 7 years, with 10mg tablets as a proportion of all
methotrexate tablets falling from 9.1% to 3.4%. 21 deaths caused by methotrexate poisoning
have been reported from 1993-2017.
Conclusions
The prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing has reduced but it remains common,
with substantial variation between organisations. We recommend the NHS invests in better
strategies around implementation of safety recommendations. 21 deaths have been
attributed to methotrexate poisoning but with no further details easily available: the full
coroners reports for these deaths should be reviewed to identify recurring themes.

Introduction
Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist, commonly prescribed for conditions such as
rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, severe psoriasis and some cancers. Methotrexate has
a narrow therapeutic index, and higher doses can result in potentially fatal adverse events
including blood disorders, liver toxicity, and shortness of breath.​[1]​ Due to its narrow
therapeutic index, and an unusual once-weekly dosing regimen, this drug presents a
particularly high risk of accidental overdose: patients may incorrectly take methotrexate on a
daily basis; and overdose may occur due to dispensing or prescribing errors. The British
National Formulary (BNF) states that methotrexate should only usually be prescribed in a
single strength of tablet, usually 2.5mg, to reduce the risk of harm from errors.
An NHS inquiry was convened in 2000 following the death of a patient who had accidentally
taken a high dose of methotrexate daily. The inquiry made 28 recommendations to minimise
the future risk of harm ​[2]​ and the (now defunct) National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA - see
box 1) issued a national level patient safety alert in 2006 accompanied by a series of guides
and recommendations to reduce the risk of harm to patients.​[3]​ Similar incidents have
occurred across Europe and due to the persistence of such issues, the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) has launched a review of methotrexate dosing errors.​[4]
Correct prescribing of methotrexate remains a key priority for the NHS. It is one of only 16
targeted issues in the current NHS “Never Events” list (Box 1).​[5]​ In addition, NHS
Improvement have issued further guidance on Never Events to supplement the work of the
NPSA: here the correct prescribing of methotrexate is one of only 11 targeted issues.​[6]​ The
NHS Improvement document states that: “All electronic prescribing and dispensing software
programmes in primary and secondary care locations must include oral methotrexate alerts
and prompts.” Surprisingly, however, there is no mention of monitoring compliance in routine
data, or feeding back to practices and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs - see box 1) if
a breach of guidance is identified.
Our OpenPrescribing.net service is a publicly funded and openly accessible explorer for
NHS primary care prescribing data, launched in 2015, with 100,000 unique users in the past
year including doctors, pharmacists and patients. It supports complex bespoke data queries,
and displays numerous predefined standard measures for safety, cost, and effectiveness for
every practice in England. OpenPrescribing has a standard measure for methotrexate
prescribing ​[7]​ showing the proportion prescribed in potentially dangerous 10mg tablet
doses. We have noted a substantial number of practices and CCGs are commonly in breach
of best practice guidance around methotrexate.
We therefore set out to: describe the long-term trends in methotrexate prescribing over time;
describe variation between practices and CCGs in their implementation of the safety
guidance; describe and map current variation at CCG and practice level; and describe the
harm associated with methotrexate errors at a national level.

Methods
Study design
We analysed prescribing practice by conducting a retrospective cohort study in prescribing
data from all English NHS general practices and CCGs. We assessed harm associated with
methotrexate by requesting information through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to
the Office for National Statistics (ONS - see box 1) and NHS Resolution (see - box 1).
Data Sources
We extracted data from the OpenPrescribing.net database. This imports openly accessible
prescribing data from the large monthly files published by the NHS Business Services
Authority (see box 1) which contain data on cost and items prescribed for each month, for
every typical general practice and CCG in England since mid-2010.​[8]​ The monthly
prescribing datasets contain one row for each different medication and dose, in each
prescribing organisation in NHS primary care in England, describing the number of items
(i.e. prescriptions issued) and the total cost. These data are sourced from community
pharmacy claims data and therefore contain all items that were dispensed. We extracted all
available prescribing data for institutions identified as general practices, and excluded all
other organisations such as prisons. The number of patients registered at each practice was
obtained from NHS Digital data.​[9]
In addition we requested data covered by FOI ​[10]​ to the NHS Business Services Authority
for aggregated patient level data in order to ascertain where co-prescribing of both
methotrexate 2.5mg and 10mg tablets occurred for an individual patient.
We also sent access requests for data covered by FOI to ONS and NHS Resolution. Briefly
we asked for data relating to deaths from methotrexate (ONS) ​[11]​ and associated legal
claims and costs (NHS Resolution). These requests and responses can be viewed on
Figshare.[12]
Methotrexate Prescribing
We extracted data on all prescriptions dispensed between August 2010 and April 2018, the
latest data available when we started our analysis, for prescribing of methotrexate of any
form, using BNF codes starting with 0801030P (injections, ampoules and pre-filled pens)
and 1001030U0 (tablets, liquids and pre-filled pens). We excluded liquids due to the low
volume of prescribing. We calculated CCG and practice-level deciles at each month for the
proportion of total methotrexate tablets prescribed as 10mg tablets and plotted them on a
time series chart. Additionally we analysed data supplied from the NHS Business Services
Authority on prescribing of both 2.5mg and 10mg tablets to individual patients.

Geographical variation at CCG level across England
We created choropleth maps of the overall proportion of methotrexate tablets prescribed as
10mg tablets between May 2017 and April 2018 for each CCG in England.
Factors associated with prescribing of methotrexate 10mg tablets
We examined factors associated with a high proportion (>10%) of 10mg methotrexate tablet
prescribing, using a mixed effects logistic regression model. We selected variables from data
available on individual CCGs and practices from publicly available data that have previously
been shown to be associated with variation in prescribing. These variables were: Index of
Multiple Deprivation; Quality Outcomes Framework Score; a composite prescribing score
(determined by taking the mean percentile of the current OpenPrescribing measures-see
appendix);​[12]​ the primary electronic health record (EHR) system used in the practice;
whether a practice was single-handed; the urban/ruralness of the practice; proportion of
patients over 65; proportion of patients under 18; and the proportion of patients with a long
term health condition. We explored the impact of CCG as a random effect to estimate the
influence of CCG membership on individual practices within their organisation. Continuous
variables were categorised a priori into quintiles in order to allow for nonlinearity of effects
and to enhance the intelligibility of results.
The outcome used was a binary variable of whether a practice had >10% of methotrexate
prescriptions issued with 10mg tablets. We selected this threshold a priori since the majority
of practices had no 10mg methotrexate prescribing, but we did not want to include practices
that only very occasionally prescribe 10mg doses. The model was used to calculate odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each of the fixed effect variables, as well as an
R-squared value (along with the significance level) to describe the degree of variance
associated with CCG membership.
Harms associated with methotrexate errors at a national level
Responses to our FOI requests were aggregated and summarised.
Software and Reproducibility
Data management was performed using Python 3 and Google BigQuery, with analysis
carried out using Stata 14.2 and Python. Data, as well as all code for data management and
analysis, is archived online and available for free re-use, including as a Jupyter
notebook.​[13]
Patient and Public Involvement
Our website OpenPrescribing.net, is an openly accessible data explorer for all NHS England
primary care prescribing data, which receives a large volume of user feedback from
professionals, patients and the public. This feedback is used to refine and prioritise our
informatics tools and research activities. Patients were not formally involved in developing
this specific study design.

Results
Methotrexate prescribing
Methotrexate 10mg tablets represent 3.4% of all methotrexate tablet prescribing; this has
reduced from 9.1% since October 2010. Figure 1 shows the trends and variation in
prescribing of 10mg tablets as a proportion of all methotrexate tablets across England’s
practices and CCGs between 2010 and 2018. Although the general trend is downwards,
there is still very extensive variation. In April 2018 most practices prescribed no methotrexate
10mg tablets (median 0%). However 697 NHS GP practices in England (at the 90th centile
and above) prescribed at least 14.3% of all methotrexate as 10mg tablets, in breach of BNF
guidance. The 66 practices at the 99th percentile and above gave at least 52.4% of all
prescribed methotrexate in the form of 10 mg tablets.

Median is a solid line, dashed lines represent deciles, light dotted lines represent extreme
percentiles (1-9, 90-99).
We further investigated co-prescribing of methotrexate 2.5mg and 10mg tablets in individual
patients by submitting an FOI request to NHS Business Services Authority for the number of
individual patients receiving both 10mg and 2.5mg tablets in the same prescription. For
information governance reasons numbers of patients from 1-4 were suppressed at source.
1689 (23%, n=7349) practices co-prescribed both methotrexate 2.5mg and 10mg tablets to
individual patients, against current safety guidance. 197 practices prescribed mixed
strengths for more than 5 of their individual patients, affecting 1826 people.

Factors associated with prescribing of methotrexate 10mg
We modelled the practice factors associated with prescribing a high proportion (>10%) of
methotrexate 10mg tablets (Table 2). Demographic factors were associated with prescribing
methotrexate 10mg tablets: practices with a higher proportion of patients over 65 were less
likely to have high 10mg prescribing (multivariable odds ratio for highest vs lowest: 0.27,
95% CI 0.16-0.45). Practices with a higher proportion of patients under 18 were also less
likely to have high 10mg prescribing (odds ratio for highest vs lowest: 0.68, 95% CI
0.48-0.96). Urban areas were especially likely to have high 10mg tablet prescribing, but this
is likely mostly due to a focus of 10mg tablet prescribing in London and Leeds (Figure 2).
Having a higher (worse) composite OpenPrescribing score was associated with a greater
likelihood of high 10mg tablet prescribing. Prescribing practice largely did not correlate with
the principal EHR system that a practice uses, with the exception of Vision practices, which
were more likely to have high 10mg tablet prescribing (odds ratio for Vision vs EMIS: 1.68,
95% CI 1.07-2.65). The CCG to which a practice belongs (as a random effect) was
significantly associated with high-dose prescribing (p <0.0001) and accounted for 25.5% of
the variation in methotrexate 10mg tablet prescribing.

Harms associated with methotrexate errors at a national level
In their FOI response, ONS data showed 21 reported deaths from 1993-2017 classified as a
poisoning where methotrexate was the only drug mentioned on the death certificate. In total
there were 24 deaths due to poisoning where methotrexate was mentioned on death
certificates in England and Wales.​ ​The data reported by ONS and NHS Resolution was not
sufficient to explore in any detail how methotrexate was involved in the reported death.​[14]

Discussion
Summary
At least 21 people have died from methotrexate poisoning in England and Wales since 1993.
Methotrexate 10mg tablets remain common but practice is extremely variable: most
practices prescribed none; but 697 NHS GP practices in England prescribed at least 14.3%
of all methotrexate as 10mg tablets; and 66 practices gave at least 52.4%. Breaches were
more common in urban practices, and practices with a worse composite prescribing quality
score. CCG membership explained 25.5% of prescribing variation, suggesting that CCGs
exert a substantial influence on clinical practice around methotrexate.
Strengths and weaknesses
Our prescribing data includes all prescribing in all typical practices in England, thus
minimising the potential for obtaining a biased sample. We used real prescribing and
spending data which are sourced from pharmacy claims and therefore did not need to rely
on surrogate measures. This was complemented with aggregated patient level data to
identify patterns of co-prescribing, which again was sourced from pharmacy claims. Using
primary data, rather than survey data, eliminates the possibility of recall bias. We would
ideally have included hospital prescribing, and have advocated for this data to be more
widely shared: however at present it is only available for pharmaceutical industry marketing,
and a limited range of unpublished analyses at NHS Improvement.
Data on deaths related to methotrexate was obtained from the ONS, the most robust dataset
available on drug poisonings. This dataset is comprehensive but suffers from delays: figures
are for deaths registered in each calendar year, rather than occurring in each year; and a
coroner’s inquest can take months or even years to complete. The data on legal claims
obtained from NHS Resolution has limited structure and does not give any information on
the reason for the claim: deaths data may include deaths not related to primary care
prescribing, e.g. after prescriptions that were given in hospital, or adverse reactions not
caused by excessive dosing.
Findings in Context
We are aware of no prior work on the prevalence of breaches on methotrexate guidance:
however incomplete implementation of this important national NHS safety alert is consistent
with extensive prior work showing incomplete or slow adoption for other national prescribing
guidance.​[15,16]​ A 2008 survey of 376 consultant dermatologists in Britain reported 49
deaths of patients taking methotrexate. Of these: one was caused by confusion between the
2.5 and 10mg doses, and two were caused by daily rather than weekly dosing.​[17]​ However,
this survey data relies upon recall over many years. One paper in 2006 reported 137 patient
safety incidents related to methotrexate in England over the previous ten years.​[18]
However, these figures are likely to include a wide range of issues. National organisations in
France, USA and Australia have also issued advice to prescribers, similar to the NHS; and,

also similar to our findings, deaths and other errors associated with Methotrexate prescribing
continue to occur in these countries.​[19–21]
Policy Implications and Interpretation
Previous work across several countries has resulted in a variety of suggested approaches to
minimising the risks involved with methotrexate prescribing,​[19,20,22]​ and the EMA is
currently reviewing the issue.​[4]​ NHS Improvement have classed overdoses associated with
methotrexate as a Never Event; however, we can find no evidence of any action taken by
any national NHS body when anomalous prescribing is detected in a region or practice. This
is concerning, but may in part be explained by the fact that the responsibility for change is
unclear. The “never event” framework was initially managed by the NPSA; this body closed
in 2012 and became part of NHS Improvement, which does not have any remit over primary
care; this may change when NHS Improvement moves to be part of NHS England in 2019.
Locally the NHS has invested extensively in ‘medicines optimisation’ activity, in which teams
of pharmacists in every CCG monitor prescribing behaviour and advocate for change with
individual clinicians. Previous work has shown that CCG membership is associated with
prescribing patterns for practices ​[16,23,24]​ and in this study we found a significant
relationship between the CCG to which a practice belongs and the variation in prescribing of
methotrexate 10mg tablets. We are very concerned to see a number of CCGs exhibiting
minimal change-related activity, in response to an important safety alert. In our view there is
room for substantial improvement in personnel training for local staff, alongside open data
monitoring by NHS England, and appropriate action for those failing to implement change.
Practices with a higher OpenPrescribing score were also more likely to have a higher
proportion of 10mg tablets prescribed. It is unlikely that methotrexate causes poor
prescribing in other areas or poor prescribing in other areas cause prescribing of
methotrexate. We propose that both aspects of prescribing are linked by more fundamental
issues, such as individual clinicians’ skills on evidence-based medicine; or the extent to
which the practice team works together to review prescribing behaviour in their practice’s
data, identify areas where they are outliers or exhibit unusual prescribing and take action
collectively to address these issues.
Future Research
The scale of breaches for methotrexate is clear. However it is likely that many other safety
issues exhibit similarly prevalent breaches: given the low cost and high impact of data
analyses to identify individual practices and the scale of national problems, we suggest this
should be a high priority for research. While many deaths have been attributed to
methotrexate, the data from death certificates is thin. Accessing and reviewing the text of
coroners’ reports for all deaths associated with methotrexate would establish the role that
methotrexate played in these deaths, and help identify preventive strategies: while this would
take time, it seems consistent with the prioritisation of correct methotrexate dosing as a
“Never Event”.

Decision support tools and “popups” at the point of care in a clinicians’ electronic health
record software may offer an important opportunity to block unsafe prescribing. The
methotrexate safety alert from the NPSA specifically highlights that EHRs should include
“alerts and prompts”. The NHS makes significant investments in EHRs and it is imperative
that their user interfaces support healthcare professionals to prescribe safely for patients.
We found that one of EHR systems used in the NHS, Vision, was associated with higher
prescribing of 10mg tablets, and this may reflect weaker preventive measures in this system.
Our finding should be investigated immediately to understand if the design choice of the user
interface in Vision is increasing the likelihood that a patient is prescribed 10mg tablets. More
generally, we have been repeatedly blocked from researching the impact of “popups” on
prescribing as there is no national framework or data on what popups are implemented in
each setting. Additionally, this means that NHS commissioners and leaders cannot routinely
identify what popups are implemented across the NHS. In order to realise the often cited
potential of technology to improve safety the NHS ​[25,26]​ needs better oversight of
technology and the ability to ensure system providers make modifications quickly if
shortcomings are identified.
Summary
The prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing has gradually reduced, but it remains
common, and with very substantial variation between GP practices. This is unlikely to be a
unique problem. We recommend that the NHS invests in better strategies around audit and
targeted dissemination of safety information, and identifies named individuals and roles with
responsibility for implementing safety alerts.

Key Messages
What is already known about this subject?
● In the UK, it is recommended that when prescribing oral methotrexate tablets, only
2.5mg tablets should be used. This is to minimise the risk of accidental overdose,
which can be fatal. Deaths and dosing errors associated with methotrexate
prescribing continue to occur and the European Medicines Agency is currently
reviewing the issue.
What does this study add?
● Breaches of this guidance are common, and vary widely between practices: 10%
of all practices (697) give more than 14.3% of their methotrexate as 10mg tablets;
and 1% of practices (66) give more than 52.4% as 10mg tablets.
●

21 deaths caused by methotrexate poisoning have been reported in England and
Wales from 1993-2017.

How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?
● The NHS should invest in better strategies around audit, targeted dissemination,
and implementation of all safety information, not just for methotrexate. A full review
of coroners reports for deaths associated with methotrexate poisoning should be
conducted, to address any recurring themes and learning points
