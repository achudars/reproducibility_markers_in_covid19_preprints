ABSTRACT
Objective: To identify causal risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and clarify which may
instead be modified by emerging Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology.
Method: We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of a polygenic risk
score (p≤5×10-8) for Alzheimer’s disease with a wide range of phenotypes in the UK
Biobank, stratified by age tertiles. We also investigated the association between the
polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease and previously implicated risk factors. Using
two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization, we then estimated the size of causal
effects of both previously implicated risk factors and those identified by the PheWAS on the
risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
Results: Genetic liability for Alzheimer’s disease was associated with red blood cell indices
and cognitive measures in the youngest age tertile. In the middle and older age tertiles,
higher genetic liability for Alzheimer’s disease was associated with medical history (e.g.
atherosclerosis, use of cholesterol-lowering medications), physical measures (e.g. body fat
measures), blood cell indices (e.g. red blood cell distribution width), cognition (e.g. fluid
intelligence score) and lifestyle (e.g. self-reported moderate activity and daytime napping). In
follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization, we replicated established risk factors for
Alzheimer’s disease (e.g. fluid intelligence score, education) and identified several novel risk
factors (e.g. forced vital capacity, self-reported moderate physical activity and daytime
napping).
Conclusion: Genetic liability for Alzheimer’s disease is associated with over 160
phenotypes. However, findings from Mendelian randomization analyses imply that most of
these associations are likely to be caused by increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease
or selection, rather than a cause of the disease.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease is a late-onset irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, constituting the
majority of dementia cases [1], which affects 47 million people worldwide [2]. Genetic,
molecular and clinical evidence suggests that pathophysiological changes occur two to three
decades prior to the manifestation of clinical symptoms [3,4]. There are currently no diseasemodifying therapeutics or preventative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Educational
attainment is one of the few modifiable risk factors with evidence of a causal effect on
Alzheimer’s disease [5]. Several quasi-experimental studies have shown that higher
educational attainment reduces risk of Alzheimer’s disease [6–8]. Observational studies
have reported conflicting evidence for the association of cardiovascular risk factors such as
obesity, blood pressure, lipids [9–15] with incident Alzheimer’s disease across different age
groups.
However, observational associations may be biased by confounding and reverse causation
and Mendelian randomization can potentially overcome these issues. Mendelian
randomization [16] is a form of instrumental variable analysis which uses genetic variants as
proxies for environmental exposures. It can provide evidence about lifetime effects of factors
on risk of Alzheimer’s disease and is robust to many forms of bias that can affect other
observational study designs. In two-sample Mendelian randomization, the effect of genetic
instrumental variables on the exposure and on the outcome are estimated in two separate
samples. Mendelian randomization is based on three key assumptions [17]: (i) the genetic
variant is strongly associated with the exposure, (ii) there are no confounders of the genetic
variant-outcome association, and (iii) the effects of the genetic variant on the outcome are
mediated entirely by the exposure. To date, hypothesis-driven Mendelian randomization
studies have found mixed evidence for a causal role of cardiovascular risk factors in the
development of Alzheimer’s disease [8,18,19].
Linkage studies identified the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene increased the
risk of Alzheimer’s disease up to twelvefold [20,21]. More recently, large genetic consortia
have identified common genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease [22].
While non-APOE genetic variants are more weakly associated with disease (odds ratio<1.2),
they can be aggregated to generate a polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease [23].
Previous work suggested that a polygenic risk score including single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) at a p-value threshold≤0.5 had a better predictive accuracy (78.2%),
explaining 2% of the variance in Alzheimer’s disease, compared with polygenic risk scores at
lower p-value thresholds [24]. Polygenic risk scores indicate genetic liability for Alzheimer’s
disease (regardless of whether an individual will or has developed Alzheimer’s disease).

They can be used to investigate the association between genetic liability for Alzheimer’s
disease and other diseases or traits to, identify, or confirm traits that modify disease risk,
establish protopathic effects of disease and identify biomarkers that predict disease.
Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) are based on a hypothesis-free approach,
similar to the one used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and estimate the
association between a genotype or polygenic risk score and a large array of phenotypes
[25]. In contrast to hypothesis-driven analyses, the use of an agnostic approach in analyses
allows for the discovery of novel associations with no prior belief of an association, and
minimises publication bias, as all the findings are published [26,27]. Consequently, this
method may provide new evidence about the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease but to date it
has not been investigated in this manner.
In our study, we divided the UK Biobank participants (N=334,968) into three equal
subsamples and conducted phenome-wide analysis within each tertile to investigate whether
the association of genetic liability for Alzheimer’s disease with various phenotypes differed
by age (Fig 1a). To delineate whether associated phenotypes could be causing the disease
or be a consequence of the disease process, we also estimated the effect of the phenotypes
identified from the PheWAS on Alzheimer’s disease using Mendelian randomization (Fig
1b).

METHODS
Study design
Our analysis proceeded in two steps. First, we ran a PheWAS of the Alzheimer’s disease
polygenic risk score and all available phenotypes in UK Biobank, stratifying the sample by
age. Second, we followed-up all phenotypes associated with the polygenic risk score using
two-sample Mendelian randomization. We outline the different research questions answered
by the PheWAS and the Mendelian randomization approach in Fig 1.
Sample description
UK Biobank is a population-based health research resource consisting of 503,325 people,
aged between 38 years and 73 years, who were recruited between the years 2006 and 2010
from across England, Wales, and Scotland [28]. The study was designed to identify
determinants of human diseases. A full description of the study design, participants and
quality control (QC) methods have been published previously [29]. UK Biobank received
ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee (REC reference for UK Biobank is
11/NW/0382). Of the 463,010 participants with genetic data (already quality checked and
excluding participants with sex mismatch or sex aneuploidy), 54,757 were of non-white

British ancestry, 73,277 participants had a kinship coefficient denoting a third-degree
relatedness, and eight participants withdrew consent (Fig 2). In total, a sample of 334,968
remained after QC. This work was done under application number 16729 (version 2 genetic
data [500 K with HRC imputation] and phenotype dataset 21753).
Polygenic risk score
We constructed a polygenic risk score including SNPs associated with Alzheimer’s disease
at genome-wide significance (p≤5×10-8) for UK Biobank participants based on the summary
statistics from a meta-analysis of the IGAP consortium [30], ADSP [31] and PGC [32],
totalling 24,087 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, paired with
55,058 controls. Further details on the samples used can be found in the Supplementary
material. SNPs were clumped using r2>0.001 and a physical distance for clumping of 10,000
kb (Supplementary Fig 1). A polygenic risk score was calculated for each participant with
genetic data using PLINK (version 1.9). Each score was calculated from the effect size
(logarithm (log) odds)-weighted sum of associated alleles within each participant. A list of 18
SNPs used to generate the polygenic risk score is provided in Supplementary table 1. Our
main analysis is based on the polygenic risk score with the APOE region. The polygenic risk
score was standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of
the polygenic risk score.
Main analysis
The full UK Biobank sample was divided into three equal subsamples (n=111,656 in each
tertile). We performed PheWAS within each tertile. Age and sex were reported at recruitment
and confirmed by genetic data were included as covariates in the models to reduce variation
in the outcomes. We adjusted for the first 10 genetic principal components to control for
confounding due to population stratification.
Outcomes
The Biobank data showcase enables researchers to identify variables based on the field
type (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/list.cgi). At the time of data usage, there were
2,655 fields of the following types: integer, continuous, categorical (single) and categorical
(multiple). We excluded 55 fields (Supplementary table 2) a priori because: a) 3 fields
described age, b) 17 fields described the genetic data, c) 17 fields denoted assessment
centre environment variables, and d) 18 categorical (single) fields reported more than one
value per individual.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Phenome-wide association study

description of PHESANT’s automated rule-based method is published elsewhere [27] and a
brief description can be found in the Supplementary material. The polygenic risk score for
Alzheimer’s disease and phenotypes are independent (exposure) and dependent (outcome)
variables in the regression model, respectively. Outcome variables with continuous, binary,
ordered categorical, and unordered categorical data types were tested using linear, logistic,
ordered logistic, and multinomial logistic regression, respectively. Before testing, an inverse
normal rank transformation was applied to continuous variables to ensure a normal
distribution. We accounted for the multiple tests performed by generating a 5% false
discovery rate adjusted p-value threshold. After ranking the results by p-value, we identified
the largest rank position with a p-value less than Pthreshold=0.05×rank/n, where n is number of
total number of tests in the phenome scan. Pthreshold is the p-value threshold controlling the
false discovery rate at 5% [33] and was used as a heuristic to identify phenotypes to followup in the Mendelian randomization analysis and not as an indicator of significance [34,35].
Categories for the ordered categorical variables are in Supplementary table 3.
Risk factors implicated in Alzheimer’s disease in previous research
We investigated whether previously implicated risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease, that were
not detected in the PheWAS, were associated with the polygenic score. We extracted a list
of factors from the Global Burden of Disease Study for Alzheimer’s disease [36] and a
literature review of the evidence on modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia
from observational studies and randomised controlled trials [37]. We selected four factors
from the Global Burden of Disease Study (high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking,
and a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages) that contributed to metrics for deaths,
prevalence, years of life lost, years of life lived with disability, and disability-adjusted lifeyears due to Alzheimer’s disease. The review identified the following as potentially
modifiable risk factors for dementia; less education, midlife hypertension, obesity and
hearing loss, as well as later life smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation,
and diabetes. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of case-control and population-based studies
showed that rheumatoid arthritis is associated with lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease
[38]. The relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis has been
studied before using genetic-based methods such as Mendelian randomization [38], hence it
is not examined here. We examined the use of methotrexate (anti-inflammatory drug for
rheumatoid arthritis) due to observational studies [39,40] suggesting anti-inflammatory
medicines for rheumatoid arthritis reduces risk of Alzheimer’s disease [39]. At the time of the
analysis, plasma glucose was not available and was not investigated.

Sensitivity analysis
We repeated the PheWAS for the entire sample, irrespective of age. This was performed to
maximise power to detect associations. Furthermore, to examine if any detected
associations could be attributed to the variants in or near the APOE gene (Chr 19: 44,400
kb-46,500 kb) which is known to have widespread physiological effects (i.e. highly
pleiotropic), we repeated the PheWAS on the entire sample using the polygenic risk score
excluding SNPs in the APOE region.
Follow-up using Mendelian randomization
We investigated whether the phenotypes identified in our PheWAS caused or were caused
by Alzheimer’s disease using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization. Of the 177
phenotypes identified in the PheWAS and previously implicated risk factors not identified in
the PheWAS, we followed up 87 phenotypes, respectively, using two-sample bidirectional
Mendelian randomization. We did not follow up all 90 phenotypes identified in the PheWAS
because of either low prevalence, no genetic instruments, or if they indicated own diagnosis
or family history of Alzheimer’s disease. For wheeze/whistling, we also examined the
measured phenotype of forced vital capacity as a better measure of respiratory function. For
spherical power, we derived four binary variables to indicate myopia (spherical power<-0.5)
and hypertropia (spherical power>0.5) in each eye.
Data sources for the Mendelian randomization analyses
For each risk factor identified by the PheWAS and literature reviews, we performed GWAS
to identify SNPs that are strongly associated (p≤5×10-8) with each trait. Exposure GWASs
were based on summary statistics from UK Biobank, and were performed with the BOLTLMM software package [41] using a published pipeline [42], described in detail in the
Supplementary material. For body mass index, hip and waist circumference, we used
summary statistics from the GIANT consortium as it had larger sample sizes than UK
Biobank alone [43,44]. SNPs in the APOE region defined as the region between positions
44,400 kb-46,500 kb on chromosome 19 [45] were removed from instruments proxying the
exposure, due to the highly pleiotropic effects of the APOE gene. We retained independent
genome-wide significant SNPs that had an r2<0.001 with another variant within a 10 mb
window using the 1000 genomes panel [46] and removed any ambiguous palindromic SNPs.
Simulation studies [47] have shown inflation in BOLT-LMM tests statistics for unbalanced
case-control analyses. Based on the results of these simulations, authors reported BOLTLMM p-values are well-calibrated for a prevalence>10% and minor allele frequency>0.1%,
and for lower prevalence of cases, BOLT-LMM only results in inflated statistics for rare
variants. We retained phenotypes using the lowest examined prevalence in BOLT-LMM
simulation studies (0.1%). The number of cases and controls for each binary phenotype is in
Supplementary table 4.

Alzheimer’s disease GWAS
We used the same sample for the two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses as for the
construction of the polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease [32]. For these analyses, the
APOE region was retained as Alzheimer’s disease is investigated as an outcome in this
analysis.
Estimating the association between risk factors and Alzheimer’s disease
We harmonized the exposure and outcome GWAS; see the Supplementary material for
details. We employed univariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the effect of each
exposure on Alzheimer’s disease, using inverse-variance weighted regression analysis; this
estimator assumes no directional horizontal pleiotropy [16]. We used the F-statistic as a
measure of instrument strength [48]. The F-statistic is a function of R2 (amount of variance
explained by the genetic variants and the sample size). We interpreted estimates derived
from linear and ordered logistic models as a change in odds ratio for Alzheimer’s disease per
1 standard deviation in unit of exposure or category for ordered categorical variables. We
present adjusted p-values for inverse variance weighted regression accounting for the
number of results in the follow-up using the false discovery rate method.
Assessing pleiotropy
We investigated whether the SNPs had pleiotropic effects on the outcome other than
through the exposure. We compared our results obtained from inverse variance weighted
regressions, where the intercept is not constrained to zero, to those obtained with Egger
regression [49,50]. Egger regression allows for pleiotropic effects that are independent of the
effect on the exposure of interest [49,51,52]. The MR-Egger intercept estimates the average
pleiotropic effect across the genetic variants. A non-zero intercept suggests presence of
directional horizontal pleiotropy, and the estimated effect of the exposure obtained from MREgger regression allows for horizontal pleiotropy provided that the instrument strength
independent of direct effect assumption (InSIDE) holds. We also report the I2Gx statistic [53],
an analogous measure to the F-statistic in inverse variance weighted regression. The MREgger estimate is biased towards the null when the no measurement error assumption is
violated, and the stronger the violation the larger the dilution (as indicated by lower I2Gx
statistics).
Assessing causal direction
We used Steiger filtering to investigate the direction of causation between Alzheimer’s
disease and the phenotypes [54]. Steiger filtering examines whether the SNPs for each of
the phenotypes used in the two-sample Mendelian randomization explain more variance in
the phenotypes than in Alzheimer’s disease (which should be true if the hypothesised
direction from phenotype to Alzheimer’s disease is valid). We repeated Mendelian

randomization analyses removing SNPs which explained more variance in the outcome than
in the exposure.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics
The UK Biobank sample is 55% female (age range=39 to 53 years, mean=47.2 years,
standard deviation=3.8 years) in tertile 1, 55% female (age range=53 to 62 years,
mean=58.03 years, standard deviation=2.4 years) in tertile 2 and 49% female (age range=62
to 72 years, mean=65.3 years, standard deviation=2.7 years) in tertile 3. In the whole UK
Biobank sample, the Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk score was associated with a lower
age at recruitment (β: -0.006 years; 95% CI: -0.01, -0.0002; p=0.007). The mean
standardised polygenic risk score (95% CI) in each age tertile was as follows: 0.006 (0.0003, 0.01); and 0.001 (-0.01, 0.009) and -0.007 (-0.02, 0.002) (P for trend=0.01).
Main Results
Selected PheWAS hits are presented in graphs and full results are in Supplementary file 2.
PheWAS showed that the polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease was associated with
outcomes broadly categorised as dementia-associated medical history, medical history,
physical measures, parental health factors, cognitive test and brain-related measures,
biological sample measures, and lifestyle and dietary factors. Where we report results for
continuous outcomes, these are in terms of a 1 standard deviation (SD) change of inverse
rank normal transformed outcome (indicated by 'ΔSD'), where we report results for binary or
categorical outcomes these are in terms of log odds or odds (indicated by 'logOR' and ‘OR’).
Dementia-associated medical history
A higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease was associated with higher odds of
being diagnosed with unspecified Alzheimer’s disease (OR:2.39; 95% CI:1.83,3.11),
vascular dementia (OR:1.92; 95% CI:1.65,2.24), or other forms of Alzheimer’s disease
(atypical/mixed type) (OR:2.74; 95% CI:1.84,4.09), as well as higher odds of death from
Alzheimer’s disease in the oldest age tertile (aged 62 to 72 years) (OR:2.50; 95%
CI:1.86,3.35) (Supplementary Fig 2). A higher polygenic risk score was also associated
with having a maternal and paternal history of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia for participants
in all age tertiles examined, as well as a sibling history of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia for
the two older age tertiles. Furthermore, we found strong evidence of a higher polygenic risk
score being associated with higher odds of amnesia, disorientation, and symptoms involving
cognitive function and awareness for the two older age groups.

Medical history
Participants with a higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease were on average
more likely to have been diagnosed with angina (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.08) and
atherosclerotic heart disease (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.08) and to have used beta-blockers
(e.g. atenolol) (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07), as well as aspirin in all age tertiles
(Supplementary Fig 2). In the two older tertiles (ages 53 to 72 years), participants with
higher polygenic risk score were on average less likely to have had a cholecystectomy
(gallbladder removal). Additionally, a higher polygenic risk score was associated with higher
odds of having an aortocoronary bypass graft. At all ages, a higher polygenic risk score was
associated with being more likely to have self-reported a history of high cholesterol (OR:
1.16; 95% CI:1.14, 1.18), a diagnosis of pure hypercholesterolaemia (OR:1.10; 95% CI:
1.09, 1.12), and using cholesterol-lowering drugs such as ezetimibe (OR:1.20; 95% CI:1.14,
1.27) or statins (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.13). For participants of ages 62 to 72 years, those
with a higher polygenic risk score were more likely to use thrombin injections. This outcome
was not observed in the younger age tertiles examined (39 to 53 and 53 to 62 years).

Physical measures
There was evidence that a higher polygenic risk score was associated with lower basal
metabolic rate (ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.01, -0.01), body fat percentage (ΔSD: -0.02; 95% CI:
-0.02, -0.01), body mass index (ΔSD: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.03, -0.02), pulse rate (ΔSD: -0.02;
95% CI: -0.02, -0.01), waist circumference (ΔSD: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.03, -0.02), trunk fat
percentage (ΔSD: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.02, -0.02), whole body fat (β: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.03, 0.02) and fat-free mass (ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.01, -0.004), as well as whole body water
mass (ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.01, -0.004) in the two older age tertiles examined (Fig 3).
There was weak evidence of such effects for the youngest participants. A higher polygenic
risk score was associated with higher hip circumference in the younger participants (ages 39
to 53 years) (ΔSD: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.01), but lower hip circumference (ΔSD: -0.02; 95%
CI: -0.02,-0.01) for the two older age groups (ages 53 to 72 years). We also found evidence
that a higher polygenic risk score was associated with higher spherical power in the oldest
participants (i.e. strength of lens needed to correct focus). There was strong evidence that a
higher polygenic risk score was associated with a lower diastolic blood pressure (ΔSD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.02, -0.01) in the oldest age tertile.

Parental health factors
On average, the parents of participants with a higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s
disease died at a younger age (ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.02, -0.01) and had lower odds of the
mother (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.93) and father (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.96) being still

alive. Furthermore, a higher polygenic risk score was associated with lower odds of a
paternal history of chronic bronchitis/emphysema (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98), as well as
lower odds of maternal history of high blood pressure (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.98)
(Supplementary Fig 3). There was an age-dependent increase in effect size, and for some
outcomes, the 95% CIs included the null value for the younger participants.
Cognitive test measures
Participants with higher polygenic risk scores on average took longer to enter values and
complete cognitive tests in all ages examined (39 to 72 years) (Fig 4). Furthermore, a higher
polygenic risk score was associated with lower log odds of being in a higher scoring
category for number of correct matches in pairs matching round (logOR: -0.07; 95% CI: 0.10, -0.04) and being in a higher category for fluid intelligence score (logOR: -0.04; 95% CI:
-0.07, -0.02) for participants of ages 53 to 62 and 62 to 72 years. Additionally, a higher
polygenic risk score was associated with a higher weighted-mean mode of anisotropy (MO)
in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (ΔSD: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.13). There is an agedependent increase in effect size for all these factors, with the effect being weaker for the
younger participants of ages 39 to 53 years.
Biological measures
A higher polygenic risk score was associated with lower red blood cell count (ΔSD: -0.01;
95% CI: -0.02, -0.01), red blood cell distribution width (ΔSD: -0.04; 95% CI: -0.05, -0.03),
haematocrit percentage (ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.02, -0.01), haemoglobin concentration
(ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.01, -0.004), monocyte count (ΔSD: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.02, -0.01),
platelet count (ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.02, -0.01) and plateletcrit (ΔSD: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.02,
-0.01) (Fig 5). These effects increased with age, except for platelet count and plateletcrit
which showed similar estimates for all tertiles. Furthermore, although the trend was
consistent for all listed factors, for red blood cell count and haemoglobin concentration, the
95% CIs included the null for the polygenic risk score of the younger participants (ages 39 to
53 years).
Dietary measures
There was strong evidence that a higher polygenic risk score was associated with dietary
factors (Supplementary Fig 3). A higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease in the
oldest participants (ages 62 to 72 years) was associated with lower odds of eating eggs and
dairy products, and higher odds of having a greater intake of salad or raw vegetables.
Evidence of such dietary choices was weaker in the younger participants (ages 39 to 62
years). Furthermore, a higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease was also
associated with increased odds of eating more non-oily fish and having a frequent variation

in diet. There was evidence that a polygenic risk score for participants in all age tertiles was
associated with reduced odds of being in a category for always adding salt to food, lower
use of butter/spreadable butter, and higher odds of using cholesterol-lowering margarines
such as Flora pro-active or Benecol. Furthermore, we observed that a higher polygenic risk
score was associated with lower odds of being in a higher category for pork intake and
lamb/mutton in all age tertiles.
Lifestyle measures
There was strong evidence that a higher polygenic risk score was associated with a greater
frequency of walking for pleasure in the last 4 weeks (logOR: 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.04),
reporting more days per week including moderate (logOR: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.04) and
vigorous activity (logOR: 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03) and finding it easier to get up in the
morning (logOR: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.04) for participants of ages 53 to 72 years (Fig 6).
Furthermore, a higher polygenic risk score was also associated with higher odds of making
dietary changes due to illness in this age range. There was weak evidence of association for
these factors in the youngest participants examined (age 39 to 53 years). For participants in
the youngest and oldest tertiles (ages 39 to 53 and 62 to 72 years), those with a higher
polygenic risk score were less likely to experience sleeplessness/insomnia (logOR: -0.03;
95% CI: -0.04, -0.02). For the oldest participants, those with a higher polygenic risk score
reported having less sleep (logOR: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.03, -0.01) and being less likely to nap
during the day (logOR: -0.03; 95% CI: -0.04, -0.02). The evidence for these factors was
weaker for participants in the younger age ranges.
Previously implicated risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease
For previously implicated factors in Alzheimer’s disease, a higher polygenic risk score was
associated with higher systolic blood pressure in the youngest participants (ages 39-53
years) (ΔSD: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.01) but not for the older participants (ΔSD: 0.005; 95%
CI: -0.001, 0.01; ages 62-72 years). Furthermore, a higher polygenic risk score was
associated with a higher pulse pressure for participants in all age ranges (ΔSD: 0.02; 95%
CI: 0.01, 0.02). We found little evidence of an association between the polygenic risk score
and qualifications attained, social activities, anti-inflammatory treatment for rheumatoid
arthritis, and sweetened beverages. There was some evidence of an association between
the polygenic risk score and lower number of pack years of smoking for the older
participants (ΔSD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.02, -0.003) (Fig 7).
Sensitivity analysis
When we repeated the analysis using the polygenic risk score for the entire sample, we were
able to detect more phenotypes (Supplementary Figs 4-7). For example, we found that

participants with a higher polygenic risk score were more likely to develop Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, have had acute tonsillitis, and a lower age at menarche (Supplementary Fig 4).
However, as the number of cases was low for these phenotypes, the effect estimates were
imprecise. We also identified that a higher polygenic risk score was associated with
phenotypes indicating metabolic dysfunction such as diabetes and obesity (Supplementary
Fig 4). Furthermore, we found evidence that a higher polygenic risk score was associated
with a higher volume of grey matter in right and left intracalcarine and supracalcarine
cortices (Supplementary Fig 6). We observed that a higher polygenic risk score was
associated with more blood count measures biomarkers such as lower lymphocyte and white
blood cell count. A higher polygenic risk score was also associated with higher corpuscular
haemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte percentage, and platelet distribution width
(Supplementary Fig 6). We found that a higher polygenic risk score was associated with
lower frequency of depressed days during worst episode of depression (among those who
reported prolonged feelings of sadness or depression or ever having had a prolonged loss of
interest in normal activities), as well as lower odds of smoking tobacco on most days.
However, individuals were asked the frequency of depressed days only if they reported “yes”
to questions of ever having had prolonged feelings of sadness or depression (field 20446) or
of ever having prolonged loss of interest in normal activities (field 20441). We found little
evidence that the polygenic risk score was associated with reporting “yes” to these two
questions, suggesting collider bias is unlikely (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99,1.02) and OR:1.00,
95% CI:0.99, 1.01) (Supplementary Fig 7).
When we repeated the analysis removing SNPs tagging the APOE region from the polygenic
risk score using the whole sample, the variance explained in the phenotypes was lower and
we could not replicate most of the hits detected in tertile 3. There was still evidence that the
non-APOE polygenic risk score was associated with lower number of correct matches in
pairs matching rounds (Supplementary Fig 10). Other associations we found using the
APOE-inclusive polygenic risk score which replicated in the non-APOE polygenic risk score
were higher odds of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and having a family history
of Alzheimer’s disease (Supplementary Fig 8), as well as lower odds of a paternal and
maternal chronic bronchitis/emphysema and of parents being still alive (Supplementary Fig
9).
Two-sample Mendelian Randomization of UK Biobank phenotypes on Alzheimer’s
disease
We found little evidence that a higher genetic liability for own medical and family history of
factors related to ill health (e.g. use of medications, diagnoses of conditions such
atherosclerosis), as well as blood-based measures had a causal effect on Alzheimer’s

disease (Table 1, Supplementary tables 10-11,14,15). Using 51 genetic instruments (F
statistic=55.31), we found strong evidence that a higher genetically predicted hip
circumference decreased the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (OR: 0.75; 95% CI:0.61,0.90). We
also identified weak evidence that genetically predicted body fat percentage, whole body fat
mass, trunk fat percentage, as well as whole-body fat free mass lowered risk of Alzheimer’s
disease. For example, a one SD increase in genetically predicted whole body fat mass
resulted in a 11% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (OR:0.89; 95% CI:0.76,0.99; no.
SNPs=410) (Table 1, Supplementary table 12). Using 649 SNPs (F statistic=41.56), we
also found weak evidence suggesting a one SD increase in genetically predicted whole body
fat-free mass caused 16% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (Table 1, Supplementary table
12). Furthermore, using 251 SNPs we found that a higher genetically predicted forced vital
capacity was causally associated with 22% lower odds for Alzheimer’s disease
(OR:0.78;95% CI:0.67,0.90) (Table 1, Supplementary table 12). With 76 SNPs (F
statistic=39.93), we found that a one standard deviation increase in genetically predicted
fluid intelligence score reduced the odds of Alzheimer’s disease by 27% (OR:0.73; 95%
CI:0.59,0.90) (Table 1, Supplementary table 13). Using 15 SNPs (F statistic=35.79), we
observed that a higher genetic liability of doing more moderate physical activity (at least 10
minutes), but not self-reported vigorous activity, was causally associated with higher odds of
developing Alzheimer’s disease (OR: 2.29; 95% CI:1.32, 3.98 and OR: 1.02; 95% CI:
0.33,3.18, respectively) (Table 1, Supplementary table 16). We also found a higher genetic
liability (no. SNPs=89; F statistic=45.32) for napping during the day reduced the odds of
developing Alzheimer’s disease by 26% (OR: 0.74, 95% CI:0.59,0.93). For previously
implicated risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease, we found a higher genetic liability for having a
college degree and A level qualifications reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore,
using 1 SNP, we found that a genetic liability for having a high hearing ability (speech
reception threshold) was associated with lower odds of Alzheimer’s disease (OR:0.23, 95%
CI: 0.06,0.91), but the effect estimate is extremely imprecise (Table 1, Supplementary
table 17).
Assessing pleiotropy
Due to the large sample size of UK Biobank (in addition to other samples for some
exposures), the instrument strength of all genetic variants was relatively high (F>30.10).
However, the set of SNPs used for each of the body measures were highly heterogeneous
(all heterogeneity Q statistic P<3.37x10-5), indicating that several of the SNPs may be
horizontally pleiotropic. The causal effects were not consistent across SNPs, with some
SNPs showing large effects on the outcome given the magnitude of association with the
exposure (Supplementary Figs 12-16). We found evidence of heterogeneity in the causal

effect estimates for forced vital capacity (Q statistic=404.47, p=4.0x10-6) (Supplementary
table 12 and fig 17) and fluid intelligence score (Q statistic=133.88, p=3.46x10-5)
(Supplementary table 13 and Fig 18). For napping during the day, we found little evidence
that the instruments exhibited horizontal pleiotropy (Q statistic=89.47, p=0.44)
(Supplementary table 16, Fig 19). Although the SNPs instrumenting both the exposures of
having A level qualifications and a college degree display heterogeneity, the horizontally
pleiotropic effects appear to be independent of the effects of the SNPs on the exposure (i.e.
balanced horizontal pleiotropy) (Supplementary table 17, Fig 21-22).
Assessing causal direction
Using Steiger filtering, we did not find evidence that the instruments explained more variance
in the outcome compared to the exposure for most exposures, corroborating the
hypothesised causal direction from exposure to Alzheimer’s disease for results reported in
the two-sample Mendelian randomization section. However, the effect estimates for
Mendelian randomization analyses retaining only the SNPs with the true hypothesised
causal direction using Steiger filtering attenuated for body fat percentage, whole body fat
mass, whole body fat-free mass (Supplementary file 2).
Discussion
We examined the effect of a higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease on a
broad range of phenotypes from the UK Biobank. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
conduct a hypothesis-free phenome scan to investigate the far-reaching causal effects of a
polygenic risk score of Alzheimer’s disease on many traits, and to examine these effects by
age group in such a large sample. We found that a higher APOE-inclusive polygenic risk
score for Alzheimer’s disease was associated with medical history of conditions such as high
cholesterol and atherosclerosis, family history of conditions such as diabetes and heart
attack, physical measures, biological sample measures, lifestyle and dietary factors. The
effects of a higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease are stronger in participants
of ages 62 to 72 years although the direction of effect is largely similar across age groups.
To establish directional causality, we employed two-sample Mendelian randomization to
assess whether the effects observed are causes or consequences of the disease process.
We found that a genetic liability for higher hip circumference, whole body fat and fat-free
mass, trunk and body fat percentage, fluid intelligence, hearing ability, napping during the
day, and forced vital capacity lowered the odds of Alzheimer’s disease, while higher selfreported moderate physical activity increased the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

The PheWAS using all Alzheimer’s disease SNPs (including those in the APOE gene)
suggested that the genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease had an effect on a diverse array of
phenotypes such as medical history (e.g. high cholesterol and cholesterol-lowering
medication), brain-related phenotypes (e.g. higher volume of grey matter in supracalcarine,
intracalcarine and cuneal cortices), physical measures (e.g. lower body fat measures),
lifestyle (e.g. self-reported daytime napping), and blood measures (e.g. lower red blood cell
distribution width). However, these effects appear to be largely driven by the APOE gene, as
our sensitivity analysis excluding the APOE region replicated only effects for family history of
Alzheimer’s disease and some cognitive measures. Studies in APOE-deficient mice
demonstrate the multifunctional role of APOE on longevity-related phenotypes such as
changes in lipoprotein profiles [55–57], neurological disorders [58], type II diabetes [59],
altered immune response [60], and increased markers of oxidative stress [61]. Similarly,
observational studies show that APOE is related to lower levels of high density-lipoprotein,
higher levels of high-density lipoprotein [62–64], changes in body mass index [64–67], as

well as a higher risk for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction [68]. Therefore,
due to the horizontally pleiotropic nature of the APOE gene, we cannot delineate whether the
effects of the polygenic risk score on traits observed in the PheWAS (e.g. atherosclerotic
heart disease) are part of biological pathways related to Alzheimer’s disease.
Previous observational studies have found conflicting evidence for the association of
cardiovascular risk factors with Alzheimer’s disease depending on the age at which these
risk factors were measured. For example, obesity as measured in midlife has been
associated with higher risk of dementia [69–71], whereas older age obesity has been
associated with a lower risk for Alzheimer’s disease [71–73]. Recently, a large-scale
population study in the UK clinical practice research datalink, found that low body mass
index in all age groups was associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease [74].
Similarly, in our study, a higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease was associated
with lower body mass index, whole body fat mass, whole body fat-free mass, body fat
percentage, whole body water mass and trunk fat percentage in participants of ages 52-72
years. The effect of polygenic risk score on these traits was much smaller and consistent
with the null for the younger participants. A similar trend in observational studies is also
observed for hypertension, where some studies have shown that a higher midlife systolic
and diastolic blood pressure elevate the risk of developing dementia [75]. In concordance
with some late-life studies which found lower diastolic blood pressure to be associated with
higher odds of Alzheimer’s disease [12,76,77], we identified evidence that a higher polygenic
risk score for Alzheimer’s disease is associated with lower diastolic blood pressure in the
62-72 years age stratum. Mendelian randomization studies found that a higher systolic
[19,78] and diastolic pressure [78] cause lower odds of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as
higher odds of vascular brain injury [78]. A different Mendelian randomization study [79],
examined the effect of lowering systolic blood pressure on Alzheimer’s disease, employing
instruments for different anti-hypertensive medications. They report little evidence that lower
systolic blood pressure influences the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and any effects of the
antihypertensive drugs examined are unlikely to affect risk of Alzheimer’s disease solely by
lowering systolic blood pressure.
In agreement with some previous Mendelian randomization studies [8,18,79,80], we found
little evidence that body mass index and blood pressure influence the risk of developing
Alzheimer’s disease. Hence, the association observed in the PheWAS between the
polygenic risk score, lower body fat measures and diastolic blood pressure may be an effect
of the disease process. We found that a higher self-reported number of days of moderate
physical activity increased the odds of Alzheimer’s disease. A Mendelian randomization

study [81] also found evidence that a higher moderate vigorous physical activity was
associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease, yet found physical activity increased
cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels (indicative of higher cerebral amyloid load [82–84]).Genetic
variants associated with lower cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels have been shown to be
associated with earlier disease, higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease, as well as faster
progression.
Immune and inflammatory processes are speculated to be involved in Alzheimer’s according
to recent research on cellular, genetic, and molecular mechanisms of disease development.
A recent study [85] identified P.gingivalis, the bacterium causing chronic periodontitis in
brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Although we identified little evidence that genetic risk for
Alzheimer’s disease was associated with dental infections, we found it to be associated with
several phenotypes involving inflammatory pathways such as self-reported
wheeze/whistling, monocyte count, and blood-based measures.
We used forced vital capacity as a measured phenotype proximal to self-reported recurrent
phenotypes associated with respiratory function (e.g. wheeze/whistling) and the estimates
suggested a protective role for Alzheimer’s disease. This is in agreement with previous
evidence of modest correlations between the Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk score and
asthma and the polygenic risk score of asthma with Alzheimer’s disease [86]. The Finnish
Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia study, which followed 2000 participants
for 20 years, from midlife to late life, found an association between asthma in midlife and a
higher risk of dementia, which attenuated after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors
[87]. In another study, there was still evidence of an association, even after adjustment for
medical comorbidities and use of inhaled steroids [88]. Forced vital capacity may be linked to
Alzheimer’s disease through various mechanisms. Poor lung function may increase the risk
of Alzheimer’s disease through chronic hypoxia resulting in the increase of Aβ production
and reduction in the degradation of this protein [89] and the development of ischemic
damage to the brain. For example, individuals with poor respiratory function are more likely
to develop white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts [90]. Another potential mechanism could
be through inducing a pro-inflammatory state, as individuals with low lung function have
higher levels of C-reactive protein [91] which has been shown to increase the risk of
dementia [92].
A study in UK Biobank [93] found that genetic variants associated with red blood cell
distribution width are linked to autoimmune disease (e.g. type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid
arthritis), as well as traits related to ageing (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, macular degeneration

and longevity). In agreement with our findings, they found that the polygenic risk score for
Alzheimer’s disease was associated with lower red blood cell distribution width, an effect
which attenuated after exclusion of the APOE locus [93]. Indicators of relatively poor red
blood cell function, as well as anaemia were associated with lower cognitive function and
Alzheimer’s disease in individuals from AddNeuroMed and UK Biobank [94]. In our study,
red blood cell indices show the earliest evidence of association with the genetic risk of
Alzheimer’s disease, but we found little evidence that these measures caused Alzheimer’s
disease using Mendelian randomization indicating that cell composition changes may be an
early consequence of Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology or downstream of related
behavioural changes.
We found evidence that a polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease was associated with a
lower fluid intelligence score, as previously reported [95] but not educational attainment.
Although previous Mendelian randomization studies have suggested that higher educational
attainment causes lower odds for Alzheimer’s disease [7,8,96], a recent multivariable
Mendelian randomization study found little evidence that educational attainment directly
increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease over and above the underlying effects of intelligence
[6]. Another Mendelian randomization study which studied the relationship between traits
previously linked to Alzheimer’s disease in observational studies found that higher education
delayed age of onset of Alzheimer’s disease [78]. However, they found little evidence that
education is causally linked to Alzheimer’s neuropathology and cerebrospinal fluid
biomarkers, suggesting that the effects are due to a larger cognitive reserve rather than
through pathological changes related to Alzheimer’s disease [78].
We identified suggestive evidence of a bidirectional relationship between sleep and
Alzheimer’s disease. Self-reported daytime napping causally reduced risk of Alzheimer’s
disease and a higher genetic risk for Alzheimer’s resulted in changed sleeping patterns (e.g.
less napping during the day, lower sleep duration). To date, there is accumulating evidence
implicating sleep in Alzheimer’s disease, but the directionality of this relationship is unclear
[97]. Observational studies have shown that increased sleep fragmentation is associated
with cognitive impairment and dementia [98–100]. However, their follow-up periods were too
short to ensure that pathophysiological changes related to Alzheimer’s had not already
started [3]. Mouse models suggest this relationship may be bidirectional as accumulation of
Aβ protein may cause sleep disturbances and disrupted sleep may increases the risk of Aβ
accumulation [101–103].

The large sample of UK Biobank provided unparalleled statistical power to investigate the
phenotypic manifestation of a higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease, by age
group, and to follow-up these hits using Mendelian randomization. Furthermore, the
systematic approach of searching for effects using PheWAS reduces bias associated with
hypothesis-driven investigations and reduces publication bias as all findings are published
and not only the most “significant” [35]. However, a consideration for the use of PHESANT is
that it uses a rule-based method to test the association of the exposure with each outcome
and it is likely the transformation applied may have been inefficient for some phenotypes
(e.g. rare binary traits/diseases) and may have reduced power. Furthermore, although
polygenic risk scores were derived using variants associated at genome-wide significance
level, they can still have horizontal pleiotropic effects on different disorders and traits.
For Mendelian randomization analyses, we used non-overlapping samples (UK Biobank and
meta-analysis (IGAP, ADSP, and PGC ALZ)), minimising bias in the causal estimates [104].
However, instruments for Mendelian randomization were largely based on GWAS from selfreported measures which may have introduced reporter bias. For example, self-reported
physical activity is a complex measure which is likely to capture social and psychological
factors, and hence further research should use instruments proxying the metabolic
equivalent of task or accelerometer data available in UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization
estimates generally reflect the lifetime effects of a phenotype, rather than the effect of
phenotype at a specific age or time [105]. Thus, it is challenging to identify when putative risk
factors affect risk of Alzheimer’s disease (e.g. red blood cell distribution width).

Our results could be explained by collider bias, which may have been introduced into our
study through selection of the study sample. Collider bias can occur by either a) restricting a
sample or b) adjusting a statistical model for a common effect of two variables of interest.
The UK Biobank includes a highly selected, healthier sample of the UK population [106].
Compared to the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, to
drink alcohol on a daily basis, and had fewer self-reported medical conditions [107].
Selection bias may occur if both having a lower genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s
disease and a specific trait (e.g. higher education, lower BMI) affect participation in the
study. This could induce an association between genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and the
traits in our study [108].
A further source of collider bias is survival bias, a limitation of studies estimating the causal
effects of exposures and outcomes associated with mortality [109,110]. If both the polygenic
risk score for Alzheimer’s disease and the examined traits associate with survival, sampling

population. Such bias may have affected our findings for body mass, as heavier individuals
and those with higher values of the Alzheimer’s polygenic risk score are less likely to survive
and participate in UK Biobank. The polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease in our analysis
was associated with lower age at recruitment, suggesting that older people with high values
of the score are less likely to participate. Thus, we cannot be certain whether the
associations of the polygenic risk score with phenotypes such as body mass index are due
to a causal effect or some form of selection bias.
Conclusion
In this phenome-wide association study, we identified that a higher genetic predisposition for
Alzheimer’s disease is associated with 165 phenotypes of 15,403 UK Biobank phenotypes,
highlighting established and novel associations. Mendelian randomisation analysis follow-up
of phenotypes identified in our PheWAS hits and in previous observational studies, showed
evidence that only 10 of these factors were implicated in the aetiology of Alzheimer’s
disease. We found little evidence that the remaining 155 phenotypes were driving the
disease process, but rather our results indicate reverse causation or selection bias. Further
research should exploit the full array of potential relationships between the genetic variants
implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, intermediate phenotypes, and clinical phenotypes by
using genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phenotypic data to identify potential biological
pathways and to strengthen and widen evidence for causal risk factors of Alzheimer’s
disease.

Fig 1. Diagram (A) describes our study design when conducting a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) and diagram (B) describes our
study design when using Mendelian randomization. In (A), the polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease may either have a downstream
causal effect on the trait (e.g. body mass index), or it may affect the trait through pathways other than through Alzheimer’s disease (i.e.
pleiotropic effects). Diagram (B) describes our follow-up analysis using Mendelian randomization to establish causality and directionality of the
observed associations. In (2), we test the hypothesis that the trait (e.g. body mass index) is causally associated with Alzheimer’s disease,
provided that the conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) are adequately satisfied, governing that the polygenic risk score for the trait of interest is a valid
instrument, in that (i) the polygenic risk score for a trait is robustly associated with the trait it proxies, (ii) it is not associated with measured or
unmeasured confounders of the trait, and (iii) its association with the outcome is conditional on the trait.

logistic regression models and are on the log odds scale. There is little evidence of an association for the polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s
disease and previously implicated risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease, except for pulse pressure, pack years of smoking, use of a hearing aid,
and going to the pub or social club. Most of these associations appear in the older age group, suggesting these previously implicated factors for
Alzheimer’s disease may be attributed to the disease process or frailty.
