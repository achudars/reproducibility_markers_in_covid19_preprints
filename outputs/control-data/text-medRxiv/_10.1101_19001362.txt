Abstract

32

Background. Although considered important, the involvement of young children in research is rare

33

and its impact has never been measured. We aim to provide a good practice example of involvement

34

of young children in the development of a tablet-based 3D eye test or stereotest, ASTEROID. We

35

focus on improving understanding of test instructions.

36

Methods. After a pre-measure of understanding was taken, we explored issues with the test

37

instructions in patient and public involvement (PPI) sessions. Feedback was collected via

38

observations, rating scales and children’s comments. An interdisciplinary panel reviewed the

39

feedback and decided on the implementation. Subsequently, a post-measure was collected. In Study

40

1, 650 children (2-11.8 years old) took part in the pre-measure, 111 children (1-12 years old) in the

41

PPI sessions, and 52 children (4-6 years old) in the post-measure which also served as a pre-measure

42

for Study 2. PPI sessions for Study 2 attracted 122 children (1-12 years old) and adults. 53 people (2-

43

39 years old) participated in the post-measure of Study 2.

44

Results. Following feedback in Study 1, we added a frame cue and included a shuffle animation. This

45

increased the percentage of correct practice trials from 76% to 97% (t(231)=14.29, p<.001). After

46

adding a cardboard demo in Study 2, the percentage of correct trials remained stable but the

47

number of additional instructions given decreased (t(103)=3.72, p<.001).

48

Conclusions. Our study demonstrates impact of involvement of very young children in research

49

through accessible activities. It can encourage researchers to involve young children and contribute

50

to developing guidelines.

Introduction

53

The UK National Advisory Group promoting public involvement in health and social care research,

54

INVOLVE, defines Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) as research which is …”carried out ‘with’ or

55

‘by’ members of the public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them 1. This does not include people in

56

their role as research subjects or participants in a study, but rather as advisers or collaborators in the

57

research 2. PPI continues to be of growing importance for research across disciplines. Involvement of

58

children in research is encouraged in the guiding principles of the United Nation’s convention on the

59

Right of the Child. Article 12 acknowledges that children and young people have the right to be

60

involved in decisions that affect their life, express their views and have their views listened to 3.

61

Involving children in research from design to dissemination is therefore no longer a preferred

62

approach but a requirement 4.

63

Traditionally, children’s perspectives have been filtered through interpretations of parents and

64

carers rather than children being involved themselves with their unique insights into their own

65

reality 5. Despite the change in policy and vision, examples of involvement of children in research are

66

very limited, especially across the range of healthcare provision 4,6,7.

67

For instance, on 28th April 2019, the INVOLVE evidence library 8 included 321 works of involvement

68

of people in designing research in the health sector, 19 of which relate to children’s research and

69

PPI. Of these 19, only seven describe original research that involves children, and none outline

70

involvement of children under 6 years old. Dunn and colleagues 4 concluded that despite many

71

“efforts to include children’s voices, translation into research and pedagogical practice is still

72

evolving“.

73

Whilst securing involvement from adults may be more straightforward, involving children in research

74

is challenging. There is the intrinsic issue of generational divide and power differences between

75

researchers and children they endeavour to work with 4. Specifically, younger children are arguably

76

at more risk of difficulty with understanding questions that ask for their feedback. The difficulty of

77

choosing age-appropriate involvement methods for young children has been seen as a barrier to

78

involvement 4 and good practice methodology on how PPI with children should be achieved is

79

lacking 2. Some guidelines are available 5,9 but they only advise on running discussion groups with

80

young people, generally above 12 years old. In sum, while toolkits and case studies from national

81

bodies provide starting points from which research groups could promote PPI practice, a large

82

evidence base containing research that implements this does not yet exist.

83

Furthermore, no evidence is available on the impact of PPI with young children upon research to

84

drive the development of standards of good practice 6. Taken together, there is an urgent need for

85

evidence on how young children can be involved in research and what impact can be achieved.

crucially, this paper aims to contribute to the slowly growing pool of research that involves children

91

and young people and provide evidence of its impact on research. Such an evidence base is the all-

address this, a new test, known as “Accurate STEReotest On a mobile Device” or ASTEROID, was

102

developed on a glasses-free 3D tablet (see Figure 1 and Study 1 Methods for a detailed description,

something that has proven to be an issue with younger children with the currently available

105

stereotests 15. To engage children and young people, ASTEROID took the form of an animated game.

106

ASTEROID was validated against a gold standard stereotest and normative data were collected.

107

Anecdotal evidence and feedback gathered during data collection highlighted some issues. Key to

108

this is ensuring that each participant understood what “seeing the 3D image” would be like to

109

ensure that any failures were genuinely due to problems with stereo vision rather than

110

understanding test instructions. These initial outcomes triggered an iterative PPI approach.

111
112

Design of the studies

113

a data collection stage in which children completed ASTEROID in the context of our larger validation

114

study and we observed an issue related to poor understanding of ASTEROID (pre-measure). In the

115

second stage, this issue was then explored in depth during patient and public involvement (PPI) with

116

a different group of children or adults. By collecting feedback from participants with no previous

117

experience of ASTEROID, we were able to avoid learning effects. PPI outcome triggered changes to

118

ASTEROID (Stage 3). Subsequently, the new version of ASTEROID was evaluated in a separate sample

119

(post-measure, Stage 4). This enabled us to collect quantitative evidence of the impact of our PPI.

120

Verbal feedback and observations during Stage 4 highlighted other issues and subsequently

121

triggered another cycle. In this paper we describe two such cycles that aimed to improve

122

understanding of ASTEROID (Study 1 and 2). Our secondary aim was to monitor how engagement

123

levels changed following improvement of ASTEROID (Study 3).

An iterative approach was undertaken to improve ASTEROID (see Figure 1). Each Study started with

Study 1: Practice trials and trial-to-trial transition

129

Stage 1: Pre-measure

130

Participants. 650 children between 2.1 and 11.8 years old (median age = 6.2, IOR = 3.1, 318 boys and

131

332 girls) participated in Stage 1. They completed the ASTEROID stereotest in the context of a larger

132

validation study with other vision tests. All parents received an information leaflet about the study

133

and an opt-out consent form. If requested by the school or nursery an opt-in consent procedure was

134

used. Children were always asked for oral or non-verbal assent at the time of testing. The study

135

protocol was compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee

136

of the Newcastle University Faculty of Medical Sciences (approval number 01078). Data were

137

collected in local schools and nurseries.

138

Instruments. ASTEROID (version 0.932 and 0.933) is a stereotest that runs on a 3D tablet computer

139

with an autostereoscopic display, meaning no 3D glasses were required for use. The stereotest is

140

embedded in an enjoyable game designed to keep children engaged and responsive. A Bayesian

141

staircase was implemented to adjust the difficulty level of each trial, depending on the user’s ability.

142

The test takes the form of four dynamic random-dot stereograms (Figure 2). A disparate target

143

appears randomly in one of these stereograms. The child is verbally instructed to look at each of the

144

four “squares” individually to see which one sticks out. The viewing distance is monitored by the

145

front camera. To ensure that the child understands the task, ASTEROID starts with non-stereo

146

practice trials. In these trials, a colour is added on top of the stereo cue, to make the target clearly

147

visible. This cue is also visible even to colourblind individuals, due to the change in luminance. If the

148

child solves the practice trials correctly, the colour cue gradually fades away over the next few trials

149

and will eventually disappear, leaving only the stereo cue. There are a minimum of 25 stereo trials –

150

the number of non-stereo practice trials increases with the number of mistakes made in the practice

151

trials. Technical details of ASTEROID are described elsewhere 14.

152

154

stereograms. One of the four stereograms has a square with a different disparity and appears to float above

155

the display. In the practice trials this square also has different coloured dots. The colour cue is removed in the

156

disparity-only trials.

157

Outcome measures. Our primary outcome measures were (1) the proportion of children who solved

158

less than 80% of the practice trials, (2) the proportion of practice trials that were solved correctly by

159

each child, and (3) the number of additional verbal instructions needed for each child. Performance

160

in the practice trials gives us a good indication of the understanding of the task because even

161

children with vision problems like stereoblindness or colourblindness should be able to solve the

162

practice trials correctly. Secondary, observations of children playing ASTEROID were valuable in

163

generating hypotheses for poor understanding of the task that were further explored in Stage 2.

164

Results. 39% of the children showed a poor understanding of the ASTEROID task by solving less than

165

80% of the practice trials correctly. The average proportion of correct practice trials was 0.76 and on

166

average 10 additional prompts were needed per child to explain the task. We particularly observed

167

difficulties in the transition between the practice trials and the stereo trials.

168

Stage 2: PPI sessions

169

People involved. 111 children between 2 and 12 years old (median age = 4, IQR = 3, 53 girls, 55 boys,

170

3 gender not recorded) were involved in the PPI sessions. They attended local science and history

171

museums in Newcastle-upon-Tyne (United Kingdom) between October 2016 and January 2017 and

172

were invited to join a PPI session for 5-10 minutes. No ethical approval was required for PPI 16.

173

Children were thanked for their feedback with a ‘Junior Scientist’ certificate and a sticker.

174

Level and nature of involvement. We organised three informal drop-in PPI sessions (Table 1). We set-

175

up a stall with engagement activities around vision testing and neuroscience in an area of the

176

museum with high traffic (Figure 3). The stall contained games including visual distortion goggles,

177

bean-bags and examples of visual illusions. The competitive nature of some of the activities engaged

178

children and their siblings, whilst certificates and other small prizes were available as a reward.

179

Crucially, children were invited to try out ASTEROID (version 0.932 and 0.933) and comment on any

180

aspect of the design. Opinions were gathered by research assistants: CB, TC, JH, and SR. CB and SR

195

Outcomes of PPI. Observations of some children indicated a lack of understanding of the gameplay.

196

For example, for a 2-year old boy it was noted that he “only played a few trials and showed no

197

understanding of what to do”. A similar observation was made for another 2-year old girl: “Happy to

198

play but didn’t understand”, and for a 1.5 year old girl: “Didn't understand, mum modelled a lot”. In

199

many children we observed hesitation on how to proceed at the end of the non-stereo practice

200

trials, indicating a gap in understanding on what to do during the non-stereo and stereo stages of

201

the game. In addition, comments made during sessions indicated that the colour cue in combination

202

with the colourful dots in the non-stereo trials primed children to look for a local colour change in a

203

few dots instead of an overall depth change in the stereo trials.

204

Second, some children had difficulties understanding that on each trial the locations of the target

205

was randomly determined. In subsequent trials, these children would tap all four stereograms in

206

alternation. For instance, if they incorrectly tapped the top left stereogram in one trial, in the next

207

trial they would not revisit this location but instead try for instance the top right location. If the

208

target was not found there, they would move to yet another position in the third trial. This seemed

209

to indicate that children did not understand that the placement was random, but imagined that the

210

target location remained the same until it was found.

211

Stage 3: Implementing changes

212

Methods. Feedback from Stage 2 was summarised by research assistants and discussed at a cross-

213

disciplinary meeting attended by vision scientists, computer scientists and game developers. Once

214

consensus was reached, the proposed changes were implemented in a new version of ASTEROID.

215

Results. To solve the first problem, we replaced the colour cue by a frame (Figure 4). The second

216

problem was solved by adding a card shuffle animation. At the end of the trial, the stereograms

217

would flip around, move to the centre of the screen, mix up, move out again to the four corners of

218

the display and flip back face up (see video clip at https://youtu.be/w8q-4uejwdk ). The animations

226

Stage 4: Post-measure

227

Participants. 52 children between 4.5 and 6 years old (median age = 5, IQR = 0.4, 27 boys and 25

228

girls) participated in Stage 4. They completed the ASTEROID stereotest (version 0.938) and other

229

vision tests in the context of a larger validation study.

230

Procedures. Ethical procedures, data collection procedures and outcome measures were the same as

231

in Stage 1.

232

Impact of PPI. 4% of the children showed a poor understanding of the ASTEROID task (defined as less

233

than 80% correct on the practice trials) after we implemented the shuffle animation and the frame

234

cue in the practice trials, compared to 39% before the changes were made. The proportion of

235

correct practice trials significantly increased from an average of 0.76 in the pre-measure to 0.97 in

236

the post-measure (Welch two-sample t-test: t(231)=14.29, p<.001). However, we observed a similar

237

average number of verbal instructions that needed to be given (mean in both pre and post-measures

238

= 10; Welch two-sample t-test: t(77)=0.81, p =.42).

Level and nature of involvement. The public was involved through eight PPI sessions (Table 2). All

252

people involved were given the opportunity to try out ASTEROID (version 0.938-0.94) in drop-in

253

sessions similar to those described in Study 1. Children under 12 were asked for individual feedback

254

and engagement ratings. Sessions with adults were set up to obtain verbal reports on understanding

255

the ASTEROID stereotest.

The outcome measures were the same as in Study 1.

Outcomes of PPI. Adults described the target as ‘a square’, ‘centre that sort of sticks out’, ‘popping

out and behind’. The outline of the square seems to become more difficult to see at lower disparities

263

when adults described it as ‘a circle appears’, ‘something looks off’, ‘ I can see 3D without square’

264

and even ‘going with the gut’. We used these variety of ways to describe the 3D target to the

265

children but observed that children find it difficult to understand any verbal description of a 3D

266

target. However, once they have seen the target in 3D for the first time, they understand what they

267

need to look out for in the subsequent trials.

268

Stage 3: Implementing changes

269

Methods. Just as in Study 1, feedback from Stage 2 was discussed at a cross-disciplinary meeting and

270

consensus changes were implemented in a new version of ASTEROID.

271

Results. We decided to provide the children with a visual and tactile aid to explain them what our 3D

272

target looks like. We therefore made a cardboard demo of an ASTEROID trial. The demo show a print

273

screen of a trial as the background. In the bottom right location, a square with the same dot pattern

274

as the background was glued on top of the background with a 2mm cardboard layer in between

275

(Figure 5).

279

Participants. 53 participants between 2 and 40 years old (median age = 10.8, IQR = 5.1, 17 boys and

280

36 girls) participated in Stage 4. They completed the ASTEROID stereotest (version 0.940) with

281

additional cardboard instructions in the context of a larger validation study.

282

Procedures. Ethical procedures, data collection procedures and outcome measures were the same as

283

in Stage 1.

284

Impact of PPI. 6% of the participants showed a poor understanding of the ASTEROID task (defined as

285

less than 80% correct on the practice trials) after we implemented the cardboard instructions

286

compared to 4% without the cardboard instructions. There was no significant increase in average

287

proportion of correct practice trials between pre- and post-measure (mean proportion correct in

288

pre- and post-measure = 0.97; Welch two-sample t-test: t(92)=-0.02, p=.98). However, we found a

289

significant decrease in the average number of additional verbal instructions given from 10 to 8

290

(Welch two-sample t-test: t(103)=3.72, p<.001). An age difference between the pre- and post-

291

measure might possibly confound this effect, we therefore rerun our analyses including only subjects

292

younger than 9 years old (n=22, median age = 6.3, IQR = 3.4, 8 boys and 14 girls). This indeed

293

resulted in an insignificant difference in the number of additional verbal instructions given (Welch

294

Two sample t-test: t(31)=0.83, p=.41).

295

Study 3: Engagement with ASTEROID

296

Our primary aim was to increase children’s understanding of ASTEROID, however ASTEROID score

297

can only reflect stereo ability if thresholds are not inflated by poor motivation. ASTEROID is

298

therefore embedded in a game and different game themes are available to engage children with

299

different interests. We monitored engagement levels during the development of ASTEROID.

300

Methods

301

Five groups of children and adults were involved in evaluating engagement (Table 3). The groups are

302

described in detail above. Group 4 was a subset of the children and adults involved in Stage 2 of

303

Study 2 (session 4-5). Different outcome measures were collected from different groups (see Table

304

3). We monitored the number of encouragements given by the researchers during game play, such

305

as ‘Keep going’, ‘Well done’, ‘Just have a go’, etc. In other groups, children rated their level of

312

Results

313

ASTEROID was rated as a fun game by the children with an average rating of 4.8 in Study 1 and 4.7 in

314

Study 2. The implementation of the frame and the shuffle animation did not change the rating

315

(Welch two-sample t-test: t(68) = 0.91, p = 0.36). Although engagement was not the primary aim of

316

the PPI sessions, occasionally positive engagement with ASTEROID was spontaneously noted by the

317

research assistants, for instance ‘Really enjoyed it, laughed at triangle/prize coming up’, ‘Happy to

318

play’, ‘Liked simple [game] but preferred chicken story better’. We found a significant increase of

319

average number of encouragements from 9.6 to 13.8 after we implemented the shuffle animation

320

and the frame cue (Welch two-sample t-test: t(64)=8.25, p<.001). This indicated that children

321

needed more encouragement and ASTEROID was less engaging after Study 1, possibly because of

322

the additional time occupied by the shuffle animation. However, the average number of

323

encouragements significantly reduced to 8.0 after we added the cardboard demo (Welch two

324

sample t-test: t(103)=8.32, p<.001).

Discussion

326

Our aim was to improve children’s understanding of the instructions of a new stereotest that

327

measures 3D vision, ASTEROID. Through two PPI studies, we consulted 233 children and adults, an

328

unprecedented number in studies with children. The insights based on their feedback were

329

extremely valuable for the development team and we made three major changes in subsequent

330

versions of ASTEROID: (1) we replaced the colour cue by a frame cue; (2) we added a shuffle

331

animation to explain that the target could appear in any location on the next trial; (3) we made a

332

visual and tactile cardboard demo to explain to the children what target they were looking for in

333

ASTEROID.

334

The involvement of the public and the changes we made to ASTEROID following their feedback had

335

major impact on the level of understanding of ASTEROID. We noticed a substantial increase in the

336

average proportion of practice trials answered correctly after implementing the frame cue and the

337

shuffle animation. In addition, the percentage of children that showed a poor understanding of

338

ASTEROID (< 80% correct on practice trials) reduced. The impact on the number of additional verbal

339

instructions given to the child during ASTEROID is less straightforward. We observed a slight increase

340

after making the first set of changes, but this decreased again after we included the cardboard

341

demo. This seems to indicate that the cardboard demo was able to replace some of the verbal

342

instructions, while the frame cue and shuffle animation were not. Given the nature of the problem

343

that these changes were trying to solve and the type of verbal instructions given, this is not that

344

surprising. Most verbal instructions were variations on what target to look out for: ‘Tap the one that

345

is different’, ‘Which one is sticking out’, ‘Do any look like they are popping out’? The cardboard

346

demo was included because children had difficulties understanding any verbal descriptions of the 3D

347

target. So, including a visual and tactile aid removed the need for additional verbal instructions. On

348

the other hand, the frame cue and the shuffle animation were solving rather different problems, not

349

directly related to the verbal instructions given.

350

Our study provides a major contribution to an evidence pool of involvement of children and young

351

people in research. With typical sample sizes of 5-20 children or young people 17–19, our sample of

352

233 people (of which 165 were under 12) is a major step forward in hearing a wide range of

353

opinions. In addition, our study is the first to involve children as young as 1 year old. 30% of our

354

sample are children of 3 years old or younger. Instead of asking parents’ opinions as is commonly

355

done with children that age 2,5, we describe methods to successfully gain opinions directly from very

356

young children: using smiley face rating scales for engagement level and using observations and

357

simple questions to investigate understanding of the task. For more in-depth knowledge on the

358

reasoning of solving an ASTEROID trial, we relied on verbal reports from adults unfamiliar with 3D

359

computer tablets. A third strength of our study is the quantitative way in which we measured the

360

impact of our PPI through pre- and post-measures, demonstrating a positive and measurable effect

361

of PPI on research.

362

The impact of our PPI was possibly limited by the type of people we involved. By running most of our

363

PPI session in public places and through drop-in sessions, we aimed to lower the barriers for

364

involvement. However, most children involved were visiting a local science or history museum with

365

their parents. Museum visitors do not necessarily reflect general demographics. In addition, one of

366

the museum (Centre for Life) has an entrance fee of £11 for adults and £6.50 for children between 5

367

and 17. This probably caused an underrepresentation of children from lower socio-economic

368

backgrounds. A second limitation of our study is that the median age of participants in our post-

369

measure of Study 2 (median age = 10.8) was higher than in our pre-measure (median age = 5). Our

370

analyses on a subsample of the younger children indeed suggests that increased understanding was

371

mediated by increased age in our sample rather than the cardboard change we have implemented. A

372

larger sample of younger children is needed to confirm this.

373

We learned the following lessons from our PPI sessions that might be useful for other researchers.



374
375

The drop-in nature of our sessions required very little commitment of the children and the
parents, which lowered the barrier for involvement.



376

Besides ASTEROID we brought a range of activities and games related to vision and the brain

377

to engage the public, parents and siblings. This certainly helped to attract and engage

378

people.


379

We set up our stall/table with activities in a central place in the venue with high volume of

380

passage rather than opting for a quiet separate room as is usually preferred for research in

381

public places.


382

The experience of our team in working with children – both clinically and in schools – was

383

extremely valuable. They were able to make children feel at ease, bring over their

384

enthusiasm and be sensitive to a child’s individual needs.

385

In conclusion, children’s contributions have measurably impacted on the development of ASTEROID,

386

a new stereotest for children. By increasing accessibility and through creative methods we gathered

387

feedback from 165 children between 1 and 12 years old and 68 older children and adults. The

388

changes implemented following their feedback significantly improved our stereotest. Our approach

389

can be inspirational for future researchers and contribute to an evidence pool of good-practice in

390

involvement of children and young people in research.
