Abstract
Background: EBV infection is thought to play a central role in the development of Multiple
Sclerosis (MS). If causal, it represents a target for interventions to reduce MS risk.
Objective: To examine the evidence for interaction between EBV and other risk factors, and
explore mechanisms via which EBV infection may influence MS risk.
Methods: Pubmed was searched using the terms “multiple sclerosis” AND “Epstein Barr
virus”, “multiple sclerosis” AND EBV, “clinically isolated syndrome” AND “Epstein Barr
virus” and “clinically isolated syndrome” AND EBV. All abstracts were reviewed for
possible inclusion.
Results: 262 full-text papers were reviewed. There was evidence of interaction on the
additive scale between anti-EBV antibody titre and HLA genotype (AP 0.48, p<1x10-4; RERI
3.84, p<5x10-3; S 1.68, p=0.06). Previous IM was associated with increased OR of MS in
HLA-DRB1*1501 positive but not HLA-DRB1*1501 negative persons. Smoking was
associated with a greater risk of MS in those with high anti-EBV antibodies (OR 2.76) but
not low anti-EBV antibodies (OR 1.16). No interaction between EBV and risk factors was
found on a multiplicative scale.
Conclusions: EBV appears to interact with at least some established MS risk factors. The
mechanism via which EBV influences MS risk remains unknown.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to arise as the result of acquired environmental risk in a
genetically susceptible population1–4. Environmental risk factors for MS include Epstein-Barr
Virus (EBV) infection, smoking, obesity during adolescence, and low serum vitamin D2.
Understanding how environmental risk factors interact with each other and with genotype is
crucial to developing targeted preventative strategies.

We set out to update and extend our understanding of the interaction between EBV and other
MS risk factors. To our knowledge, there has been no previous attempt to integrate all data
related to how EBV interacts with other MS risk factors. One meta-analysis has examined the
potential interaction between EBV serostatus and HLA in MS; other previous meta-analyses
have not studied risk factor interaction5–8.

Nested case-control studies using large health repositories9,10 have made a major contribution
to epidemiological evidence supporting a causal relationship between EBV and MS.
However, the high rate of EBV seropositivity in the general population argues against EBV
seropositivity alone being a sufficient factor for causing MS7. The prevalence of MS in EBVnegative individuals is virtually zero when highly sensitive techniques are used to assess
EBV serostatus11,12. Symptomatic EBV5–7,13–15 infection (Infectious Mononucleosis; IM)
confers a greater risk of MS than asymptomatic EBV carriage.

Population-based epidemiological studies indicate that EBV infection and other
environmental risk factors may interact with genotype in the pathogenesis of MS 16. To our
knowledge there have been no previous attempts to systematically pool these estimates. In

this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine all the available evidence for EBV
interaction with other MS risk factors (both in terms of EBV serostatus and IM) using both
multiplicative and additive models for interaction. We also examine the reported relationship
between EBV and MS, and pool evidence around the relationship between active EBV
turnover (as measured by PCR) and MS. Finally, we provide a narrative systematic review of
the literature around MS and EBV.

Methods
Search strategy
Pubmed was searched using the terms “multiple sclerosis” AND “Epstein Barr virus”,
“multiple sclerosis” AND EBV, “clinically isolated syndrome” AND “Epstein Barr virus”
and “clinically isolated syndrome” AND EBV. Search dates were 1950-present. The most
recent search was performed on 22nd December 2018.

All abstracts were reviewed for possible inclusion. Studies for use in the meta-analysis were
screened according to the following criteria: containing both MS and control group, and using
either standard techniques to establish EBV serostatus, history of IM, or PCR. Where these
criteria were met, the full text was retrieved.

Following this, relevant studies were reviewed and data extracted. Where full text was not
available, the authors were contacted to provide the article. Where it was judged unclear as to
whether data within selected papers met the inclusion criteria (details of inclusion criteria for
each analysis are given in the results section), a second co-author independently reviewed the
paper, and a consensus decision was reached. The quality of data were assessed by recording
the reported security of MS diagnosis (no clear criteria and/or self-reported vs. explicit

criteria used for diagnosis, the gold standard), and technique for assessing EBV (ELISA vs.
immunofluorescence, the gold standard). All references of retrieved review and/or metaanalyses were reviewed for additional articles not captured during the original search.

Technical differences between study design may introduce bias and limit the validity of
pooled effect estimates. Such differences included: differences in clinical criteria for MS
diagnosis, differences in method of IM diagnosis (clinical, recall questionnaire, serological),
differences in laboratory techniques (e.g. immunoflourescence vs ELISA), differences in
HLA genotyping (molecular typing vs SNP imputation), and difference in the quantification
of smoking exposure (cotinine vs questionnaire). To overcome these difficulties, we
performed subgroup analyses where appropriate to stratify by these potential sources of
heterogeneity.

All included full text papers were assigned to analyses covered by this review - EBV
interaction with other MS risk factors, serology and MS risk, infectious mononucleosis and
MS risk, EBV DNA detection and MS, papers covering possible mechanisms of EBV
contribution to MS risk, and papers examining the relationship between immune response to
EBV and MS-related clinical or MRI outcomes. A single paper could be assigned to any
number of analyses, and each analysis/review was performed independently of all others.

Statistical methods
Meta-analyses were conducted in R v3.6.0 using the ‘meta’ package based on reported data.
Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a Mantel-Haenszel random effects model with a
continuity correction. Bias was quantified using the efficient score (a linear regression of

funnel plot asymmetry)17. For interaction studies, odds ratios were pooled using the inverse
variance method. Where data were available, unadjusted odds ratios were calculated.

For interaction studies, the highest and lowest exposure groups were used - e.g. where EBNA
titres were divided into quartiles, we took the lowest and the highest groups as ‘EBNA lo’
and ‘EBNA hi’ respectively. Interaction was assessed by calculating 4 measures of
interaction: where the numbers of cases and controls in each risk factor group were presented,
the Attributable Proportion due to interaction (AP), the relative excess risk due to interaction
(RERI), the Synergy index (S), and multiplicative interaction18,19 were calculated. For two
risk factors of interest, e.g. smoking and HLA status, if OR11 indicates the Odds Ratio for MS
in individuals exposed to both risk factors, OR10 the OR for HLA+ non-smokers and OR01
that for HLA- smokers:

RERI = OR11 – OR10 – OR01 + 1

S = OR11 – 1 / ( (OR10 – 1) – (OR01 – 1) )

AP = (OR11 – OR10 – OR01 + 1)/ OR11

In the absence of interaction, RERI and AP will be 0, and S will be 1. Measures of departure
from additivity (AP, RERI, and S) were calculated using the indicator variable method
described previously19 in R (code available on request). Multiplicative interaction was
calculated by performing logistic regression with an interaction term. If OR represents the
Odds Ratio for MS, x1 one risk factor, x2 the second risk factor, and x1x2 the product
(interaction) term, then:

Ln(OR) = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x1x2

The exponent of the interaction term coefficient b3 represents the multiplicative interaction
between the two risk factors. For these analyses, the regression model did not adjust for
variables other than the two risk factors in question. Standard errors were calculated for
measures of additive interaction using the delta method19. Standard errors for the
multiplicative interaction were calculated from the output of the logistic regression model.
Meta-analysis of interaction terms was performed using the inverse variance method with a
random effects model.

Data availability statement
This work was performed using published data. All data sources are listed in the references
and supplementary references. All R code used for the analysis are available on request.

Results
A total of 632 references were retrieved using the search terms “multiple sclerosis” AND
“Epstein Barr virus”, and “multiple sclerosis” AND EBV. “Multiple sclerosis” AND EBV,
“clinically isolated syndrome” retrieved 22 references, all of which had been captured in the
previous search. “Clinically isolated syndrome” AND EBV retrieved a further 17 references,
again all of which had been previously captured. Review of all references of meta-analyses
and systematic reviews provided 6 unique new results. 370 results were discarded following
review of abstracts for reasons including pre-selecting EBV positive patients only, having no
control group, validation studies of new methods for EBV serology. 262 full text papers were
reviewed and included as summarized in Fig. 1.

EBV interaction with HLA-DRB1*1501 in MS
10 papers20–28 were included for this analysis. All but one paper presented HLA-DRB1*1501
homo- and heterozygotes pooled into a single group (“HLA positive”), and so this grouping
was used in the analysis. Where EBNA titres were divided into quartiles, we took the highest
and lower quartiles to represent ‘high’ and ‘low’ titres respectively. One paper26 was
excluded due to overlapping participants with another paper22.

The odds ratio (OR) of MS in individuals with high anti-EBV antibody titres is increased in
HLA-DRB1*1501 positive (OR 7.17, 95% CI 3.92 - 13.14) compared to HLA-DRB1*1501
negative individuals (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.86 - 4.59, Fig. 2, Table 1). Studies differed in their
method of HLA genotyping. Restricting the analysis to studies using tagging SNPs
(rs3135005 or rs9271366) did not significantly alter the results (Fig. S1). Restricting the
analysis to studies using PCR-based methods yielded a similar result (Fig. S1).

Individual-level data were available for five studies. We estimated the degree of interaction
between HLA status and EBNA titre by calculating the AP, Synergy Index, RERI, and the
degree of multiplicative interaction as described above. There was evidence of significant
interaction between EBNA titre and HLA genotype on the additive scale in terms of the AP
and RERI (AP 0.48, p<1x10-4; RERI 3.84, p<5x10-3; S 1.68, p=0.06). There was no evidence
of interaction on the multiplicative scale (ߚ 1.27, p=0.74) (Fig. 2, Table 1). Subgroup
analyses based on method of HLA genotyping are presented in table S1.

Four papers examined the potential interaction between previous infectious mononucleosis
and HLA-DRB1*1501 status and MS20,22,28,29. Again, homo- and heterozygote status was
pooled into “HLA positive”. A history of IM is associated with increased OR of MS in HLADRB1*1501 positive individuals (OR 5.11 95% CI 2.00-13.03; p<1x10-3) but not in HLADRB1*1501 negative individuals (OR 1.22 95% CI 0.33-4.48; p=0.77, Fig. 3, Table 2).
Three studies had individual-level data available. There was no significant interaction on the
additive or multiplicative scales between HLA status and IM in the meta-analysis of 3 studies
with individual-level data available (figure 3, Table 2). Subgroup analysis by method of HLA
genotyping did not significantly alter the results (Fig. S2).

EBV interaction with smoking in MS
5 papers studied the potential interaction between smoking status and anti-EBV antibody
titre25,26,28,30,31. Three studies stratified smoke exposure as ever vs never smokers, one study
used second-hand smoke exposure as a variable, and one study distinguished active from
inactive smoking using serum cotinine levels. Smoking is associated with a greater risk of
MS in those with high anti-EBV antibodies (OR 2.76 95%CI 2.13-3.59; p<1x10-5) but not in
those with low anti-EBV antibodies (OR 1.16 95%CI 0.95-1.42; p=0.15). There was no
significant interaction on the multiplicative or additive scales in the meta-analysis of the four
eligible studies (Fig. 4, Table 3). Exclusion of either the study using second-hand smoke as
the exposure or using serum cotinine as a proxy for smoking did not significantly affect the
results (Table S2).

EBV interaction with vitamin D in MS risk
Only 2 studies presented data on both EBV and vitamin D in MS3233. One of these studies
looked at vitamin D levels in people with established MS32, and the other in samples taken

both prior to and following MS onset, with multiple, variable sampling points per
participant33. One study applied a correction to vitamin D levels for month of sampling33, the
other did not32. In addition, one study using a single EBNA epitope33, whereas the other
looked at specific ENA-1 domains32. Neither study demonstrated any interaction between
vitamin D level and anti-EBNA titre, however for the reasons above they were not pooled.

EBV interaction with obesity in MS risk
Only one study examined the potential interaction between EBV and obesity in risk of MS34.
This study demonstrated a striking potential interaction on an additive scale with an
attributable proportion due to interaction of 0.8 (95%CI 0.6-1.0) in the incident study, and in
the prevalent study an attributable proportion due to interaction of 0.7 (95%CI 0.5-1.0)34.

EBV seropositivity and MS
56 papers were included in the final analysis for this analysis (supplementary references).
Inclusion criteria were MS and control group, no pre-selection of groups based on EBV
serostatus and history of IM, EBV serology measured using clearly defined methods. Reasons
for exclusion included not having a control group and pre-selecting EBV positive patients.
Studies were separated into those examining adult vs. paediatric MS populations given the
reported differences in seroprevalence between the two groups. Following an assessment of
data quality, validatory analyses were performed limiting studies to those deemed to be of
high quality. Seropositivity for EBV was calculated by pooling results from studies which
reported seropositivity to either EBNA, VCA, or both. Where both were reported, the EBNA
data were used. Studies using different EBNA1 and EBNA2 epitopes were pooled for all
analysis.

EBV seropositivity was significantly more common among people with MS (adults and
children) than controls (n=15554, 56 studies, OR 3.62, 95% CI 2.83-4.83, Fig. 5). There was
evidence of significant heterogeneity (Q=168.37, p<1x10-4) and publication bias (p<0.05).
Overall, 6479/7395 people with MS were EBV seropositive (87.6%) compared with
6205/8159 EBV seropositive control subjects (76.1%). EBV seropositivity was more
prevalent among adults with MS compared to controls (n=13768, 46 studies, OR 3.27, 95%
CI 2.45-4.35, p<1x10-4 ). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies (Q=134.5
p<x10-4) and evidence of publication bias (p=0.0196), with studies demonstrating a
relationship between EBV infection and MS more likely to be published. Overall, 5805/6606
adults with MS were EBV seropositive (87.9%) compared with 5702/7162 adult control
subjects (79.6%). EBV seropositivity was more common among children with MS or CIS
than controls (n=1786, 10 studies, OR 4.93, 95% CI 3.83-6.36, p<1x10-4). There was no
evidence of heterogeneity (Q=5.76, p=0.76) and no evidence of publication bias (p=0.622).
Overall, 674/789 children with MS were EBV seropositive (85.4%) compared with 485/997
control subjects (48.6%).

IgG reactivity to the Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) was more prevalent among adults with MS
(n=7688, 23 studies, OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.88-5.38, p<1x10-4, data not shown). There was
substantial heterogeneity between studies (Q=73.27, p<1x10-4) and no evidence of
publication bias (p=0.062). Overall, VCA seropositivity was present in 3414/3698 (92.3%) of
adults with MS compared with 3595/3990 controls (90.1%). Reactivity to the EBNA antigen
was again more prevalent among people with MS compared to controls (n=9537, 33 studies,
OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.53-4.56, p<1x10-4, data not shown). There was substantial heterogeneity
between studies (Q=71.5, p<1x10-4) with evidence of publication bias in these studies

(p<0.01). Overall, EBNA seropositivity was present in 4260/4805 (88.7%) of adults with MS
compared with 3660/4732 (77.3%) controls.

The increased seroprevalence of EBV infection in people with MS/CIS remained significant
when restricting included studies to those using the more sensitive technique of
immunofluorescence (rather than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to detect EBV
antibodies (OR 4.61, 95% CI 1.86-11.40). Similarly, when restricting included studies to
those which used explicit diagnostic criteria to define MS, this effect remained significant
(OR 3.44, 95% CI 2.56-4.61)

Infectious mononucleosis and MS
32 full text papers were reviewed for this analysis, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria
(supplementary references). Inclusion criteria were MS and control group, clearly stated
methods for obtaining a previous history of IM, and no selection on the basis of reported
history of IM.

Previous Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) was more common in people with MS (n=107243,
19 studies, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.79-2.23, p<x10-4, Fig. 6). There was significant heterogeneity
(Q=37.28, p=0.0048) but no evidence of publication bias (p=0.45, Fig. 6). This effect
remained significant when restricting studies to those using criteria-defined MS (OR 1.94,
95% CI 1.72-2.18, Fig. 6).

EBV DNA detectable by PCR.
31 full text papers were reviewed and 23 included in the analysis (supplementary references).
8 papers studied EBV DNA in CSF, 3 in whole blood, 7 in peripheral blood mononuclear

cells, 4 in plasma/serum and 1 in saliva. The EBNA gene was the most commonly used for
EBV detection (9 studies), with BAM used in 4 studies, VCA in 3 studies, and LMP in 2
studies.

EBV DNA was detectable in whole blood/PBMC more often in people with MS versus
controls (n = 1853, 9 studies, OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.7360-6.9659, p<5x10-4). There was
evidence of significant heterogeneity (Q=48.94, p<1x10-4) but no evidence of publication
bias (p=0.78). Detection of EBV DNA did not differ between MS and control serum/plasma
samples (n = 607, OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.77-4.26; p=0.18) or CSF (n = 802, OR 1.74, 95% CI
0.97-3.12, p = 0.062).

Discussion and conclusions

There is a considerable body of epidemiological evidence implicating EBV in the
pathogenesis of MS. EBV infection appears to be a necessary but not sufficient requirement
for developing MS, EBV seroprevalence is higher among people with MS, symptomatic EBV
infection (IM) is more prevalent among people with MS, and the effect of anti-EBV antibody
titre on MS risk appears contingent on the strongest genetic risk factor for MS, the HLADRB1*1501 genotype.

In our meta-analysis of interaction between EBV and other risk factors, we demonstrate
evidence for supra-additive interaction between EBNA titre and HLA status in determining
risk. The absence of strong evidence for interaction between EBV and other risk factors in
our analysis demonstrates the importance of using multiple measures of interaction (AP,

RERI, Synergy Index, and multiplicative interaction) to avoid the risk of type 1 error.
Relying on the Attributable Proportion alone to make inferences about interaction may be
misleading. However, the small number of studies suitable for our analysis of interaction
limits the power of this meta-analysis, and therefore conclusions about interaction should be
drawn cautiously from these results.

The mechanism via which EBV exerts this increased risk remains unknown, and our
systematic review of the literature highlights a multitude of potential biological mechanisms
that have been both demonstrated, replicated, and importantly not replicated. It seems likely
that the route via which EBV exerts its effect lies in complex interactions between EBV and
the host genome, the precise mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated. Despite the
relatively small retrospective studies that have been performed, it also appears clear that IgG
titres against EBV antigens are not able to act as a clinically useful biomarker in either treated
or untreated cohorts.

Our results for the seroprevalence of EBV among people with MS are consistent with the
previously published meta-analysis, which reported ORs of 4.47 (95%CI 3.26-6.11) and 4.51
(95%CI 2.84-7.16) for EBNA and VCA respectively. Our estimates of 3.39 (95%CI 2.534.56) and 3.18 (95%CI 1.88-5.38) are more conservative, likely reflecting new, larger studies
with smaller effect sizes and our different inclusion criteria7. Similarly, our estimates of
measures of interaction between EBNA titre, HLA status, and MS risk are similar, though not
identical, to the published meta-analysis estimates35. The reasons for this discrepancy are not
clear.

An EBV vaccine has previously been developed, which prevents IM but not EBV
seroconversion

. Newer vaccines are entering phase I clinical studies. The data above

indicates that IM carries an odds ratio of 5.11 in individuals with a high genetic risk preventing IM in this population has the potential to significantly reduce MS risk.
Approximately 50% of the general population are EBV seronegative at age 15

37

; hence

vaccination in early adolescence to prevent IM seems an appropriate route both reduce IMassociated morbidity and subsequent EBV-related disease.

Despite the evidence above, not all epidemiological aspects of MS can be explained by EBV
infection. The relatively short latency between putative infection and subsequent MS seen in
the Faroe epidemics, and the decreasing risk in migrants moving from high- to low-risk areas
cannot be explained purely by EBV infection - the fact remains that MS is overwhelmingly
likely to be the result of multiple environmental risk modifiers. However, evidence for EBV
infection as an obligate step in MS development is increasing, and with vaccination on the
