Abstract

20

Background: With the improved life expectancy in people living with HIV, predicting

21

individual frailty is important for clinical care. DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged as

22

a robust biomarker in precision medicine and has been previously linked to aging and

23

mortality in non-HIV populations. Here, we aim to establish a panel of DNAm features

24

selected from blood methylome to predict frailty in HIV-positive men from a veteran

25

population, Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS).

26

Methods: We used a well-established score, VACS Index, as a measure of frailty.

27

Samples (ntotal=1,150) were divided into a training set (n=612) and a validation set

28

(n=538). We first selected a panel of frailty-associated CpGs by conducting an

29

epigenome-wide association analysis on the VACS index in the training set. We then

30

applied four machine learning methods to build models to predict high and low frailty

31

individuals in the training set. The prediction models were tested in the validation set. A

32

methylation score constructed from the selected CpGs was tested an associated with

33

mortality by performing survival analysis. To assess the biological relevance of the

34

selected CpG sites, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis.

35

Results: A panel of 119 CpGs were identified from the training set (False Discovery

36

Rate <0.2) that showed excellent performance on predicting high frailty individuals with

37

Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.835 (95%CI: 0.792, 0.879) and balanced accuracy of

38

0.693. The same panel showed good performance on predicting low frailty individuals

39

with AUC of 0.735 (95%CI: 0.688-0.782) and a balanced accuracy of 0.528. The

40

methylation score from the 119 CpGs was significantly associated with 5-year and 10-

41

year mortality with hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI:1.033, 1.897 p=0.03) and 1.48 (95%CI:

43

that were significantly enriched in 9 biological pathways relevant to immune and

44

inflammation response.

45

Conclusions: We identified a panel of predictive DNAm features associated with frailty

46

and mortality among HIV-positive population. These DNAm features may serve as

47

biomarkers to discriminate high and low frailty people who live with HIV.

Background
Combination antiretroviral therapy has significantly improved life expectancy

55

among HIV-positive individuals. The prolonged life expectancy increases frailty risk in

56

the HIV population. The prevalence of frailty in people living with HIV is significantly

57

higher and onset of frailty occurs at an earlier age compared to the general population

58

(1). High frailty is characterized by marked vulnerability and is associated with increased

59

mortality. Thus, prediction of frailty is important to identify vulnerable group and deliver

60

clinical care to highly vulnerable HIV-positive patients. At present, frailty is usually

61

defined by clinical symptoms (e.g., Fried's frailty phenotype, Rockwood and Mitnitski's

62

Frailty Index) or a combination of lab tests that indicate organ damage such as the

63

Veterans Aging Cohort Study index (VACS index) (2). No biomarkers available to

64

capture the early stage of the frailty to predict individual vulnerability in HIV-positive

65

patients.

66

A large body of evidence has demonstrated that epigenetic modification adapts

67

internal and external environmental changes and that is associated with early stage of

68

pathophysiological processes (3-6). DNAm, one type of the most widely studied

69

epigenetic marks, is strongly related with aging (7-9), substance use (e.g. cigarette

70

smoking and alcohol consumption) (10-16), and a variety of diseases (3-6, 17, 18).

71

Because DNAm is relatively stable and easy to detect from body fluids biospecimen

72

through non-invasive procedure, DNAm marks have emerged as robust biomarkers for

73

cancer diagnosis (19), disease subtype classification (20, 21) and treatment response

74

monitoring (22, 23).

75

DNAm may play an important role in frailty among HIV-positive individuals. Frailty

76

is associated with elevated inflammation markers such as IL-6 and hsCRP in HIV-

77

positive individuals (24). Genes involved in immune and inflammation processes are

78

also subject to epigenetic modification in immune cells. We previously reported

79

association of two CpG sites in the promoter region of NLRC5 with HIV infection (25),

80

and NLRC5 gene is a major transcriptional activator of MHC class I gene. DNAm was

81

also linked to HIV comorbid medical diseases such as HIV-positive diabetes and kidney

82

function (26, 27). Furthermore, aging, a critical contributor to frailty, is significantly

83

associated with thousands of CpGs in the epigenome, and the epigenetic clock and

84

DNAm age are becoming widely recognized (7-9). DNAm age is significantly correlated

85

with physical frailty in HIV-negative individuals (28) and HIV-positive individuals (29). In

86

HIV-positive individuals, the average DNAm age is accelerated 5 to 10 years faster than

87

HIV-negative individuals (30-33) and 10 years faster in the HIV-positive frailty

88

individuals in comparing to HIV-positive non-frailty individuals (29). These age-related

89

DNAm signatures are predictive of mortality (34-38). Additional CpGs in blood have

90

been identified to predict all-cause mortality (34, 39). Therefore, we hypothesize that

91

DNAm is associated with frailty and that DNAm signatures in blood can serve as

92

biomarkers to predict frailty and mortality among HIV-positive individuals.

93

In this study, our goal is to identify DNAm marks that can serve as biomarkers

94

on frailty and to link frailty-associated DNAm to mortality among HIV-positive

95

individuals. We also evaluated biological relevance of the identified CpG sites. We used

96

a well-established frailty score, VACS index, as a measure of frailty in the HIV-positive

97

population. The VACS index is a composite score constructed by a sum of pre-assigned

Methods
As an overview, our analytical procedure is shown in the flowchart in Figure 1.

106

Our sample was divided into the training set (n=612) and the validation set (n=538)

107

which DNA methylation were processed at different time and using two different

108

platforms. We first selected a panel of CpG sites relevant to frailty based on EWAS

109

results in the training set. Then, we applied four commonly used machine learning

110

classification methods to develop prediction models: random forest, Extreme Gradient

111

Boosting Tree (XGBoost), Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear

112

Models (GLMNET), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The selected CpG sites were

113

used as predictors to differentiate high and low frailty in the training set and each model

114

was evaluated in the validation set. Additionally, the DNAm score was constructed

115

based on the selected CpG sites and we conducted survival analysis to assess whether

116

the DNAm score was associated with mortality in the HIV-positive samples. Lastly, we

117

conducted a gene ontology enrichment analysis to reveal the underlying biological

118

pathways of the selected CpG sites.

All samples in the training and validating sets were from the VACS cohort. The

121

VACS is a prospective cohort study of veterans focusing on clinical outcomes in HIV

122

infection (41). DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood of 1,150 HIV-positive

123

men from the VACS. Demographic and clinical information on age, race, smoking

124

status, CD4 count, viral load, HIV medication adherence, VACS index, and mortality by

125

training set and validation set are presented in Table 1. The training set included slightly

126

older individuals, more African Americans, and greater VACS index than the validation

127

set. There was no significant difference in HIV medication adherence, CD4 count, or

128

log10 HIV-1 viral load between the training set and the validation set.

Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip. DNAm for the training and validation sets

134

were evaluated using the same quality control (QC) protocol (42) in the R package minfi

135

(43). In detail, CpG sites on sex chromosomes and within 10 base pairs of a single

136

nucleotide polymorphism were removed. The detection p-value threshold was set at 10-

137

138

HM450K and EPIC arrays were used for analysis to ensure the same coverage

139

between two sets. Proportions of 6 cell types (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, Natural Killer

141

method (Houseman et al., 2012) for all samples in the training and validation sets.

We performed an EWAS on VACS index in the training set using a two-step

144

linear model approach as previously described (42). The analytical model was adjusted

145

for systematic errors and clinical confounding factors. Here, log transformation was

146

applied to VACS index to ensure normality distribution assumption for the linear model.

147

First, the following linear model was used to extract principal components (PCs)

148

for potential confounding variables. Here, top 30 control PCs were derived from internal

149

control probes in minfi:

Second, the top 20 residual PCs were extracted in the model above to fully

153

adjust for unmeasured confounding. The final EWAS model on VACS index was:

157

To ensure a sufficient number of CpGs as predictors for the prediction model

158

development, we selected CpG sites with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.2 in the EWAS

159

as predictors.

160

Additionally, to explore the underlying epigenetic mechanism of frailty, we also

161

detected differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using bumpHunter (44) in the training

162

set. DMRs with family-wise error rate (FWER)<0.2, which is equivalent to FDR<0.03,

163

were considered significant.

164

Developing machine learning prediction models for frailty

165

Based on the distribution of the VACS index in the entire sample (Figure S1) and

166

clinical significance (45), high HIV frailty was defined as VACS index > 50, and low HIV

167

frailty was defined as VACS index < 16. Models were developed to predict high frailty

168

(VACS index >50 versus ⩽50) and low frailty (VACS index <16 versus ≥16). CpGs

169

relevant to frailty were selected from EWAS as described above. The following steps

170

were taken to develop separate prediction models on high and low frailty:

171

1) Model development in the training set: Four machine learning models, random

172

forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree (XGBoost), support vector machines(SVM),

173

Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (GLMNET), were

174

separately applied to predict VACS index by using the R package caret (46). These four

175

models are commonly used in the supervised learning on classification (47-50). Each

176

model was developed separately and 10-fold cross-validation was used in model

177

training process to minimize data overfitting.

178

2) Model evaluation in the validation set: All four models built in the training set

179

were evaluated in the validation set. Area Under Curve (AUC) and balanced accuracy

180

were used to assess the prediction performance. We used balanced accuracy for model

181

evaluation because in the presence of imbalance samples in each class since there are

182

228 subjects with VACS index greater than or equal to 50 and 916 subjects with VACS

183

index less than 916. Balanced accuracy is defined as the average accuracy obtained on

184

each class as shown in the following formula (51). Balanced accuracy was used in this

185

study to avoid biased accuracy due to imbalanced samples (51).

Selection a panel of 119 frailty-associated CpG sites by EWAS in the training set

222

In the training set, we conducted an EWAS on VACS index (Figure 2; λ=1.038) and

223

selected 119 CpGs with FDR<0.2 to ensure sufficient number of predictors (Table 2).

224

Eighty out of 119 CpGs were negatively associated with VACS index, while 39 out of

225

119 CpGs were positively associated with VACS index. The majority of CpGs were

226

located within or near known genes, except for 19 CpGs that were intergenic. Only 40

227

CpGs were located in gene bodies, while 79 CpGs were located in promoter regions,

228

first exons, or 3’ UTR. Thirty-two CpGs were located in CpG islands.

229

Notably, 22 out of 119 CpGs reached epigenome-wide significance (FDR<0.05),

230

including 16 CpG sites negatively associated with the VACS index and 6 CpG sites with

231

positive associations. These 22 CpGs were located on 17 genes, including 13 of 22

232

CpGs located in promoter regions, 6 CpGs in gene body, and 3 CpGs in 3’UTR. Among

233

these genes, some harbored more than one significant CpG. For example, three CpGs

234

were annotated within or near PSMB8 (cg01309328, p=4.44×10-9; cg08099136,

235

p=4.63×10-9; cg00533183, p=3.18×10-7), two CpGs were located near PARP9

236

(cg08122652, p=2.18×10-7; cg22930808, p=6.78×10-7), two CpG sites were located

237

near IFITM1 (cg03038262, p=5.83×10-7; cg23570810, p=1.58×10-6), and the rest of the

238

significant CpG sites were annotated to 13 genes including MX1, TAP1, ZNF32,

239

NLRC5, IFI44L.

240

We found 9 significant DMRs in the training set (Table S1). Methylation β values

241

between high and low frailty ranged from -0.15 to 0.05 in these regions. As examples, 3

In the training set, we developed our prediction models based on the selected

247

119 CpGs in the training set using four commonly used machine learning classification

248

models: XGBoost, random forest, SVM and GLMNET (47-50). Performances of four

249

prediction models are presented in Table 3. We found that AUCs ranged from 0.756 to

250

0.820 and balanced accuracies ranged from 0.509 to 0.642, suggesting that the 119

251

CpGs had good to excellent predictive performance on frailty. The performances of four

252

models were mostly comparable. For predicting high frailty, GLMNET outperformed the

253

three other models (AUC=0.783, balanced accuracy=0.642) while SVM performed

254

slightly worse (AUC=0.759, balanced accuracy = 0.618). For the prediction of low frailty,

255

XGBoost performed the best among the four models (AUC=0.820, balanced

256

accuracy=0.637) while SVM performed worst (AUC=0.756, balanced accuracy =0.594).

257

In the validation set, for the prediction of high frailty, random forest and XGBoost

258

showed the best performance. AUC of random forest model was 0.835 (95%CI: 0.792,

259

0.879) and XGBoost was 0.830 (95%CI: 0.786, 0.874) for predicting high frailty.

260

Balanced accuracy was 0.69 and 0.68, respectively, for random forest and XGBoost

261

(Figure 4). For the prediction of low frailty, XGBoost and random forest models also

262

outperformed GLMNET and SVM. AUC was 0.735 (95%CI: 0.688, 0.782) for the

263

random forest and 0.716 (95%CI: 0.669, 0762) for the XGBoost. The balanced accuracy

264

was 0.528 and 0.500 for the random forest and XGBoost, respectively.

265

These results suggest that the selected panel of 119 CpG sites were able to

266

predict frailty, and the prediction models performed better at predicting high frailty than

267

predicting low frailty. Among four machine learning methods, SVM showed poor

268

performance of predicting frailty in our samples.

DNAm score by 119 CpGs was significant associated with mortality
We constructed DNAm score based on the selected 119 CpGs, and we further

272

assessed whether VACS index-related DNAm score were associated with mortality. In

273

Figure 5, the Kaplan Meier curves during 10-year follow-up showed that the individuals

274

with high DNAm score were at higher risk of mortality than those with low DNAm

275

scores. After adjusting for confounding factors, our cox proportional hazards regression

276

model showed that the hazard ratio of 5-year and 10-year mortality comparing high and

277

low DNAm score groups were 1.40 (95%CI: 1.03-1.90, p=0.03) and 1.48 (95%CI: 1.10-

278

2.02, p=0.01) respectively. In conclusion, we found that the DNAm score constructed

279

from the 119 selected CpGs was significantly associated with mortality.

280

Biological interpretations of 119 CpGs by gene ontology enrichment analysis
The selected panel of 119 CpGs were located within or near 73 genes. Gene

281
282

ontology enrichment analysis using these 73 genes resulted in 9 significant pathways

283

with FDR<0.05 (Figure 6, Table 4). These pathways included response to type I

284

interferon response (FDR=1.05×10-7), innate immune response (FDR=3.45×10-5),

285

cytokine response (FDR=3.69×10-3) and defense response to virus (Figure 6). Our

286

findings suggested that the selected 119 CpG sites are biologically relevant to HIV

287

pathogenesis and progression.

Discussion

290

In this study, we present evidences that DNAm marks in blood are predictive of

291

frailty and are associated mortality in an HIV-positive population. We identified a panel

292

of 119 CpG sites that were highly predictive for high frailty and moderately predictive for

293

low frailty. We also found that the DNAm score constructed by these 119 CpGs was

294

strongly associated with mortality in the HIV-positive population. More importantly, these

16

295

clinically informative 119 DNAm features lied in genes involved in HIV pathogenesis and

296

progression. Thus, we discovered a panel of 119 DNAm biomarkers that add knowledge

297

to the epigenetic mechanisms underlying frailty and mortality among people living with

298

HIV.

299

We demonstrated the utility of using DNAm marks to predict frailty in HIV-positive

300

individuals. We took the several steps to avoid overfitting in developing the prediction

301

models: 1) model development and evaluation were conducted separately in training set

302

and validation set. DNAm in two sets were profiled in different time with different

303

platforms; 2) 10-fold cross validation were performed during training in each model. The

304

performances of four machine learning methods were in general consistent except that

305

the SVM did not perform well for low frailty. Our results suggested that this panel of

306

CpG sites was relatively stable and robust although performances of predictive models

307

differed using different methods. Of note, SVM showed the worst performance in

308

predicting high and low frailty that highlights the importance of choosing appropriate

309

machine learning method for model development. Compared to our previously reported

310

a panel of 698 smoking-associated CpGs that are moderately predictive of frailty (15),

311

the panel of 119 CpG sites in the present study includes fewer CpGs (119 CpGs) and

312

shows greater prediction performance on frailty (AUC=0.73 for smoking-associated

313

CpGs and AUC 0.83 for the VACS index-associated CpGs), suggesting that the panel

314

of 119 CpG sites has greater clinical utility for frailty among people living with HIV. The

315

improvement of prediction performance on frailty in the present study may be due to

316

different strategies of CpG selections. In this study, the 119 CpGs are selected from the

17

317

entire blood methylome and may be more informative than the smoking-associated

318

CpGs in our previous report.

319

We also found that the VACS index-related DNAm score derived from the 119

320

CpGs is strongly associated with mortality. This result provides further knowledge of

321

epigenetic profile into previous report that VACS index is predictive of mortality in

322

people who live with HIV (53). The result is also consistent with previous literature

323

showing that DNAm marks in blood predict mortality in the general population (39).

324

Interestingly, we found no overlapped CpG between our predictive panel and the

325

previously identified CpGs for all-cause mortality that included CpGs associated with a

326

variety of diseases such as diabetes and cancer(39). The discrepancy suggest that

327

methylation-based prediction of mortality may be relevant to causal disease. A recent

328

study reports a significant overlap of mortality-associated CpGs and aging-associated

329

CpGs (Lund et al, 2019). We found no overlapped CpG site between our mortality-

330

related 119 CpG panel and aging-related 353 CpGs in epigenetic clock (7), suggesting

331

that epigenetic mechanisms in HIV-related mortality differ from aging-related mortality.

332

Most importantly, this panel of 119 CpG sites are biologically meaningful and

333

may shed light on our understanding of the biological mechanisms of frailty for HIV-

334

positive individuals. The majority of the 119 CpG sites were located within or near

335

genes that are involved in known HIV pathology and progression. The results from DMR

336

analysis are corresponding to some of the significant genes for frailty. For example,

337

cg26312951, cg22862003 and cg21549285 from the 119 CpG sites are located in the

338

MX1 gene (Interferon-Induced GTP-Binding Protein Mx1) and were negatively

339

associated with frailty. A DMR on MX1 also showed a significant with frailty. MX1

340

encodes a GTP-metabolizing protein induced by interferon I and II and is involved in

341

interferon gamma signaling and Toll-like signaling pathway. Multiple CpGs near the

342

HLA-F and HLA-E genes are part of the predictive panel, and these two genes are

343

actively involved in immune response (54). Our previously reported HIV-associated

344

CpG site, cg07839457 in the NLRC5 gene is also a member of the predictive panel on

345

frailty (25). Other interesting gene regions reveled by DMR analysis include PARP9 and

346

IFI44L, which both genes are involved in HIV pathogenesis. The biological relevance of

347

these 119 CpG sites was further supported by the gene ontology enrichment analysis.

348

The top enriched pathways such as type I interferon response and cytokine response

349

may point out important biological pathways that leads to frailty and increased risk of

350

mortality among people living with HIV.

351

We acknowledge several limitations in this study. The generalizability of the

352

selected CpG sites may be limited since our samples were predominantly middle-aged

353

men, which may not generalize to frailty in a different age group. All samples in our

354

study are HIV-positive and the identified CpGs have a limited application to HIV-

355

negative population as we discussed above. Future studies in diverse populations is

356

warranted to validate the selected methylation features. Lastly, the prediction of low

357

frailty is moderate due to imbalanced sample distribution in our present study. We

358

expect that including more samples with low frailty will improve the predictive

359

performance.

We identified a panel of 119 predictive DNAm features in blood that are associated with

363

frailty and mortality among people living with HIV. These DNAm features may serve as

364

biomarkers to discriminate high and low frailty groups and may help to prioritize genes

365

to better understand the mechanisms of frailty in HIV-positive population. These DNAm

366

features have potential to serve as biomarkers to monitor HIV progression in future

367

clinical care.
