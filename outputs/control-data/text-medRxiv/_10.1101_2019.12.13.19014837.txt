Abstract

50
51

Background & Aims: With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), mortality rates and

52

causes of death among persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are likely to change over time.

53

However, the emergence of such trends may be delayed by the relatively slow progression of chronic

54

hepatitis C. To date, detailed analyses of cause-specific mortality among HCV-infected persons over

55

time remain limited.

56
57

Methods: We evaluated changes in causes of death among the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS)

58

participants, from 2008 to 2016. We analysed risk factors for all-cause and cause-specific mortality,

59

accounting for changes in treatment, fibrosis stage and use of injectable drugs over time. Mortality

60

ascertainment was completed by linking lost-to-follow-up participants to the Swiss Federal Statistical

61

Office (SFSO) death registry.

62
63

Results: We included 4,700 SCCS participants, of whom 478 died between 2008 and 2016. Linkage to

64

the SFSO death registry substantially improved the information on causes of death (from 42% of deaths

65

with unknown cause to 10% after linkage). Leading causes of death were liver failure (crude death rate

66

4.4/1000 person-years), liver cancer (3.4/1000 p-yrs) and non-liver cancer (2.8/1000 p-yrs), with an

67

increasing proportion of cancer-related deaths over time. Cause-specific analysis showed that persons

68

with sustained virologic response (SVR) were less at risk for liver-related mortality than those never

69

treated or treated unsuccessfully.

70
71

Conclusions: Although the expected decrease in mortality is not yet observable, causes of death

72

among HCV-infected persons evolved over time. With the progressive widening of guidelines for DAA

73

use, liver-related mortality is expected to decline in the future. Continued monitoring of cause-specific

74

mortality will remain important to assess the long-term effect of DAA and to design effective

75

interventions.

Lay summary: Leading causes of death among persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the

77

Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort study evolved over the past years, with an increasing proportion of cancer-

78

related deaths. The positive impact of new potent anti-HCV drugs on mortality among HCV-infected

79

persons is not yet observable, due to both the slow progression of chronic hepatitis C and the

80

progressive relaxation of guidelines for the use of those new drugs.

Background

82

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver-related mortality [1, 2], responsible for about

83

399,000 deaths worldwide in 2016. With the introduction of potent direct-acting antiviral agents

84

(DAA), the risk of morbidity and mortality for HCV infected persons has decreased substantially [3]. It

85

is likely that causes of death are changing over time and with age, since HCV infected people may

86

become increasingly at risk of dying from non-liver-related causes, including non- liver-related

87

malignancies or cardiovascular diseases [4]. However, due to the slow progression of chronic hepatitis

88

C, such trends may be slow to emerge. Some studies predict a rise in liver-related deaths to continue

89

for another decade [5, 6], meanwhile the number of HCV-related deaths are stable or increasing in

90

many settings [7].

91
92

Various studies have analysed mortality among HCV-infected persons. In the United States (US),

93

several studies have shown that HCV-related deaths disproportionally affect persons born between

94

1945 and 1965 [8, 9]. Both a comparison between the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study and the official

95

death certificates in the US [9], and a comparison between the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS)

96

and the death certificates from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFSO) [7] showed that under-

97

reporting of HCV infection on death certificates is quite common. In both the US and Switzerland, HCV-

98

related mortality increased significantly between the late 1990s and the early 2000s, whereas human

99

immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related mortality decreased, and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related

100

mortality remained relatively stable [7, 8]. In New South Wales, Australia, HCV notifications were

101

linked to the death registry [1, 2]. When comparing mortality between HCV-infected persons and the

102

general population, both liver-related and drug-related death rates were about 15-16 times higher in

103

Australians with HCV. In HCV mono-infected persons, liver-related deaths increased considerably with

104

older age, and drug-related death rates were higher in younger age groups [1, 2]. In this population,

105

liver-related mortality remained stable between 1997 and 2006, and drug-related mortality was

106

relatively constant between 2002 and 2006 [1, 2]. More recently, a study based on the US Veterans

107

Affairs Hepatitis C Clinical Case Registry showed that, among HCV-infected patients treated with DAA,

108

successful treatment substantially reduced mortality, both in the presence and absence of advanced

109

liver disease [10, 11].

110
111

Nevertheless, few studies have analysed detailed patterns of cause-specific mortality among HCV-

112

infected persons. We therefore investigated the risk factors and time trends for all-cause and cause-

113

specific mortality among HCV-infected persons in the SCCS. We improved mortality ascertainment by

114

linking patients lost-to-follow-up to death certificates from the SFSO.

Methods

116

The Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS)

117

The SCCS is a prospective observational cohort study, established in 2000, that continuously enrols

118

adult patients aged ≥ 18 years in Switzerland. Only persons who are confirmed anti-HCV antibody-

119

positive are included [12]. Eight centres are involved, including all five university hospitals in

120

Switzerland (Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich), three large non-university hospitals (Lugano,

121

Neuchâtel and St. Gallen) and some affiliated centres. For all persons in the SCCS, various demographic,

122

psychosocial, clinical, laboratory and treatment data were collected via standardized questionnaires.

123

The questionnaires were completed by physicians or study nurses, during enrolment and annual

124

follow-up visits. The study was approved by all local ethics committees, and all persons provided

125

written informed consent. For deceased persons, the cause of death was coded according to the

126

International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) [13].

127

Supplementary information was also provided to specify if the death was related to HCV infection or

128

due to an accident, a suicide or overdose/accidental poisoning.

129
130

Eligibility criteria and definitions

131

We included all persons enrolled before December 31st 2016 (until when data on causes of death were

132

compiled by the SFSO). We excluded those who died before January 1st 2008, because the new 13-digit

133

social security number (SSN), which was needed for the linkage, became available only in 2008.

134

Patients were lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) if they were not seen since August 2015 and not known to have

135

moved abroad or to have died. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was defined as an undetectable HCV

136

RNA ≥ 12 weeks after the end of antiviral treatment.

137
138

Linkage with the SFSO death registry

139

The SFSO has monitored causes of death in Switzerland since 1876. Causes of death are coded by the

140

ICD-10 code based on initial, consecutive and concomitant diseases listed on the SFSO death

141

certificate. To complete the SCCS information on mortality, deceased and LTFU persons in the SCCS

142

were linked to the SFSO death registry, by exact record linkage. The linkage was done for all persons

143

who were declared LTFU or dead in the SCCS between January 1st 2008 and December 31st 2016. We

144

used the 13-digit SSN and the date of birth for the linkage when the SSN was available. If the SSN was

145

not available, the linkage was based on the dates of birth and death.

146
147

Coding and comparing causes of death

148

We classified the main cause of death into mutually exclusive categories (liver cancer, liver failure, non-

149

liver cancer, cardiovascular, unnatural causes, other, unspecified) as described in Table 1. The “other”

150

category includes all deaths with a frequency below 30 persons. Unnatural causes of death include

151

suicide, overdose/accidental poisoning and accident.

152

For each deceased person in the SCCS, we retained one source of information to classify the cause

153

according to the following rules. For persons linked to the death registry, we preferentially selected

154

ICD-10 codes from the SFSO. When this information was not available, or when the SFSO provided less

155

specific information than the SCCS, we used the ICD-10 code from the SCCS. In case no ICD-10 code

156

was available from the SFSO or the SCCS, we used the supplementary information from the SCCS on

157

causes of death mentioned earlier, specifying if the death was physically related to HCV infection, or

158

due to an accident, a suicide or an overdose/accidental poisoning. All the deceased persons who could

159

not be classified following this procedure were defined “unspecified”. Finally, the cause of death

160

classification was reviewed by an expert clinician who corrected misclassifications of complex cases

161

specific to HCV infection.

162

For the deceased persons linked to the SFSO death registry, we compared the main causes of death in

163

the SCCS and the SFSO. We measured the interrater agreement via the Kappa statistics in two ways

164

[14]: first by directly comparing the ICD-10 codes for the main cause of death, and then by using the

165

grouped causes of death using the groups in Table 1.

168

We calculated overall crude mortality rates and for different time periods, for both each cause of death

169

group and all-cause mortality. We also conducted survival analysis, for which follow-up time was

170

calculated from enrolment into the cohort or the starting date of the period of interest (baseline), to

171

the censoring date (which was either the date of death or the last known date of being alive). When

172

the dates of death in the SCCS and SFSO were different, we used the date of the SFSO.

173

We calculated crude cumulative incidences for each cause of death group, accounting for competing

174

risk (where each cause of death was a competing risk for the other causes), using the R mstate package

175

[15]. We then used Cox Proportional Hazard regression, including time-dependent covariables [14, 15],

176

to determine risk factors of mortality. We first analysed all-cause mortality, and then cause-specific

177

mortality, for each of the causes of death (except for “other” and “unspecified”). Analyses were

178

adjusted for sex, baseline age (as a continuous variable with restricted cubic splines [18]), fibrosis score

179

(F1 to F4), history of injection drug use (IDU) (ever, never), and treatment status (never treated, treated

180

with SVR, treated without SVR). For all-cause mortality, we also accounted for the treatment history

181

(never treated, ever treated and received DAA, ever treated but never received DAA). Due to the

182

limited number of deceased patients who received DAA, we could not add this co-variable in the cause-

183

specific analysis. To determine the fibrosis score, we combined the information from liver biopsies,

184

FibroScanTM analyses, and any reported cirrhosis during follow-up. Liver stiffness assessed by

185

FibroScanTM was converted to Metavir scores (F1: <7.5 kPa, F2: ≥ 7.5 to < 9.5 kPa, F3: ≥ 9.5 to < 12.5

186

kPa, and F4: ≥ 12.5 kPa) and reported cirrhosis was translated into a Metavir fibrosis score of 4. We

187

made no assumption on the possible evolution of fibrosis over time, and carried the values forward

188

until the next measurement or until the end of the study. We used multiple imputation by chained

189

equations (R mice package [19]) to impute missing values of time-dependent covariables (see details

190

in Appendix 1).

191

For sensitivity analysis, we recalculated the Cox Proportional Hazard models without multiple

192

imputation, excluding all the persons for whom information on treatment type and outcome, fibrosis

193

score, and history of IDU was incomplete at any time over the period of interest.

Results

195

Linkage SCCS – SFSO death registry

196

A total of 4,700 SCCS participants were followed between January 1st 2008 and December 31st 2016,

197

with 471 of them reported to be deceased. The SSN was available for 66.0% (311 of 471) of persons

198

and in the case where the SSN was not available (30.4% of persons, 143 of 471) the date of death was

199

known. In addition, 245 of the followed persons were LTFU and 87.3% (n=214) of them had a SSN.

200

Overall, 361 of the 471 deceased patients and 7 of the LTFU patients could be linked to the SFSO death

201

registry. Figure 1 summarizes the flow chart of the linkage between the SCCS and the SFSO. Among the

202

linked persons in the SCCS, the reported date of death was identical for 298 persons, was different for

203

54 (for 11 the difference was ± 1 day), and was missing for 16 persons (including the 7 persons LTFU

204

who could be linked).

205
206

Characteristics of persons in the SCCS

207

After linkage between the SCCS and the SFSO death registry, date of death was known for 474 persons

208

and remained unknown for 4 persons. The median duration of follow-up per patient was 6.5 years

209

(IQR: 2.2 - 9.0). During a total of 26,114 person-years (pyrs) of follow-up, the overall mortality rate was

210

18.3/1,000 pyrs (95%CI: 16.7 - 20.0).

211

Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of all the SCCS persons who were included and of deceased

212

persons who could or could not be linked to the death registry. Persons were mostly male (61.7%),

213

Swiss nationals (73.5%), and their median age at start of follow-up was 47.5 years (IQR: 40.6 - 55.1).

214

The majority (54.9%) had a history of IDU, 38.8% had received antiviral treatment, and 17.6% were

215

cirrhotic. Deceased persons who could or could not be linked to the death registry had similar

216

characteristics (Table 2).

219

Of the 368 deceased persons who were linked to the death registry, the main cause of death was

220

available from both the SCCS and the SFSO for 249 persons (67,7%), and for 227 (91,1%) of these 249

221

persons ICD-10 codes were provided in the SCCS. When comparing the causes of death using the ICD-

222

10 codes, the Kappa statistic for interrater agreement was 0.14 (for 40 of 227 cases the codes were

223

identical). If we used the grouped causes of death, the Kappa statistics increased to 0.45 (in 138 of 249

224

cases the causes were identical), demonstrating that the agreement was weak for both approaches.

225
226

Time trends in all-cause and cause-specific mortality among the persons in the SCCS

227

Liver failure was the leading cause of death, with a crude death rate of 4.4/1000 pyrs (95% CI: 3.6 -

228

5.2), followed by liver cancer (3.4/1000 pyrs, CI 2.8 - 4.2), non-liver cancer (2.8/1000 pyrs, CI 2.2 - 3.4),

229

unnatural causes (2.5/1000 p-years, CI 2.0 - 3.1), other causes (2.3/1000 pyrs, CI 1.8 - 2.9), and

230

cardiovascular causes (1.3/1000 pyrs, CI 0.9 - 1.7). For 10% (n = 46) of the 478 deceased persons the

231

main cause of death was unknown.

232
233

Figure 2 shows the evolution of crude mortality rates for all-cause mortality, liver failure and liver

234

cancer mortality over the years. Similar curves for all the considered causes of death can be found in

235

Appendix 2. Before 2014, the leading cause of death was liver failure, followed by liver cancer and non-

236

liver cancer. In contrast, after 2014, when DAA became more widely available in Switzerland, liver

237

cancer became the leading cause of death, followed by liver failure and non-liver cancer.

238
239

Figure 3 shows the cumulative incidence of causes of death over time. The overall probability of dying

240

from any cause increased from 1.5% after one year of follow-up to 13.8% after eight years. While liver

241

failure remained the most common cause of death throughout the follow-up period, liver cancer

242

increased in relative proportion from year 6 onwards.

243
244

Table 3 shows the risk factors for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the SCCS over the period

245

2008-2016.

246

For all-cause mortality, the risk of death was increased for men, older persons, those with a high

247

fibrosis stage and those with a history of IDU. Compared to persons who were never treated, the risk

248

of death was lower for treated persons who reached SVR after receiving interferon (IFN)-based

249

treatment (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.24 - 0.45), and even slightly lower for treated persons who reached SVR

250

after receiving DAA (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 - 0.63). In contrast, treated persons who did not achieve SVR

251

had a comparable risk of death to those who were never treated, irrespective of type of treatment.

252
253

Older persons and those with fibrosis score ≥ F3 were at higher risk of dying from liver failure than

254

younger persons and those with fibrosis score ≤ F2. Baseline treatment status was associated with

255

mortality due to liver failure, with a pronounced protective effect for treated persons with SVR, but no

256

reduction in risk for persons treated without SVR.

257
258

For liver cancer, the risk of death was higher for older persons, as reported previously by other studies

259

[20], and those with a high fibrosis stage. Having a history of IDU had little impact on liver cancer

260

mortality. Compared to never treated persons, the risk of dying decreased for treated persons with

261

SVR, but not for treated persons without SVR.

262
263

The risk of dying from non-liver cancer was higher for older persons than for younger persons.

264

Although there was no significant association between non-liver cancer mortality and treatment

265

status, nor with baseline fibrosis score, persons with a history of IDU were more at risk than persons

266

without a history of IDU.

267
268

Having ever used injectable drugs was associated with an increased risk of dying from unnatural

269

causes. In addition, persons aged 20 years were more at risk than persons aged 40 years or older, as

270

well as persons with a fibrosis score ≥ F3 compared to those with fibrosis score ≤ F2. There was no

271

association between unnatural causes of death and treatment status.

Results from the sensitivity analysis were similar to the main analysis for all-cause mortality, but there

274

were some notable differences for cause-specific mortality (Appendix 3).

Discussion

277

Based on the SCCS data, we investigated time trends and risk factors of all-cause and cause-specific

278

mortality among HCV-infected persons in Switzerland. The linkage of the LTFU persons to the death

279

registry did not significantly increase the number of deaths. However the proportion of unknown

280

causes of death decreased substantially from 42% without linkage to 10% with linkage. The leading

281

causes of death changed over time, with a substantial increase in the proportion of deaths related to

282

liver cancer. Two factors probably explain this change: the risk of dying from liver disease increased as

283

people became older; and ascertainment of cause of death may have improved over time. Indeed, the

284

proportion of unspecified causes of death decreased from 13% in 2008-2013 to 4% in 2014-2016,

285

reflecting the better linkage in the latter years (92% of deceased persons could be linked in 2014-2016,

286

compared to 67% in 2008-2013).

287
288

Similarly to other studies [7], we found that mortality remained stable among HCV-infected persons in

289

Switzerland over the past few years. The expected decrease in mortality due to DAA is therefore not

290

occurring, or more probably not yet observable. The risk of death was lower for women, younger

291

persons, persons with lower fibrosis score, persons without a history of IDU, and treated persons who

292

reached SVR, with a first indication of a more positive effect with DAA compared to IFN-based

293

treatments. However, in contrast to some other studies, we found little evidence that being treated

294

with subsequent treatment failure had a protective effect compared to remaining untreated [19, 20].

295
296

For both liver failure and liver cancer, the risk of dying was significantly associated with treatment,

297

with a lower risk for treated persons with SVR than for treated persons without SVR or for untreated

298

persons. As data for wider use of DAA was only available for three years (2014 - 2016), we were not

299

able to evaluate the difference between successful IFN treatment and successful DAA treatment with

300

respect to liver-related mortality. Furthermore, in the early DAA era, the reimbursement of DAA by

301

health insurances was limited to persons with advanced fibrosis (Metavir stages F3 or F4). By mid-

302

2016, patients with Metavir score F2 were also treated [21, 22]. The limitation based on fibrosis stage

303

was relaxed progressively between July and October 2017, when all patients were treated, although

304

the prescription of DAA remained restricted to specialists.

305
306

Having a history of IDU was an important risk factor for death from non-liver cancer and unnatural

307

causes of death, explained by the inclusion of overdose/accidental poisoning in this category. Persons

308

who inject drugs (PWID) are a key subgroup of HCV-infected persons in Switzerland and other high-

309

income countries, where the majority of HCV infections occurred via injection of drugs [23, 24].

310

Despite the implementation of the four-pillar strategy [27], a national drug policy in Switzerland since

311

1994, additional obstacles exist for HCV treatment among PWID both from treatment providers and

312

from patients [27]. This results in some HCV-infected PWID entered care relatively late, at an advanced

313

fibrosis stage. The proportion of infected PWID who received anti-HCV treatments increased only

314

slightly from 51% in the years 2008-2013 to 58% in the years 2014-2016. The delay in treatment

315

initiation probably decreased, and even PWID who enter care late are more likely to reach favourable

316

outcomes with DAA. However, persons with a history of IDU now have a higher risk of dying from non-

317

liver cancer, potentially related to their addiction and to additional risk factors that are common among

318

PWID, such as smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.

319
320

Differences between causes of death reported in the SFSO death registry and the SCCS can be partly

321

explained by different coding practices. Detailed analysis of the discrepant entries revealed that for

322

19% of cases where the cause of death was coded as “other” in the SCCS, it was coded as “non-liver

323

cancer”, “unnatural cause”, or “cardiovascular disease” in the SFSO. The main focus of the SCCS was

324

likely to identify all HCV-related deaths, and there was less emphasis to record the exact cause of

325

death. For 21% of SCCS entries, cause of death was “liver failure” in one dataset and “liver cancer” in

326

the other, two causes that are relatively similar. Overall, clear discrepancies in the causes of death

327

recorded in the SCCS and the SFSO existed in only 21% of cases (Appendix 4).

329

To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating detailed risk factors and time trends of

330

cause-specific mortality among HCV-infected persons. Due to the linkage with the death registry, we

331

significantly improved information on causes of death. By accounting for competing risks, by including

332

age as a continuous covariate (and not categorizing it arbitrarily), and by adjusting models for time-

333

dependent covariables, we could improve the accuracy of our analysis.

334

A limitation of this study was the unavailability of complete data relating to fibrosis stage evolution.

335

Due to this, we made no assumption on the evolution of fibrosis over time, and used multiple

336

imputation to impute missing values, which may compromise the robustness of our analysis. We did a

337

sensitivity analysis, using complete cases only. In this analysis, the number of persons for the cause-

338

specific analysis was relatively limited and results may therefore be less reliable.

339
340

In conclusion, although mortality did not, or did not yet decrease with DAA, we found that causes of

341

death changed over time. With the wider use of DAA, irrespective of fibrosis stage, it is likely that liver-

342

related mortality will continue to decline in the future. Continuous monitoring of mortality and causes

343

of death will therefore remain important to evaluate the long-term effect of DAA and to develop

344

effective interventions.

Appendix 1: Details on the multiple imputation

477

Because adding variables that are not part of the analysis can improve the imputation, we added the

478

following baseline explanatory variables: body mass index (BMI), HIV co-infection, cirrhotic status,

479

diabetes comorbidity, alcohol consumption (light/no drinker if average consumption ≤ 20g/day,

480

moderate drinker if average consumption between 21 and 40g/day, excessive drinker if average

481

consumption > 40g/day, and former drinker if ever drank more than 40g/day but is now a light or

482

moderate drinker). Furthermore, the outcome was also included in the imputation. We ran the model

483

on 20 imputed datasets for each analysis and combined the estimates with Rubin’s rule.
