Abstract
Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating form of stroke associated
with significant morbidity and mortality. Very little is known about the predictors of poor
outcome and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurological injury following
aSAH. Three molecular pathways have been shown to be important: haemoglobin
metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury. The aim of this review is to use a systematic
approach to identify a panel of key genes within these three pathways in order to focus future
studies investigating predictors of poor outcome and the mechanisms of neurological injury
following aSAH. Manual searching and bioinformatic mining tools were used. Studies of
experimental or human SAH were included, and outcome was broadly defined to include all
encountered readouts such as mortality, neurological scores, and neuropathological markers
of tissue damage. If two or more molecules belonged to the same biochemical pathway, this
pathway was examined in detail to identify all its components, which were then searched
individually for any evidence of association with outcome using the same broad definition as
before. This resulted in the identification of 58 candidate genes within the three pathways of
interest (haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury) potentially linked to
outcome after aSAH.
Introduction
Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage
(aSAH) results from the release of blood
into the subarachnoid space as a
consequence of a cerebral artery
aneurysm rupture. aSAH is associated
with significant morbidity and mortality.
Twenty-eight day mortality rates of up to
42% have been reported1 with the largest
proportion of patients dying within two days
of ictus2. Long term morbidity affecting
survivors is significant with around half of
survivors having cognitive impairments and
only a third returning to the same work as
prior to haemorrhage3. The socioeconomic
burden of aSAH in the UK has been
estimated as £510 million annually4.

as a consequence of a spike in intracranial
pressure and an associated fall in cerebral
blood flow. This initiates toxic cascades
causing global cerebral ischemia, bloodbrain-barrier (BBB) disruption, cerebral
oedema and ultimately cell death5. The
toxic cascades initiated by EBI and the
presence of blood and its breakdown
products in the subarachnoid space are
thought to cause a delayed brain injury
characterised by spreading cortical
depression, loss of autoregulation,
microthrombi, inflammation, oxidative
stress and vasospasm6-8.

Blood within the subarachnoid space is
broken down and cleared in a multi-step
pathway involving a number of scavenging
molecules9. This clearance system within

product scavenging molecules have been
shown to play an important role in
mitigating toxicity and limiting the
neurological injury caused by blood
breakdown products. Several authoritative
reviews9-15
have
concluded
that
haemoglobin metabolism, inflammatory
and oxidative mechanisms play a
significant role in neurological injury
following SAH (Figure 1).
The aim of this review is to identify a panel
of molecules within the three themes of
haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation
and oxidative stress, which are of potential
prognostic value after human aSAH.
Candidate molecules were identified by an
exhaustive search of the literature, using a
combination of manual and text-mining
methodology.
The candidate molecules identified here
will be of use to any investigator who plans
to perform a targeted study of the three
pathways and outcome after SAH, using
genetic, proteomic or metabolomic
methods. As an example, in our case, we
plan to perform a gene exome sequencing
study, during which the exons and
upstream regions of the candidates will be
sequenced; the association of genetic
variation in these regions with clinical
outcome after aSAH will be investigated.
Further study of these pathways will: (1)
provide further evidence of the importance
of haemoglobin breakdown product
metabolism, inflammation and oxidative
stress after human SAH; (2) improve
prognostic tools; (3) give insight into the
mechanisms
of
neurological
injury
following aSAH; (4) identify therapeutic
targets for aSAH.
Methods
Rationale
A combination of manual and semiautomated methodology was used, rather
than fully automated methods. In order to
illustrate the need for this combined
approach, we give an example. In mouse
and rat models of SAH, two studies16,17
compared RNA expression in cortical
tissue from SAH versus control animals,

and found that inflammation is a key theme.
Blood breakdown products and oxidative
stress
are
intricately
linked
to
18-23
inflammation
, yet these molecules are
less likely to feature in automated pathway
or network analyses of unbiased proteomic
and RNA expression datasets since they
are not well described in terms of KEGG
pathways and GO ontology terms, and their
networks are composed of a small number
of molecules. For instance, when the 324
genes identified to be related to SAH by
GLAD4U24 (a PubMed gene retrieval and
prioritization tool) are run through OverRepresentation Analysis (ORA), Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Network
Topology-based
Analysis
(NTA)
bioinformatic pipelines, oxidative stress
and blood breakdown product metabolism
are not identified. Hence enrichment of
potential
candidates
within
these
pathways, based on most likely biologic
targets reported in the literature, is needed
to study components of these pathways
which have been shown to be important in
determining outcome after experimental or
human SAH.
Overview
A literature search was performed for
molecules shown to be important in
influencing outcome after experimental or
human aSAH within the three themes of
haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation
and oxidative stress. Outcome was broadly
defined and included all encountered
readouts such as mortality, neurological
scores, and neuropathological markers of
tissue damage.
The search strategy consisted of a manual
Pubmed search specifically addressing the
three themes of haemoglobin metabolism,
inflammation
and
oxidative
stress,
supplemented by the full-text literature
mining gene retrieval and functional
analysis
tool
SciMiner25
(http://hurlab.med.und.edu/SciMiner/).
Publications retrieved were manually
screened to ensure that the molecule was
positively associated with outcome after
SAH. For the reasons explained under
“Rationale”, a combination of literature and
pathway analysis was used in a sequential

multi-stage process, which is described
next.
Description of stages
The stages of this search are depicted
graphically in Figure 2. First, a primary
literature search was performed in order to
identify molecules (referred to as ‘Group A’
molecules) relevant to SAH from the three
key themes: blood breakdown product
metabolism, inflammation and oxidation.
PubMed was searched for articles
published in English prior to January 2019
using the following criteria: “oxidation”,
“anti-oxidant”,
“oxidative”,
“redox”,
“inflammation”,
“inflammatory”,
“h(a)emoglobin”, “haem/heme” and “iron”
in single combination with “subarachnoid
h(a)emorrhage”. The reference lists of
published articles were manually searched
for further articles. The results were
manually curated to select those molecules
related to SAH outcome.
If two or more molecules identified during
the primary search belonged to the same
biochemical pathway, this pathway was
examined using different pathway analysis
tools to identify all its components: the
Reactome pathway database26, KEGG
pathway repository27, textbooks and the
literature. The genes identified by this
search that were not present in ‘Group A’
are referred to as the ‘Group B’ molecules.
In order to ensure that none of these
‘Group B’ molecules were overlooked in the
primary search, a secondary PubMed
search was undertaken. In the secondary
search the ‘Group B’ molecules were
individually searched in combination with
“subarachnoid h(a)emorrhage”. Genes of
this molecules were searched using official
symbol provided by HGNC28 and any
common alternatives. ‘Group B’ molecules
identified in the literature review to have
evidence of a role in SAH outcome are
referred to as ‘Group C’ molecules. ‘Group
D’
molecules
represent
a
more
comprehensive set of molecules of interest
in SAH outcome (‘Group A’ + ‘Group C’).
See Figure 2 for a summary of
methodology and molecule groups A-D.

To ensure no molecules were missed,
Pubmed IDs from both primary and
secondary searches were text-mined using
the full-text literature mining gene retrieval
and functional analysis tool SciMiner25
(http://hurlab.med.und.edu/SciMiner/).
Genes which had not been identified
manually were traced back to the original
publication to identify whether they were
associated with outcome after human or
experimental SAH.
Results
As of 3rd August 2019, 1554 publications
were retrieved by the primary Pubmed
search. Automated text mining of these
publications on SciMiner yielded 295
genes. Manual curation of the publications
linked to these genes yielded 43 Group A
molecules. A further 15 Group C molecules
were identified during the secondary
Pubmed search (Figure 2).
The final group of molecules (n=58)
relevant to outcome after SAH (Group D =
A + C) are shown in Table 1. Table 3
provides further detail on the function of
each Group D molecule.
Conclusion
Blood breakdown product metabolism
along with inflammatory and oxidative
pathways play an important role after SAH.
Experimental manipulation and/or genetic
variation of molecules in these pathways
have been linked to outcome after SAH and
they therefore represent a very attractive
target for future research studies. Further
investigation of these molecules may help
inform the mechanisms underlying poor
outcome and help develop treatments to
mitigate the devastating complications of
SAH. It is important to note that these
pathways are not independent but
intimately linked. Both inflammation and
oxidative stress can activate the other
pathway, and transcription factors such as
Nrf2, PPARg and NFkB influence both
pathways23,29. Blood breakdown products
can stimulate both inflammation and
oxidative stress and their scavengers play
an important role to mitigate toxicity by
clearing the breakdown products18,22,30-32.
