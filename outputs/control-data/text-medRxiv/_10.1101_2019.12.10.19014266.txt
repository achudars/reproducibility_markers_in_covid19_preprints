ABSTRACT
Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of the most commonly
performed sports medicine procedures. A variety of grafts are currently used for reconstruction,
including both allograft and autograft. Despite numerous meta-analyses, there exists no highquality quantitative synthesis of all randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on graft choice.
Objective: To identify the optimal graft choice for ACL reconstruction by performing the first
systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to include both functional outcomes and
complications.
Methods: Multiple digital databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL will be
searched independently and in duplicate for RCTs randomizing graft choice in ACL reconstruction
in skeletally mature patients. A Bayesian framework with a random-effects model will be used for
NMA. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values will be used to generate a
rank list for each outcome. Results will be reported as mean differences (MD) (or standardized
mean difference, if necessary) or relative risk (RR) with 95% credible intervals (CI). Comparisons
will be inferred to be statistically significant if the 95% CI of MD does not cross zero or if the 95%
CI of relative risk does not cross one. Studies will be assessed for quality using the Cochrane risk
of bias assessment tool. Quality of evidence for each network comparison will be determined as
per the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
approach for network meta-analyses. This NMA will be reported according to the PRISMA
extension statement for network meta-analyses
Outcomes of interest: Functional outcomes of interest including range of motion, return to
activity/sport, and IKDC, Lysholm, Tegner, ACL-QOL, and KOOS scores. Persistent laxity as
measured by Lachman, Pivot-shift, side-to-side, and measured laxity (e.g. KT-1000) will also be
analyzed. Complications (e.g. infection, graft failure, donor site pain), tunnel osteolysis, and failure
(including but not limited to graft rupture and/or persistent laxity) will be compared between grafts.
Relevance/Impact: This NMA will be the first high-quality syntheses of all randomized evidence
regarding graft choice in ACL reconstruction. As the first analysis to compare all major graft
choices independently, it will be used to inform surgeon-patient decision making. It has the
reasonable possibility of changing clinical practice.

Introduction
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of the most commonly performed sports
medicine procedures and the incidence of this procedure continues to increase.1,2 A variety of
grafts have been used for reconstruction, including both allograft and autograft.3,4 Commonly used
graft choices include bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft (BPTB), hamstrings autograft (HT),
quadriceps tendon autograft (QT), and tibial tendon allograft (TT), while hybrid grafts—autograft
augmented with allograft—have received recent attention.2,3,5 Each graft is associated with a
unique functional and complication profile, often leaving surgeons and patients with the task of
choosing grafts on an individualized basis.4 In fact, modern graft preference has remained fairly
consistent with the exception of QT, which has seen a recent increase.3,5 Despite numerous metaanalyses and large prospective knee ligament registries, there is no clearly preferred graft,
demonstrated by the frequent use of numerous different grafts.3
Currently, there is no high-quality quantitative synthesis of all randomized controlled trial
(RCT) data on graft choice. Conventional meta-analyses are limited to comparison of two groups,
necessitating either exclusion of commonly used grafts or grouping of different graft types.
Network meta-analysis (NMA) generates multiple simultaneous comparisons utilizing both direct
and indirect evidence.6,7 Accordingly, the objective of this study is to identify the optimal graft
choice for ACL reconstruction by performing the first systematic review and NMA to include both
functional outcomes and complications.
Methods
This systematic review and network meta-analysis will be performed according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) for network metaanalyses8,9 and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.10 A PRISMA
checklist for the reporting of network meta-analyses will be included as a supplementary material
in the final publication.
Literature search
A comprehensive literature search will be conducted using the following databases: Medline,
Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),
Cochrane Library, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and
ClinicalTrials.gov. This search will be limited to randomized controlled trials and will be conducted
without language restrictions. An example search strategy for MEDLINE is provided in Table 2.
The database search will be supplemented by manually screening of references from included
articles and previous systematic reviews.
Screening
Articles will be screened by two investigators, independently and in duplicate. Disagreements
between reviewers will be resolved by consensus, and if necessary, consultation with a senior
reviewer. For studies published more than once, only the article with the most complete data will
be included. For articles published in a non-English language, a medical translator fluent in the
language of the study will translate and assist with article screening if possible.

biomechanical cadaver studies, review articles, letters, basic science studies, correspondences
or comments. Trials examining revision reconstruction or those including skeletally immature
patients will be excluded.
Data Extraction
Articles produced from the literature search will be downloaded as complete reference files. Two
reviewers will independently extract data in parallel from all included articles into a piloted,
standard extraction document (Microsoft Excel 16.2, Redmond, United States) designed a priori.
Article authors will be contacted in instances where additional information or clarity is required.
The following study details will be extracted: year of publication, study design, recruitment period,
country of recruitment, trial funder, role of trial funder, number of patients, number of knees,
patient age, sex, and activity level, graft fixation method, concurrent procedures at the time of
ACL reconstruction, post-operative protocol, and follow-up duration.
Outcomes of Interest
Outcomes of interest include range of motion, return to activity/sport, subjective and objective

infection, graft failure, donor site pain), tunnel osteolysis, and failure (including but not limited to
graft rupture and/or persistent laxity).
If range of motion is reported only as a percentage of the uninjured knee, a degree
measurement will be calculated using published normal values.17,18 Means and standard
deviations (SDs) will be collected; medians will be used in lieu of means if mean values are not
reported.19 If a 95% confidence interval was reported as the measure of variability, standard
deviation will be approximated.20 When no measure of variance is reported, standard deviation

will be imputed using a p value (if reported exactly) or a weighted average of variances observed
in other included studies.20,21
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.4.2 (Open Access Online) with BUGSnet (Lighthouse
Outcomes, Toronto, Canada) and CINeMA.22 Heterogeneity between studies will be calculated
using the I2 statistic; if heterogeneity is high, a Bayesian framework with a random-effects model
and non-informative priors will be used. A graphical framework of all trials comparing different
interventions will be created for each outcome. Ranking diagrams and forest plots will also be
created for each outcome. Furthermore, surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA)
values will be reported for each study. The SURCRA score represents the likelihood that a given
treatment will rank first in a specific category; a score closer to one indicates that treatment is
more likely to represent the best treatment. Treatment rank orders will be generated and
presented using SUCRA values. Incoherence—inconsistency between direct and indirect
evidence—will be assessed globally using the design-by-treatment interaction test and
individually using the Separating Indirect from Direct Evidence (SIDE) and node-splitting
methods.23,24 If appropriate, a nested analysis will be conducted; the first level of analysis will
compare autograft to allograft while the second level of analysis will look at each graft
independently.
Results of the network for functional outcomes will be reported as mean differences (MD)
(or standardized mean difference, if necessary) with 95% credible intervals (CI). Complications
will be presented using relative risk (RR), 95% credible intervals, and number needed to treat, as
appropriate. Credible intervals are derived using the posterior distribution of the outcome in
question and can be thought of as the Bayesian equivalent of confidence intervals. Comparisons
will be inferred as statistically significant if the 95% CI of MD does not cross zero or if the 95% CI
of relative risk does not cross one.
Quality Assessment
The quality of each included study will be evaluated in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias
tool, while the Cochrane CINeMA tool, designed around the GRADE framework, will be used for
risk of bias assessment specific to outcomes from network meta-analyses.22,25 Included RCTs will
be assessed for quality by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment
tool.26 Disagreement will be resolved through consultation with a third reviewer. Overall quality of
evidence for each network comparison will be determined and ranked based on within-study bias,
reporting bias, indirectness, imprecision, heterogeneity, and incoherence, as per the Grades of
Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for network
meta-analyses.25,27

including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.
State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility,
included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the
meta-analysis).
Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted
forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for
obtaining and confirming data from investigators.
List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g.,
PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and
simplifications made.
Describe methods used to explore the geometry of the
treatment network under study and potential biases related to it.
This should include how the evidence base has been
graphically summarized for presentation, and what

characteristics were compiled and used to describe the
evidence base to readers.
Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual
studies (including specification of whether this was done at the
study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used
in any data synthesis.
State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio,
difference in means). Also describe the use of additional
summary measures assessed, such as treatment rankings and
surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values, as
well as modified approaches used to present summary findings
from meta-analyses.
Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of
studies for each network meta-analysis. This should include, but
not be limited to:
 Handling of multi-arm trials;
 Selection of variance structure;
 Selection of prior distributions in Bayesian analyses;
and
Describe the statistical methods used to evaluate the
agreement of direct and indirect evidence in the treatment
network(s) studied. Describe efforts taken to address its
presence when found.
Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the
cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting
within studies).
Describe methods of additional analyses if done, indicating
which were pre-specified. This may include, but not be limited
to, the following:
 Sensitivity or subgroup analyses;
 Meta-regression analyses;
 Alternative formulations of the treatment network; and
Use of alternative prior distributions for Bayesian analyses (if
applicable).
Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and
included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each
stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
Provide a network graph of the included studies to enable
visualization of the geometry of the treatment network.
Provide a brief overview of characteristics of the treatment
network. This may include commentary on the abundance of
trials and randomized patients for the different interventions and
pairwise comparisons in the network, gaps of evidence in the
treatment network, and potential biases reflected by the network
structure.
For each study, present characteristics for which data were
extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and
provide the citations.
Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any
outcome level assessment.

For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for
each study: 1) simple summary data for each intervention
group, and 2) effect estimates and confidence intervals.
Modified approaches may be needed to deal with information
from larger networks.
Present results of each meta-analysis done, including
confidence/credible intervals. In larger networks, authors may
focus on comparisons versus a particular comparator (e.g.
placebo or standard care), with full findings presented in an
appendix. League tables and forest plots may be considered to
summarize pairwise comparisons. If additional summary
measures were explored (such as treatment rankings), these
should also be presented.
Describe results from investigations of inconsistency. This may
include such information as measures of model fit to compare
consistency and inconsistency models, P values from statistical
tests, or summary of inconsistency estimates from different
parts of the treatment network.
Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies
for the evidence base being studied.

Summarize the main findings, including the strength of evidence
for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups
(e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy-makers).
Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of
bias), and at review level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified
research, reporting bias). Comment on the validity of the
assumptions, such as transitivity and consistency. Comment on
any concerns regarding network geometry (e.g., avoidance of
certain comparisons).
Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of
other evidence, and implications for future research.
Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other
support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic
review. This should also include information regarding whether
funding has been received from manufacturers of treatments in
the network and/or whether some of the authors are content
experts with professional conflicts of interest that could affect
use of treatments in the network.
