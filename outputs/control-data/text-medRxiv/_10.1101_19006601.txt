Abstract

Objective
Recent studies regarding the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) for treating traumatic brain injury (TBI)
have been inconsistent. This study conducts a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to
assess the safety and efficacy of EPO for TBI patients at various follow-up time points.

Methods
A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar
and the Cochrane Library for RCTs studying EPO in TBI patients published through March 2019.
Non-English manuscripts and non-human studies were excluded. The assessed outcomes include
mortality, neurological recovery and associated adverse effects. Dichotomous variables are presented
as risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results
A total of seven RCTs involving 1197 TBI patients were included in this study. Compared to the placebo
arm, treatment with EPO did not improve acute hospital mortality or short-term mortality. However,
there was a significant improvement in mid-term (6 months) follow-up survival rates. EPO
administration was not associated with neurological function improvement. Regarding adverse effects,
EPO treatment did not increase the incidence of thromboembolic events or other associated adverse
events.

Conclusions
This meta-analysis indicates a slight mortality benefit for TBI patients treated with EPO at mid-term
follow-up. EPO does not improve in-hospital mortality, nor does it increase adverse events including
thrombotic, cardiovascular and other associated complications. Our analysis did not demonstrate a
significant beneficial effect of EPO intervention on the recovery of neurological function. Future RCTs
are required to further characterize the use of EPO in TBI.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and lifelong disability around the world, and

1

predominantly affects younger and middle-aged people . The United States Center for Disease Control
estimates that TBI results in more than 280,000 hospitalizations and 2.2 million emergency

2

department visits, and contributes to the deaths of over 52,000 people annually . As the direct and

3

indirect health-care costs of TBI are estimated at more than $76.5 billion , TBI is a pressing medical
and public health problem.
The mechanisms of TBI are typically divided into "primary" and “secondary ” injury. Primary injury

4

refers to the direct trauma to the brain, while secondary injury

refers to the sequelae, which consists

of a complex set of cellular and molecular processes inducing destruction of mitochondrial integrity,
progressive neuronal loss through necrosis and apoptosis, accumulation of lactate, and cytotoxic
swelling of cells. They will reduce cerebral perfusion by causing brain edema and an increase in
intracranial pressure. These deteriorations can occur for days, weeks and even months following the

5

initial trauma, resulting in delayed tissue damage .
Over the past few decades, our understanding of the dynamic TBI pathophysiology has improved

6

significantly . More than 100 compounds are currently being investigated in preclinical studies for the
treatment of secondary injury. However,

almost all Phase II/III TBI clinical trials have failed

7

.

Erythropoietin (EPO), a hemopoietin growth factor with neurocytoprotective effects from the type 1
cytokine superfamily, has been proved to be a promising neuroprotective therapeutic agent in a

8

variety of neurological injuries including TBI . In experimental models, EPO has been proved to
stimulates hematopoiesis, and possess neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects through

9

reduction of apoptosis, relieve inflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity . A meta-analysis
about the effect of EPO in experimental TBI in animal models concluded that EPO could reduce the
lesion volume and improve neurobehavioral outcomes, which might be beneficial in treating
experimental animal modes of TBI

10

. However, EPO’s mechanism of action was only partially

understood through laboratory experiments, and the potential benefits and possible risks of EPO for
TBI patients still need investigation. Pharmaceutical therapy with net clinical benefit had been
lacking

11

12

. Clinical evidence of the EPO therapy quickly evolved but conveyed conflicting results

13

One prior systematic review on EPO for TBI by Liu et al. (2016)

.

suggests that EPO reduces overall

mortality and shortens hospitalization time without increasing the risk of DVT, but does not improve
favorable neurological outcomes. While this study represents an important first step in interpreting
the EPO for TBI literature, its investigation would have been strengthened by the inclusion of
additional pertinent RCTs, analyses of multiple follow-up periods, and analysis of additional outcome
measures.
Therefore, the current meta-analysis of RCTs aims to analyze a broader set of outcomes and adverse
events and to validate the efficacy, functional outcomes, and safety of EPO treatment for TBI patients.

Materials and Methods
We followed the guidelines proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration in the

Systematic Reviews of Interventions

Cochrane Handbook for

( http://www.cochrane-handbook.org) and the recommended

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to report

14

Search strategy
We conducted a systematic literature search (on March 1, 2019) of PubMed, EMBASE and the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs evaluating the efficacy or safety of EPO for TBI.
We also searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of
key retrieved articles and relevant reviews for additional published and unpublished data. We further
checked the search engine “Google” for abstracts, conference proceedings, or unpublished studies.
We used a combination of keywords and exploded medical subject headings (MeSH) including “EPO”,
“erythropoietin” and “TBI”, “traumatic brain injur*”, “brain injur*”, “head injur*”. Another search
using the same strategy was conducted on April 10, 2019, to identify additional publications.

Inclusion criteria
We included RCTs if they met the following criteria: (1) Population: patients with a diagnosis of TBI; (2)
Intervention: received intravenous or subcutaneous injection of EPO; (3) Comparison: placebo with no
treatment; (4) Outcome measures: the primary outcome was mortality rate (while inpatient, and at
short- and mid-term follow-ups defined as 10 weeks to 3 months follow-up and 6 months follow-up
respectively), the second outcome was favorable neurological outcome (defined as the proportion of
patients who achieved a GOS score of 4 or GOS-E score of 5). Regarding treatment safety, we
examined postoperative complications including incidence of any thromboembolic events (including
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction), and other
associated adverse events (including pneumonia, sepsis, seizure, gastrointestinal complications and
incidence of RBC transfusion).

Study selection
Two authors (intials and initials) independently removed the duplicate records and screened all titles
and abstracts to identify potentially eligible studies. The full text of these potentially eligible studies
were then obtained to further confirm the eligibility of the study for the meta-analysis. Any
disagreements regarding eligibility were arbitrated by consensus with the help of a third reviewer
(initials).

Data extraction
The two authors independently extracted data from included trials, using a standard abstraction form
of excel sheet. From each study we extracted the following items: the first author, year of publication,
country where the study was done, study design, number of participants, sex, age, number of cases,
clinical settings, intervention, time from intervention to treatment, and comparison arm. When the
raw data were not available in the publications, we searched the supplemental attachments or
contacted the authors of the original reports. All data extraction in duplicate numbers were excluded
and discrepancies between the two reviewers were discussed until agreement was reached.

Quality assessment
Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias in each of the included studies without being
blinded to the authors, institutions, or manuscript journals. The eligible studies were evaluated using
the Cochrane Collaboration’s Tool and according to the predefined checklist of the Cochrane Database

15

of Systematic Reviews

. This checklist assesses the risk of bias in random sequence generation,

allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment,

completeness of outcome data, degree of selective reporting, as well as other biases. Any
discrepancies between the two reviewers were solved by consensus or involvement of the other
reviewers.

Statistical analysis
For dichotomous and continuous outcomes, the differences between the experimental and control
arms were quantified as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with

P

values and 95% confidence

intervals (CIs). To assess the presence of heterogeneity, we used a formal Cochran Q test and
quantified with the

I2

16

statistic

. We considered heterogeneity to be mild if the

used fixed-effects meta-analyses to combine results when

I

2

I2

value was ≤ 50%. We

≤ 50%. Otherwise, we applied a

random-effects model. Potential for publication bias was assessed with the funnel plot and Egger

17

regression test

. All statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager Software (RevMan

version 5.3; Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration) and Stata Statistical Software (Stata 14.0,
Stata Corp, College Station, Texas).

Results

Study selection and characteristics
The PRISMA statement flowchart (Figure 1) shows the detailed process of literature screening, study
selection, and reasons for exclusion. Ultimately, 1197 TBI patients (611 treated with EPO, 586 treated
with placebo) from seven RCTs were included in this meta-analysis.

Discussion
Principal findings
This meta-analysis demonstrates a survival benefit at 6 months follow-up to the administration of EPO
to TBI patients. However, EPO intervention did not impact acute hospital mortality (in 10 weeks) or
short-term mortality (10 weeks to 3 months). EPO therapy does not increase adverse events including
thrombotic and cardiovascular complications. At the same time, EPO intervention had no significantly
effect on the recovery of neurological function.

Mortality
This current study of EPO treatment in TBI patients provides a novel analysis of survival rates at
different follow-up times. The study was well-powered enough to detect a slight but significant
six-month survival benefit with EPO treatment. While the concrete mechanism of mortality reduction
in patients with TBI remains unclear, studies suggest that short-term mortality is related to either
brain death or treatment withdrawal due to a perceived poor prognosis, whereas long-term mortality

13

is believed to be mainly due to infection and multi-organ failure.

Our results may suggest the TBI

patients may benefit from EPO treatment for its long-term effect, which may relate to its

25

organ-protective effects

.

Neurological recovery
Preclinical laboratory studies suggest that EPO may decrease local tissue hypoxia in the brain,
improve function of the blood-brain barrier, decrease cerebral edema, and attenuate secondary brain

26

injury, making EPO theoretically well suited to treat TBI.

However, our meta-analysis demonstrated

no significant neurologic improvement in TBI patients following EPO treatment. This is concordant
with Liu et al’s conclusion

13

. Furthermore, our study further demonstrated that no difference at each

subgroup level of GOS and GOS-E systems(RR = 1.22, 95%CI [0.82–1.81];

13

P

= 0.33)..

The value of laboratory experiments for predicting the effectiveness of treatment strategies in clinical
trials remains controversial. Several factors may contribute to the unguaranteed benefits in human
trials compared with EPO being used in animal models. First, the characteristics of the experimental

27

TBI tend to be simple and replicate only single factors in laboratory models

. In contrast, TBI in

humans can result from a variety of etiologies such as the neglect of motorists, cyclists, construction
workers and industrial workers in observing safety precautions, resulting in heterogeneous damage
patterns including cranial fractures, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, cerebral edema,

28

and soft-tissue injuries

. Second, there are differences between rodent and human systemic

physiological and behavioral responses to neurotrauma, which may lead to different rates of survival
as well as differences in neurological recovery

29

.

A broad spectrum of secondary events, complex cascade of molecular and cellular events is triggered
by the initial injury. This all contribute to cell death and/or degeneration and worsen patient
neurological outcomes but could, at least theoretically, be counteracted.

52

To preserve and restore

the integrity, function, and connectivity of the brain cells and improve the patient’s outcome,
neuroprotective drugs should be administered as soon as possible and as long as the pathological

30

cascades occur.

An experimental study in mice suggested the importance of the therapeutic

31

time-window within 6 hours after the initial TBI
early as 5 minutes after injury

. In laboratory studies, EPO can be administered as

32

. While this short time to intervention is not always possible in the

clinical setting, these studies suggest that TBI protocols should incorporate early recognition and
diagnosis, and timely intervention. However , the dose and timing of EPO injections varied greatly
across RCTs, and the current evidence is not strong enough to draw the conclusion that early

33

intervention delivers better prognosis.

Complication
The EPO dose and therapeutic duration were not to reach a consensus, maybe due to the safety
concerns of EPO has not been well established. Most of the evidence regarding the safety of EPO
comes from its non-neurologic use; previous studies reported increased thromboembolic
complications and/or mortality risks with EPO administration to cancer patients, critically-ill patients

34

and patients with kidney disease

. One prior study administered EPO to acute ischemic stroke

patients, which showed that EPO therapy significantly improved long-term neurological outcomes in
patients after ischemic stroke, but the long-term recurrent stroke and mortality rate did not differ
between the EPO-treated and placebo-control group.

Our finding suggests that use of EPO in TBI patients is safe and well-tolerated. However, the
interactions between EPO and various physiologic variables as well as drugs commonly used in TBI
patients are unknown. Future studies should further investigate the safety profile of EPO for TBI,
especially when other commonly-used drugs involving in.

Limitations and weakness
There are a number of limitations often inherent to meta-analyses that we encountered. First, the EPO
treatment regimes differed across studies. The heterogeneity of the original RCTs may have reduced
our ability to discern the true differences between the intervention and control arms. Second, the

14

six-month mid-term follow-up time point is still a relatively brief time-window. Our analysis was
limited by the varying follow-up durations of the included RCTs; further studies should conduct
longer-term follow-up to continue coursing the efficacy and safety of EPO treatment for TBI. Finally,
there are limited published data evaluating EPO treatment for TBI, publication bias was strongly
suspected even though not detected.

Future aim
Further exploration of molecular biomarkers should be anticipated to indicate the appropriate
patients for EPO therapy after TBI

35

. Foundation of new appraisal system to assess the clinical effect is

in demand, as with the originators of the GOS and GOS-E, survival is “an imperfect yardstick” in TBI.
The current study did not demonstrate differences in neurologic recovery using the GOS and GOSE,
but these scales are quite coarse and future studies should further investigate EPO as a
neuroprotective intervention in TBI using more sensitive indicator suggested to detect the realistic
slight, but still clinically meaningful, functional improvement. The time– and dose–response
relationships of EPO treatment in TBI patients also needs to be better delineated. These aims can be
accomplished with better homogenization of included patients, investigation of multiple dosages,
standardization of intervention time, coupled with integrated multidimensional outcomes.

Conclusions
This meta-analysis highlights the potential mid-term survival benefit of EPO treatment for TBI without
increasing the risk of adverse events. However, further well-designed investigations of the effect of
EPO in TBI patients are warranted to guide management.

Figure 1. PRISMA flow diagram summarizing search strategy and selection of RCTs for the
meta-analysis. RCT = randomized controlled trial.
Figure 2. Risk of bias. Upper row: Each risk of bias metric for each included study. Lower row: Review
authors’ judgements about each ‘Risk of bias’ item presented as percentages across all included
studies. The overall risk of bias is relatively low. “+” indicates yes; “-” indicates no; “?” indicates not
clear.
Figure 3 Effect of EPO intervention on mortality compared with control treatment at varying lengths of
follow-up. Results are shown using a fixed-effect model with Risk ratio and 95% CIs. CI, confidence
interval; M-H, Mantel-Haenszel.
Figure 4 Effect of EPO intervention on neurological function recovery compared with control
treatment for different levels according to GOS or GOS-E system at mid-term follow-up period. Results
are shown by using a Random-effect model with Risk ratio and 95% CIs. CI, confidence interval; M-H,
Mantel-Haenszel.
Figure 5 The thromboembolic adverse events of EPO intervention compared with control treatment at
the end of follow-up period. Results are shown by using a Random-effect model with Risk ratio and
95% CIs. CI, confidence interval; M-H, Mantel-Haenszel.
Figure 6 Other associated adverse events of EPO intervention compared with control treatment at the
end of follow-up period. Results are shown by using a Random-effect model with Risk ratio and 95%
CIs. CI, confidence interval; M-H, Mantel-Haenszel.
Figure 7. Funnel plot for the detection of publication bias. The funnel plot of pooled studies that
evaluated the effects of EPO on mortality appears to be symmetrical.
