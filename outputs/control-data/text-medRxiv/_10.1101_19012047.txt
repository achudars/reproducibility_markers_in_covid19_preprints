Abstract
Background: Self-medication is defined as the use of drugs to treat selfdiagnosed symptoms without the supervision of healthcare physicians.
Self-medication is a growing public health phenomenon and is
associated with risks such as misdiagnosis and drug toxicity. This study
aimed to identify the patterns associated with the practice of selfmedication among university students in San José, Costa Rica.

Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed and
conducted to identify variables associated. Information was collected on
the conditions treated, medications used and their sources.

Results: The study found that self-medication is highly prevalent among
Costa Rican university students. 91.4% of the sample reported selfmedicating, with each student consuming an average of 2.15, ± 1,08
drugs. The most Frequently used active ingredients were paracetamol
and Ibuprofen. Results also show a relation between the most consumed
types of drugs and the principal causes of drug intoxication reported by
Costa Rica’s National Poison Center. 77.8% of the participants
considered self-medication a risky practice.

Conclusions: Self-medication is common among Costa Rican university
students. The prevalence found is higher than that reported in previous
studies conducted in the country. These findings suggest the need to
implement prevention campaigns and regulatory policies to ensure the
safe consumption of medical drugs.

Background
The World Health Organization defines self-medication as the use of drugs
to treat self-diagnosed disorders or symptoms, or the intermittent or
continued use of a prescribed drug for chronic or recurrent diseases or
symptoms without the supervision of a medical physician (1). Selfmedication is an important public health phenomenon; which may delay
diagnosis and facilitate the emergence of resistant diseases and
microorganisms, affecting quality of life and global health as a whole (2).

Previous studies have shown that self-medication is associated with risks
such as excessive drug dosage and use, drug interactions and
polypharmacy, incorrect self-diagnosis and misdiagnosis, poor adherence
and delay in medical treatment (2,3). Nonetheless, responsible selfmedication has also shown multiple benefits, including a reduction of the
burden of health services, economic improvement, a reduction of waiting
lists and an increase in patients' active role in their health (3).

In Costa Rica, there are about 180 drugs sold over-the-counter in
supermarkets, pharmacies and other establishments (4). Self-medication
is a practice commonly carried out by the Costa Rican population. Past
studies show that 81% of the population actively self-medicates (4). In
most cases, individuals start self-medicating as teenagers and young

adults (5). Almost half of the population that practices self-medication
has reported the easy identification of the symptoms and pathologies
treated as one of the main reasons for doing so. (4, 5).

Although self-medication is an alarming phenomenon and studies have
been conducted to measure its prevalence in the country (4,5), there are
no recent studies that focus on measuring the prevalence of selfmedication among Costa Rican university students. Studies conducted in
the university population of different countries show that the prevalence
of self-medication is higher in university students than that in the rest of
the population (6, 7).

Having up-to-date evidence-based data on drug consumption patterns is
essential for the implementation of policies and regulatory strategies that
promote rational drug use (8). The objective of this study is to identify
the prevalence and patterns associated with the practice of selfmedication among university students in San José, Costa Rica.

Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2019
and August 2019 with students from a university located in San Jose,
Costa Rica. Participants were selected by random selection and had to
be enrolled in a university to be eligible for the study.
To estimate the prevalence and self-medication patterns in the
population, a 10-question questionnaire was designed based on previous
studies of a similar approach (8) (11) and reviewed by three public health
professionals. A pilot study was conducted in June 2019 with 20 students
from all fields to test the instrument and assess its understanding and
effectiveness. The questionnaire was adjusted as per feedback from the
piloted sample, and data of the pilot study was not included in the results.

use, forms of acquisition, sources of advice, frequent symptoms
prompting self-medication and pharmacological drugs used. Prior to
answering the questionnaire, all participants were given a brief
explanation of the intention of the study and gave their informed consent.

To calculate the sample size, a 95% confidence interval and 0.05
significance level were used. The calculated sample size was increased to

15% to compensate for possible losses and memory bias, thus obtaining
an adjusted sample size of 157.
Descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean, and standard deviation
were used to present participants and their characteristics. Data analysis
was carried out using the SPSS software version 25.0 at a level of
significance of P<0.05.

Results
A total of 139 students answered the questionnaire correctly and were
included in the data analysis. Of the 139 students included in the study,
56.5% were female and 70% did not work in any company or business of
their own. 49.6% of the students were aged between 21-25 years old,
while 39.6% were aged between 16 and 20 years old. Only 10.6% of the
sample were between 26 and 30 years of age.

The university where the sample was collected has 5 faculties: Faculty of
Health Sciences, Faculty of Engineering and ICT, Faculty of Business
Sciences, Faculty of Social Sciences and Faculty of Art and Design. 36.7%
of the participants were students of the Faculty of Health Sciences, while
34.5% studied in the Faculty of Engineering and ICT. 12.9% and 11.5%
of the sample were students of the Faculty of Business and Social
Sciences, respectively. Only 4.6% of the students were enrolled in the
Faculty of Arts and Design. The general characteristics of the participants
are described in Table 1.

Self-medication was reported by 91.4% (n=127) of participants. When
asked about their frequency of consumption, 68.3% of the sample
reported self-medicating once a month, although 23% reported practicing
self-medication every 15 days. Out of the percentage of the sample that
reported self-medicating, 58.3% were female and the remaining were
male. Students enrolled in the Faculty of Business Sciences reported selfmedicating the least, with a prevalence of self-medication of 83.3%,
followed by the students of Health Sciences, who reported a 90.2%

prevalence. On the other hand, 100% of the students enrolled in the
Faculty of Social Sciences reported practicing self-medication.

The principal symptoms associated with self-medication were headache
(75.4%), flu (63.5%) and allergies (34.9%). Acid reflux, stomach ache,
diarrhea, and infectious diseases were also reported on lower percentages
(Figure 1).

Each student reported consuming an average of 2.15, ± 1.08 drugs. As
for the types of drugs consumed, participants predominantly reported
using paracetamol (53.5%) and other NSAIDS (45.7%), followed by
antihistamines (15%), anti-flu decongestants (15%) and antacids (15%).
12.6% of the sample does not remember the name of the medication they
consumed, but do recall self-medicating. A smaller percentage of the
sample reported self-medicating with antibiotics, contraceptives, and
antiemetics.

62.4% of the students that reported self-medicating don't believe their
symptoms require medical attention, and 40.8% reported not having time
to consult a physician. Interestingly, only 16% of participants listed a lack
of economic resources as a reason to self-medicate. (Table 2).

The primary sources of advice for taking medications for all students were
family members (72.6%) and pharmacy staff (37.9%). Other primary
sources reported are shown in Figure 2.

Only 44.9% of the students reported reading the instructions for use. 85%
reported having a home pharmacy.

Logistic regression showed a

significant association between self-medication and having a home
pharmacy.

Despite the high prevalence of self-medication among the Costa Rican
student population, 77.8% of the sample considered self-medication a
risky practice.

Discussion
In the present study, 91.4% of the participants reported self-medicating.
This result is similar to that reported in similar studies conducted with
university students in Spain (90%) (6) , Slovenia (96%) (9) Peru (98%)
(10), United States (89%) (11) and Mexico (96%) (12). Interestingly, the
prevalence of self-medication is higher than that obtained by the survey
"Actualidades 2017", conducted by the School of Statistics of the
University of Costa Rica, which estimated that 81.7% of Costa Ricans selfmedicate (13).

The high prevalence obtained can be attributed to different factors, such
as easy accessibility to over-the-counter medications, and the fact that
85% of respondents have a home pharmacy. It has been proven that
having medications stored in the place of residence increases the risk of
self-medication

(13).

This

confirms

the

important

role

that

the

pharmaceutical industry plays in controlling such practice.

There were no significant differences in the prevalence of self-medication
between healthcare and non-healthcare students

(p= 0.456), which differs from that found in studies in Slovenia (9),
Mozambique (14), which reported a lower prevalence of self-medication
in healthcare students, and resembles what was reported by Spanish
researchers (6).

As for the types of drugs, analgesics were the group of drugs most
consumed by self-medication. More than half of the sample reported selfmedicating with paracetamol (53.5%), and 45.7% reported consuming
other NSAIDs. The use of analgesics and anti-inflammatories is related to
the main symptoms associated with self-medication: Headache (75.4%)
and flu (63.5%). These findings are similar to those reported in similar
studies (6, 9-11). Although analgesics are extremely useful drugs, the
non-responsible consumption of paracetamol and NSAIDs is related to
hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and ulceration of the gastric mucosa (15).
According to records issued by the National Poison Center of the Costa
Rican social security system, Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, drug
intoxication causes 58% of poisonings in Costa Rica. In 2014, a daily
average of 12 cases of drug poisoning was recorded. The majority of cases
reported were caused by intoxication with paracetamol, which was also
the drug most of this study’s participants reported self-medicating with.
(16). The implementation of regulatory policies is important to regulate
its consumption and minimize its risks.

It should be noted that the present study found a higher consumption of
antihistamines than that reported in similar studies conducted in other
countries (11,12,14). This may be related to the prevalence of rhinitis and
allergies in the Costa Rican population (42.6%), as well as environmental
and geographical factors (17). In Costa Rica, the medications with the
highest prevalence of poisoning are paracetamol, antihistamines, and
ibuprofen (16,18). These drugs correspond to those most consumed by
the sample in the study, which suggests there is an

urgent need to

deepen existing efforts to inform and educate about the safe use of
medications.

The fact that the main reasons for self-medication are lack of time and
the lack of necessity to visit a physician confirm the role that access to
information through the internet plays to make users feel aware of
pathologies and symptoms. This is a double-edged sword, as it increases
the role that consumers play in their healthcare decisions, but can also
lead to misdiagnoses and poor adherence to treatments (19). Waiting lists
in social security facilities and the high costs of private medical
consultants also influence this practice (20).

75% of the sample listed family members as main sources of information
for the medicines they consumed, which leads one to think selfmedication is an accepted practice among Costa Ricans. It is important to
carry out complementary studies in other population groups in order to
establish possible intervention points to promote responsible selfmedication and avoid the risks that come with the practice.

This study has limitations that need to be addressed, among which are
the small sample size used, the fact that the sample refers to a specific
geographic area, the use of a questionnaire as the data collection
instrument, and possible memory bias. Despite its limitation, the present
study offers the possibility to guide other researchers and health
organizations working to address the issue.

Conclusion
The consumption of over-the-counter drugs among Costa Rican university
students deserves further study. The high prevalence of self-medication
found demonstrates the need for local health authorities to implement
regulatory and managerial strategies to control the practice, and
prevention campaigns to educate the population and promote responsible
self-medication and rational drug consumption. Improved knowledge and
understanding might help increase the benefits and reduce the risks
associated with self-medication.
