Abstract

51

Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) are the most commonly-used

52

treatments against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa. The lumefantrine and amodiaquine

53

partner drugs may provide differing durations of post-treatment prophylaxis, an important additional

54

benefit to patients. Analyzing 4214 individuals from clinical trials in 12 sites, we estimated a mean

55

duration of post-treatment protection of 13.0 days (95% CI 10.7-15.7) for AL and 15.2 days (95% CI

56

12.8-18.4) for AS-AQ after allowing for transmission intensity. However, the duration varied

57

substantially between sites: where wild type pfmdr1 86 and pfcrt 76 parasite genotypes predominated,

58

AS-AQ provided ~2-fold longer protection than AL. Conversely, AL provided up to 1.5-fold longer

59

protection than AS-AQ where mutants were common. We estimate that choosing AL or AS-AQ as

60

first-line treatment according to local drug sensitivity could alter population-level clinical incidence of

61

malaria by up to 14% in under-five year olds where malaria transmission is high.

Introduction

65
66

Nearly all malaria-endemic countries use artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as first-line

67

treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In each ACT, the artemisinin derivative

68

is combined with a different antimalarial partner drug. There are currently five ACTs recommended by

69

the World Health Organization (WHO): artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-

70

AQ), dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine, artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ), and artesunate-

71

sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS-SP) (1). In areas where other ACTs are failing, WHO also suggest

72

considering a sixth ACT: artesunate-pyronaridine, now prequalified by WHO (2).

73
74

Each of the six drug regimens has different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and

75

these have implications for the public health benefit of the drugs in terms of their ability to reduce

76

overall malaria transmission in the community, as well as cure disease (3). The artemisinin derivatives

77

are highly potent antimalarials that rapidly reduce the parasite biomass; however, they have a very

78

short half-life. The partner drugs remain in the blood for longer, clearing remaining parasites and

79

incidentally providing chemoprophylaxis against reinfection which may have an important impact in

80

moderate-to-high transmission areas (4-6). Some antimalarials have additional activity against

81

gametocytes, the transmissible form of the parasite, and these are better at preventing onward

82

transmission from the patient after treatment. Gametocyte killing may therefore benefit the community

83

through reduction of the overall transmission level (5).

84
85

Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is globally the most widely used ACT, followed by artesunate-

86

amodiaquine (AS-AQ) (7). While resistance to artemisinin has emerged in South-East Asia (8) and a

87

degree of resistance to the partner drugs exists in some parts of the world, both treatments remain

88

highly effective in most African malaria-endemic areas (9-12). The pharmacokinetic properties of each

89

drug are relatively well characterized: lumefantrine and its metabolite desbutyl-lumefantrine have

90

terminal elimination half-lives of 1-10 days (1, 13-16), while desethylamodiaquine, the active

91

metabolite of amodiaquine, has a half-life of 4-10 days (1, 17-22). However, these estimates do not

92

provide information on the duration of post-treatment prophylaxis which also depends on the

93

pharmacodynamics of the drug.

95

There is evidence that the duration of protection after AS-AQ and AL treatment is affected by parasite

96

mutations associated with reduced drug sensitivity (9, 11). These two drugs show collateral sensitivity,

97

such that the mutations 86Y and 1246Y in the pfmdr1 gene and 76T in the pfcrt gene are linked to

98

reduced sensitivity to AS-AQ but increased sensitivity to AL, which is thought to be due to differential

99

sensitivity to the amodiaquine and lumefantrine partner drugs rather than the artemisinin. Although the

100

overall efficacy of each drug remains high in Africa, a meta-analysis found that the N86 wild type

101

parasite was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of recrudescence after AL treatment (9, 11). All

102

these mutations were also associated with a reduced time to reinfection after AS-AQ treatment, and an

103

increased time to reinfection after AL treatment, although the exact duration of protection was not

104

estimated since this also depends on the local rate of transmission and thus reinfection.

105
106

The duration of protection can be estimated from clinical trials where reinfection rates are monitored.

107

We previously estimated the mean protection provided by AL at 13.8 days, and DHA-piperaquine at

108

29.4 days (4). The duration of protection provided by amodiaquine is not well known, although there

109

are indications that it might confer longer protection than lumefantrine (23, 24). Here, we use a

110

statistical analysis of pooled clinical trial data from multiple sites in Africa, explicitly incorporating

111

local transmission intensity as well as drug effects into analyzing the time to reinfection, to estimate the

112

duration of post-treatment prophylaxis after AS-AQ and AL. We use these results in an epidemiological

113

transmission model to establish the differences in public health impact when AS-AQ versus AL is used

114

as first-line drug for P. falciparum case management.

Results

117

Duration of protection after AL and AS-AQ treatment in different trial sites

118

We analyzed 4214 individual participant data from randomized clinical trials in 12 sites obtained from

119

the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) data platform (25) with the consent of

120

investigators or sponsors. The median age in the study population was 2.8 years (IQR 1.5-4.2). Patients

121

were followed up until at least day 28 and assessed for the presence of reinfection, using PCR to

122

distinguish reinfecting parasites from recrudescence of the original infection. The time to reinfection in

123

these trials is only in part determined by the duration of protection conferred by the drug. This is

124

because individuals do not immediately become reinfected after the protection ends, but rather enter an

125

“at-risk” state. Thereafter they are reinfected at a rate dependent on the incidence of blood-stage

126

infections in the population (which in turn depends on the entomological inoculation rate (EIR), the

127

number of infectious bites per person per year). We accounted for the differing incidence of infection in

128

the different trial sites using prior information on malaria transmission intensity from the Malaria Atlas

129

Project (26, 27), estimated at the location and year in which each trial was carried out. We then

130

employed two statistical approaches: (1) a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) to estimate the actual

131

duration of chemoprophylaxis based on the timing of reinfections in patients and (2) a series of

132

accelerated failure time models to provide a better understanding of the factors that modify it (see also

133

Methods).

134
135

With data pooled across trials, the mean duration of protection against reinfection after AS-AQ

136

treatment was estimated at 15.2 days (95% CI 12.8-18.4), and after AL treatment, 13.0 days (95% CI

137

10.7-15.7) (Figure 1). There appeared to be a more gradual transition from a protected to an

138

unprotected state after treatment with AS-AQ compared to AL (Figures 1B & 1C). However, the site-

139

specific estimates of the duration of post-treatment prophylaxis for each drug were heterogeneous, with

140

mean estimates ranging from 10.2-18.7 days for AS-AQ and 8.7-18.6 days for AL (Figures 1B & 1C,

141

Table 1). The proportion of patients reinfected in the AS-AQ trial arm was lower than the AL arm in 7

142

sites, while it was higher in the 5 other sites by the end of follow up. (Figure 2). This heterogeneity was

143

confirmed by the posterior estimates of the duration hyper-parameters, which suggested non-zero

144

variance of the random site effects. The heterogeneity existed despite the analysis taking into account

145

variation in EIR, which ranged from an estimated 2 to 117 infectious bites per person per year. While

146

there was, as expected, a reduced total time to reinfection with higher EIR, after accounting for EIR we

147

found no trend for duration of drug protection by EIR (Figure S1). Overall the model was able to fit the

148

data well, with the model predicted values being within the 95% confidence intervals of the proportion

149

of individuals reinfected at each follow up time in almost all sites (Figure 2). Posterior EIR values were

150

mostly in line with the MAP-based prior values but differed considerably for a small number of

151

locations (Figure 3, Table 1). For sensitivity analysis, we tried including additional age-independent

152

variation in exposure to mosquito bites as in a previous analysis (see Methods), since this influences

153

the distribution of reinfection times within a cohort. Such additional variation represents factors such as

154

living close to a breeding site, housing quality, etc. This analysis found similar estimates of the duration

155

of protection after AS-AQ and AL as did the model without additional variation in exposure, at 16.5

156

days (95% CI 14.2-19.3) and 14.1 days (95% CI 11.7-16.9), respectively. Therefore, for parsimony we

157

did not include this factor in the final result.

Posterior estimates of the duration of protection (A) and the proportion of the population still protected from reinfection over time since first

dose with either AS-AQ (B) or AL (C). In B and C the solid lines show the mean estimate across trial sites, while the dotted lines show the

162

different estimates for each of the 12 trial sites The equations of the lines in B and C are reverse cumulative gamma distributions, and can be

163

implemented for example in R as 1-pgamma(t, shape= r , scale=  ), where t is time in days, and r and  are the shape and scale parameters

164

of the gamma distribution, respectively. For AL, r = 93.5 and mean  =0.139. For AS-AQ, r =16.8 and mean  =0.906. The mean of each

165

gamma distribution r  gives the duration of protection from each drug. The site-specific lines can be calculated using the median durations

166

of prophylaxis in Table 1 and the same shape parameter (assumed not to vary between site for each drug).

Factors affecting the duration of prophylaxis

184

To investigate which factors affect the duration of prophylaxis after AS-AQ and AL treatment and

185

might explain the heterogeneity between trial sites, the data were further analyzed by accelerated

186

failure time regression models. As expected, EIR (as estimated for each site by the HSMM analysis)

187

was strongly associated with time to reinfection (Table 2). We therefore adjusted for EIR before testing

188

the effect of any additional variables. Treatment arm had a small and significant effect on time to

189

reinfection overall, with AS-AQ being associated with a 1.09-fold increase in time to reinfection (95%

190

CI 1.05-1.13) compared to AL, after adjusting for log EIR. We explored the effect of molecular markers

191

associated with parasite sensitivity to AL and AS-AQ. These markers were not directly measured

192

during these trials. Instead, for each trial we sought studies close in space and time which measured the

193

prevalence of pfmdr1 86Y, pfmdr1 1246Y and pfcrt 76T mutations among infected individuals, using

194

recently completed systematic reviews.(63, 64) We included matches when the study was conducted in

195

the same country, within 300km of the trial site and within 1 year of the trial start or end year. We

196

identified pfmdr1 matches to 11 trial sites, and pfcrt matches to 10 sites; however there were too few

197

matched surveys of pfmdr1 1246Y to analyze this third mutation further. Local prevalence of the

198

mutations pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T significantly altered the association between drug and time to

199

reinfection. AS-AQ was associated with a significant 1.37 (95% CI 1.28-1.47)-fold increase in time to

200

reinfection compared to AL when pfmdr1 86Y prevalence was 20% (the lowest level observed in the

201

trial sites), but a significantly shorter time to reinfection than AL when pfmdr1 86Y was 80% (ratio of

202

reinfection times AS-AQ vs AL= 0.89 95% CI 0.84-0.94). Similarly, AS-AQ was associated with a 1.54

203

(95% CI 1.38-1.71)-fold increase in time to reinfection compared to AL when pfcrt 76T prevalence was

204

20%, but a 1.06 (95% CI 1.03-1.10)-fold change when pfcrt 76T prevalence was 80%. Other factors

205

that were significantly associated with longer time to reinfection when adjusting each factor only for

206

log EIR were younger age and higher dose of lumefantrine (mg per kg) (Table 2). Increasing age

207

amongst children was associated with a shorter time to reinfection in a non-linear manner, such that the

208

change in reinfection time with age was most rapid at younger ages, consistent with observed biting

209

patterns by age (65). There was a trend for shorter time to reinfection in underweight individuals and

210

when the loose non-fixed-dose combination (NFDC) formulation of AS-AQ was used, though the

211

association was not statistically significant after adjusting for log EIR.

212
213

We constructed multivariable models for each treatment arm separately. In the AL arm, EIR, age,

214

lumefantrine dose (mg per kg), local pfmdr1 86Y prevalence and pfcrt 76T prevalence remained at least

215

borderline significant predictors of time to reinfection (Tables 3 & S1). However, pfmdr1 86Y

216

prevalence and pfcrt 76T prevalence were so closely correlated (Figure S2) that their effects could not

217

be distinguished from each other in the absence of haplotype data, and we built separate multivariable

218

models to look at each mutation. In the AL arm, both the pfmdr1 86Y and the pfcrt 76T mutations were

219

associated with a 1.04-fold increase in time to reinfection per 10% increase in their prevalence

220

(p=0.052 and p=0.005, respectively) after adjusting for EIR, age and lumefantrine dose.

221
222

In the AS-AQ arm, EIR, age and pfmdr1 86Y prevalence remained significantly associated with time to

223

reinfection overall, with 86Y associated with a 0.97-fold decrease in reinfection time per 10% increase

224

in prevalence (p=0.011). For sensitivity analysis we repeated the regression model including only the

225

trial sites which used the fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulation of AS-AQ, and here the effect of

226

pfmdr1 86Y was no longer statistically significant although the effect size remained similar (0.98 (95%

227

CI 0.95, 1.01)-fold change in reinfection times, p=0.159). Again, we looked at pfcrt 76T in a separate

228

multivariable model in the AS-AQ arm; here it was no longer significantly associated with reinfection

229

time after adjusting for EIR and age, although there was still a trend for shorter time to reinfection as

230

76T prevalence increased (0.98-fold change in time to reinfection per 10% increase in 76T prevalence;

231

95% CI 0.95, 1.01).

232
233

We further investigated the relationship of pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T prevalence with prophylactic time

234

by examining the site-specific estimates from the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) analysis. The

235

mean duration of protection from the HSMM (which is adjusted for EIR and age) was 16.9-17.8 days

236

for AS-AQ in the trial sites with the lowest recorded 86Y and 76T prevalence (Bobo-Dioulasso and

237

Gourcy in Burkina Faso), while it was 10.2-13.1 days in the trial sites with the highest 86Y and 76T

238

prevalence (Tororo, Uganda and Fougamou, Gabon) (Figure 4A & 4C). Conversely, the duration of

239

protection provided by AL was 8.7-12.5 days in the sites with the lowest 86Y and 76T prevalence,

240

while in sites with higher 86Y and 76T prevalence, the duration of AL protection was variable but

241

generally higher, at 11.5-18.6 days (Figure 4B & 4D).

262

time after adjusting for EIR (p<0.05) were included in the final model. The prevalence of pfcrt 76T also

263

had a significant effect in a multivariable model with the same covariates (Table S1) but could not be

274

Model-estimated population-level impact of using AS-AQ versus AL as first-line treatment

275

The duration of prophylaxis provided by an antimalarial used as first-line treatment affects overall clinical

276

incidence in a population because (a) it provides individual-level protection against reinfection and (b)

277

prevention of reinfection reduces the total prevalence of infection in a population, and therefore onward

278

transmission from infected individuals. Simulations comparing the public-health impact of using either AL

279

or AS-AQ as first-line drug were run using an existing individual-based age-structured mathematical model

280

of Plasmodium falciparum transmission. The model incorporates clinical episodes by age and exposure

281

which have been fitted to data in a wide variety of settings.(66) We simulated low, medium and high

282

transmission areas (pre-intervention slide prevalence in 2-10 year olds=5%, 15% and 50%, respectively),

283

with and without seasonal variation in transmission (Figure S3). Given the variation in prophylactic time

284

between areas, we chose to use estimates from two of the trial sites with the most contrasting effects of the

285

two drugs (Figure 5). In the trial in Gourcy, Burkina Faso in 2010-2012, there was low local prevalence of

286

the pfmdr1 86Y mutation (18%) and the pfcrt 76T mutation (25%), with a correspondingly long estimated

287

duration of protection by AS-AQ at 17.8 days, approximately twice as long as the estimated duration of

288

protection by AL in this site: 8.7 days. Using the prophylactic profiles estimated in this trial site (Figure

289

5A), we introduced either AL or AS-AQ as first-line treatment into our simulation, assuming 80% of

290

clinical episodes in all ages are treated with this drug, and the total number of clinical episodes occurring in

291

0-5 year olds over the subsequent 5 years was compared between the two treatments. The longer

292

prophylactic time of AS-AQ reduced clinical episodes in all transmission scenarios (Figure 5B & 5C), but

293

was most pronounced in simulations with higher, very seasonal transmission. When slide-prevalence was

294

50% and transmission was seasonal, using AS-AQ rather than AL prevented 1.6 clinical episodes per child

295

over the 5 years (Figure 5B) (14% of all clinical episodes; Figure 5C). When considering all age groups, an

296

estimated 10% of clinical episodes were prevented (Figure S4).

297
298

In Nimba in Liberia (trial conducted 2008-2009) the local prevalence of pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T were

299

much higher at 69% and 95%, and the duration of prophylaxis provided by AS-AQ was estimated at only

300

11.6 days, while the AL prophylactic time was 17.9 days (Figure 5D). Here, using AS-AQ rather than AL

301

increased the cumulative number of clinical episodes per 0-5 year old child by up to 1.1 over the 5 year

302

simulated period (an increase of 11%), with the largest difference between drugs again observed in the very

303

seasonal, high transmission scenario (Figure 5E & 5F). When considering all age groups, clinical episodes

304

increased by up to 8% (Figure S4).

305
306

It is uncertain whether there is any difference in human infectiousness after treatment with AL versus AS-

307

AQ. We therefore ran the simulations twice, assuming firstly that patients are equally infectious after

308

treatment with either ACT, and secondly assuming that patients treated with AS-AQ are twice as infectious,

309

in accordance with previous studies (47, 67). In both settings, there was minimal difference in impact on

310

clinical episodes (<1%) if we assumed that patients treated with AL were half as infectious as those treated

311

with AS-AQ, compared with the scenarios where infectiousness was assumed to be equal after each

312

treatment (results not shown). This is because even if there is some difference between treatments, both are

313

estimated to have a high impact on gametocytes. Therefore, at a population level, transmission to

314

mosquitoes is dominated by untreated infections which are thought to last on average about 6 months,

315

according to our model assumptions and parameters.(66, 68, 69)

Discussion

330

In this analysis of clinical trials from 12 sites in Africa, we initially estimated that AS-AQ provided a

331

slightly longer duration of post-treatment prophylaxis than AL (15.2 versus 13.0 days) when all data were

332

pooled together. However, the duration of protection varied considerably between trial sites. In some

333

locations AS-AQ provided up to an estimated 19 days of protection, ~2-fold longer than AL, while in other

334

trial sites the reverse was true, with AL providing up to 19 days of protection, which was up to 1.5-fold

335

longer than AS-AQ. This difference between sites appeared to be in part explained by the local prevalence

336

of pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T at the time of the trial, with AS-AQ providing better protection where wild

337

type parasites with N86 and K76 genotypes were predominant, and AL performing better where 86Y and

338

76T mutants were common. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the collateral sensitivity

339

of parasites with these different pfmdr1 and pfcrt genotypes to AL and AS-AQ. Our analysis extends

340

previous work (9, 11, 70) by explicitly estimating the duration of protection provided by each drug in sites

341

with different prevalence of 86Y and 76T mutants, also taking into account the different EIRs across the

342

trial sites so as to distinguish the effect of the drugs from that of the local transmission intensity on the time

343

to reinfection.

344
345

Our transmission modelling suggests that the difference in duration of protection between the two drugs in

346

areas with very low or very high 86Y and 76T prevalence can have a public health impact, especially where

347

malaria transmission is high and seasonal. We estimate that up to 14% of clinical episodes could be

348

prevented in 0-5 year old children by using the drug providing optimal protection in a given setting, due to

349

both individual protection from reinfection and population level reduction in transmission (when 80% of

350

clinical episodes receive treatment). Countries with low (<20%) or high (>80%) prevalence of 86Y and 76T

351

and intense transmission could consider the benefit of longer duration of protection if choosing between AL

352

and AS-AQ policies. Using a first line treatment with longer duration of protection is potentially a cost-

353

effective way of reducing clinical cases and infections,(4) given the comparable price of AL and AS-AQ

354

(71). Compared to published estimates, both AL and AS-AQ provided a shorter duration of protection than

355

prevent up to 15% more cases than AL (4, 72).

The pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T mutations, initially driven through the parasite population by the previous

fastest in countries using AL, consistent with the expected direction of selection (64). The efficacy of AS-

361

AQ appears to have improved in some countries and there is interest in increasing the use of the drug

362

regimen where 86Y and 76T prevalence have declined (55). However, there are many other considerations

363

to choosing a first-line treatment, such as side effects, tolerability, cost of implementing a new policy, etc.

364

Amodiaquine is also widely used together with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in seasonal malaria

365

chemoprevention (SMC) programmes in children in the Sahel region of Africa, given to 12 million children

366

under five years of age in 2016 (73). Our results could be used together with information on the

367

chemoprophylaxis provided by SP, to inform potential changes in the efficacy of SMC as 86Y and 76T

368

prevalence change. This may be particularly important in areas with partial SP resistance. Currently, WHO

369

recommends not using drug regimens containing AQ or SP as first line treatment in countries implementing

370

SMC (74). Indeed most SMC countries currently use AL as first-line (7). Our results support previous

371

findings suggesting that selective pressures exerted by AL and AS-AQ may counteract each other. However,

372

our results suggest it would not be possible to achieve maximal prophylactic effect of either AL or AS-AQ

373

at the same time in a given setting. Triple ACT which combine an artemisinin derivative with both

374

lumefantrine and amodiaquine are currently in trials (75), and would be likely to ensure longer prophylactic

375

protection.

376
377

Our finding that the pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T mutations are associated with a longer time to reinfection

378

after AL treatment and a shorter time after AS-AQ is consistent with a previous meta-analysis, where

379

individual patient data on genotypes post-treatment were available.(9, 11) We did not include such a wide

380

range of studies as the previous meta-analysis because our methods required that we estimate the EIR for

381

each included trial site, which is only possible when sufficient numbers of reinfections are observed per site

382

and we included only randomized trials. The advantage of our approach, however, is that we can obtain

383

estimates of prophylactic times after adjusting for the local transmission intensity. One limitation of our

384

study was that we did not have individual level data on genotypes pre and post-treatment, which were not

385

measured in the trials we included here. This might have allowed a more precise estimate of the effect of

386

mutations on prophylactic time, and ideally comparison of pfcrt and pfmdr1 haplotypes. Also, while we

387

matched trials to the closest possible measures of mutation prevalence, these may not reflect the prevalence

388

in the trial sites which can vary over space and time. We could not distinguish separate effects of 86Y and

389

76T in this analysis due to the close correlation of their prevalence. Other previous meta-analyses have

390

examined the effect of dosing and other covariates on the probability of recrudescence after AL (10) and

391

AS-AQ (12). The trends in our analysis looking at reinfection as the outcome rather than recrudescence

392

agree well with these previous studies; in particular the use of loose NFDC formulation of AS-AQ was

393

associated with reduced time to reinfection although it was not statistically significant after adjusting for

394

EIR. Of the three studies using loose NFDC, two of these showed a longer prophylactic time by AL,

395

compared to two out of the remaining 9 studies which used FDC.

396
397

Our estimate of the mean duration of prophylaxis after AL at 13.0 days is in good agreement with our

398

previous estimate of 13.8 days which was obtained from analysis of a completely different dataset of

399

clinical trials in six sites in Africa (4) (although the impact of 86Y and 76T was not previously

400

investigated). In the current analysis we found a more rapid decline of protection over time after AL

401

treatment than AS-AQ (Figure 1), and a similar rapid decline after AL was seen in our previous analysis.

402

The resolution of data informing this profile of post-treatment prophylaxis is not perfect, with most patients

403

observed only weekly after day 7. In 4 of the trial sites in the current analysis, no tests for reinfection were

404

done until day 14 (23). Nevertheless given the very low proportion of individuals reinfected at earlier times

405

in the other sites it is unlikely that many reinfections were missed. In most trials patients were followed up

406

until day 28, and differential reinfection rates may have been missed after this time. We lacked data from a

407

control arm to parameterize the proportion of individuals reinfected over time in the absence of treatment. If

408

our model underestimates the rate of increase in the proportion of individuals reinfected in the absence of

409

treatment, it could overestimate the rapid drop off in protection in the AL trial arms to compensate. There is

410

therefore some uncertainty in the shape of the prophylactic profile but if the rapid drop in protection is a

411

real finding, it has implications for the selection of partially resistant parasites to these partner drugs, with

412

lumefantrine potentially having a relatively short window of selection compared to amodiaquine.(76)

413
414

We also did not consider temporal changes in the EIR during the trial. However, these would affect both

415

trial arms equally and could therefore not reverse the relative order of duration of protection between the

416

drugs in one site. Variation between studies may occur due to other factors such as nutritional status,

417

dosage, the genetics of patients or variations in the accuracy of PCR in distinguishing reinfections from

418

recrudescence. For example, PCR accuracy depends on the number of molecular markers used, and in high

419

transmission areas multiple-clone infections can reduce accuracy (77, 78). While none of the trials

420

distributed insecticide-treated nets as part of the study, trial areas probably varied in levels of vector control,

421

which is indirectly taken into account in our analysis since we use estimates of transmission intensity based

422

on the Malaria Atlas Project, who use data on prevalence trends and include vector control in their model.

423

In the randomized design of the studies, it is unlikely that one treatment arm would have had better vector

424

control than another, and therefore the comparison of the drugs would not be affected, although the overall

425

reinfection rate for the area could have been different from expected if the effect of vector control was not

426

well reflected in the MAP data and model.

427
428

In summary, both AL and AS-AQ provide post-treatment prophylaxis which is important for reducing

429

reinfection rates in individuals in higher transmission settings, and may impact on the incidence of malaria

430

in the whole population when these regimens are used widely as first-line treatment. AS-AQ provides

431

longer protection than AL when most infections are by wild-type parasites, while AL provides longer

432

protection than AS-AQ in areas with higher prevalence of the pfmdr1 86Y and pfcrt 76T mutations.

433

Countries may wish to consider the prevalence of these mutations when deciding the first line treatment. In

434

future, it will be important to determine the role of other molecular markers in altering the post-treatment

435

protection provided by ACT partner drugs, such as increased copy number of pfmdr1, which is increasing in

436

prevalence in some parts of Africa.(63)

Materials and Methods

439

Data

440

WWARN invited investigators to contribute individual-level patient data for this meta-analysis (79) if their

441

studies fulfilled the following criteria: randomized controlled trials of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria;

442

AS-AQ and AL being compared; follow-up to at least day 28, with at least one follow-up visit at day 14 and

443

another before day 28; 100 or more participants per study site or more than 28 days follow-up; polymerase

444

chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted efficacy available; at least 95% PCR-adjusted treatment efficacy in both

445

study arms; PCR-unadjusted cure rates of <95% in at least one trial arm by day 28 (to indicate sufficient

446

number of reinfections to inform analysis on post-treatment prophylaxis); standard dose regimens of AL

447

and AS-AQ (we included studies regardless whether AS-AQ was given as a fixed-dose combination or not);

448

and known dosage taken for each patient. Individual patient data from eligible studies were shared, collated

449

and standardized using previously described methodology (80).

450
451

For the present analyses, we used data on PCR-confirmed reinfections as well as the proportion of patients

452

who were not reinfected during follow up, to estimate the duration of chemoprophylaxis. Time of

453

reinfection is included in the analysis so that different follow up times between studies are accounted for

454

(see also below). Patients who experienced PCR-confirmed recrudescence were excluded. In two studies (in

455

Tororo, Uganda & Sikasso, Mali, see Table 1) the patients were followed up longitudinally across several

456

episodes, and consequently treated multiple times within short intervals. We only used the first treatment

457

episode and follow-up data collected before the next episode from these studies in order to avoid

458

confounding of our results by residual drug levels from a previous treatment.

459
460

For each trial, we sought surveys of the prevalence of pfmdr1 86Y, pfmdr1 1246Y and pfcrt 76T mutations

461

in the same country, within 300km of the trial site and within 1 year of the trial start or end year (see also

462

Results). For sites with many matching molecular marker surveys, we applied a stricter distance criterion of

463

100km of the trial site. When more than one matching survey was found, we took a weighted average of the

464

mutant prevalence. We did not include molecular marker studies on post-treatment samples.

465
466

One included study did not have available data on the individual ages of participants, but provided body

467

weight (55), and another study recorded age but not body weight (49). We imputed the missing values in

468

order to be able to include these studies. To impute missing age, we randomly sampled ages of participants

469

of the same gender from all other studies who had bodyweights within 0.5kg of the observed participants’

470

weights; to impute missing body weight we sampled weights of individuals of the same gender within 0.5

471

years of age for those under 25, and within 5 years for those over 25 years of age.

472
473

Prior information on the force of infection

474

The time to reinfection is determined both by the duration of protection conferred by the drug and the force

475

of infection (FOI) (the number of blood-stage infections acquired per person per year). More specifically,

476

the time span between the end of the protected period and reinfection follows an exponential distribution

477

with mean 1/φ, assuming a time-constant force of infection φ. We used predictions of the FOI as prior

478

values in our model, based on prevalence of infection in 2-10 year olds (PR2-10) estimated by the Malaria

479

Atlas Project (MAP) (26, 27). When the trial took place over several years, we averaged slide-prevalence

480

over this time. These PR2-10 values were transformed into predictions of the entomological inoculation rate

481

(EIR) using the relationship between these two variables obtained from our existing mathematical model of

482

malaria transmission (66), allowing calculation of location-specific prior values for φ as explained below.

483
484

Hidden Semi-Markov Models: The transition of an individual from a drug-protected state to a non-protected

485

state, where they are at risk of reinfection after chemoprophylaxis, is not observed. We observe only

486

whether the patient has become reinfected, after a certain time has passed since treatment. This sequence of

487

events can be interpreted as realization of a stochastic process belonging to the class of Hidden Semi-

488

Markov Models (HSMMs), which we used to estimate the duration of protection provided by treatment.

489

More specifically, we modeled the time to reinfection Ri in host i as

490
491

Ri = Pdi + Ii + δ

492
493

where Pdi is the duration of chemoprophylaxis of drug d in host i, Ii is the time until reinfection occurs in

494

host i once at risk, and δ represents the time required for a blood-stage infection to become patent after

495

hepatocyte rupture (assumed 3.5 days (81)). P and I were parameterized as random variables as follows:

496
497

Pdi ~ gamma(λdi , rd)

501

Ii ~ exp(1/φi)

502
503

with φi being the force of infection to which individual i was exposed during the trial follow-up. Individual-

504

specific EIR values εi were determined, taking into account that young children are bitten less often due to

505

their smaller body size, according to the formula

506
507

εi = εadult (1- ρ exp(-ai/a0))

508
509

where εadult is the estimated site-specific EIR experienced by fully grown individuals, a is age and

510

parameters a0=2920 days and ρ=0.85 control the shape of the relationship (82). Pre-erythrocytic immunity ,

511

i.e. an immune response that reduces the proportion of infectious bites resulting in successful blood stage

512

infections was computed for each individual according to their age, prior exposure and local EIR , using the

513

same mathematical model referenced above (66). For sensitivity analysis, we also tried assuming additional

514

age-independent variation in exposure to mosquito bites, with the distribution of relative biting rates across

515

people following a log-normal distribution. We used informative priors on the lognormal distribution of

516

bites of mean=1 and variance=1.76 as previously estimated (66).

517
518

A number of HSMM variants were fitted via MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo), using the JAGS (“Just

519

Another Gibbs Sampler”) software for Bayesian inference in conjunction with the “rjags” package using R

520

statistical software (83). The likelihood calculation took into account the interval- and right-censoring of

521

observations in the data. EIR values εadult for each site were estimated simultaneously with the other

522

parameters, with moderately informative gamma priors with median as predicted by MAP (27) (Table 1)

523

and a shape parameter of 1.56. Using this prior information on EIR was essential, otherwise a slow

524

reinfection rate could be explained equally well by either a low EIR or a long drug prophylactic time. After

525

examining the posterior distributions of several candidate models, we included heterogeneity among trial

526

sites in the mean duration of chemoprophylaxis, which was modeled as a gamma-distributed random effect.

527

A weakly informative, empirical-Bayes gamma prior was used for the shape parameter r, with

528

hyperparameters (parameters of the prior distribution) determined using a fit of the HSMM with non-

529

informative priors. This improved MCMC convergence. Non-informative gamma priors were chosen for all

530

remaining estimated parameters. We ran the MCMC procedure for 1.25 million iterations, retaining 100,000

532
533

Accelerated failure time models: In order to identify which factors influence the time until a reinfection is

534

detected, we used accelerated failure time models, as implemented in the “survival” package in R (84). We

535

explored lognormal and log-logistic distributions of time to reinfection, which allow the hazard of

536

reinfection to vary over time, and selected lognormal which produced lowest Akaike Information Criterion

537

(AIC). Several covariates were compared with respect to their ability to predict time to reinfection. Since

538

EIR is such a critical predictor of the time to reinfection, we adjusted for this variable in all models, initially

539

in bivariate models with each other covariate, using the log posterior mean EIR estimates from the HSMM

540

analysis for each site. When analyzing age as a covariate, we explored polynomial relationships with

541

reinfection time. The small proportion of individuals in the analysis over 20 years of age (294/3840 with

542

available age data) were grouped together, since model convergence problems were created by lack of data

543

at older ages and because age-dependent exposure to mosquito bites (related to body surface area)(65), as

544

well as development of immunity (66), tends to plateau by 20 years of age. Otherwise, linear relationships

545

were assumed for continuous variables. We tested for interactions between AL or AS-AQ treatment,

546

prevalence of the pfmdr1 86Y mutant versus N86 wild type parasites and pfcrt 76T mutant versus K76 wild

547

type parasites, since there is evidence of differential effects of each drug on these parasite genotypes (9, 11).

548

We tested for an effect of different formulations of AS-AQ, i.e. fixed dose combination (from Sanofi),

549

blister pack or loose dose (see also Table 1 for dose information). For AL, all included studies used the

550

same fixed dose combination from Novartis. We calculated weight-for-age Z scores for patients under 5

551

years old according to the WHO age and gender specific reference values, using the WHO Anthro software

552

in R (85). Individuals were classified as underweight if they had a Z score of less than -2. We investigated

553

being underweight in the children under five years because this was a factor associated with recrudescence

554

after AL in a previous analysis.(10) We calculated mg per kg dose of lumefantrine or amodiaquine for each

555

patient according to their dose and weight. Goodness of fit of the models was assessed by Akaike's

556

Information Criterion (AIC). We used stepwise regression, with both forward selection and backward

557

elimination to ensure all covariates of interest were identified. The best-fitting model was identified using

558

AIC and covariates significantly improving the prediction (LR-test) were kept.

562

The probability of a mosquito becoming infected when feeding on individuals treated with AL relative to

563

untreated individuals was assumed to be 0.051 (66). It is uncertain whether there is any difference in human

564

infectiousness after treatment with AL versus AS-AQ. We therefore ran the simulations twice, assuming

565

firstly that patients are equally infectious after treatment with either ACT, and secondly assuming that

566

patients treated with AS-AQ are twice as infectious, in approximate accordance with the ratio of areas under

567

curves of post-treatment gametocyte prevalence in Schramm et al (47) which is consistent with a meta-

568

analysis showing reduced gametocytemia after treatment with AL compared with AS-AQ (67). The model

569

was first run to equilibrium in the absence of interventions, then we simulated first line treatment with AS-

570

AQ or AL, assuming that 80% of clinical episodes are treated with an antimalarial, that both drugs are 95%

571

efficacious at clearing parasites and that the switch is instantaneous and complete. Prior to introducing ACT,

572

we assume SP was in use, also at 80% coverage but only 60% efficacy. We simulated a population of

573

600,000 individuals to smooth stochastic variation. We adjusted mosquito densities to represent low,

574

medium and high transmission areas (pre-intervention slide prevalence in 2-10 year olds=5%, 15% and

575

50%, respectively in the non-seasonal settings). In the simulations with seasonal variation, we adjusted

576

mosquito densities to achieve the same annual EIR as in each respective low, medium or high transmission

577

non seasonal setting.

Figure S2. Correlation between pfcrt 76T prevalence and pfmdr 86Y prevalence, in the surveys
matched to the trial sites according to year and geographic distance. When more than one molecular
marker survey was matched to a trial site, a weighted average prevalence was taken. In some cases,
these two molecular markers were assessed in the same matched survey(s), but in other cases matches
from different surveys were found.

Figure S3 Simulated annual seasonal variation in EIR assumed in the analysis of potential impact of AL
and AS-AQ on population level transmission (Figure 5, main text). The EIR shown is for the simulated
seasonal medium transmission setting (slide prevalence = 15%), but the relative EIR variation across
the year was the same in the seasonal low and high simulated transmission settings.
