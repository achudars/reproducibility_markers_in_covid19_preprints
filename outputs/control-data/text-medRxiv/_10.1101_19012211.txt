ABSTRACT
The prognostic value of the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), defined as EpCAM+, Cytokeratin (8, 18,
19)+ and CD45- nucleated cells, has been provided in metastatic breast cancer (mBC), with Level I of
evidence. However, CTCs belong to a heterogeneous pool of rare cells, and there isn’t consensus on an
univocal definition of CTCs. Here, we present a definition of metabolically altered CTCs (MBA-CTC)
as CD45-negative cells with an increased extracellular acidification rate (iECAR), supported by the
presence of iECAR among the hallmarks of cancer. We tested the prognostic value of MBA-CTC
present in mBC patients before starting a new systemic therapy (T0) and 3-4 weeks after (T1). Samples
were analyzed in parallel with CellSearch platform (CS). Standard RECIST criteria were used to
determine patients’ responses to treatment.
In our cohort of n=31 mBC patients, a level of MBA-CTCs above the cut-off was associated with: i) a
shorter median PFS both pre-therapy (123 days vs 306; p<0.0001) and during therapy (139 vs 266
days; p= 0.0009); ii) a worse OS both pre-therapy (p=0.0003, 82% survival vs 20%) and during therapy
(p=0.0301, 67% survival vs 38%); iii) good agreement with therapy response (kappa=0.685). Both the
trend of MBA-CTCs over time and the combined results of the two assays (MBA and CS) enabled
more accurate stratification. MBA and CS results showed fair (K=0.33) and poor (K=0.077) agreement
at T0 and T1, respectively. This fact and the increased accuracy in combining results suggest that the
assays detect different CTC subsets. In conclusion, MBA-CTCs does provide prognostic information at
least equivalent to CS, and are even more informative when analyzed over time or combined with CSCTCs.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with an estimated 2 million of
newly diagnosed cases each year (1). Despite the great advances in the early diagnosis and treatment,
metastatic spread still represents the leading cause of breast cancer-related death (1). The availability of
effective biomarkers able to stratify the patient population which will most likely benefit from a
specific therapy, monitor the treatment response, quantify the minimal residual disease, and promptly
detect the appearance of therapy resistance, still represents a clinical need (2).
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells spread from primary tumor or metastatic sites and
found in body fluids. Their analysis has gained attention as one of the most promising approaches to
face the aforesaid needs in the clinical management of cancer, as CTCs constitute tumor material that
can be accessed with minimal invasiveness, providing real-time information on the evolving biology of
cancer (3–7). There is evidence that CTCs can contribute to form distant metastasis (8), and several
studies demonstrated that the number of CTCs independently correlates with progression of disease in
metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients, outperforming both serum biomarkers (9, 10) and radiologic
imaging techniques (11).
The only currently FDA-approved technology for CTC enumeration in mBC is the CellSearch platform
(Menarini) that detects CTCs relying on the expression of the epithelial marker EpCAM on their
surface. This technology has widely demonstrated the prognostic value of both the number (12–15) and
number variation (11, 16) of CTCs, in patients with early and metastatic BC.
CellSearch and other similar technologies, though, are limited to the detection of CTCs expressing the
epithelial marker EpCAM. However, the invasion of tumor cells from peripheral blood is a complex
process, during which tumor cells can undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that
involves the downregulation of epithelial markers, such as EpCAM, cytokeratins and E-cadherin, and
the upregulation of mesenchymal markers, such as Vimentin and N-cadherin. Several groups have

shown the existence of non-epithelial CTCs and linked these subtypes to disease progression or other
clinical-pathological features (17–21). A plethora of new technologies emerged to overcome the
limitations of EpCAM-based approaches, focusing on the challenge of detecting non-epithelial CTCs,
mainly exploiting mesenchymal markers or physical features of cancer cells and other cancer-specific
traits. Notably, few groups have specifically addressed altered metabolism of cancer cells (22–27) –
recognized as a “hallmark of cancer”(28) – as a promising approach, also in view of the introduction of
specific metabolic agent combined with chemo- or immunotherapies in several clinical trials (29–31).
One of the most described metabolic alterations of cancer cells consists of a markedly increased uptake
of glucose in comparison with normal cells. First described by Otto Warburg in the 1920s, this cancer
feature has been successfully exploited in the clinic by introducing a positron emission tomography
(PET)-based imaging of the uptake of a radioactive glucose analog, which is commonly employed to
stage cancer and assess response to therapy (32). Several groups reported the exploitation of metabolic
alterations to identify CTCs in the peripheral blood of metastatic cancer patients, independently from
EpCAM expression and immunostaining techniques in general (22–27). An mRNAseq study on CTCs
from prostate cancer patients described a category of CTCs with an upregulation of metabolic
transcripts as a potential biomarkers for cancer metastasis (24). Tang et al (22) evaluated the presence
of metabolically active CTCs in pleural effusion and in the peripheral blood of a limited number of
non-small cell lung cancer patients by using the fluorescent glucose analogue 2-NBDG. This finding
was also strengthened by our group in a preliminary study to assess the mutational status of
hypermetabolic CTCs enriched by their elevated 2-NBDG uptake (23). Other microfluidic platforms
have been described for the screening of single-cell uptake of glucose or the release of by-product of
metabolism such as lactate (33) or ROS (34).
In this study we focused on pH dysregulation (35–37): in cancer, an augmented extracellular
acidification is the consequence of both the increased lactate extrusion (in the context of the Warburg

phenomenon) and of the sodium-proton antiporter NHE1 hyperactivity. pH dysregulation, an early
phenomenon in carcinogenesis, is important for cancer cells to gain selective advantages and a more
metastatic phenotype, and the acidic pH of the tumor milieu plays a recognized role in cancer invasion,
metastasis, immunosuppression and therapeutic resistance (35). Therefore, an abnormal metabolism
constitutes an excellent candidate as a functional marker: since it represents an independent feature
with respect to epithelial and mesenchymal markers, in principle, it could be leveraged for CTC
detection without the need to identify specific phenotypic profile.
Droplet-based microfluidic approaches are typically used for the encapsulation of cells, as they allow to
maintain cell growth and proliferation properties and to screen for secreted molecules, as they are
retained inside the droplet (38, 39). We previously demonstrated that the differential release rate of
protons between cancer cell lines and normal white blood cells (WBCs) can be detected in-drop
exploiting a pH-sensitive dye, which allows to assess their increased extracellular acidification rate
(ECAR) by measuring their acidification dynamic (25). As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the
ability of the pH value to discriminate cancer cell lines from WBCs, and to detect CD45-negative cells
with increased ECAR in patients with metastatic cancer of different types (25).
In this paper, we refer to this CTC detection method as “metabolism-based assay” (MBA). Here, we
determined the prognostic role of MBA-CTCs in mBC and compared their performance with epithelial
CTCs, as detected by the gold-standard CellSearch assay (CS-CTCs).

RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics
Between September 2016 and December 2017, 31 consecutive mBC patients were recruited at the
Aviano National Cancer Institute, regardless the number and type of previous lines of treatment. CTCs
were enumerated using both the metabolic-based assay (MBA) and CellSearch assay (CS) prior to the
beginning of a new line of treatment (T0) and after a median of 3 weeks following the first cycle of
therapy (T1). The CONSORT diagram of evaluable patients for each method is shown in fig. S1.
Patient demographics and tumor characteristics at the time of enrollment are summarized in Table 1.
The patients’ median age was 56. Primary tumor receptor status for ER and/or PR (detected by IHC)
and HER2 (evaluated by IHC or FISH) was positive in 21 (68%) and 3 (10%) out of 31 patients,
respectively, while 8 (26%) out of 31 cases were triple-negative (ER-, PR- and HER2-negative).
Among the 31 patients recruited, 11 (35.5%) were starting their first line of therapy for metastatic
disease; 28 (90.0%) received chemotherapy (alone or in combination with other treatments), 2 (6.5%)
received hormone-therapy and 1 (3.2%) patient did not receive any treatment (control group of the ABRAVE clinical trial, NCT02926196).
All patients had a minimal follow-up time of 12 months (median 18 months), and the first follow-up
imaging study was performed on average 5.3 ± 2 months after the T0 blood sample collection.
First imaging re-evaluation after CTC enumeration documented a partial response/stable disease in 13
(42%) out of 31 patients; after the whole period of follow-up, instead, disease progression was
observed in 25 (80.6%) out of 31 cases, and 13 (42.0%) patients deceased. Blood samples from 26
healthy donor (HD) volunteers were analyzed with MBA as negative controls.

MBA description
The overall strategy adopted to detect cancer cells in a background of WBCs, by measuring the
extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (25), is outlined in Fig. 1 and fig. S2. Briefly, single cells were
encapsulated into 15 pL droplets together with a fluorescent pH-sensitive dye (SNARF-5F) (Fig. 1A).
During in-drop incubation, because of the cellular metabolic activity, each cell extruded a certain

subsequent analyses, cells that were negative for CD45 expression and within a droplet with pH<6.4
were considered as MBA-CTCs.
In ex-vivo mBC blood samples, CTC count has been used to categorize patients as negative or positive
for the presence of CTCs, if their count was 0 or ≥ 1, respectively. Moreover, a cut-off of 6 CTCs per
7.5 ml of blood was determined, adopting the same strategy that was used to set at 5 cells the
prognostic cut-off value for the CS assay (10, 15) (see Materials and Methods and fig. S4 for details);
accordingly, patients were stratified as MBA-CTC <6 and MBA-CTC ≥6.
Baseline CTC enumeration
Using the MBA assay, at T0, CTCs were detected in 12 out of 27 patients (44.4%), with 10 patients
(37.0 %) being above the cut-off value of 6 cells. Overall, the average CTC count was 218±1022
(median 0, range 0-5319) (Table 2 and table S1).

Among patients scored as CTCs-positive, CTCs expressing EpCAM were detected in 6 (50.0%), with
an average of 84 ± 90 (median 42, range 9-200), whereas EpCAM-negative CTCs were detected in 10
patients (83.3%), with an average of 539 ± 1612 (median 6, range 3-5125) (table S1 and fig. S5).

comparable to CTCs could be detected in 2 (7.6%) out of 26, showing 4 and 5 cells, respectively (Table
2 and table S2). Please note that these values are obtained by normalizing analysed sample volume to
7.5 mL for easier comparison with CellSearch, as described in the methods section. These two values
correspond to 1 false positive event detected in each of these two HD in 1.9 and 1.5 mL of sample
analyzed, respectively. Overall, HD cohort showed 2 false-positive events in more than 50 millions of
droplets analysed. Notably, none of the HD showed more than 6 cells and the number of CTCs was
significantly higher in mBC patients than in HDs (p=0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test) (fig. S5).
By analyzing the same mBC population by CS, we found that 17 (77.3%) out of 22 evaluable patients
had at least 1 CTC, while 8 (36.0%) patients had a CTC number above the prognostic cut-off of 5 cells
(as established in previous clinical studies) (10, 15). Overall, the average number of CTC was
129±433 (median 3, range 0-2022).
Moreover, we also determined the level of apoptotic CTCs by CS platform, as previously reported (41),
by detecting in CTCs the expression of M30, an epitope of cytokeratin 18 revealed during early phase
of apoptosis. Among the CTC-positive patients, 3 (17.6 %) had at least 1 M30-positive CTC with an
average count of 9 ± 14 (median 1, range 1-25) (table S1).
Changes of CTC levels after starting treatment
By the MBA, 15 (57.7%) out of 26 patients presented at least 1 CTC, while 8 (30.7%) had more than 6
cells. With respect to T0, the overall average number of CTC decreased from 218±1022 to 37±75
(median 4, range 0-280) (Table 2 and table S1). EpCAM-positive cells were found in 7 (46.6%) of
MBA-CTC positive patients, with an average of 48±65 (median 18, range 4-160) cells, whereas
patients presenting EpCAM-negative CTC were 12 (80%) out of 15, with an average of 52±70 (median
14, range 3-225) cells (table S1 and fig. S5).
Comparing CTC number at T0 and T1 for each patient, CTC level decreased in 10 cases and increased
in 6 (fig. S6), while 7 patients were negative at both time-points. The CTC concentration at T0 did not

statistically differ respect to T1 (p=0.2465, Wilcoxon test).
By CS analysis, at T1, 11 (50%) out of 22 evaluable patients had at least 1 detectable CTC, whereas, 5
(23%) out 22 patients showed ≥5 CTCs. The average CTC number decreased from 129±433 to 22±65
(median 1, range 0-288) (Table 2 and S1).
Moreover, among the CTC-positive patients, apoptotic CTCs (M30-positive) were detected in 2
(18,2%) out of 11 sample, accounting for 1 and 7 cells, respectively. Overall, the number of M30positive cells at both time-points was so low that it did not allow reliable data analysis.
Among the 17 patients that had CS paired samples at T0 and T1, 2 (11,8%) had an increase and 10
(58,8%) a decrease in CTC levels, while 5 (29,4%) cases showed unchanged CTC value (fig. S6).
Unlike MBA results, CS-CTC levels significantly differed between T0 and T1 (p=0.0146, Wilcoxon
test).
Comparison of CTC levels using MBA and CS
A total of 22 patients were analyzed in parallel with both the MBA and the CS at T0 and 21 patients at
T1. The total number of patients with a CTC level < or ≥ the cut-off for each technique at each timepoint is reported in Table 3. Using the respective prognostic cut-offs ( MBA: ≥6 CTCs; CS: ≥5 CTCs),
the overall positive concordance was 68.2% at T0 and 61.9% at T1; the correlation between matched
samples was weak at T0 and absent at T1 (T0: Spearman r =0.39; T1: Spearman r = 0.04) (Fig. 2A and
B); this finding combined with a low k-Cohen coefficient (Table 3) indicated low agreement between
the two methods.

DISCUSSION
Studies of other groups involving CTC detected with a metabolism-based approach did not correlate
results with clinical outcome. In the present pilot study, we determined that elevated MBA-CTCs are
linked to shorter overall and progression-free survival. Additional information was obtained
considering CTC levels over time.
One of the limitations of this study is the relatively small cohort involved, though our cohort reflects
general population in terms of cancer subtype prevalence (luminal, HER2-positive, triple-negative),
metastatic sites and lines of therapy. This is further confirmed by the results obtained in this study with
CS, which are aligned with larger clinical trials in metastatic breast, colon and prostate cancers (10, 11,
15, 16, 42, 43). Despite relatively small cohort results display unequivocal statistical significance.
Thus, we feel confident enough stating that the presented results offer robust evidence that MBA-CTCs
are prognostically informative across different subtypes of mBC patients. Another limitation is the
relatively small volume of sample analyzed (2.5mL vs usual 7.5mL), which could have lead to a slight
underestimation of MBA-CTC. The limit of detection is bigger if a smaller volume is analyzed.
Specifically, the limit of detection was 1 MBA-CTC in 2.5 mL, corresponding to 3 MBA-CTC in 7.5
mL. In other words, the presence of <3 MBA-CTC in 7.5 mL might have led to a result 0 MBA-CTC in
2.5 mL, thus falsely underestimating the actual number of CTC. However, this did not affect survival
curves because 3 MBA-CTC is smaller than the cut-off used to stratify patients (MBA-CTC < 6).
Interestingly, the agreement between MBA and CS was relatively weak, while both methods
independently yielded similar prognostic significance. This suggests that the two techniques detect
different CTC subgroups with complementary information, possibly reflecting different aspects of
disease evolution. By combining information of the two assays, additional information could be gained.
This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that the prevalence of single-positive patients (either
MBA or CS above cut-off) is roughly 50% higher than the prevalence obtained considering single

MBA or CS testing. A possible explanation is the fact that metabolism is altered also in non-epithelial,
which are mostly EpCAM-negative and thus not detected by CellSearch. At the same time, our pH
threshold was relatively stringent in order to maximize purity, since it is set in order to obtain absence
of dysmetabolic cells in healthy controls or absence of white blood cells contaminants in other words.
This could lead to “missing” of some EpCAM-positive cells with increased ECAR with respect to
normal WBC, but not enough increased to meet pH threshold.
It should be now clear that referring to CTCs without further definition might be confusing, as it is a
rather blurred group of cells of different nature and maybe distinct clinical implications. More studies
are needed to clearly understand if different types of cells could be linked to specific clinical and
pathological features or therapy susceptibilities.
Hypothesizing a predictive role of MBA-CTC, a growing body of evidence suggests that the acidic
extracellular environment of tumor tissues confers chemoresistance: indeed, a majority of
chemotherapeutics (e.g.: doxorubicin) behaves like weak bases which are quickly protonated in low pH
environments, leading to a reduced cellular uptake and treatment efficacy (44). Thus, restoring a
physiologic extracellular pH is emerging as a new therapeutic strategy to increase tumor
chemosensitivity to traditional chemotherapeutics. Several pH regulator inhibitors have already been
evaluated in several clinical trials (30, 45) and, in this contest, MBA-CTC might represent a fitting
approach to monitor the benefit of this new therapeutic strategy.

CONCLUSION
CTC identified by their aberrant metabolism are at least as tightly linked to survival and disease
progression as epithelial CTCs, either when measured before or after the therapy.
Overall, this pilot study can be used as a foundation to design larger clinical studies to confirm and
validate MBA-CTCs as a prognostic biomarker.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
A pilot study trial was conducted adopting both the metabolism-based assay (MBA) and the CellSearch
system for CTC enumeration. The study was conducted at the IRCCS-CRO Aviano-National Cancer
Institute and approved by our Institutional Review Board. Informed and written consent was obtained
from all patients and healthy donors before their enrolment, and their clinico-pathological information
was recorded. A total of 31 patients with progressive and measurable mBC, at the start of a new
systemic therapy, without limits to number and kind of previous therapies (hormone therapy,
chemotherapy, targeted therapy) were included. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (ECOG PS) score ≤ 1.
Before starting a new therapy, patients underwent a baseline (T0) blood drawn for CTC evaluation and
routine clinical tests. Another blood sample was collected 3-4 weeks after the beginning of the therapy
(follow-up, T1). Among the 31 enrolled patients, 27 and 26 blood samples were evaluated for the
presence of CTC with the MBA at T0 and T1, respectively, whereas CTC count was evaluable with the
gold standard CellSearch for 22 patients at both time points. Details about reasons for exclusion (e.g.:
insufficient or clotted blood sample, organizational and/or technical failure) are summarized in fig. S3.
Clinical re-evaluation of the disease status was conducted depending on the type and schedule of the
therapy; Standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria were used to

determine patients’ responses to treatment.
Microfluidic platform
Device fabrication. In this work, a microfluidic device was employed for droplet generation, and a
second one for droplet reinjection in order to screen their fluorescence for pH determination and
antibody staining. Each device was made of PDMS bonded to a glass surface, as previously reported27.
Optical setup. The optical setup for measuring droplet fluorescence consisted of an Olympus IX70
inverted fluorescence microscope. A 25mW, 405 nm laser beam was focused with a cylindrical lens
crossing orthogonally the microfluidic channel. Fluorescence signal emitted from droplets was captured
by a 40x objective (Olympus LUCPlanFLN, 40x/0.60), split with dichroic filter and detected through
bandpass filters (579/34; 630/38 e 494/20, 435/20) by Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) (H957-15,
Hamamatsu). Signal went through a transimpedance amplifier with 1V/uA gain and detected by the
acquisition system (National Instruments cRIO-9024, analog input module NI9223) with a 10 μsec
scan rate.
Droplet generation and encapsulation of cells
The emulsification device was used to generate droplets. This device has a flow-focusing junction,
where the aqueous phase (cell suspension) and carrier oil stream meet, and droplet generation occurs
(forming a water-in-oil emulsion). The resulting emulsion flowed off-chip through PTFE tubing (Fisher
Bioblock) connected to the outlet of the device and collected into 1.5ml vial (Eppendorf) placed on an
ice-cold rack (IsoTherm System, Eppendorf). The vial containing droplets was incubated for the
desired incubation time at 37°C. After incubation, droplets were immediately cooled by replacing the
vial on the ice-cold rack and reinjected into the required microfluidic device for subsequent analysis.
Droplet fluorescence screening, data acquisition and control system. Droplets were reinjected into the
emulsion device through PTFE tubing (Fisher Bioblock). The data acquisition system has a 10 μsec
scan rate. The signal output voltage of each droplet was recorded and processed in real time by a Field

Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) card. Droplets with a size within defined range and gated
fluorescence were imaged by synchronous triggering of an LED and a CMOS camera, and (optionally)
sorted with a dielectrophoretic pulse. Data are transferred from the FPGA to the real-time controller
providing a record of images and raw tracks for each run. A custom LabVIEW software allows the
operator to access the picture gallery, evaluate the pictures of droplets to discard droplets that are
empty or containing particles not compatible with the morphology of intact cells (debris).
pH-assay for extracellular acidification measurements
The pH-sensitive fluorescent dye SNARF-5F (Invitrogen) was used to measure the pH of each droplet.
SNARF-5F respond to pH variation undergoing a wavelength shift in the emission spectra. Such pHdependent shifts allow the ratio of the fluorescence intensities from the dye at two emission
wavelengths (580nm and 630nm) to be used for quantitative determination of pH. For each droplet the
ratio of emitted fluorescence intensities at 580 and 630 nm (580/630 ratio) of SNARF-5F is calculated
in real time. As the pH is more acidic, SNARF-5F fluorescence increases at 580 nm while decreases at
630nm. To calibrate the system, Joklik’s EMEM medium titrated at different pH (7.4, 7, 6.5, 6, 5.5 and
5) was added with 4 µM SNARF-5F, emulsified and droplets screened for fluorescence. The
580/630nm ratio were calculated for each pH and plotted against the respective pH, which allowed
constructing a calibration curve.
Cell lines
Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and cultured in DMEM medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, in a humidified
atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells used were detached before confluency, tested for absence of
mycoplasma contamination and validated for short tandem repeat profiling.
Identification of a pH threshold to discriminate CTC from WBC in patient samples
To identify a threshold of extracellular acidification rate (i.e.: pH) able to better discriminate between

CTC and WBC, the ECAR of breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF7), and WBCs was
separately assessed by using the MBA. WBCs were obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy
donors (n = 3), after red blood cell lysis with a 1X FACS lysing solution (BD Pharm Lyse), while
breast cancer cell line (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231), grown as previously described at a confluence of
70-80%, were detached with 1% Trypsin-EDTA. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of
1,000,000 cells/ml in 50 μl of the unbuffered Joklik’s modified EMEM culture medium (Sigma)
containing 2mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 15% Optiprep and 4mM of the fluorescent pH indicator SNARF5F, emulsified as described in the previous section, incubated at 37°C for 30 min and analyzed. All
experiments were performed in triplicate at various cell passages.
CTC detection by the MBA
Blood samples were drawn into K2-EDTA Vacutainer tubes (Beckton Dickinson) and maintained at
room temperature. For each sample, 2.5 ml of blood were analyzed within 2 hours after collection. Red
blood cells (RBC) were lysed with a 1X FACS lysing solution (BD Pharm Lyse) and centrifuged at 200
RCF for 5 min. Thereafter, the nucleated fraction was depleted of CD45-positive WBC and residual
RBC using CD45 and Glycophorin A microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), respectively, and LD separation
columns in a MACS MIDI separator (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The CD45-negative cells were recovered, centrifuged at 300 RCF for 10 min and stained with antiCD45 (BD Horizon Brilliant™ Violet 480, dilution 1:100) and anti-EpCAM (BD Horizon Brilliant™
Violet 421, dilution 1:100) for 25 min at room temperature. After washing the sample with PBS-BSA
0.5%, cells were resuspended in 50 μl of the unbuffered Joklik’s modified EMEM culture medium
(Sigma) containing 2mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 15% Optiprep and 4mM of the fluorescent pH indicator
SNARF-5F (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, cells were single-cell encapsulated in monodispersed
droplets using the droplet microfluidic platform as described in previous section. The emulsion was
collected and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2 for 30 min and then reinjected into the microfluidic

channel for fluorescent reading of pH, CD45 and EpCAM expression, and the acquisition of brightfield imaging of each positive event. Positive events were defined as CD45-negative cells able to
acidify their extracellular environment to a pH lower than 6.4 (MBA-CTC). The number of CTC was
then proportionally adjusted to 7.5mL for an easier comparison to the one reported by the CellSearch
test. This was done by obtaining the total volume of sample analyzed (total volume = droplet volume *
number of droplets analyzed) and doing the proper proportion (MBA-CTC (measured) / volume
analyzed = MBA-CTC / 7.5mL). All evaluations were performed without knowledge of the clinical
status of the patients.
CTC detection by CellSearch
Blood samples were drawn into 10 mL CellSave Preservative Tubes (Menarini) and maintained at
room temperature. Blood samples were sent to Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, processed
and analyzed according to manufacturer’s instruction (13). To quantify the fraction of apoptotic CTCs,
a FITC-conjugated anti-M30 monoclonal antibody was used in conjunction with the standard CTC kit,
for recognizing a neoepitope in cytokeratin 18 (CK18) that becomes available at a caspase cleavage
event during apoptosis, and is undetectable in viable epithelial cells as previously described (41). All
evaluations were performed without knowledge of the clinical status of the patients.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 (version 2.6). Patient and clinical characteristics were
presented as frequency and percentage, median and range, mean and standard deviation (SD), as
appropriate. Comparison of median between groups were performed by Mann-Whitney test and groups
were compared using the Wilcoxon rank test, as appropriate. PFS and OS (time elapsed from enrolment
to disease progression and death from any cause, respectively) were determined by Kaplan–Meier
plots, with data being censored at last follow-up if progression or death had not occurred. GehanBreslow-Wilcoxon test were used to compare the survival curves by CTC detection groups. p < 0.05

was considered significant.
Cut-off determination for ECAR method
Median PFS times and Cox proportional hazard ratios over all possible CTC cut-offs using baseline
data were used to determine the optimal CTC cut-off for the prediction of PFS. The median PFS for the
patients above or below each cut-off was calculated. In addition, the percentage of patients above each
CTC cut-off was calculated. The best cut-off was selected as the one with the highest Cox hazard ratio,
being above the normal background and having at least 40% patients above the cut-off. A CTC count
of 6 or more per 7.5mL of blood is predictive of shorter PFS. The chart showing median PFS for each
cut-off is shown in fig. S4. The cut-off of 6 CTC/7.5mL was determined using only results from the
baseline and PFS as the outcome. Additional analyses have shown that the cut-off for other variable
and time points (OS at the baseline, PFS and OS at 1st follow-up) may differ. In order to show uniform
results and simplify the interpretation, a CTC cut-off of 6 CTC/7.5mL was used for all analyses.
