Abstract
Objective: Frontotemporal Lobe Degeneration (FTLD) and Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases more often considered as a continuum
from clinical, epidemiologic and genetic perspectives. We used localized brain
atrophy to evaluate common and specific features of FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS
patients to clarify this clinical continuum.

Methods: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on structural MRI images to
localize volume alterations of brain regions in group comparisons: patients (20 FTLD,
7 FTLD-ALS, 18 ALS) versus controls (39 CTR) and patient groups between
themselves. We used whole-brain cortical thickness (CT) to assess correlations with
brain volume to propose mechanistic explanations of the heterogeneous clinical
presentations. We assessed whether brain atrophy can explain cognitive impairment,
measured with neuropsychological tests (Frontal Assessment Battery, verbal fluency
and semantic fluency).
Results: Common (mainly frontal) and specific areas of atrophy between FTLD,
FTLD-ALS and ALS patients were detected, on the one hand confirming the
suggestion of a clinical continuum, while on the other hand defining morphological
specificities for each clinical group (e.g. a different cerebral and cerebellar
involvement between FTLD and ALS). CT values suggested extensive network
disruption in the pathological process, with indications of a correlation between white
matter volume and CT in ALS. The correlation between neuropsychological scores
pointed at an important role of the cerebellum, together with frontotemporal regions,
in explaining cognitive impairment at the level of executive and linguistic functions.
Conclusions: We identified common elements that explain the FTLD-ALS clinical
continuum, while also identifying specificities of each group, partially explained by
different cerebral and cerebellar involvement.

Introduction
Frontotemporal Lobe Degeneration (FTLD) represents 5% of all causes of dementia
in subjects over 65 years and has two main clinical presentations: the behavioral

variant (bvFTLD) and the linguistic variant (Primary Progressive Aphasia, PPA). The
behavioral variant can present with disinhibition, agitation, aggressiveness, or apathy,
loss of interest and social isolation, while the linguistic one can present in one of the
three possible forms: non-fluent, semantic or logopenic.1 Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the first and second
motoneuron,2 characterized by fasciculations, cramps, muscular amyotrophy and
signs of pyramidal involvement.3 Despite ALS has always been considered as a
disease with an exclusive neuromuscular involvement, several studies also reported
cognitive impairment, especially of the logical-executive functions.4 FTLD and ALS
may be thought as pathophysiological continuum, with 5% of ALS patients
developing FTLD, and 15% of FTLD patients having a motoneuronal involvement.
Furthermore, family forms combining both diseases have already been described in
literature, where each component was caused by different mutations in different
genes.5 Nowadays, many common features of the two pathologies are known,
however it is hard to predict which patients are prone to develop both aspects of the
clinical continuum.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to exclude secondary causes of
dementia (such as brain masses, strokes or infections) and to detect morphological
findings useful for a correct diagnosis (i.e. selective cortical atrophies). In particular,
voxel based-morphometry (VBM) is a useful method to process structural MRI
images, which allows to detect and localize volume differences of specific brain
structures when comparing groups of subjects or the same group longitudinally.
Several VBM investigations have already demonstrated morphological alterations in
specific areas, such as frontal and temporal lobes, insula and anterior cingulum, in
what has been proposed as the FTLD-ALS continuum.6,7,8,9,10

This study aimed to identify the cognitive and neurostructural deterioration of the
FTLD and ALS clinical continuum by using neuropsychological evaluations and
VBM analysis of brain MRI. In order to do so, we searched for common and specific
characteristic of ALS, FTLD-ALS and FTLD in terms of atrophy location compared
to controls subjects (CTR) and between pairs of groups. Furthermore, we assessed
whether cortical thickness (CT) could explain differences between groups and
propose possible mechanistic interpretation of the different clinical presentations. The
second goal was to assess whether a direct relationship exists between cognitive and
neurostructural deterioration by correlating neuropsychological characteristics of the
entire patient population with volume of specific areas over the entire brain, including
regions not usually considered for this analysis such as the cerebellum.

Methods
Subjects
Fourty-five patients belonging to FTLD-ALS continuum were recruited at IRCCS
Mondino Foundation. Patients were classified in three etiological subgroups
according the most recent diagnostic criteria: FTLD (including bvFTLD11 and PPA12),
ALS13 and FTLD-ALS (see Table 1 for demographic characteristics). A group of
thirty-nine age- and gender-matched CTR was selected as a reference group and
enrolled on a voluntary basis among subjects attending to a local third age university
(University of Pavia, Information Technology course) or included in a program on
healthy aging (Fondazione Golgi, Abbiategrasso). Exclusion criteria comprised at
least one of the following: major psychiatric disorders over the last 12 months,

pharmacologically treated delirium or hallucinations, secondary causes of cognitive
decline (e.g. vascular, metabolic, endocrine, toxic, iatrogenic).
This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki with written
informed consent from all subjects. The protocol was approved by the local ethic
committee of the IRCCS Mondino Foundation.
Neuropsychological assessment
Fourty-two of fourty-five patients (20 with FTLD, 15 with ALS and 7 with FTLDALS) underwent neuropsychological standardized evaluation for investigating the
global cognitive status (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE) and the following
cognitive domains: attention (attentive matrices, trail making test A and B, Stroop
test), memory (digit span, verbal span, Corsi block-tapping test, logical memory,
Rey–Osterrieth complex figure recall, Rey 15 item test), language (verbal and
semantic fluency), executive function (Raven’s matrices, Wisconsin card sorting test,
frontal assessment battery), and visuo-spatial skills (Rey–Osterrieth complex figure).
Neuropsychological scores were corrected by age and education. The cut-off to
identify cognitive impaired patients were defined according to validated criteria in
literature. Two FTLD patients were not capable of performing the neuropsychological
evaluation; 2 FTLD, 1 FTLD-ALS and 1 ALS patients only completed MMSE
assessment. In the present study, only frontal assessment battery (FAB), verbal
fluency (FAS) and semantic fluency (SF) were used in the statistical analysis since
executive and linguistic functions are the core neuropsychological items affected in
the FTD-ALS spectrum.
MRI acquisition
All subjects underwent the same MRI protocol on a Siemens Skyra 3T scanner
(Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32 channel head-coil. A 3D T1-weighted

(3DT1w) structural MPRAGE sequence was setup according to the Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative protocol (ADNI2)14 with the following parameters:
TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.95 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°, 176 sagittal slices,
acquisition matrix = 256 x 256, in-plane resolution = 1.05 x 1.05 mm2, slice thickness
= 1.2 mm, acquisition time = 5.12 minutes. Standard clinical sequences were
performed to exclude other pathologies.
VBM analysis
3DT1w images were converted from DICOM to NIFTI format and segmented in their
native space into grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
using the CAT12 Matlab toolbox for SPM12.15 The segmented images were
normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (ICBM-152) with 1.5
mm isotropic voxels, total intracranial volume (TIV) and the mean CT value over the
whole cortex were assessed with CAT12. The resulting images, i.e. normalized GM
and WM images, were smoothed using a gaussian kernel of 6x6x6 mm3 in SPM1216
and were used as inputs for the statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and neuropsychologic data were compared using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences, SPSS21 (IBM, Armonk, New York), to assess significant
differences between groups. Gaussian distribution was checked with a Shapiro-Wilk
test, then normally distributed variables (age, MMSE and SF) were compared using a
one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction, while non-normally distributed
ones (FAB and FAS) were compared using a Kruskall-Wallis test (Mann-Whitney for
pair comparisons). Gender was compared with a chi-squared test. Two-sided p<0.05
was used as significance threshold.

Each pathological group (FTLD, ALS, FTLD-ALS) was compared voxelwise to the
CTR group using a one-way ANOVA VBM analysis, performed with SPM12, to
identify the atrophic regions of GM and WM specific for each pathologic group. The
same analysis was carried out between pairs of patient groups. In order to assess the
potential functional implications of the atrophic areas, we classified all the altered
voxels based on their spatial overlap with standard resting state networks (RSNs)17.
This final analysis shows which RSNs are likely to be involved in each pathological
presentation (FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS).
SPM12 was also used to perform multiple regression analyses on all subjects to
correlate GM and WM volume with CT values. Moreover, for each
neuropsychological score, a multiple regression analysis was performed on all
patients considered together to determine possible areas responsible for the
distribution of results.
For the one-way ANOVA and CT regression, the significance was set at p<0.05 FWE
corrected at cluster level. Exploratory results were also investigated with an
uncorrected p<0.001 together with a cluster extension correction of minimum 160
voxels. Gender, age and TIV were used as covariates.
The XJVIEW toolbox (http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview/) and FSL anatomical
atlases, such as JHU17,18 and SUIT,19 were used to accurately localize the regions
affected by alterations.

Results
Overall this study was able to identify patterns of involvement of brain areas affected
by atrophy when comparing ALS, FTLD-ALS and FTLD patients with CTR subjects.

Whole brain mean CT was found to correlate with GM and WM volumes, nonnecessarily implicated in group differences.
Correlations of atrophy and neuropsychological scores in the overall patient group
indicated that there were cortical areas key to specific functions, such as the
cerebellum, despite atrophy per se was affecting the cerebellum only in the FTLD
group.
Patient characteristics
Based on clinical criteria, patients were clustered as follow: 20 patients with FTLD
(16 bvFTLD and 4 PPA, 2 logopenic and 2 semantic variant), 18 patients with ALS
and 7 patients with both forms FTLD-ALS. Demographic data and
neuropsychological scores are summarized in Table 1.
Groups were age- and gender-matched while MMSE was significantly reduced only
in FTLD and FTLD-ALS patients with respect to CTR but did not differ between
patient groups (p= 0.214). FAB scores were homogeneous between patient groups
(p=0.160), whereas FAS and SF differed between patient groups (p=0.002 and
p=0.004).
Comparison between patients and controls
Voxelwise comparisons between patients and CTR with regard to brain atrophy are
reported in Table 2. The most compromised group in terms of GM atrophy is the
FTLD group, followed by FTLD-ALS and by ALS. In detail, the atrophic GM regions
in FTLD compared with CTR were mainly located (bilaterally) in the frontal and
temporal lobes (Figure 1). WM also resulted more atrophic in FTLD compared to
CTR in several tracts comprising the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF),

forceps minor (Fm), cingulum gyrus (CingG), anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and
superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF).
The atrophic regions in FTLD-ALS compared with CTR were lateralized to the left
hemisphere and involved the frontal lobe (in particular the frontal and central
opercular cortex (Foc and Coc)) and the left insula of the temporal lobe, also altered
in FTLD. Considering WM, FTLD-ALS compared with CTR, was more atrophic only
in the SLF and the uncinate fasciculus (UF).
ALS did not show any statistically significant atrophic areas compared to CTR. When
lowering the statistical threshold, ALS resulted atrophic compared with CTR only in
the left pre- and post-central gyrus (PcG and PostcG). No significant areas of WM
atrophy were found.
The location of all atrophic voxels with reference to RSN involvement is shown in
Table 3 for the comparison of each patient group to CTR. The ALS group involved
predominantly areas of the sensory motor network (SMN); FTLD-ALS showed
atrophy affecting not only motor functions (e.g. frontal cortex (FCN)), but also other
sensory networks (e.g. the occipital visual network (OVN)), several higher-functions
including working memory (WMN), executive function (ECN) and ventral attention
(LVAN) networks, as well as hippocampal areas belonging to the default mode
network (DMN); FTLD patients presented atrophy involving almost all functional
systems, with a further extensive involvement of the DMN and the cerebellar
network.
Comparison between pathological subgroups
Comparisons between atrophy of different groups of patients are also reported in
Table 2.

Direct comparison between patient groups showed statistically significant differences
when comparing FTLD and FTLD-ALS to ALS patients (Figure 2). FTLD were more
atrophic than ALS in a number of temporal areas including the fusiform gyrus
(FusG), the parahippocampal gyrus (ParahG), the temporal pole (Tp), the inferior and
medium temporal gyri (ITG and MTG) as well as the lateral occipital cortex (inferior)
(LOCi). In WM regions, FTLD showed atrophy compared to ALS in the Fm, ATR,
SLF (regions also atrophic when comparing FTLD to CTR), in the temporal
longitudinal inferior fasciculus (TLIF) and extensively in the posterior cerebellum
(Crus I/II, lobules VII and VIII).
FTLD-ALS subjects in comparison to ALS subjects shared several areas of GM
atrophy that emerged as statistically significant also in the comparison of FTLD to
ALS. These areas involved mainly GM of the temporal lobe.
Comparisons of FTLD versus FTLD-ALS did not survive FWE correction. Trends of
atrophy were explored lowering the statistical threshold. It emerged that in FTLD the
insula is the only area potentially more atrophic than FTLD-ALS. No WM regions
seemed to indicate group specific trends of atrophy between FTLD and FTLD-ALS
and between FTLD-ALS and ALS.
Correlation between atrophy and CT
There were no statistically significant correlations between local atrophy and whole
brain CT that survive correction for multiple comparison. A detailed description of
trends is in the supplementary material.
Overall, in the FTLD group, CT correlated (p<0.001, uncorrected) with GM volume
in the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus (MFG and IFG), superior orbital frontal
gyrus (SOrFG), inferior parietal lobule (InfLob), supramarginal gyrus (SupramG) and
left anterior CingG, whereas CT correlated (p<0.001, uncorrected) with WM volumes

of the forceps major (FM), SLF, IFOF and of WM volumes of regions adjacent to the
IFG and lingula (Ling).
In the ALS group, CT correlated (p<0.001, uncorrected) with GM volume in the
cerebellum (bilateral IX and right VIII areas) whereas CT correlated (p<0.001,
uncorrected) with WM volume in the Fm, UF, IFOF, TLIF and afferent to the insula.
No trends or correlations between CT and volume was found in the FTLD-ALS
group.
Correlation between atrophy and neuropsychological scores
Correlations between neuropsychological scores and volume in all patients are
reported in Table 4.
FAB scores correlated with GM volume in some brain regions, including several
cerebellar areas (left crus I and II, VII and VIII); in the same way the score correlated
with several WM regions, including the cerebellum ones.
Reduced FAS scores had a significant involvement of GM regions of all lobes,
cerebellum and the thalamus. Moreover, FAS correlated with WM volume in
multiples subcortical regions and in numerous cerebellar areas.
Also SF scores correlated with GM volume of frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital and
cerebellar areas, but WM correlation was less extended in comparison to the
aforementioned neuropsychological tests.

Discussion
The main finding of this study supports the clinical continuum of FTLD, FTLD-ALS
and ALS patients given the presence of shared common features. The clinical

continuum was well detected by fluency scores (both FAS and SF), which were the
lowest in FTLD, lower in FTD-ALS and only slight decreased in ALS with respect to
normal scores. The same behavior was detected in volume deterioration: FTLD
presented a diffuse cerebral (bilateral frontotemporal) and cerebellar atrophy, FTLDALS presented a less pronounced cerebral (left frontotemporal) and cerebellar
atrophy, while ALS presented a minimal atrophy (bilateral pericentral).
Interestingly, however, there are clear specificities showing involvement of cognitive
areas and of WM disruption that contribute to explain clinical and neuropsychological
presentations. Common features included more atrophic frontal lobes compared to
CTR. FTLD and FTLD-ALS shared increased atrophy of the temporal lobe compared
to ALS, although in the FTLD-ALS this did not surviving multiple comparisons
correction. It is noteworthy that while areas of GM atrophy were found in all three
groups of patients compared to CTR, WM atrophy was more disease specific, with
extensive involvement in FTLD and some involvement in FTLD-ALS. Cerebellar
differences were particularly marked between FTLD and ALS patient groups; there
were also morphological properties detected by VBM analysis in extensive posterior
cerebellar areas (both in GM and WM) correlating with neuropsychological scores.
Atrophy of frontal and temporal cortices in FTLD patients confirms previous
results.20 Nonetheless the ventromedial and posterior orbital frontal cortex did not
emerge to be more atrophic in these patients as reported in previous studies.21
Considering alterations in WM, there were several regions more atrophic in FTLD
compared to CTR, as shown in Table 2, indicating an overall network disruption that
may be independent or secondary to GM atrophy. The present cross-sectional data
cannot answer mechanistic questions on WM and GM alterations in FTLD patients,

that need to be dealt with appropriate dedicated longitudinal studies where the
interplay of GM and WM involvement can be followed over time.
FTLD-ALS patients, instead, showed lateralized alterations (to the left hemisphere) in
the Foc and Coc, which are located in the frontal lobe, and in the left insula, which are
all GM areas that are also involved in FTLD. Given that the insula has a pivotal role
in cognitive functions (self-perception, motivation, executive functions and subjective
responses) and the anterior insula is connected with dorsolateral and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex22 it is interesting that this brain region is more and bilaterally
atrophic in the FTLD group with worse executive functions. Noteworthy that in
previous studies the insula was proven to be involved in genetic pre-symptomatic
FTLD patients with different genetic mutations.7 Unfortunately, genetic data were not
available for our study and the VBM analysis was not able to differentiate whether the
anterior or posterior part of the insula was most prominently involved. Furthermore,
the FTLD-ALS group showed involvement of some WM regions belonging to the
SLF, also altered in FTLD, as well as of the UF. The SLF and UF are both associative
long tracts that connect different lobes of the brain, with the SLF being known to
contribute to higher motor functions while the UF has a role in memory and
emotional behavior.23 This finding supports the mixed clinical presentation of FTLDALS patients.
In ALS patients, previous studies reported atrophy in non-motor areas involved in
executive and behavioral functions, such as frontal, temporal and limbic regions.24,25
Although our ALS patients did not show statistically significant atrophy when
compared to CTR in those regions, the involvement of motor and premotor regions
emerging from a less stringent statistical analysis is indeed consistent with motor
symptoms onset in ALS.

These results were also captured by the RSN overlap analysis. The ALS group
showed an involvement of the sensory motor network only, while FTLD-ALS had
atrophy spread across sensory and associative networks, including the DMN, although
limited to the hippocampus. In FTLD there was a widespread involvement not only of
sensory and associative networks, but of all cognitive domains including executive
function networks. These three groups of patients can be considered as a clinical
continuum, where subjects belong to one group or the other depending on the domain
affected by tissue atrophy.
All the above was discussed in terms of comparison between patient groups and CTR.
The direct comparison between patients highlighted the clear difference in atrophy of
the temporal lobe between FTLD and ALS, which was also found in the comparison
of FTLD-ALS and ALS, although at a lower statistical threshold. Interestingly, the
comparison of FTLD and ALS highlighted a statistically significant atrophy of the
cerebellum in FTLD, which confirms findings of previous studies in C9orf72 mutated
patients.24,25, 26 Genetic data were not available for our analysis, but it would be
interesting to understand whether cerebellar involvement is gene-dependent.
Moreover, since our FTLD group was mainly represented by the behavioral variant
(16 subjects), we could also hypothesize that cerebellar alterations, which were shown
in this group, are particularly relevant to this disease phenotype. The fact that there
was a significant involvement of the cerebellar Crus I/II (bilaterally) in FTLD
compared to ALS, could partially explain the cognitive impairment of these patients
given the role of this region in memory and language processing27 as well in
continuous cognitive processing tasks.17 Furthermore, our study shows a statistically
significant involvement of the posterior cerebellum in FTLD compared to ALS,
which could point to a greater disruption of the cerebro-cerebellar circuit in FTLD.

This is further supported by the atrophy found in the ATR, which is known to be part
of the efferent pathway from the superior cerebellar peduncle.28
In order to understand the source of atrophy in the three patient groups, we
investigated whether mean CT values were correlated with local or distributed
atrophy as measured by VBM analysis. Although whole brain CT did not survive
multiple comparison when correlated with local volume, trends are interesting and
can help mechanistic interpretation of the VBM results. Indeed, both VBM and CT
are based on cortex morphology, but with CT being more specific to cellular
density.29
Details of the CT correlations with local volumes are given in the supplementary
materials; nevertheless, it is intriguing to consider CT correlations (p<0.001,
uncorrected) with GM and WM volume in each group. Indeed, the different etiology
of these patients brings out some differences in morphological changes that subtend
CT and VBM volumes correlations. In particular, in ALS, CT correlates with GM
volume in the posterior cerebellum, and in particular area VIII and IX, known to be
key to motor control, as well as motor learning and sensory integration. This is
different from previous studies that showed CT correlations with the precentral
cortex, cingulum and insula.31,32 In our cohort, though, CT correlated with extensive
WM areas affecting long tracts connecting main cortical lobes, including the Fm
connecting interhemispheric frontal cortices, the ITLF connecting temporal and
occipital lobes, the UF connecting the limbic system to the temporal and frontal lobes
and the IFOF connecting occipital and frontal cortices. These correlations that emerge
only in ALS patients, indicate that white matter integrity has a key role in preserving
cortical cell density, as measured through CT. Indeed, no correlations were found in
FTLD-ALS, while CT and volume correlated in a number of frontal lobe GM regions

and in only temporal WM in FTLD, supporting the different clinical presentation of
these patients’ groups.
The correlation between neuropsychological scores and brain volume was performed
to elucidate whether the cognitive involvement could be described in terms of atrophy
of specific brain regions. The neuropsychological tests confirmed that FTLD and
FTLD-ALS scored lower than ALS in MMSE, FAS and SF (Table 1). The correlation
between neuropsychological scores and brain volume performed using the VBM
approach for the overall patient group revealed that the structural integrity of the
cerebellum is strongly associated with the FAB score. This result is consistent with
recent literature showing more and more often that the cerebellum has a key role in
cognition and in supporting advanced functions.31,32,17 Furthermore, recent studies
have reported the presence of a high proportion of cerebellar connections with the
frontal and prefrontal cortex29 consistent with the fact that the FAB is thought to
require predominantly frontal and prefrontal cortex and more generally high-level
functions. Indeed, Crus I is known to be involved in cognition, whereas lobule VII has
recently been shown to have a role in cognitive and social behavior, with particular
focus on persisting behavior and novelty seeking.33 Since the cerebellar areas
correlating with FAB are also those resulting more atrophic in FTLD compared to
ALS (i.e. Crus I/II and lobule VII/VIII), it is possible that the correlation between
cerebellar volume and neuropsychological scores is driven by alterations of FTLD
group. Future studies will be able to confirm the generalization of these results for the
FAB test. Our findings also revealed that performances of the verbal fluency test, i.e.
FAS, correlated with atrophy of both frontal areas, consistently with their inhibitory
role, and with mostly bilateral cerebellar areas, including Crus I/II as well as both the
anterior (lobule IV, V, VI) and posterior (lobule VII, VIII and IX) cerebellum.
Interestingly, there is also a correlation with the left thalamus, which is a location of

synaptic relay for the cerebro-cerebellar loop as well as being an important node for
whole brain structural connectivity. The thalamic involvement is not surprising, given
that the most striking outcome of the correlation analysis with the FAS scores is the
widespread involvement of WM areas of the temporal and parietal lobes, supporting
associative functions that are cardinal to this task. The extensive GM and WM
cerebellar involvement can be explained by the amnestic and linguistic roles of Crus
I/II and by the motor involvement of the anterior cerebellum.33, 27 Finally, SF scores
also showed correlations with volume of parietal and temporal regions, classically
involved in language processing. Once again, the cerebellar involvement marks its
importance in functions such as memory and language and confirms its role in
patients belonging to the FTLD and ALS continuum.
These interesting results, however, must be interpreted with caution. The relatively
small number of patients per group, in particular for FTLD-ALS, may have reduced
the statistical power of some analysis, reducing sensitivity to detect significant
differences between patient groups. Nonetheless, it is important to consider that
FTLD and ALS are rare diseases so larger cohorts may be feasible in future multicenter studies. Furthermore, the more disabled patients were not able to perform the
neuropsychological tests, therefore we were able to perform the correlation analyses
only considering the overall group of patients. Finally, the CTR group did not
undergo the neuropsychological examination, therefore limiting the correlation
analysis to the pathological cases. Having CTR scores would be highly desirable for
future studies.

In conclusion, our study assessed morphological alterations of FTLD, FTLD-ALS and
ALS patient groups in the attempt to clarify the substrate of known clinical

differences and their clinical continuum. The involvement of GM areas, to different
extent, in frontal regions in all groups, with atrophy of insular areas in FTLD and
FTLD-ALS patients, and temporal cortices and WM regions in FTLD only, supports
the presence of shared features, but, at the same time, very distinctive characteristics
of these patient groups. Interestingly, cerebellar differences between FTLD and ALS
as well as the cerebellar role in correlations between atrophy and cognitive scores,
indicates that the cerebellum contributes to determining the FTLD or ALS variant of
this continuum. Furthermore, the correlation between CT and local volume of long
WM bundles in ALS, potentially indicates the role of inter-lobe WM integrity for
supporting cognitive functions in ALS. Alterations of CT and temporal WM in FTLD,
instead, is consistent with emotional and cognitive impairment in this group of
patients. Future longitudinal studies are needed to better investigate the relation
between CT, localized atrophy, clinical and neuropsychological outcomes in terms of
mechanisms of the FTLD and ALS spectrum.

gyrus; MFG= middle frontal gyrus; IFG= inferior frontal gyrus; SFG = superior frontal gyrus;
ParacG= paracingulate gyrus; AntCing= anterior cingulus; SubcalG= subcallosal gyrus; Fp =
frontal pole; SubcG= subcallosus gyrus; Parietal lobe: PostcG= postcentral gyrus; SupLob=
superior lobule; SupramG= supramarginal gyrus; AngG= angular gyrus; Temporal lobe:
MTG= middle temporal gyrus; ITG= inferior temporal gyrus; STG= superior temporal gyrus;
Occipital lobe: LatO= lateral occipital; Op= occipital pole; White Matter: Hipp =
hippocampus; IFL = inferior fasciculus longitudinalis; PSLF= parietal superior longitudinal
fasciculus; Tp = temporal pole; Cun= cuneus; Precun= precuneus; PostCing= posterior
cingulus; FM= forceps major; ATR= anterior thalamic radiation; U= uncus.

Figure 1: GM and WM atrophy in patients compared to controls. Regions of grey
matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy in patients compared to controls (CTR).
Significance was set at p<0.05 FWE corrected at cluster level, except for the
comparison ALS and CTR (p<0.001, k>160). All results are overlaid onto the MNI
152 template and are shown as interleaved axial slices. L indicates the left hemisphere
(radiological view). A) GM atrophic regions in FTLD (blue), FTLD-ALS (yellow)
and ALS (red) compared to CTR. B) WM atrophic regions in FTLD (blue) and
FTLD-ALS (yellow) compared to CTR.

Figure 2: GM and WM atrophy between patient groups. Regions of grey matter
(GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy between patients. Significance was set at
p<0.05 FWE corrected at cluster level, except for the comparison FTLD and FTLDALS (p<0.001, k>160). All results are overlaid onto the MNI 152 template and are
shown as interleaved axial slices. L indicates the left hemisphere (radiological view).
A) GM atrophic regions in FTLD vs ALS (blue), FTLD-ALS vs ALS (yellow) and
FTLD vs FTLD-ALS (red). B) WM atrophic regions in FTLD (blue) compared to
ALS.
