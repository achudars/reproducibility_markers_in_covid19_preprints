ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate changes in corneal low and high order aberrations (LOA and HOA),
which cause visual disturbances after lower eyelid epiblepharon repair surgery.
Methods and analysis: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study, which included 108
eyes from 54 patients. Wavefront analyses for calibrated LOAs and HOAs (root mean square,
coma, three-piece aberrations [Trefoil], secondary astigmatisms, and spherical aberrations
[SA]) were performed via a Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer preoperatively, at the first
and second follow-ups (f/u), and at G1, G2, and G3 (<45 days, 45–75 days, and >75 days
post-surgery). Several risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, and corneal keratitis presence)
were assessed.
Results: In LOAs, flat keratometer (K) and axis values decreased significantly from baseline
at the first f/u. At the second f/u, mean K and axis decreased. In HOAs, coma and trefoil
increased from baseline at the first f/u and normalized by the second f/u. SA decreased at the
second f/u and in G3. The various risk factors did not affect postoperative outcomes, axis,
and secondary astigmatisms. After correcting for risk factors, at the first f/u, cylinder, coma,
trefoil, and SA increased significantly from the baseline, while axis and flat K decreased. At
the second f/u, cylinder increased, while axis and mean K decreased significantly from the
baseline.
Conclusion: Epiblepharon repair surgery may impact axis changes. Flat K, coma, and trefoil
may be affected by mechanical force changes immediately following surgery. Mean K and
SA may change with cornea state changes during healing.

INTRODUCTION
Epiblepharon is a congenital eyelid anomaly that more often affects Asian children
than children of other demographics.[1] The prevalence of epiblepharon in the Japanese
population was reported to be 9.9% in children aged 3 months to 18 years.[2] In addition,
epiblepharon comprised 9.5% of the oculoplastic surgery clinical cases in a tertiary care
hospital setting in Singapore.[3] Epiblepharon is defined as a horizontal fold in the
hypertrophied pretarsal orbicularis muscle and redundant skin near the eyelid margin, which
causes the eyelashes to project inwards towards the cornea while the eyelid and tarsal plate
positions remain normal. Epiblepharon is differentiated from congenital entropion, which is
defined as an inward rotation of the tarsus and the lid margin.[4, 5]
Patients with epiblepharon experience photophobia, foreign body sensation, irritating
tearing, and visual disturbances caused by corneal problems.[6] In addition to these
symptoms, astigmatisms are most frequently observed in patients with epiblepharon as
compared with the normal population. For instance, Preechawai et al. reported a high
prevalence of astigmatism in patients with epiblepharon (52.2% had a 1 D or worse
astigmatism).[7] It is thought that the corneal curvature changes in epiblepharon are due to
the mechanical force created by squeezing the eyelids in response to corneal erosion and
abnormal eyelid tension from the hypertrophied pretarsal orbicularis muscle and redundant
skin folds. Several studies have reported a greater prevalence of astigmatism in epiblepharon
patients and changes in astigmatism after reparative surgery.[7-10]
Modern vision research has benefited from wavefront technology, which makes it possible to
measure low- and high-order aberrations, including posterior corneal astigmatisms, with total
cornea curvature via the Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer (Ziemer, Port, Switzerland).
Ray tracing using Snell’s law and pachymetry data with a reference plane in the posterior
corneal surface are used.[11] Furthermore, higher order aberrations (HOAs) from all

refractive errors, such as those that occur with astigmatisms, cannot be corrected by ordinary
glasses or contact lenses. Recently, HOAs have been represented mathematically by
calculating a Zernike coefficient.[12-14] Moreover, corneal transplantation, intraocular lens
(IOL) implantation, pterygium surgery, and scleral buckling result in HOA changes.[15-17]
In HOAs, ‘spherical aberration’ changes are known to result in decreased contrast sensitivity,
halos, and glare, and ‘coma’ changes are associated with tilt and double vision.[18, 19] These
HOAs result in changes that may lead patients to experience a qualitative deterioration in
sight.[18-20]
Given that most epiblepharon patients are children, understanding the visual
impairments caused by surgery is especially critical. The risk for astigmatism and HOAs due
to surgery should be conveyed to patients, and eyeglass prescriptions should be considered.
To our knowledge, although changes in anterior lower order aberrations (LOAs) (sphere and
cylinder) after surgery have been investigated, no studies on the changes in calibrated anterior
and posterior LOAs together with HOAs, including their risk factors, have been conducted.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the preoperative and postoperative
calibration of LOA (anterior and posterior astigmatisms) and HOA changes in the
postoperative period, while adjusting for potential risk factors, such as age, sex, body mass
index (BMI), and corneal keratitis status.

METHODS
Approval for the retrospective review (IRB file No.: DSMC 2019-02-005) of our
patients’ medical data was obtained from the Keimyoung University Dongsan Hospital
Institutional Review Board (IRB), Daegu, Korea. All data and research collection procedures
followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The medical and surgical records of 78 patients (156 eyes) diagnosed with epiblepharon who

underwent epiblepharon repair surgery at Keimyoung University Dongsan Hospital from
January 2016 to January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Due to the retrospective nature
of this study, the IRB waived the requirement for patient consent. All surgeries were
performed by a single surgeon (DCL), who was also involved in the clinical assessment of
the patients. Surgical indications included severe corneal erosions and chronic irritating
symptoms such as epiphora, frequent eye blinking and/or rubbing, and photophobia. Patients
with post-surgery follow-ups of as long as 3 months were included. Patients with congenital
entropion, distichiasis, trichiasis, or a history of ocular and eyelid surgery were excluded. A
total of 48 eyes of 24 patients were excluded from this study.
Preoperatively, all subjects underwent ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected
visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, slit-lamp examinations, and indirect fundus
examinations. In addition, wavefront analyses for calibrated LOAs (anterior and posterior
astigmatisms including keratometry were calibrated in ray-traced mode) and HOAs (root
mean square [RMS], coma, three-piece aberrations [Trefoil], secondary astigmatisms [2nd
Astig], and spherical aberrations [SA]) were measured via a Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug
Analyzer. These analyses were performed by a single technician preoperatively, and at the
first and second f/u in group 1 (less than 45 days post-surgery), group 2 (from 45 to 75 days
post-surgery), and group 3 (more than 75 days post-surgery).

Surgical technique
All surgeries were performed under general anesthesia due to patient age. A mixture
of lidocaine 2% and epinephrine (1:100,000) was injected subcutaneously into the lower
eyelid. Excess lower eyelid skin was grasped with forceps to cause mild ectropion, and the lid
was marked with a pen. The upper skin incision line was approximately 2 mm below the
eyelash line, with a delineated ellipse more lateral than proximal to the punctum. The width

of the ellipse was extended laterally near the lateral canthus to achieve a good contour.
The infra-eyelash skin incision and excision of the pretarsal orbicularis muscle was followed
by suturing of the subcutaneous tissue of the upper skin-muscle flap to the exposed tarsal
plate with three interrupted 6.0 monosyn sutures (medial, center, and lateral) to achieve a
good eyelash contour. Moreover, a Bovie monopolar needle cautery instrument (Colorado
Biomedical Inc, Evergreen, CO) was used for thermal cauterization of the septum to create
adhesions between the preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle and the septum. These adhesions
minimized vertical overriding of the orbicularis oculi muscle at the lower eyelid. If there
were dog-ears at the lateral ends of the incision, the surgeon removed them with a triangular
skin excision. If there were small amounts of pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle and redundant
skin overlying the lower lid margin, the tissue was also removed. At the end of surgery, the
skin was then closed with a continuous 6-0 fast-absorbing plain gut suture. Ocuflox antibiotic
ointment was used on the skin wound for 4 weeks postoperatively and was then tapered
weekly.

Statistical Methods
R language version 3.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
and T&F program version 2.9 (YooJin BioSoft, Korea) were used for all statistical analyses.
Normally distributed variables are expressed as means ± standard deviations, and nonnormally distributed variables are expressed as medians (interquartile range). For categorical
variables, data are expressed as sample numbers and percentages (N [%]).
Paired sample t-tests were used to test for differences in outcomes from pre- to post-operation.
When variables were not normally distributed, Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality tests and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were used to check
the normality of all continuous variables.

Univariable linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the independent effects of
risk factors such as age, sex, BMI, and cornea keratitis presence on continuous outcomes
after surgery. For multivariable analysis, outcomes measured before and after surgery and risk
factors such as age, sex, BMI, and cornea keratitis presence were used as paired dependent
variables and independent variables, respectively, in a linear mixed-effect model. Time and
all risk factors were used as fixed effect covariates with random intercepts across subjects.
Statistical significance was reached when two-tailed p-values were less than 0.05.

RESULTS
A total of 108 eyes of 54 patients were included in the study. Baseline patient characteristics,
as well as the average f/u times, are shown in Table 1.

In terms of corneal HOAs, both coma (D) (p=0.006; Supplementary Fig. 9) and trefoil (D)
(p=0.037; Supplementary Fig. 10) values were significantly higher at first f/u compared to
baseline. No significant differences at any of the post-operative time points, compared to

sex and age affected G2 sphere values. The risk factors assessed did not affect axis values at
any time point.
In terms of HOAs, total RMS and RMS were affected by the presence of cornea keratitis at
the second f/u only. Age affected defocus values at the second f/u in G2 and G3. However, 2nd
Astig was not affected by any risk factors at any time point. Age only affected coma values at
the second f/u and in G1, while sex, age, and BMI affected them in G2. Only sex had an
effect on trefoil values in G3. Finally, age affected SA values in G2 alone.
Next, we analyzed the significance of time as a fixed effect after correcting for the effects of
the risk factors discussed above on the two outcomes (change from baseline values and
univariable regression analysis) measured before and after surgery. To do this, a multivariable
linear mixed-effect model was employed. At the first f/u, cylinder, coma, trefoil, and SA were
significantly increased (p=0.039, 0.008, 0.027, and 0.05), while axis and flat K decreased
(p<0.001, 0.022) from baseline. At the second f/u, cylinder was increased (p=0.05), while
axis and mean K were significantly decreased (p൑0.001 and 0.045) from baseline. In G1,
sphere, axis, and flat K decreased from baseline (p=0.041, <0.001, and 0.028), while
astigmatism increased significantly (p=0.028). In G2, axis decreased from baseline (p=0.001),
while coma increased significantly (p=0.04). In G3, axis, flat K, and SA all significantly
decreased from baseline (p൑0.001, 0.009, and 0.011, respectively).

DISCUSSION
Given the current deficiencies in the understanding of visual impairments caused by surgery
in patients with epiblepharon, this study aimed to investigate post-operative changes in
corneal LOAs and HOAs after lower eyelid epiblepharon repair in chlidren. This surgical
procedure was demonstrated to cause significant changes in axis, flat K, mean K, SA, coma,
and trefoil values.

Many kinds of postoperative visual disturbances due to refractive power changes after ocular
surgery have been reported previously. Specifically, severe or irregular astigmatism, changes
in the astigmatic axis, myopic or hyperopic shifts, changes in axial length, and positional or
dioptric errors in the implanted intraocular lenses have been attributed to visual disturbances
and refractive changes in the postoperative period.[21-26] ‘With-the-rule’ astigmatism occurs
frequently in epiblepharon patients, as the present paper demonstrates.
The prevalence of ‘with-the-rule’ astigmatism has been reported to range from 60.7% to 90.5%
when defined as an axis of astigmatism of 180 ± 15° or 20° minus the cylinder astigmatism
axis.[7-9, 27, 28] Here, we report changes from ‘with-the-rule’ to ‘against-the-rule’
astigmatism from 138.26° to 86.05° at 1st f/u and 85.93° at 2nd f/u. (Fig. 5) Furthermore, flat
K and mean K decreased after surgery in the present study. Astigmatisms in patients with
epiblepharon are thought to result from corneal curvature changes due to the mechanical
force caused by abnormal eyelid tension. This tension is caused by redundant horizontal skin
folds in the hypertrophied pretarsal orbicularis muscle and squeezing or spasms of the eyelids
caused by corneal irritation. On the other hand, Shin et al. found that more severe corneal
involvement in epiblepharon was associated with more astigmatism, which persisted after
corneal erosions healed.[9] Khwarg et al. further reported that greater corneal injury or a
higher number of cilia touching the cornea was correlated with more severe astigmatism. It is
hypothesized that long-term corneal epithelial erosion induces cellular apoptosis and cytokine
release, resulting in tissue remodeling and keratoconus.[29, 30] Per this model, long-term
erosion at the inferior cornea and the mechanical force of the eyelid triggers corneal
remodeling and induces astigmatism.
Over the course of the first two post-operative assessments, a trend was observed for the
decrease in axis, flat K, and mean K values. This may indicate decreased lower eyelid
mechanical force and the presence of cornea keratitis in epiblepharon patients. Vertical

pressure by redundant skin folds in the hypertrophied pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscles on
the cornea may have resulted in horizontal flattening of the cornea, which could explain the
high prevalence of with-the-rule astigmatism in these cases, and flat K change immediately
after epiblepharon repair surgery. Conversely, cylinder values were unaffected by
epiblepharon surgery. Flat K returned to baseline values in G1 and G2, although a significant
drop was observed in G3, and mean K was significantly decreased only at the second f/u. Flat
K was more affected by mechanical eyelid forces, while mean K was more affected by
corneal erosion.
Correcting for the effects of multiple risk factors (age, sex, BMI, and cornea keratitis
presence) on post-surgical outcomes using a multivariable linear mixed-effect model revealed
increased cylinder and a significantly decreased flat K at the first f/u. Cylinder and mean K
were also significantly different from baseline at the second f/u. This may be because
cylinder and keratometry were slightly affected by epiblepharon repair surgery after
correcting for LOA risk factors. Given that we used the Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug
Analyzer to correct for both anterior and posterior astigmatisms, the present study may more
accurately reflect pre- to post-epiblepharon surgery topography changes than simulated
keratometry approaches that were used previously. Previous studies have reported astigmatic
amblyopia in 6-9% of epiblepharon patients.[7, 28] Therefore, in children who have
undergone surgical procedures such as epiblepharon repair or strabismus surgery, close
monitoring of any refractive changes in the postoperative period is crucial in preventing the
development of amblyopia.
HOAs are generally an index of visual quality, including in children.[31] As ocular
aberrations increase during development, visual disturbances including distortion and the
appearance of glare and halos may occur. However, correction of HOAs improves contrast
sensitivity and visual quality. For instance, previous work has found that total HOAs decrease

significantly after epiblepharon repair surgery. Critically, the correlation between reduced
corneal staining grade and decreased total HOAs may inform the timing of surgery in
children without specific visual disturbance and photopobia.[32] However, the present study
found that coma and trefoil were significantly increased after epiblepharon repair surgery at
the first f/u, and normalized by the second f/u rather than being decreased, supporting
previous results.[32] In fact, we found that only SA decreased at the second f/u (especially in
G3). Notably, HOAs cannot be corrected by ordinary glasses or contact lenses. Therefore,
this indicates that correcting a lens with an astigmatism about 10 days after surgery may not
be optimal. About 2 months after epiblepharon surgery may be the optimal time to use
correcting lenses.
When accounting for multiple risk factors using a linear mixed-effect model, changes induced
by surgery, coma, trefoil, and SA were increased at the first f/u. However, these measures
returned to baseline by the second f/u. In G2, only coma increased relative to baseline, while
in G3, only SA decreased relative to baseline. This means that coma and trefoil might be
affected by the immediate mechanical force changes after surgery, while SA was affected by
cornea healing post-operation, especially more than 75 days after surgery.
Recent studies have found that HOAs were significantly more common in patients with dry
eye syndrome than in those with healthy eyes,[33,34] and total ocular HOAs were
significantly more common in those with dry eyes and central superficial punctuate keratitis
than in those with dry eyes alone.[35] Ocular dryness and eye conditions may have a large
effect on the outcomes reported here, as indicated by prior studies on HOAs.[33-35] In this
study, we found that HOAs generally increased after epiblepharon repair and then almost
immediately returned to baseline values. However, these post-surgical results likely vary
depending on eye management with hyaluronic acid and other variables such as eye dryness.
We were limited by an inability to assess tear film break up time (TBUT) due to the

retrospective nature of the present study. It is suggested that future studies consider
controlling for this variable when assessing outcomes following epiblepharon surgery.
An additional limitation of the present study was the small sample size, which makes it
difficult to generalize our results to a broader range of clinical populations. Future
prospective studies with larger numbers of patients for postoperative eyelid changes
following epiblepharon surgery are needed. Future studies should also investigate the factors
that may lead to high levels of aberrations, such as dry eye syndrome and cornea erosion state
by using non-clinical (e.g., animal) models.
In conclusion, epiblepharon repair surgery may result in a shift from ‘with-the-rule’ axis
changes to ‘against-the-rule’ axis changes. Additionally, flat K, coma, and trefoil were
affected by mechanical force changes immediately following surgery. Mean K and SA may
also change with cornea state changes in the postoperative period, including corneal erosion
healing.
