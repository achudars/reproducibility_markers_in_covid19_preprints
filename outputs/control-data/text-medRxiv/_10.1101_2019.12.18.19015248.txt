Strongyloides stercoralis was measured in 0–12-year-

60

Prevalence of antibodies to

61

olds using a bead-based immunoassay before and after ivermectin mass drug

62

administration (MDA) for scabies in the Solomon Islands. Seroprevalence was

63

9.3% before and 5.1% after MDA (p = 0.019), demonstrating collateral benefits

64

of scabies MDA in this setting.

Introduction:

92

Strongyloides stercoralis, is unique among soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) in

93

its ability to complete its life cycle within the human host.

94

is most commonly asymptomatic but may be associated with eosinophilia,

95

fatigue, diarrhoea and occasionally larva currens [1]. People with compromised

96

immune systems are at risk of potentially fatal hyperinfection syndrome [1].

97

Albendazole or mebendazole are effective against other major STH species and

98

have been incorporated into mass drug administration (MDA) programs for

99

public health purposes. However, these drugs have limited efficacy for

S. stercoralis infection

100

strongyloidiasis, for which ivermectin is the first-line agent.

101

MDA with ivermectin is used widely to control a number of neglected tropical

102

diseases (NTDs), including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and, most

103

recently, scabies [2,3], but has so far not been adopted for

104

Given the drug’s broad anti-parasitic effect MDA with ivermectin may have as a

105

collateral benefit the population-level control of

106

stercoralis control has been facilitated by serological assays that detect

107

antibodies against the NIE antigen, which is present in infective L3 larvae [4]

108

These antibodies likely indicate current or recent infection [5] and have high

109

sensitivity and specificity compared to stool examination[4]. The NIE antigen has

110

been adapted for use in the Luminex platform, allowing

111

populations using dried blood spots [6].

In the context of a community-randomized trial evaluating the addition of

Islands, we measured the prevalence of antibody responses to the

Methods:

119

The trial of MDA for scabies and impetigo has been described elsewhere [7].

120

Briefly, selected communities in Malaita province in the Solomon Islands were

121

randomised to MDA with open label ivermectin or ivermectin plus azithromycin.

122

All residents of these communities were eligible to participate. In both trial arms,

123

all participants were examined for scabies and offered a single oral dose of

124

ivermectin (200 μg/kg of body weight). People with a contraindication to

125

ivermectin (pregnancy, breast-feeding, or weight <15 kg) were offered topical

126

permethrin instead. Those in whom a clinical diagnosis of scabies was made at

127

baseline were given a second dose of ivermectin 7–14 days later. Written

128

informed consent was obtained from adults and from a parent or guardian of

129

each child aged under 18 years. Assent was also obtained from children who

130

were able to provide it. The study was approved by the London School of

131

Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, the Solomon Islands National

132

Health Ethics Committee and the Atoifi Adventist Hospital Ethics Committee. The

133

main trial was prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02775617).

134

CDC staff did not interact with study participants or have access to identifying

135

information.

136

137

For the sub-study reported here, we collected dried-blood spots (DBS) from all

138

children aged less than 13 years at the baseline and 12-month surveys. We used

139

a fluorescent bead-based assay to test for antibodies against the recombinant

140

NIE antigen [6]. Briefly, serum was incubated with microspheres conjugated to

141

NIE, beads were washed to remove unbound immunoglobulin (Ig), and then

142

bound anti-NIE antibody was detected using biotinylated anti-human IgG+IgG4

143

antibody followed by streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Plates were run on a Luminex-

144

200 (Austin, TX USA) and results reported as median fluorescence intensity with

145

background subtracted. We used a receiver operating characteristic curve

146

analysis to determine cut-offs for seropositivity.

147
148

We conducted a before and after analysis to determine the effect of the MDA on

149

prevalence of antibodies to

150

against

151

analysis. We calculated the seroprevalence of

152

months, and the absolute and relative reduction at twelve months, along with

153

associated confidence intervals and statistical tests of significance. Statistical

154

analysis was conducted in R 3.4.2 (Vienna, Austria).

Results:

159

In total, 1,291 people, including 553 0–12-year-olds were recruited and offered

160

treatment for scabies at the time of the baseline survey. We collected DBS from

161

539 of these children, representing more than 97% of children enrolled in the

162

trial. At the 12-month follow-up, 1,085 individuals (including 479 0–12-year-

163

olds) were seen, and we collected DBS from 448 children (94%). At baseline,

164

9.3% of the children were seropositive for antibodies to NIE, with a range across

165

the six study communities of 2.2% to 14.3% (Table 1). At the 12-month follow-

166

up, the overall prevalence had declined to 5.1% with a range across the

167

communities of 2.1% to 6.7%. The absolute difference in prevalence between

168

baseline and 1 year was 4.2% (95% CI 0.7–7.5%) and the relative reduction was

169

45% (p = 0.019) The seroprevalence of antibodies to NIE was lower at the

170

follow-up visit than at baseline in all communities (Table). Neither the baseline

171

seroprevalence nor the magnitude of change following MDA was higher in

172

communities with a higher baseline prevalence of scabies where more

173

individuals would have received two doses of ivermectin at baseline (Table).

174

175

Discussion:

176

Our study adds to the limited available data on the impact of ivermectin MDA on

177

S. stercoralis prevalence. In the Northern Territory of Australia, a single round of

178

MDA with ivermectin reduced

179

to 5% at 6 months, and a second MDA at month 12 further reduced the

180

seroprevalence to 2% at month 18 [8]. In Ecuador, the prevalence of

181

fell from 6.8% to zero following multiple rounds of MDA conducted for the

182

purpose of onchocerciasis elimination[9]. We showed that in 6 communities in

183

Malaita, Solomon Islands, there was a decrease in seroprevalence of anti-NIE

184

antibodies one year after a single ivermectin MDA conducted for the purpose of

185

scabies control.

189

Had we combined serology with other tests such as Kato-Katz or PCR on stool

190

specimens, we may have detected more cases. We were, however, consistent in

191

the measurement of exposure at both time points so are confident in the relative

192

change observed. As complete seroreversion of anti-NIE responses after

193

treatment may take more than one year[5], and it is not clear that all anti-NIE

194

positive individuals will serorevert [6], it is possible that we have under-

195

estimated the community-level effect of the intervention. Our study was not

196

powered to detect changes in seroprevalence in each individual community, and

197

although the changes were not statistically significant, there were declines in

198

seroprevalence in every community, consistent with our overall study finding.

Data on the prevalence and distribution of STHs in the Solomon Islands are

roundworm are common [10]. The baseline seroprevalence of

203

12-year-olds in the current study was 9.3%, which is broadly similar to

204

prevalence of other STH species reported in the Solomon Islands [10]. Current

205

national deworming guidelines for the Solomon Islands are based on MDA with

206

albendazole, which is likely to have little or no impact on

207

Integrated strategies combining albendazole with ivermectin may therefore be

208

beneficial for control of

209

against several STH species and allowing simultaneous control of scabies, which

210

is highly endemic in the region [3,7]. The current requirement for two doses a of

211

ivermectin, a week apart, for scabies MDA may represent a logistical barrier to

212

integration as single-dose treatment is effective against

213

anti-parasitic drugs such as moxidectin show promise as single-dose treatment

214

for scabies, strongyloidiasis and other STH [12,13].

Two previous studies showed that hookworm, whipworm and

S. stercoralis [11]. Newer

215

S. stercoralis is endemic in the Solomon Islands and

216

We have demonstrated that

217

added to the limited data demonstrating that ivermectin MDA, here conducted

218

for the purpose of scabies control, can also reduce

219

These data highlight ancillary benefits that can be conferred by NTD control

220

programmes and suggest that STH programmes in this region may benefit from

221

the addition of ivermectin alongside albendazole

S. stercoralis seroprevalence.
