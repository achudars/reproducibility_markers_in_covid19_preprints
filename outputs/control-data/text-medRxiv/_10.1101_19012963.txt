ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the reliability and predictive utility of a time-efficient cognitive development chart that seeks to identify children and adolescents with high-risk for multiple outcomes such
as mental health problems, substance use, and educational difficulties.
Method: We analyzed data from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort for Psychiatric Disorders (HRC), a
longitudinal school-based study conducted from 2010-2011 to 2013-2014. Participants were 2,239
children and adolescents, 6 to 17 years of age, who completed the cognitive assessment at baseline.
The task used to track cognitive development was the Two Choice Reaction Time task (<3 minutes
of duration, computer-based), which assesses the accuracy and speed of perceptual decisionmaking. Mental health, substance use, and educational outcomes were assessed by validated standardized methods. Key variables were measured at baseline and 3-year follow-up. The predictive
utility was assessed using static (deviations from the age-expected performance at baseline) and
dynamic (deviations from the age-expected change in performance over time) indicators.
Results: The reliability of the task parameter was high (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.8).
Static indicators of cognitive development significantly predicted concurrent mental, intellectual
and educational difficulties, as well as incident and persistent educational difficulties and substance
use in the 3-year follow-up. Dynamic indicators predicted persistent mental health problems.
Conclusion: Primary-care and mental health professionals need a time-efficient tool for tracking
deviations from age-expected cognitive development, which predicts multiple unwanted outcomes
at the same time. If replicated, future results could support the generation of tools for tracking risk
for mental health, substance use, and educational difficulties.

INTRODUCTION
Tracking physical health through normative growth charts is a routine component of pediatric care
and have proved valuable in the early identification of health problems. Tools such as the World
Health Organization (WHO) Growth Chart standards quantify the adequacy of growth under optimum conditions and exposure to few if any risk factors.1 It became worldwide adopted due to it’s
inexpensive, safe, low-training-requirement properties and easy-to-interpret graphical interface.
However, there are no universally implementable tools for routinely tracking cognitive development. The available ones have problems.2–7 They assess participants of a limited age range, are costly, culturally bound, complex in administration and scoring, or possess limited data on predictive
validity. Given primary-care and mental health professionals are interested in overall healthy development and not on preventing specific disorders/situations, there is a great need for time-efficient
tools that can predict multiple outcomes at the same time. A recent meta-analysis found the average
primary-care physician consultation to range in duration from 48 seconds in Bangladesh to 22.5
minutes in Sweden; 18 countries reported mean consultation lengths of 5 minutes or less.8 These
facts underscore the need for brief screening tools with predictive validity.
Cognitive abilities predict many real-world outcomes, including education, occupation, and income9, social functioning10, physical and mental health outcomes11. Processing speed may represent
one of the best predictors of overall cognitive abilities12. It has been longitudinaly linked to the development of resoning13 and it is much related to cognitive efficiency14. It can be assessed through a
choice reaction-time task for simple decisions (e.g. the direction towards which an arrow points to),
generating measures of response times and accuracy. This 3-minutes task has been used in psychopathology research15 to estimate cognitive and neural processes, making it suitable for routine
screening in primary care and mental health settings. The current study describes the use of this
task.

As far as we know no studies have showed mental health, substance use and educational outcomes
predicted altogether using a unique screening 3-minutes task mapping cognitive efficiency. This
study has three objectives: (1) to test the short-term reliability of a Cognitive Development Chart
constructed to investigate processing efficiency in school-age children and adolescents; (2) to investigate if deviations from age-expected performance derived from the chart (static prediction) are
associated with concurrent and future mental health problems, substance use and educational difficulties, and (3) to investigate if deviations from age-expected change in performance from baseline
to follow-up (rate of change, dynamic prediction) derived from the chart are associated with the
same outcomes.

METHODS
Study design and participants
The Brazilian High-Risk Cohort for Psychiatric Disorders is a large longitudinal school-based study
investigating typical and atypical developmental trajectories of psychopathology and cognition.
From a screening phase including 9,937 biological parents of children aged 6 to 15 years registered
at 57 schools in two Brazilian cities (Porto Alegre and São Paulo) interviewed with the Family History Screen16, we selected two sets of subjects to be further evaluated in the baseline assessment
(2010-2011). One recruited using a random selection (representative of the community, n=958) and
the other using a high-risk selection procedure (subjects at increased risk for mental disorders based
on family members’ and children’s symptoms, n=1,553) totalizing 2,511 subjects. We also conducted a 3-year follow-up with an 80% retention rate (wave 1, 2013-2014). For the present analysis, the
sample was comprised of 2,239 subjects who completed the cognitive assessment at baseline. The
Ethics Committee of the Universidade de São Paulo and Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do
Sul approved the study. More details have been published elsewhere.17

Measures
Cognitive Assessment
Two-choice Reaction Time task (2C-RT), was the main task used to track cognitive development.
The task is significantly associated with age (Figure S1) and it is the shortest task used in our cognitive battery. It measures the speed/accuracy to discriminate the direction (left/right) to which an
arrow is pointing at, on the computer screen (100 trial with equal probabilities).18 Data on mean
reaction time and accuracy were used as input for an EZ-diffusion model function (Figure 1), from
here.19 This model assumes that a decision is made through the accumulation of noisy evidence
about a stimulus over time until one of the response criteria is reached. The most relevant parameter
from the model is the drift rate (v), which reflects the processing efficiency to discriminate a stimulus (high number means better processing efficiency). This measure has been associated with several forms of psychopathology.15 Therefore, it was the chosen parameter for developing our chart.
Additionally to the static assessment, the rate of change of processing efficiency was also calculated
- parameter from follow-up minus baseline divided by the number of years between. Processing
efficiency is expressed in processing efficiency units (PU), which is a standardized score using the
typically developing children as the reference group.
Conflict Control task (CCT) is very similar to 2C-RT, but it includes a second inhibitory component.18 This task included 75 congruent trials when participants had to indicate the actual green arrows’ directions, in addition to 25 incongruent trials when participants had to respond in the opposite direction of red arrows. The EZ-diffusion model processing efficiency component of congruent
trials of CCT was used to assess the 2C-RT short term test-retest reliability. In half of the children,
the task was administered before the 2C-RT and half of them after the 2C-RT.

Outcomes
Mental health and educational outcomes were assessed by validated standardized interviews and
tests performed by trained psychologists and speech therapists.
Mental Health Assessment
•

Child psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using the Brazilian version of the Development
and Well-being Assessment20, a structured interview with items based on the DSM-IV-TR.
At baseline, only the primary caregiver answered the instrument; in wave 1, the parental interview was complemented with a child semi-structured interview on internalizing disorders.
Both responses generate an initial computerized diagnosis that can be confirmed, refuted or
altered by trained child psychiatrists who ascertain final diagnoses. A second child psychiatrist rated a total of 200 interviews from the study, which resulted in a high inter-rater
agreement (k-value=0.80, expected agreement=54.6; rater agreement=90.95).17 For this
analysis, we used only any mental disorder category (Table S1).

•

Underdeveloped intellectual abilities were defined as an intelligence quotient below 80, estimated according to the Tellegen and Briggs method21 and vocabulary and block design
subtests of the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children, third edition – the only existing
Brazilian version till 2010.22 This measure was only available at the baseline assessment.

Substance Use
•

Current substance-use: questions about the past 12 months' use of alcohol, tobacco, shoe
glue, solvents, crack, cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy, acids, amphetamines, steroids or other
recreational drugs were presented to the child at wave 1. This variable was defined as "present” if the participant answered positively to any substance-use over the past 12 months.

Educational outcomes
•

Academic difficulties were assessed by certified speech therapists with the reading (recognition of 70 isolated words) and writing (34 isolated words in dictation) subtests of the Brazilian School Performance Test.23 Reading time was also recorded. On wave 1, the test was abbreviated (61 words from reading and 13 from writing subtests) to only include highly informative items, selected using Item Response Theory.23 On both assessments, a
unidimensional confirmatory factor analysis model (CFA) with each of these dimensions
was built, and individuals' standardized factor scores were saved regressing out the effects of
age and gender. This score was then converted to centiles and defined as reading or writing
difficulty if the subject's centile was below 5% and as reading speed difficulty if the subject´s centile was above 95%.

•

School achievement was assessed by the items about school performance of the Brazilian
Portuguese version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for ages 6 to 1820 completed by
the caregiver. Participants were scored as failing, below average, average, and above average in the following academic subjects: Portuguese or literature, history or social studies,
English or Spanish, mathematics, biology, sciences, geography, and computer studies. A
composite score with these items was derived from saved standardized factor score from an
unidimensional CFA described elsewhere.24 The factor score was converted to centiles and
declared as school achievement difficulty if the subject’s centile was below 5%.

•

Difficulty in educational performance reflects any difficulties in reading accuracy, reading
speed, writing accuracy and school achievement previously described.

•

Reading comprehension was assessed by asking the participant to read a school text of general knowledge without time limitation and answer orally to ten text comprehension questions.25 The trained evaluator rated accuracy. An unidimensional CFA model with these

items was fitted and individuals' standardized factor scores were saved regressing out the effects of age and gender. This score was then converted to centile and defined as reading
comprehension difficulty if the subject’s centile was below 5%. This variable was assessed
only at the follow-up.
Other Assessments
To generate the task parameters from the 2C-RT in typically developing children, we selected children not exposed to well-known risk factors for mental health problems and educational difficulties,
which were assessed as described below.
•

Exposure to Child Abuse/Neglect was evaluated by asking both, caregiver and children, the
frequency of lifetime physical neglect and physical, emotional and sexual abuse. A CFA was
built and the factor scores were used to determine the presence/absence of trauma exposure
as described in detail elsewhere.26

•

Exposure to prenatal and perinatal risk factors were evaluated asking the parental respondent at how many gestational weeks the child was born, the frequency at which the mother
smoked during the pregnancy and if someone else smoked near her during that period.

•

Socioeconomic status was evaluated according to the Associação Brasileira de Empresas de
Pesquisa criteria from 2009. We merged classes A and B into a high status, C into a medium
status, and D and E into a low socioeconomic status.

•

The current parental psychiatric diagnosis was assessed by applying the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview27 to the respondent (biological mother in 92% of the cases). An
‘any mental disorder’ variable was created encompassing any anxiety, mood, substance use
disorder, psychosis or ADHD.

Data Analysis
Reliability analysis
To estimate test-retest levels, we compared the processing efficiency diffusion model-components
from the 2C-RT and the congruent trials of the CCT, which use identical stimuli. The Bland-Altman
method28 was used for analyzing the agreement between the measures by constructing limits of
agreement which are calculated using the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the differences
between the two measures. It is recommended that 95% of the data points should lie within ± 1.96
SD of the mean difference. The lower the range between these two limits the better the agreement
is. Additionally, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated using a two-way mixed
effect (agreement, average-measures) from the irr package version 0.84.29 ICC ranges from 0 (low)
to 1 (high) indicating test-retest similarity.
Deriving the Cognitive Development Chart
Participants were split into a typically developing sample (n=196) and a validation sample
(n=2043). The typically developing sample was composed of randomly-selected participants from
the community, pertained to medium to high socioeconomic status, born after 37 gestational weeks,
without exposure to abuse, neglect, gestational smoke, and with no personal, or parental history of a
mental disorder. We aimed to assess cognitive development in the absence of known risk factors for
psychopathology, a strategy also used in WHO growth charts.1
Age-standardized curves of cognitive development were generated at baseline and follow-up using
age as an independent variable and processing efficiency as a dependent variable in a Generalized
Additive Model (GAM, from gamlss R package, version 5.1-2).30 Next, we tested linear, quadratic
and cubic terms and selected the best-fit ones according to the lowest scores of Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) and Schwartz Bayesian Criterion (SBC). The best-fitting GAM to the training sample was the linear model (SBC = -1872, AIC = -1881) compared to quadratic (SBC = -1867, AIC =

-1880) and cubic (SBC = -1865, AIC = -1879) terms. Lastly, we extracted the predicted values in
the validation sample and standardized it using the parameters from the typically developing sample.
Testing associations with mental health and educational outcomes
Deviations based on the standardized centiles were used as independent variables to predict concurrent and 3-year outcomes. Logistic regression and signal detection analyses were performed, investigating the saved predicted probabilities for each centile of the processing efficiency variable. All
analysis were conducted in R version 3.5.1, including cutpointr package version 0.7.4.31

RESULTS
Overall, at baseline, our sample was equally distributed according to sex. It had a mean age of 10
years and was derived from mid-level socioeconomic-status households. One-fourth of the participants were diagnosed with a mental disorder and one-seventh were classified as having difficulties
in educational performance at baseline and one-third used any substances at follow-up (Table 1). As
expected, processing efficiency increased with development (Figure S2, panel A).

Test-retest reliability
The ICC indicates moderate-to-good short-term test-retest reliability (0.80, IC95% 0.70-0.86, Figure 2, panel B). Similarly, the mean difference (-0.0012), the narrow limits of agreement of the processing efficiency component on the Bland-Altman plot and the low rate of change per-year (mostly
around ± 0.5 z-scores) suggest very-good agreement (Figure S3-4).

Predicting probabilities of negative outcomes using the Cognitive Development Chart
Static predictions
Concurrent associations
At baseline, deviations from age-expected performance were associated with any mental disorder
(Table S2, OR=0.89, 95%CI 0.81-0.97, p=0.008), underdeveloped intellectual abilities (OR=0.61,
95%CI 0.53-0.70, p<0.001) and educational-performance difficulties (OR=0.66, 95%CI 0.59-0.75;
p<0.001). Participants with -2 and +2 z-scores on the curve had the following predicted probabilities: any mental disorder, 35% and 25%; underdeveloped intellectual abilities, 19% and 1%; and
educational-performance difficulties, 25% and 5% (Figure 2, Panel A).

Future outcomes
Deviations from age-expected performance at baseline significantly predicted incident difficulties in
educational performance (Table S3, OR=0.57, 95%CI 0.50-0.65, p<0.001), difficulties in reading
comprehension (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.37-0.50, p<0.001) and substance-use (OR=0.62, 95%CI 0.560.69, p<0.001). Besides, performance on the task also predicted the persistence of educational difficulties (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.32-0.57, p<0.001). Participants with -2 and +2 z-scores on the curve
had the following predicted probabilities: incident difficulties in educational performance, 30% and
5%; persistent educational difficulties, 90% and 25%; difficulties in reading comprehension, 30%
and 1% and substance-use 50% and 10% (Figure 2, Panel B).

Dynamic predictions
Deviations from the age-expected change in task performance over time significantly predicted the
persistence of mental disorders (OR=0.5, 95%CI 0.26-0.94, p=0.03). Participants with a change of 14

1 and +1 z-scores per-year on the curve had 61% and 28% of predicted probabilities for persistent
mental disorder (Figure 3). The signal detection analysis of these results can be found at Table S4-7.

DISCUSSION
This study describes the creation and validation of a screening tool, the Cognitive Development
Chart, for use by primary-care and mental health professionals seeking to identify children and adolescents with ongoing or risk for future mental health, substance use, and educational difficulties.
The chart demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability and predictive utility for tracking many
important aspects of children’s development.
Current methods for tracking mental health and cognitive risk utilize a piecemeal approach. In the
mental health field, most work investigating screening tools focuses on symptom scales, such the
Pediatric Symptom Checklist, CBCL, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.3–5,7,20 Such
scales effectively identify risk for mental disorders. However, they fail to quantify the continuous
age-related changes in developmental competencies and often rely on parental reports, which can
reduce accuracy through parental psychopathology or confirmation, and social desirability biases.
Moreover, the tools require some time to complete, and focus primarily on problems in the mental
health domain.
In the educational field, most tools assess literacy directly through measures, such as the Dynamic
Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS)32, and the Computer-based Phonologic Awareness Screening and Monitoring Assessment (Com-PASMA)6. While useful, these tasks have limitations. For example, the DIBELS can have floor effects that compromise predictive ability32, while
the Com-PASMA only targets preschoolers. Recently, brain function measures (neuroimage and
cognitive tasks) had been studied through a growth chart analysis providing a novel approach for
constructing biomarkers for mental health relevant conditions.33–35 However, these and other cogni-

tive tasks can be time-consuming (with at least one-hour testing) with complex administration requirements.
The Cognitive Development Chart described in the current report may provide a cost and timeeffective, easy-to-acquire, and reliable cognitive measure that could complement the growth monitoring routine. Many primary-care and mental health professionals fail to use currently-available
mental-health screening tools.36 The availability of time-efficient measures could address the need
for scalable tools37 that support the broad dissemination of effective practices. Unlike currentlyavailable ones, this new measure generates predictive information on risk for multiple adverse outcomes, including mental disorders, substance use and difficulties in educational performance. Also,
the results are in line with other studies associating processing speed with psychopathology38 and
academic difficulties.13,14 Finally, given the widespread adoption of the WHO standard curves, this
strategy might be particularly interesting and scalable to build informed health care systems.
This study has some limitations. First, longitudinal trajectories were estimated using two-time
points with an average of 3-years between them and with multiple subjects’ ages. It is unclear
whether measures over shorter periods would have similar predictive abilities. Second, the analysis
was limited to one cohort and still needs to be determined whether results would replicate in less
controlled settings. Third, reliability analysis were performed using distinct tasks in a short period.
However, using distinct tasks constitutes a conservative bias since it is unlikely reliability would be
lower using the same task. Nevertheless, this study has important strengths. First, we took advantage of a very simple tool, with a low interviewer effect, which was able to predict multiple outcomes, such as mental health problems, substance use and educational difficulties in a large sample
of children. Second, a more dynamic measure of development (rate of change) also predicted negative mental health outcomes, which support this measure as an overall tracking tool for a variety of
problems in school-age children.

CONCLUSION
We described an efficient screening method, which efficiently identifies children with concurrent
mental health problems and high risk for future substance use and educational problems. If replicated, these results could inform attempts to track mental health and cognitive development using a
scalable strategy that identifies children likely to benefit from selective prevention efforts.

Notes: The training sample was composed of randomly-selected participants from the community, born after
37 gestational weeks, without exposure to abuse, neglect, gestational smoke, with no personal or parental history of a mental disorder and that pertained to medium to high socioeconomic status. Difficulties are defined as
being below the 5th centile in each task. Reading Comprehension Test and Recent Substance Use were only
evaluated at follow-up. An expanded version of this table, with sub-diagnosis and educational subcategories, is

Figure 1: EZ-diffusional model components

Note: This model considers speed and accuracy simultaneously. Non-decision time represents the
encoding and motor response time; boundary separation, the amount of information needed before
making a decision (response caution style); and drift rate, the average rate of evidence accumulation
within a trial.

Notes: PU against age, with colors representing z-scores. The child PU is plotted against his/her age to locate the z-score
position. With this position is possible to estimate the probability of concurrent or future mental health, substance-use or
educational outcomes by checking the predicted probabilities of these outcomes (Figures 2-3).
