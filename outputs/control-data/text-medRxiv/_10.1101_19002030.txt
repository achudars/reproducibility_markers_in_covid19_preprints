Abstract

15

St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a mosquito-borne reemerging flavivirus in

16

Argentina. It is currently necessary to develop specific serological tests that can

17

efficiently discriminate the flaviviruses that circulate in our country. The immunoassays

18

to diagnose SLEV lack specificity because they are based on the detection of structural

19

viral proteins and the human immunoglobulins produced during infection against these

20

proteins cross-react with other flaviviruses. Here, we describe an enzyme-immunoassay

21

designed to detect human IgG antibodies specific to the viral nonstructural protein NS5.

22

The results indicate that NS5 is a promising antigen useful to discriminate SLEV from

23

other circulating flaviviruses.

Manuscript

28

St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a Flavivirus (Flaviviridae family) transmitted by

29

Culex spp. mosquitoes to birds, humans and other vertebrates are incidental hosts(1). In

30

Argentina, SLEV is a re-emerging arbovirus broadly distributed with the potential to

31

give rise to epidemics of human encephalitis. The symptoms of infection in humans

32

ranged from a simple febrile headache to meningoencephalitis, and the severity of the

33

symptoms increases with the patient age (1-5). Cross-reactivity in diagnostic assays

34

between SLEV and other flaviviruses complicates differential diagnosis(6). This is

35

particularly challenging in Argentina where there are dengue virus (DENV) outbreaks

36

frequently, history of jungle yellow fever, and Zika virus (ZIKV) activity was

37

demonstrated and YFV vaccination is common in some regions (7-10). The primary

38

antigen used in assays intended for IgM and IgG detection during flavivirus infections

39

has been the viral envelope (E) structural protein. However, the similarity of the

40

flavivirus E proteins causes problems with cross-reactivity and false-positive test

41

results, particularly in the acute and early convalescent phases. Plaque reduction

42

neutralization testing (PRNT) is the gold standard for serological diagnosis of

43

flavivirus, but this test is expensive, labor-intensive, and requires live virus

44

manipulation.

45

Regarding the specific antiviral response pattern against SLEV, IgM antibodies

46

persistence has been detected in some patients showing that the presence of IgM might

47

not be indicative of acute infection (11, 12). Spinsanti et al. have shown that in 57% of

48

the samples studied IgM antibodies persisted after a year of the infection. However, in

49

IgM positive samples the diagnosis should be confirmed by PRNT to differentiate

50

among Flavivirus. They have also demonstrated the persistence of the four subclasses of

51

IgG antibodies for more than a year and the presence of IgG early after infection(11).

52

SLEV is an icosahedral single-stranded RNA virus of approximately 11 kb that encodes

53

a single polyprotein that is processed co- and post-translationally to produce three

54

structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins involved in virus replication(13).

55

The non-structural protein NS5 is the viral methyl-transferase and RNA-dependent

56

RNA polymerase(13). NS5 is an essential protein for viral RNA synthesis with a mean

57

similarity among flaviviruses of 68%.

58

Due to the high cross-reactivity of the E protein among flavivirus it has been proposed

59

the use of non-structural proteins as antigens for diagnosis. It has been demonstrated

60

that IgM and IgG antibodies against non-structural proteins NS1, NS2B, NS3, and NS5

61

are produced during flavivirus infections (14-20). Besides, antibodies against the non-

62

structural proteins NS3 and NS5 have been detected in serum samples of patients

63

infected with WNV and DENV(15, 16, 18-20), and an NS5-based assay has been shown

64

to discriminate between WNV and DENV or SLEV infections(19). Recently, the use of

65

recombinant NS5 of DENV serotype 2 as antigen has allowed differentiating serum

66

samples of patients with primary and secondary DENV infections from serum samples

67

of patients with JEV and WNV infections taken during the acute and convalescent

68

phases(16, 18).

69

In this work, we developed an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using the purified

70

full-length recombinant SLEV NS5 as antigen for the detection of IgG antibodies in

71

human serum samples.

72

For antigen preparation, we cloned, expressed in E. coli and purified full-length NS5

73

from SLEV CbaAr-4005 strain. CbaAr-4005 is a genotype III strain of SLEV isolated

74

from Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in Córdoba, Argentina, in 2005, during the

75

largest SLEV outbreak ever reported in South America(21). After 2005 outbreak,

76

additional SLEV outbreaks in Argentina occurred in provinces of Entre Ríos (2006),

77

Buenos Aires (2010), and San Juan(2011) (5).

78

The NS5 expression and purification were carried out as previously described for

79

DENV NS5 (22). Briefly, the DNA fragment containing the coding region of full-length

80

NS5 was PCR amplified and cloned into the plasmid pET-28at BamHI and XhoI sites,

81

adding a six-histidine tag at the amino terminus of the proteins. The protein was

82

expressed in E. coli overnight at 20°C after induction with IPTG. The lysis of the cells

83

was carried out using a French press in phosphate binding buffer in the presence of

84

DNase I and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). After centrifugation, NS5 was purified

85

on a His-Trap nickel Sepharose affinity column (GE Healthcare) using the standard

86

procedure. The protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 300 mM

87

NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The dialyzed protein solution was further

88

purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column. Figure 1

89

shows an SDS-PAGE of samples collected through the protein purification protocol.

90

Approximately 3 mg of pure SLEV NS5 protein per liter of cell culture were obtained.

91

Anonymized barcode serum samples obtained from patients with febrile symptoms and

92

flavivirus infection confirmed or discharged at the National Reference Laboratory

93

(INEVH-ANLIS) were selected to evaluate the performance of the immunologic assay

94

described in this article. Plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was used as the

95

reference method for this evaluation. To perform this method, serum samples were heat

96

inactivated at 56˚C for 30 min; and two-fold serially diluted, from 1:20 to 1:2560.

97

Replicates of all dilutions of each serum sample were incubated, at 37 °C for 1 h, with

98

100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of WNV (ChimeriVax TM WNV strain), SLEV

99

(ChimeriVax TM SLEV strain), DENV-1 (Hawaii strain), DENV-2 (NGC strain),

DENV-3 (H87 strain), DENV-4 (H241 strain), WNV(ChimeriVax TM WNV strain),

101

YFV (vaccine 17D-YEL strain) and ZIKV(ARCB116141 strain). After incubation, 100

102

µl of each virus-serum mixture were inoculated onto a 12-well plate monolayer of Vero

103

C76 cells (80% confluent growth) and absorbed for 1 h at 37°C. First overlay medium

(containing low-melting point agarose (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies) Hank's BSS,

105

vitamins, amino acids, heat-inactivated calf serum, L-glutamine, and 7.5% sodium

106

bicarbonate) was added, 0.5 mL per well and allowed to solidify for 15 minutes. The

107

plates where SLEV and WNV were tested were incubated for four days; and plates

108

where DENV 1-4, YFV and ZIKV were assayed were incubated for 5 days. Neutral red

109

staining was performed by adding a neutral red second overlay (same as above without

110

fetal calf serum and containing 4% Neutral Red [Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO]), 0.5

111

mL per well and allowed to solidify for 15 minutes. Plates were incubated overnight at

112

37°C with 4% CO2 and plaques were counted and titers were calculated and expressed

113

as the reciprocal of the serum dilution yielding a ≥90% reduction in PFU (PRNT90).

114

The results of the PRNT are shown in table 1. Fifty-nine sera were analyzed, 19 were

115

positive for SLEV, 14 DENV positive (85.7% DENV- 1, 7.1 % DENV-2, 7.1 % without

116

serotype), 9 YFV positive, 4 ZIKV positive, and 14 were negative for the analyzed

117

viruses. Monotypic or heterotypic patterns were differentiated according to whether the

118

serum was positive to one or several flaviviruses, respectively. In heterotypic patterns,

119

interpretation of PRNT data was as follows: samples with a neutralizing antibody titer

120

(PRNT90) ≥ four-fold higher than the other flavivirus titers were considered positive for

121

antibody to that virus. Using these samples representative of the flavivirus that co-

122

circulate in our country we evaluated our enzyme immunoassay. We developed a

123

standard indirect immunoassay to detect SLEV NS5-specific IgG in human sera. For

124

this purpose, we determined an optimum NS5 concentration of 500 ng/well and a

125

dilution 1:100 of serum samples. The antigen was coated overnight at 4°C in a 96-

126

microwell plate in a solution containing 50 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6. After coating, the

127

plates were washed three times with PBS and blocked with casein 0.2% in PBS

128

(blocking solution) at 37°C for 1 h. Later, sera from patients were diluted 1:100 in

129

blocking solution and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Then, the plates were PBS washed and

130

incubated with HRP conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Abcam) 1:2000 at 37°C for

131

2h. After washing the plates, ABTS (KPL labs) peroxidase substrate was added and

132

after 15 min the reaction was stopped with SDS and the optical density at 405 nm was

133

determined.

134

Based on PRNT90 results we separated the samples into three groups: SLEV positive,

135

other positive flavivirus and negative samples. The results clearly show that the assay

136

efficiently discriminates SLEV positives samples from positive samples for other

137

flavivirus or negative samples (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows the results for each individual

138

serum sample. The cut-off to considerate a sample as positive by EIA was determined

139

as 0.3, calculated as the mean value of negative samples plus two standard deviations.

140

Taking into account this value, 16 out of 19 samples considered positive by PRNT were

141

also positive by EIA (84%). Interestingly, the sera of SLEV infected patients (both

142

homotypic and heterotypic pattern) can react with the recombinant NS5 protein, and no

143

positive sample for DENV, YFV, ZIKV or WNV resulted positive in our assay. This is

144

important since the presence of antibodies against NS5 in sera from patients infected

145

with SLEV had never been reported. Using NS5 as an antigen for IgG detection we

146

were able to avoid cross-reaction with antibodies to other flaviviruses. Although the

147

number of serum positive samples for other flaviviruses was limited the results suggest

148

that this test could be useful as a diagnostic method for SLEV infections. Further studies

149

with a larger panel of serum samples will be necessary to validate this method. The

150

three negative samples (9, 10, and 44) had low antibodies titers as judged by PRNT90,

151

which could explain the negative result observed in our EIA. Although PRNT is the

152

gold standard method we cannot rule out that the results observed for these samples are

153

not due to cross reactivity against some other flavivirus not tested here (e.g., Ilheus

154

virus, Bussuquara virus). The specificity of NS5-based EIA might reduce or eliminate

155

the need for PRNT and therefore the requirement of BSL3 to the diagnosis of SLEV.

156

Also, EIA is a 1 to 2-day assay compared with PRNT that is a 5 to 7-day assay.

157

In Argentina different flaviviruses that can produce similar clinical symptoms co-

158

circulate. The laboratory diagnosis is crucial to determine the etiological agent causing

159

the disease. Molecular methods (RT-PCR) are useful during the acute-phase, and then

160

serological methods should be used. In our assay, we were able to detect IgG antibodies

161

against NS5 in samples collected from five to 175 days after the onset of the symptoms

162

(Table 1 and figure 3), this includes the acute and the convalescent phase.

163

The complexity of flavivirus diagnosis requires developing novel diagnostic methods,

164

that, combined with those existing, allow us properly identifying these viruses.

165

In conclusion, we show that the EIA test based on NS5 is a potential diagnostic method

166

for SLEV that avoids cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses and implies a less

167

laborious and expensive method, safer and feasible to introduce in laboratories of low

168

complexity.
