Abstract
Purpose: To identify physical activity barriers and facilitators experienced by people with systemic
sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma).
Materials and Methods: We conducted nominal group technique sessions with SSc patients who shared
barriers to physical activities, barrier-specific facilitators, and general facilitators. Participants rated
importance of barriers and likelihood of using facilitators from 0-10, and indicated whether they had tried
facilitators. Barriers and facilitators across sessions were subsequently merged to eliminate overlap;
edited based on feedback from investigators, patient advisors, and clinicians; and categorized.
Results: We conducted nine sessions (n=41 total participants) and initially generated 181 barriers, 457
barrier-specific facilitators, and 20 general facilitators. The number of consolidated barriers (barrierspecific facilitators in parentheses) for each category were: 14 (61) for health and medical; 4 (23) for
social and personal; 1 (3) for time, work, and lifestyle; and 1 (4) for environmental. There were 12
consolidated general facilitators. The consolidated items with ≥ 1/3 of participants’ ratings ≥ 8 were: 15
barriers, 69 barrier-specific facilitators, and 9 general facilitators.
Conclusions: People with SSc reported many barriers related to health and medical aspects of SSc and
several barriers in other categories. They reported facilitators to remain physically active despite the
barriers.

Implications for Rehabilitation:
•

People with scleroderma experience difficulty being physically active due to the diverse
and often severe manifestations of the disease, including involvement of the skin,
musculoskeletal system, and internal organs.

•

In addition to regular care of scleroderma-related symptoms, patients overcome many
exercise challenges by selecting physical activities that are comfortable for them,
adjusting the intensity and duration of activities, adapting activities, and using adapted
equipment or other materials to reduce discomfort.

•

Rehabilitation professionals should help people with scleroderma to tailor activity options
to their capacity and needs when providing care and advice to promote physical activity.

Introduction
Regular physical activity is recommended to enhance health among people in the general
population [1,2] and for those with chronic diseases [3]. For people with autoimmune rheumatic
diseases, health benefits of physical activity training programs may include reduced
inflammation, better clinical outcomes, and improved health-related quality of life [4].
Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare chronic, autoimmune rheumatic disease
characterized by abnormal fibrotic processes and excessive collagen production that can affect
the skin, musculoskeletal system, and internal organs, including the heart, lungs, and
gastrointestinal tract [5,6]. People with SSc are classified as having limited (skin involvement of
face, neck, and areas distal to the knees and elbows) or diffuse cutaneous SSc (skin involvement
proximal and distal to the knees and elbows or trunk). Patients with the diffuse subtype typically
have earlier onset of internal organ involvement and more rapidly progressive disease [7].
Most people with SSc can perform aerobic and resistance exercise safely, and regular
physical activity is often encouraged [8]. Many, however, face barriers to being physically active
[9]. Barriers to being active likely differ across people with SSc, but common barriers may
include limitations in physical mobility, respiratory problems, gastrointestinal problems, fatigue,
pain, and depression and anxiety [10-12].
Interventions to promote physical activity have been shown to increase activity levels in
both the general population [13] and among people with chronic diseases [14]. No physical
activity interventions have been developed and tested for people with SSc, and no studies have
assessed SSc-specific barriers and facilitators to physical activity. The objective of the present
study was to identify barriers and facilitators to physical activity as experienced by people with
SSc in order to help rehabilitation therapists provide appropriate care and to generate survey

items to be used in a survey that will guide the development of a physical activity promotion
program for people with SSc.
Materials and Methods
Participants and Procedures
We conducted a series of 90-120 minute face-to-face nominal group technique (NGT)
sessions at provincial and national SSc patient conferences in Canada and the United States, and
at an international SSc patient conference in France. The NGT was originally designed to
structure group discussions so that participants can share and compare experiences and reach
consensus [15,16]. More recently, it has been used as a method for directly generating items for
needs assessment surveys, including in SSc [17].
For each NGT session, we attempted to recruit up to 8 participants. Eligible participants
had received a diagnosis of SSc, were ≥18 years of age, and were fluent in English or French,
depending on the conference setting. Prior to each patient conference, we recruited participants
through online announcements to participants in the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention
Network (SPIN) Cohort, a large international SSc cohort; emails and website posts from SSc
patient organization partners; and social media (Twitter and Facebook). People with SSc who
expressed interest in the study were contacted via email by the study coordinator to confirm
eligibility and to provide them with details about the study. At each conference, we also recruited
via a table and direct investigator-patient contact. All participants provided written consent and
were given the opportunity to ask questions about the study. This study was approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
Prior to beginning each NGT session, participants completed a brief questionnaire to obtain
information on sex, age, race/ethnicity, relationship status, educational attainment, occupational

status, SSc diagnosis subtype, and years since SSc diagnosis. Participants were also asked to
select the physical activities that they perform from a list (walking, jogging, aerobics, swimming,
cycling, yoga or similar exercises) and to add activities if they were not listed. For each activity,
they indicated the usual amount of time spent (number of months per year and hours per week).
Nominal Group Technique Protocol
We adapted a NGT topic guide from a previously successful NGT study (see Supplemental
Material 1) [17]. Before the first NGT session, investigators pilot tested the adapted NGT topic
guide. NGT sessions were held in private hotel conference rooms and were moderated by two
study investigators who were knowledgeable about SSc and had previous experience with
discussion-based research. The moderators for each session always included a doctoral student in
clinical psychology (DBR) and either a research assistant (JC), a master’s student in psychiatry
(SH), or a clinical psychologist (BDT). The final number of NGT sessions was determined based
on the redundancy and consistency of data obtained.
Participants were informed that the objectives of the NGT session were to: (1) develop a
list of key barriers to physical activity that they have experienced related to SSc, and (2) develop
a list of possible facilitators to overcome the barriers to promote and support physical activity
among people with SSc. Participants were first presented with the question: “Think about those
barriers or challenges that you have experienced related to SSc. What barriers have you
experienced when thinking about or actually being physically active?” They were asked to
individually write on a piece of paper, without consultation with other group members, their
personal list of examples of barriers to physical activity. Then, they were invited to share one
barrier at a time from their lists in a round-robin format until all barriers from each participant’s
list had been shared. They were instructed not to repeat barriers that were verbatim to barriers

provided by others but to share any barriers that seemed to differ, even if only minimally. If
clarification was necessary, moderators used probes to gain a clearer understanding of the
barriers shared (e.g., “can you elaborate on that?”). As they were shared, barriers were
simultaneously typed on a computer by one moderator and projected onto a screen to be viewed
by the moderators and participants. Once all barriers had been shared, moderators led an
interactive discussion of the barriers among participants to reword unclear barriers, add any new
barriers, remove or merge overlapping barriers, or separate individual barriers with multiple
components into more than one barrier. Barriers were revised based on group feedback until
agreement was reached for decisions on all barriers.
Next, participants were presented with the second research question: “Think about possible
facilitators or strategies to overcome these barriers to promote and support physical activity
among people with SSc. What barrier-specific facilitators would be helpful to overcome each
barrier, and what general facilitators would be helpful to overcome multiple barriers and address
physical activity in general?” For instance, the barrier-specific facilitator example of “electric
heated gloves” could address the barrier of “Raynaud’s phenomenon (cold, wind, and
humidity)”, whereas the general facilitator example of “exercising with other people” could
apply to multiple barriers and physical activity in general. Participants were asked to write any
examples of possible barrier-specific and general facilitators, and the same sharing and
discussion process used for answering the first research question was then applied to this
research question.
Once a final list of unique barrier and facilitator examples was agreed upon, one moderator
printed a copy of the list for each participant. In all sessions, participants were asked to
independently rate the importance of each barrier on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 representing

barriers that were not personally important to them when thinking about or being physically
active, and 10 representing barriers that were extremely important to them when thinking about
or being physically active. They rated the likelihood that they would use each barrier-specific
facilitator to overcome the barrier to be physically active on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0
representing facilitators that they would not likely use at all, and 10 representing facilitators that
they would very likely use. Using the same scale, they also rated the likelihood that they would
use each general facilitator. In all but the first two sessions, participants indicated whether they
had or had not tried each facilitator.
Data Processing, Revision, and Analysis
Sociodemographic characteristics and physical activity levels of participants were
presented descriptively. All barrier and facilitator examples generated across NGT sessions were
compiled into a single list of examples. Many barriers and facilitators identified from individual
NGT sessions were similar to those identified in other sessions. Therefore, similar barriers and
facilitators were merged into single items, and a merged initial list of items was generated by
consensus among investigators. For instance, the barrier item of “difficulty grasping objects”
could capture multiple participant examples (e.g., “difficulty gripping weights or bars” and
“difficulty grasping things with my hands”).
The initial list of items received three stages of revision by (1) study investigators, (2) 9
members of the SPIN Patient Advisory Team, and (3) 23 health care providers affiliated with
SPIN (12 rheumatology physicians, 5 internal medicine physicians, 2 psychologists, 2
physiotherapists, 1 physical and rehabilitation medicine physician, and 1 vascular physician).
First, investigators reworded unclear items and excluded items that were too vague (e.g., get a
cleaner) or not directly related to physical activity (e.g., surgery), which could not inform the

development of a physical activity intervention in SSc. Following this, patient advisors and then
health care providers made recommendations to reword items, exclude items, and add new items.
Patient advisors and health care providers evaluated whether barrier items met two criteria: (1)
they would affect some people with SSc meaningfully (versus only trivially) and (2) they would
plausibly be a reason why people with SSc do not participate in physical activity, and whether
facilitator items met three criteria: (1) they would be feasibly and realistically used by some
people with SSc, (2) they would plausibly address the corresponding barrier (general facilitators
would plausibly address multiple barriers and physical activity in general) to support physical
activity, and (3) they could be accessed or safely applied by many people with SSc. Study
investigators used an iterative process at each stage to implement suggested revisions until
consensus on a final list of items was attained.
To group together barriers that share a common basis, we performed a qualitative content
analysis [18] of barriers using four categories described by Lascar et al. [19]: (1) health and
medical; (2) social and personal; (3) time, work, and lifestyle; and (4) environmental. Study
investigators reviewed and attained consensus on classification of barrier items. All processing
and analyses were conducted with Microsoft Excel version 16.16.
Results
Between September 2017 and September 2018, nine NGT sessions were held at the 2017
Scleroderma Society of Nova Scotia Patient Education Forum (one session; Halifax, Canada);
2017 Scleroderma Foundation Tri-State Chapter Fall Research Forum (one session; New York,
USA); 2018 Systemic Sclerosis World Congress (two sessions; Bordeaux, France); 2018
Scleroderma Foundation National Patient Education Conference (four sessions; Philadelphia,
USA); and 2018 Scleroderma Canada National Conference (one session; Calgary, Canada). The

number of participants per session ranged from 3 to 8. Eight sessions were in English and one in
French (Bordeaux, France).
Participant Characteristics and Engagement in Physical Activity
A total of 41 people with SSc (34 female, 7 male) participated in the nine NGT sessions
(table 1). Participants ranged in age from 27 to 76 years (mean = 56.2 years; standard deviation =
12.2). Most participants were retired (34.1%), employed full-time (22.0%), or on disability
(19.5%). The majority were diagnosed with diffuse SSc (58.5%).

[Insert table 1 here]

All but one participant reported performing at least one type of physical activity (table 2).
Most participants engaged in gentle aerobic exercises such as walking, yoga, and swimming.
Participants also reported that they performed other physical activities not stated in the
questionnaire (n=22) such as tennis, skiing, and gardening.

[Insert table 2 here]

Barriers and Facilitators to Physical Activity
The nine NGT sessions generated an initial list of 181 examples of physical activity
barriers, 457 examples of barrier-specific facilitators, and 20 examples of general facilitators
experienced by participants, including similar examples shared in different sessions (see
Supplemental Material 2). Figure 1 illustrates the steps used to derive the final survey items from
participant examples. Similar examples were merged to attain an initial list of items comprised of

48 barriers, 299 barrier-specific facilitators, and 14 general facilitators. There were 109
facilitator items that participants described as barrier-specific which were deemed as general,
merged with existing general facilitator items, and used to inform the description of the 14 initial
general facilitators. There were 28 excluded barrier items (most were not directly related to
physical activity), 116 excluded barrier-specific facilitator items (most were vague, potentially
harmful, or not generally accessible), and 4 excluded general facilitator items (vague or not
generally accessible). Additionally, 17 new barrier-specific facilitator items and 2 new general
facilitator items were recommended and added. Therefore, the final list of items (see
Supplemental Material 3) consisted of 20 barriers, 91 barrier-specific facilitators, and 12 general
facilitators. The number of barrier-specific facilitator items per barrier item ranged from 2 to 10.

[Insert figure 1 here]

Of 20 total barriers in the final list of items, 14 (70%) were health and medical barriers
which addressed symptoms (e.g., fatigue) as well as medical conditions (e.g., Raynaud’s
phenomenon) and activity restrictions (e.g., activities involving water may worsen condition of
hands or skin on other areas of the body). Of 61 health and medical barrier-specific facilitators,
most involved strategies to beginning and selecting physical activities (e.g., exercise at a time of
day when you have the most energy – fatigue barrier), adapting the conduct of activities (e.g., for
acid reflux, modify exercise positions to keep your body upright – gastrointestinal problems
barrier), adjusting the intensity and duration of activities (e.g., lower the intensity of the exercise
to not experience shortness of breath – shortness of breath barrier), using adapted equipment or
other materials to reduce discomfort (e.g., insert warmers in gloves or mittens or socks –

Raynaud’s phenomenon barrier), and health behaviours to reduce the impact of barriers (e.g., do
gentle stretching and movement to warm up the joints before exercise – joint stiffness and
contractures barrier).
There were 4 social and personal barriers (20% of total barriers) that addressed feelings
about physical activity (e.g., fear of injury or extended recovery time) and being in social settings
(e.g., feeling embarrassed or discouraged due to physical ability, appearance, or judgement from
others). Of 23 social and personal barrier-specific facilitators, most were methods to feel
comfortable with physical activity (e.g., have an introductory session with a qualified exercise
trainer to discuss your fears and get an assessment – fear of injury or extended recovery time
barrier) and to increase physical activity (e.g., keep an exercise log to track your progress – lack
of motivation and difficulty committing to exercise barrier).
There was 1 time, work, and lifestyle barrier related to one’s life circumstances (finding
time available to schedule exercise). There were 3 related facilitators, which included exercising
at home or work to eliminate travel time, and breaking the exercise into several short periods
(also listed as a facilitator to address the fatigue barrier) if one long period was not feasible
because of family, work and so on. Lastly, there was 1 environmental barrier related to
preventing access to physical activity opportunities (costs related to exercise) with 4 facilitators
about free exercise resources and opportunities (e.g., sign up for free activities or exercise classes
organized by your community).
Figure 2 shows the distribution of ratings of importance of barrier items from the NGT
sessions. The number of ratings per item depended on the number of sessions that identified
examples related to the item, the number of examples of experiences related to the item in those
sessions (some sessions elicited multiple examples captured by one item), and the number of

participants in the sessions where those examples were elicited. The 3 most-rated barriers were
health and medical barriers: (1) fatigue, (2) joint stiffness and contractures, and (3) shortness of
breath. The 3 most-rated barrier-specific facilitators were also in the health and medical
category: (1) wear heated or non-heated warm gloves or mittens and socks (Raynaud’s
phenomenon barrier), (2) get enough sleep and plan to take a nap during the day (fatigue barrier),
and (3) do strength training exercises (muscle weakness and difficulty with mobility barrier). The
3 most-rated general facilitators related to adapting physical activity were: (1) consult with your
health care provider or exercise professional to discuss any concerns and/or custom design an
exercise program that is matched to your capacity and needs, (2) exercise at a pace or intensity
that is comfortable for you - start easy, progress slowly - if you have pain, adapt the exercise or
seek advice, and (3) adapt the exercise or try a new exercise. There were 15 barrier items, 69
barrier-specific facilitator items, and 9 general facilitator items for which at least 1/3 of ratings
were ³ 8 for importance (barriers) or likelihood of using them (facilitators). In addition, there
was 1 barrier item, 60 barrier-specific facilitator items, and 9 general facilitator items for which
at least 50% of ratings were ³ 8.

Discussion
Using the NGT method, we identified a list of survey items comprised of 20 barriers, 91
barrier-specific facilitators, and 12 general facilitators to physical activity as experienced by
people with SSc. Most barriers fell into the health and medical category, but there were also
others grouped into three categories: social and personal; time, work, and lifestyle; and

other patient groups or the general population, as well as SSc-specific barriers and facilitators not
previously identified in the literature.
Participants’ sociodemographic characteristics were mostly similar to the larger SSc
population [20,21]. Specifically, 82.9% were female (versus 87.8% of the SPIN Cohort), mean
age was 56.2 (versus 55.5), 85.4% were white (versus 83.6%), 70.7% were married (versus
67.7%), mean years of highest level of educational attainment was 15.7 (versus 15.4) and mean
years since diagnosis was 10.8 (versus 9.7). They differed on full- or part-time employment
(29.3% of participants versus 40.6% of cohort) and diffuse SSc subtype (58.5% of participants
versus 41.3% of cohort).
Barriers in the health and medical category were generally related to SSc disease
manifestation or pathology; 12 of 14 health and medical barriers reflect symptoms common in
SSc [10]. This study was the first to elicit barriers and facilitators to physical activity directly
from people with SSc, but the health and medical barriers identified are consistent with results
from other studies that have found that decreased physical activity is associated with fatigue,
pain, muscle weakness, and disability in SSc [9,22]. They are also similar to barriers to physical
activity reported by people with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including fatigue, pain,
stiffness, joint symptoms, and reduced mobility or functional ability [23-26].
Barriers in the social and personal; time, work, and lifestyle; and environmental categories
were similar to perceived barriers reported by people in the general population and people with
other autoimmune rheumatic diseases. These included fear of injury, cost of exercise, lack of
motivation, and lack of time [23-29]. One social and personal barrier, feeling embarrassed or

discouraged due to physical ability, appearance, or judgement from others, may more closely
reflect the experience of people with SSc, including visible changes to their appearance [30].
General facilitators, such as individually adapted physical activity, exercise partners, group
exercise, and support from exercise instructors and health care providers, were similar to those
identified by people with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases [23-26]. Previous studies have
not elicited facilitators to address SSc-specific problems; therefore barrier-specific facilitators
identified in the present study will be useful to address these barriers.
Information on barriers and facilitators has been used to develop physical activity
interventions for the general population [31] and for people with other diseases (e.g., rheumatoid
arthritis [32]). The present study was the first phase of the SPIN-Physical ACtivity Enhancement
(SPIN-PACE) Project, the aim of which is to develop, test, and disseminate free-of-charge an
online SSc-specific intervention to promote and support physical activity. Based on the results of
the present study, a survey will be administered via the SPIN Cohort, an international cohort of
over 1,800 people with scleroderma. This will provide information on how common the barriers
identified in the present study are and their importance in hindering or impeding engagement in
physical activity, as well as the likelihood of using the proposed barrier-specific and general
facilitators that were identified. The survey results will inform the development of the planned
intervention so that it addresses barriers experienced by people with SSc.
Limitations
Interpretation of results should consider study limitations. First, we recruited study
participants from among people attending patient conferences, and they may not be
representative of all people with SSc. In comparison to the SPIN Cohort, a smaller proportion of
participants in our study were full- or part-time employed, and a larger proportion of participants

had the diffuse SSc subtype. Second, all but one participant reported performing at least one type
of physical activity. It is possible that we did not identify important barriers or facilitators for
people with SSc who do not engage in physical activity at all. However, the 17 barrier-specific
facilitators and 2 general facilitators added by patient advisors and health care providers
affiliated with SPIN likely minimized this limitation. Third, although 41 people with SSc
participated in the present study and many barriers and facilitators were similar across NGT
sessions, it is possible that some potentially important barriers and facilitators were not
identified. Therefore, in our planned survey using the SPIN Cohort, we will also ask respondents
to suggest new barriers and facilitators.
Conclusion
In summary, people with SSc reported many barriers related to health and medical aspects
of SSc, as well as social and personal; time, work, and lifestyle; and environmental barriers.
They further reported facilitators that have helped them remain physically active despite the
barriers. The list of barriers and facilitators will be used to survey a much larger number of
people with SSc via the SPIN Cohort, which will inform the development of an online physical
activity intervention for people with SSc.

were only rated by participants in sessions where the examples were elicited. The number of
ratings can exceed the total of 41 participants because examples were rated before we merged
them together into single items. If 3 examples subsequently merged into a single item were each
rated by 6 people, then the merged item would have 18 ratings.
