Abstract

39

Purpose: Refractive error is caused by a disparity between the axial length and focusing power

40

of the eye. Nanophthalmos is a rare ocular abnormality in which both eyes are abnormally

41

small, typically causing extreme hyperopic refractive error, and associated with an increased

42

risk of angle-closure glaucoma.

43

Methods: A cohort of 40 individuals from 13 unrelated nanophthalmos kindreds were recruited,

44

with 11 probands subjected to exome sequencing.

45

Results: Nine probands (69.2%) were assigned a genetic diagnosis, with variants in PRSS56

46

(4), MFRP (3), and previously reported variants in TMEM98 (1) and MYRF (1). Two of the four

47

PRSS56 probands harboured the previously described c.1066dupC frameshift variant

48

implicated in over half of all reported PRSS56 kindreds, with surrounding haplotypes distinct

49

from each other, and from a previously reported Tunisian c.1066dupC haplotype. Individuals

50

with a genetic diagnosis had shorter mean axial lengths (P=7.22x10-9) and more extreme

51

hyperopia (P=0.0005) than those without a genetic diagnosis, with recessive forms associated

52

with the shortest axial lengths and highest hyperopia. All individuals with an axial length below

53

18 mm in their smaller eye (17/17) were assigned a genetic diagnosis.

54

Conclusions: These findings detail the genetic architecture of nanophthalmos in an Australian

55

cohort of predominantly European ancestry, their relative clinical phenotypes, and highlight the

56

shared genetic architecture of rare and common disorders of refractive error.

Introduction

60

Clear vision requires precise regulation of ocular growth, such that the axial length of the eye

61

matches the optical focal plane created by the cornea and lens. A discrepancy between the two

62

results in refractive error, which is the leading cause of visual impairment and the second

63

leading cause of blindness worldwide.1 Refractive error may be termed either myopia (where the

64

focal point is in front of the retina) or hyperopia (where it falls behind it). Both forms of refractive

65

error are correctable, although individuals at the extremes of refractive error are at an increased

66

risk of irreversible blindness due to associated complications such as myopic macular

67

degeneration, retinal detachment, or primary open-angle glaucoma (in the case of myopia); or

68

strabismus, amblyopia, retinal detachment and angle-closure glaucoma (in the case of

69

hyperopia).2

70
71

Important insight into the developmental regulation of ocular axial length has come from the

72

study of microphthalmia, which affects approximately 1 in 10,000 live births.3 Nanophthalmos

73

and posterior microphthalmos are two rare subtypes of microphthalmia, both of which are

74

associated with reduced axial length and high hyperopia.4 Posterior microphthalmos is

75

characterised by reduced length of the posterior segment of the eye, with the anterior segment

76

typically of normal length. Patients with posterior microphthalmos usually present with reduced

77

visual acuity from an increase in the papillomacular retinal fold, occasional pigmentary

78

retinopathy, and are susceptible to uveal effusions.5,6 Unlike posterior microphthalmos,

79

nanophthalmos is characterized by a decrease in the size of both posterior and anterior

80

segments, with a predisposition to primary angle-closure glaucoma.5,6 However, both posterior

81

microphthalmos and nanophthalmos can be allelic7, supporting the hypothesis that they

82

represent a continuum of the same phenotypic spectrum, rather than two distinct entities.8

84

Posterior microphthalmos and nanophthalmos are commonly inherited as autosomal recessive

85

traits, with variants in two genes accounting for the majority of known cases. The first of these,

86

MFRP (membrane frizzled-related protein), is expressed in retinal pigment epithelium and ciliary

87

body, where a lack of MFRP disrupts emmetropization through an uncertain mechanism.9,10

88

Rare biallelic MFRP variants have been associated with nanophthalmos11, isolated posterior

89

microphthalmos7, and posterior microphthalmos with retinitis pigmentosa, foveoschisis, and

90

optic disc drusen12. Both MFRP-deficient mice13 and zebrafish14 have hyperopic phenotypes,

91

consistent with a presumed loss-of-function mechanism in humans11. Viral transduction of wild-

92

type Mfrp into 5 day-old Mfrp mutant mice can also restore axial length13, suggesting that MFRP

93

provides support for ocular development both in utero and after birth.

94
95

A second gene, PRSS56 (protease, serine, 56), was initially identified in autosomal recessive

96

nanophthalmos and posterior microphthalmos kindreds from the Faroe Islands, Tunisia,

97

Canada, and Mexico.15–17 A chemically-induced mouse mutant at the orthologous locus showed

98

close phenotypic parallels, with shortened axial length, hyperopia, and a propensity for angle

99

closure.17 Recent work has shown that PRSS56 is derived from late retinal progenitor cells or

100

Müller glia, and promotes elongation of ocular axial length both before and after eye opening.18

101

PRSS56 variants have also been implicated in multiple independent genome-wide association

102

studies of myopia.19–21

103
104

Autosomal dominant nanophthalmos is a less common clinical entity, and until recently only

105

associated with variants in TMEM9822,23. Like PRSS56, TMEM98 has also been associated with

106

myopia in a large genome-wide association study.21 A second dominant nanophthalmos locus,

107

previously mapped to chromosome 1124, has now been associated with variants in MYRF,

108

which encodes a transcriptional regulator that drives expression of TMEM98.25–28

Methods

116
117

Subjects

118

Individuals with nanophthalmos were recruited through the Australian and New Zealand

119

Registry of Advanced Glaucoma29, and were included if they presented with bilateral and

120

symmetrically small eyes, with an axial length less than 20 mm in both eyes. This threshold of

121

20 mm was previously shown to account for individuals below 3 standard deviations from the

122

mean in the EPIC-Norfolk Eye Study, and proposed as a definition for nanophthalmos in the

123

absence of any other standardised definition.30 Exclusion criteria included unilateral disease,

124

anterior segment coloboma, and multiple non-ophthalmic syndromic features. Angle closure

125

glaucoma status was assessed in all participants, yet was not a criterion for inclusion. Ocular

126

hypertension was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) above 21 mmHg, with glaucoma

127

defined as a glaucomatous visual field defect with a corresponding neuroretinal rim thinning.

128

Previously reported families with variants in TMEM98 and MYRF were included in this

129

cohort.23,28 Research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki with informed consent

130

obtained from the subjects after explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the

131

study. Ethics approval was granted by the Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics

132

Committee.

135

Exome sequencing and analysis was performed as previously described.31 Briefly, genomic

136

DNA was extracted from venous blood samples using a QiaAmp DNA blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen),

137

or from saliva using Oragene saliva DNA collection kits (DNA Genotek) according to the

138

manufacturers' protocols. Exome capture was performed using the Agilent SureSelect system

139

(v4 or v5) and paired-end libraries sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq (2000, 2500, or 4000). Read

140

alignment and variant calling were performed according to GATK best practices for germline

141

short variant discovery (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/). Variant annotation was

142

performed using Variant Effect Predictor, with population frequencies from gnomAD and

143

Bravo/TOPMed freeze 5 collections.32 All putative causal variants were manually inspected in

144

IGV. Capillary sequencing for MFRP or PRSS56 was performed using primer sequences

145

available upon request. RNAseq data was generated on tissues from 21 healthy donor eyes

146

from 21 individuals as previously described.33

147
148

Statistical analysis

149

Data were analysed with R (v3.6.1), with continuous variables displayed as mean ± SD (for

150

normally distributed variables) or IQR (for non-normal variables), and categorical variables

151

displayed as numbers and percentages. Mean values for axial length and spherical equivalent

152

were calculated per individual using data from both eyes. P values were calculated by one-way

153

ANOVA with Tukey multiple pairwise-comparison testing for normally distributed continuous

154

variables, by Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normal continuous variables, or by Fisher’s exact test

155

for categorical variables. One-way between-group analysis of covariance was used to compare

156

differences between groups adjusted by age.

160

We recruited a total of 40 individuals with nanophthalmos from 13 families. The mean age at

161

recruitment was 47.5 ± 20.7 years, 57.5% were female, and 69.2% of families were of self-

162

reported European ancestry (European (9), mixed European/Indigenous Australian (1),

163

Lebanese (1), Vietnamese (1), not reported (1)) (Figure 1A). Exome sequencing was performed

164

on one or more affected individuals from each family, with the exception of family NNO03, in

165

which a causative variant was identified by capillary sequencing. When including two previously

166

reported pedigrees23,28, a suspected genetic cause was identified in 9 of 13 kindreds (69.2%), in

167

genes including PRSS56 (4), MFRP (3), TMEM98 (1), and MYRF (1) (Figure 1B, C, D, E). All

168

variants were rare or absent in gnomAD, with CADD scores above 24, and recessive variants

169

confirmed to be in trans by parental segregation testing (Table 1). Within tissues of dissected

170

cadaveric human eyes33, expression of the dominant genes MYRF and TMEM98 was more

171

similar to one another that to the recessive genes MFRP and PRSS56 (Figure 1F).

194

We identified four predicted pathogenic variants in MFRP across three probands, including one

195

nonsense variant previously associated with nanophthalmos (p.(Gln175Ter))11, one splice site

196

variant previously associated with retinitis pigmentosa (c.1124+1G>T)34, and two missense

197

variants with no previous disease associations (p.(Ala570Val) and p.(Gly503Val)) (Figure 1D,E).

198
199

Of the four probands with variants in PRSS56, all were found to have rare compound

200

heterozygous or homozygous variants (Figure 1D,E, Table 1). These variants include previously

201

unreported essential splice (c.849+1G>T and c.97+2dupT), frameshift (p.(Ala115GlyfsTer39)),

202

and missense variants (p.(Arg564Cys)) predicted to be pathogenic, as well as two instances of

203

the previously reported c.1066dupC frameshift variant. The PRSS56 c.1066dupC frameshift

204

insertion (also reported as c.1059_1066insC, or p.(Gln356ProfsTer152)), had previously been

205

reported in multiple Tunisian families with posterior microphthalmos (Figure 2A).15,17,35 A more

206

recent study revealed that a c.1066dupC variant found in multiple Tunisian families was derived

207

from a common ancestor around 1,850 years earlier.35 Another nine cases explained by the

208

c.1066dupC variant have also been reported in a Saudi Arabian cohort of microphthalmia and

209

posterior microphthalmos, accounting for 69% (9/13) of all cases with PRSS56 variants in this

210

report8, as well as in Egyptian and Lebanese patients.36 It is not clear whether this was also due

211

to a founder effect, although cohort ancestry (Saudi Arabian, Egyptian, and Lebanese) suggests

212

that these cases were unlikely to share the Tunisian founder haplotype.

To determine the origin of the c.1066dupC frameshift variant in our two Australian kindreds, we

224

compared surrounding haplotypes in NNO18, NNO02, and the previously described Tunisian

225

founder haplotype (Figure 2B).35 Three phased variants were genotyped in both the NNO18

226

proband and the Tunisian founder (rs733602, rs2245601, and rs2767), yet the genotypes in

227

each were divergent, suggesting that the two alleles had arisen independently. Similarly, the

228

NNO02 haplotype included the C allele of rs2767 (compared to T in the Tunisian founder),

229

suggesting that the c.1066dupC variant in NNO02 was also unlikely to have come from the

230

Tunisian founder. To compare the origins of the PRSS56 haplotypes in NNO02 and NNO18, we

231

made use of a closely linked variant (rs79792358) in PRSS56 (149 bp downstream of

232

c.1066dupC). This variant and the c.1066dupC insertion were both present in the NNO02

233

proband but absent from the NNO18 proband, suggesting that the NNO02 and NNO18

234

frameshift variants arose independently on different haplotypes (Figure 2B).

the gnomAD collection of genomes and exomes (Figure 2C), representing over half (58/112) of

251

all reported PRSS56 loss-of-function variants. These 58 c.1066dupC variants were distributed

252

across seven ancestral populations at allele frequencies between 2.5 x 10-4 and 6.9 x 10-4,

253

consistent with the independent emergence of c.1066dupC variants in multiple populations

254

(Figure 2D). PRSS56 c.1066 was also noted to be a multiallelic site, with insertions and

255

deletions reported at the same position (Figure 2C), both of which altered the length of an eight

256

nucleotide cytosine mononucleotide repeat (Figure 2E).

Figure 3: Genetic diagnosis is associated with shorter axial lengths and increased hyperopia.
Ocular axial length (A) and spherical equivalent (B) of affected family members stratified by genetic
diagnosis. Mean values were calculated per individual using data from both eyes. For both comparisons,
group means were significantly different by one-way ANOVA (P<0.0003), with asterisks (*) indicating a
significant difference from the unsolved cohort (Tukey multiple comparison testing, P<0.003).

265

Individuals with suspected pathogenic variants in PRSS56, MFRP, TMEM98, or MYRF had

266

reduced ocular axial length (Figure 3A, Table 2), with the majority also highly hyperopic (Figure

267

3B, Table 2). The mean axial length was significantly shorter in groups with a genetic diagnosis

268

compared to those without (P=7.22x10-9), with the PRSS56 subset also having a shorter mean

269

axial length than the dominant TMEM98 (adjusted P=0.00003) and MYRF (adjusted P=0.00004)

270

subsets (Figure 3A). All groups also had a significantly higher mean refractive error (P=0.0005),

271

with PRSS56 and MFRP groups more hyperopic than nanophthalmic individuals without a

272

genetic diagnosis (Figure 3B, Table 2). Across the entire cohort and in those where data were

273

available, 22.6% (7/31) had glaucoma, and 43.3% (13/30) had a pressure-lowering surgical

274

intervention in at least one eye (laser peripheral iridotomy, selective laser trabeculoplasty, or

275

trabeculectomy). Neither of these variables showed a significant difference between the genetic

276

diagnosis groups (P=0.6665 and P=1.0000 respectively), even after adjusting for age at

277

recruitment (Table 2).

Discussion

289

Here we described an Australian nanophthalmos cohort of predominantly European ancestry in

290

which 53.8% (7/13) of families were explained by variants in MFRP or PRSS56, or 69.2% (9/13)

291

when including previously reported families with variants in TMEM98 or MYRF.23,28 Mean axial

292

length was shorter in all four groups of individuals with a genetic diagnosis compared to those

293

without, with the recessive PRSS56 and MFRP forms associated with the shortest axial length.

294

Similarly, hyperopia was higher in affected individuals with a known genetic diagnosis compared

295

to those without. This suggests that individuals with milder nanophthalmos phenotypes may be

296

explained by variants in other genes, and emphasises the importance of prioritising genetic

297

testing for MFRP and PRSS56 in individuals with the most severe nanophthalmos phenotypes.

298
299

All individuals with an axial length below 18 mm in their smaller eye had a genetic diagnosis

300

(17/17), with all but one under 17 mm associated with variants in either PRSS56 or MFRP

301

(10/11). Previous population studies have shown these thresholds to capture 0.137% (<18 mm)

302

and 0.05% (<17 mm) of an adult British population30, and we propose that these be considered

303

a threshold for identifying an underlying single gene cause.

304
305

PRSS56 was the most commonly implicated gene in this cohort (4/13, 30.8%) and in other

306

cohorts of posterior microphthalmos and nanophthalmos (27.3% - 61.5%).8,26,36 Including the

307

four described here, at least 32 pedigrees have been described with PRSS56-associated

308

posterior microphthalmos or nanophthalmos.8,15–17,26,35,36 Twenty of these pedigrees (62.5%)

309

share the same c.1066dupC frameshift insertion variant, or 55.6% (15/27) if one considers the

310

six Tunisian pedigrees with a shared haplotype as a single extended pedigree.17,35 Two of the

311

families reported here harbour the c.1066dupC variant on at least one allele, which lay on

312

haplotypes distinct from each other and from the previously reported Tunisian pedigree,

313

suggesting the existence of a mutational hotspot in PRSS56. These variants arose in the

314

context of an eight nucleotide cytosine mononucleotide repeat, which is incidentally a frequent

315

occurrence in MYRF-associated nanophthalmos and high hyperopia28, and is likely secondary

316

to slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication.37

317
318

While loss-of-function variants such as PRSS56:c.1066dupC are associated with reduced axial

319

length and hyperopia, variants that enhance the activity of PRSS56 might be expected to lead to

320

increased axial length and myopia. The p.(Ala30Thr) variant of PRSS56 is one of the few

321

protein-coding variants to have emerged from genome-wide association studies of refractive

322

error. Unlike the loss-of-function variants described here which associate with hyperopia,

323

p.(Ala30Thr) is associated with myopia, suggesting that it may increase axial length through a

324

gain-of-function mechanism.20 PRSS56 itself is a soluble serine protease, potentially sensitive to

325

protease inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies, and therefore would be a candidate therapeutic

326

target in the treatment of refractive error. It has already been shown that deletion of Prss56 can

327

reduce axial length and correct refractive error in an Egr1 mutant mouse model of myopia18,

328

raising the possibility that PRSS56 inhibitors might be applied to the treatment of myopia in

329

humans.

330
331

In summary, we present the genetic landscape of nanophthalmos in an Australian cohort,

332

revealing a considerable overlap between genes associated with rare and common refractive

333

error phenotypes. The shortest axial length and most extreme hyperopic refractive error were

334

associated with autosomal recessive forms of nanophthalmos (PRSS56 and MFRP), with a less

335

extreme phenotype in autosomal dominant forms (TMEM98 and MYRF). Finally, we

336

demonstrated that the most frequent single variant associated with nanophthalmos across all

337

ancestries, PRSS56 c.1066dupC, is likely to have arisen independently in at least four different

338

populations, highlighting the importance of a single mutational hotspot in the global prevalence

339

of nanophthalmos.
