Abstract

18

During sexual transmission, the large genetic diversity of HIV-1 within an individual is frequently

19

reduced to one founder variant that initiates infection 1. Understanding the drivers of this bottleneck is

20

crucial to develop effective infection control strategies 2. Genetic characteristics of the potential founder

21

viruses and events in the recipient partner are both known to contribute to this bottleneck, but little is

22

understood about the importance of the source partner 3. To test the hypothesis that the source partner

23

affects the multiplicity of HIV founder variants, we developed a phylodynamic model calibrated using

24

genetic and epidemiological data on all existing transmission pairs for whom the direction of transmission

25

and the infection stage of the source partner are known. Our results demonstrate the importance of

26

infection stage of the source partner, and not exposure route, in determining founder variant multiplicity.

27

Specifically, acquiring infection from someone in the acute (early) stage of infection increases the risk of

28

multiple variant transmission when compared with someone in the chronic (later) stage of infection. This

29

study provides the first direct test of source partner characteristics to explain the low frequency of

30

multiple founder strain infections and can inform clinical intervention study design and interpretation.

31

Main

32

Sexual transmission of HIV-1 results in a viral diversity bottleneck due to physiological barriers as well

33

as viral or cellular constraints that prevent most genetic variants within the source partner from

34

establishing onward infection 1,4,5. Indeed, this diversity bottleneck results in around three quarters of new

35

infections being founded by a single genetic variant 2,6–10. The extent of genetic diversity transmitted to a

36

new partner is a crucial determinant in understanding the efficacy of putative vaccines and may shed light

37

on the transmission of drug resistance to treatment naive individuals.

38
39

The factors leading to the diversity bottleneck during sexual transmission can be broadly categorized as

40

those determined by the source partner—such as viral load and viral diversity available for transmission,

41

those determined by the recipient partner—such as target cell type and availability in the genital or rectal

42

mucosa (e.g. 3,5,11), and those connected with viral characteristics—such as glycosylation profiles and cell

43

tropism (reviewed in 12). While the impact of the recipient partner and the characteristics of transmitted

44

variants have been widely discussed, little is known about how the source partner affects the viral

45

diversity bottleneck. In particular, despite the importance of infection stage as a driver of HIV

46

transmission—that is, the length of time between the source partner becoming infected and transmission

47

to their partner—there is no empirical evidence to suggest how this influences the viral diversity

48

bottleneck. This gap has arisen because analyses are routinely conducted on individuals without

49

information on the partner from whom they acquired infection. Phylogenetic analyses now offer a

50

possible solution to this impasse.

52

Phylogenetic trees are representations of the ancestral relationships of organisms with the tips of the tree

53

representing those that are sampled, the internal nodes their inferred common ancestors, and the branches

54

as the evolutionary pathways between these actual and inferred individuals. When phylogenetic trees are

55

constructed using sequence data from both partners in an HIV transmission pair, the relationship between

56

the evolutionary histories of both set of viral samples may reflect epidemiological relationships between

57

the two individuals 13–15. Previous modelling studies suggest that by assigning the relationship between

58

the evolutionary histories of both partners as one of three topology classes—monophyletic-monophyletic

59

(MM), paraphyletic-monophyletic (PM), or a combination of paraphyletic and polyphyletic (PP)—

60

epidemiological information can be inferred, such as the direction of transmission 13, as well as

61

evolutionary information, such as determining the number of transmitted variants 16. That is, the number

62

of monophyletic clusters in a PM (one) or PP (more than one) tree can be interpreted as the minimum

63

number of transmitted lineages (Fig. 1A). In practice, however, many factors may influence

64

epidemiological interpretations from phylogenetic trees such as sampling times, sampling density of the

65

viral populations and phylogenetic signal 17,18.

66
67

Here we present a data-driven phylodynamic approach to overcome these empirical and methodological

68

issues to evaluate the impact of the source partner’s infection stage and route of exposure on the HIV

69

diversity bottleneck (Fig. 1B,C). We first retrieved all available genetic and epidemiological information

70

from published HIV sexual transmission pairs where the direction of transmission is known, and kept for

71

further analysis those pairs for whom transmission could be classified as having occurred in the source

72

partner’s acute stage (≤90 days after his/her infection) or chronic stage (later than 90 days after his/her

73

infection). After further stratifying pairs into heterosexual (HET) and men-who-have-sex-with-men

74

(MSM) risk groups, we found a significant difference in the timing of transmission between the two risk

75

groups. Specifically, 10 of 36 MSM pairs were the result of acute stage transmission compared with 1 of

76

76 of HET pairs (Fig. 2).

89

We then performed Bayesian phylogenetic tree reconstruction on the genetic sequences of the

90

transmission pairs and classified the topology class of each tree in the posterior distribution as

91

monophyletic-monophyletic (MM), paraphyletic-monophyletic (PM) or paraphyletic-polyphyletic (PP).

92

The most likely topology class was PM (65% and 61% for HET and MSM, respectively), but with a

93

higher number of PP trees in the MSM group (P=0.056, Fig. 2). This result has previously been reported

94

as indicative of a higher number of founder variants for MSM 16. However, when we stratify the topology

95

class by whether the source partner was in acute or chronic infection at the time of transmission, our

96

results indicate that the infection stage of the source is the primary driver for any observed differences in

97

topology class. Specifically, there is no difference between the HET and MSM groups in the PM/PP

98

topology class ratio when transmission occurs in the chronic stage of infection (P=0.570). Note that only

99

one HET transmission occurs during the acute stage, and the topology class for this pair is PP. These

100

results remain qualitatively consistent when only data were analysed from the 66% of transmission pairs

101

for whom the posterior trees gave a certainty of over 95% for the most frequent topology class (Fig. S3).

102

These results indicate that infection stage of the source partner, and not risk group per se, influences the

103

diversity bottleneck at transmission.

104
105

To test whether these empirical findings are indicative of a smaller diversity bottleneck in the chronic

106

stage of HIV infection, we developed a phylodynamic framework in which we simulated the

107

epidemiologic characteristics of each HET and MSM transmission pair, the timing of their sequence

108

sampling, the transmission of virus particles, and the within-host genetic evolution in both the source and

109

recipient (Fig. 1B). Specifically, using the epidemiological information from the transmission pairs, we

110

simulated phylogenies under a coalescent model before generating genetic sequences from these

111

simulations and performing Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic reconstruction on these simulated

112

sequences. We classified each of these simulated trees as MM, PM or PP and determined the frequency of

113

each topology class for each simulated transmission pair across all the simulated sequences. However, as

114

we could not directly observe the number of virus particles that are transmitted between source and

recipient, we repeated the simulation of phylogenetic trees for each transmission pair under a range of

124

plausible values of virus particles transmitted. By fitting the simulation output topology class distribution

125

to the topology class distribution from the empirical phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood

126

inference, we then determined the most likely number of transmitted virus particles for each transmission

127

pair and used this best fit model for further analysis. Note that two or more virus particles may have the

128

same genetic sequence, and would constitute a single founder variant (or haplotype), discussed later.

129
130

Our fitting procedure selects a best fit model that clearly delineates between transmission pairs between

131

whom one virus particle is transmitted (75% of pairs) and those between whom more than one virus

132

particle is transmitted (25% of pairs, Fig. 3A). While there is a high degree of confidence in the result

133

when one particle is transmitted, there is often uncertainty around the exact number when multiple

134

particles are transmitted (Fig. 3A). Importantly, we found acute stage transmissions are less likely to lead

135

to single particle infections compared with chronic stage transmissions (27% vs. 80%, P = 0.0005). The

136

topology class of the simulated phylogenetic trees is strongly influenced by the number of virus particles

137

being transmitted (Fig. 3B). PM trees are more commonly found in the pairs that are better described by a

138

model with a single transmitted virus particle (81%) whereas PP trees appeared more often when multiple

139

particles are likely to have been transmitted (86%).

140
141

For each transmission pair, we then simulated the genetic sequences of the transmitted viral population

142

under the best fit virus particle model and calculated the most likely number of transmitted variants for

143

each transmission pair. The median number of variants transmitted across all pairs is 1 (range: 1-11, Fig.

144

4A). Using the full distribution of founder variant multiplicity for each pair, we also calculated the

145

probability that a single founder variant was transmitted to the respective recipient. Our results suggest

146

that across all pairs in both risk groups, the mean probability of observing one founder variant is 0.73.

147

Stratifying by risk group, we find there is a higher probability that one variant founds HET infections than

148

MSM infections (a geometric mean of 0.80 vs. 0.63, Fig. 4B). However, these risk group differences

149

mostly disappear when we stratify the results by the infection stage of the source. Here, for example,

150

when only chronic stage transmissions are considered, the probability of one founding variant is a little

151

higher for MSM transmissions than for HET transmissions (means of 0.80 vs 0.71), and the pairwise

152

diversity at transmission is similar between both groups (Fig. 4C). In contrast, when stratifying solely by

153

infection stage of the source partner, we find that transmission during the acute stage has a much lower

154

probability of one founder variant than during the chronic stage (means of 0.40 vs. 0.77) with a higher

155

median number of variants transmitted, when only the most likely multiplicity for each pair is considered

156

(2 vs. 1, Fig. 4A). Nonetheless, if multiple variant transmission does occur, our results suggest that the

157

number of founder variants is higher during chronic stage transmission, consistent with a higher diversity

measure during this later stage of infection (Fig. 4C).

FIGURE 3: The estimated number of transmitted virus particles for the 112 transmission pairs. The estimates

162

of transmitted virus particles for each transmission pair were calculated by choosing the model simulation that

163

generated a phylogenetic tree topology class distribution (that is, the number of MM, PM and PP trees constructed

164

from the simulated genetic sequences) that best matched the topology class distribution from the phylogenetic trees

From these results, therefore, there is approximately double the chance of multiple variant transmission

during acute stage infection across both risk groups (relative risk = 0.52). Assuming that transmission

risk is weighted towards early transmission such that half of all index case to source partner transmissions

174

occur after 90 days of index case infection leads to qualitatively similar results (Supplementary

175

Information). Similarly, calibrating the simulation model to bootstrapped samples rather than Bayesian

176

posterior distributions leads to similar results (Supplementary Information).

177
178

Our results suggest that there is an association between tree topology class and multiple variant

179

transmission, with 95% of MM and PM trees being due to one founder variant (Fig. 4D). However, the

180

number of embedded recipient clades is not always a proxy for the minimum number of founder variants

181

transmitted. For example in chronic stage transmission, 11% of PP topology class trees were due to single

182

variant transmission (Fig. 4D). Across both infection stages, we find that if MM, PM or PP is assigned as

183

the most likely tree topology class, then 92%, 96% and 15% of transmissions are due to a single founder

184

variant, respectively.

185
186

We have used a combination of empirical data and phylodynamic model simulation to evaluate the role of

187

infection stage at transmission and route of transmission on the number of virus particles transmitted

188

during sexual HIV exposure. This makes three important advances on previous work. First, it is the first

189

empirically-based study that fits a model to data to understand the role of the source partner in

190

establishing infection. Second, while we use previously developed topology classification of phylogenetic

191

trees to understand HIV transmission pairs, we extend this methodology by calibrating a phylodynamic

192

model to empirical data. This new approach provides a means to validate the untested assumption that the

193

number of embedded recipient partner lineages in a phylogenetic tree directly corresponds to the

194

minimum number of founder variants transmitted. Third, our phylodynamic model explicitly incorporates

195

virus particle number and the identity of genetic sequences. Previous work has shown that the multiplicity

196

of founder variants has little impact on the topology class of the phylogenetic tree when only overall

197

genetic diversity, rather than sequence identity, is tracked 13.

207

208

The relative importance of acute and chronic stages of HIV in determining both the number of virus

209

particles and the number of variants transmitted is consistent with a recent modelling study 19. However,

210

our study finds higher proportions of infections initiated by multiple variants overall during these two

211

stages. This difference is likely due to the assumptions related to how the stages of infection are defined

212

as well as the relative importance of transmission during late infection. Specifically, the previous

213

modelling study finds that two thirds of multiple variant transmission occurs during the pre-AIDS stage of

214

infection which is assumed to have both a high viral load and large haplotype diversity. If later stages of

215

infection account for disproportionately less transmission then the previous model would predict higher

216

proportions of multiple variant transmission in both the acute and chronic stages of infection, becoming

217

more consistent with empirical estimates from our analysis. By contrast, our study is agnostic about the

218

relative importance of early and late transmission and does not differentiate between chronic and a pre-

219

AIDS stage of infection, which can not easily be identified through analysis of empirical data.

220
221

Data from four of the MSM transmission pairs in this study have previously been used to estimate the

222

number of variants founding infection using a combination approach of single genome amplification

223

(SGA), direct amplicon sequencing and mathematical modelling 9 This previous analysis broadly agrees

224

with our results, with two recipients likely infected with one founder variant, one recipient with one to

225

two founder variants and one recipient with two to three variants. Small differences likely arise because

226

this study uses sequence data from both partners to evaluate the multiplicity of founder variants in the

227

recipient partner. These extra data can be used to parameterize a mathematical model that accounts for the

228

evolutionary relationship between the virus samples from both partners, rather than relying solely on

229

accumulating diversity. Specifically, neglecting the extent of genetic similarity between the source and

230

recipient virus samples might misattribute borderline cases of diversity accumulation.

231
232

Our study finds a median of one founder variant and a maximum of 11, with little difference between

233

HET and MSM risk groups. When only multiple variant transmissions are considered, our study finds a

234

median of 2-3 founder variants. These values are consistent with a previous pooled analysis using results

235

from four analyses that used the current gold-standard SGA combination approach as above 9.

236
237

There are two primary limitations to acknowledge. First, our model assumes a single transmission event

238

between each source and recipient partner. Without detailed knowledge of the transmission pairs, we

239

cannot distinguish between multiple infections each with a single variant and a single infection with

240

multiple variants. Second, our phylodynamic framework does not account for the effect of selection and

241

recombination. Specifically, selection, such as that for viruses which use the CCR5 co-receptor 20, is

242

thought to occur at the point of transmission , although the strength may be dependent on the route of

243

transmission 21.

244
245

Our study finds that HIV-1 founder variant multiplicity is determined by infection stage of source partner,

246

with higher founder variant multiplicity of HIV-1 in acute compared with chronic infections. These

247

findings stress the importance of the stage of infection at transmission as an important mediating or

248

confounding factor when assessing the role of sexual risk group in HIV epidemiology.

Methods

250

Data collation on linked transmission pairs

251

We automatically retrieved all HIV sequence data for men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) and

252

heterosexual (HET) HIV transmission pairs for whom the direction of transmission is reported from The

253

Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HIV sequence database up to February 2019, such that each

254

transmission pair comprise a ‘source’ and a ‘recipient’ partner (Supplementary Information). For each

255

partner in the transmission pair we collected the following clinical and epidemiological data: (i) date of

256

infection or time of infection prior to sampling, (ii) date of seroconversion or date of seroconversion prior

257

to sampling, (iii) Fiebig stage at the time of sampling, (iv) date of sampling or time of sampling prior to

258

infection, (v) number of sequences, (vi) genomic region, (vii) HIV subtype, and (viii) reported risk group.

259

For each set of these transmission pair data we estimated, relative to the transmission time to the recipient

260

partner (time = 0): (i) the time of transmission to the source partner, (ii) the time of the sampling of the

261

source partner, and (iii) the time of sampling for the recipient partner (Fig. 1, Supplementary

262

Information). We excluded all transmission pairs from further analysis for whom these three times could

263

not be determined, for whom a risk group was not provided, for whom either partner has fewer than five

264

sequences for all sampling times, or for whom the pair did not have a LANL cluster ID. For our base case

265

analysis, we used the longest available genomic region with five or more sequences per partner. If more

266

than one sampling time is available for any of the individuals, we selected the sample closest in time to

267

the recipient transmission.

Tree reconstruction: For each of the included transmission pairs, we generated posterior sets of

we built phylogenetic trees with MrBayes 3.2.7 24,25 under the assumption of a general time-reversible

274

(GTR) nucleotide substitution model with the addition of invariant sites (I) and a gamma distribution of

275

site rates. We constrained sequence data to be monophyletic with respect to the reference sequences to

276

root the tree but ingroup relationships were unconstrained to avoid any topology class bias. We ran two

277

Markov chains each with 30 million iterations, from which we sampled every 3,000th after discarding the

278

first 50% as burn-in which provided an average standard deviation of split tree frequencies of below 0.01

279

or an effective sample size of greater than 300. This gave an empirical posterior distribution of N = 5,000

280

sample trees. In a sensitivity analysis, we tested the alternative method of using maximum likelihood

281

phylogenetic tree reconstruction with bootstrapping.

282
283

Empirical topology class: We classified each of the resulting phylogenetic trees in the posterior

284

distribution as either monophyletic-monophyletic (MM), or paraphyletic-monophyletic (PM), or

285

paraphyletic-polyphyletic (PP), to reflect the cladistic relationship between the lineages from both

286

individuals (Supplementary Information). Each transmission pair,!, is then described as a triplet of

287

probabilities, !! , denoting the frequency of each topology class within the !th pair’s posterior

288

distribution Dk = {!! (!)}! ∈! = {Pr (! | !)}!∈! where

!∈! Pr

! ! = 1 and ! ∈ {MM, PM, PP}.

Simulated transmission pair analysis

291

We simulated the transmission of virus particles and within-host evolution, accounting for the

292

epidemiological characteristics for each transmission pair. For each transmission pair, we simulated a

293

chain of three HIV infections: (i) an unsampled index case who infected the source after three years of

294

their own infection during their chronic stage to reflect that the majority of both HET and MSM

295

transmission pairs transmitted during the chronic stage (101/112 pairs). In a sensitivity analysis we

296

accounted for the assumption that transmission rate may be higher during the acute stage, with half of the

297

index to source transmissions occurring after 90 days and the remaining half after three years, (ii) the

298

source individual of the transmission pair, and (iii) finally the recipient individual of the transmission

299

pair. For each individual within each trio, we simulated viral phylogenies that reflect between- and

300

within-host viral evolution using VirusTreeSimulator 26, using as input the respective epidemiological and

301

clinical information (Supplementary Information). We used a within-host effective population size

302

consistent with that parameterized by the PANGEA-HIV study with the following logistic model

303

parameters: initial effective population size (!! ) is 1, viral generation time (!) is 1.8 days, effective

304

population per year growth rate (!) is 2.85022, and time to half the carrying capacity of the viral

305

population (!!" ) is 2 years 26. For each transmission pair, we simulated a dated viral phylogeny that has

306

the same number of tips as the number of retrieved sequences per partner and that is sampled at the

307

respective sampling times for the source and recipient partner (Supplementary Information). For each

308

recipient partner infection, we assume that a total of !! virus particles founded the infection. For each

309

simulation, we further assume a total of !! virus particles founding infection of the source. We assume !!

310

takes values between one and a maximum of 12 and varied !! between one and two (Supplementary

311

Information). We assume that the virus samples from each recipient is representative of the within-host

312

diversity, and that each founding virus particle has an extant lineage. Therefore, we first assigned each

313

sample (tip) of a phylogeny as a descendant of one of the !! virus particles. If there were more than 12

314

samples then the remaining tips were assigned randomly to the !! = 12 virus particles. If there were

315

fewer than 12 samples, then we constrained the number of founding virus particles, !! , to equal the

316

number of samples. For every transmission pair, and for each value of !! and !! , we simulated 100 viral

317

phylogenies.

318
319

For every simulated viral phylogeny, we simulated transmitted sequences by adding dummy nodes with a

320

negligibly short branch length after the transmission time. We then simulated the evolution of nucleotide

321

sequences along the tree using Seq-Gen 27 and a GTR + I + gamma substitution model. The length of the

322

simulated sequences and the evolutionary tree scaling rate match each transmission pair’s empirical

328

Simulated topology class: We reconstructed a phylogeny using maximum likelihood inference in IQ-

329

TREE 1.6.11 29 and selected the best-fit nucleotide substitution model with ModelFinder 30. Each

330

phylogeny was classified as either MM, PP or PP (Supplementary Information). Consequently, for each

331

transmission pair ! and each transmissibility model (i.e. number of viral particles founding infection of

332

the recipient !! ), we generated a triplet of probabilities !!,!! = !!,!!

! !, !! = 1 and ! ∈ {MM, PM, PP}.

334
335

Transmissibility model calibration

336

For each transmission pair, we chose the most likely value of !! (the number of virus particles founding

337

each recipient infection) by matching the posterior topology class from the empirical phylogenetic

338

transmission trees with the simulated distribution of topology class. Specifically, for each transmission

339

pair, !, we estimated the most likely number of viral particles founding each recipient infection !R∗ as the

340

!! that maximises the multinomial likelihood function

341

!!,!! = Pr !! !!,!! =

342

lower and upper confidence limits for !R∗ as the minimum and maximum values of !! that satisfy

343

!!,!! > !!,!R∗ − 1.92 and !!,!! < !!,n∗R + 1.92, respectively 31. For each transmission pair !, we retain

344

the best fit model for further analysis such that there are !R∗ viral particles founding infection of the

recipient.

Probability of a single founder haplotype: For each transmission pair, !, from the best fit transmissibility

348

model, we defined the random variables !!! and !!! as the number of haplotypes that found infection of

349

the source and the recipient partners, respectively. We then calculated the probability of there being a

350

single founder haplotype in the recipient, stratified by topology class of the simulated phylogenetic tree

351

(MM, PM, PP) and the number of founder haplotypes, i, in the source partner, !!! (!), that is, !!! ! =

352

Pr (!!! = 1|!!! = !, !) . Next, we defined the probability of a single founder haplotype in the recipient as

353

a function of a tree topology, t, ! ! ! = Pr !!! = 1 ! = !!! Pr !! = 1 + !!! Pr (!! > 1). By assuming

354

that the source partners are randomly selected from the general MSM or HET population in which the

355

probability of a single founder strain has been calculated to be approximately 0.7 19, we set, Pr(!S = 1) =

356

0.7 and Pr !S > 1 = 0.3. Finally, for each transmission pair, we calculated the probability of one

357

founder haplotype given the observed triplet of empirical posterior topology classes !! , as ! ! =

! !! (!)/! .

359
360

Founder haplotype multiplicity by source partner infection stage: We stratified all the transmission pairs

361

into two sets by the infection stage of the source partner. We classified the acute transmission set as those

362

pairs for whom recipient infection is within 90 days of source infection (a set of nacute pairs), and the

363

chronic transmission set as those pairs for whom recipient infection is 90 days or later after source

364

infection (a set of nchronic pairs). For each group, we calculated the mean probability of one founder

365

haplotype being transmitted to the recipient in each set as:

Epidemiological data and sequence retrieval

9

For the ease of replicating our results and using existing transmission pair data for other purposes, we

10

developed a Python script to automatically retrieve epidemiological and metadata for each transmission

11

pair from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database (LANLdb). This script downloads

12

the following data from both the source and recipient partners to a .csv file using as input the cluster and

13

patients ids from LANLdb: (i) time of infection, (ii) time of seroconversion, (iii) Fiebig stage at the time

14

of sampling, (iv) number of sequences, (v) genomic region, (vi) HIV subtype, (vii) reported risk group

15

and (viii) GenBank accession IDs.

16
17

Next we used the downloaded GenBank accession IDs to automatically retrieve (ix) viral genetic

18

sequences and (x) sampling dates (calendar dates) from GenBank using an R script. If information from

19

(i) to (x) were missing for any individual, we manually retrieved these values from the original

20

manuscripts where possible.

21
22

Completed datatables from these automatic and manual processes are provided at

25

Epidemiological data pre-processing

26

For each transmission pair, we define time = 0 as the time of recipient infection. We then calculated,

27

using the data table retrieved, i) the time of infection of the source, ii) the time of sampling of the source,

28

iii) the time of sampling of the recipient.

29
30

To estimate these times, we first calculated days from infection for both the source and the recipient

31

partners. When these values are not given explicitly, we calculated them from time since seroconversion

32

estimates or from Fiebig staging results. Specifically, we interpret (Cohen et al. 2010) seroconversion as

33

the individual reaching Fiebig stage III (ELISA positive) that occurs between 22-37 days after infection

34

(Cohen et al. 2010) and Fiebig stages I (viral RNA positive) and II (18-34) occurring 13 days and 28 days

35

after infection, respectively. For all the pairs where a range of possible values is calculated, and for when

36

a calendar month is provided, we incorporated the uncertainty around the infection and sampling times by

37

assuming all values in these ranges are equally plausible and uniformly sampled within these range to

38

account for the uncertainty.

39
40

For some pairs, the source was classified as ‘recent’ or ‘late’ at the time of transmission to the recipient

41

partner. In these cases, we do not have an exact point to call time = 0. Therefore, for these pairs, for each

42

simulation, we sample with replacement the time between source and recipient infections from the other

43

pairs for whom we have previously classified as acute (<90 days delay), and chronic (90 days or more

44

delay), sampling from the same risk group (MSM or HET) in each case.

45
46

All calculations, corresponding notes and final transmission times for each pair are provided at

47

58

On average, 22 (IQR 13-33) HIV sequences are obtained from the source and 21 (IQR 10-20) sequences

59

from the recipient for the MSM pairs, and 21 (IQR 12-25) and 18 (IQR 9-22) for the HET source and

60

recipient, respectively. All MSM sequence data belong to subtype B, while most heterosexual sequence

61

data belong to subtype C (49%), followed by subtype B (22%), subtype D (21%), subtype A/A-like (7%)

62

and unclassified subtype (1%). A total of 7 (19%) of the MSM pairs have near full genomes sequenced

63

and the remaining pairs had env available (mean 1653 nt, range 182-3827 nt). Ten (13%) of the HET pairs

64

had near full genomes available, while 56 (75%) pairs had env (mean 1321 nt, range 323-2582 nt), nine

65

(12%) pairs had either pol or gag (mean 1484 nt, range 1375-1499 nt) and one pair had vif-LTR3 (4666

66

nt) sequenced.

67

Effect of number of founding virus particles in the source

68

To assess whether the number of founding virus particles in the source partner affects the diversity of

69

sequences founding infection in the recipient, we model a scenario where the index case transmitted one,

70

two or six virus particles to the source partner at either one or three year(s) after infection. The source in

71

turn transmits 1 to 6 virus particles to the recipient at 30 days (acute) or 1095 days (chronic) later. The

72

simulation produces a dated viral phylogeny with tips sampled at either 30 (early) or 1065 days (late).

73

We model 1kb nucleotide sequences along the simulated viral phylogenies using the same method as in

The genetic variation rapidly and steadily increases over time⏤the maximum diversity among

transmitted haplotypes to the recipient was higher when the index case was infected for longer and the

transmission to the recipient occurs during the chronic stage of the source (Fig. S2). When the source has

more than one founding particle, this leads to a bimodal distribution of maximum diversity among

80

transmitted variants within the recipient. The first and second mode represent maximum diversity when

81

drawing the recipient founder haplotypes from either one or more than one viral population within the

82

source, respectively. However, increasing the number of founding virus particles to more than two within

83

the source only increases the density around the second mode without affecting the range of the maximum

84

diversity distribution. This consistency occurs because increasing the number of founding virus particles

85

in both transmission partners, increased the probability of drawing founding variants from different

86

genetic pools in the source. However the average maximum diversity of the founder variants does not

87

change because the source genetic pools evolved at the same rate and under the same evolutionary

88

constraints with no selective advantage. This leads to genetic pools with equivalent cumulative genetic

89

change but distinct identity. Taking this into account, we chose to model one or two founding virus

90

particles within the source partner as we were interested in capturing some degree of variation in the

91

transmitted haplotypes rather than multiple genetic identities per se.

Effect of index partner stage of infection at transmission

110

In the main analysis we assumed that all index cases transmit to the source partner after three years of

111

infection. Here we also evaluated the results assuming the transmission risk was skewed towards early

112

infection, with half of all simulations across all transmission pairs assuming index case transmission

113

occurs during the acute stage (≤90d) and half occurs during the chronic stage (91d-3y). We find

114

qualitatively similar results as our main analysis. The median number of variants transmitted across all

115

pairs is 1 (range: 1-5, Fig. S4A). Across all pairs in both risk groups, the mean probability of observing

116

one founder variant is 0.73. Stratifying by risk group, we find there is a higher probability that one variant

117

founds HET infections than MSM infections (a geometric mean of 0.79 vs. 0.61, Fig. S4B). In contrast,

118

when stratifying solely by infection stage of the source partner, we find that transmission during the acute

126

stage has a much lower probability of one founder variant than during the chronic stage (means of 0.38

127

vs. 0.78) with a higher median number of variants transmitted, when only the most likely multiplicity for

128

each pair is considered (2 vs. 1, Fig. S4A). From these results, therefore, there is still approximately twice

129

the chance of multiple variant transmission during acute stage infection across both risk groups (relative

130

risk is 0.48).

Effect of constructing empirical data phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood inference with

132

bootstrapping

133

In the main analysis we used Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction to analyse the empirical sampled

134

genetic data of each empirical transmission pair, using the respective posterior distribution to calculate the

135

frequency of each topology class (MM, PM and PP) r. Here we provide a sensitivity analysis to calculate

136

the tree topology class distribution of the empirical sampled genetic data by maximum likelihood

137

phylogenetic tree construction and bootstrapping. After bootstrapping the empirical data 100 times to

138

calculate the frequency of MM, PM and PP topology classes for each transmission pair, we then

139

proceeded using the same methodology as in the main text. That is, we fit the simulation model

140

(parameterised with the pair-specific data) to the bootstrapped data individually for each transmission pair

141

by comparing the frequencies of tree topology classes. Overall our results remained consistent with our

142

main results, albeit with slightly lower probabilities of observing one founder variant. The median

143

number of variants transmitted across all pairs is 1 (range: 1-11, Fig. S5A). Across all pairs in both risk

144

groups, the mean probability of observing one founder variant is 0.62. Stratifying by risk group, we find

145

there is a higher probability that one variant founds HET infections than MSM infections (a geometric

146

mean of 0.67 vs. 0.53, Fig. S5B). Stratifying by infection stage of the source partner, we find there is a

147

much lower probability of one founder variant during the acute stage than during the chronic stage (means

148

of 0.31 vs. 0.66) with approximately twice the chance of multiple variant transmission during acute stage

149

infection across both risk groups (relative risk is 0.47).
