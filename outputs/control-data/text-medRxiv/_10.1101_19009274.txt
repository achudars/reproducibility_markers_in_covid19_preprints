Abstract

Background and aims
BRAF V600E mutations have been reported to be associated with sporadic microsatelliteunstable (MSI) colorectal cancer (CRC), while rarely detected in CRCs of Lynch syndrome (LS)
patients. Therefore, current international diagnostic guidelines recommend somatic BRAF
mutation testing in MLH1-deficient MSI CRC patients to exclude LS. As sporadic BRAF-mutant
MSI CRC is a disease of the elderly, while LS-associated CRC usually occurs at younger age,
we hypothesized that the efficacy of BRAF testing in LS diagnostics may be age-dependent.
Methods
We systematically compared the prevalence of BRAF V600E mutations in LS-associated CRCs
and MSI CRCs from population-based cohorts in different age groups as available from
published studies, databases, and population-based patient cohorts. Cost calculations and
sensitivity analysis of the BRAF testing for exclusion of LS was performed.
Results
Among 969 MSI CRCs from LS mutation carriers from the literature and German HNPCC
Consortium, 15 (1.6%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%) harbored BRAF mutations. 6/7 LS patients with
BRAF-mutant CRC and reported age were <50 years. Among unselected MSI CRCs, 44.8%
(339/756) harbored BRAF mutations, 92.3% (313/339) of which were detected in patients
>60 years. In MSI CRC patients <50, BRAF mutations were detected only in 0.6% (2/339), and
the inclusion of BRAF testing led to increased costs and higher risk of missing LS patients
(1.2%) compared to other age groups.
Conclusion
BRAF testing in patients <50 years is cost-inefficient and carries the highest risk of missing LS
patients among different age groups. We suggest direct referral of MSI CRC patients <50
years to genetic counseling without prior BRAF testing.

Lynch Syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome,
accounting for 2-3% of all CRC cases1,2. LS is caused mainly by heterozygous germline
mutations in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6)3.
Due to the inactivation of MMR proteins by a second somatic hit, LS-associated cancers
show MMR protein deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI). Therefore, testing for MSI
and MMR protein deficiency is commonly the first step in LS diagnostics 4. However, MSI in
tumor cells does not prove LS; in fact, most MSI tumors occur sporadically 5. Sporadic MSI
tumors commonly occur in older patients with marked predominance for female gender,
lack MLH1 protein expression due to MLH1 promoter methylation, and are strongly
associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and the serrated route of
carcinogenesis related to the activating hotspot oncogenic mutations in the BRAF gene
(c.1799 T>A p.Val600Glu, also called V600E)6. MLH1-deficient MSI CRCs per se are therefore
not highly suggestive of LS, particularly those diagnosed in the elderly.
With the expansion of recommendations to perform tumor testing for potential LS not only
in patients fulfilling Bethesda criteria7,8, but also in all CRCs/CRCs diagnosed before the age
of
709
(NICE
guidelines:
https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg27/chapter/1Recommendations), the need for additional markers differentiating LS from sporadic MSI
CRC increased. Such markers would reduce the number of MSI CRC patients referred to
germline mutation analysis, thus also reducing patients’ mental stress and healthcare
costs7,10,11. In an early attempt to identify such molecular markers, Deng et al. 12 suggested
the BRAF V600E mutation as a possible marker occurring in sporadic, but not LS-associated
MSI CRC.
The potential diagnostic value of BRAF V600E mutations to exclude LS has further been
supported by studies reporting a specificity of 100%11,13,14. Others, however, occasionally
detected BRAF mutations in LS-associated CRC15-17, according to a meta-analysis amounting
to a frequency of 1.4%18 . More recently, Thompson et al. reported BRAF mutations in 7
CRCs from LS patients in the Colon CFR (cancer family registry) dataset and estimated a
probability of 2.9% for the presence of BRAF mutations in LS CRC19.
We hypothesized that the predictive value of BRAF V600E mutation for the exclusion of LS
may depend on the age at diagnosis. We analyzed LS- and population-based databases to
determine the prevalence of BRAF mutations and the presence of LS germline mutations in
patients of different age groups.

Methods
A general outline of the study design is provided in Figure 1 A.
BRAF mutation frequency in LS-associated CRC
Data on the BRAF mutation status of CRCs from LS patients with proven pathogenic germline
mutations in one of the MMR genes were obtained from the central database of the German
HNPCC Consortium. All patients provided informed and written consent. The study was
approved by the institutional Ethics Committee.
In addition, a literature database (NCBI PubMed, Feb 15, 2019) search for publications that
included information on the BRAF mutation status of MSI cancers from patients with proven
germline mutations in one of the MMR-genes or clinically diagnosed Lynch syndrome was
performed according to PRISMA guidelines (Figure 1 B). The search terms "BRAF AND Lynch
syndrome AND colorectal" were applied and 241 entries were found. 176 studies were
excluded by title. 38 studies were excluded after full review due to lacking information on
clinical or genetic data on LS or to the exclusion of patients with BRAF-mutant CRC from
germline testing. One of the remaining entries included a literature review (Parsons et al.
201217) on BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer. Full text review of all studies cited therein
revealed 4 studies suitable for integration into our analysis which had not already been
retrieved by our literature review. Among the remaining 30 publications those not providing
information on the gene affected by the germline mutation were included into the
calculation of the BRAF mutation frequency in LS-associated CRC in general, yet excluded
from the calculations of the BRAF mutation frequency in specific germline mutations.
Calculated age-specific prevalence of BRAF-mutant LS CRC among all CRCs
The age-specific prevalence of LS CRC was taken from the largest population-based study on
the topic2. LS CRC is here defined as a CRC developing in a proven LS germline mutation
carrier. Given the age categories published, the prevalence of LS CRC among all CRCs was
calculated for age categories ≤50, 51-60, 61-70, and >70. Since age categories slightly
differed from that used to determine the frequency of BRAF-mutant MSI CRC (<50, 50-59,
60-69, ≥70), we compared the age-specific prevalence of LS CRC found by Moreira et al.2
with that of 3 other population based studies using age categories <501,20,21, and 50-5921. As
no significant differences were observed, we used the age categories <50, 50-59, 60-69, and
≥70 throughout our study.
The age-specific rate of BRAF-mutant LS CRC among all CRCs was calculated for each age
group using the definition of conditional probabilities:
𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝐿𝑆|𝐶𝑅𝐶) = 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡|𝐿𝑆, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) ⋅ 𝑃(𝐿𝑆|𝐶𝑅𝐶),
where 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡|𝐿𝑆, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) is assumed to be constant for all age groups. Given a CRC, the
term 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝐿𝑆|𝐶𝑅𝐶) describes the conditional probability that this CRC is BRAFmutant and LS-associated. The further probabilities are defined analogously.

cohorts

To determine the age-specific prevalence of BRAF mutations in unselected CRC specimens,
we used information from the DACHS cohort study 22-24 and the DFCI database
(www.cbioportal.org, Jan 04, 2018)25-27. The age distribution of patients with MSI and BRAFmutant CRC was determined in comparison to the age distribution of patients with MSS
BRAF-wild type (BRAF-wt), MSS BRAF-mutant, MSI BRAF-wt CRCs. The results of MSI and
BRAF mutation typing in the DACHS cohort have been published in a previous study 28.
In addition, we performed a literature review (NCBI PubMed, Feb 15, 2019) of publications
that included information on the BRAF mutation status of MSI and MSS cancers according to
age groups (Figure 1 C). The search terms "BRAF AND population AND colorectal cancer AND
Lynch syndrome" and "BRAF AND population AND colorectal cancer AND microsatellite
instability were used. A total of 188 entries were retrieved. Among these, 157 studies mainly
reporting on cost effectiveness and degree of diagnostic application were excluded by title.
Of 31 entries with full text review 24 were excluded since the age specific prevalence of
molecular subtypes (MSI BRAF-mutant, MSI BRAF-wt, MSS BRAF-mutant, MSS BRAF-wt) was
not given. Owing to the major use of age categories <50, 50-59, 60-69, and ≥70 years for the
7 studies used we adapted information of both DACHS and DFCI database to these age
groups.
All 95% confidence intervals were calculated with the modified Wald method.
Calculation of potentially missed cases
By only testing BRAF-wt MSI CRCs for LS, a certain number 𝑛𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑑𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 of LS patients may
be missed. This corresponds to the number of BRAF-mutant LS CRC cases among all MSI
CRCs. It is computed for each age group by
𝑛𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑑𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 = 𝑛𝑀𝑆𝐼𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 ⋅ 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝐿𝑆|𝑀𝑆𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶),
where 𝑛𝑀𝑆𝐼𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 is assumed to be constant for each age group.
Given an MSI CRC, the term 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝐿𝑆|𝑀𝑆𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) represents the conditional
probability that the given MSI CRC is BRAF-mutant and LS-associated.
By this and using the definition of conditional probabilities, we calculated
𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝐿𝑆|𝑀𝑆𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) =

𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡,𝐿𝑆|𝐶𝑅𝐶)
𝑃(𝑀𝑆𝐼,𝐶𝑅𝐶)

.

The denominator is given by the observations from the literature reviews mentioned in the
previous section, namely by adding the frequencies of BRAF-mutant MSI CRCs and BRAF-wt
MSI CRCs among all CRCs
𝑃(𝑀𝑆𝐼|𝐶𝑅𝐶) = 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝑀𝑆𝐼|𝐶𝑅𝐶) + 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑤𝑡, 𝑀𝑆𝐼|𝐶𝑅𝐶).
Calculated percentage of MSI CRC excluded from MMR gene germline mutation analysis
due to BRAF mutation
Instead of performing a germline mutation analysis for all MSI CRC samples, we only test
BRAF-wt MSI CRCs for LS. Thus, the percentage of BRAF-mutant MSI CRCs among all MSI
CRCs is excluded from MMR gene germline mutation analysis, which can be computed by

.

Cost calculations for both diagnostic algorithms
We assumed a constant number of MSI CRC cases 𝑛𝑀𝑆𝐼𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 to be tested in each age
group. By performing MMR gene germline analysis for all MSI CRCs, the following costs for
the first diagnostic algorithm will arise:
$𝐷𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐1 = 𝑛𝑀𝑆𝐼𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 ⋅ $𝑔𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑠 ,
which is constant for all age groups due to our assumptions.
For the second diagnostic algorithm, all MSI CRCs are first tested for BRAF mutations. Then,
only for the BRAF-wt MSI CRCs MMR gene germline analysis is performed. This leads to the
following costs:
$𝐷𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐2 = 𝑛𝑀𝑆𝐼𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 ⋅ ($𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 + 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑤𝑡|𝑀𝑆𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) ⋅ $𝑔𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑠 ),
which we calculated for different cost ratios of germline analysis and BRAF testing

Results
Prevalence of BRAF mutations in LS CRCs
In the present study (see Figure 1A for the study outline), we first aimed to determine the
BRAF mutation prevalence in patients with LS CRC. Data on the BRAF mutation status of 98
CRCs from proven carriers of a pathogenic LS germline mutation were available in the
German HNPCC Consortium 29,30. Those comprised 74 MLH1, 14 MSH2, 4 MSH6, and 6 PMS2
mutation carriers. Two BRAF-mutant CRCs were identified (2.0%, 95% CI: 0.1-7.6%): one in
an MLH1-deficient (1.3%, 1/74) and one in an MSH2-deficient (7.1%, 1/14) cancer. Both
patients were <50 years at the time of CRC diagnosis.
To validate these results, a literature search was performed to determine BRAF mutation
prevalence in LS-associated CRC (Figure 1B). The literature review revealed 30 publications
with data on BRAF mutations in LS-associated CRC. BRAF mutation data were retrieved for
969 LS CRCs, and data on the MMR gene affected in the germline were available for 832 of
them (Table 1). BRAF mutations were reported in 9 studies for 15 cancers, encompassing 8
MLH1-deficient (including one germline epimutation carrier31), 2 MSH2-deficient and 5
PMS2-deficient CRC (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).
The overall frequency of BRAF mutations in LS was 1.6% (15/969, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%), with a
frequency of 1.7% (95% CI: 0.8-3.3%) among MLH1-deficient CRCs (8/482), 0.7% (95% CI: 02.9%) among MSH2-deficient (2/269), and 9.3% (95% CI: 3.6-20.3%) among PMS2-deficient
CRCs (5/54). No BRAF mutations (0%, 95% CI: 0-14.8%) were found among CRCs from MSH6
mutation carriers (0/27). Among BRAF-mutant LS-associated CRCs, data on age at diagnosis
was available for 7 patients (4 MLH1, 1 MSH2, 2 PMS2 mutation carriers). All except one
mutation carrier with a PMS2 germline mutation were <50 years.
Age-specific prevalence of BRAF mutations in MSI CRCs
To analyze the age-specific prevalence of BRAF mutations in MSI CRCs we used two
independent cohorts: population-based DACHS cohort 22-24 and publicly available DFCI set2527.
Data on BRAF mutation and MSI status in the DACHS cohort were available for 2046
patients, of which 93 were found to have BRAF-mutant MSI CRC. BRAF-mutant MSI CRC was
associated with advanced age in this cohort (median age 75). From 93 BRAF-mutant MSI
CRCs, 90 (96.8%) were from patients ≥60. The prevalence of BRAF mutations in MSI CRCs
𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡|𝑀𝑆𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) of the different age groups were 0 (0%) out of 14 in patients <50, 3
(12.0%) out of 25 in patients 50-59, 25 (41.7%) out of 60 in patients 60-69, and 65 (50.8%)
out of 128 in patients ≥70 years at diagnosis (Supplementary Table 2, 3).
For independent validation, we next analyzed the age-specific prevalence of BRAF mutations
in MSI CRC using DFCI cohort. Here, data on BRAF mutation and MSI status were available
for 528 patients, 53 of which had a BRAF-mutant MSI CRC. The association of BRAF with
older age could be confirmed: median age of patients with BRAF-mutant MSI CRC was 73
years, with 51 out of 53 patients (96.2%) being ≥60. Notably, in both cohorts combined, 141
(96.6%) out of 146 BRAF-mutant MSI CRCs were from the group of patients ≥60
(Supplementary Table 2, 3).

To increase the representativeness of the age-specific prevalence of BRAF-mutant MSI CRC
among all MSI CRC and further validate the obtained results, we combined the DACHS and
DFCI data with the results of 7 previously published studies providing information on the
age-dependent prevalence of BRAF mutations in MSI CRC (Figure 1C, Supplementary Table
3).
Among unselected MSI CRCs, BRAF mutation frequency 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡|𝑀𝑆𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) was 1.6%
(2/124) in patients <50, 20.2% (24/119) in those 50-59, 59.2% (109/184) in those 60-69, and
62.0% (204/329) in patients ≥70. 92.3% (313/339) of BRAF mutations were observed in
patients >60, whereas only 0.6% (2/339) were documented in patients <50, consistent with
our findings from public datasets (Supplementary Table 3).
Among all CRCs, the overall prevalence of BRAF-mutant MSI cancers
𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝑀𝑆𝐼|𝐶𝑅𝐶) was 0.2% (2/1096) in patients <50, 1.4% (24/1731) in those 50-59,
6.8% (109/1607) in those 60-69, and 8.4% (204/2441) in those ≥70 years (Figure 2,
Supplementary Table 3).
Comparison of the calculated number of BRAF-mutant LS CRC and the number of actually
identified BRAF-mutant MSI CRCs according to age groups
According to population-based data2, the age-specific prevalence of LS in CRC patients
𝑃(𝐿𝑆|𝐶𝑅𝐶) is 8.4%, 2.9%, 1.4%, and 0.8% for patients ≤50, 51-60, 61-70, and ≥71,
respectively. These data indicate that in contrast to the frequency of BRAF-mutant MSI CRCs
among all CRCs, which increases with age, the prevalence of LS among all CRC patients
decreases with age (Figure 2).
To estimate the potential risk of missing LS by applying BRAF mutation testing in MSI CRCs of
the different age groups, we used the calculated frequency of BRAF-mutant LS CRC among
all CRC 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝐿𝑆|𝐶𝑅𝐶) for the considered age groups and applied it to the number
of patients observed in the age-specific MSI and BRAF-typed cohorts. Using this approach,
we compared the calculated number of BRAF-mutant LS CRC cases with the observed
number for each age group: In patients 60-69 and ≥70, the calculated number of possible
BRAF-mutant LS CRC was very low compared to the number of observed BRAF-mutant MSI
CRCs (0.4 vs. 109 and 0.3 vs. 204, respectively), indicating that the risk of false-negative
results for LS detection by BRAF mutation testing is very low in these age groups. However,
in patients <50, the calculated number of BRAF-mutant LS CRC almost equaled the number
of observed BRAF-mutant MSI CRCs (1.5 vs. 2), suggesting a considerable risk of falsenegative LS detection if BRAF mutation testing is applied (Table 2).
The calculated risk of potentially missed cases according to age groups
Further, the percentage 𝑃(𝐵𝑅𝐴𝐹𝑚𝑢𝑡, 𝐿𝑆|𝑀𝑆𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶) of MSI CRCs potentially excluded from
MMR gene germline mutation analysis due to BRAF mutation is also age-dependent. In
patients <50 years only 1.6% of all MSI CRCs are BRAF-mutant, meaning that here only for a
very minor proportion of patients the efforts and costs of further MMR gene germline
analysis can be saved. However, this proportion increases with age, i.e. in patients 50-59
20.2%, in patients 60-69 59.2% and in patients ≥70 62.0% of germline analyses can be saved
(Figure 3).

Cost efficiency of BRAF mutation testing according to age groups
We calculated the relative costs of performing BRAF mutation testing of all MSI CRCs
followed by MMR gene germline analysis for BRAF-wt MSI CRCs only (diagnostic algorithm 2,
see Methods), accounting for a range of possible cost ratios between BRAF mutation testing
and MMR gene germline sequencing. As a reference, we always used the diagnostic
algorithm 1 of performing MMR gene germline analysis for all MSI CRC patients (Figure 4). In
general, the costs for diagnostic algorithm 2 $𝐷𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐2 decrease with age (Figures 4A, 4B).
Considering different cost ratios for BRAF mutation testing and germline analysis, the overall
costs for diagnostic algorithm 2 are lowest if BRAF mutation testing is cheap (Figures 4A, 4C).
Importantly, in patients <50 algorithm 2 does not save costs for any considered cost ratio. In
patients >60 years, the BRAF mutation testing leads to a cost reduction for all cost ratios
with most pronounced effects in MSI CRC patients ≥70 (Figures 4A, 4B), whereas in patients
diagnosed in the range of 50-59 years the cost efficiency of BRAF mutation testing depends
on the cost ratio.

Discussion
In the present study we analyzed the age-dependent efficacy of BRAF mutation testing for
the exclusion of LS, including cost efficiency calculations and possible false-negative result
rates. The results of the present study for the first time demonstrate that BRAF mutation
testing in patients below the age of 50 is not justified.
We found that 92.3% of the MSI CRCs with a BRAF mutation were diagnosed in patients >60.
Only 0.6% of BRAF mutations in MSI CRCs were detected in patients <50. As the percentage
of BRAF-mutant tumors among MSI CRCs diagnosed in patients <50 was 1.6%, more than 60
tumors need to be tested to identify one BRAF mutation. Evidently, BRAF mutation testing is
not cost-effective in this age group, but may substantially delay the LS diagnostics flow.
We analyzed two independent cohorts (DACHS and DFCI) and further validated the findings
by a systematic literature review. Notably, data from a total of 6875 CRC patients showed a
very high congruency of age distributions between all examined data sources, supporting the
strong association of BRAF mutations in MSI CRC patients with advanced age at diagnosis.
Our data also demonstrate that BRAF mutation testing in patients <50 has a substantial risk
of erroneously excluding LS mutation carriers from further germline MMR gene diagnostics
and genetic counseling: First, reports of BRAF mutations occurring in MSI CRCs from LS
germline mutation carriers often refer to patients <50; second, the calculated frequency of
BRAF-mutant tumors in LS CRCs from patients <50 closely matches the observed frequency
of BRAF mutations in MSI CRCs of the same age group, suggesting a substantial overlap and
the risk of missing patients who have LS. The number of missed LS cases due to BRAF
mutation testing might even be underestimated, as BRAF mutation status may have been
used to exclude LS in some of the included studies. Prospectively, studies applying universal
germline mutation analyses without pre-selecting based on BRAF status are highly
encouraged in order to identify the true proportion of BRAF-mutant LS tumors.
Even if patients <50 with a BRAF-mutant MSI CRC may not have LS, they may still suffer from
other inherited tumor syndromes. Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is an as yet
incompletely understood disease associated in part with germline mutations in senescencerelated and DNA damage response genes, such as RNF4332,33. Cancers in SPS frequently
follow the same BRAF-mutant and MLH1-silencing pathway as sporadic late age at onset
CRCs34,35. SPS, formerly known as hyperplastic polyposis syndrome, is still underdiagnosed.
Therefore, thorough genetic counseling and diagnostics is encouraged in MSI CRC patients
<50 with BRAF mutations, instead of excluding them from germline analysis for hereditary
CRC.
Whereas BRAF mutation testing, independent from the applied method, clearly is not costeffective in MSI CRC patients <50, the situation in patients between 50 and 60 is less clear.
Here, a potential cost reduction depends on the relative cost ratios between BRAF mutation
testing and MMR gene germline mutation. Using a wide range of cost ratios between these
two analyses, we found that a cost reduction can be achieved in patients between 50 and 60
years whenever BRAF mutation testing costs less than 20% of the price for MMR gene
germline mutation analysis.

For patients >60, we could confirm previous reports suggesting BRAF mutation testing as a
useful tool in LS diagnostics: Here, BRAF mutation testing has a low risk of erroneously
excluding LS patients from germline MMR gene mutation analysis, but offers a significant
cost reduction across all cost ratio scenarios.
Our study has strengths and limitations. Strength is the large number of data from CRCs
collected in population-based cohorts mirroring the situation in daily practice. Moreover,
our study for the first time dissects the efficacy and appropriateness of BRAF mutation
testing for the exclusion of LS according to patients’ age. In addition, we provide cost
efficiency estimation for the inclusion of BRAF mutation testing of MSI CRCs in LS diagnostic
algorithms by relating the cost increase inferred by BRAF mutation testing to the potentially
saved costs of MMR gene germline mutation testing.
One limitation of our study is our presumption that the BRAF mutation frequency in LS CRC
remains stable over time. We could not deduce more precise estimates from the so far
published literature, as published data were not specific enough. Some overlaps of tumors
reported in different studies can also not fully be excluded. In addition, for all cost
calculations we had to assume application of BRAF mutation testing for all MSI CRCs, not for
MLH1-deficient CRCs only, as data in the literature on MMR protein status was absent for a
substantial number of tumors. As the majority of MSI CRCs from older patients are MLH1deficient36 this does not have a major effect here. In young patients, however, only about
50% of MSI CRCs are MLH1-deficient21,37,38. Using BRAF mutation testing for the exclusion of
LS only selectively in MLH1-deficient cancers would therefore approximately halve the
additional costs introduced by BRAF mutation testing in the LS diagnostic algorithm,
however, not alter the limited value of BRAF mutation testing because of the virtual absence
of BRAF mutations in young patients.
In conclusion, our data show that BRAF mutation testing for the exclusion of LS is costinefficient and misleading in MSI CRC patients <50 years, although being effective in older
age groups. We recommend reconsidering LS diagnostic guidelines, directly channeling MSI
CRC patients <50 years to genetic counselling without prior BRAF mutation testing.

of missing LS by using BRAF mutation testing for the exclusion of LS increases (1.2% in patients < 50

mutation costs relative to costs of MMR gene germline mutation analysis. In addition to failure of
BRAF mutation testing with regard to cost reduction, implementation of BRAF mutation testing in
patients younger than 60 years also has the risk of missing hereditary cancer patients (see also Figure
2).
