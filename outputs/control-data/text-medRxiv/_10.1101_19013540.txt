Abstract
Background. Changes in cellular metabolism are a hallmark of cancer and are linked with
sphingolipid synthesis. Due to immense interest in how sphingolipids influence chemoresistance,
more is known about the impact of sphingolipids during cancer treatment and progression than
about the potential role of sphingolipids in the induction of tumors in humans.
Methods. Because estrogen triggers sphingolipid signaling cascades, the causal role of
circulating levels of sphingomyelin (a type of sphingolipid) on breast cancer was investigated
with a well-powered Mendelian randomization design.
Results. The results reveal a null effect (OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.85, 1.05; P = 0.30).
Conclusion. Despite the role sphingomyelins play during chemoresistance and cancer
progression, circulating sphingomyelins do not appear to initiate or protect from breast cancer.
Impact. This finding comprises the first causal report in humans that sphingomyelins on breast
cancer initiation is null. Future investigations of risk in other cancer types are needed to further
explore the potential role of sphingolipid biology in cancer etiology.

Changes in cellular metabolism are a hallmark of cancer1. Sphingolipids can control the rate of
cell proliferation during malignant transformation and affect chemoresistance2. Sphingomyelin is
a type of sphingolipid, a class of lipids containing sphingoid bases (Fig. 1). As a response to
cellular stress, sphingolipids mediate apoptosis and autophagy, through the synthesis and/or
accumulation of ceramide. Ceramide can be hydrolyzed from sphingomyelin3. Due to immense
interest in how sphingolipids influence chemoresistance, much is known about the impact of
sphingolipids on cancer treatment and little is known about role sphingolipids in the induction of
tumors in humans.
Estrogen triggers sphingolipid signaling cascades2. Due to this, it was hypothesized that
circulating sphingomyelins might be involved in acquisition of breast cancer. The causal impact
of circulating levels of sphingomyelins on risk for breast cancer was appraised with Mendelian
randomization (MR).

Materials and Methods
Conceptual framework. MR is an instrumental variables technique; i.e., genetic variants
(typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) strongly associated with traits are used in
statistical models instead of the traits themselves. This avoids most environmental sources of
confounding and averts reverse causation, which preclude causal inference in observational

studies. Two-sample MR is an adaptation of the procedure that uses summary statistics from two
genome-wide association (GWA) studies5.
Mendelian randomization assumptions. MR depends on the validity of three assumptions: (i)
the SNPs acting as the instrumental variables must be strongly associated with the exposure; (ii)
the instrumental variables must be independent of confounders of the exposure and the outcome;
and (iii) the instrumental variables must be associated with the outcome only through the
exposure.
Data sources.
Step 1. Kettunen et al. (2016) performed a genome-wide association (GWA) study of 123
circulating metabolites—including sphingomyelins—in European participants (n=13,476 for
sphingomyelins)6. From this, independent (those not in linkage disequilibrium; R2 < 0.01) SNPs
associated at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) with a standard-deviation (SD) increase in
circulating sphingomyelins were identified. The Kettunen GWA is available through MR-Base
(http://www.mrbase.org/)5.
Step 2. A publicly available GWA study of breast cancer performed by the Breast Cancer
Association Consortium (BCAC) on 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls of
European ancestry was chosen as the outcome GWA for breast cancer7
(http://bcac.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/).
Statistical approach. A seven-SNP instrument for circulating sphingomyelins was constructed
from the SNPs strongly associated with circulating sphingomyelin levels. Estimates of the
proportion of variance in circulating sphingomyelins explained by the genetic instruments (R2)
and the strength of the association between the genetic instruments and breast cancer (F-statistic)

were generated (conventionally F-statistics <10 are weak). The instrument for sphingomyelins
has an R2 = 0.032 and the F-statistic = 1089. The study was powered using the mRnd MR power
calculator (available at http://cnsgenomics.com/shiny/mRnd/). It had >90% power to detect an
OR of 0.90.
The log-odds for breast cancer per SD increase in circulating sphingomyelins was calculated,
using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR method. The “TwoSampleMR” package5 was
used for the MR analysis.
All described analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2.
Sensitivity analyses. Several sensitivity estimators can be used appraise pleiotropic bias. Three
were chosen to complement the primary IVW causal tests: MR Egger regression, weighted
median, and weighted mode estimations. In addition to these sensitivity estimators, a test for
heterogeneity was performed, since variability in the causal estimates between SNPs can indicate
pleiotropy. The test for heterogeneity was performed using Cochrane’s Q-statistic.
Results
There was a null effect for circulating sphingomyelins on breast cancer (OR = 0.94; 95% CI =
0.85, 1.05; P = 0.30). The sensitivity estimators had effect estimates in the same direction and
were of comparable magnitude to the IVW estimate, indicating no evidence for substantial bias
due to unwanted pleiotropy. There was no evidence for heterogeneity in the estimates (Table 1).
The MR-Egger intercept test, which provides an assessment of potential directional pleiotropy in
the IVW was null. A null effect indicates a lack of evidence for pleiotropy (Estimate = 1.01; 95%
CI = 0.97, 1.04; P =0.55).

Discussion
This is the first causal report in humans that sphingomyelins on breast cancer initiation is null.
The null effect might reflect the complex interplay of pro-apoptotic and pro-growth ceramides8,
perhaps with greater upregulation of the pro-apoptotic pathways, which may be different for
different tissues. Future investigations of risk in other cancer types are needed to further explore
the potential role of sphingolipid biology in cancer etiology.
