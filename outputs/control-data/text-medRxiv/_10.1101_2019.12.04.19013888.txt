Abstract
Social skills group training (SSGT) is one of the most frequently used behavior
interventions in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Current
evidence suggests that the effects are moderate and heterogeneous. Genetic
predisposition could be one of the factors contributing to this heterogeneity. Therefore,
we used polygenic risk score (PRS) and gene-set analysis to investigate the association
between SSGT response and common variants in autistic individuals. Participants from
the largest randomized clinical trial of SSGT in ASD to date were selected for
genotyping. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), and educational attainment (EA) were calculated, and their
associations with the intervention outcome at post-intervention and follow-up were
tested using mixed linear model. In addition, thirty-two gene sets within five categories
(synaptic, glial, FMRP, glutamate, and mitochondrial) were selected to evaluate their
role in the intervention outcome. Individuals with higher PRSs for ASD and ADHD
had inferior response after SSGT. After multiple test correction, significant results were
kept for higher ADHD PRS at follow-up (β = 6.67, p = 0.016). Five gene sets within
synaptic category showed modest association with reduced response to SSGT in ASD.
Taken together, we provided preliminary evidence that genetic liability calculated using
PRS and common variants in synapse gene sets could influence the outcome of SSGT.
Our results hold promise for future research into the genetic contribution to individual
response to ASD interventions, and should be validated in larger cohorts.

Introduction
The response to behavioral interventions varies between individuals with the same
neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. One of the factors contributing to this
heterogeneity might be genetic predisposition. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have been used to pinpoint common variants, with mostly small effects,
associated with disorders or personality traits across a genome. For behavioral
interventions, the size of available cohorts with detailed outcomes is limited, and to
date no significant variants have been identified to be associated with outcome for any
specific interventions using GWAS. However, the use of polygenic risk score (PRS),
an aggregate measure of the cumulative effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) derived from GWAS, has provided promising results in psychiatry both for
behavioral and pharmacological treatments1–5. For instance, PRS has been studied to
predict the response to cognitive behavior therapy in major depressive disorder2. In
addition to PRS, gene-set analysis can be utilized to group multiple genetic variants in
genes and further to related gene sets to unravel biological process and cellular
functions related to intervention responses. Relevant gene set associations have been
identified for interventions in psychiatry6–10. For example, genetic variations in genes
underlying glutamatergic or NMDA neurotransmission have been implicated in shortterm antipsychotic medication efficacy in schizophrenia and calcium signaling pathway
has been indicated in response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in obsessivecompulsive disorder8,10.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
impairments in social communication and interaction, together with restricted,
repetitive behaviors11. ASD commonly co-exists with other neurodevelopmental and
psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety,
depression, and intellectual disability12. The genetic knowledge in ASD has increased
rapidly in recent years. For numbers of the individuals with ASD, rare genetic variants,
such as loss-of-function variants and copy number variations (CNVs) in specific genes
and loci, can indicate a molecular etiology13. In addition, common variants have been
shown to be of causal significance in the disorder14–16. Although there are only few
genome-wide significant SNPs identified for ASD, the cumulative polygenic variation
summarized by PRS has shown to be predictive of ASD and autistic traits in the general
population17,18. Studies have also indicated shared genetic liability of polygenic risk in
ASD and psychiatric disorders19,20. Educational attainment (EA), defined as the highest
degree of education, also has a confirmed genetic correlation with ASD21 and academic
achievement has been linked to social skills22. Both rare and common genetic variations
in ASD have shown to converge to specific gene-sets such as synaptic formation and
targets of the Fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP)23,24. To date, there are no
studies investigating how the already implicated common genetic variation in ASD
would relate to intervention outcomes in autistic individuals.

Social skills group training (SSGT) is one of the most frequently used behavioral
interventions in ASD, aiming to alleviate social communication difficulties in verbal

individuals within normative intellectual range in a group setting. The largest
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of SSGT (“KONTAKT”) to date, conducted by our
center in Sweden, included children and adolescents with ASD and at least one common
neurodevelopmental or psychiatric comorbidity25, such as ADHD, anxiety and
depression. SSGT as an add-on to standard care was found to have a small to moderate
effect compared to standard care only, with significant effects on the primary outcome
limited to adolescents (13-17 years) and females25.

We recently showed that autistic individuals who were carriers of clinically significant
and rare genic CNVs larger than 500kb had significantly inferior outcomes after SSGT
within the RCT26. Here, we expand our genetic investigations to test the association
between SSGT intervention response in ASD and common variants using PRS and
gene-set analysis. We hypothesized that PRSs for ASD, ADHD, and EA, as well as
common variants within known ASD gene sets, would influence the response to SSGT.
Additionally, we tested if there was a significant correlation with the clinical measures
of SRS, ADHD diagnosis and IQ in our clinical ASD cohort with the selected PRS. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the influence of common
variants on SSGT response in autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders. Our
results will provide further evidence of potential use of genetic profiles to predict
individual-level outcomes for ASD interventions.

Study individuals
The original multicenter, randomized pragmatic RCT of SSGT (“KONTAKT”)
recruited participants from 13 child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in
Sweden between August 2012 and October 2015. A detailed description of the inclusion
and exclusion criteria have been earlier described by Choque-Olsson et al25. In short,
296 children (7–12 years) and adolescents (13–17 years) with a diagnosis of autism,
atypical autism, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise
specified using ICD-10 criteria were included in the trial27. All participants had fullscale IQ > 70 according to the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and at least one
common comorbid psychiatric diagnosis of ADHD, depression, or anxiety disorder
according to ICD-1027,28. During the 12-weeks trial, the standard care group (n=146)
received any ongoing support or intervention, and the remaining 150 participants were
included in the active SSGT condition. The parent-reported Social Responsiveness
Scale (SRS) assessing autistic-like traits was used as the primary intervention outcome
measure. The SRS is a 65-item Likert-type scale generating totals scores ranging
between 0 and 195, with higher score indicating greater autism trait severity29. SRS was
recorded for each individual at baseline (pre-intervention), 12 weeks (post-intervention),
and 3-month after the end of the intervention (follow-up).
Participants who contributed saliva samples and had the primary outcome measure
recorded at either post-intervention or follow-up were included in this study. After
selection, clinical data and samples from 207 participants (SSGT group: 105, standard
care group: 102) were used for genotyping as described in elsewhere26.

Ethics
Written informed consent from the parents or legal guardians and verbal consent from
the children and adolescents was collected. All the protocols and methods in this study
were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial and sample collection
were approved by the ethical review board in Stockholm (Dnr 2012/385-31/4) and the
clinical authorities of the two involved counties. The trial was registered online
(NCT01854346).

Genotyping and quality control
DNA collection, extraction, and genotyping procedures are described elsewhere in
detail26. In short, the genotyping was done on the Affymetrix CytoScan™ HD
microarray platform, containing 743 304 SNP probes, in two separate batches. Data
from genotyping were transformed from Affymetrix .CEL format to .tped format using
“Affy2sv” package v1.0.14 in R. Position of each SNP was located based on microarray
annotation reference file (version NA32.3). Quality control (QC) of the data using
PLINK v1.90 was performed on per-individual basis within each genotyping batch to
remove poorly genotyped individuals and on per-marker QC to exclude low-quality
markers following a published protocol30,31. Individuals with discordant sex,
heterozygosity rate > 3SD, individual genotype failure rate > 0.03, and relatedness were
removed. Ancestry of the participants was estimated using principle component
analysis (PCA) in EIGENSOFT v7.2.1. We restricted our analyses to European ancestry.

Thus, individuals were excluded based on two largest principle components (principle
component 1 < 0.00, principle component 2 < 0.05). Additionally, the largest four PCAs
were added in the statistical model to adjust for ancestry. As no batch effects were
detected, the qualified data were combined to clean low-quality markers with following
criteria: minor allele frequency < 0.05, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium < 1e-06, individual
missingness < 0.1, and marker missingness < 0.05.

Imputation
We used the 1000 Genomes phase III haplotype data including all ancestries as a
reference genome. SNPs passing QC were separated into autosomes, and haplotypes
were inferred based on reference panel using SHAPEIT v232. For each phased autosome,
imputation was performed in 5Mb windows using IMPUTE2 v2.3.233,34. All imputed
regions were combined for post-imputation QC. Imputed SNPs were filtered using
following metrics: info score < 0.8, minor allele frequency < 0.05, Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium < 1e-06, marker missing rate < 0.05, and individual missing rate < 0.1.
SNPs were intersected together after post-imputation QC using both SNPTEST v2.5.5
and PLINK v1.9031,35.

Polygenic Risk Score calculation
To calculate the PRSs for ASD, ADHD, and EA, we used the latest GWAS summary
results from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium16,36,37. To minimize different population
effects, we included only individuals with European ancestry from the GWAS reference

samples. The estimated odds ratio and P-value of each SNP allele were used from each
reference set. SNPs in both reference and our in-house data were pruned using clumping
with a cutoff of r2 >= 0.1 within 500 kb window. PRS was calculated based on
independent SNPs using five P-value thresholds (Pt) (< 0.01, < 0.05, < 0.1, < 0.5, < 1)
selected from three reference sets, with higher Pt incorporating more SNP effects.
Allele numbers at each SNP (0, 1, 2), weighted by the natural logarithm of the allelic
odds ratio were summed to calculate an accumulative effect across the genome1,38. PRS
was then standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1) to test for association. All calculations were
conducted using PRSice v2.1.439.

Gene sets generation
Reference gene sets were obtained based on a previously published study24. Thirty-two
gene sets within five categories: synaptic (1047 genes), glial (240 genes), FMRP (1809
genes), glutamate (156 genes), and mitochondrial (132 genes) were included. SNPs
were annotated to genes based on European population from 1000 genomes and gene
locations, Build 37.

Statistical analysis
PRS association
We used mixed linear model (MLM) to identify the effect of PRS on the SSGT response.
Three time-points (pre-, post-intervention, and follow-up), as well as two study groups
(SSGT and standard care) were included to test the interaction effect of

PRS*time*intervention. Based on our previous studies25,26, factors associated with
inferior intervention outcomes were younger age (children), male gender, and CNV
carrier status (large size CNVs (> 500kb) and clinically significant CNVs). Therefore,
age group, gender, and population stratification of the four largest PCAs were added as
fixed factors in the model. Additionally, the clinical centers and each individual were
used as random factors. Carrier status of large size CNVs and clinically significant
CNVs were also added as fixed factors in separate models comparing with the model
without CNV adjustment. Marginal R2 for fixed effect and conditional R2 for fixed and
random effects were assessed to explain the role of PRS on the variance of treatment
outcome. For each phenotype on each Pt, both marginal and conditional R2 were
derived from the difference between model with PRS and model without PRS,
performed by “MuMIn” package v1.43.6 in R40. Beta and 95% confidential interval (CI)
were estimated from MLM to evaluate the interaction effect of PRS with SSGT and
standard care at different times. After false-discovery rate multiple corrections among
three PRSs, original P-values under 0.0167 were considered significant41. In addition,
two-sided student’s t-test and Pearson correlation were used to examine the correlation
between PRS and closely related characteristics, including PRS for ADHD and ADHD
comorbidity status, PRS for EA and IQ level, and PRS for ASD and ASD severity (SRS
score at pre-treatment). All analyses were performed in R v3.4.2.

Gene sets association
MAGMA v1.0.6 was used to perform gene and gene-set analysis42. Linear regression

was chosen to identify the effects of common variation within specific gene sets on
intervention outcome. The changes of SRS score between post-intervention or followup and pre-intervention were used as regression outcomes. Age, gender, four largest
PCAs and CNV carrier status (large size CNVs and clinically significant CNVs) were
added in the model as cofactors. The estimated effect size of competitive test and Pvalue on each gene set were obtained followed by multiple testing correction with
positive effect size indicating a decreased effect of the SSGT response.

Results
Sample characteristics
Samples of 188 participants passed genotyping QC, of which 99 belonged to active
SSGT. When comparing the individuals of this RCT subgroup with the total cohort
from the RCT25, we did not detect any differences in characteristics between these
individuals and those not passing genotyping QC (Supplementary Table 1). The final
genotype data sets consist of 539 106 SNPs after genotyping marker QC and 5 126 694
SNPs after imputation QC.

Correlation between PRS and related characteristics
The correlation between ADHD comorbidity status and PRS for ADHD, preintervention SRS and PRS for ASD, as well as IQ and PRS for EA were tested
(Supplementary Figure 1). No correlation was observed in ASD PRS and baseline SRS
(Supplementary Figure 1A). However, autistic participants with ADHD comorbidity

had higher ADHD PRS compared with participants without ADHD (Pt = 0.1, p = 0.010;
Pt = 0.5, p = 0.0075; Pt = 1.0, p = 0.0077) (Supplementary Figure 1B), and IQ was
positively correlated with PRS for EA (Pt = 0.05, p = 0.038; Pt = 0.1, p = 0.024; Pt =
0.5, p = 0.014; Pt = 1.0, p = 0.012) (Supplementary Figure 1C).

Proportion of variance in SSGT outcome explained by PRS
For the model examining the effect of PRS for ASD, the largest explained marginal and
conditional variance in the SSGT outcome was Pt 0.5 when controlling for the clinically
significant CNVs (Figure 1). We detected only small differences in the explained
variance when testing for ADHD PRS at all Pt (Figure 1). For EA PRS, increasing
values of marginal and conditional R2 occurred with higher Pt, in which Pt 1.0 explained
the most variance. All three tested models showed similar results (Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure 2).

Association between PRS and SSGT outcome
The PRS calculated from the Pt which had the highest explained variance for each
phenotype is shown as main result (Figure 2). Associations for all Pts in three models
are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Inferior outcomes after SSGT were implicated in
individuals with higher PRS for ASD on Pt 0.5 (β = 6.47, p = 0.019) and Pt 1.0 (β =
5.93, p = 0.031) at follow-up. However, the associations were not significant after
multiple testing correction. For ADHD PRS, participants with higher score also
improved less from SSGT on Pt 0.05 (post-intervention: β = 6.22, p = 0.019, follow-up:

β = 6.93, p = 0.012), Pt 0.1 (post-intervention: β = 6.22, p = 0.017, follow-up: β = 5.75,
p = 0.036) at both post-intervention and follow-up and Pt 0.5 (β = 6.00, p = 0.030), Pt
1.0 (β = 6.67, p = 0.016) at follow-up. After multiple testing correction, significant
association remained in the follow-up for ADHD PRS score at Pt 0.05 and Pt 1.0. No
significant effects were found for EA PRS.

Gene sets association with SSGT response
We tested if common genetic variation in five gene set groups and 31 ASD related gene
sets could explain SSGT outcome using competitive gene-set analysis. For the outcome
at post-intervention, four gene sets showed modest effect to cause significant inferior
outcome: intracellular signal transduction (large size CNVs: β = 0.204, p = 0.0027;
clinically significant CNVs: β = 0.202, p = 0.0029), cell adhesion and trans-synaptic
signaling (large size CNVs: β = 0.255, p = 0.0071; clinically significant CNVs: β =
0.247, p = 0.0090), excitability (large size CNVs: β = 0.268, p = 0.017; clinically
significant CNVs: β = 0.247, p = 0.026), GPCR signaling (large size CNVs: β = 0.255,
p = 0.023; clinically significant CNVs: β = 0.252, p = 0.024), all belonging to synaptic
group (Table 1). In follow-up, only RNA and protein synthesis, folding and breakdown
(RPSFB) (large size CNVs: β = 0.184, p = 0.030; clinically significant CNVs: β = 0.185,
p = 0.030) in synaptic group showed similar effect (Table 1). However, none of the gene
set results remained significant after multiple testing correction. The results for other
gene sets did not reach nominal significance (Supplementary Table 3).

Discussion
In this study, by calculating PRS and analyzing related gene sets, we tested if different
subsets of common variants and biological gene groups would influence the outcome
of SSGT. We showed that a higher common genetic variant load for ADHD and ASD
was negatively associated with the SSGT response in autistic individuals, albeit with
modest effects compared to rare CNVs impact we have shown before26. However, the
effect of PRS remained even when we controlled for rare CNV carrier status of the
individuals suggesting an independent role of PRS on the intervention outcome. We
also demonstrated significant correlations between PRS for ADHD and ADHD
comorbidity and PRS for EA and IQ level in our study cohort. Additionally, we showed
suggestive evidence that genes involved in synaptic functions could be important for
modulating the response to SSGT, as several gene sets important for synaptic functions
showed nominal significance to influence the SSGT outcome.

Given the high heterogeneity of responses to SSGT among individuals with ASD, it is
important to find factors influencing the outcome, which could be used to tailor the
interventions for each individual. Our results provided intriguing evidence that in
addition to the rare high impact CNVs, the polygenic contribution of common variants
could have a moderating role on SSGT outcome, especially the ADHD PRS. Highly
shared genetic heritability between ASD and ADHD has been reported in family
studies43,44, and genetic overlap between the two neurodevelopmental conditions is
evident from genome-wide correlation analysis21,45,46. A recent study has identified that

PRS for ADHD can be used to predict ASD-related measures such as pragmatic
language abilities47. Compared to ASD alone, having ASD and ADHD symptoms were
confirmed to be associated with greater impairments in socialization adaptive skills in
clinical presentation48. Based on genetic sharing between the two conditions, our results
highlight the connection between ADHD genetic information and ASD intervention
effects. Furthermore, the correlation between PRS and ADHD comorbidity indicates
that ADHD PRS could be used to evaluate liability to ADHD in individuals first
diagnosed with ASD.

Compared to the results of PRS for ADHD, we found only indicative association
between PRS for ASD and intervention outcomes. Currently, it is not known if the same
genetic factors would influence the risk of developing ASD and intervention response
measured here. In other disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), studies
have found variants associated with MDD can be either positive or negative for the
outcome of antidepressants49, and the results of PRS as a predictor of treatment outcome
are inconsistent50,51. Further studies should clarify how ASD PRS might modulate
intervention outcomes.

We did not find any association between PRS for EA and SSGT intervention response.
Studies using genetic correlation analysis corroborated interrelated results between
ASD and years of education and college attainment21,52. Some PRS studies suggest that
PRS for ASD is associated with EA52, and EA PRS is associated with lower

externalizing behaviors53, but no study has shown the prediction of autistic traits or
ASD-related interventions using PRS for EA. As expected, we found a positive
correlation between PRS EA and IQ in our sample, which is in accordance with other
findings in the general population54.

Interestingly, the inferior outcome for individuals with higher PRS for ASD and ADHD
seemed to be particularly pronounced at follow-up. A similar tendency was previously
also seen in individuals with clinically significant rare CNVs26. This suggest that
additional care during or after SSGT treatment should be considered for individuals
with higher genetic risk, as to alleviate the genetic influence on the intervention
outcome. Recently, a long version of SSGT intervention (24-week) was conducted
resulting in larger positive effects compared to the 12-week intervention55. Further
studies should investigate if genetic effects remain when the intervention dose is
increased.

Although no robust association after multiple testing corrections were shown for the
gene-set analysis, we found suggestive evidence that genes necessary for synapse
formation and maintenance may influence SSGT response. Since synapse formation
and synaptic plasticity have been indicated as one of the key neuronal mechanisms in
ASD, differences in these key steps in brain development could possibly play a major
role in how individuals respond to interventions56. Some aspects of treatment-induced
behavior improvement are also related to brain plasticity changes in psychiatric

disorders. For instance, significant increases of grey matter in left hippocampus and left
amygdala correlated with the degree of improved cognition are found in early-onset
schizophrenia individuals after two years of social skills group therapy and cognitive
remediation57.

We acknowledge the limitations of our study. First, the sample size from RCT is limited,
which restricted the precision of our analyses and precluded in-depth analysis of
complex pathways and single variants. Secondly, the analyzed sample included
individuals with normative IQ and common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
comorbidities, limiting the generalizability across the total population of autistic
individuals. Finally, studies have shown loci harboring common alleles are also
enriched for rare variants with large effects from whole-exome sequencing in
psychiatric disorders58. Although we have adjusted for the carrier status of rare CNVs,
other rare variants were not controlled for. In the future, more genetic information can
be combined to better understand their effect on SSGT outcome.

Conclusion
This is the first study showing that common polygenic risk, especially for ADHD, is
associated with SSGT response in ASD individuals, and gene sets from synaptic groups
may play a potential biological role in SSGT response. Replications including larger
sample size and combination of more genetic and clinical factors are needed to further
clarify the genetic influences and mechanisms behind individual intervention responses.
