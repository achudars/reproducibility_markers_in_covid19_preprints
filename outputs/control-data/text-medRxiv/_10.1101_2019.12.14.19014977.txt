Abstract
Background
Atopic dermatitis (AD) arises from a complex interaction between an impaired
epidermal barrier, environmental exposures, and the infiltration of
Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22 T cells. Transcriptomic analysis has advanced understanding of
gene expression in cells and tissues. However, molecular quantitation of cytokine
transcripts does not predict the importance of a specific pathway in AD or cellular
responses to different inflammatory stimuli.

Objective
To understand changes in keratinocyte transcriptomic programmes in human
cutaneous disease during development of inflammation and in response to
treatment.

Methods
We performed in silico deconvolution of the whole-skin transcriptome. Using coexpression clustering and machine learning tools, we resolved the gene expression
of bulk skin (n=7 datasets, n=406 samples), firstly, into unsupervised keratinocyte
immune response phenotypes and, secondly, into 19 cutaneous cell signatures of
purified populations from publicly available datasets.

Results
We identify three unique transcriptomic programmes in keratinocytes, KC1, KC2,
KC17, characteristic to immune signalling from disease-associated helper T cells.
We cross-validate those signatures across different skin inflammatory conditions and

disease stages and demonstrate that the keratinocyte response during treatment is
therapy dependent. Broad spectrum treatment with ciclosporin ameliorated the KC17
response in AD lesions to a non-lesional immunophenotype, without altering KC2.
Conversely, the specific anti-Th2 therapy, dupilumab, reversed the KC2
immunophenotype.

Conclusion
Our analysis of transcriptomic signatures in cutaneous disease biopsies reveals the
complexity of keratinocyte programming in skin inflammation and suggests that the
perturbation of a single axis of immune signal alone may be insufficient to resolve
keratinocyte immunophenotype abnormalities.

Introduction
Atopic dermatitis (AD) arises from a complex interaction between impaired epidermal
barrier and environmental exposures to allergens and irritants, resulting in aberrantly
activated infiltrating immune cells. Much interest has focused on the immune cells
infiltrating AD skin, which mediate the disease. In particular, dense infiltration of
activated Th2/Th22 CD4+ T cells has been observed as an early feature of AD
exacerbations, especially in acute lesions1. These are identified also in non-lesional
skin of AD sufferers suggesting a systemic immunodysregulation2,3. This implies that
type 2 cytokines play a major role in disease pathogenesis and clinical research has
shown the impressive efficacy in AD treatment of a monoclonal antibody therapy
targeting IL4Ra which blocks IL-4 and IL13 signalling4. However, studies by Gittler et
al. first demonstrated that the Th1/Th17 axis is also prominent in chronic AD lesions
and correlates with the magnitude of the Th2 signals5. Whilst various different T cell
pathways have been targeted in clinical trials of AD, the functional effects of the
inflammatory pathways on skin keratinocytes have largely been ignored6,7.

Alongside the immune skin infiltrate, spongiosis and keratinocyte hyperplasia are the
cardinal features of epidermal changes in AD. In addition to the gene mutation
mediated reduction of filaggrin expression, type 2 inflammation also reduces
keratinocyte filaggrin expression thereby further damaging the skin barrier8,9.
Importantly, beyond their role in maintaining the physical barrier of the skin,
keratinocytes also act as innate immune sentinels, and express pattern recognition
receptors, ligation of which regulates keratinocyte synthesis of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antigen presentation to immune cells10–16.

The role of IL-17 and IL22 cytokines in regulating antimicrobial peptides such as
s100 proteins and b-defensins is well established17–22 and the importance of these
pathways in psoriasis has been validated by clinical demonstration of effectiveness
of inhibitory monoclonal antibody therapy23,24; their precise function in AD is less
clear. To study the key pathways driving AD, where targeted intervention may prove
most fruitful, direct quantitation of the immune signals (e.g. cytokines) can be
undertaken. However, as molecular quantitation of the cytokine transcripts does not
predict the importance of a specific pathway in AD, it is necessary to study the
outcome of the epidermal responses to different inflammatory stimuli to properly
define their role. Thus, to characterise the keratinocyte immunophenotype it is
necessary to be able to investigate skin transcriptome to a cellular resolution.
Single-cell analysis can offer an approach to this question but is limited by the
technical challenge of achieving adequate encapsulation of enough cells of interest
with minimal transcriptomic disturbance. Here we show that it is possible to employ
machine learning to resolve the keratinocyte transcriptomic signal from the nonkeratinocyte skin transcriptome, revealing important insights to the pathogenesis of
AD.

Methods
Microarray data analysis
Microarray datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,
NCBI) and were analysed from raw data in R and normalised according to platform
specifics. For Affymetrix microarray platforms, classic microarray quality control was
performed using the Bioconductor arrayQualityMetrics tool and were normalised to
obtain expression values by GCRMA methods within the Affymetrix package.
Illumina platforms and other technologies were quantile normalised using the lumi or
limma Bioconductor packages.

Unsupervised network clustering
The inflammatory skin disease datasets GSE32924, GSE36842 and GSE34248
were processed as above and subsequently merged and batch corrected using the
COMBAT tool within the SVA Bioconductor package. Differential gene expression
analysis between healthy controls and lesional skin, within disease lesional and nonlesional, and across disease lesional comparisons was conducted using a filtering of
Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value >0.05, log(2)-fold difference x1 using the
LIMMA Bioconductor package. The expression values of 4620 probset-IDs,
corresponding to 3066 unique genes were input into MIRU (now, GraphiaPro) for
network analysis25,26. A transcript-to-transcript correlation matrix using Pearson
correlation coefficient of r ³0.7 was created. The resulting network graph was then
clustered into groups of genes using the MCL algorithm at an inflation value of 3.1
and minimum cluster size of 10 genes, giving 50 clusters. The gene list for each
cluster was interrogated for gene ontology using the web-based analysis tool
ToppFun within the ToppGene suite27. The REVIGO online tool was used to provide

the lowest B.H. p-value and a term dispensability of zero.

Reference cutaneous cell populations datasets
To curate cell profiles for input as CIBERSORT reference signatures, we collated
seven datasets from GEO: GSE36287 (keratinocytes stimulated with IFNa, IFNg, IL13, IL-17A, IL-4, TNFa, and unstimulated control), GSE7216 (keratinocytes
stimulated with IL-1b ,IL-22, IL-26, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)), GSE34308
(dermal fibroblasts), GSE74158 (skin resident CD4, CD8 and regulatory T cells),
GSE4570 (melanocytes), GSE49475 (activated Langerhans’ cells, CD11c+ dermal
dendritic cells), and GSE23618 (steady-state Langerhans’ cells). Datasets were
normalised separately, and gene expression of sample replicates averaged by mean
before combining into a single file for upload to CIBERSORT as a signature genes
matrix. Gene replicates are discounted by CIBERSORT in favour of the gene with
the highest mean expression across the samples.

Bulk skin datasets
Datasets of skin biopsies from inflammatory skin diseases were obtained from GEO.
Four AD datasets and two psoriasis datasets were analysed. GSE32924 is a dataset
of paired chronic lesional (AD-ChL, n=11), non-lesional (AD-Non, n=11) atopic
dermatitis samples, and healthy controls (HH, n=8). GSE36842 is a dataset of acute
lesional (AD-AcL, n= 7), chronic lesional (AD-ChL, n=7), non-lesional (AD-Non, n=7)
skin from atopic dermatitis patients and healthy controls (HH, n=6). GSE58558 is a
longitudinal study of ciclosporin treatment of atopic dermatitis patients with biopsies
taken at baseline, 2 and 12 weeks of treatment of both chronic lesions (CAL:

of dupilumab or placebo treatment of atopic dermatitis patients with biopsies taken at

GSE34248 is a dataset of paired lesional (Ps-Les, n=14) and non-lesional (Ps-Non,
n=14) psoriatic samples. GSE11903 is a longitudinal study of etanercept treatment
of psoriasis patients with biopsies taken at baseline for lesional and non-lesional skin
(Ps-Les, n=11; Ps-Non, n=11) and biopsies from lesional skin at 1- (n=11), 2- (n=11),
4- (n=10), and 12 weeks (n=11) of treatment

Running CIBERSORT
Datasets of bulk skin samples were deconvoluted against the reference signature
sets using the online version of the CIBERSORT28 algorithm. Reference signature
files were provided as the signature gene file, while normalised expression data of
bulk samples were provided as the mixture file. All run settings were kept at default.
Output provided by CIBERSORT was downloaded as a .txt file, where relative
abundance of each cellular signature was normalised as a percent of sample.

Results
Gene co-expression analysis of inflammatory skin disease genes reveals
immune and keratinocyte involvement.
Firstly, we set out to examine the transcriptomic signals from skin biopsies of
lesional, regardless of chronicity, and non-lesional AD and psoriasis (AD-Les, ADNon, Ps-Les, Ps-Non, respectively). In line with previous reports, unsupervised
differential expression analysis identified 4620 genes3,29. Transcript-to-transcript
clustering (GraphiaPro, Pearson r >0.7, MCL=3.1, >10 clustered genes) identified 50
clusters (Figure 1a). Annotation revealed three clusters (11, 14 and 28) encoding
immune-related processes such as lymphocyte activation, interferon and cytokine
signalling (Figure 1f-h; Supplementary table 1). The relative expression pattern
across these clusters showed similar changes in lesions, regardless of disease, and
the least expression in healthy skin. Interestingly, AD non-lesional skin showed a
prominent defence response (cluster 28), suggesting a subclinical immune alteration
in non-lesional AD skin as compared to healthy skin3,30,31.

Strikingly, clusters 1, 6, 9 and 18 (Figure 1b-e; Supplementary table 1) were
enriched in biological processes characteristic for keratinocytes (KCs). Genes in
clusters 1 and 18 were most highly expressed in healthy tissue and represented
processes of epidermis development and skin development, respectively, suggesting
aberrant regulation of these processes in inflammatory skin disease. In contrast,
genes in cluster 9 showed strong correlation with expression of immune mediated
inflammation genes which suggests that the association may be causal. Cluster-tocluster gene expression by tissue showed high correlation (Pearson r-square >0.7
(data not shown)). It is notable that genes in cluster 9 include KRT6A/B, KRT16, and

the S100 and SERPIN encoding proteins which are known to be involved in
epidermal perturbation from inflammation and hyper-proliferative barrier breach2,32,33,
indicating that the cross-talk between immune inflammation and keratinocyte
function is important for lesion pathogenesis.

Machine learning resolution of whole skin samples into constituent cellular
profiles.
To resolve from bulk expression data the transcriptomic signatures of keratinocyte
responses we utilised a machine learning approach. We trained an algorithm
(CIBERSORT28,34) to resolve gene expression profiles of purified cellular populations
and tested this on whole tissue transcriptomic data from split skin (epidermis and
dermis) to identify the relative proportion of cells. We then utilised laser captured
dermal and epidermal regions from both healthy and AD skin35 to demonstrate that
the algorithm could reliably separate relative proportions of the keratinocyte and
fibroblast composition of whole skin in uninflamed and inflamed settings (Figure 2a,
b). We expanded this approach by utilising a training set of transcriptomes for
melanocytes, resident regulatory, CD4 and CD8 T cells, steady-state and activated
Langerhans cells, and CD11c+ dermal dendritic cells to increase the resolution of the
cellular skin components (Figure 2c).

In silico sorting reveals prevalence of KC2 and progression of KC17
immunophenotypes during the course of the inflammation in AD.
To identify sub-populations of keratinocytes showing a molecular response to a
specific inflammatory cytokine, we further trained the algorithm to resolve
keratinocytes responding to IFN-α and IFN-γ (KC1), IL-4 and IL-13 (KC2), IL-17A

(KC17), KGF, IL-26, IL-22, TNF, IL-1b, as well as resting (Figure 3b-e,
Supplementary figure S1). These were tracked across 14 healthy (HH), 18 AD nonlesional samples (AD-Non), seven AD acute lesional samples (AD-AcL) and 18 AD
chronic lesional samples (AD-ChL) (GSE32924 and GSE36842) and 14 psoriasis
non-lesional samples (Ps-Non) and 14 in psoriasis lesional (Ps-Les) to investigate
disease-related shift in the transcriptomic programme of these cells (Figure 3b-e).
As expected, in AD, a strong KC2 signal was clearly detectable, showing that
keratinocytes in chronic lesions were significantly responding to type 2 cytokines in
comparison to healthy skin (ANOVA, p<0.05) (Figure 3c). Interestingly, this signal
was equally strong in non-lesional skin suggesting that this dysregulation may be
systemic in AD.

A keratinocyte interferon programme, KC1, was prominent in lesional and absent
from non-lesional psoriatic samples (ANOVA, p<0.0001) (Figure 3b). KC1 was also
found in chronic lesions from AD samples, showing a trend of increase from nonlesional and acute lesional stages (Figure 3b), inferring the complex Th2/Th17/Th1
inflammation experienced by the epidermis of chronic AD lesions also alters the
transcriptomic programme of keratinocytes. As expected, the KC17 signal was
significantly elevated in psoriatic lesions compared to heathy controls and paired
non-lesion samples (ANOVA, p<0.0001) (Figure 3d). In contrast to AD, the Th17
signal was absent in both non-lesional psoriatic skin and skin of healthy controls.
Compared to healthy controls, AD keratinocytes showed an IL-17 sensing signal in
lesional as well as non-lesional skin, but this was only significant for chronic lesions
(ANOVA p<0.0001) (Figure 3d). KC17 appeared to dominate in chronic AD lesions,
suggesting an evolution in Th17 pathway over time.

Treatment specific modification of keratinocyte immunophenotype signature.
Microarray data from psoriasis patients treated with etanercept, showed longitudinal
abrogation of KC17 (p<0.0001) underscoring the role of this pathway in psoriasis
pathogenesis (Figure 4b). The immunophenotypic signature of response to AD
treatment was more nuanced. Despite efficacy and improvement in disease severity
scores across the cohort (SCORAD50 improvement), ciclosporin treatment did not
reduce the KC2 fraction in either non-lesional or lesional samples (Figure 4c).
However, the KC17 fraction in lesional keratinocytes was significantly reduced by
ciclosporin (p=0.02) which evolved to show no significant difference from nonlesional skin (p>0.05) (Figure 4d).

To follow the effect of anti-Th2 treatment on keratinocyte transcriptomic responses,
we used the GEO microarray dataset GSE130588, where bulk skin microarray data
was obtained from AD patients treated with 400mg of dupilumab with biopsies taken
at treatment initiation, 4-weeks and 16-weeks on the conclusion of treatment, along
with a cohort healthy control. Biopsies were taken from the same lesional site and
showed a clinical and transcriptomic improvement in clinical atopy with treatment in
established, ongoing lesions. Interestingly, very few of the AD samples, including
many of the lesional biopsies, showed a KC17 fraction. Dupilumab treatment
demonstrated a dramatic early reduction in the KC2 fraction of lesions at 4 weeks
compared to baseline (p=0.0007), which was sustained at 16 weeks (p=0.0002)
(Figure 4e). At the start of treatment, AD lesions had an increased KC2 profile
compared to healthy controls, which resolved to be comparable by the end of anti-IL4/IL-13 treatment.

Discussion
Despite our understanding of the role of inflammatory cells in AD, and identification
of the different inflammatory signals evident in AD, it is surprising that little attention
has been paid to characterising the keratinocyte response in detail. This has
perhaps, in part, been due to technical challenges associated with addressing the
question. Standard approaches to bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic studies of
AD4 employ statistical tools to identify differentially expressed genes in lesions
versus non-lesions and can utilise gene set enrichment analysis based on the
functional annotation of the differentially expressed transcripts to identify cellular
processes which are more or less prominent in AD.

However, such a macro view of the AD transcriptome prevents characterisation of
individual responses of the various cell-types comprising skin. Widely used
approaches to look at individual cell populations include flow cytometry and
immunohistochemistry. Despite the routine application of these methodologies, and
valuable insights they can provide for a relatively narrow set of markers, they only
inform analysis of cell phenotype in a relatively limited way, partly because both of
these techniques require a monoclonal antibody label of which a limited panel can be
applied to a single sample. Single cell sequencing from whole skin or from flow
sorted populations would allow the investigator to undertake detailed
characterisation of cell types in AD in a non-hypothesis driven manner. However, as
yet, these approaches are limited by cost, and the relatively low number of
sequenced cells as a proportion of the whole tissue sample may present a sampling
bias. We sought to address cellular analysis within tissue by a different approach.
Using machine learning on published datasets, we trained an algorithm to identify

different skin cell types and then cellular responses to different inflammatory
responses of interest. We validated this algorithm on transcriptomic studies of
microdissected healthy skin and psoriasis which has a known immune pathway
dependence, showing that our approach is a powerful method for investigating
transcriptomic signatures in skin samples of complex disease.

Applying such optimised machine learning-based analysis to existing datasets of AD
disease stages and during treatment has confirmed the constitutive atopic skin
phenotype in AD patients. An altered transcriptomic programme in keratinocytes was
evident in all samples (lesional and non-lesional) which reflected Th2 sensing by
keratinocytes which we termed “KC2”, and similar findings have been reported by
others3,5. Further, we show the immunophenotype shift characteristic of lesion
progression modifies keratinocyte profiles to an IL-17 (KC17) and interferon (KC1)
sensing phenotype. Thus, we could demonstrate that although acute AD lesions
show a strong Th2 signal, and chronic lesions have Th1 and Th17 signals, the Th2related processes is amplified rather than a switch away from a type 2 cytokine
response in chronic lesions.

Effective treatment of psoriasis with ciclosporin showed a reversal of the dominant
KC17 profile of lesional skin to that of unaffected skin. However, in AD, remarkably,
and despite resolution of skin inflammation as measured by disease severity,
ciclosporin did not modify the KC2 profile of lesional skin. Instead, AD disease
remission with ciclosporin correlated with loss of the KC17 signal. In contrast to this,
with dupilumab, striking loss of the KC2 signal associated with disease remission,
whereas the KC17 response was not observed. This underscores the critical role of

the type 2 cytokines in AD and might suggest a strong role for IL-17 pathway in AD
pathogenesis; it may also reflect the complex immunophenotype of the disease and
potential immune mediator redundancy.

Our analysis to computationally resolve keratinocyte sub-populations by their
sensing of immune-related signals does not address AD as a disease driven by
epidermal disruption or systemic immune abnormalities. Indeed, we see evidence of
some individual variation at a keratinocyte level, particularly of KC2 and KC17
immunophenotypes. We postulate that various environmental factors such as
commensal dysbiosis may contribute to individual variation in epidermal sensing by
keratinocytes and may regulate the epidermal response, both modifying and
modified by immune infiltrate signals. This theory would suggest that perturbation of
the immune signal alone may, in some situations, be insufficient to resolve the
keratinocyte immunophenotype. Furthermore, such considerations emphasise the
importance of characterising the epidermal responses alongside the immune signals
in molecular studies of AD.

In summary, in-silico deconvolution of the transcriptional phenotype of AD
keratinocytes has revealed two levels of pathology. First, individuals with AD
epidermis demonstrate keratinocytes sensing of type 2 cytokines. Secondly,
although the IL-4/IL-13 signal becomes enhanced in chronic AD lesions, it appears
that induction of an IL-17 response acts as a key switch between acute/chronic AD.
This confirms the model of sequential activation of helper T-cell responses across
the development and chronicity of cutaneous lesions. Finally, we showed that
despite disease resolution with both ciclosporin and dupilumab, ciclosporin treatment

rebalances KC17 subpopulation comparable to normal skin but does not modify type
2 cytokine sensing. Whereas, dupilumab therapy reverses the KC2 dominance in
lesional AD. Taken together, these observations suggest that whilst type 2 cytokines
appear to drive the biology of AD, the efficacy of ciclosporin in AD is likely to lie
beyond the targeting of T cells with resultant Th17 inhibition and that other pathways
modified by this effective therapy should be explored as potential therapeutic targets.
