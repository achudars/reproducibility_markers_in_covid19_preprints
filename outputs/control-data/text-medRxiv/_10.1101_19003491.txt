Abstract
Background
Previous research has suggested that stress may have a negative effect on the clinical
performance of paramedics. In addition, stress has been demonstrated to have a negative
impact the driving abilities of the general population, increasing the number of driving errors.
However, to date no studies have explored stress and its potential impact on non-clinical
performance of paramedics, particularly their driving abilities.

Methods
Paramedic students underwent emergency driving assessment in a driving simulator before
and after exposure to a stressful medical scenario. Number and type of errors were
documented before and after by both driving simulator software and observation by two
observers from the research team. The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was utilised to record
self-reported stress levels.
Results
36 students participated in the study. Following exposure to a stressful medical scenario,
paramedic students demonstrated no increase in overall error rate, but demonstrated an
increase in three critical driving errors, namely failure to wear a seatbelt (3 baseline v 10 post
stress), failing to stop for red lights or stop signs (7 v 35), and losing control of the vehicle (2
v 11). Self-reported stress levels also increased after the clinical scenario, particularly in the
area of mental (cognitive) demand.
Conclusion
Paramedics are routinely exposed to acute stress in their everyday work, and this stress could
affect their non-clinical performance. The critical errors committed by participants in this
study closely matched those considered to be contributory factors in many ambulance
collisions. These results stimulate the need for further research into the effects of stress on
non-clinical performance in general, and highlight the potential need to consider additional
driver training and stress management education in order to mitigate the frequency and
severity of driving errors.
Key points
• Paramedics are exposed to stressful clinical scenarios during the course of their work
• Many critical and serious clinical calls require transport to hospital
• Ambulance crashes occur regularly and pose a significant risk to the safety and
wellbeing of both patients and paramedics
• This simulated clinical scenario followed by a simulated driving scenario has
highlighted that stress appears to affect driving abilities in paramedic students
• The findings of this study, although conducted in paramedic students in simulated
environments, highlight the need to further investigate the effects of stress on driving
abilities among paramedics

Introduction
Paramedic practice is enacted in inherently stressful environments and contexts. Sources of
such stress include high acuity patients that decompensate quickly, performance of highintensity procedures, a lack of personal time, and a disruption of social support (LeBlanc,
2009). Paramedics are regularly subjected to emotionally challenging work (Williams),
violence (Bigham et al., 2014; Boyle and Wallis, 2016) occupational injury (Maguire et al.,
2014), poor physical health status (MacQuarrie et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2019), and the effects
of shift-work (Patterson et al., 2012). In addition, operational experiences such as attending
hoax calls, missing meal breaks, and interacting with the public appear to influence
psychological health, anxiety and stress in paramedics (Brough, 2004)
The literature on stress and performance is ambiguous and conflicting; some studies
demonstrate no impact or even improvement of task performance, while other studies have
demonstrated a negative impact on performance while stressed. For example, some research
concludes that stress responses are associated with impairments in memory, attention, and
decision-making abilities (Eysenck et al., 1987; Lieberman et al., 2002) while there is
conflicting evidence that illustrates decision-making and memory in emergency workers are
unaffected by stress (LeBlanc and Bandiera, 2007; Regehr et al., 2008). A number of
previous studies demonstrated decreased performance on complex cognitive tasks,
deterioration in communication skills, increased errors in medication calculations, and an
increase in documentation errors among paramedics when stressed (LeBlanc et al., 2012,
2005). These results suggest that cognition and memory in paramedics could be affected by
acute stress.
Research also illustrates that more experienced paramedics (the population in most of these
studies) are not unaffected by stress but likely have developed more effective coping
strategies to deal with stress (LeBlanc et al., 2012, 2005). This suggests that less experienced
paramedics, including paramedic students and recent graduates, may be more susceptible to
impaired performance when stressed than their more experienced counterparts, as they have
not yet developed these coping strategies. In light of the potential relationship between stress
and clinical performance, it is surprising that relatively little remains known about the effects
that stress has on the non-clinical performance of paramedics. If stress does in fact impair
other aspects of non-clinical performance, it could result in significant consequences for
patient care, patient safety, and provider safety.
One of the core non-clinical aspects of the paramedic role is the driving component of
traditional emergency ambulance work. Studies in the general public have demonstrated an
association between stress and impaired driving, resulting in collisions (Rowden et al., 2011).
Factors including adverse road conditions, other drivers, personality type, time constraints,
and occupational stress have previously been linked to an increase in critical driving errors in
the general public (Cartwright et al., 1996). Stressors in other domains of life such as work
stress, daily hassles, and mental health issues can also adversely affect driving errors,
concentration, and traffic violations (Rowden et al., 2011). Therefore, it is not unreasonable
to assume that similar stressors may affect experienced drivers such as paramedics, and
indeed it would be presumptuous to declare that paramedic driving ability is not affected by
stress in the absence of any evidence. However, there is some evidence to suggest that
paramedics possess higher awareness of driving threats when compared to members of the
public, which may mitigate some of these effects (Pammer et al., 2018). Despite this
suggestion, there remains an absence of research into the effects that stress may have on the
driving performance of paramedics. For example, the majority of ambulance collisions occur

while driving under emergency driving conditions with lights and sirens on during emergency
calls (Murray and Kue, 2017; Watanabe et al., 2019) - a source of stress response in
paramedic practice. It however remains unclear whether such collisions are the fault of the
driver of the ambulance, or drivers of other vehicles (Kahn et al., 2001; Saunders, 1994).
Given our lack of understanding of these collisions, and their potential implications for
patient and paramedic safety we posit the potential causes of these collisions warrant further
investigation.
However we face a challenge when we attempt to report statistics related to ambulance
collisions. The data are elusive, and are highly dependent on the definition of “collision” used
by each agency (which itself often remains unclear or unreported). Although this may seem
trivial, it prevents researchers, policy-makers and end-users from adequately understanding
the importance of the issue. The USA appears to have addressed some of these barriers
through the development of a national reporting database. This database reported an annual
average of 4,500 collisions that involved an ambulance, which resulted in an average of 33
fatalities and 2,600 injuries annually. Almost 60% of these collisions occurred during the
course of emergency driving (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2011a,
2011b; Smith, 2015). Figures for Canada remain largely unknown, with Alberta emergency
vehicles involved in approximately 300 collisions per annum (Yasmin et al., 2014), and B.C
vehicles involved in approximately 400 per annum (Tyakoff et al., 2014). UK figures present
a similar challenge to locate; however, a search of grey literature indicated that the Welsh
Ambulance Service experienced 735 emergency vehicle crashes between 2011 and 2016, and
150 occurred during emergency calls (BBC, 2011). Between 2009 and 2014, 148 ambulance
collisions occurred in Berkshire, 310 in Hampshire, and 240 across Oxfordshire and
Buckinghamshire (BBC, 2014) while 81 ambulances in the West Midlands crashed between
2012 and 2014 (Lumb, 2015). Even in light of the difficulty obtaining such data, the volume
of events that occur across these jurisdictions suggest there is an onus on the community to
investigate potential contributory factors involved in these collisions, and take steps to
mitigate their impact.
It is important to clarify that we do not seek to claim stress as the sole, or even the most
important, contributory factor that may affect the non-clinical performance of paramedics. A
myriad of factors including fatigue, health status, and burnout may all influence paramedic
performance (MacQuarrie et al., 2018; Ramey et al., 2019; Sofianopoulos et al., 2011). In
fact, research demonstrates that acute stress is related to other health symptoms, such as
fatigue, burnout, and post-traumatic symptoms (van der Ploeg, 2003) which further supports
the need to investigate the potential impact of acute stress on performance. Therefore, the role
of acute stress during the emergency driving phase of paramedic practice, before and after a
stressful call, is the focus of our study. We aimed to examine the effects of acute stress on the
number of critical driving errors made by paramedic students, and we hypothesized that they
would demonstrate an increase in critical driving errors after the completion of a stress
inducing clinical scenario.
Methods and materials
Participants
Participants were recruited from a convenience sample of first and second year paramedic
students at [redacted for peer review], Ontario, Canada. All participants had a minimum of a
valid G class licence (car licence) and knowledge of the Ontario Traffic Act and Ambulance
Act. Participants were excluded from this study if they did not meet the above criteria.

Ethics and consent
Ethical approval was received from [redacted for peer review] Research Ethics Board
(protocol S 17-10-02-1). Participation was voluntary and all data were anonymized
immediately following the simulation to maintain confidentiality. Participants were informed
that they could withdraw their consent at any stage of the process prior to anonymization.
Setting
This study was conducted in the province of Ontario, Canada. Paramedics in Ontario are
generally staffed two per ambulance or solo response on a response vehicle. When they are
double-crewed, they share both driving and patient care duties. The Highway Traffic Act
(HTA) in Ontario governs the operation of motor vehicles on public roads, and provides for
four primary exemptions (although there are more) for drivers of emergency vehicles:
1. Emergency vehicle drivers can proceed through a red light, after making a full stop
and ensuring all traffic has stopped for them.
2. Emergency vehicle drivers are allowed to pass a streetcar on the left, because
streetcars cannot pull over to the right.
3. Fire trucks are permitted to drive in the far left lane of the Don Valley Parkway,
Gardiner Expressway and the 400 Series Highways
4. Emergency vehicle drivers can exceed the speed limit, as long as the lights and siren
are activated (for ambulances: while responding to an emergency call or being used to
transport a patient or injured person in an emergency situation).
(Ontario Ministry of Transport, 1990)
In order for these exemptions to be utilised, the vehicle must have flashing red/white/blue
lights and siren activated simultaneously, and it must be a true emergency. Emergency
vehicle drivers must operate the emergency vehicle with due regard for the safety of others,
on and off the road (Krkachovski, 2008). In addition, emergency vehicles are granted certain
additional privileges under the HTA, such as the ability to drive on closed highways, and use
of communication devices. They are not permitted to drive the wrong direction on streets, and
they are not exempted from coming to a complete stop at stop signs before proceeding
through the intersection. Paramedic students receive education related to these privileges and
exemptions.
Materials – driving simulation
The simulated driving scenario was conducted using a PatrolSim ambulance driving
simulator [Version 4, L3 Training Solutions, Salt Lake City, UT] based at [redacted for peer
review]. This is an open-cabin simulator which simulates driving conditions in both
emergency and non-emergency modes, visually and aurally (see Figure 1). It does not have
the ability to simulate motion. While the evidence related to validity of driving simulators is
mixed (Mullen et al., 2011), the use of a driving simulator in this pilot study was designed to
minimize ethical concerns and risks related to the operation of real vehicles by participants,
particularly in the post-stress phase. While driving simulators are a poor choice for the
assessment of real world driving (for example as a substitute to road testing), they are
generally considered a valid tool for researching driving (Mullen et al., 2011). The simulator

provides navigation directions on screen using large arrows which denote route of travel
similar to that of commonly used global positioning system car navigation units. This
simulator is also capable of recording a number of critical driving errors. Participants were
initially provided with an orientation and test run in the simulator prior to any data collection
(driving or clinical scenario) in order to provide them with the opportunity to understand the
simulator functions. Participants were then given a brief overview of the HTA and
Ambulance Act to ensure that all participants understood the rules of the road. A baseline
driving assessment was then performed whereby each participant drove the simulated
ambulance under emergency driving conditions from a known starting position to a denoted
endpoint. Pre-programmed, standardised “EMS_City_2” and “EMS_City_3” routes were
used, each consisting of a 2-3 minute drive with a set start and end location. These routes are
artificial simulated driving routes, and do not represent or mimic a ‘real world’ driving route
that students would be familiar with. The “baseline” drive and “post-stress” drive were
standardized for each participant.

Figure 1. PatrolSim ambulance driving simulator [Version 4, L3 Training Solutions, Salt
Lake City, UT]
Data were collected using two complementary approaches. First, a computer generated log of
driving errors was captured by the PatrolSim software. These errors included: failure to wear
a seatbelt (not exempted under HTA); exceeding the posted speed limit (exempted with
conditions under the HTA); and collisions. Second, critical errors not recognized by the
driving simulator were recorded by the researchers, and included: failure to stop at a stop sign
(controlled intersection; NOT exempted under HTA), running a red light (controlled
intersection; exempted with conditions under HTA), and loss of vehicle control. We defined
loss of control of the vehicle as “the act of the driver being unable to successfully maneuver
the vehicle, resulting in the simulated vehicle skidding off the road surface and requiring the
vehicle to come to a stop to regain control”.

Materials – stress inventory
Once the participants had completed each drive, they completed a self-reported stressinventory test on a supplied tablet device. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) is a widely used instrument to assess overall
subjective workload, and has previously demonstrated accurate test-retest reliability, validity
and sensitivity (Hoonakker et al., 2011), as well as being easy to administer and analyse via
an official NASA developed mobile app. The NASA-TLX is a multidimensional instrument
comprised of six subscales designed to measure workload; mental demand, physical demand,
temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration (Hart and Staveland, 1988). The
NASA-TLX requires participants to weigh and rate these categories on a sliding scale, on a
20-point scale ranging from “Low” to “High”, resulting in a report of the overall workload
burden experienced by the participant on a scale from 0 to 100. The participants repeated the
NASA-TLX after each drive in the simulator to compare their perceived workload burden
between drives.
Materials - clinical simulation
Participants individually completed a 12-minute, stressful clinical simulation which involved
the resuscitation of a paediatric patient. Paramedics have previously reported increased stress
and anxiety when caring for paediatric patients, and they themselves perceive this to be an
important contributor to patient safety events (Guise et al., 2017). This scenario was reviewed
by faculty members to ensure clinical accuracy and to predict its ability to induce stress in
paramedic students. All participants completed the same scenario. Immediately following the
scenario, the individual was required to drive the simulator under emergency driving
conditions from another standardised start to end point. They were also required to complete
the NASA-TLX for a second time. Participants were then given the opportunity to debrief
after their participation to address any concerns, and were informed of additional support
services.
Data Analysis
“Baseline” and “post-stress” driving errors were compared using results from the driving
simulator’s computer-generated report of critical errors as well as critical driving errors
recorded by two observers. “Baseline” and “post-stress” perceived levels of stress were
compared using results from the NASA-TLX. Descriptive statistics are used to illustrate data.
We now report on critical driving errors that occurred under emergency driving conditions,
namely failure to wear a seatbelt, failure to stop (red light or stop sign at a controlled
intersection), and loss of control of vehicle.
Results
A total of 36 participants completed the study with 29 first year students (81%) and 7 second
year (19%). Critical driving errors occurred more often “post-stress” than at baseline. Failure
to wear a seatbelt, failure to stop for red lights or stop signs, and loss of control of the vehicle
all demonstrated an increase after exposure to stress compared to “baseline” (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Critical driving errors at baseline and post-stress.
Participants reported an increased level of stress during the “post-stress” drive (overall
weighted stress score of 67.59/100) compared to “baseline” drive (overall weighted stress
score of 63.81/100) via the NASA-TLX (Figure 2). When stress scores were broken down
into specific categories, it was found that on average participants rated “mental demand” the
highest source of stress (73.1/100), followed by “frustration” (64.86/100), “effort”
(63.47/100), “temporal (time) demand” (61.39/100), performance demand” (54.58/100), and
finally “physical demand” (26.39/100). No participants reported experiencing simulator
sickness.

Discussion
The results of this pilot study demonstrate that paramedic students make more critical driving
errors when stressed, namely failure to wear a seat belt, failure to stop at stop signs or red
lights (intersections), and loss of control of the vehicle. The types of errors made after stress
exposure suggest that paramedic students may drive in a manner that is less defensive and

more unsafe during transport after stressful calls. Participants also reported higher levels of
stress after a stressful clinical scenario, in particular in the domain of mental (cognitive)
demand. Our findings suggest that acute stress may affect the non-clinical performance of
paramedic students. These findings are important for the community to reflect on (bearing in
mind their limitations), given the potential consequences for both paramedics and patients.
Participants reported increased mental demand on the NASA-TLX during this study. A
possible cause for the rise in the specific critical errors reported in this study may be due to
cognitive overload from the stressful stimuli that were induced. We are all constantly
overloaded with perceptual information in our daily lives and activities. Our ability to process
this volume of information is limited, and under stressful conditions the cognitive system can
become overloaded, decreasing resources devoted to attention, and therefore our ability to
concentrate and perform a specific task (LeBlanc, 2009). This increased mental demand may
potentially contribute to lack of awareness or risky decision making leading to critical errors
when operating an ambulance under emergency driving conditions.
The particular critical errors demonstrated by participants in this study were interesting to
note in that they appear related to driving while stressed under emergency driving conditions.
This is an interesting observation, as fatal ambulance collisions are more prevalent when the
lights and sirens are activated during emergency driving (Kahn et al., 2001). For example, we
discovered that participants were 3.3 times less likely to wear their seatbelt when driving
“post-stress”. Failure to wear a seatbelt while driving is inherently dangerous, and results in
significantly higher mortality rates when compared to collisions where seatbelts were worn
(Abbas et al., 2011). Unfortunately multiple examples can be identified via media reports of
paramedics and patients who have been seriously injured or killed due to lack of restraint in a
collision. Participants also demonstrated an increase (post-stress) in failure to stop at stop
signs or red lights (controlled intersections) before exercising exemption (applicable to red
lights) and proceeding through them under emergency driving conditions. Failure to stop is
one of the leading causes of ambulance collisions in the USA (Retting et al., 2003). Injuries
and fatalities are more likely in collisions involving missed stop signs or red lights than in
other crash types (Retting et al., 2003; Yasmin et al., 2014). In addition, most fatal ambulance
crashes in the USA occur while going through an intersection with the emergency lighting
and sirens activated (Kahn et al., 2001). Our findings, combined with the evidence from the
literature, suggests that activation of lights and sirens alone may be insufficient measures to
prevent collisions at controlled intersections. Reinforcing existing advice that emergency
vehicle operators come to a complete stop at stop signs and red lights under emergency
driving conditions before proceeding appears appropriate in order to reduce these types of
collisions (Krkachovski, 2008).
Given the occupational stress and time constraints regularly encountered by paramedics
(LeBlanc et al., 2012), and in light of our findings, we suggest that the link between stress
and non-clinical performance is worthy of further exploration. Specifically to driving
performance, existing guidance related to driving under emergency conditions may need to
be revisited or clarified. Even 20 years ago, Whiting et al. suggested that those with less
experience and perhaps education could benefit from additional training in an attempt to
reduce the number of ambulance collisions (Whiting et al., 1998). For example, the provision
of advanced driver training may mitigate some of these forms of collisions through earlier
recognition and anticipation of potential issues, leading to “expert drivers” (Pammer et al.,
2018). Given the potential negative impact of stress on performance educators might also
consider avenues for training learners in stress management (LeBlanc, 2009).

Finally, although not a direct outcome of our study, our preliminary work focused on
gathering data and identifying literature to support and inform our study. Efforts to source
these data presented challenges, which we have discussed elsewhere (redacted for peerreview). In particular, the lack of easily accessible statistics on the incidence of emergency
vehicle and ambulance collisions presented a challenge. This is caused by a lack of national
reporting databases, and makes it difficult for researchers and policymakers to base
recommendations on appropriate evidence. It also results in an observable lack of
standardization; the definition of ‘collision’ for example was often ambiguous, undefined or
conflicted with a definition used elsewhere. This lack of standardization poses a challenge
when attempts are made to quantify the scale and impact of the issue. Future endeavours to
implement national or regional standardized reporting measures should seek to resolve this
obstacle.
Limitations
Our small sample size means our results were prone to error in statistical analysis, and thus
we elected to discuss our results in terms of descriptive statistics only. The results may not
accurately reflect driving abilities of all paramedic students in the program, and this reduces
the external validity of the results. However, the findings of this pilot study are designed to
stimulate discussion and provide a foundation for future, more robust research on the issue. In
addition, the majority of participants were first year paramedic students with limited
ambulance operations experience. Although the driving simulator is able to recreate the
visual and auditory aspects of driving quite accurately, it is unable to recreate the physical
forces (g-forces) and sensations of acceleration, deceleration, and turning. Participants
reported this made it difficult to judge their speed, how hard they were braking, and how
aggressively they were steering in the simulator. Therefore, our results cannot be directly
translated to the driving of real vehicles; however, the underlying suggestion that stress
appears to affect driving (non-clinical) performance is worthy of further investigation, and to
date has not been well investigated in paramedics. The conduct of this study with real
emergency vehicles would be fraught with issues surrounding ethical conduct and participant
safety. On the other hand, future studies in this area would benefit from studying a larger
population of clinically active paramedics through ethically appropriate means, as well as
paramedic students and recent graduates. These future studies may yield results that are more
applicable to the population who are affected by the issues highlighted in our results. Future
research could also consider objective physiological markers of stress in addition to
subjective self-reported stress approaches.
Conclusion
Paramedics are subjected to stressful situations on a regular basis in their careers, which may
affect both their clinical and non-clinical performance. One of the main non-clinical roles in
emergency paramedic work is the driving of ambulances under non-emergency and
emergency driving conditions. Our results demonstrate that paramedic students reported
higher levels of stress after a stressful simulated clinical scenario. In a simulated driving
environment they demonstrated an increase in critical driving errors after a stressful
simulated clinical scenario. These critical errors represent potential contributory factors in
ambulance collisions, namely failure to stop, failure to wear a seatbelt, and loss of control of
the vehicle. The findings of this study should stimulate increased dialogue on the effects of
acute stress on paramedic performance, its potential implications for both paramedics and
patients, and further research into the effects of stress on driving ability and other non-clinical
aspects of the paramedic role.
