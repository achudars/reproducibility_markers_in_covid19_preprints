Abstract
Background: Diagnosing MS through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires extensive
clinical experience and tedious work. Furthermore, MRI-indicated MS lesion locations rarely align
with the patients’ symptoms and often contradict with pathology studies. Our lab has developed
and modified a novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technique to address the
shortcomings of MRI-based MS diagnoses. Although primary DBSI metrics have been
demonstrated to be associated with axonal injury/loss, demyelination and inflammation, a more
detailed analysis using multiple DBSI-structural metrics to improve the accuracy of MS lesion
detection and differentiation is still needed. Here we report that Diffusion Histology Imaging
(DHI), an improved approach that combines a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm with
improved DBSI analyses, accurately detected and classified various MS lesion types.
Methods: Thirty-eight multiple sclerosis patients were scanned with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI)
using fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) using
magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE), magnetization transfer
contrast (MTR) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. The imaging results identified 43,261
voxels from 91 persistent black hole (PBH) lesions, 89 persistent gray hole (PGH) lesions, 16 acute
gray hole (AGH) lesions, 189 non-black hole (NBH) lesions and 113 normal-appearing white
matter (NAWM) areas. Data extracted from these lesions were randomly split into training,
validation, and testing groups with an 8:1:1 ratio. The DNN was constructed with 10 fullyconnected hidden layers using TensorFlow 2.0 in Python. Batch normalization and dropout
regularization were used for model optimization.
Results: Each MS lesion type had unique DBSI derived diffusion metric profiles. Based on these
DBSI diffusion metric profiles, DHI achieved a 93.6% overall concordance with neurologist

determinations of all five MS lesions, compared with 74.3% from conventional MRI (cMRI)-DNN
model, 78.2% from MTR-DNN model, and 80% from DTI-DNN model. DHI also achieved greater
performances on detecting individual MS lesion types compared to other models. Specifically,
DHI showed great performances on prediction of PBH (AUC: 0.991; F1-score: 0.923), PGH (AUC:
0.977; F1-score: 0.823) and AGH (AUC: 0.987; F1-score: 0.887), which significantly outperformed
other models.
Conclusions: DHI significantly improves the detection and classification accuracy for various MS
lesion types, which could greatly aid the clinical decisions of neurologists and neuroradiologists.
The efficacy and efficiency of this DNN model shows great promise for clinical application.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common inflammatory CNS disorder that affects around 900,000
people in the United States1. MS usually begins with patients having intermittent “attacks” (i.e.
relapsing-remitting course) characterized by transient symptoms of focal central nervous system
(CNS) dysfunction, such as numbness or weakness of a limb, incoordination, vertigo or visual
dysfunction2. These clinical attacks, or relapses, are caused by focal inflammation in the CNS
directed against the myelin insulation around the axons3. The inflammation results in focal “MS
lesions” characterized by demyelination, axonal injury and axonal conduction blockage - all
hallmarks of MS3.
Identifying and segmenting the focal white matter (WM) lesions is the first essential step
in characterizing the disease burden of an MS patient, especially in calculating and interpreting
more specific measures of damage. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is often
used to characterize and quantify MS lesions in the brain4, where the lesions are classified based
on their intensity under different MR sequences5. The classical appearance of WM lesions in cMRI
manifests as hyperintense regions in T2-weighted images (T2WI) and hypointense region in T1weighted images (T1WI)5.
While standard cMRI is sensitive in detecting various MS lesions, it lacks pathological
specificity and requires extensive clinical experience and large workload6. Accurate identification
of MS lesions using cMRI becomes extremely difficult due to lesion variability in location, size
and shape; the anatomical variability between subject further complicates diagnoses7. In addition,
the association of MS lesions with clinical presentation and pathologies may come in discordance.

Our lab has developed a novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI)8,9 and
demonstrated its capability in quantitatively characterizing the pathologies that underlay MRI
lesions in MS patients and post-mortem specimens10,11. Despite DBSI metrics have been validated
to be specifically associated with axonal injury/loss, demyelination and inflammation, the validity
and accuracy of applying DBSI in detecting and differentiating MS lesion based on the multiple
DBSI-structural metrics have yet to be established. Therefore, we introduced a novel Diffusion
Histology Imaging (DHI) approach that combines a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm with
improved DBSI analysis and reported its accuracy in detecting and classifying the various MS
lesion types.

Materials and Methods
Subject
A total of thirty-eight patients with MS were enrolled in this study. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Washington University School of Medicine. Each participant had
provided written informed consent.

Image Acquisition
Patients were imaged on a 3.0T Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). T1WI using
magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) scan with an isotropic 1 mm3 resolution
was used for identification of structural landmarks and as a registration target (TR=2400 ms,
TE=3.16 ms, TI=1000 ms, Matrix=256×224, FOV=256×224 mm2 Resolution=1×1×1 mm3).
T2WI using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scan was acquired to quantify visible
WM lesion volumes (TR=7500 ms, TI=2500 ms, TE=210 ms, TI=2500 ms, Matrix=256×256,
FOV= 256×256 mm2, Resolution=1×1×1 mm3). Magnetization transfer (MT) images were
acquired with the following parameters: Repetition Time (TR)=43ms; Echo Time (TE)=11 ms;
Flip Angle=30 degrees; Field of View (FOV)=192×256 mm2; slice thickness=3 mm; in-plane
resolution=1×1 mm3; the number of slices=60; total acquisition time=8 min. Magnetization
transfer ratio (MTR) maps were calculated pixel-by-pixel using the equation: MTR= (Soff–Son)/Soff
×100, where Son and Soff were signal intensities with and without saturation pulse. Axial diffusionweighted images (DWI) covering the whole brain were acquired using a multi-b value diffusion
weighting scheme (99 directions, maximum b-value 1500 s/mm2) and the following parameters:
TR=10,000 ms; TE=120 ms; FOV=256×256 mm2; slice thickness=2 mm; in-plane resolution=2×2
mm3; number of slices=56; total acquisition time=15 min. Eddy current and motion artifacts of
DWI were corrected, then the susceptibility-induced off-resonance field was estimated and
corrected.

MS Lesion Identification
All the lesions were identified by an experienced neurologist with 20 years of clinical experience.
Amira 6.0.1 visualization and analysis software (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) was used to quantify intensity
values for each hypointense lesion on all scans. Hypointense areas of white matter (WM) on T1WI
were defined as “black holes” (BH). Less hypointense BHs were defined as “gray holes” (GH).
Note that the lesion intensity assessment requires establishing the baseline intensity of each scan
to account for scan-to-scan variations.
The BH and GH that have persisted for at least 12 months are markers of focal tissue injury
in MS and are known as “persistent black holes” (PBH) and “persistent gray holes” (PGH),
respectively12. BHs and GHs that have persisted for less than 12 months are markers for
inflammation and are known as “acute black holes” (ABH) and “acute gray holes” (AGH),
respectively. Other T2WI hyperintense non-black/gray hole lesions were defined as non-black hole
(NBH) T2W lesions. ABH were excluded in this study because the number of identified ABHs
were insufficient for model training.
Persistent black holes (PBH, Fig. 1A), persistent gray hole (PGH, Fig. 1B), acute gray hole
(AGH, Fig. 1C), T2-weighted hyperintense non-black hole lesion (NBH, Fig 1D) and normal
appearing white matter regions (NAWM) were identified with corresponding lesion masks drawn
using Amira.

Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging
DBSI metric maps were estimated on pre-processed DW images using an in-house software
developed using MATLAB® (Mathwork, MA). DBSI models the diffusion-weighted MRI signals
as a linear combination of multiple tensors describing both the discrete anisotropic axonal fibers

In [1], Sk and 1 2 are the normalized signal and b-value of the kth diffusion gradient, NAniso is the
number of anisotropic tensors, 3 measures the angle between the kth diffusion gradient and the
principal direction of the ith anisotropic tensor, 4∥ and 45 are the axial diffusivity (AD) and radial
diffusivity (RD) of the ith anisotropic tensor, fi is the signal intensity fraction for the ith anisotropic
tensor, and a and b are the low and high diffusivity limits for the isotropic diffusion spectrum f(D).
The anisotropic diffusion component describes water molecules inside and outside myelinated or
non-myelinated axons. DBSI-derived anisotropic signal intensity fractions (fi, i.e., fiber fraction)
can also be defined as apparent axonal density in WM. DBSI-derived AD and RD retain the
pathological specificity for axonal injury and demyelination as previously proposed models but
contain fewer confounds from coexisting MS pathologies. The DBSI-derived “restricted” isotropic
diffusion fraction (ADC ≤ 0.3 µm2/ms) has been shown to reflect cellularity9. Cellular and axonal
packing plays a crucial role in extracellular and extra-axonal diffusion characteristics. Less
restricted or non-restricted isotropic diffusion components represent water molecules in less
densely packed environments, such as areas of tissue disintegration or edema, or non-restricted
water within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 9,13,14.

Image Processing

Whole-brain voxel-wise DTI and DBSI analyses were performed by an in-house software
developed using MATLAB®. To control for scan-to-scan variation within individual scans,
cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which is unaffected by MS pathologies, was used as the baseline for
individual scans and to asses signal intensities of MS lesions under T1WI and T2WI modalities.
Around one hundred representative CSF voxels in the center of the ventricle were selected to
ensure the exclusion of any voxels containing choroid plexus or partial volume effect from the
ventricular edges. The median intensity was defined as “CSF Intensity” for that scan. For each
voxel in MS lesions, the voxel intensity was divided by the CSF intensity to normalize b0, T1WI,
and T2WI intensities.

DNN Model Development and Optimization
Our complete data sample consisted of 43261 imaging voxels from 499 MS lesions coming from
38 patients. The collected voxels were split into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio
of 8:1:1 respectively. We compared four different models, each containing their own set of features.
The first model is the DBSI-DNN model (DHI), which used DBSI metrics, normalized T1WI and
T2WI intensities; the second model is the conventional MRI (cMRI) DNN model, which used
normalized T1WI and T2WI intensities; the third model is the MTR CNN model, which used MTR
metrics and normalized T1WI and T2WI intensities; finally, the fourth model is the DTI DNN
model, which used DTI metrics and normalized T1WI and T2WI intensities. A total of 16 diffusion
metrics from DBSI and 4 DTI metrics were used.
The DNN model was developed using Tensorflow 2.0 frameworks15 in Python. DNN
models with varying numbers of hidden layers, nodes and training epochs were tested for model
optimization. The grid search method was used for the network architecture optimization. Pruning

was also adopted to optimize the number of nodes per layer in DNN models. The neural networks
were pruned to having between 0 and 200 nodes in each layer in increments of 10 nodes. Pruned
neural networks were tested against validation accuracy over 150 epochs. Ten sets of 10-fold crossvalidation were performed at unique random states to ensure the statistical relevance of the results.
Batch normalization was performed with a mini-batch size of 200 before feeding data to the next
hidden layer to improve model optimization and prevent overfitting. Exponential linear units (ELU)
were used to activate specific functions in each hidden layer. The final layer was a fully connected
softmax layer that produces a likelihood distribution over the five output classes. The network was
trained with random initialization of the weights as described in He et al16. The Adam optimizer
was used with the default parameters of β1=0.9 and β2=0.999 and a mini-batch size of 200. The
learning rate was manually tuned to achieve the fastest convergence (1×10−3). The cross-entropy
loss function was chosen, and the model was trained to minimize the error rate on the development
dataset. The hyper-parameters of the network architecture and optimization algorithm were chosen
through a combination of grid search and manual tuning.

Statistical Analysis
Confusion matrices were calculated and used to illustrate the specific examples of MS lesion
classes where the DNN prediction contradicts the neurologist’s diagnoses. The one-versus-rest
strategy was implemented to perform ROC analysis and area under curve (AUC) was calculated
to assess model discrimination of each lesion type. Sensitivity and specificity values were
calculated at the optimal cut off points, which were computed by maximizing the differences
between true positive rates and false positive rates. The precision-recall curve was calculated to
show the relationship between precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity/true

positive rate) which provides complementary information to the ROC curve when using data with
imbalanced classes. F1 scores were computed and used to compare the relative performance of the
DNN models to the neurologist-identified MS lesions. The F1 score favors models that maximize
both precision and recall simultaneously, which is especially helpful in the setting of multi-class
prediction where the AUC may be insensitive class imbalance. All the 95% confidence interval
values were calculated with bootstrap methods with 1000 iterations17. Statistical metrics and
curves were calculated by packages from Scikit-learn18.

Results
MS Patient and Lesion Characteristics
A total of 38 patients were recruited for this study. The male to female ratio of the patients was 12
to 26. The patients averaged 55 years old (±10.6 years). Among these patients, 15 had primary
progressive MS, 10 had secondary progressive MS and 13 had relapsing remitting MS (Table 1).
A neurologist with 20+ years of experience identified regions of interest (ROI), which included 92
PBH lesions, 89 PGH lesions, 16 AGH lesions, 189 NBH lesions and 113 NAWM regions. The
average volumes of the MS lesions were 108.3, 66.5, 141.1, 60.6 and 120.9 mm3, respectively.
Three of the 38 subjects had no PBH or PGH lesions.

Histogram Analysis of Different MRI Metrics
Conventional MRI, DTI and DBSI metrics showed distinguishing distribution profiles among
different MS lesion types (Fig. 2). NAWM regions clearly displayed lower normalized FLAIR
signals than other lesion types. PBH, PGH, AGH and NBH lesions showed similar distributions
with significant overlap. PBH lesions have lower MPRAGE and MTR signals compared to

NAWM regions. PBH lesions and PGH lesions also have broader MTR distributions compared to
NAWM regions. PBH lesions and PGH lesions have significantly elevated ADC signals of broader
distributions compared to NAWM regions, NBH lesions, and AGH lesions. PBH lesions and PGH
lesions have significantly narrower DTI-FA distributions. Both PBH and PGH lesions distributions
are also shifted towards smaller values when compared to NAWM regions, NBH lesions and AGH
lesions. PBH lesions and PGH lesions have slightly narrower fiber fraction distributions compared
to NAWM regions, NBH and AGH lesions. Axial and radial diffusivity signals gradually shift
towards higher values from NAWM regions, NBH, AGH, PGH to PBH lesions, respectively.
While all lesions fall within similar signal isotropic ADC ranges, distinct and complex distribution
patterns specific to each type of the lesion show when the DBSI metrics are considered. PBH and
PGH lesions have lower restricted fraction signals and much narrower distributions compared to
NAWM regions, NBH and AGH lesions. Hindered fraction signals gradually shift towards higher
values from NAWM regions, T2W, AGH, PGH to PBH lesions, respectively. The peak on the left
side of the distribution in NAWM regions becomes smaller with the shift and becomes very small
in PBH lesions. Water fraction distributions were essentially the same for all five lesions types,
showing narrow distributions of small values.
Overall, different MRI metrics show various distribution patterns among different MS
lesion\region types. While some lesion\region types show specific separations, most of the MS
lesion\region distributions overlap significantly under conventional MRI. This makes it difficult
to accurately distinguish different lesion\region types from each other based solely on MRI
features.

DNN model optimization and validation

DNN model optimization were assessed by comparing overall validation accuracies for DHI
model. Neural nets with 9, 10 and 11 hidden layers have smaller standard deviations, while neural
nets with much more or much fewer than ten hidden layers have greater standard deviations,
indicating better reliability of neural nets with 9, 10, and 11 hidden layers (Fig. 3A). Further, we
also assessed models by comparing the number of training epochs and nodes in each hidden layer
required for the neural nets to reach 90% validation accuracy. Neural nets with between 100 and
200 nodes per hidden layer produced the best results, which consistently required less than 60
training epochs to achieve a 90% validation accuracy (Fig. 3B). Neural nets with fewer nodes per
hidden layer required an increasing number of epochs for training to attain 90% validation
accuracy at an exponential rate. In sum, we demonstrated that the neural net with 10 hidden layers
and 100 nodes in each layer produces a model with an increasing function and converges to over
90% with minimal standard deviation by 100 training epochs (Fig. 3C).

Test Performances of Different DNN Models
DHI model achieved a 93.4% overall concordance with neurologist determinations of all five MS
lesions, which outperformed the 78.3% rate from MTR-DNN model, the 80.2% accuracy from
DTI-DNN model and the 74.2% accurate prediction from cMRI-DNN model. We used confusion
matrices to indicate the discordances between model predictions and neurologist-determined
lesion/region types derived from the DHI model (Fig. 4A), the DTI-DNN model (Fig. 4B), the
MTR-DNN model (Fig. 4C), and the cMRI-DNN model (Fig. 4D). For one independent test
dataset (n=4326), DHI detected PBH, PGH, AGH, T2W, and NAWM with positive prediction
rates of 91.3%, 83.4%, 90.1%, 92.3% and 97.9%, respectively, showing very high detection rates.
DTI-DNN performed well in detecting PBH, NBH, and NAWM with true positive rates of
80.1%, 84.8%, and 95.8%, respectively. PGH and AGH were still poorly detected, with a mere

45.7% and 48.1% rates, respectively. DTI-DNN falsely predicted PGH to be PBH (23.9%) or NBH
lesion (28.3%). AGH was also mostly false predicted to be T2W lesion (32.2%) and NAWM
(16.4%). MTR-DNN model detected NAWM well with a 94% rate. PGH detection was only 63.3%
accurate. 17.4% of PGH was incorrectly predicted to be PBH, and another 17.4% of PGH was
incorrectly predicted to be NBH lesion. AGH was poorly detected with only a 35% rate. Large
portion of AGH was falsely precited to be NBH lesion (38.1%) and NAWM (16.4%). CMRI-DNN
model showed good true positive rates on NBH (82.3%) and NAWM (96.1%) lesions. However,
this model didn’t perform well on other lesion types. Specifically, PGH were incorrectly predicted
to be PBH (24.4%) and NBH (37.8%) lesions. The true prediction rate on PGH was only 35.2%.
AGH lesions were also largely incorrectly predicted to be NBH and NAWM with percentages of
55.1% and 38.3%, respectively. The true prediction rate of AGH was only 3.2%.
The one-versus-rest classification strategy was used to calculate ROC and precision-recall
curves to test each DNN model’s detection performance on individual lesion/region type. ROC
(Fig. 5A) and precision-recall (Fig. 5B) curves from each class of the five lesion/region types were
plotted together for comparison. DHI demonstrated the best performances on both ROC and
precision-recall analyses, indicating higher ROC AUC and precision-recall AUC values than any
other model. DTI-DNN, MTR-DNN and cMRI-DNN showed pretty good performances on ROC
analyses, with AUC values for all classes higher than 0.860 (Fig. 5A). However, as ROC analysis
is insensitive to class imbalance, the ROC AUC values could overestimate the model performances.
Precision-recall curve could effectively address this issue and provide complimentary informaton
to ROC. These three models didn’t perform as well on precision-recall analyses. For example, the
precision-recall AUC values for PGH and AGH in these three models were all lower than 0.650
(Fig. 5B). We used bootstrap method with 1000 itertations to calculate ROC AUC, sensitivity and

specificity values for DHI model and summarize the results in Table 2. We also calculated F1score for all the five classes. In particular, we can see the great performance of DHI in detecting
PBH (AUC: 0.991 (95% CI: 0.989-0.994); F1-score: 0.923), PGH (AUC: 0.977 (95% CI: 0.9710.982); F1-score: 0.823) and AGH (AUC: 0.987 (95% CI: 0.980-0.992); F1-score: 0.887).

Discussion
We have developed a novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) and demonstrated its
capability to quantitatively characterize the pathologies underlying MRI lesions in MS patients
and post-mortem specimens. Our main motivation was to examine whether the inclusion of DBSI
metrics in our optimized deep neural network model will increase classification accuracies for
identifying MRI lesions when compared to other established methods. Our results have clearly
demonstrated that the use of DBSI, T1WI and T2WI as neural network inputs produces more
accurate classification results. The confusion matrices indicated that models trained on DBSI
metrics have higher positive prediction rates for each of the five lesion types than the other three
commonly used metric sets for training. The ROC and precision-recall curves clearly show that
the DHI model has greater overall classfication performances for all 5 lesion and tissue types than
the other 3 commonly used metric sets. Furthermore, a wide range of diagnostic performance
metrics show that predictions from the DHI model outshine the other three models trained on
commonly used metric sets.
MRI has played a vital role in the diagnosis and management of MS over the past decades19.
However, conventional T1W and T2W brain imaging techniques do not correlate well with MS
pathologies. One of the main reasons is the complex pathologic heterogeneity of MS lesions20,21.

Furthermore, conventional T1W and T2W imaging contrasts vary from scan to scan and are not
quantitative, as they depend not only on the MR characteristics of brain tissue but also the scanner
vendors, magnet strength, and pulse sequences. Recently, DTI has been widely applied in brain
imaging for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorder22-24, as it has been shown to correlate
with axonal injury and demyelination25-27. However, DTI is based on a single tensor Gaussian
diffusion model, which makes it inadequate in resolving co-existing complicated pathologies such
as neuroinflammation28. To address this issue, DBSI adopts a computationally novel model that
separates isotropic and anisotropic components from each other in imaging voxels 9,29,30. Isotropic
diffusion is believed to reflect inflammatory components (cells, edema), as well as intrinsic cells
and extra-cellular space, while anisotropic components could reflect the integrity of axon fibers
and myelin. DBSI enables the detections and quantifications of these histological components and
associated pathological changes. This has been shown in the EAE mice model and human
specimen, where we demonstrated that the DBSI-derived metrics of axial diffusivity, radial
diffusivity, and restricted isotropic diffusion fraction had significant correlations with
corresponding immunohistochemical stains11,31. DBSI-derived metrics have also been shown to
reflect various specific components of the CNS pathology in patients with MS10,11. These
correlations strongly support the utility of DBSI to accurately measure axonal injury,
demyelination as well as increased inflammatory cellularity. Those pathology-specific metrics
from DBSI enable more accurate classifications of various types of MS lesions.
Different MS lesion types are associated with different CNS pathology and patient
outcomes. The pathologic correlation of PBH lesions is the severe axon loss and matrix
destruction32-34. PBHs are believed to exhibit more axon loss than other types of MS lesions
neuropathologically33. The amount of PBHs present and the volumes of those PBHs showed

positive correlations with increased MS-induced disabilities35,36. Additionally, several other
studies have shown that PBH numbers or volumes correlate with worse clinical test scores35. This
shows that PBHs have significant relevance to clinical outcomes and disease progression.
Compared to PBHs, PGHs reflect a lower degree of axonal loss. Comparisons of imaging and
neuropathology in over 100 MS lesions found with a certain degree of hypointensity was strongly
associated with axonal density37. MS lesion burden has often been reported as the sum of lesion
volumes, but the degree of tissue destruction may vary between lesions38. A quantitative method
to distinguish the degree of hypointensity in individual MS lesions could improve patient
monitoring, allow for better correlations to clinical measures, and be useful as an outcome measure
in clinical trials of potential reparative therapies37. In contrast with PBH and PGH lesions (which
are associated with axonal loss), ABH and AGH lesions are likely caused by inflammation and
edema, since most ABH/AGH lesions resolve within months of contrast resolution22. Although
these lesion types reveal different pathological characteristics, they all show hypointensity in precontrast T1W images. Clinically it is challenging to distinguish these lesions solely by expert raters
consistently. In contrast, our DNN based tool could automatically and accurately predict different
lesion types, showing great promise to effectively and efficiently assist clinicians.
MS lesion identification and segmentation based on manual tracings of structural
boundaries and signal intensity remained the most commonly used MS diagnostic method. This
method not only requires experienced radiologists or neurologists, but is also time-consuming,
expensive, and subject to operator bias, which often causes considerable inter- and intra-rater
variability39. In addition, it is difficult for a human expert to combine information from various
slices and channels when multispectral MRI data are examined40. Computer-aided analysis can
assist in identifying brain structures and lesions, extract quantitative and qualitative properties and

evaluate their progress over time. Automatic methods of image segmentation and classification
have been investigated extensively. Recently, supervised machine learning methods such as
logistic regression41, k-nearest neighbors42, support vector machine43 as well as deep convolutional
neural network (CNN)44 have been explored to segment MS lesions from normal brain regions.
However, classifications for various types of MS lesions using deep neural networks have not been
reported. Therefore, we constructed a DNN model employing DBSI metrics that showed high
capability in distinguishing different MS lesion types.
There are some limitations of this study. First, the subject number is relatively small with
only 38 MS patients included in our study cohort. However, a total of 43,261 imaging voxels from
499 MS lesions were identified by expert neurologist from three subtypes of MS patients, which
could effectively remedy the small cohort size of the study. Additionally, DBSI derived metrics
were modeled and calculated on a single voxel basis, which would address the heterogeneity of
MS lesions. Second, the data distribution was imbalanced among different lesion\region types,
which could compromise the performance of a DNN model. While the class imbalance is a
common issue in most clinical studies, DBSI provided pathology-specific features that
significantly improve the overall performance for the DNN model.

Conclusions
DHI significantly improves the accuracy of MS detection and classification for five representative
MS lesion types, especially when the overall prediction accuracy is 91.2%, which significantly
outperformed other models. The improved DHI framework could greatly assist neurologists and
neuroradiologists in making clinical decisions. The efficiency and effectiveness of this DNN
