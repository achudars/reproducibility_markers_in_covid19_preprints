Because of relatively small sample size, the incomplete data, and the different
research objects, there are some bias in the outcomes, which limits the ability
to make discrete conclusions.
There were not enough articles identified to perform a meta-analysis.

Introduction
Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) is the pathogen of human varicella and herpes zoster,
and human is the only host(Davison, 1986). An average of 4.2 million severe varicella
cases cause hospitalization or death worldwide each year (Heininger, 2006). The
incidence of herpes zoster is very high in China, and it increases with age (Macintyre,
2003) and varies from country to country, ranging from 2.0 to 4.6/1000 person/year,
without obvious geographic trend (Samuel, 2014; Pinchinat, 2013). VZV is highly

，

infectious and usually transmitted by droplets in the air and mucus in contact with the
virus. Chicken pox is more common in children, while herpes zoster is more common
in adults. Advanced age and dysfunctional cell-mediated immune responses are two
well-established risk factors for VZV reactivation(Thomas, 2004). Complications,
however, do occur, particularly in infants, pregnant women and in
immunocompromised individuals, including with postherpetic neuralgia
(PHN)(Arnou

，2011).The incidence of VZV is not related to gender, but is closely

related to season and climate, Spring and autumn are high-risk seasons. The incidence
of VZV in tropical climate is low, but the average age of VZV infection is higher (S al
leras, 2000; Takahashi, 1992]. Europe, America, Japan, Korea and China have adopted
immunization strategies to control the epidemic of VZV through vaccination. In the
sero-epidemiological investigation of VZV, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) is usually used to detect the concentration of varicella-zoster virus antibody
(VZV-IgG) in serum. The concentration of VZV-IgG (> 100 mIU/mL) is positive,
which indicates that the subjects have the ability to resist varicella virus infection.
With the immunity of the elderly decreasing, they are more susceptible to virus
infection, so that VZV incidence increases and VZV would bring serious economic
and spiritual burden to society. Because of high VZV incidence, VZV is included in
the Chinese infectious diseases report. But the prevalence of VZV is not clear to
people. The purpose of this study is to investigate the sero-prevalence of VZV in
general population, analyze the influence factor of VZV infection, and provide
theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of VZV.
1. METHODS AND DATA
1.1 Search strategy
Literatures about the immune epidemic of varicella-zoster were searched on PubMed,
the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, WANFANG database
and the Chinese Scientific Journals Full-Text Database (CQVIP), which published in
recent 30 years in China. Chinese and English search terms are "Varicella-zoster
virus", "varicella", "Herpes zoster", "Varicella immunity" and so on. The list of all

eligible studies and reviews was manually scanned to identify additional studies for
inclusion. During extraction of publications, we avoided subjective bias by omitting
names of the authors, journals, year, and country.
1.2 Inclusion criteria
All studies which aimed on VZV seropositivity in the Chinese population were
included. Of the total publications, duplicate and similar ones were identified and
excluded. Since both English and Chinese publications were included, publications
with same data but different languages were removed in the next step. The title and
abstract of the retrieved studies were independently screened by two investigators and
the full texts of the selected studies were further evaluated according to the eligibility
criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus after consultation with a third

： (1) the Chinese and English literatures of study on

reviewer. Inclusion criteria

varicella-zoster virus immunization epidemics in different regions of China; (2) The
literature has obvious age stratification; (3) The subjects are general people; (4) VZV
sero-prevalence in the population investigated by the literature research institute.
Exclusion criteria: Any study that did not contain these information was excluded.
1.3 Data Extraction and Processing
Two evaluators independently retrieved documents and extracted data. Information
about the study design, eligible population, age and gender distribution, inclusion and
exclusion criteria were checked. When they disagreed, they could solve the problem
by discussion or by soliciting opinions from third parties. Firstly, the data of all
literatures were extracted and the age stratification interval was determined. The data
was pooled according to age stratification (1-3, 4-6, 7-13, 14-19, 20-35, 36-45, > 45)
by Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The total prevalence, 95% CI confidence interval
(Lower-Upper CL) and estimate were analyzed and calculated by open-meta-analysis
software. Forest plots were drawn by Graphpad Prism, open-meta-analysis and
RevMan 5.3 software.
1.4 Statistical Method
RevMan 5.3, Graphpad Prism and open-meta-analysis software was used for
meta-analysis. The heterogeneity of the included studies was tested by χ2 test and
Cochrane Q test. The heterogeneity was determined by I2 value, I2=0 was considered
indicative of the variation between studies that was only caused by sampling error. I2
<0.5 was considered indicative of a lack of significant heterogeneity among the
included studies and a fixed-effects model was used for analysis. I2 >0.5 was
considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity and a random-effects model was
used for analysis. Meta-analysis results are represented by forest plots.
Cochrane Q test was also used to test the heterogeneity of statistical results, and the
significant level was at < 0.1. Heterogeneity calculation is the weighted sum of the
square difference between the prevalence rate in individual studies and the combined
prevalence rate in all studies, as well as the weights used in the aggregation method.
We assume that the prevalence in all studies is the same as the invalid hypothesis. To
test the heterogeneity, we calculated Q and compared it with the standard threshold
table. (Allami , 2014).

2. Results
2.1 Literature Retrieval Results
By searching Pubmed, CNKI, WANFANG and CQVIP databases, 2035 papers were
obtained. By eliminating duplicate papers, 63 papers were preliminarily obtained
through reading topics and abstracts, Which were in CNKI (n=21), Pubmed (n=39)
and other methods (n=3). 13 incomplete literatures and 35 papers without age
stratification were excluded by acquiring and reading the full text. Compare with the
age stratification criteria, 5 literatures were excluded. According to the inclusion and
exclusion criteria, 10 literatures (Cao, 1998; Wang, 2004; Li, 2016; Pan, 2003; Dong, 2017;
Wu, 2015; He, 2011; Zhou, 2006; Zheng, 2000; Guo, 2007) were included in the
meta-analysis. 11666 individuals in China were included, which was all in Chinese. A

2.2 Basic information of included study
The level of VZV antibody in healthy Chinese population was studied in 10 papers, which research data is from 1997 to 2019. The subjects
were surveyed from 10 provinces in the Chinese different geographical region (Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing, Liaoning, Sichuan, Heilongjiang,
Fujian, Zhejiang, Henan and Jiangsu), involving healthy children, residents, communities and rural populations. 11 666 individuals was
included in this cross-sectional study. The sample size of each study ranged from 320 to 3073. There was no gender difference and the age of
subjects was between 1 and 70 years old. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELlSA) was used to detect anti-VZV-IgG antibodies in serum
using ELlSA kit produced by BEEHRING, Germany. The basic information of included study was shown in Table 1.
2.3 Analysis of Heterogeneity
10 studies were pooled and statistically analyzed with the age stratification, and the Q, I2, Q/df and P values of different age groups were
calculated by random effect model and fixed effect model respectively. According to the statistical analysis method of heterogeneity, random
effect model was used to do meta-analysis in the case of significant heterogeneity. The total prevalence and its 95% confidence interval were
calculated by weighted average of individuals in 7 age groups (1-3, 4-6, 7-13, 14-19, 20-35, 36-45, and > 45 years old) (Table 2).

2.4 Prevalence of VZV
Data were collected from 10 studies according to age stratification (1-3, 4-6, 7-13, 14-19, 20-35, 36-45, and > 45) and gender. Prevalence
estimates and 95% CI confidence intervals (Lower CL-Upper CL) were calculated using open-meta-analysis software (Table 3). Confidence
areas were also calculated in Graphpad Prism software. The meta-analysis of point estimates and 95% confidence interval for VZV prevalence
in different age groups were shown as a forest plot in Fig 1. The research results displayed that at the age of 1–3, 28.30% (95% CI; 0.156-0.409)
of children showed to be infected. The seropositivity rate of VZV-IgG antibody sharply increased from 43.6% (95% CI: 0.284-0.588) at the age
of 4-6 to 74.3% (95% CI: 0.605-0.88) at the age of 7-13. The peak prevalence was seen in the age 36-45 93.50% (95% CI; 0.917-0.953) while
the VZV seroprevalence rate (82.20%, 95% CI: 0.544-1.099) was not increased in individuals of 45 and older. Trend of age-stratifed VZV
seroprevalence rates in Chinese population during 1997 to 2019 is shown in Fig 1.
Ten studies explored the seropositivity rate of VZV antibody, the estimates value of VZV prevalence and 95% confidence interval in each study
were calculated and pooled (Fig 2). Due to substantial heterogeneity, random effect model was performed in the meta-analysis. The overall
VZV seroprevalence in the Chinese population was 65.80% (95% CI; 56.5% - 75.1%). It is shown that 7616 individuals out of 11666 were
seropositive of anti-VZV-IgG antibody(Fig 3).

Figure 3 Forest plots of VZV prevalence in each study
Nine studies observed the prevalence of anti-VZV antibodies in different sexes, which data
was analyzed using Revman 5.3 software for meta-analysis. The results suggested that the
prevalence of VZV in women was slightly higher than that in men, with no statistical
significance (P>0.05) (Figure 4).

3. Discussion
Varicella or herpes zoster is an acute infectious disease infected with VZV, and its incidence
is very high all over the world. Human beings are generally susceptible to VZV. 90% of the
susceptible people who come into close contact with VZV are infected mainly through
respiratory tract. Immunity occurs after illness, and no secondary infection appeared. In vivo
antibodies can not eliminate latent varicella virus in the spinal nerve root ganglia, and herpes
zoster can still occur many years later(Liu, 2010). The predilection age of varicella is infants
and children, while herpes zoster is a recurrent disease, usually seen in adults aged 40 to 70.
There are more cases in spring and autumn.
10 studies on VZV immunity prevalence were included in this meta-analysis.
Open-meta-analysis software was used to collect and analyze the results according to age
stratification. Cochrane Q test and I2 test were used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the
results. The results showed that the prevalence of VZV in all age stratification had greater or
lesser heterogeneity. In all reports, an age-dependent pattern was demonstrated in VZV
seropositivity. Seropositivity rates were low in the early childhood as the frequency of
positive samples was 28.30% (95% CI; 15.6-40.9) during the first 1-3 years. The VZV
seroprevalence increased from 28.3% in 1-3 years old to 43.6% in 4-6 years old. The VZV
prevalence at the age of 7-13 years old was similar to that at the age of 14-19 years old, 74.3%
and 79.8% respectively, and was about three times higher than that of 1-3 years old and more
than 30% higher than that of 4-6 years old. By the age 20-35 years, VZV seroprevalence of

young people steeply rose to 92.4% and at the age of 36-45 years, 93.5% of the population
had already been infected by VZV. VZV prevalence of 36-45 years old was close to that of
20-35 years old. Finally, 82.2% of elderly people were seropositive for anti-VZV antibodies
by the age of 45 and more, which was lower than that of the age group of 20-45 years old.
There was some heterogeneity in the VZV prevalence of 1-3, 4-6, 7-13, 14-19, 36-45 and
over 45 years old. Random effect model was used to analyze the data and there was
significant statistical significance. No heterogeneity in the statistical results of VZV
prevalence is between 20 and 35 years old, and fixed effect model (I2 = 0, P = 0.437) was
used to meta-analysis. The results of this study was consistent with those of Allami et al.
(Abbas, 2014), but the age stratification of the two studies is different. The prevalence of VZV
in Iran is 89.54% in the age group of 26-30 years old, followed by 85.92% in the age group of
31-40 years old. The VZV prevalence of children in China is 28.3% in the age group of 1-3
years old, 43.6% in 4-6 years old, and 74.3% in 7-13 years old, which is higher than Iran
(21.96% in 1-5 years old, 42.09% in 6-10 years old, 59.44% in 11-15 years old). The
prevalence of VZV in both studies over 40 years old is over 80%. It is found that the
seroprevalence of VZV increased with age before the age of 45, which is approved by results
of Mahamud et al. (Mahamud, 2014). Before introducing the routine varicella vaccination
program, the VZV seroprevalence among students of American Samoa University and
elementary school increased with age, from 76.0% at the age of 4-6 to 97.7% by the age of 23
and more. In contrast to the research results of Pinchinat et al. (Pinchinat, 2013), Pinchinat
found that the incidence of herpes zoster in Europe increased with age and became more
serious after age 50.
Ten studies were distributed in six southern provinces and cities (Zhejiang, Shanghai, Fujian,
Guangdong, Jiangsu, Sichuan) and four northern provinces and cities (Beijing, Liaoning,
Heilongjiang, Henan). According to the VZV prevalence in each study, open-meta-analysis
software was used to conduct a summary analysis, and the heterogeneity of each study was
evaluated by Cochrane Q test and I2 test. Eight studies were selected to independently study
the prevalence rate of VZV in a certain region. The results found that compared with that in
the southern region, the VZV prevalence in the northern region (Harbin 71.5%, Beijing
Chaoyang 96.6% and Luohe 72.4%) was higher than that in the southern region (Fuzhou
68.7%, Jinhua 63.0%, Shanghai 42.8%, Hangzhou and Taizhou 58.5%, and Maoming 46.4%),
which was basically similar to the VZV seropositive rate between tropical and temperate
regions in Iraq(Allami , 2014).
By analyzing the influence of gender on the VZV prevalence in nine studies, it was found that
the average prevalence of VZV in women was 62.71%, and that in men was 62.07%. The

，

VZV prevalence in women was slightly higher than that in men (P>0.05 no statistical
difference), which was consistent with the results of Pinchinat et al. (Pinchinat, 2013). The
incidence of VZV in women was also higher than that in men, and the difference increased
with age. Compared with Amjadi et al. (Amjadi, 2017), the prevalence rate of VZV in
Chinese women was 62.71%, which was lower than that in Iranian women (80.47%). Dong
Yanhong et al. (Dong, 2017) found that the VZV prevalence of the elderly that was 96.56% in
Chaoyang District of Beijing was slightly higher than that of 95.30% in Iran. Due to the
decrease of immunity, the elderly was more susceptible to VZV infection.
This Chinese study with total VZV seropositivity rate 65.8% (95% CI:56.5-75.1%) came to a
same conclusion with Iranian’s (78.50% ) and Polish(76.6%) rate of VZV prevalence (Amjadi,
2017; Siennicka et al.,2009).
4. Conclusion
In summary, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, this study included 10 studies
on the prevalence of VZV published from 1997 to 2017 in different regions of China. Results

from this study demonstrated a close relationship between seroprevalence and age, but no
close correlation with gender, rural/urban areas and geographical regions of China(Siennicka
et al., 2009). The meta-analysis showed that the VZV seroprevalence increased with age, and
there was no significant difference between different genders. The prevalence of VZV in
northern areas was higher than that in southern areas. From 1997 to 2019, there was a
tendency that the VZV prevalence was increasing year by year, so the public health
prevention of VZV needs to be further strengthened to benefit people's health. The
seroepidemiological survey of VZV is helpful to understand the status of VZV infection in
healthy people and to assess the risk of herpes zoster.
