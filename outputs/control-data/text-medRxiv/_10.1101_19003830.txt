ABSTRACT
Background

Sexual network degree, a count of ongoing partnerships, plays a critical role in the
transmission dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually
transmitted infections (STI). Researchers often quantify degree using self-reported crosssectional data on the day of survey, which may result in bias because of uncertainty
about future sexual activity.

Methods

We evaluated the bias of a cross-sectional degree measure with a prospective cohort
study of men who have sex with men (MSM). At baseline, we asked men about whether
recent sexual partnerships were ongoing. We confirmed the true, ongoing status of those
partnerships at baseline at follow-up. With logistic regression, we estimated the
partnership-level predictors of baseline measure accuracy. With Poisson regression, we
estimated the longitudinally confirmed degree as a function of baseline predicted degree.

Results

Across partnership types, the baseline ongoing status measure was 70% accurate, with
higher negative predictive value (91%) than positive predictive value (39%). Partnership
exclusivity and racial pairing were associated with higher accuracy. Baseline degree
generally overestimated confirmed degree. Bias, or number of ongoing partners different
than predicted at baseline, was -0.28 overall, ranging from -1.91 to -0.41 for MSM with
any ongoing partnerships at baseline. Comparing MSM of the same baseline degree, the
level of bias was stronger for black compared to white MSM, and for younger compared
to older MSM.

Conclusions

Research studies may overestimate degree when it is quantified cross-sectionally.
Adjustment and structured sensitivity analyses may account for bias in studies of HIV or
STI prevention interventions.

INTRODUCTION
An estimated 1.1 million persons in the United States were living with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), with 40,000 new diagnoses occurring in 2017.1 Despite substantial progress in the
development of new tools for HIV prevention, including preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), incidence
has stabilized in the past half-decade.2 Men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 66% of
new HIV diagnoses but less than 5% of the population in 2017,3 and new cases have increased
among several marginalized MSM subgroups such as young black and Hispanic MSM.2 Meeting HIV
prevention targets, such as the newly established Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan calling for a 90%
reduction in HIV incidence by 2030,4 will require sustained efforts to understand the drivers of HIV
infection among MSM, the causes of disparities, and optimal methods for targeting prevention tools.
Networks of sexual partnerships have long been a focus of HIV research.5 A network framework
addresses the ongoing challenge that individual-level behavior and biology, by themselves, do not
sufficiently explain the size of the HIV epidemic.6 Sexual partner concurrency, defined by having two
or more ongoing partnerships, has been identified as a central explanatory cause for the shape of
the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and the large sex differentials in HIV prevalence there.7,8
Concurrency amplifies the speed of HIV transmission across the population, compared to serial
monogamy with the same number of cumulative partners.9 Concurrency is a binary categorization of
momentary network degree (hereafter, degree), which is the number of ongoing partners at any
point in time. Sexual networks may be characterized by a range of features, but degree, assortative
mixing, and partnership duration are three important measures for HIV transmission.10 Recent
network studies among MSM have characterized the interacting effects of these three features on
the trajectory of HIV incidence.11,12
Network degree and duration are typically measured through cross-sectional study designs
given the difficulty in longitudinal assessment. Although the time period for quantifying degree in
these designs has been debated,13 one preferred approach is a measure on the day of study. Use of
day-of-study degree is preferred because it allows for joint estimation of degree and duration
following common statistical assumptions.14 Duration may be based on partnership start and end
dates with the latter censored for ongoing partnerships. A challenge with the day-of-study degree
measure, however, is that it requires study participants to predict whether partnerships will continue.
Because of uncertainty in that prediction, measured degree may be a biased estimator of true

degree. If the ongoing status of partnerships is systematically overpredicted, estimates for network
degree and partnership duration would be biased upward.
Assessment of bias in estimates of network degree is uncommon because of the validation data
needed. Linked partnership studies have evaluated agreement in degree within sexual dyads, and
retrospective studies have evaluated temporal changes in degree over time.15,16 But no studies have
assessed the accuracy of a day-of-study degree measure. Such bias assessment would require
prospective data in which persons would be asked at follow-up to confirm whether partnerships
reported as ongoing at baseline were truly ongoing, and whether those reported as not ongoing were
truly not. The bias in the cross-sectional only degree measurement would likely have important
heterogeneity by demographic characteristics. If black MSM misreport degree more than white
MSM, for example, the explanatory power of degree for research on racial disparities is weakened.17
Bias also likely varies by partnership characteristics, such as partnership type; ongoing status is less
often known in casual partnerships.18 However, the epidemiologic impact of this bias for casual
partnerships may be less than for main partnerships because the former are shorter in duration.
Validation of degree measures has important implications for both mathematical modeling
research and applied prevention activities. Biases in these network parameters could result in
incorrect projections for mathematical models that simulate disease transmission dynamics or
intervention effects.10 Network features are often used, implicitly or explicitly, in many HIV/STI
prevention activities such as partner notification to prevent within-partnership reinfection,20 and in
novel HIV/STI prevention interventions that target broader features of the sexual network structure.21
In this study, we use prospective cohort data on reported partnerships to quantify how
accurately participants predicted the continuing status of their partnerships, as well as the total
number of ongoing partnerships (degree). To maximally inform HIV/STI prevention and
mathematical modeling activities, we evaluated how accuracy, as well as negative and positive
predictive values, varied across definitions of baseline degree, and by key factors. Our broader goal
was to estimate the level of potential bias in degree to generate bias adjustment factors for future
HIV/STI prevention research and interventions.

METHODS
Study Design. This analysis used data from Involvement, a prospective cohort study in 2010–2014,
to investigate multilevel factors for HIV risk among black and white MSM in the Atlanta metropolitan

area.22 Study procedures included a standardized survey measuring behavioral, biologic, and sexual
network attributes hypothesized to influence HIV risk. We recruited study participants through
structured time–location sampling of sites where MSM congregated in Atlanta, supplemented with
web-based recruitment. We purposefully selected locations and time periods to increase enrollment
of black MSM to ensure a balanced cohort.
Enrollment eligibility criteria were male sex, age between 18 and 39, non-Hispanic black or
white race, residence in the Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area, at least one male sex partner
within the past three months, and not being in a mutually monogamous (either the participant or their
partners were not exclusive) relationship. Overall, 560 of the 803 participants screened as HIVnegative at baseline and enrolled into the cohort for follow-up. At each follow-up, participants
received HIV and bacterial STI screening and completed additional behavioral surveys. Previous
reports have described the sampling, recruitment, and enrollment protocols in further detail.22,23 The
Emory University Institutional Review Board approved this study.
Measures. Our analyses included measures at the baseline and Month 6 (M6) follow-up visits. At
baseline, participants reported on up to their five most recent partners over the prior 6 months.
Specific question wording for relevant measures from these two surveys are included in eFigure 1.
Questions included whether participants considered these partnerships as ongoing (those in which
participant expected to have sexual contact again). Participants could report yes, no, or don’t know
to these questions. At the M6 visit, we asked participants again about the same partners they
reported on at baseline, including whether any sexual activity occurred after the baseline visit. The
ongoing status at baseline of those partnerships reported could be confirmed with this M6 data in
that way. The surveys included additional questions on the duration and frequency of sexual acts
within the partnership, reported on previously,23 but those measures were not needed in this analysis
as we considered partnerships only by their ongoing status (i.e., partnerships were not stratified in
this analysis based on the subsequent duration or number of acts after baseline).
Degree refers to the sum of all ongoing partnerships at baseline. Baseline Degree is the
number of ongoing partnerships reported on baseline data only, and Confirmed Degree is the
baseline degree confirmed with M6 data. Confirmed degree would be lower than baseline degree if
partnerships categorized as ongoing at baseline were not truly ongoing upon reevaluation at M6.
Confirmed degree would be higher than baseline degree if partnerships categorized as not ongoing

at baseline were truly ongoing upon reevaluation at M6. We define the bias in baseline degree as
the difference between confirmed degree and baseline degree.
For this analysis, we excluded partnerships with women, those missing ongoing partnership
status at baseline or month 6 follow-up, and partners with an unknown confirmed degree measure.
We evaluated several individual predictors for degree agreement and bias, including age, race, and
number of male sex partners. Partner-level covariates for predictions of accuracy for specific
relationships included partnership type, frequency of sexual contact, race combination, age
homophily, perceived concordant HIV status, and agreement about having outside sexual
partnerships. Partnerships were categorized as main (primary with repeated sexual contacts), casual
(non-primary but repeated sexual contacts), and one-time as of baseline. Participants could project
that partnerships that were one-time as of baseline could continue in the same way as partnerships
with multiple acts (casual or main partnerships). Participants could misclassify different relationships
as ongoing or not, while still correctly estimating their overall momentary degree, if the numbers
misclassified in each direction were equal.
Statistical Analyses. To evaluate how well baseline ongoing status was predicted by confirmed M6
data, we calculated positive predictive value (proportion of partnerships predicted at baseline as
ongoing that were confirmed ongoing), negative predictive value (proportion of partnerships
predicted at baseline as not ongoing that were confirmed not ongoing), and accuracy (proportion of
partnerships for which the baseline and M6 ongoing status values matched). We defined unknown
baseline status as either not ongoing (unknown=no) or missing (unknown=missing; observations
were dropped) to evaluate sensitivity to missing data assumptions.
We then used partnership-level logistic regression models (analytic unit: partnerships) to
estimate predictors of accuracy of baseline ongoing status within partnerships. Partnership-level
predictors of interest were race and age homophily, frequency of sex, perceived partner HIV status,
and agreement about outside sexual partnerships. Sandwich variance estimators for robust standard
errors were used to calculate 95% confidence intervals to account for clustering of partnerships
within participants. Finally, we estimated the association between baseline and confirmed degree
with individual-level Poisson regression models (analytic unit: participants) for main and casual
partnership types. Baseline degree was the primary predictor, confirmed degree was the outcome,

and race and age were included as hypothesized confounders. These models were used to estimate
the direction and magnitude of the degree bias. All analyses were conducted using R 3.5.3.

RESULTS
Compared to all MSM enrolled in the Involvement cohort, the analytic sample (N = 469) were of a
similar race and age composition (Table 1). With respect to partnership characteristics, partnerships
in the analytic sample (N = 1397) were more likely to be main and casual than one-time partnerships
compared to those reported by the full cohort (N = 1758). Most partnerships (94%) were within the
same race and nearly 40% were perceived to be HIV discordant (meaning the reported partner was
HIV-infected, given that the cohort enrolled only HIV-uninfected MSM at baseline) or unknown
(meaning the partner’s HIV status was unknown).
Table 2 shows the accuracy of the baseline reported ongoing status, as confirmed with the M6
data as the gold standard. The sum of partnerships with baseline and confirmed ongoing statuses of
each partnership equals the baseline and confirmed degree for each participant, respectively;
marginal degree distributions are reported in eTable 1. Overall, there was largely consistency
between the two measures (accuracy > 50%), with variation by partnership type and classification of
unknown status partnerships. Limited to known baseline ongoing status (yes/no responses only,
where baseline unknown responses were set to missing), accuracy was 63% overall, highest in main
partnerships (69%), and lowest in casual partnerships (58%). When classifying unknown status
partnerships as not ongoing, accuracy overall improved to 70% and increased to 72% in one-time
partnerships. The row percentages may be interpreted as positive and negative predictive values
when unknown ongoing partnerships were classified as missing. These show that the accuracy is
driven by the negative predictive values (86%–92%), which was much higher than positive predictive
values (19%–58%). The negative predictive values are reduced when classifying unknown ongoing
partnerships as not ongoing (the positive predictive values would not change with this different
classification of these partnerships).
Table 3 presents the results of logistic regression models for partnership-level predictors of
accuracy of the baseline ongoing status. The categorization of accuracy was the same as in Table 2.
Accuracy of baseline degree measures was higher in partnerships with smaller age gaps, white–
white racial composition, main partnership type (compared to casual partnership type), and
agreement about partnership exclusivity. When unknown status partnerships were coded as not

ongoing, each 5-year increase in absolute age gap was associated with 9% lower odds of accuracy.
That association was strengthened (OR = 0.87 versus 0.91) when treating unknown partnerships as
missing. White–white partnerships across types were 1.4 times more accurate compared to black–
black partnerships, and the effect was larger in main white–white partnerships compared to casual
white–white partnerships. Partnership agreements about exclusivity with respect to outside partners
were associated with accuracy, but this was driven by main partnerships. Perceived HIV status and
coital frequency had minimal and inconsistent relationships to accuracy.
In Table 4, we show the result of the Poisson regression models estimating the association
between confirmed degree (outcome) and baseline degree (predictor). Marginal degree distributions
for both degree measures are provided in Supplemental Table 1. Models are stratified by
participants who had main and casual partnerships (n = 405), any main partnerships (n = 220), or
any casual partnerships (n = 299). We also ran models for the different classifications of unknown
baseline status partnerships, and with adjustment for participant age and race. Baseline degree was
strongly associated with confirmed degree across partnership types, for both unknown status
classification methods and after demographic adjustment. Positive values of these regression
coefficients indicate an increase in predicted confirmed degree with each one-unit increase in
baseline degree: confirmed degree increased by a relative factor of 1.6 (e0.48) with each increase in
baseline degree. The coefficient sizes were greater and confidence intervals wider for estimation
with unknown baseline degree coded as missing as a result of greater effect size but smaller sample
size.
The bias in baseline degree for was -0.28 overall when unknown ongoing partnerships were
coded as not ongoing and -0.49 when coded as missing. This bias also emerged in estimates of
concurrency, or the proportion of men exhibiting a degree of 2 or more across main and casual
partnerships. The proportion of participants concurrent using baseline degree only was 17.2% when
unknown ongoing partnerships were coded as not ongoing and 22.0% when coded as missing. The
proportion of participants concurrent based on confirmed degree was 9.6%.
The Figure shows the predicted difference between confirmed and baseline degree as a
function of baseline degree from the model in which unknown baseline partnerships were classified
as not ongoing. If baseline degree perfectly predicted confirmed degree, the estimates (points)
would fall on the horizontal dashed line representing no difference between baseline and confirmed
degrees. The plots were stratified by partnership type, with x-axis ranges limited to the range of

empiric data for each type. Confirmed degree was 0.28, 0.59, and 1.25 for those with baseline
degrees of 0, 1, and 2 main partnerships, respectively. The corresponding bias sizes were therefore
0.28, -0.41, and -0.75. Confirmed degree was 0.26, 0.44, 0.74, 1.24, 2.09, and 3.51 for those with
baseline degree of 0 to 5 casual partnerships, respectively. The corresponding bias sizes were 0.26,
-0.56, -1.26, -1.76, -1.91, and -1.49. Therefore, baseline degree overestimated confirmed degree for
MSM engaged in any ongoing partnerships (degree > 0), but underestimated degree for MSM in no
ongoing partnerships at baseline.
In eFigure 2, we present the model-estimated confirmed degree as a function of baseline
degree rather than the bias itself, stratified by race and age group instead of partnership type. A
perfect prediction of degree from baseline degree would result in the point estimates overlapping
with the diagonal dashed identity line. The associations here were similar to the main text Figure
with respect to baseline degree as the primary predictor of interest. However, the level of bias was
greater for younger MSM (age 18–29) compared to older MSM and for black MSM compared to
white MSM. For example, for MSM with a baseline degree of 2, the predicted confirmed degree was
0.65 for Black MSM aged 18–29, 0.94 for White MSM aged 18–29, 0.79 for Black MSM aged 30–39,
and 1.15 for White MSM aged 30–39.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated the potential for bias in estimating sexual network degree using only a
cross-sectional (“day-of-study”) measure by reconfirming the ongoing status of partnerships with
prospective cohort data. We found high accuracy of the baseline ongoing status using this
longitudinal data as the standard, with generally greater accuracy in main compared to casual
partnerships but with the results dependent upon categorization of unknown status partnerships.
Baseline degree overestimated true network degree when confirmed longitudinally, with the level of
bias ranging from -1.91 to -0.41 for men with any ongoing partnerships. Baseline degree
underestimated true degree for men with no predicted ongoing partnerships at baseline (0.26–0.28
average bias). The bias across baseline degree for main and casual partnerships was -0.28. These
results held across partnership type and other covariates, but the bias was higher for younger and
for black MSM.
These findings have implications for how we measure and interpret network degree and related
network measures. Our study provides strong support for the need to validate network measures

such as degree. Errors in the classification of the ongoing status of partnerships also impact
estimation of partnership duration, since partnerships assumed to be ongoing have a censored end
date, leading to a overestimation of duration if partnerships are truly not ongoing.14,24 From an HIV
transmission perspective, overestimation of degree and duration may lead to conclusions that MSM
networks are riskier than they truly are. After confirmation with longitudinal data, the fraction
exhibiting concurrency was roughly half of that estimated based on baseline data alone (9.6%
versus 17.2%). Although the biases in degree found here appear small, minor differences in network
measures at the individual-level can cascade into large network-level outcomes like the temporal
network path reachable by infectious disease pathogens.25
Biases in network measurements have consequences for using networks to explain HIV
disparities by race in the U.S. HIV disparities research has been challenged over the past two
decades to identify explanatory factors for the large racial disparities in HIV prevalence; individuallevel risk factors (e.g., coital frequency and condom use) have consistently been equal or lower in
the group with higher prevalence (i.e., black MSM).6,17 Empirical studies across multiple populations
of MSM have suggested some racial differences in network degree, although the results are not
consistent.22,26,27 We found that the level of bias in degree measurements was higher for black MSM
compared to white MSM, and conversely the accuracy of baseline ongoing status was highest in
white–white partnerships. We had hypothesized that the groups with higher HIV incidence (black
MSM) would overestimate degree less than groups with lower incidence (white MSM), which would
strengthen the role of network factors in understanding disparities.17 We found just the opposite: a
greater overestimation of degree for black MSM. This suggests that the explanatory power of
network factors in explaining disparities could be diluted.
The estimated biases support reevaluation of network measures used in epidemiologic
research. Network-based mathematical modeling research in particular depends on unbiased
measures of degree and duration to simulate HIV transmission dynamics.21 Our findings that bias
was higher in casual compared to main partnerships and for MSM with larger baseline degrees
suggests empiric models may have overestimated the role of these factors for explaining HIV
transmission.17,28 Intervention models projecting the impact of new prevention strategies (such as
HIV PrEP) based on network structure may also overestimate effectiveness if model parameters for
degree are inaccurate.10,19

Network measures such as degree may be used for a number of public health activities,
including STI partner notification. The goal of partner notification is to diagnose and treat (or link to
treatment) partners of index patients recently diagnosed with an STI.20 This prevents both reinfection
to the index patient by infected partners and further dissemination of infection to other partners in the
sexual network.29 Due to funding constraints, health departments tasked with partner notification
must select which partners are the highest priority to contact;30 to prevent repeat index infections
(e.g., of curable bacterial STIs) the priority would be ongoing partnerships. Our findings suggest
considerable uncertainty in defining those partnerships, which may create inefficiencies in targeting
that should be considered further.
Limitations. First, we excluded 16% of individuals and 21% of partnerships enrolled in the cohort,
largely due to missing or unknown data for baseline or confirmed (M6) degree. This resulted in fewer
one-time partnerships and more main/casual partnerships, which could have resulted in a higher
level of estimated of bias if they had been included. Second, other factors within the longitudinal
study design may have resulted in lower degree at follow-up in a way that could contribute to the
observed biases: 1) participant recall issues about partnerships at baseline; and 2) participant
knowledge at follow-up that the study survey is completed faster when reporting on fewer partners.
Although it is impossible to know how much these alternative explanations could have affected the
results, they were our primary motivation to limit the comparisons to baseline and Month 6 data and
not data from subsequent follow-up visits. Finally, the study truncated data collection at the 5 most
recent partners, which could result in underestimation of baseline degree; however, as eTable 1
shows, the number of participants reporting a degree of 4 or 5 was small.
Conclusions. Our findings may have at least five implications for future network research. Our
conclusions may be most applicable to MSM sexual networks that were the focus of this analysis,
but could impact measurement of degree in other study populations depending upon transportability
assumptions.31 First, if longitudinal degree data are available for other target populations, one may
directly quantify potential biases using our methods. Second, if longitudinal data are not available
and it is reasonable to transport our estimates, applying our estimated bias factors to other crosssectional estimates may suffice. Third, if longitudinal data are not available but unknown ongoing
status is measured, reclassifying unknown partnerships to not ongoing may reduce bias, as it did
here. Fourth, if retrospective data on degree at multiple time points is available, comparison of

degree over time would be a useful evaluation of measure stability. Previous studies have directly
compared measures of concurrency across retrospective time points;13,32 this would be a useful
exercise for network degree and other network measures more generally. Fifth, with any of the
above four approaches to degree adjustment and evaluation above, structured sensitivity analyses,
with degree ranging from that observed value to the estimated biased value, will help to understand
how biased degree measures could impact the primary study outcome or clinical decision.33 We
hope this will inform future research or public health practice activities that incorporate degree and
related network measures.
