Abstract:

13

Background: Depression is a common comorbidity of tuberculosis (TB) and is associated with poor adherence to

14

treatment of multiple disorders. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the existing evidence on the

15

relationship between depression and negative outcomes of TB treatment.

16

Methods: We systematically reviewed studies that evaluated depressive symptoms (DS) directly or indirectly

17

through psychological distress (PD) and measured negative treatment outcomes of drug-sensitive pulmonary TB,

18

defined as death, loss to follow-up, or non-adherence. Sources included PubMed, Global Health Library, Embase,

19

Scopus and Web of Science from inception to August 2019.

20

Results: Of the 2,970 studies initially identified, eight articles were eligible for inclusion and two were used for the

21

primary outcome meta-analysis. We found a strong association between DS and negative TB treatment outcomes

22

(OR=4.26; CI95%:2.33-7.79; I²=0%). DS were also associated with loss to follow-up (OR=8.70; CI95%:6.50-11.64;

23

I²=0%) and death (OR=2.85; CI95%:1.52-5.36; I²=0%). Non-adherence was not associated with DS and PD

24

(OR=1.34; CI95%:0.70-2.72; I²=94.36) or PD alone (OR=0.92; CI95%:0.81-1.05; I²=0%).

25

Conclusions: DS are associated with the negative TB treatment outcomes of death and loss to follow-up.

26

Considerable heterogeneity exists in the definition of depression and outcomes such as non-adherence across the

27

limited number of studies on this topic.

Introduction

30

The high burden of tuberculosis (TB) on morbidity and mortality around the world constitutes a significant public

31

health concern, especially in low and middle-income countries [1–3]. The World Health Organization (WHO)

32

estimated that 10 million people developed active TB disease in 2017 [4]. Treatment is given through the Direct

33

Observation Therapy, Short-Course program (DOTS), and cure rates have been reported at 80% in 2012 and 82% in

34

2018 [4,5]. However, certain factors like poverty, poor access to health services, and mental illness, including

35

depression and substance abuse, have a negative effect on treatment adherence. Decreased compliance often leads to

36

treatment default, which not only increases the probability of medical complications such as developing MDR-TB or

37

death but also results in greater expenditure for the public healthcare system [6].

38
39

Mental illness is also an important global health concern, with depression affecting nearly 121 million people

40

worldwide [7]. The lifetime risk of suffering from depression among the general population is 7.2% in women and

41

4.3% in men [8]. Among patients with comorbidities, the prevalence of depression is even greater (25-33%)[1]. For

42

example, 26.8% of patients with hypertension and 8-18% of patients with diabetes mellitus also struggle with

43

depression [9,10].

44
45

Both tuberculosis and depression share common risk factors, which explain the high prevalence of their

46

comorbidity, reported to range from 10-52% [11–13]. Their interaction is complex since one disease might

47

contribute to the development of the other. On one hand, the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines characteristic

48

of depression leads to decreased activation of the cellular and humoral immune systems, which contributes to the

49

development of TB [12]. On the other hand, TB infection causes chronic inflammation, releasing pro-inflammatory

50

cytokines that activate brain enzymes, such as indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, that degrade tryptophan and thereby

51

limit serotonin production. Anti-tuberculosis medications may also play a role in psychiatric disease: isoniazid alters

52

serotonin uptake and high doses of ethambutol have been associated with depression [13].

53
54

Most studies on the comorbidity of TB and depression reveal a significant correlation between depression and poor

55

adherence to TB treatment, as well as higher rates of treatment failure, development of antimicrobial resistance, and

56

higher mortality rates [3,12,14]. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize all the available data on the

Search strategy and selection criteria

62

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis that followed the recommendations in the PRISMA Statement

63

to report our findings. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Universidad

64

Peruana Cayetano Heredia (SIDISI: 103321). The study protocol was included in the PROSPERO database

65

(CRD42018111058).

66
67

We searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, Global Health Library, Embase, Scopus and Web of

68

Science for English language articles published any time up to August 9, 2019: grey literature was not considered.

69

The search strategy included the terms: “Tuberculosis”, “Depression”, and “Depressive disorder”. Detailed search

70

strategies for PubMed are described in Table 1. Strategies for all other databases used are included in Appendix A.

Cross-sectional, case-control, cohort and clinical trial studies with information on depression and negative TB

75

treatment outcomes were considered for review. For the primary analysis, negative outcomes included death and

76

loss to follow-up during TB treatment; for exploratory analysis, studies that provided information on non-adherence

77

were also included. The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, depression, and outcomes were defined as per each

78

study. Studies that included information exclusively on individuals under the age of 16, inpatients, non-pulmonary

79

TB, or drug-resistant TB were excluded. For the primary analysis, only studies that provided the number of

80

depressed and non-depressed individuals with and without negative treatment outcomes were included. For the

81

secondary analysis, all of the available studies were included.

Outcome definitions

84

The primary endpoint extracted was the number of depressed and non-depressed individuals with and without

85

treatment outcomes in order to assess the association between depression and negative outcomes (death and loss to

86

follow-up during the TB treatment). The secondary endpoints included all of the studies that provided at least an

87

effect size measure and confidence interval for the association between depression and negative TB treatment

88

outcomes; each outcome was also evaluated individually. The exploratory endpoints included non-adherence as an

89

outcome when assessing studies.

90
91

Data extraction and quality assessment

92

The titles and abstracts of all identified articles were sorted by the author’s last name and were split into two halves.

93

Both halves were independently evaluated in duplicate by two investigators (The first half by RC and AD, and the

94

second half by AS and PRG) to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. A more inclusive approach was

95

employed during this phase in order to increase the sensitivity of article selection for the full-text analysis.

96
97

The manuscripts included for full-text analysis were sorted according to the author’s last name and divided into two

98

halves. Both halves were independently evaluated in duplicate by two investigators, who then proceeded to identify

99

which articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Due to a high volume of articles that indirectly

100

classified depression concomitantly with anxiety using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), a decision

101

to include them in the systematic review was made. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a fifth

102

reviewer (CUG).

103
104

Two assessment tools were used to evaluate the quality of the papers included in our study. Both were independently

105

evaluated by two investigators (RC and AS) and disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer

106

(PRG). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for case-control and cohort studies and the National Institutes

107

of Health’s (NIH) assessment tool for cross-sectional studies and controlled intervention studies [15,16].

We estimated summary ORs with 95% confidence intervals using the random effects approach with the metaan

111

Results

115

The database search conducted on August 9, 2019, found 2144 records after the removal of duplicates. All titles and

116

abstracts were screened and 2081 were excluded. Figure 1 depicts the study selection process. 63 articles were

117

assessed through a full-text evaluation and only eight met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review: four

118

measured depression directly through the use of validated scales (CES-D, PHQ-9, ICD-10) and four measured

119

depression indirectly through the use of the K-10 scale for psychological distress. The total number of participants

120

from the eight included studies was 12313.

121
122

Figure 1: Study selection

123
124

All studies that measured depression among TB patients had a longitudinal design with the exception of Yan et al.

125

which was a cross-sectional study. Depression was measured using both a 5-item and full version of the CES-D

126

scale, the ICD-10 criteria, and the PHQ-9 scale. Three studies measured depression at baseline and at the end of the

127

intensive phase of TB treatment, two studies measured it at the end of treatment, one measured it at monthly

128

intervals, and one did not provide information regarding the measurement timing of depressive symptoms.

129

Outcomes were defined as per local guidelines, which reflected the definition of WHO recommendations for TB

130

treatment outcomes [17]. Specifically, loss to follow-up was defined as not taking medication for at least 30 days

131

without a recommendation from the treating physician. Only Yan et al. measured non-adherence using the Morisky

132

Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8)[18]. Analysis of TB treatment outcomes revealed a higher risk of negative

133

outcomes, lower success rate, and worse adherence to treatment among patients who presented DS. Ugarte-Gil et al.

134

reported an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.46 for treatment default or death in patients with symptoms suggestive of a

135

major depressive episode (MDE) at baseline visit. Ambaw et al. also found an increased risk for loss to follow-up

136

and death (RR=9.09 and 2.99, respectively) in persons with an MDE score suggestive of depression at baseline. Yan

137

et al. showed that in comparison with individuals with low depression scores, those with high scores had a greater

150

were starting treatment or re-treatment within one month of the start date. Tola et al. also measured PD at baseline,

151

defined as two months from the start of TB treatment, and at the end of treatment. Tola et al. classified poor

152

treatment outcomes as treatment failure, loss to follow-up, and death. Peltzer et al. and Naidoo et al. defined non-

153

adherence as taking less than 90% of the medication in the last three to four weeks based on self-report, and Theron

154

et al. considered non-adherence as missing one DOTS appointment. Theron et al. measured PD at baseline and at

155

two and six months after baseline. Tola et al. reported an association between treatment outcome and PD in the sixth

156

month after the start of treatment (adjusted OR=2.87). Neither Peltzer et al. nor Naidoo et al. found an association

For the primary analyses, the only two studies (n=973) that provided the raw number of TB patients exposed and not

effect size (OR=4.26, CI95%: 2.33 - 7.79), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I²=0%). Figure 2.

For the three articles included in the secondary meta-analysis, summary measurements were estimated using

provided effect size measures and confidence intervals. Two of the studies directly measured depression and one PD

170

(n=1303). We found a strong association between depression and negative TB treatment outcomes (OR=4.05;

171

CI95%:2.34-6.89) and no evidence of heterogeneity (I²=0%). Exploratory meta-analysis showed that depression was

172

associated with both death (Two articles, n=973, OR=2.85; CI95%:1.52-5.36) and loss to follow-up (Two articles,

173

n=973, OR=8.70; CI95%:6.50-11.64) and, again, no evidence of heterogeneity was found (I²=0%). Exploratory

174

meta-analysis showed no association between DS or PD and non-adherence (Three articles, n=9349, OR=1.34;

175

CI95%:0.70-2.72) with high heterogeneity (I²=94·36). Finally, PD alone was not associated with non-adherence to

176

TB treatment, and this lack of association was accompanied by low heterogeneity (Two articles, n=8007, OR=0.925;

177

CI95%:0.81-1.05; I²=0). Figure 3.

All studies underwent individual evaluation for their quality of evidence. The case-control and cohort studies were

183

assessed by the NOS; all four studies met the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) standards for

184

good quality evidence. The cross-sectional studies were also classified as good quality evidence by the NIH

185

assessment tools. The only controlled intervention study included was rated poorly by the NIH assessment tools due

186

to deficiencies in its description of the randomization and masking process, treatment allocation methodology, and

187

subgroup analysis.

188
189

For the primary analysis, Cochrane GRADE scores for negative outcomes were defined as being of low quality due

190

to the studies’ observational designs. Given the overall small sample size, the quality of evidence was downgraded

191

on the basis of imprecision, but it was not affected by the risk of bias, inconsistency, or indirectness. Additionally, it

192

was upgraded on account of its large effect size. Publication bias could not be established due to the low number of

193

published manuscripts on the subject.

194
195

Discussion

196

This systematic review of the impact of depression on negative TB treatment outcomes suggests that depressive

197

symptoms are significantly associated with death and loss to follow-up during TB treatment (OR=4.26). Across the

198

eight studies included in the analysis, the combination of depressive symptoms and psychological distress also

199

significantly increases the odds of negative TB treatment outcomes (OR=4.05). Neither DS nor PD appear to be

200

associated with non-adherence during TB treatment (OR=1.34).

201
202

In order to properly interpret these results, several factors concerning the measurements of exposure, outcomes,

203

possible confounders must be addressed. First, in relation to the exposure, the main analysis included studies that

204

used both direct (DS) and indirect (PD) measurements of depression as predictors. Although depressive symptoms

205

and psychological distress are correlated, the scales used to measure DS (one short and full version of the CES-D,

206

ICD-10 and the PHQ-9) focused solely on depression, while the scale used to quantify PD (the K-10 scale)

207

measured not only depressive but also anxiety-related symptoms. A high PD score thus might have actually

208

represented mild depression with severe anxiety. This variation could explain why DS was more strongly associated

209

with negative TB treatment outcomes than PD alone or the combination of DS and PD [19,20].

210
211

Furthermore, within each measurement of exposure, different psychometric instruments and cut-off scores were

212

employed. In the case of studies that measured DS: Ugarte-Gil et al. used a brief 5-item version of the CES-D scale,

213

Yan et al. used the full 20-item version, and Ambaw et al. used the PHQ-9 scale. Govender et al. and Theron et al.

214

reported results using the exposure as a numeric variable alone. While Ugarte-Gil et al. and Ambaw et al. used a

215

validated cut-off score for DS compatible with MDE based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

216

Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria, the CES-D version used by Yan et al. was validated with the ICD-10 criteria for

217

mild, moderate and severe depressive disorder. Alternatively, all of the studies on PD utilized the same K-10 scale,

218

but each established different cut-off scores. Naidoo et al. (>30) and Peltzer et al. (>28) used higher cut-off scores

219

compared to Tola et al. (>15). Thus, when pooled together with Ugarte-Gil et al. and Ambaw et al., the results of

220

Tola et al. might have diluted the effect of the meta-analysis by including milder forms of DS.

221
222

Second, in terms of outcomes, the quantification of death and loss to follow-up was uniform across most of the

223

studies reviewed, but there was heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of adherence. For death and loss to

224

follow-up, the majority of the studies synthesized were based on DOTS clinics and used definitions similar to those

225

found in the WHO guidelines for TB treatment.[17] Definitions of adherence were much less standard across the

226

studies, likely due to the fact that the current WHO guidelines do not specifically define non-adherence. For

227

instance, while Yan et al. used the MMAS-8 [21], with scores of eight or higher and lower than six suggesting high

228

and low adherence, respectively, Peltzer et al. and Naidoo et al. measured adherence by asking the participants to

229

estimate their percentage of treatment compliance in the previous three or four week interval, with less than 90%

230

classifying as non-adherence [18]. The latter found no association between PD and treatment adherence, while Yan

231

et al. found a strong association between DS and adherence. The lack of consistency in both the definitions of

232

exposure and outcome may contribute to these seemingly contradictory results. More specifically, Peltzer et al. and

233

Naidoo et al. may have failed to find a significant association because their criteria included individuals with lower

234

severity of non-adherence compared to Yan et al.

236

Third, regarding the evaluation of confounding factors, adjusted ORs were used when available for the analysis. If

237

data on adjusted results for the analysis of negative TB treatment outcomes was not available, as in the case of

238

Ambaw et al. and Peltzer et al., individual adjusted ORs for death and loss to follow-up were used instead. Most

239

studies accounted for socio-demographic variables such as age, sex, and marital status as well as key variables

240

related to both negative outcomes and depression, such as alcohol intake. However, ORs adjusted for other possible

241

confounds such as baseline severity of depression, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status were not provided,

242

leaving prominent factors in the negative TB treatment outcomes unaccounted for.

243
244

Other possible limitations of this meta-analysis include its use of cross-sectional studies and an inability to pool all

245

adjusted ORs. A cross-sectional design is not optimal for establishing causality or providing an appropriate

246

timeframe to study the association between exposure and outcome. These caveats aside, our findings are consistent

247

with the literature on the role of depression on poor treatment outcomes of multiple disorders [22,23]. For example,

248

Mayston et al. found evidence suggesting that DS were related to poor adherence to HIV treatment, while Bowser et

249

al. uncovered a relationship between DS and missing appointments for diabetes mellitus [24,25]. However, the

250

causal relationship between DS and non-adherence, loss to follow-up, and death during TB treatment is likely to be

251

complex. Depressive disorders might impair key neurocognitive functions necessary for proper adherence, such as

252

the appreciation and reasoning components of decision making, memory, and executive function, especially when

253

melancholic symptoms are present. This impairment, in turn, could affect awareness and the disposition to receive

254

TB treatment. Given the evidence that such neurocognitive functions seem to improve with the remission of DS, the

255

need to detect DS during TB treatment is all the more important [26–29].

256
257

The reviewed literature suggests that DS could be a key line of research in the efforts to improve the outcomes of

258

TB treatment. However, in order to properly design and implement an intervention, more preliminary data must

259

identify the most suitable course of action. For example, in order to establish the appropriate period for a timely

260

intervention, we must first better understand how DS evolve during TB treatment and how their variation impacts

261

treatment outcomes. This work calls for the use of universal scales with preset cut-off points to measure depression

262

and facilitate further meta-analysis.

263
264

In addition, measuring the effect of potential mediating factors between DS and negative outcomes of TB treatment

265

might allow us to better identify the most vulnerable populations. For example, depression and substance use

266

disorders, which are themselves associated with both the development of TB and negative outcomes during

267

treatment, also have a high prevalence of comorbidity [30,31]. The pathologic use of drugs such as alcohol and

268

cocaine derivatives have been found to increase the severity of co-occurring depressive symptoms and are likely to

269

severely disrupt cognition, further contributing to poor treatment adherence [32]. Given the multifactorial

270

consequences of mental illness, there is no doubt that a holistic approach to patient care must be considered in order

271

to adequately treat tuberculosis.

272
273

Conclusions

274

The current evidence suggests that depressive symptoms are associated with negative outcomes during the treatment

275

of tuberculosis. We recommend that future research focus on the longitudinal association between depression and

276

TB outcomes, taking into account possible mediators and biological markers that might help to identify subgroups of

277

patients that could benefit from specific interventions, including the treatment of depressive symptoms. Patient

278

management during TB treatment should include depression screening to ensure the quality of care. We also urge

279

that an effort be made to report results for both categorical and continuous depressive measures in order to facilitate

280

more comprehensive meta-analyses.
