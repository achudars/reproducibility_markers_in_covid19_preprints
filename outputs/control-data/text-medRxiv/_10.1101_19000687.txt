SUMMARY BOX
•

The acute effect of exercises on athlete’s electrocardiograms has not been well studied.

•

In our cohort of long-distance triathlon finishers, 28.3% of athletes had abnormal ECGs pre-race
and 16.7% had abnormal ECGs post-race according to the Seattle Criteria. We observed a trend
toward normalization of athlete’s ECGs with acute exercise.

•

Common ECGs abnormalities found in those asymptomatic athletes were left ventricular
hypertrophy, early repolarization and right bundle branch block.

•

Physicians involved in the care of athletes should be prudent when interpreting ECGs in this
population.

ABSTRACT

Objectives
Given the increasing popularity of long-distance triathlon events amongst amateur athlete and the difficulty
for emergency physician to address cardiovascular complaints in the context of exercise, this study aims to:
-

Identify the prevalence of electrocardiographic abnormalities before and after a long distance

triathlon in a cohort of participants using the Seattle criteria.
-

Identify the acute changes that occur on their ECGs at the finish line of a long-distance triathlon.

Methods
This prospective observational study examines the prevalence of selected standard 12-lead ECG findings,
the Seattle criteria, in asymptomatic athletes before and after the completion of a long-distance triathlon.

Results
Of 99 ECGs obtained prior to the race, 28 were abnormal, for a pre-race prevalence of 28.3% (95% CI
(20.4, 37.8)). Of the 72 ECGs post-race, 12 were abnormal, for a post-race prevalence of 16.7% (95% CI
(9.8, 26.9)). We did not observe any athletes with marked repolarization abnormalities.
Common findings were increased QRS voltage significant for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (24 (24.2%)
pre-race, 10 (14.1%) post-race), early repolarization (21 (21.2%) pre-race, 19 (26.8%) post-race) and
incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) (8 (8.1%) pre-race, 11 (15.5%) post-race).
McNemar’s test showed no agreement between the ECG pre and post results (Chi-square =6.54, p = 0.01),
suggesting a possible effect of the race on ECG findings. We observed a trend to normalization of athlete’s
ECGs with acute exercise.

Conclusion
Long-distance endurance exercise might acutely affect the ECGs findings in asymptomatic athletes and
abnormal ECG findings were common in our cohort of athletes. Physicians providing care to long-distance
athletes should interpret ECGs in this population prudently.

INTRODUCTION
The popularity of high-volume endurance athletic events surged in the last 30 years. Marathons, triathlons
of all distances and obstacle courses attract an increasing number of participants every year.[1, 2] Amateur
athletes are engaging in regular endurance training [2] and a proportion of these participants, with a mean
age of 40 to 50 years old, have predisposing risk factors and may have a cardiac event during training or
racing.[3]
The physiologic adaptation of the heart in athletes (“athlete’s heart”) [4] and risk factors for sudden cardiac
death (SCD) during exercise are reported in the literature. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) first
established criteria for pre-participation screening electrocardiograms (ECG) in athletes.[5] To improve the
specificity of these criteria and avoid false-positive results, the Seattle criteria were developed and are used
for screening in athletes (see Table 1). [6-10] More recently, these criteria are refined to high-risk ECG
findings, warranting more investigations, and low-risk findings, which, if found alone, most likely represent
physiological response of the heart to exercise.[11] Attempts to correlate ECG changes to
echocardiographic findings show limited predictive value of ECGs to reveal underlying cardiac
abnormalities.[2, 12, 13]

However, the focus has been on long-term changes of the athlete’s heart and there is a paucity of literature
describing acute changes in athletes’ ECGs after endurance events. Evaluation of cardiac complaints in
athletes is a challenge for physicians in the acute setting because interpretation of the ECG should be made
in the context of exercise, but no specific criteria exist to differentiate benign normal variations secondary to
exercise versus pathological changes. [3, 14, 15] Thus, athletes are prone to undergo unnecessary

investigations [14] or might receive inappropriate reassurance or discharge when they present to an
emergency setting with cardiac related complaints.

OBJECTIVES
Given the increasing popularity of long-distance triathlon events amongst amateur athlete and the difficulty
for emergency physicians to address cardiovascular complaints in the context of exercise, this study aims
to:
-

Identify the prevalence of electrocardiographic abnormalities before and after a long distance triathlon
in a cohort of participants using the Seattle criteria.

-

Identify the acute changes that occur on their ECGs at the finish line of a long-distance triathlon.

METHODOLOGY
This prospective observational study of a convenience sample of participants in a long-distance triathlon
(1.8 km swim, 90 km bike and 21.1 km run) was designed to examine prevalence of selected ECG findings,
commonly accepted as the standard to identify training-related ECG changes (the Seattle criteria) [6] and
changes that may occur acutely following an endurance event. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of McGill. It was conducted June 26th 2016 in Mont-Tremblant Quebec.

Participants and participants involvement
A group of triathletes were consulted informally during the study design to assess the feasibility of the study
and their willingness to participate in such an experiment. At race registration, held two and three days prior
to the event, Canadian athletes older than 18 years were informed of the purpose of the study and asked
to participate. Volunteers satisfying these inclusion criteria were enrolled and, after informed consent, given
a study number and completed a questionnaire detailing demographic variables (c.f. Supplementary
Material 1).
Participants with a history of acute coronary syndrome, pacemaker or defibrillator, use of medications that
may affect ECG or echocardiographic findings, and women currently pregnant or who were pregnant in the
last 12 weeks were excluded. Participants experiencing chest pain or syncope during or after the event were
to be directed to the medical tent for evaluation and treatment and excluded from final analysis. [16, 17]

Data collection
Physicians and paramedic students were trained to obtain 12-lead ECGs from participants in conformity
with the American Heart Association (AHA) standards of quality.[18] ECGs were acquired on each
participant at rest during study enrollment and again at the finish line with Philips HeartStart MRx
monitor/defibrillator. Athletes were tracked electronically by bib number and, at the finish line, a member of
the research team confirmed voluntary consent and bought participants to a designated area, close to the
medical tent. The post-event ECG was performed within 15 minutes [2] of completion of the race in the
same conditions as the pre-race ECGs. Technical quality and brief screening of ECGs for high-risk findings
was done on-site by an emergency physician and EM resident (B and H-D). Participants were informed of
their ECG results at the time of acquisition. Appropriate follow-up of concerning ECG findings was ensured
by medical personnel on site (Supplementary Material 2). ECGs were stored in an electronic format (12lead and rhythm strip) and identified by participant study number. Confidentiality of participant’s information
was ensured by the research team.

Data analysis
ECG results were stripped of all identification data in order for reviewers to be blinded to subjects’
demographics and acquisition time. Two emergency physicians and a cardiology fellow reviewed each ECG
result independently and evaluated each Seattle criterion as either present or absent. For each criterion,
the final evaluation retained was the one made by at least two of three reviewers.
Following interpretation, the ECGs were categorized as normal (≤1 Seattle Criteria C1-C10 present) or
abnormal (2 or more Seattle Criteria C1-C10 present and/or any of the Seattle Criteria C11-C26 present).
[7,8]
Demographic characteristics of participants are reported as counts and percentages for categorical
variables and as mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.
The prevalence of abnormal ECG findings pre and post-race were estimated and reported with a 95%
confidence interval (CI).[19]
Differences in demographic characteristics between those who presented changes in ECG findings between
pre-race and post-race were investigated with Fisher’s exact test (FET) for categorical variables and t-test
for continuous variables.

In order to investigate a possible effect of exercise on the presence of ECG findings, we performed a
McNemar’s test to compare differences in proportions between normal and abnormal changes in ECG
findings between pre-race and post-race evaluations.

RESULTS

Participants
103 adult volunteers meet the inclusion criteria and were recruited in the study. 99 had baseline ECGs and
demographic data collected at race registration. Seven participants had concerning findings identified on
their pre-race ECGs (Supplementary Material 3). Of these, none had significant past medical history of
cardiovascular disease or were on any medications. Two had previous cardiac investigation including
normal echocardiogram, one was referred to cardiology and had a normal echocardiogram prior to the race.
The athletes were given explanations about the nature of the findings and risks of participation, and signed
waivers to compete in the race. All participants chose to compete in the event, were asymptomatic and did
not require medical assistance. Appropriate follow-up was arranged.
72 participants had ECGs done following completion of their race. Seven participants did not finish the race
(c.f. Figure 1 - Flow chart), none for cardiac related reasons. 20 participants did not volunteer to present for
the post-race ECG, none required medical attention. Demographic characteristics are detailed in table 2.

Descriptive ECG findings
Of the 99 ECGs obtained pre-race, 28 (28.3%, 95% CI (20.4, 37.8)) were considered “abnormal” as defined
by the Seattle criteria (with “normal” defined as no abnormalities or 1 low-risk abnormality identified). 36
(36.4%) had no Seattle criteria present. Seven (7.1%) ECGs were identified as “high-risk” by our reviewers.
Details about those ECGs are available in supplementary material 3.
72 athletes presented for post-race ECGs. Of those, 48 (66.7%) had normal ECGs pre-race (≤ 1 Seattle
Criteria C1-C10), including 25 (34.7%) with no Seattle criteria (C1-C26) present. Of the 24 (23.6%)
abnormal, five (6.9%) had at least one high-risk finding present (C11-c26). The other abnormal pre-race
ECGs were considered as such because of the presence of more than 1 low-risk feature, most commonly
sinus bradycardia with benign early repolarization (n=4), left ventricular hypertrophy (n=5) or both (n=3).
Of the 72 ECGs post-race, 12 were abnormal (16.7%, 95% CI (9.8, 26.9)). In the 60 (83.3%) normal ECGs,
34 (47.2%) had no Seattle criteria (C1-C26) present. Five ECGs were interpreted as high risk, including two
with persistence of pre-race findings, one with resolution of one finding and appearance of a long QT, and
two participants had new ECG abnormalities. The prevalence for each individual Seattle Criteria is available
in table 3.

ECG changes during the event
Table 4 shows a cross-classification of ECG results classified as Normal/Abnormal pre and post-race. There
were 43 (59.7%) ECGs classified as Normal pre-race which remained Normal at post-race. ECG results did
not coincide for 22 participants. As shown in table 4, 5 (6.9%) participants with normal ECG pre-race had
abnormal ECG post-race ECGs and 17 (23.6%) participants with abnormal pre-race ECG had normal postrace ECG. McNemar’s test shows no agreement between the ECG pre and post results (Chi-square = 6.54,
p = 0.01), suggesting a possible effect of the race on ECG findings.

Table 5 compares participant demographics with and without ECG changes pre-race to post-race. Men
tended to have more ECG finding change from pre-race to post-race than women, but this difference was
not statistically significant (FET, p = 0.07). Years of training and past participation did not seem to affect
ECG pre- to post-race. Increased number of hours of training per week seemed to favor change in ECG
from pre to post-race.

34 (34.3%) of participants had sinus bradycardia pre-race. Of those, the bradycardia resolved in 24 of the
26 who presented for post-race ECGs. Eleven of the participants with sinus bradycardia pre-race did not
have any other Seattle criteria present. However, other criteria were present post-race in 5 of those
participants (sinus arrhythmia (1), incomplete RBBB (2), benign early repolarization (1) and isolated left
ventricular hypertrophy (1)). Resolution of sinus bradycardia explained the conversion to “normal” ECGs in
only 3 participants. Other common findings were increased QRS voltage significant for left ventricular

19 (26.8%) post-race) and incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) (8 (8.1 %) pre-race, 11 (15.5%)
post-race).

DISCUSSION
With increasing popularity of endurance events in the general population, more athletes may present to
medical tents and emergency rooms (ED) with conditions such as chest pain, shortness of breath and
syncope for which an ECG is a standard investigation. Physicians interpreting the ECG must determine if
abnormalities are representative of athletic conditioning or a manifestation of an acute medical presentation.
This may lead to either over or under investigation of the athlete. Minns et al [15] described two runners
who presented to the ED with ECGs with a similar ischemic pattern consistent with acute myocardial
infarction. Both underwent cardiac catheterization, one had a significant stenosis requiring stenting, the
other had normal coronary arteries. This underscores the importance of careful history, physical exam,
diagnostic testing including ECG and prudent use of invasive testing.

Main findings
This observational study is one of the first looking at the acute effect of endurance activity on the ECG
findings in a healthy asymptomatic athlete population. In a cohort of 99 athletes, 71.7% of ECGs pre-race
were normal (≤ 1 Seattle Criteria C1-C10), including 36 (36.4%) with no Seattle criteria (C1-C26) present.
Minns et al [2] reported similar findings: 27 of 87 (31%) athletes in their cohort had normal ECGs with no
Seattle criteria present. The rest of the ECGs in their athlete population were considered clinically
insignificant. We found 29 (29.2%) with the presence of more than 1 low-risk feature, most commonly sinus
bradycardia (n=32), benign early repolarization (n=21), left ventricular hypertrophy (n=25) or both (n=9).
Unlike the cohort reported by Minns et al.,[2] 5 (6.9%) athletes in our population had ECGs considered highrisk before the event. All were asymptomatic and had normal cardiac evaluations. Pelliccia et al.[20]
examined a database of 12,550 trained athletes, and identified 81 with marked repolarization abnormalities
and no apparent cardiac disease. Of the 81 athletes with abnormal ECGs, 5 (6%) ultimately proved to have
cardiomyopathies. In comparison, 229 matched control athletes with normal ECGs from the same database
did not develop cardiac disease or significant adverse events. They suggested abnormal ECGs in young
and apparently healthy athletes may represent the initial expression of underlying cardiomyopathies and

these athletes merit continued clinical surveillance.

We did not observe any athletes with marked

repolarization abnormalities in our cohort.

Abnormal ECGs
We observed 28 (28.3%) of subjects with pre-event ECG findings considered abnormal as per the standards
at the time.[6] With the recent consensus statement published in 2017 [21], the two subjects with isolated
left axis deviation would not have been considered high risk and would not have required further
investigation. No subjects developed concerning symptoms during training or racing consistent with prior
studies suggesting a low predictive value of ECGs for cardiac abnormalities in athletes.[3] Interestingly, after
exercise, more athletes had what is considered a “normal” ECG (83,3 %). This suggests an effect of exercise
on the post-event ECGs. This “normalization” of ECGs during exercise was also observed by Minn et al.[2]
In our cohort, 17 subjects out of 72 with post-event ECGs had resolution of abnormal findings acutely after
the endurance event. Post-event development of incomplete RBBBB was the most represented ECG
change in this study. Development of long QT in 3 subjects was concerning and necessitated referral to
cardiologists for further work-up. In these athletes, the corrected QT (QTc) was less than 500ms. Corrado
et al [22] reported a 0.7% prevalence of long QT during their late screening period. Basavarajaiah et al.
[23] investigated 2000 elite British athletes in 15 different sports for the prevalence and significance of an
isolated long QT interval. They indicated the significance of an isolated prolonged QTc interval of <500 ms
in athletes remains unknown but represents a low probability of long QT syndrome or a benign group in
whom close monitoring rather than disqualification may be more appropriate in the absence a genetic
diagnosis. Their research did not include the development of a long QT with exercise in athletes with
previously normal QT intervals. More research in this area is indicated.
Our findings suggest participation in a long-distance aerobic event can acutely alter the ECG of
asymptomatic athletes. With the growing popularity of endurance events, physicians may see an increase
in athletes presenting to the Emergency room with symptoms warranting an ECG. It will be necessary for
these physicians to interpret the findings taking into consideration the baseline ECG of the athlete and
changes that may occur acutely related to event participation.

The strengths of our study are the use of a standardized approach to electrocardiograms acquisition and
interpretation, using the AHA standards of acquisition. We were able to confirm with the on-site medical
team that no participants presented for medical assessment.
Three reviewers blindly analyzed the ECG using the Seattle criteria, limiting bias. Our cohort is
representative of high-volume athletic events as the participants were of different ages, sex and athletic
performance levels.
However, our study was limited by the size of our cohort. Due to ethical and logistical limitations, we could
not perform ECGs in symptomatic athletes: we would have needed to perform pre-race ECGs on a very
large number of athletes to be able to contrast them to the few athletes who had cardiovascular related
complaints at the finish line and this could have interfered with the provision of medical care.

Application in the clinical setting
Emergency providers involved in the care of athletes during high-volume athletic events are challenged to
interpret an athlete’s ECG and accurately differentiate findings suggestive of a potentially serious
cardiovascular disorder from benign physiological adaptations occurring as the result of regular, endurance
training.[21] ECGs are often performed on-site for participants who seek medical assistance for
cardiovascular complaints such as syncope, dizziness, chest pain or palpitations, all of those complaints
having multiple possible causes to explain them, cardiomyopathies, cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias being
responsible for a small but relevant proportion.[22] Providers should be aware that high-volume exercise
seems to affect ECGs and careful interpretation of ECGs obtained during athletic events is advised.
To further investigate the significance of ECG abnormalities in athletes, correlation to echocardiograms
performed pre and post-race in this population might be of value. Also, obtaining ECGs in a symptomatic
cohort of athletes with comparison to the baseline ECG would help interpret the significance of the findings.
A larger scale study would confirm replication of these results.
CONCLUSION
Long-distance endurance exercise might acutely affect the ECGs findings in asymptomatic athletes. We
identified a high-prevalence of abnormalities in our cohort before exercise. Identifying physiologic
electrocardiographic changes in athletes after completion of a high-intensity endurance event could help
define new clinical guidelines for evaluation of cardiac complaints in athletes, since a significant proportion

of them seem to have abnormalities on their baseline ECGs. Physicians providing care to long-distance
athletes should interpret ECGs in this population prudently.
