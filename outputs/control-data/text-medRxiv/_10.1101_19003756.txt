Abstract
Objective: To examine the association of health literacy and cognitive ability with risk of
diabetes.
Research Design and Methods: Participants were 8,669 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
participants (mean age 66.7 years, SD 9.7) who completed health literacy and cognitive ability
tests at wave 2 (2004-2005), and who answered a self-reported question on whether a doctor
had ever diagnosed them with diabetes. Logistic regression was used to examine the crosssectional associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with diabetes status. In those
without diabetes at wave 2, Cox regression was used to test the associations of health literacy
and cognitive ability with risk of diabetes over a median of 9.5 years follow-up (n=6,961).
Results: Adequate (compared to limited) health literacy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.84) and
higher cognitive ability (OR per 1 SD 0.73, CI 0.67-0.80) were both associated with lower
odds of self-reported diabetes. Adequate health literacy (HR 0.64; CI 0.53-0.77) and higher
cognitive ability (HR 0.77, CI 0.69-0.85) were also associated with lower risk of self-reporting
diabetes during follow-up. When both health literacy and cognitive ability were added to the
same model, these associations were slightly attenuated. Additional adjustment for health
behaviours, education and social class attenuated associations further, and neither health
literacy nor cognitive ability were significantly associated with diabetes.
Conclusions: Adequate health literacy and better cognitive ability were associated with reduced
risk of diabetes. These associations were independent of each other, but not of other healthand socioeconomic-related variables.

Diabetes is a common chronic condition in older adulthood and is associated with substantial
morbidity and mortality (1). Type 2 diabetes, the most common type of diabetes, is at least
partly preventable (2). Understanding the characteristics of those most at risk of developing
diabetes is important to appropriately target diabetes education and interventions. Known risk
factors for developing diabetes include older age, deprivation, and obesity (1, 2).
Lower cognitive ability may be a risk factor for diabetes. Whereas one study (3) found that
childhood cognitive ability did not predict diabetes in midlife, others have found that lower
cognitive ability in early life was associated with higher risk of diabetes in adulthood (4, 5). In
a sample of Scottish older adults who had their cognitive ability tested in childhood (4), a 1 SD
advantage in cognitive ability was associated with 26% lower odds of reporting diabetes in
older age. Individuals with higher cognitive ability might have the cognitive skills required to
self-manage their health, take better care of themselves throughout life, and thus reduce the risk
of developing diabetes (4, 6).
Health literacy, of which cognitive ability is thought to be a prerequisite (7), might also play a
role in diabetes risk. Health literacy is the “capacity to obtain, process and understand basic
health information and services needed to make basic health decisions” (8). In cross-sectional
studies, rates of diabetes are higher in those with low health literacy (9, 10). In one study,
participants with inadequate health literacy were 48% more likely to report having diabetes
when compared to participants with adequate health literacy, even after adjusting for
sociodemographic and health variables (10). Individuals with lower health literacy might not
have the health-related skills required to obtain, understand and follow health advice, such as
eating well and exercising, which might reduce the risk of diabetes (8).
In individuals with diabetes, higher health literacy has consistently been associated with greater
diabetes knowledge (11-13). A very small association between higher health literacy and lower

HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes has also been reported in a meta-analysis based on 26
studies (r=-0.048, p=0.027) (12). Whereas studies have investigated the association between
health literacy and disease management in people with diabetes, little is known about whether
health literacy is associated with risk of developing diabetes.
Health literacy and cognitive ability test scores are positively correlated (14, 15). In one study,
rank-order correlations between a measure of general cognitive ability and three health literacy
tests ranged from 0.37 to 0.50 (15). These correlations with cognitive ability tended to be
higher than the correlations between the three health literacy tests themselves (rho = 0.28 to
0.46) (15). Researchers have sought to determine the role of cognitive ability in the association
between health literacy and a range of health outcomes. Most (but not all (16)) studies have
found that cognitive ability partly or entirely attenuates the association between health literacy
and health (17-20). It is possible that any association between health literacy and diabetes may
be attenuated when also measuring cognitive ability.
The aim of the current study was to better understand the associations of health literacy and
cognitive ability with risk of diabetes. Using participants from the English Longitudinal Study
of Ageing (ELSA), a cohort study designed to be representative of adults aged over 50 years
living in England (21), the present study investigated whether health literacy and cognitive
ability were independently associated with self-reported diabetes status. First, the crosssectional associations between health literacy, cognitive ability, and self-reported diabetes were
investigated. Second, individuals without diabetes at baseline were followed-up for up to 10
years to determine whether health literacy and cognitive ability were independently associated
with subsequent risk of diabetes in mid-to-later life.

This study used data from core members of the ELSA study, a prospective cohort study of
community-dwelling adults residing in England. The wave 1 (2002-2003) sample consisted of
11,391 participants who had previously participated in the Health Survey for England and who
were living in a private household (21). ELSA participants have been followed up every two
years.
The main interview consisted of participants answering questions on health, lifestyle and
economic circumstances via a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI). Participants were
asked to complete a self-completion questionnaire which assessed topics including diet and
alcohol consumption. A nurse visit was carried out every second wave to assess physical
measurements including height and weight, and blood and saliva samples were taken to
measure biomarkers of disease. A detailed description of the sample design and the data
collected in ELSA is reported elsewhere (21). The present study used data from waves 2 to 7.
For the present study, baseline was considered to be Wave 2 (2004-2005; n=8,726), which was
when the health literacy assessment was introduced.
Ethical approval for the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing was obtained from the National
Research and Ethics Committee.
Diabetes
Two measures of diabetes, collected during the CAPI, were used as outcome variables in this
study.
Baseline diabetes status: Individuals who answered “yes” to “Has a doctor ever told you that
you have diabetes?” at wave 2 were categorised as having diabetes. This question did not
differentiate which type of diabetes the participant was diagnosed with. A previous study
reported a high rate of agreement between self-reported diabetes and fasting blood glucose in a

subsample of ELSA participants with data on both self-reported diabetes status and fasting
blood glucose levels (22).
Incident diabetes: For incident diabetes, the analysis was restricted to participants who did not
self-report diabetes at wave 2 and who had at least one wave of follow-up between waves 3 and
7. Participants who did not self-report diabetes at wave 2 and who subsequently answered
“yes” to “Has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes?” were categorised as having
incident diabetes. As all participants were aged over 50 years at diagnosis, these cases are
probably cases of type 2 diabetes.
Date of diabetes diagnosis: Individuals who self-reported diabetes were asked which month
and year they were diagnosed. Date of diabetes diagnosis was used to calculate the time
between wave 2 assessment and diabetes diagnosis.
Health literacy
A brief 4-item health literacy test was administered during the CAPI at wave 2. This test
assessed health-related reading comprehension skills which are thought to be required to
successfully understand written health materials commonly encountered in healthcare.
Participants were presented with a piece of paper containing a label for a packet of over-thecounter medication. Participants were asked four questions about the information on this label
(e.g., “what is the maximum number of days you may take this medicine?”). The score was the
number of correctly answered questions. As has been done in other studies (23, 24),
performance was categorised as adequate (4/4 correct) or limited (<4 correct).
Cognitive ability
Four tests administered during the wave 2 CAPI were used to create a measure of general
cognitive ability. Immediate and delayed word recall were used to assess verbal declarative
memory. In the immediate recall test, participants were read a list of 10 words and were asked

to immediately recall as many of the words as possible. The score was the number of words
recalled immediately. After a short delay, in which the words were not repeated, participants
were asked to remember the 10 words again. The score was the number of words recalled after
a delay. Executive function was assessed with a verbal fluency test. Participants were
instructed to name as many animals as possible. The score was the number of animals named
within the 60 second time limit. Letter cancellation was used to assess processing speed.
Participants were presented with a piece of paper containing letters of the alphabet arranged in
rows and columns. The task was to scan the piece of paper and score out all Ps and Ws. The
score was the combined number of Ps and Ws scored out in 60 seconds.
Scores of 0 on animal fluency (n=48) and letter cancellation (n=3) were removed as this
suggests participants did not complete the task or did not understand the task. Scores of 50 or
more on animal fluency (n=4), and 60 or more on the letter cancellation (n=3) were removed as
these scores were questionably high given the test time limits. Scores on the four cognitive
ability tests were then entered into a principal component analysis (PCA). Only the first
component had an eigenvalue >1, and the scree plot also indicated one component. Scores from
the first principal component were saved and used as a measure of cognitive ability. The first
component accounted for 57% of the variance in the scores on the four cognitive tests. The
loadings were: Immediate word recall=0.83, delayed word recall=0.85, animal fluency=0.72,
and letter cancellation=0.58. The resultant cognitive ability score was a z-score (mean 0.00, SD
1.00).
Covariates
Age (in years), sex, BMI, health behaviours, number of cardiovascular comorbidities, and
measures of socioeconomic status were used as covariates. Unless otherwise stated, all
covariates were self-reported at the wave 2 CAPI. Participants aged over 90 years had their age

set to 90 as there were so few of them. Participants were asked whether they smoked cigarettes
nowadays and were categorised as current smokers or non-smokers. Participants were asked
how often they took part in moderate and vigorous physical activity (more than once a week,
once a week, one to three times a month, and hardly ever/never). Physical activity levels were
categorised as vigorous activity at least once per week, moderate activity at least once per
week, and physically inactive. Participants were asked about their frequency of alcohol
consumption in the past 12 months in the self-completion questionnaire. This was categorised
as never, rarely, at least once a month, at least once a week, and daily/almost daily. Height and
weight, measured during the wave 2 nurse interview, were used to calculate BMI (kg/m2).
Cardiovascular comorbidities were assessed by counting the number of self-reported
cardiovascular conditions from hypertension, angina, heart attack, heart murmur, abnormal
heart rhythm, stroke, and high cholesterol. Age that participants left full-time education was
categorised as: age 14 or under, 15-16 years, 17-18 years, and age 19 or older. Social class was
categorised using the National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification 3 categories (25):
managerial and professional, intermediate, and routine and manual.
Analysis
Independent t-tests were used to compare those with and without diabetes at wave 2 and those
who did and did not develop diabetes at follow-up on normally-distributed continuous
variables. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for non-normal continuous variables, and X2 tests
were used for categorical variables. Spearman rank-order correlations were calculated between
all predictor variables and co-variables.
Binary logistic regression was used to test the cross-sectional association of health literacy and
cognitive ability with wave 2 diabetes status. Cox regression was used to investigate whether
health literacy and cognitive ability test scores at wave 2 predicted risk of developing diabetes

between waves 2 and 7. In the Cox regression analysis, time-to-event was taken as the
difference, in days, between date of wave 2 CAPI and date of diabetes diagnosis for those who
self-reported diabetes. For all other participants, time-to-event was the difference between date
of wave 2 CAPI interview and the date of last CAPI interview. Month and year, but not day,
were recorded for date of CAPI interview and date of diabetes diagnosis. To create a date
variable (yyyy.mm.dd), the day was set to the middle of the month.
For the logistic regression and Cox regression, 6 models were run. Age and sex were entered
into all models. Health literacy and cognitive ability were entered individually in models 1 and
2, respectively. Both health literacy and cognitive ability were added in Model 3 to determine
whether the size of the health literacy-diabetes and cognitive ability-diabetes associations
changed when concurrently entering both these variables in the model. To assess whether BMI
and health behaviours accounted for these associations, BMI, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, and physical activity were added in Model 4. Diabetes is a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (26). Associations between poorer cognitive ability and cardiovascular
disease are also well established (27, 28). It is possible that any association between health
literacy and cognitive ability with diabetes may be because of these associations with
cardiovascular disease. To determine whether any association between health literacy and
cognitive ability with diabetes was attenuated when adjusting for cardiovascular disease,
number of cardiovascular comorbidities was additionally added in Model 5. Age of leaving
full-time education and occupational social class were added in Model 6 to determine whether
the association between health literacy, cognitive ability and diabetes was attenuated when
accounting for these commonly-used indicators of socioeconomic status.
This study was interested in the associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with selfreported diabetes and the independence of these associations with respect to other health and
socioeconomic-related variables. In the main text we report the ORs (95% CIs) and the HRs

(95% CIs) for health literacy and cognitive ability only. The estimates for all covariates entered
into the models are reported in the Supplementary materials.
RESULTS
Of the 8,726 ELSA participants who completed the wave 2 assessment, 3 participants were
removed who answered “don’t know” to whether a doctor had diagnosed them with diabetes. A
further 54 were removed because these individuals selected that they had “diabetes or high
blood sugar” from a Showcard listing cardiovascular conditions, but, when asked whether a
doctor had ever told them they had diabetes, they answered “no”. Thus, the analytic sample
consisted of 8,669 participants. Participant characteristics are reported in Table 1.
Baseline diabetes status
At baseline 708 (8.2%) of participants self-reported a doctor diagnosis of diabetes. Compared
to those without diabetes, those with diabetes were more likely to have limited health literacy
(42.2% versus 32.3%; p<.001) and have lower cognitive ability scores (diabetes mean -0.36,
SD 0.97; no diabetes mean 0.03, SD 1.00; Cohen’s d 0.40; p<.001). Compared to participants
without diabetes, participants with diabetes at wave 2 were older, more likely to be male,
tended to leave full-time education at a younger age, be from a less professional social class,
have a higher BMI, consume less alcohol, be inactive, and self-report more cardiovascular
comorbidities. Rank-order correlations between the predictor variables and co-variables are
reported in Table 2. Adequate health literacy was moderately correlated with higher scores on
cognitive ability (rho=0.31, p<.001).
The ORs and 95% CIs for the associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with selfreported diabetes at wave 2 are reported in Table 3 (full results are reported in Supplementary
Table S1). A Box-Tidwell test found that the assumption of linearity of the logit was violated.
Therefore an age-squared term was included in all models, and a squared term for number of

cardiovascular comorbidities was included in models 5 and 6. Individuals with adequate health
literacy were 28% less likely to self-report diabetes at wave 2 (Model 1; OR 0.72, 95% CI
0.61-0.84). A 1 SD higher cognitive ability was associated with a 27% lower odds of selfreporting diabetes (Model 2; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67-0.80). The association between health
literacy and diabetes was attenuated by 36% (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98) and the association
between cognitive ability and diabetes was attenuated by 19% (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.86)
when entering both health literacy and cognitive ability in Model 3. Both remained
significantly associated with diabetes. The association between health literacy and cognitive
ability with diabetes was attenuated and no longer significant when additionally adjusting for
BMI and health behaviours in Model 4. Health literacy and cognitive ability remained nonsignificant after adjustment for cardiovascular comorbidities (Model 5), and for education and
social class (Model 6).
In the fully-adjusted model (Model 6; Supplementary Table S1) older age, being male, having
a higher BMI, and reporting a higher number of cardiovascular comorbidities were associated
with higher odds of having diabetes at wave 2. The association between number of
cardiovascular comorbidities and diabetes became less strong as the number of comorbidities
increased. Those who reported drinking alcohol at least once per month, rarely, or who never
drank alcohol in the last 12 months were more likely to self-report diabetes when compared to
those who reported drinking daily/almost daily. Compared to those who reported being
physically inactive, those who took part in moderate or vigorous physical activity at least once
per week were less likely to self-report diabetes.
Risk of incident diabetes
Of the 7,961 participants who did not self-report diabetes at wave 2, 6,961 participants had at
least one wave of follow-up between waves 3 and 7. They form the analytic sample for the

association between health literacy, cognitive ability and risk of incident diabetes. A total of
506 (7.3%) participants reported a new diagnosis of diabetes between wave 3 and wave 7,
whereas 6,455 (92.7%) participants did not. Median time to follow-up was 9.5 years. Mean
time to censor for those with diabetes, who were censored at date of diabetes diagnosis, was
4.7 years (SD 3.1). Mean time to censor for those not diagnosed with diabetes, who were
censored at date of last CAPI interview, was 7.8 years (SD 2.9). Characteristics for participants
with and without diabetes at follow-up are shown in Table 1. Compared to participants who did
not have incident diabetes, those who did were more likely to have limited health literacy
(38.8% versus 30.3%, p<.001) and had lower cognitive ability scores (diabetes mean -0.04, SD
0.89; no diabetes mean 0.10, SD 0.98, Cohen’s d 0.15, p<.001) at wave 2. Compared to those
who did not develop diabetes, participants who developed diabetes were older, more likely to
be male, have left full-time education at a younger age, be from a less professional social class,
smoke, consume less alcohol, be inactive, and to report more cardiovascular comorbidities at
wave 2.
The HRs and 95% CIs for the association between health literacy, cognitive ability and risk of
diabetes are reported in Table 4 (full results reported in Supplementary Table S2). Adequate
health literacy at wave 2 was associated with a 36% lower risk of developing diabetes (Model
1; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.77). A 1 SD higher cognitive ability score at wave 2 was associated
with a 23% lower risk of developing diabetes (Model 2; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.85). The
association between health literacy and risk of diabetes was attenuated by 22% after adjustment
for cognitive ability (Model 3; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.87), and the association between
cognitive ability and risk of diabetes was attenuated by 9% after adjusting for health literacy
(HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88). Both health literacy and cognitive ability remained significant
predictors of diabetes risk. BMI and health behaviours were additionally added to the model in
Model 4. The associations of health literacy (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.99) and cognitive ability

(HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.96) with diabetes risk were further attenuated but remained
statistically significant. When additionally adjusting for number of cardiovascular
comorbidities, the association between health literacy and cognitive ability with risk of
diabetes remained almost unchanged (Model 5). After adjustment for age at leaving full-time
education and social class, the associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with risk of
diabetes were further attenuated and non-significant.
In the fully-adjusted model (Model 6; Supplementary Table S2) male participants, those with a
higher BMI, current smokers, and those who reported consuming alcohol rarely (compared to
those who reported consuming alcohol daily/almost daily) at wave 2 had an increased risk of
diabetes. Participants who reported leaving education at age 19 years or older had a lower risk
of diabetes when compared to those who left education at age 14 years or younger.
Sensitivity analysis
There were some missing data. For the cross-sectional analyses, 70% of participants had
complete data. For the longitudinal analyses, 75% of participants had complete data. All
models were re-run using only participants with complete data on all variables entered into the
models. These results are reported in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. The pattern of
associations were generally similar; however, the sizes of the associations tended to be slightly
weaker compared to the full sample. For the cross-sectional analysis, health literacy was no
longer significantly associated with diabetes status in Model 3 when adjusting for health
literacy and cognitive ability (Supplementary Table S3). For the longitudinal analysis, when
adjusting for BMI and health behaviours (Model 4; Supplementary Table S4), health literacy
was no longer associated with risk of diabetes.

Using a sample of middle-aged and older adults living in England, the present study found that
adequate health literacy and better cognitive ability were associated with lower odds of
reporting diabetes. The associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with diabetes status
were attenuated and non-significant when additionally adjusting for BMI and health
behaviours. Adequate health literacy and better cognitive ability, measured at wave 2, were
associated with reduced risk of developing diabetes during a median of 9.5 years follow-up.
Health literacy and cognitive ability predicted risk of diabetes both when examined
individually and when examined concurrently. These associations were attenuated, though
remained significant, when adjusting for BMI and health behaviours. When additionally
adjusting for education and social class, the associations between health literacy and cognitive
ability with diabetes risk were no longer significant. The results of the current study suggest
that health literacy and cognitive ability have overlapping and unique associations with risk of
diabetes. However, the relationship of health literacy and cognitive ability with diabetes is
attenuated by health behaviours and education.
Previous cross-sectional studies have found that individuals with lower health literacy are more
likely to report having diabetes (9, 10) and longitudinal studies have found that that lower
cognitive ability earlier in life is associated with an increased risk of diabetes (4, 5). The
present study is the first longitudinal study to examine whether health literacy is associated
with risk of developing diabetes, and the first to examine whether cognitive ability and health
literacy have independent associations with diabetes.
The association between health literacy and cognitive ability can at times be so strong that
some have suggested that health literacy and cognitive ability are not unique constructs and,
instead, that health literacy variance is mostly overlapping with cognitive ability (19; 29). If
this were true, one would expect the association between health literacy and diabetes to be fully
attenuated when adjusting for cognitive ability. This is not what was found in the current study.

The association between health literacy and diabetes was only moderately attenuated (by 36%
for baseline diabetes status and by 22% for diabetes risk) when adjusting for cognitive ability;
moreover, both remained significant predictors of diabetes. The results suggest that only some
of the association of health literacy and diabetes status with diabetes risk was accounted for by
cognitive ability.
However, there is a necessary caveat to that possible conclusion. The cognitive ability measure
created in the current study used four brief cognitive ability tests that assessed memory,
executive function and processing speed, and did not include other important domains of
cognitive function, such as reasoning, that are known to load highly on general cognitive
ability (30). It is possible that some of the unique contribution of health literacy might be
residual cognitive capability that was not picked up by the relatively brief measures of
cognitive ability used (31). It is also not appropriate to compare the strength of the health
literacy-diabetes and cognitive ability-diabetes associations due to the differences in
measurement. Cognitive ability was assessed using a continuous measure created using scores
on multiple cognitive ability tests, whereas health literacy scores were dichotomised into two
groups (adequate and limited health literacy) based on performance on a brief, four-item test.
We found that the associations between health literacy and cognitive ability with crosssectional diabetes status and with risk of diabetes were fully and partly attenuated, respectively,
when adjusting for BMI and health behaviours. Better cognitive ability has been associated
with health promoting behaviours such as following a healthy diet and taking part in regular
exercise (3, 32-34). Whereas some studies have found associations between better health
literacy and taking part in health promoting behaviours (35), others have not (36). Individuals
with higher health literacy and cognitive ability might tend to be better equipped with the skills
and abilities needed to take better care of themselves (6, 37) and to follow health advise

including eating well and exercising, which, in turn, reduces the risk of developing diabetes
(2).
Education attenuated and nullified the association between health literacy and cognitive ability
with risk of diabetes. The association between better health literacy and cognitive ability with
higher levels of education are well established (8, 38). Education may lead to better cognitive
ability and health literacy, which in turn may lead to better health-related skills and lower rates
of diabetes (19). Higher early life cognitive ability has been found to predict later educational
attainment (38). Therefore, an alternative, but not mutually exclusive, explanation could be
that higher cognitive ability may equip an individual with the skills needed to obtain higher
educational qualifications. Higher educational attainment, in turn, may lead to better health
(and lower risk of diabetes) by, for example, increasing health-related knowledge and decisionmaking skills (19). It is possible that including education in the models could be overadjusting.
This study has a number of strengths and limitations. A key strength is that it examined the
association of health literacy, cognitive ability and risk of incident diabetes longitudinally.
Another strength is the relatively large sample size. One limitation is that only a subsample of
participants had complete data. Those with missing data may be those with the lowest health
literacy and cognitive ability scores. ELSA may also suffer from selective attrition such that
those with increased risk of diabetes may be less likely to return for follow-up. Therefore, the
results reported here may not generalise to those with the lowest health literacy and/or
cognitive ability, and those with the highest risk of diabetes. Diabetes status was self-reported.
However, there is a relatively high rate of agreement between self-reported diabetes and fasting
blood glucose in ELSA (22). Only 1.7% of ELSA participants had undiagnosed diabetes,
which is much lower than has been found in other cohort studies (22). The health literacy test
used in the current study was a brief, four-item test which had limited variance (67% of

participants scored the highest score). Although brief, this test was sensitive enough to predict
diabetes risk in the current study, and it has previously been found to predict mortality (18).
This study found that both adequate health literacy and higher cognitive ability were
independently associated with lower odds of self-reporting diabetes and with reduced risk of
developing diabetes during a median of 9.5 years follow-up. These associations were
attenuated by health behaviours and education. Individuals with poor health literacy and/or
cognitive ability might tend to lack the health-related and cognitive skills and knowledge
required to look after their health throughout life, which in turn, may increase the risk of
diabetes. Future studies should investigate whether interventions designed to improve the
knowledge and skills required to better self-manage health reduce the risk of developing
diabetes in individuals with low health literacy and cognitive ability.
