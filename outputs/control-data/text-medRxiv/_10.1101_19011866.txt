Abstract
Background: Mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is attributed to
both the micro-vascular and macro-vascular complications. Variation among primary studies was
seen on the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in Africa. Therefore, this study was aimed to
estimate the pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus and its
association with body mass index and glycated hemoglobin in Africa.
Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane library, Scopus, Psyinfo, Africa online journal
and Google Scholar were searched. A funnel plot and Egger’s regression test were used to see
publication bias. I-squared statistic was used to check heterogeneity of studies. DerSimonian and
Laird random-effects model was applied to estimate the pooled effect size. The subgroup and
Meta regression analysis were conducted by country, sample size, and year of publication.
Sensitivity analysis was deployed to see the effect of single study on the overall estimation.
STATA version 14 statistical software was used for meta-analysis.
Result: A total of 20 studies with 5,177 study participants were included to estimate the pooled
prevalence. The pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus was
61.62% (95% CI: 48.35–74.9). BMI ≥ 30kg/m2 (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.73 –2.16), and glycated
hemoglobin ≥ 7% (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.5–5.9), were identified factors though not statistically
significant associated with erectile dysfunction.
Conclusions: The prevalence of erectile dysfunction in Africa remains high. Therefore, situation
based interventions and country context specific preventive strategies could be developed to
reduce the magnitude of erectile dysfunction among patients with diabetes mellitus.

Introduction
Diabetes is a major public health problem, increasingly affecting millions of people across the
globe [1]. About 425 million peoples are suffering from diabetes mellitus (DM) globally in 2017;
by 2045 this will rise to 629 million [2]. In Africa the prevalence of DM will continue to rise,
thus imposing an extra burden on a health care system [3]. Mortality and morbidity in patients
with DM is result from both the micro and macro-vascular complications. One common
complication of diabetes mellitus is erectile dysfunction (ED) [4]. ED is one of the common yet
an underestimated complication of diabetes mellitus [5]. Erectile dysfunction is the inability to
achieve and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse [6]. It may
result from psychological, neurologic, hormonal, arterial impairment or from a combination of
these factors [7].
The pathophysiology of ED in DM is related to multiple mechanisms including endothelial
dysfunction, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress and neuropathy
[5]. Diabetes mellitus promotes the onset of ED via vasculopathy from endothelial dysfunction
and autonomic neuropathy [8]. In addition, diabetes may affect the cavernous nerve terminals
and endothelial cells, resulting in a deficiency of neurotransmitters [9]. It is estimated that the
global prevalence of ED should reach 322 million by 2025 [10]. In a study conducted on
Ethiopian men with diabetes, 79% of patients never complained about ED [11].
Large differences have been reported on prevalence of erectile dysfunction in different studies.
For instance, it has been reported that 49% England [12], 35.8% in Italy [13], 65.4% in Korean
[14], 86.1 in Saudi [15], 31% in Kuwait [16], 38.9 % in India [17], 75.0% in Bénin [18], 77.1%
south Africa [19], and 67.9% in Ghana [20]. The risk factors for ED are multifactorial and
complex. Studies suggest that risk factors for erectile dysfunction in patients with diabetes
mellitus included hypertension[16, 18, 19, 21, 22], heart disease [21], cigarette smoking [16, 19,
21-23], low education level[16], increasing body mass index [16, 17, 20], poor glycemic control
[16, 18, 20, 24], age above or equal to 50 years [16-18, 20, 23, 25], increasing duration of
diabetes [18, 25], presence of depressive symptom [17], high income [20] fat-rich diets[26], and
other diabetic complications [27].

Patients with erectile dysfunction might suffer from poor quality of life[22, 28], anxiety when
sexual ability declines[29], mutual mistrust, general unhappiness, and fear of losing support from
partner [30]. It is known that the good control of the disease is associated with reduced
complications[18]. According to literature evidence about one-third of men with erectile
dysfunction has improvement in sexual function based on lifestyle interventions, such as diet,
exercise and weight loss, cessation of smoking, counseling, and appropriate glycemic control
through diet [31, 32]. Different primary studies in Africa showed the magnitude of erectile
dysfunction. However, variation among those studies was seen. Therefore, this systematic review
and meta-analysis was aimed, to estimate the pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients
with diabetes mellitus and its association with body mass index and glycated hemoglobin in
Africa.
METHODS

Data sources and literature search strategy
Electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Africa journal of online, Scopus, Web of
science, Psyinfo and Cochrane library were searched by authors independently and
systematically. In addition, a manual search of gray literature and other related articles were
deployed to identify additional relevant research. Data from International Diabetic Federation
(IDF) was searched and used. This search employed articles published from 1st January 1990 to
4th September/ 2019. The search was restricted to the full text, free article, study category of
human and English language publications. Likewise, authors were communicated for full text
through email. The search was conducted using the following terms and phrases: “erectile
dysfunction”, “sexual dysfunction”, “impotence” “diabetes mellitus”, and “Africa”. Boolean
operators like “AND” and “OR” were used to combine search terms. Particularly, to fit advanced
PubMed database, the following search strategy was used ("erectile dysfunction" OR impotence
OR "sexual dysfunction") AND ("diabetes mellitus") AND (Africa).

PECOS guide
Type of participants
This review was considered studies that included adult male patients aged 18 or above, and who
have been diagnosed with a DM.
Type of exposure
Study participants who had BMI≥30kg/m2 and glycated hemoglobin greater than 7%
Comparison
Study participants BMI 18.5 – 24.9 kg/m2 and glycated hemoglobin less than 7%
Study Outcome
The outcome of this study was the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among men with diabetes
mellitus
Types of studies design
The systematic review was included studies done using observational designs such as
retrospective or prospective cohort studies, cross-sectional and case control, where erectile
dysfunction among diabetic mellitus patients have been reported.

Eligibility criteria
Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they: (1) All observational studies, which reported
the prevalence of erectile dysfunction;(2) articles published in peer reviewed journals and gray
literature:(3) published in the English language from 1990 to 2019;and (4) studies conducted in
Africa, which included male participants. Studies were excluded if: (1) studies which were not
fully accessed; (2) studies with duplicated citation ;( 3) studies with poor quality score as per
stated criteria; (4) articles in which fail to determine the outcomes (erectile dysfunction); and (5)
studies included only females.

Selection and quality assessment
Two independent investigators were screened the title and abstract. Data were extracted using
standardized data extraction format prepared in a Microsoft excel by three independent authors.

All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

For each article, we extracted data regarding the name of author’s, year of publication, study
area, study design, sample size, data collection year, sampling technique, diagnostic criteria used
for erectile dysfunction, reported prevalence with its 95% confidence interval and information
regarding the associated factors. When some information was missing, first or corresponding
authors of the article were communicated at least twice in a month to obtain the variables of
interest. The quality of each included study was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale [33].
Representativeness of the sample, response rate, measurement tool used, comparability of the
subject, appropriateness of the statistical test used to analyze the data are some of the key criteria
in Newcastle–Ottawa scale. Studies were included in the analysis if they scored ≥5 out of 10
points in three domains of ten modified NOS components for cross-sectional study[34]. Any
disagreements at the time of data abstraction were resolved by discussion and consensus
(Supplementary file 1).

Statistical analysis
To obtain the pooled effect size, a meta-analysis using random-effects DerSimonian and Laird
model was performed [35, 36]. Heterogeneity across the included studies was checked using the
chi-square based Q test and the I2 statistics test with a value ≥75% for the first and P < 0.05
indicating the presence of significant heterogeneity [36]. To investigate the sources of
heterogeneity meta-regression and sub group analyses were performed. Potential publication bias
was assessed by visual inspection of a funnel plot. In addition, Egger regression test was
conducted and a p≤ 0.05was considered statistically significant for the presence of publication
bias [37]. Sensitivity analysis was deployed to see the effect of single study on the overall effect
estimation. The meta-analysis was performed using the STATA version 14 statistical software
for windows [38].

Data synthesis and reporting
To estimate the overall prevalence of erectile dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus, the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was
used [39]. The entire process of study screening, selection and inclusion were described with the
aid of a flow diagram. Results were presented using forest plots and summary tables
(Supplementary file 2-PRISMA checklist).

Result
Search results
In the first step of our search, 1,622 studies were retrieved. About 1,617 studies were found from
seven international databases and the remaining 5 were through manual search. Databases
includes; PubMed (43), Scopus (28), Google scholar (800), web of science (317), Cochrane
library (3), Psyinfo (19) and Africa online journal (407). Of these, 879 duplicate records were
identified and removed. From the remaining 743 articles, 677 articles were excluded after
reading of titles and abstracts based on the pre-defined eligible criteria. Finally, 66 full text
articles were assessed for eligibility criteria. Based on the pre-defined criteria and quality
assessment, only 20 articles were included for the final analysis (Fig. 1)
Figure 1.PRISMA flow chart of study selection

Baseline characteristic of the included studies
In the current meta-analysis, a total of 20 studies with 5,177 study participants were included to
estimate the pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction among DM patients. Concerning study
design, majority (95%) of the studies are cross-sectional. The studies varied substantially in
sample size ranged from 70 to 599. The highest prevalence (95%) of erectile dysfunction was
reported in a study conducted in South Africa[40], whereas the lowest prevalence (15.5%) was
reported in a study conducted in Zimbabwe[41]. Overall information regarding the prevalence
was obtained from various countries in Africa. Three of the studies were from Nigeria [42-44],
three from Ethiopia[11, 45, 46], two from Zimbabwe[41, 47] ,two from South Africa [40, 48],
one each from Guinea[49], Benin[18], Morocco[50], Egypt[24], Senegal[51], Kenya [52], Ivory
coast [53], Tanzania[54], Uganda[55],and Ghana[20].
Regarding the sampling technique employed, in eleven of the studies[11, 20, 24, 41, 43, 44, 47,
50, 52, 53, 55] were used consecutive sampling technique to select study participants. However,
two studies [49, 54] did not report the sampling methods used. Concerning tools, ten studies [24,
43-47, 49, 52-54]

were used international index of erectile function, two [40, 48] used the

sexual health inventory for men, one study [20] used golombok rust inventory of sexual
satisfaction and seven studies[11, 18, 41, 42, 50, 51, 55] did not report the tool used to estimate
the prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with DM. The quality score of each primary study,

Prevalence of erectile dysfunction
The finding of the current meta-analysis using random effects model showed that the estimated
overall prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus was 61.62% (95% CI:
48.35, 74.90) with high significant level of heterogeneity (I2 = 83.4%; p<0.001) (Fig. 2).

Subgroup analysis
To overcome the presence of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis using country, publication year,
sample size, and sampling technique was done. Based on this, the prevalence of erectile
dysfunction found to be 71.37% in Nigeria, 67.29% in publication year above 2010, and 62.24%
sample size greater or equal to three hundred (Table 2).

Meta-regression analysis
To identify source of heterogeneity meta-regression was undertaken by considering year of
publication, sample size and sampling technique. However, the result of meta regression showed
that both covariates were not statistically significant for the presence of heterogeneity (Table 3).

Body mass index
The pooled effects of five studies showed that body mass index ≥ 30kg/m2 was not statistically
associated with erectile dysfunction (Fig. 5). The heterogeneity test (I2= 89.5%) shows
significant evidence of variation across studies. The evidence from Egger’s test shows that there
was a no publication bias (P = 0.807).

Glycosylated hemoglobin (Hga1c)
According to the recent meta-analysis, those who had normal glycated hemoglobin were 7% less
likely to develop erectile dysfunction compared to those who had glycated hemoglobin value ≥

Discussion
The prevalence of erectile dysfunction in this meta-analysis estimated 61.62 % in patients with
diabetes mellitus. This implies that there is a high magnitude of erectile dysfunction among
diabetic patients, which shows inadequate control of diabetes mellitus related complication.
Hence, serious and multifactorial approach is required to manage the diabetic related
complications, which emphasis on the treatment adherence, screening for complication,
encourage on self-care practice, and health information dissemination.
In comparison with other similar studies, this estimated prevalence of erectile dysfunction in
Africa seems significant higher than report from a systematic review and meta-analysis
conducted at global level that implies the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among diabetic
patients was 52.5% [56]. This variation could be justified by the different diagnostic criteria of
erectile dysfunction, the age of the participants in each study, duration and severity of diabetes in
their participants.
The subgroup analysis of this study showed that the pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction
among diabetic patients in Nigeria was 71.37% (95% CI: 38.3, 104.4) which is higher than the
prevalence in Ethiopia 68.12% (95% CI: 46.3, 89.9), South Africa 65.5% (95% CI; 7.9, 123.3),
and Zimbabwe 44.69% (95% CI: 12.5, 101.1). This variation might be due to difference in health
seeking behavior between the populations, differences in the diagnostic methods and sociodemographic characteristics.
Though we have identified two factors (body mass index and glycated hemoglobin), to conduct
the pooled analysis of two or more AOR of studies, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and glycated hemoglobin

≥7% were not associated with erectile dysfunction among diabetic patients. Those who had BMI
≥ 30 kg/m2 were 26% more likely to develop erectile dysfunction. Thought it is not statistically
significant. This finding supported by other studies conducted in Vietnam [57] and Brazil [58].
Those who had glycosylated hemoglobin < 7% were 7% less likely to develop erectile
dysfunction. Thought it is not statistically significant. However, this finding supported by other
studies conducted in Korean[14] and china [59].

This study has an implication for clinical practice and patients. Estimating the overall prevalence
of erectile dysfunction provide current evidence to design preventive measure ,to improve patient
quality of life, early detection of poorly controlled diabetic mellitus, close monitoring of poor
patient progress and management strategy for ED. In addition, identifying associated factors help
health care professional to consider during their clinical care.
Although this meta-analysis conducted with the use of comprehensive search strategy to
incorporate the studies there are some limitations that need to be considered in the future
research: First, It may be lacked representativeness because no data were found from the entire
continent; second, only English articles were considered; and third, this study do not identify all
the predictors of erectile dysfunction among patients with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we would
like to recommend the conduct of further study using similar diagnostic tool to identify
associated factors for the development of erectile dysfunction among patient with diabetes
mellitus.

Conclusion and recommendations
This study revealed that the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was remains high in Africa.
Besides, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction differed by country. Therefore, situation based
interventions and country context specific preventive strategies could be developed to reduce the
magnitude of erectile dysfunction among patients with diabetes mellitus.
