ABSTRACT

30
31

Background: Thermal damage to the esophagus is a risk from radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the left

32

atrium for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), with the most extreme type of thermal injury resulting

33

in atrio-esophageal fistula (AEF), with a correspondingly high mortality rate. Various approaches have

34

been developed to reduce esophageal injury, including power reduction, avoidance of greater contact-

35

force, esophageal deviation, and esophageal cooling. One method of esophageal cooling involves direct

36

instillation of cold water or saline into the esophagus during RF ablation. Although this method provides

37

limited heat-extraction capacity, studies of it have suggested potential benefit.

38
39

Objective: We sought to perform a meta-analysis of existing studies evaluating esophageal cooling via

40

direct liquid instillation for the reduction of thermal injury.

41
42

Methods: We reviewed Medline for existing studies involving esophageal cooling for protection of

43

thermal injury during RF ablation. A meta-analysis was then performed using random effects model to

44

calculate estimated effect size with 95% confidence intervals, with outcome of esophageal lesions,

45

stratified by severity, as determined by post-procedure endoscopy.

46
47

Results: A total of 9 studies were identified and reviewed. After excluding pre-clinical and mathematical

48

model studies, 3 were included in the meta-analysis, totaling 494 patients. Esophageal cooling showed a

49

tendency to shift lesion severity downward, such that total lesions did not show a statistically significant

50

change (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.38). For high grade lesions, a significant OR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.17 to

51

0.89) in favor of esophageal cooling was found, suggesting that esophageal cooling, even utilizing a low-

52

capacity thermal extraction technique, reduces lesion severity from RF ablation.

Conclusions: Esophageal cooling reduces lesion severity encountered during RF ablation, even when

using relatively low heat extraction methods such as direct instillation of cold liquid. Further

56

investigation of this approach is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

59

Thermal damage to the esophagus is a risk from radiofrequency (RF) ablation or cryoablation of the left

60

atrium for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF).[1-3] The most extreme type of thermal injury is an

61

atrio-esophageal fistula (AEF), with a mortality rate of 80% or more.[4-8] Various approaches have been

62

developed to reduce esophageal injury, including power reduction, avoidance of greater contact-force,

63

temperature monitoring, esophageal deviation, and esophageal cooling. Different esophageal protection

64

approaches have been evaluated including temperature monitoring, esophageal deviation, and power

65

reduction, with varying degrees of success in reducing esophageal injury.[9-11]

66
67

Esophageal cooling has also been investigated in multiple studies for the purpose of protecting the

68

esophagus during RF ablation. [12-20] Various approaches to cooling have been utilized, including

69

expandable balloon devices, a cooling sac circulating water, and direct instillation of ice-cold water or

70

saline into the esophagus, with investigations utilizing animal models, mathematical models, and human

71

clinical studies. The majority of human clinical studies have utilized direct instillation of ice cold water

72

or saline. We sought to perform a meta-analysis of these existing data to examine the range of effect sizes

73

published to date and estimate the potential efficacy of esophageal cooling for protection during RF

74

ablation.

77

Data sources and search strategy

78

We utilized PubMed to perform a search of the literature from 1985 (prior to the earliest reports of

79

endocardial ablation to treat atrial fibrillation) to June 2019 for studies published on esophageal cooling

80

during cardiac ablation using a broad search with the following Boolean structure: (esophag* OR

81

oesophag*) AND cooling AND (ablation OR fibrillation) We did not restrict to English only. Details of

82

the systematic review were submitted for registration in PROSPERO on June 21, 2019.

83

Eligibility criteria

84

We excluded pre-clinical studies, bench-top, agar phantom, and mathematical model studies, and studies

85

that did not include formal endoscopy as an outcome measure.

86

Data collection

87

The primary data of interest were endoscopically identified lesions found after RF ablation. Because we

88

anticipated inconsistency in the categorization of lesion severity, we decided to simplify all lesion

89

severity measurement into severe lesions characterized by the presence of ulceration and mild to moderate

90

lesions encompassing all other abnormalities.

91

Statistical analysis

92

We input study data into Review Manager 5.3 to perform meta-analysis of the data entered, and present

93

the results graphically. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for additional

94

analyses. The Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method was employed to test the null hypothesis that

95

the response rate is the same for the two arms (control versus treatment), after adjusting for possible

96

differences in study response rates. Furthermore, we fitted a random effect model using SAS procedures

97

GLIMMIX and NLMIXED by treating the study as a random effect. Because lesion grades are often

98

considered to be dichotomized into those that are likely to progress to atrio-esophageal fistula, and those

99

that are not, we initially analyzed the data as a binary outcome (high grade lesions concerning for

100

progression versus low grade lesions likely to heal spontaneously). Then, to further estimate effect size,

101

we used an ordinal logistic random intercept model, taking into account the ordered nature of lesion

102

grading (low to high, numerically).

103

RESULTS

104

A total of 9 studies were identified using the above criteria and additional search strategy. Five of these

105

were excluded for being non-clinical. Berjano et al. utilized a finite element model in three dimensions to

106

investigate the effects of a cooled intra-esophageal balloon.[12] Lequerica et al. performed studies using

107

an agar phantom-based model that was built to provide temperature readings at points between the

108

esophageal lumen and the myocardium.[13, 14] Arruda et al. studied a custom developed system utilizing

109

temperature controlled saline or water in an in vitro lamb heart and esophagus preparation, followed by an

110

in vivo model with six dogs.[15] Scanavacca et al. presented a study of the use of a saline filled

111

esophageal balloon to attempt esophageal protection in a dog model.[17] A clinical study by Tsuchiya et

112

al. involving 8 patients was excluded for not utilizing endoscopy to determine the presence of lesions

113

after RF ablation.[16]

114

The remaining 3 studies included a total of 494 patients:

115

John et. al performed a study of 76 patients, half given active cooling performed by injecting a 20 mL

116

bolus of ice-cold saline via orogastric tube into the upper esophagus if/when the luminal esophageal

117

temperature increased by 0.5 °C above baseline.[20] The authors found that this method of esophageal

118

cooling did not decrease the overall incidence of thermal lesions, but noted a trend toward fewer severe

119

lesions with cooling (Fig 1). Esophageal thermal lesions were graded as follows: grade 0: no esophageal

120

lesion; grade 1: mucosal damage <1 cm width; grade 2: mucosal damage 1–3 cm width; grade 3: mucosal

121

damage > 3 cm width or visualization of deeper layer; and grade 4: bleeding ulcer or with overlying clot.

Kuwahara et. al performed a study of 100 patients using very small volumes (5 mL) of ice water as the

126

which was injected prior to RF energy delivery, and subsequently when esophageal temperatures reached

127

42°C.[18] The severity of the esophageal lesions was qualitatively graded as mild, moderate, or severe,

128

according to their extent and color, with the severe category corresponding to those categorized as grade

129

III or IV by John et al. The authors found that this approach reduced the severity of esophageal lesions,

130

but did not reduce their incidence: lesions occurred in 20% of the experimental group, and 22% of the

controls, with 3 moderate and 7 mild in the cooled group and 3 severe, 1 moderate, and 7 mild in the

Sohara et. al utilized an infusion of cooled saline mixed with Gastrografin or Iopamidol, with slightly

138

higher, but still limited volumes (10 – 20 mL) in repeated injected aliquots with a temperature of

139

approximately 10°C.[19] A total of 318 patients were randomized between groups receiving only

140

temperature monitoring without cooling, temperature monitoring with cooling when temperature

141

exceeded 43°C, and temperature monitoring with cooling received when temperatures exceeded 39°C.

142

The percentage of patients free from any ulceration or erosion in each group was found to be 63.6%,

143

87.5%, and 95.2%, respectively (Fig 3). Esophageal lesions were classified as normal (score 1), erosion

144

(patchy mucosal ulceration: score 2), mild ulcer (necrosis less than 3 mm in diameter with red spot: score

145

3), severe ulcer (necrosis more than 3 mm in diameter with red spot and/or with a hemorrhagic

151

category represents all those graded as ulcers (score 3 or 4 in the author’s categorization system).

152

In 2 of these 3 studies, a clear shift from high-grade to lower-grade lesions can be seen between the

153

control and treatment arms.[18, 20] In contrast, in Sohara et al., a general reduction of all grade lesions is

seen.[19]Further details on the characteristics of each study are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3.

studies, in meta-analysis this did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.38).

DISCUSSION

188

Esophageal injury from RF ablation remains a feared complication in the treatment of atrial fibrillation,

189

and a variety of approaches have been developed to reduce this risk. Esophageal cooling has shown

190

promise in a number of studies, generally utilizing low-capacity cooling approaches, such as direct

191

instillation of cold water or saline directly into the esophagus via orogastric tube. Even with the limited

192

heat extraction capacity of this approach, our meta-analysis of 3 studies suggests that cooling in this

193

manner offers a clinically significant protective effect from severe lesions, and provides a 61% reduction

194

in high grade lesion formation (with a 95% CI of 11% to 83% reduction).

195

Cooling via direct instillation of cold liquid into the esophagus is limited in actual heat extraction capacity

196

by low volumes of direct liquid instillation. Even with the relatively high heat capacity of water, the total

197

volumes (5mL to 20 mL at a time) serve as a significant limitation to the amount of thermal energy that

198

can be absorbed. Higher heat extraction capacity has been evaluated in the past with various balloon

199

device prototypes, where flow rates of 25 mL to 300 mL per minute were utilized. [13-16] These may

200

offer greater heat extraction, and pre-clinical as well as mathematical models of early prototypes

201

suggested benefits in lesion reduction, but none of these prototypes evolved into commercially-available

202

products.

203

A device currently being investigated in clinical studies, designed for whole-body temperature

204

manipulation, has a flow rate of up to 1900 mL per minute, far greater than any devices previously

205

evaluated. This device is a commercially available esophageal cooling device utilized for general

206

temperature management (inducing hypothermia, maintaining normothermia, or patient warming), and

207

has shown protective effects in animal and mathematical models, as well as in recently presented clinical

208

data.[21, 22]

209

A recent study on the prevalence and prevention of esophageal injury during atrial fibrillation ablation

210

performed a meta-analysis of two studies of direct instillation of ice-cold water, but failed to distinguish

211

between lesion severity and lesion frequency, focusing on the outcome of overall lesion frequency.[23]

212

In contrast, our study had the benefit of an additional publication, and we analyzed data stratified by

213

severity of lesions. Although a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of AEF formation is still

214

developing, there is general agreement that thermal injury is a precursor, and that higher-grade thermal

215

injury has higher risk of progression to AEF.[24]

216

Taking into account each lesion grade independently in a statistical model allows an alternative approach

217

to estimate effect size that may provide further refinement of the estimate, at the cost of decreased

218

precision. We found a point estimate using this approach suggesting a reduction in high-grade lesions of -

219

23%, although a higher number of patients with a greater number of high-grade lesions are necessary to

220

narrow the confidence intervals around this estimate, which with the population included here, ranges

221

from -85% to +38%. On the other hand, utilizing a methodology with greater performance and higher

222

heat extraction capacity may increase the effect size point estimate further when either binary logistic or

223

ordinal regression is utilized.

224
225

LIMITATIONS

226

The studies analyzed in this report differed in specific RF techniques and equipment. Nevertheless, all

227

used radiofrequency ablation, and the variation in technology reflects real-world practice currently. The

228

studies reviewed did not all utilize randomization, and there was no description of any attempt at blinding

229

the patients to the protection strategy used. Lesion grading varied between studies, but each scale

230

involved a lesion characterization that allowed stratifying on common ground. Patient characteristics and

231

ablation technologies and techniques utilized in the evaluated studies differed in many aspects; however,

232

this may serve to broaden the generalizability of these findings.

233
234

CONCLUSIONS

235

Esophageal cooling reduces lesion severity encountered during RF ablation, even when using relatively

236

low heat extraction methods such as direct instillation of small amounts of cold liquid. Further

237

investigation of this approach is warranted, particularly utilizing higher heat extraction technology such as

238

closed-circuit devices with high coolant flow rates.
