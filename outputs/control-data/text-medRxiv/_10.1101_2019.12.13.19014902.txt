ABSTRACT
OASIS-3 is a compilation of MRI and PET imaging and related clinical data for 1098
participants who were collected across several ongoing studies in the Washington
University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center over the course of 15 years.
Participants include 605 cognitively normal adults and 493 individuals at various stages
of cognitive decline ranging in age from 42 to 95 years. The OASIS-3 dataset contains
over 2000 MR sessions, including multiple structural and functional sequences. PET
metabolic and amyloid imaging includes over 1500 raw imaging scans and the
accompanying post-processed files from the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP) are also
available in OASIS-3. OASIS-3 also contains post-processed imaging data such as
volumetric segmentations and PET analyses. Imaging data is accompanied by
dementia and APOE status and longitudinal clinical and cognitive outcomes. OASIS-3 is
available as an open access data set to the scientific community to answer questions
related to healthy aging and dementia.

BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is a multimodal collection of data
focused on the effects of healthy aging and Alzheimer disease (AD) that is freely
available to the scientific community. Previously released OASIS-Cross-sectional1 and
OASIS-Longitudinal2 have been cited over 500 times. Data from these projects have
been extensively used in the development of neuroimaging tools, such as brain
atlases3,4, tissue segmentation algorithms5, and de-identification tools6, used to create
models of healthy aging7,8 and AD timecourse7–11, used to answer hypothesis driven
questions12,13, and used for educational and training purposes. Here we describe the

OASIS-3 data release, which expands upon these prior releases.
OASIS-3 incorporates data from 1098 participants covering the adult life span aged 42
to 95, including cognitively normal individuals and individuals with early-stage AD
dementia. The OASIS-3 release includes structural and functional MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging), amyloid and metabolic PET (positron emission tomography)
imaging, neuropsychological testing, and clinical data. Figure 1 shows the distribution of
serial MRI and PET acquisition containing over 500 subjects with longitudinal MRI
scans and over 400 with serial PET scans. The expansive data provided in OASIS-3
can be utilized as an individual dataset or in combination with other open data
answering a multitude of research topics. Key features of OASIS-3 are:
1) Clinical and Cognitive assessments are standardized through the Uniform
Dataset (UDS) allowing for combination with multiple Alzheimer open data
projects
2) In addition to raw MRI and PET data, OASIS-3 includes post-processed
statistical outputs, regional segmentations, and structure files. These can be
used for a multitude of applications such as development of PET processing
tools, improving volumetric segmentation, and analyzing individual structural
differences.
3) OASIS-3 expands upon prior OASIS projects by providing longitudinal, multiparametric MR imaging such as ASL, BOLD, DTI, SWI, and FLAIR. This variety
of imaging data enables investigators to examine the longitudinal changes across
multiple tissue types develop better imaging models of aging and cognitive
impairment.

OASIS-3 is strong dataset that can be evaluated as an independent source or provide a
valuable supplement to additional datasets. While there are other Alzheimer databases
available, such as the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), to the
research community, OASIS-3 is unique in that the initial enrollment focused on preclinical cohort and followed longitudinal progression, whereas ADNI enrolled individuals
with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. By providing Centiloid (Su et al53) data for
all amyloid tracers OASIS-3 is helping with standardization in the neuroimaging
community. Analyses of OASIS-3 data will aid in clinical trial design and provide pilot
results and power calculations necessary for future funding. In the future we intend to
provide updates to OASIS-3 with biomarker data (i.e. cerebrospinal fluid), tau PET
imaging, and additional longitudinal timepoints. In summary, we are providing a dataset
that will be a valuable asset to the scientific community.

Methods
Participants
Recruitment and Exclusion Criterion
OASIS-3 includes participants enrolled into several ongoing studies through the Charles
F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) at
Washington University in St. Louis spanning over 15 years and several research studies
- Memory and Aging Project, Adult Children Study14, and Healthy Aging and Senile
Dementia. Each study targets varying cohorts but include similar assessments and visit
intervals. The following cohorts were recruited: (1) Individuals who were generally

healthy, were cognitively normal (CDR = 0), and had a family history of AD , defined as
being a biologic child of at least one parent with a reported history of AD dementia with
onset age 80 years; (2) individuals who were generally healthy, were cognitively normal
(CDR = 0), and had no family history of AD for either biological parent and lived at least
to age 70 years; and (3) healthy individuals 65 and older, both those who were
cognitively normal (CDR 0) and this with very mild-mild symptomatic AD (CDR 0.5 and
1). Exclusion criterion included medical conditions that precluded longitudinal
participation

(eg,

end-stage

renal

disease

requiring

dialysis)

or

medical

contraindications for the study arms (e.g. pacemaker for MRI, anticoagulant use for
lumbar puncture). Participants were recruited from the community via flyers, word of
mouth, and community engagements. Participants from all cohorts agreed to submit an
initial blood sample for genetic testing, complete regular cognitive testing, and
neuroimaging and lumbar punctures approximately every 2-3 years. Each participant
was enrolled along with a collateral source, someone who knew the participants well
(eg, spouse of adult child) and could report whether the participant’s current cognitive
and functional performance was or was not at previously attained levels. All participants
were consented into Knight ADRC-related projects following procedures approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Washington University School of Medicine.

Imaging inclusion/exclusion
Participants enrolled in studies at the Knight ADRC Clinical Core were referred to the
Knight ADRC Research Imaging (KARI) Program for magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. All participants were required to

have a CDR ≤1 at the time of most recent Clinical Core assessment. Participants
completed screening for general health information to assess any contraindications to
PET or MR imaging. Participants were excluded for the following health reasons:
women who were pregnant or breastfeeding; implanted medical devices such as
pacemakers and drug pump; history or risk of metal in the eye; and history of
claustrophobia. Eligible participants signed informed consent for one of the KARI
imaging studies that included MR only, PET only, or MR and PET scans. To the best
effort of investigators, participants underwent scan sessions within six months of Clinical
Core visits. Across the years of scanning, gaps in funding, funding for additional substudies, or participant related delays, have caused variations in visit timelines resulting
in extended or decreased intervals.

Clinical assessments and ADRC data collection procedures
Participants completed clinical assessment protocols in accordance with National
Alzheimer Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set15,16 (UDS).

UDS assessments

included family history of AD, medical history, physical examination, and neurological
evaluation. Participants age 64 or younger underwent clinical and cognitive
assessments every 3 years. Participants age 65 and older had annual clinical and
cognitive assessments. Dementia status was assessed for the UDS using the Clinical
Dementia Rating17 (CDR) Scale, with CDR 0 indicating normal cognitive function, CDR
0.5 very mild impairment, CDR 1 mild impairment, and CDR 2 moderate dementia; once
a participant reached CDR 2, they no longer were eligible for in-person assessments .

The OASIS datatype “ADRC Clinical Data” includes age at entry, height, weight, CDR
evaluations (UDS form B1 and B4 variables).
During the assessment, clinicians completed a diagnostic impression intake and
interview culminating with a coded dementia diagnosis that is recorded in the OASIS
datatype “ADRC Clinical Data” dx1-dx5. Diagnoses for this variable include “cognitively
normal”, “AD dementia”, “vascular dementia” and contributing factors such as vitamin
deficiency, alcoholism, and mood disorders. The diagnostic determination for variables
dx1-dx5 is separate from UDS assessments, however they may overlap in diagnostic
conclusions.

UDS form A1 includes participant demographics such as disease status at study entry,
sex, race, language, education, type of residence, level of independence, marital status,
and handedness. UDS form A2 includes demographic information about the participant'
designated informant. Information about the AD status of the participant's parents,
siblings, children, and other relatives is available in UDS form A3. Participant's health
history is reported in UDS form A5. Cerebrovascular health and stroke history are
recorded in UDS form B2. UDS form B3 represents the Unified Parkinson's Disease
Rating Scale (UPDRS). Form B5 records the participant’s neuropsychiatric history while
Form B6 includes the Geriatric Depression Scale. UDS Form B7 includes the Functional
Assessment Questionnaire including questions about daily activities. Clinician reports
include Form B8 - Physical and neurological findings, Form B9 - clinician based
judgement of symptoms, and Form D1 – Clinician diagnosis – Cognitive status and
Dementia.

Neuropsychological Assessment
Participants aged 65 and older annually completed a battery of neuropsychological tests
at the ADRC16,18. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) measures general
cognitive status, with scores ranging from 0 (severe impairment to 30 (no impairment).
Logical Memory - Story A, a subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised measures
episodic memory. Participants recall as many details as they can from a short story
containing 25 bits of information after it is read aloud by the examiner and again after a
30-minute delay, with scores ranging from 0 (no recall) to 25 (complete recall). Digit
Span requires participants to repeat back a series of digits forward and backwards
providing measures of attention and working memory. Scores were based on the
number of trials repeated correctly forwards and backwards, as well as the longest
length the participant is able to repeat back. Semantic memory and language were
measured using the Category Fluency test, requiring participants to name as many
words belonging to a category, animal and vegetable, in 60 seconds, and the Boston
Naming Test, in which participants name drawings of common objects. Psychomotor
speed was measured using the WAIS-R Digit Symbol test and the Trail Making Test
Part A. The WAIS-R Digit Symbol test is scored on the number of digit symbol pairs
completed in 90 seconds. Executive function was measured using the Trail Making Test
Part B. In the Trail Making Test participants were asked to make a trail by connecting a
series of numbers (1-26) for part A and connecting a series of alternating numbers and
letters (1-A-2-B) for part B. Outcome measures include total time to complete in
seconds with a max of 150s for Trails A and 300s for Trails B, number of commission

reports in the Psych Assessment form.

Genotyping (APOE)
The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) has been identified for its influence on Alzheimer’s
disease. The APOE ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E gene (APOE ε4) has been linked to
increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease19 while the ε2 allele (APOE ε2) may provide
protection from Alzheimer’s disease20,21. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood

Neuroimaging Data description
Scanners
All neuroimaging scans were conducted by the Knight Alzheimer Research Imaging
Program at Washington University in St. Louis. MRI was collected on 3 different
Siemens scanner models (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc): Vision 1.5T, TIM Trio
3T (2 different scanners of this model), and BioGraph mMR PET-MR 3T. Positron
emission tomography (PET) was conducted on 3 different Siemens PET scanners:
ECAT HR+ 962 PET scanner, Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner, and BioGraph mMR PETMR 3T. All sessions collected simultaneously on the BioGraph mMR scanner have been
split into individual PET and MRI sessions for archiving purposes. Participants were

placed in a 16-channel head coil on 1.5T scanners and 20-channel head coil on 3T
scanners with foam pad stabilizers placed next to the ears to decrease motion. Some
participants had a vitamin-E fiducial marker placed on the left temple.

MRI
MRI Sequences
MR imaging includes various anatomical and functional sequences. High resolution
structural sequences include T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and TSE, susceptibility
weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), arterial spin labeling (ASL),
resting state BOLD, fieldmaps, time of flight (TOF). Susceptibility weighted imaging
(SWI) sequences include magnitude, phase, minimum intensity projection (mIP), and a
combination of the magnitude and phase creating a single SWI image. SWI imaging is
used to identify micro hemorrhages. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive
sequence designed to evaluate cerebral blood flow similar to invasive perfusion
sequences. Time of Flight (TOF) is an angiography sequence designed to look at blood
vessels without administration of a contrast agent. Participants were asked to lay quietly
with their eyes open while two 6 minute resting state BOLD sequences were collected
to evaluate neural activity at rest. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences included in
OASIS-3 were designed to investigate fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion
coefficient, and can be used to create 3D white matter tracts. Diffusion sequences
collected on the PET-MR were acquired with 64 directions, while sequences collected
on other scanner models were acquired with 24-26 directions. Fieldmap images were

acquired to correct for field inhomogeneities and often used with BOLD and DTI
imaging. Acquisition parameters for each sequence are available in the accompanying
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. A spreadsheet is provided with the OASIS-3
data including common parameters of interest for each scan type.

MRI Post-Processing: FreeSurfer volumetric segmentation
All MR imaging sessions were subjected to cortical reconstruction and volumetric
segmentation of T1-weighted images using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite, which
is

(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The technical details of these procedures are
described in prior publications23–34. Briefly, this processing includes motion correction
and averaging34 of volumetric T1 weighted images, removal of non-brain tissue using a
hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure33, automated Talairach transformation,
segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures
(including hippocampus, amygdala,

caudate, putamen, ventricles)26,27 intensity

normalization35, tessellation of the gray matter white matter boundary, automated
topology correction25,36, and surface deformation following intensity gradients to
optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where
the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class23,24.
Once the cortical models are complete, a number of deformable procedures were
performed for further data processing and analysis including surface inflation (Fischl et
al., 1999a), registration to a spherical atlas which is based on individual cortical folding

patterns to match cortical geometry across subjects (Fischl et al., 1999b), parcellation of
the cerebral cortex into units with respect to gyral and sulcal structure37 (Fischl et al.,
2004b), and creation of a variety of surface based data including maps of curvature and
sulcal depth. This method uses both intensity and continuity information from the entire
three dimensional MR volume in segmentation and deformation procedures to produce
representations of cortical thickness, calculated as the closest distance from the
gray/white boundary to the gray/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated
surface24. The maps are created using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes
and are therefore not simply reliant on absolute signal intensity. The maps produced are
not restricted to the voxel resolution of the original data thus are capable of detecting
submillimeter differences between groups. Procedures for the measurement of cortical
thickness

Data included in OASIS-3 were processed using an XNAT pipeline for the FreeSurfer
image analysis suite using Dell PowerEdge 1950 servers with Intel Xeon processors
running CentOS 5.5 Linux. T1-weighted images collected on 1.5T scanners were
processed with FreeSurfer v5.0 or v5.1 with the patch correcting for inaccurate ICV
values (FreeSurfer Patch 10Dec2012). T1-weighted images from the 3T scanners were

regional volume statistics and the post-processed output files for all segmentations that
passed QC. Segmentations with a “fail” QC status were excluded from OASIS-3.
Statistical data for volumetric regions is available for download in spreadsheet format.
FreeSurfer post-processed output images such as surface maps and segmented
volumes have also been provided for download.

PET
Tracers and Acquisition Protocols
Participants underwent positron emission tomography on one of three different Siemens
scanners: ECAT HRplus 962 PET scanner, Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner, Biograph
mMR PET-MR. A softened thermoplastic mask with enlarged eye holes was placed
over the head and secured to minimize head motion or HRplus and PET/CT scanners.
A transmission scan was obtained for attenuation correction on the HRplus scanner. On
the Siemens Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner a three-second X-ray Topogram was
acquired in the lateral plane to visualize the head and determine the exact scan

position. Prior to the PET scan, a spiral CT (Computed Tomography) scan was
performed for attenuation correction at the low dose CT. On the Siemens mMR PETMR a series of Dixon based tissue segmented MR scans were acquired to create a
Dixon μmap used for attenuation correction. Frame timing information for each scan is
provided in an accompanying tsv file.

β-amyloid (Aβ) Imaging
Two radiopharmaceuticals, Pittsburgh Compound B ([11C]PIB or PIB) and Florbetapir
[18F] (18F-AV-45 or AV45), were used to investigate β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in the brain.
For PIB PET scans, participants received an I.V. bolus administration of 6 - 20 mCi of
[11C]PIB with a 60 minute dynamic PET scan in 3D mode (24 x 5 sec frames; 9 x 20 sec
frames; 10 x 1 min frames; 9 x 5 min frames). For Florbetapir PET scans, participants
received a single I.V. bolus administration of 10 mCi (+-10%) of [18F]AV45 with dynamic
PET scan in 3D mode. There were two acceptable procedures for obtaining Florbetapir
PET scans to capture the 50-70min uptake window: (1) in the preferred approach, the
participants were positioned in the PET-MR scanner at the time of injection and a
dynamic 70-minute scan (consisting of 4 x 15sec frames, 8 x 30sec frames, 9 x 1 min, 2
x 3 min frames, 10 x 5 min frames) was obtained starting at the time of injection (2) for
those participants who were unable to tolerate the full exam, PET-MR scanning began
50 minutes after Florbetapir injection with a dynamic 20min (consisting of 4x5min
frames) PET acquisition. In the event of technical problems participants may have been
scanned on an alternate available PET scanner. All PET scan parameters are available
in the accompanying JSON file.

Metabolic Imaging
Metabolic imaging with FDG was performed on the HR+ PET scanner. Participants
were asked to eat a normal breakfast then fast for 4hrs prior to FDG administration.
Prior to tracer administration plasma glucose concentration was verified and individuals
were excluded if blood glucose concentrations >=165. Participants received an I.V.
bolus injection of 5 mCi of [18F]FDG followed by a dynamic 60min (consisting of 24 x 5
sec frames, 9 x 20 sec frames, 10 x 1 min frames and 9 x 5 min frames) PET
acquisition.

PET Post-Processing: PUP
PET imaging analyses were performed using the PET unified pipeline42,43 (PUP,
https://github.com/ysu001/PUP) via XNAT on Dell PowerEdge 1950 servers with Intel
Xeon processors running CentOS 5.5 Linux. PET images were smoothed to achieve a
common spatial resolution of 8mm to minimize inter-scanner differences44. Inter-frame
motion correction for the dynamic PET images is performed using standard image
registration techniques45,46. PET to MR registration is performed using a vector-gradient
algorithm47 (VGM) in a symmetric fashion (i.e. average transformation for PET->MR and
inverse of MR->PET was used as the final transformation matrix). Regional PET
processing is performed based on FreeSurfer segmentation using wmparc.mgz as the
region definition, and each FreeSurfer region is analyzed. When FreeSurfer processing
of matching T1w image failed, PET processing was excluded from OASIS-3. The PUP

pipeline generates both reports of regional measurements as well as a voxel-wise
SUVR image in the individual FreeSurfer space.

PUP also accounts for partial volume effects (PVE) that are the result of spatial
distortion from low resolution PET images. The distortion caused by PVE is directly
related to the size and shape of the region of interest in addition to spatial resolution of
the images. In longitudinal studies, the impact of PVE can be further confounded by
brain atrophy due to aging and pathological changes. PUP accounts for these distortion
correction technique is implemented using a regional spread function (RSF) based
approach42,48. Su et al.42,49 has demonstrated that the RSF technique was able to
improve PET quantification and achieve better sensitivity to longitudinal changes in
amyloid burden. PUP processed results include results both with and without RSF
partial volume correction and SUVR voxel-wise images produced without partial volume
correction.
Two modeling approaches are implemented in PUP using the cerebellum as a
reference region. Binding potential (BPND) is calculated using Logan graphical
analysis42,43,49–51, for full dynamic PET imaging data are available, i.e. PET acquisition
was started in synchronization with tracer administration and PET images were
reconstructed into multiple time frames. Non-logan graphical analysis is used to process

PET Post-Processing: Centiloid Standardization
Amyloid specific processing assessed global amyloid burden of each tracer and
included a Centiloid conversion to provide comparable values across amyloid tracers.
To assess global amyloid burden based on amyloid PET imaging data, the mean
cortical binding potential (MCBP) or mean cortical SUVR (MCSUVR) were calculated
from the arithmetic mean of BPND or SUVRs from four critical regions: 1) precuneus
(PREC) defined as the combined left and right hemisphere ctx-precuneus, 2) prefrontal
cortex (PREF) defined as the left and right combined ctx-superior frontal and ctx-rostral
middle frontal regions, 3) gyrus rectus (GR) defined as the left and right combined ctxlateral orbitofrontal and ctx-medial orbitofrontal regions, and 4) lateral temporal (TEMP)
defined as the left and right combined ctx-superior temporal and ctx-middle temporal
regions43. In order to provide standard quantification of amyloid analysis across lab
protocols and tracers, the Centiloid scale has been developed to convert amyloid PET
data to a 0-100 scale52. Both PIB and Florbetapir amyloid imaging have been calibrated
on the Centiloid scale based on equations presented in Su et al53 and are available in
OASIS-3.

with HIPAA regulations, Protected Health Information (PHI) has been excluded from the
release. Individuals aged 90> were able to be included by removing all referential dates
from the released data we were able to include data for individuals aged 90>. Additional
altered variables include: original participant identifiers, free text fields, location specific
information stored in supplemental files. Across all datatypes, dates and visits are now
represented as days from entry into the parent Knight ADRC project.
Because OASIS-3 images were acquired over 10+ years on multiple scanners, source
images were generated in a diversity of file formats (DICOM, IMA, ECAT). To provide a
single standard format, the sources data files were converted to NifTI format files using
the dcm2niix54 conversion program and are organized and named following the Brain
Imaging Data Structure55 (BIDS). One benefit of using BIDS is that the supplied NifTI
files include only geometric information about the image and, therefore, free of
protected health information. A second benefit of adopting the BIDS data structure is
that it provides a standardized naming convention, file organization, and supplemental
file information that can be used to facilitate downstream processing and analysis. Key
acquisition information, such as magnet strength, scanner model, repetition time, and
slice timing typically found in the DICOM formatted data are provided with the BIDS
supplemental metadata in a JSON file. Raw and processed data, such as FreeSurfer
and PUP outputs and statistics, underwent rigorous de-identification procedures that
removed original subject IDs, scan IDs, and procedure dates from images and statistics
files and replaced them with OASIS labels and generic dates (ex. 01/01/1970) or days
from entry (ex. d1234). These methods were intended to remove all protected health
information while maintaining provenance.

also expressly forbidden from attempting to identify participants. Once a user agrees to
the DUT, they are provided with login credentials. The OASIS-3 data are hosted on
XNAT Central56 (https://central.xnat.org), a publicly accessible data-repository. Each
data point on XNAT Central has a unique identifier with URL that provides a persistent
link to the data.

Technical Validation
Exploratory MRI and PET Analyses
Exploratory descriptive analyses were performed on the MRI and PET data in OASIS-3
to demonstrate feasibility of MRI and PET analyses in conjunction with behavioral
measures. Groups were defined based on their longitudinal CDR score - Stable
Controls as individuals with CDR = 0; Converters started with CDR = 0 and progressed
to CDR >0; Dementia at aging started in the study with CDR > 0. Figure 2a depicts the
longitudinal trajectory of whole brain volume (WBV) atrophy in stable controls compared
to converters and those with dementia at entry. There is a significant difference in

baseline WBV (F(2,974) = 32.36, p < 0.001; Figure 3a) with larger baseline WBV in both
stable controls (t(749) = 7.98, p < 0.001) and converters (t(424) = 5.77, p < 0.001)
compared to those with dementia but no difference between those scanned at CDR=0
(t(771) = 1.54, p = 0.125). Annual atrophy rates were calculated by subtracting the
baseline WBV from final scan WBV, dividing by number of years for this interval, and
multiplying by 100. Longitudinal analysis showed a group effect (F(2,501) = 8.06, p <
0.001, Figure 3b) with greater atrophy rates in those that entered with dementia (-2.01%
per year, SD = 2.15) and converters (-1.68% per year, SD = 1.91) compared to stable
controls (-1.13% per year, SD = 1.49; respectively (t(469) = 3.32, p < 0.001; (t(370) =
3.02, p = 0.002)) but no difference between those who had dementia at follow-up visits
(t(159) = 0.829, p = 0.41).
In PET imaging, PIB and Florbetapir (AV45) amyloid tracers have shown greater cortical
uptake in patients diagnosed with AD compared with control participants11,57. We
conducted a cursory review of amyloid deposition levels in each group using partial
volume corrected Centiloid values from PET scans. The longitudinal distribution of
amyloid deposition is presented in Figure 2b with amyloid positivity marked at a
Centiloid value of 16.4. As expected, the groups are significantly different (F(2,724) =
191.39 ; p < 0.001, Figure 3c) at the baseline scan. Those who entered the study with
dementia (defined as CDR > 0.5) had significantly higher amyloid levels than those who
later converted (t(229) = -8.08, p < 0.001) and stable controls (t(573) = -21.98, p <
0.001). Converters also had more amyloid as baseline scan compared to stable controls
(t(646) = -8.46, p < 0.001). Rate of amyloid deposition was calculated by dividing the
difference in baseline and last amyloid values by years to last follow-up PET scan.

There was no significant difference in rate of amyloid deposition for all three groups
(F(2,330) = 0.19 ; p > 0.05, Figure 3d).
OASIS-3 analyses show baseline amyloid deposition is correlated with later conversion
to dementia but baseline whole brain volume is not significantly related to later
conversion. The rate of change, however, is important for WBV but not for amyloid
deposition. The pattern of WBV change indicates that converters have WBV similar to
healthy controls however they have a steeper rate of decline and those that have
dementia at baseline have a steeper decline of WBV loss. This indicates that WBV loss
is a significant predictor of dementia in addition to the traditional analyses of smaller
volumes such as the hippocampal and parietal cortices. An important finding shows that
increased amyloid deposition levels precede measurable cognitive and clinical declines
in preclinical AD population. The early deposition patterns and atrophy rates support
early biomarker detection with intervention prior to observable declines in addition to
longitudinal follow-up for volume changes.
These exploratory analyses are representative of simple analyses that can be
conducted with the OASIS-3 data to describe factors related to cognitive decline.
However, multimodal models provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the
interaction of variables such as combining WBV atrophy rates and amyloid deposition
rates to predict cognitive decline patterns11,58–61. We provide OASIS-3 data for
investigators to explore changes across domains using alternate image processing
methods and advanced statistical approaches in an effort to predict healthy aging and
Alzheimer’s disease progression.

Data Usage
A standardized visit structure was not maintained across the duration of the data
collection. Investigators are instructed to use “days from entry” or “age at visit” to link
imaging and clinical visits. In order to provide the most complete dataset we did not
impose an association between visits. We have found that investigators vary on criterion
used to combine imaging and assessments into a visit, i.e. clinical assessment within 6
months of imaging visit. Additionally, there is no categorical variable that indicates if an
individual is healthy or has Alzheimer Disease as the investigators may choose to use
various biomarkers markers to identify early stages of decline before an individual is
symptomatic.
The published OASIS datasets – OASIS Cross-sectional, OASIS Longitudinal, and
OASIS-3 – contain overlapping participant data and should never be combined or
aggregated. It is recommended that investigators carefully consider which OASIS data
set best fits their needs and limit their research to that data set. Due to mandatory
anonymization procedures, links to subject data across datasets cannot be provided
and users of OASIS data are prohibited from attempting to link OASIS data.
