We investigated type 2 diabetes (T2D) genetic susceptibility in a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of 228,499

87

cases and 1,178,783 controls in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and other biobanks. We identified

88

558 autosomal and 10 X-chromosome T2D-associated variants, of which 286 autosomal and 7 X-

89

chromosome variants were previously unreported. Ancestry-specific analyses identified 25 additional

90

novel T2D-susceptibility variants. Transcriptome-wide association analysis detected 3,568 T2D-

91

associations with T2D-colocalized genetically predicted gene expression of 804 genes in 52 tissues, of

92

which 687 are novel. Fifty-four of these genes are known to interact with FDA-approved drugs and

93

chemical compounds. T2D polygenic risk score was strongly associated with increased the risk of T2D-

94

related retinopathy, and additionally showed evidence for association with chronic kidney disease

95

(CKD), neuropathy, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We investigated the genetic etiology of T2D-

96

related vascular outcomes in the MVP and observed statistical SNP-T2D interactions at 13 variants,

97

including 3 for coronary heart disease, 1 for PAD, 2 for stroke, 4 for retinopathy, 2 for CKD, and 1 for

98

neuropathy. Our findings may identify potential novel therapeutic targets for T2D and genomic

99

pathways that link T2D and its vascular outcomes.

101

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) - a leading cause of morbidity globally - is projected to affect up to 629

102

million people by 20451. People with T2D are at increased risk of developing a wide range of macro- and

103

microvascular outcomes2, and there are large disparities in prevalence, severity and co-morbidities

104

across global populations. T2D is highly polygenic and over 400 common variants have been identified

105

that confer disease susceptibility; however, most studies have been performed in European and Asian

106

ancestry populations, and dominant risk alleles in other ethnic groups remain to be discovered. The

107

genetic etiology of T2D-related sequelae remain poorly understood. Identifying genetic risks and critical

108

genes for T2D-related micro- and macrovascular disease could inform clinical management strategies,

109

including patient stratification and optimizing study design of randomized controlled trials for novel

110

treatments. The lack of large-scale multi-ethnic deeply phenotyped cohorts linked to genetic data has

111

made it difficult to address these questions.

112

We conducted a multi-ethnic association study of T2D risk comprised of 228,499 T2D cases and

113

1,178,783 controls of European, African American, Hispanic, South Asian, and East Asian ancestry. We

114

investigated the association of a T2D polygenic risk score with 3 major T2D-related macrovascular

115

outcomes (coronary heart disease [CHD], ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease [PAD]) and 3

116

microvascular disease (chronic kidney disease [CKD], retinopathy and neuropathy) in the Million Veteran

117

Program (MVP)3. We conducted a genome-wide SNP-T2D interaction analysis on vascular outcomes in

118

MVP to identify genetic variants where the effect of SNP on the vascular outcome depends on the

119

context of T2D presence. We also performed association analyses of genetically-predicted expression

120

levels and expression quantitative trait-T2D colocalization analyses to identify the effects of gene-tissue

121

pairs that influence T2D risk through inter-individual variation in expression.

122

This study differs from prior GWAS of T2D risk by leveraging large-scale clinical data in

123

conjunction with polygenic scores, extensive evaluation of context specificity for genetic effects on T2D

124

vascular sequelae and describing the regulatory circuits that influence T2D risk. These observations

128

Study Populations.

129

We performed a genome-wide, multi-ethnic T2D-association analysis (228,499 cases and 1,178,783

130

controls) encompassing five ancestral groups (Europeans, African Americans, Hispanics, South Asians

131

and East Asians) by meta-analyzing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics derived

132

from the Million Veteran Program (MVP)3 and other studies with non-overlapping participants:

133

DIAMANTE Consortium4, Penn Medicine Biobank5, Pakistan Genomic Resource6, Biobank Japan7, Malmö

134

Diet and Cancer Study8, Medstar9, and PennCath9 (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 1 and 3). MVP

135

participants (n = 273,409) are comprised predominantly of male subjects (91.6%) and were classified as

136

Europeans (72.1%), African Americans (19.5%), Hispanics (7.5%), and Asians (0.9%)(Supplemental Table

137

2).

138

Single-variant autosomal analyses.

139

We identified a total of 558 independent sentinel SNPs (286 novel, 272 previously reported)4,7,10,11

140

associated with T2D (Figure 1, Table 1, Supplemental Tables 4, 5, 6, 10, and 11, Supplemental Figure 1a-

141

e). Variants were classified as novel if they were at least 500 kb distant from a previously reported

142

sentinel SNP4,7,10,11 and/or if they were not in linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2 ≤ 0.05) with an established

143

sentinel SNP4,7,10,11. A total of 21 SNPs showed genome-wide significance in Europeans only

144

(Supplemental Table 6). We found that novel loci had, on average, smaller magnitudes of effect (0.032 ±

145

0.012 per allele) than previously established SNPs (0.054 ± 0.045 per allele, derived from data shown in

146

Supplementary Table 5), presumably resulting from enhanced power to discover weaker effects due to

147

the large sample size and ancestral diversity. Genome-wide chip heritability analysis explained 19% of

148

T2D risk4.

149

In an analysis of African American participants (Table 1), we observed a total of 21 loci

150

associated with T2D susceptibility at genome-wide significance, 16 of which were in strong LD with

151

established T2D variants. Three variants were novel and the effect on T2D appeared specific to African-

152

Americans. The frequency of the T2D risk-increasing allele is notably higher in African reference

153

populations than European for these SNPs, with the ancestral allele the major allele in African

154

populations and the derived allele being the major allele in European populations. Single variant analysis

155

in the Hispanics subset identified 2 SNPs, both of which tagged previously reported T2D loci

156

(Supplemental Table 10). No novel variants were observed in the subjects of Asian ancestry

157

(Supplemental Table 11).

158

Chromosome-X analyses.

159

A total of 10 association signals for T2D were identified on chromosome X in a multi-ethnic

160

meta-analysis, of which 7 were novel (Table 2a-b, Supplemental Figure 2a-e). A European-restricted

161

analysis identified 4 chromosome-X loci associated with T2D risk, all of which were identified in the

162

multi-ethnic meta-analysis. One novel chromosome-X locus was associated with T2D that is specific to

163

African Americans. Of interest is one novel, multi-ethnic locus near the androgen receptor gene that was

164

in strong LD with a previously reported variant (rs4509480) known to be associated with male-pattern

165

baldness (EUR r2=0.98, rs200644307).

166

Effect heterogeneity between Europeans and African Americans.

167

For most loci, we found no evidence of significant heterogeneity of effect estimates between Europeans

168

and African Americans, whereas 44 (7.9%) had significantly different effect estimates (Supplemental

169

Table 20). Overall, the strength of effect was found to be highest in Europeans, an expected result given

170

the abundance of individuals of that ancestry in our study. However, 4 loci nearby the genes SLC30A8,

171

PTPRQ, GRB10, and COLB showed higher effect sizes for T2D at stronger levels of significance in African

172

Americans compared with Europeans. Of these loci, associations with loss of function variants in the

173

SLC30A8 gene were previously reported in Europeans, African Americans and South Asians12,13.

174

Secondary signal analysis.

175

We detected a total of 233 conditionally independent SNPs that flank 49 novel and 108 previously

176

reported lead SNPs in Europeans (Supplementary Table 7 and 9), and identified 9 independent variants

177

in Europeans and 3 in African Americans flanking 3 novel and 6 previously reported sentinel SNPs. We

178

observed no novel conditionally independent variants in participants of South Asian, East Asian and

179

Hispanic ancestry.

180

Rare coding variant mapping.

181

To identify coding variants that may influence T2D risk by changing protein structures, we investigated

182

predicted loss of function (pLoF) and missense variants in LD with the identified T2D lead variants

183

(Supplementary Table 12). We identified 2 pLoF (LPL and ANKDD1B) and 45 missense variants in 47

184

genes that were in LD with at-least one of the T2D lead SNPs (r2 > 0.5, MVP reference panel in

185

Europeans) and were associated at a P-value < 1.0x10-4. We also identified 9 missense variants that were

186

either within 5 Mb of sentinel SNPs or in moderate to low LD (r2 < 0.5) and were associated with T2D at a

187

P-value < 1.0x10-4. Of the 56 pLoF and missense variants, 14 missense variants were found to be the

188

sentinel T2D SNPs and 19 variants were in LD with novel lead SNPs, and 37 variants were previously

189

reported.

190
191

We then performed a genome-wide screen of all pLoF’s (not bound by proximity to sentinel T2D
lead variants) and missense variants available for analysis (Supplemental Table 13) and identified one

192

additional pLoF variant in the CCHCR1 gene, whereas 37 novel missense variants were associated with

193

T2D at a P-value threshold of 5x10-8.

194

Rare coding variant PheWAS.

195

To understand biological pleiotropy and underlying mechanisms, we performed a PheWAS of the 3 pLoF

196

variants associated with T2D in MVP participants of European ancestry (Table 5). These loci included

197

ANKDD1B p.Trp480*, CCHCR1 p.Trp78*, and LPL p.*474Ser in the MVP, and were significantly associated

198

with metabolic and inflammatory conditions. For example, ANKDD1B p.Trp480* was associated with

199

dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetic neurological manifestations. CCHCR1 p.Trp78* was

200

associated with type 1 diabetes, epistaxis, celiac disease, microscopic hematuria, and psoriatic

201

arthropathy. Finally, the recent report by Klarin et al. includes a Phewas of LPL p.*474Ser in MVP14,

202

which was associated with dyslipidemia, coronary atherosclerosis and other chronic ischemic heart

203

disease.

204

Transcriptome-wide association analyses.

205

Common variants from the European T2D GWAS meta-analysis were used to evaluate the association of

206

genetically predicted gene expression levels with T2D risk across 52 tissues including kidney and islet

207

cells using S-PrediXcan15 (Supplemental Table 8, Supplemental Figure 3). We identified 4,468 statistically

208

significant gene-tissue combination pairs genetically predictive of T2D risk, of which 4,211 transcript

209

eQTLs were in LD (r2 > 0.5) with T2D signals. We identified 873 genes in this analysis that would not have

210

been identified by nearest-gene annotation alone. The strongest gene-tissue combination signals were

211

for NRAP in the cerebellum and TCF7L2 in the aortic artery.

212

We additionally used COLOC to identify the subset of significant genes where there was a high

213

posterior probability that the set of model SNPs in the S-PrediXcan analysis for each gene were both

214

causal for the expression and T2D. This analysis refined the results of the TWAS and excluded some

215

results that might be the consequence of LD between causal SNPs for gene expression and T2D. We

216

detected 3,568 gene-tissue pairs where there was statistically significant association with T2D risk and

217

high posterior probability (P4>0.5) of colocalization. The colocalized and significant results included 804

218

genes. When comparing the 804 genes to the GWAS catalog mapped and reported genes for all prior

219

studies of diabetes or diabetes complications, 687 had not been identified previously.

220

Hypergeometric enrichment analysis showed that most enriched gene expression signals were

221

in the following tissues: cervical spinal cord, basal ganglia, glomerular kidney, tibial nerve, transformed

222

fibroblasts, and skeletal muscle (Supplemental Table 15). A cross-section of the putative genes identified

223

through transcriptome-wide analysis and the genes identified from the genome-wide coding variant

224

lookup (Supplemental Table 12) identified the genes: PCNT p.Ile539Thr, NMI p.Leu16Ser, TRIM66

225

p.His322Arg, STARD3 p.Gln117Arg, and ZNF641 p.Gln363Pro.

226

Assessment of gene–drug relationships.

227

Of the 991 genes identified in S-PrediXcan analyses, 54 genes have documented interactions with a total

228

of 283 FDA-approved drugs and chemical compounds that do not have an indication for T2D treatment

229

or reported ADE in diabetic patients using the SIDER database of drugs and side effects16. Using the

230

Drug-Gene Interaction Database17 (DGIdb version 3.0) a total of 322 gene-drug combinations were

231

identified for which it is predicted that they would lower blood glucose based on direction of effect on

232

T2D risk with increasing gene expression and drug action (activator or inhibitor)(Supplemental Table 14).

233

Gene-drug combinations included several established T2D loci including KCNJ11 targeted by 15

234

compounds (e.g. sulfonylureas, glinides, and p-glycoprotein inhibitors), SCNA3 targeted by 57

235

compounds (e.g. anti-arrythmetics, anti-epileptics), PIK3CB targeted by 46 compounds (e.g. cancer

236

drugs), ACE targeted by 36 compounds (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), HMGCR

237

targeted by 18 compounds (e.g. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), PIK3C2A targeted by 15 compounds

(anti-cancer drugs), F2 targeted by 11 compounds (anti-coagulants), and BLK targeted by 9 compounds

The gene most significant in S-PrediXcan targeted by a non-antiglycemic medication was PPARG

241

in EBV-transformed lymphocytes (Supplemental Table 8). The gene most significant in S-PrediXcan

242

targeted by a drug with report of ADE in diabetic patients was TH in non-sun-exposed suprapubic skin.

The gene most significant in S-PrediXcan targeted by an established anti-glycemic medication was

244

KCNJ11 in sun-exposed skin from the lower leg.

Pathway and functional enrichment analysis.

246

To explore whether our results recapitulate the pathophysiology of T2D, we performed gene-set

247

enrichment analysis with all the variants using DEPICT (P < 1x10-5, Supplemental Table 16). MeSH-based

248

analysis showed that several different adipose tissues and sites were enriched (abdominal subcutaneous

249

fat, abdominal fat, adipose tissue, subcutaneous fat, and white adipose tissue). Finally, DEPICT analysis

250

showed that the most significant gene-set involved the AKT2 subnetwork, lung cancer, the GAB1

251

signalosome, protein kinase binding, signal transduction, and EGFR signaling (Supplemental Table 17).

252

Genetic correlation between T2D and other phenotypes.

253

Genome-wide genetic correlations of T2D were calculated with a total of 774 complex traits and

254

diseases by comparing allelic effects using LD score regression (Online Methods). A total of 270

255

significant associations were observed (P < 5.0x10-8, Supplementary Table 19). The strongest positive

256

correlations were observed with waist circumference, overall health, BMI, and fat mass of arms, legs,

257

body and trunk, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, alcohol intake, years of education,

258

wheezing, and cigarette smoking. There was also a strong negative correlation with years of education.

T2D-related micro- and macrovascular outcomes.

261

Using a genome-wide approach, we investigated SNP-T2D interaction effects associated with T2D-

262

related vascular outcomes among European-descent MVP participants (P < 5x10-8, Online Methods,

263

Table 3a-b). The analysis included a total case count of 67,403 for CKD, 56,285 for CHD, 35,882 for PAD,

264

11,796 for acute ischemic stroke, 13,881 for retinopathy, and 40,475 for neuropathy. Several genome-

265

wide significant interactions were identified where the genetic associations with T2D-related vascular

266

outcomes were modified by T2D (Table 3a-b). We identified 2 loci for CHD (rs1831733 in 9p21 and

267

rs602633 near SORT1) and 1 for CKD (rs34857077 in UMOD) for which the difference in the effect

268

estimates between T2D strata was genome-wide significant (P < 5.0x10-08) and at least one T2D-stratum

269

was genome-wide significant as well. We additionally identified 1 locus for CHD (rs71039916 near

270

PDE3A), 1 for CKD (rs2177223 near TENM3), 1 for PAD (rs3104154 in PTDSS1), 1 for neuropathy

271

(rs78977169 near NRP2), 4 for retinopathy (rs76754787 nearby GJA8, rs10733997 in SVILP2, rs2255624

272

near SLC18A2, and rs4132670 in TCF7L2) and 2 for acute ischemic stroke (rs491203 near TMEM51, and

273

rs2134937 near TRIQK) that showed a genome-wide significance for difference in effect estimates

274

between the T2D strata and nominal significance (P < 0.001) for at least one T2D stratum.

275

Polygenic risk scores and T2D-related micro- and macrovascular outcomes

276

Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (gPRS) for T2D were calculated in Europeans based on the T2D effect

277

estimates from the previously reported DIAMANTE consortium4 and then categorized into deciles (Table

278

4a-b). As expected, participants with the highest T2D gPRS scores (90-100% T2D gPRS percentile)

279

showed the highest risk for T2D (OR = 5.21, 95% CI 4.94-5.49, Supplemental Figure 5) when compared to

280

the reference group (0-10% T2D gPRS percentile) in a cross-sectional study design.

281

We evaluated whether the T2D gPRS was associated with the risk of micro- and macrovascular

282

outcomes in an analysis restricted to participants with T2D. The P-value are calculated using gPRS as a

283

continuous exposure and odds ratios are shown by contrasting the top to the bottom gPRS decile (Figure

284

2 and Table 4a-b). The T2D gPRS was more strongly associated with microvascular than macrovascular

285

outcomes, in particular with retinopathy, but also with neuropathy and CKD. For macrovascular

286

outcomes, T2D gPRS was associated with the risk of PAD, but not with the risk of CHD or acute ischemic

287

stroke.

288

Discussion

289

We report the discovery of 318 novel autosomal and X-chromosome variants associated with T2D

290

susceptibility in a large multi-ethnic T2D study. Furthermore, we observed 13 variants associated with

291

differences in T2D-related micro- and macrovascular outcomes between diabetic and non-diabetics. The

292

substantial locus discovery was achieved by combining data from several large-scale biobanks and

293

consortia, where the MVP data constituted over 40% of all T2D cases. Furthermore, we present the

294

largest cohort of African Americans including over 56K subjects, substantially greater than any African-

295

specific T2D study published to date.

296

Analyses of coding variants identified 44 variants for T2D, including three pLoF variants in LPL,

297

ANKDD1B and CCHCR1. 804 putative causal genes at both novel and previously reported loci were

298

identified and 54 genes were found to be possible targets for FDA-approved drugs and chemical

299

compounds. Our SNP-T2D interaction analyses identified several loci where the association between a

300

genetic variant and a vascular outcome differed between people with T2D as compared to those

301

without. We further found that a high polygenic risk for T2D strongly increased the risk for retinopathy

302

in patients with T2D, and also for CKD, neuropathy, and PAD.

303

T2D is highly prevalent in people of African ancestry; however there are a total of three

304

published T2D GWAS reports in this ancestral group with only 4 definitely detected loci18,19,20. In our

305

study with over 56K participants of recent African ancestry, we report 4 novel loci for T2D that are solely

306

observed in this ancestral group, including one that is located on chromosome X. Of the previously

307

reported loci, only rs3842770 (INS-IGF2) was replicated here. The reported HLA-B variant rs224402018

308

did not replicate in our study; but we did observe a significant association with another SNP in the HLA

309

region (rs10305420, OR 1.15, P = 8.5x10-9). We did not replicate the association with the variant

310

rs756016320. Finally, 1 locus (rs73284431) that was recently identified in a large study conducted in Sub-

311

Saharan African countries19 failed to replicate in our study consisting of African Americans despite

312

comparable minor allele frequencies (9% vs 10%). Finally, we observed that one SLC30A8 variant

313

showed a very prominent T2D effect in African Americans that was absent in other populations; mouse

314

studies have shown that the human R138X LoF variant in SLC30A8 results in increased insulin secretory

315

capacity21.

316

The sole presence of a coding variant near a tagging SNP does not constitute enough evidence

317

to infer a causal association. However, recent exome-array genotyping of over 350K subjects identified

318

40 coding variants associated with T2D, of which 26 mapped to near known risk-associated loci22.

319

Similarly, an exome sequencing study in over 40K participants reported 15 variants associated with T2D,

320

of which only 2 were not previously reported by GWAS13. Sequencing efforts are indispensable for

321

identifying causal variants and genes related to disease, as well as providing insight into the

322

contributions of ultra-rare alleles, but have also substantiated the value of array-based association

323

studies.

324

Our transcriptome-wide analyses identified 804 putatively causal genes, including 54 genes that

325

appear to be regulated by approved drugs and 687 genes that have not been previously reported. Some

326

of these genes are already well established for T2D etiology (e.g. KCNJ11). Except for skeletal muscle,

327

the tissues that showed strongest associations are not known to be of importance in T2D etiology. This

328

raises the hypothesis that the eQTL associations are universal and not tissue dependent; if the gene is

329

expressed in the respective tissue at reasonable levels an association will be detected. We did not

330

observe any significant association in the alpha and beta islet cells, which could be the result of the small

331

sample size (e.g. 30 alpha cells and 19 beta cells). In addition, whole islet transcriptomes are notoriously

332

variable due to the large differences in islet composition among humans, and a few transcripts make up

333

half the transcriptome23.

334

Of particular clinical importance, we identified several genes which are therapeutic targets for

335

medications in patients that are treated for cardiometabolic conditions. We identified two genes, SCN3A

336

and SV2A whose expression is modified by anti-epileptic agents, and evidence exists showing that anti-

337

epileptic agents may influence glucose regulation. A randomized-controlled trial has reported that the

338

anticonvulsant valproic acid lowers blood glucose concentrations24. The information from the gene-drug

339

screen may facilitate future drug repurposing screens.

340

DEPICT enrichment analysis identified AKT2 subnetwork gene set to be show the highest

341

association with T2D. Of interest is that AKT2 is critical to insulin signaling and not beta-cell function.

342

The majority of the early era T2D GWAS studies25 predominantly identified genetic variants that alter

343

T2D risk through reduced beta-cell function, such as KCNJ11, HHEX, SLC30A8, CDKAL1, TCF7L2,

344

CDKN2A/2B, and IGF2BP2. However, as the study sample size have substantially increased and the

345

number of T2D-associated variants is approaching the 1.000 number mark, the cumulative effect of

346

genetic variants on T2D is pointing towards a predominant role for insulin resistance.

347

When we evaluated polygenic risk scores and T2D-related outcomes, we observed that among

348

vascular outcomes, the T2D gPRS was most significantly associated with retinopathy. It is possible that

349

the use of the T2D gPRS provides an opportunity to identify patients who are at the highest risk of

350

developing microvascular complications, such as retinopathy. Using the T2D gPRS, we observed

351

significant associations with other T2D-related outcomes such as CKD, PAD, and neuropathy. Studies at

352

specific loci using both common and rare coding variants will be required to understand pathways

353

leading to T2D-related vascular outcomes.

354

In a SNP-T2D interactions analysis on T2D-related vascular outcomes we identified 13 loci where

355

the effect on outcome was different between the strata of T2D, of which 3 occurred at previously

356

established variants and 10 had not been previously reported. Our findings have clinical translational

357

potential for risk-stratification and identify diabetic patients who are predisposed to develop

358

subsequent vascular outcomes and present therapeutic opportunities to attenuate the risk of diabetes

359

progression in individuals with T2D.

360

For T2D-related retinopathy, four variants were found to have different effect sizes between

361

people with and without T2D. The strongest signal for interaction in relation to retinopathy was

362

observed for GJA8. Deletion of this gene has been associated with eye abnormalities and retinopathy of

363

prematurity in premature infants, inherited cataracts, visual impairment and cardiac defects and eye

364

abnormalities26-28. TCF7L2 is a known diabetes locus and its association with progression to retinopathy

365

has been previously established29. SLC18A2 is expressed in adult retina and retinal pigment epithelium

366

tissues30; this gene is involved in the transport of monoamines into secretory vesicles for exocytosis31.

367

SVILP1 has been previously shown to be associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) prescription, which is

368

frequently prescribed to people with blurry vision32.

369

For chronic kidney disease, two loci, UMOD and TENM3, were identified for gene-T2D

370

interaction effects. UMOD encodes for uromodilin which is exclusively produced by the kidney tubule

371

where it plays an important role in kidney and urine function33. A large-scale study in over 133K

372

participants has shown that the serum creatinine-lowering allele in UMOD (rs12917707) is more

373

prevalent in diabetic individuals with CKD as compared to diabetic participants without CKD34. Variation

374

in TENM3 has been associated with cholangitis and kidney disorders in the UK Biobank 35.

375

SNP-T2D interaction analysis of neuropathy identified one locus, NRP2. NRP2 encodes for

376

neuropilin-2 which is an essential cell surface receptor involved in VEGF-dependent angiogenesis and

377

sensory nerve regeneration36,37.

378

For coronary heart disease, we identified several SNP-T2D interactions. Variation at 9p21 has

379

been reported previously for CHD and T2D. SORT1 is a lipid-associated locus; in our analyses, allelic

380

variation at this locus that decreases CHD risk and decreases lipids conferred a stronger protection in

381

people with T2D compared to those without T2D. Coupled with findings in mice that identified SORT1 as

382

a novel target of insulin signaling38, our findings raise the hypothesis that SORT1 may contribute to

383

altered hepatic apoB metabolism under insulin-resistant conditions.

384

The SNP rs71039916 is located nearby PDE3A, and collocates with a SNP (rs3752728, D’ = 0.867,

385

r2 = 0.08) that is associated with diastolic blood pressure39,40. As a phosphodiesterase that reduces cAMP

386

levels, the PDE3A protein limits protein kinase A/cAMP signaling, and has been shown to affect

387

proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells41. Cell line research has shown that cAMP levels might

388

impact the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells42, and more recent gene ablation studies

389

in mice have established that cAMP/CREB signaling controls the insulinotropic and anti-apoptotic effects

390

of GLP-1 signaling in adult mouse β-cells43. Subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients with T2D show

391

increased PDE activity, and inverse correlations between total PDE3 activity and BMI have been

392

reported in adipocytes44.

393

We have conducted the largest discovery study for T2D to date, including over 220K T2D cases

394

and 1.2 million controls. Over 21% of our discovery sample comprised of non-European participants; our

395

African American sample included over 56K subjects. A unique strength in our study is the

396

comprehensive individual level phenotype data available for analyzing T2D and related micro- and

397

macrovascular outcomes. This allowed us to test for genetic interaction instead of evaluating effect

398

differences between strata using summary statistics.

399

In summary, we have identified 318 novel genetic variants associated with T2D risk and T2D-

400

related vascular outcomes, including 3 population-specific autosomal loci in African Americans, 8

401

chromosome-X variants, plus an additional 13 variants associated with differences in T2D-related micro-

402

and macrovascular outcomes across diabetic stratum. Coding variant analyses and transcriptome wide

403

analyses have identified many putative causal genes that could be pursued in functional mechanistic

404

studies and provide an updated map of effects for gene-tissue pairs for T2D risk. Our gene-drug analyses

405

provide a genetic basis to guide future drug repurposing studies. Lastly, our SNP-T2D interaction

406

analyses elucidate differences in pathogenetic mechanisms of T2D-related vascular outcomes with

407

potential clinical implications for preventing development of microvascular complications in T2D.

Online Methods

410

We conducted a large-scale multi-ethnic autosomal and X-chromosome T2D GWAS of common variants

411

in over 1.4 million participants. We subsequently conducted analyses to facilitate the prioritization of

412

these individual findings, including transcriptome-wide predicted gene expression for T2D, secondary

413

signal analysis, T2D-related vascular outcomes analysis using SNP-T2D interaction analysis, coding

414

variant mapping, phenome-wide association analyses of pLoF variants, and a drug repurposing screen.

Discovery cohort.

416

The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a large cohort of fully consented veterans of the United States

417

military forces recruited from 63 participating Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities3.

418

Recruitment started in 2011, and all veterans were eligible for participation. Compared with the general

419

population, the Million Veteran Program is overrepresented with participants of male gender, but the

420

study is representative of the US population in terms of race and ethnicity. This study analyzed clinical

421

data through July 2017 for participants who enrolled between January 2011 and October 2016. Across

422

ancestries, the average age at study enrollment ranged from 56.1 for Asian to 68.2 for European

423

participants (Supplementary Table 3). Average body mass index (BMI) ranged from 28.5 for Asians to

424

30.8 for African Americans. The proportion of males ranged from 87.2% for African Americans to 93.9%

425

for Asians. The prevalence of T2D was 35.5% for Europeans, 36.4% for Asians, 42.1% for Hispanics, and

426

43.6% for African Americans. All MVP study participants provided blood samples for DNA extraction and

427

genotyping, and completed surveys about their health, lifestyle, and military experiences. Consent to

428

participate and permission to re-contact was provided after counseling by research staff and mailing of

429

informational materials. Study participation includes consenting to access to the participant’s electronic

430

health records for research purposes, data that captures a median follow-up time of 10.0 years at time

431

of study enrollment. Each veteran’s electronic health care record is integrated into the MVP

432

biorepository, including inpatient International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM)

diagnosis codes, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) procedure codes, clinical laboratory

434

measurements, and reports of diagnostic imaging modalities. Researchers are provided data that is de-

435

identified except for dates, and do not have the ability or authorization to link these details with a

436

participant’s identity. Blood samples are collected by phlebotomists and banked at the VA Central

437

Biorepository in Boston, where DNA is extracted and shipped to two external centers for genotyping.

438

The Million Veteran Program received ethical and study protocol approval from the VA Central

439

Institutional Review Board (cIRB) in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of

440

Helsinki.

441

Genotyping: DNA extracted from buffy coat was genotyped using a custom Affymetrix Axiom biobank

442

array. The MVP 1.0 genotyping array contains a total of 723,305 SNPs, enriched for 1) low frequency

443

variants in African and Hispanic populations, and 2) variants associated with diseases common to the VA

444

population3.

445

Genotype quality-control: The MVP genomics working group applied standard quality control and

446

genotype calling algorithms to the data in two batches using the Affymetrix Power Tools Suite (v1.18).

447

Standard quality control pipelines were used to exclude duplicate samples, samples with more

448

heterozygosity than expected, samples with an excess (> 2.5%) of missing genotype calls and samples

449

with discordance of genetically inferred sex versus self-report. We excluded related individuals (halfway

450

between second- and third-degree relatives or closer) as measured by the KING software45. Before

451

imputation, variants that were poorly called or that deviated from their expected allele frequency based

452

on reference data from the 1000 Genomes Project were excluded 46. After prephasing using EAGLE v247,

453

genotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3, version 5 reference panel were imputed into MVP

454

participants via Minimac3 software48. The top 30 principal components were computed using FlashPCA49

455

on a genotype dataset that included all MVP participants and an additional 2,504 individuals from 1000

456

Genomes. These 30 PCs were then used for the unification of self-reported race/ancestry and

457

genetically inferred ancestry to compose ancestral groups used for stratification in subsequent

458

association analyses50.

459

Race and ethnicity: Information on race (Europeans, African Americans, Asians and Native Americans)

460

and ethnicity (Hispanic, yes or no) was obtained based on self-report through centralized VA data

461

collection methods using standardized survey forms, or through the use of information from the VA

462

Corporate Data Warehouse or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership data, when information

463

from self-report survey was missing. Even though self-reported race/ethnicity was missing in 3.67% of

464

study participants, 39.4% of participants had some form of discordant information between the various

465

sources of which the data was extracted. Race and ethnicity categories were merged to form the

466

following race or ancestral groups: Europeans, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians using a unifying

467

classification algorithm based on self-identified race/ethnicity and genetically inferred ancestral

468

information, termed HARE (Harmonized Ancestry and Race/Ethnicity)50. Using this approach, of the total

469

of 351,820 genotyped individuals all but 6,257 (1.78%) were assigned to one of the four ancestral

470

groups.

471

Phenotype classification: ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes from electronic health care records were available

472

for MVP participants from as early as 1998. Participants were classified as a T2D case if they had 2 or

473

more T2D-related diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM 250.2x) from VA or fee basis inpatient stays or face-to-face

474

primary care outpatient visits in the 731 days before the enrollment date up to July 1st of 2017,

475

excluding those with co-occurring diagnosis codes for T1D (250.1x), secondary or other diabetes or a

476

medical condition that may cause diabetes (249.xx). Participants were selected as controls if they had no

477

ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for type 1, type 2, or secondary diabetes mellitus up to July 2017.

478

For T2D-related vascular outcomes, the following definitions were used: CHD, at least one admission to

encounters. Subjects were classified as having PAD if they had at least two of ICD-9-CM codes or CPT

483

codes as outlined in the report of Klarin et al.14, or having one code and at least two visits to a vascular

484

surgeon within a 14 month period. Acute ischemic stroke was defined if at least 1 ICD-9-CM discharge

485

diagnosis code for stroke excluding head injury or rehab (433.x1, 434 [excluding 434.x0], and 436) was

486

present51. CKD was classified as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min−1·1.73 m−2 on 2

487

separate measurements 90 days apart, or ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for chronic renal failure (585)

488

and/or a history of kidney transplantation (ICD-9-CM V42)52; Neuropathy was defined using the

489

following ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes: diabetic neuropathy (356.9, 250.6), amyotrophy (358.1), cranial

490

nerve palsy (951.0, 951.1, 951.3), mono-neuropathy (354.0-355.9), Charcot's arthropathy (713.5),

491

polyneuropathy (357.2), neurogenic bladder (596.54), autonomic neuropathy (337.0, 337.1), orthostatic

492

hypotension (458). Retinopathy was defined using ICD-9-DM diagnosis codes for: T2D with ophthalmic

493

manifestations (250.50, 250.52), retinal detachments and defects (361.0, 361.1), disorders of vitreous

494

body (379.2), other retinal disorders (362.0, 362.1, 362.3, 362.81, 362.83, 362.84), excluding ICD-9-CM

495

codes associated with macular degeneration (362.5).

496

MVP analysis: We tested imputed SNPs that passed quality control (e.g. HWE > 1.0x10-10, INFO > 0.3, call

497

rate > 0.975) for association with T2D through logistic regression assuming an additive model of variants

498

with MAF > 0.1% in Europeans, and MAF > 1% in African Americans, Hispanics and Asians using PLINK2a

499

software53. Covariates included age, gender, and 10 principal components of genetic ancestry.

500

Other studies: Summary statistics available from previous reports in the DIAMANTE Consortium4,

501

Biobank Japan7, Penn Medicine Biobank5, Malmö Diet and Cancer Study8, MedStar/PennCath studies9,

502

and the Pakistani Genomic Resource6 were obtained for meta-analysis (Supplemental Table 2). All

505

Consortium reference panel54. Briefly, following central and study-specific quality control protocols, an

506

additional 917,392 Europeans, 2,647 African Americans, and 213,834 Asians were available for T2D

507

meta-analysis. Only SNPs with ancestry-specific MAF > 1% in these studies were used. Within each study

508

a logistic regression model was used where T2D was set as the dependent variable, imputed SNP as the

509

independent variable, and analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and the top ten principal

510

components of genetic ancestry.

511

Meta-analysis: We aggregated association summary statistics from the above mentioned studies to

512

perform ancestry-specific and multi-ethnic meta-analysis. The association summary statistics for each

513

analysis were meta-analyzed in a fixed-effects model using METAL with inverse-variance weighting of

514

log odds ratios55. From the meta-analysis, all variants were extracted that passed quality control.

515

Between-study allelic effect size heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran’s Q statistic as implemented

516

in METAL. Variants were considered genome-wide significant if they passed the conventional p-value

517

threshold of 5.0x10-8. We excluded variants with a high amount of heterogeneity (I2 statistic > 75%)

518

across the four evaluated ancestral groups.

519

Novel loci: Novel loci were defined as those in which the lead variant was not in LD or physically nearby

520

(500 Kb) to a previously reported lead GWAS variant(s). For each locus, we first searched ± 500 Kb

521

surrounding the lead SNP to ensure that potential long-range genetic influences were assessed.

522

Chromosome-X analysis: X chromosome genotypes were processed separately from autosomal

523

genotypes. During prephasing and imputation an additional flag of -chrX was added. In post-imputation

524

stage, the XWAS QC pipeline was employed to remove variants in the pseudo-autosomal regions,

525

variants that were not in HWE in females (P > 1.0x10-6), variants with differential allele frequencies, and

526

variants with differential missingness (p<10−7) between males and female controls (Supplemental

527

Figure 2)56. For each ancestry-specific subset, we performed sex-stratified analysis where dosages

528

(number of chromosome copies) for the X-chromosome in T2D cases are equivalent to controls within

529

each sex stratum. For the meta-analysis of sexes, differences in dosage compensation should be

530

considered between males (with one X chromosome) and females (with two X chromosomes). In a

531

separate verification analysis we performed a chromosome-X association analysis on dosage data using

532

PLINK (--xchr-model) which produced consistent results compared with analysis of best-guess data

533

where the X chromosome was coded as 0/2 for males instead of 0/1. The output from sex-stratified

534

chromosome-X analyses were first meta-analyzed into a multi-ethnic sex-stratified analysis. Then, the

535

multi-ethnic results from males and multi-ethnic results from females were meta-analyzed, where none

536

of the analyzed variants was detected using the Cochrane test for heterogeneity (P < 5.0x10-8). Results

537

presented include overall effect estimates, male-specific effect estimates, female-specific estimates, and

538

the heterogeneity p-value (Supplementary Table 13).

539

Secondary signal analysis.

540

GCTA57 was used to conduct conditional analyses to detect ancestry-specific distinct association signals

541

at each of the lead SNPs utilizing the meta-analyzed GWAS summary statistics in Europeans and African

542

Americans. Race-stratified MVP cohorts (197,066 Europeans and 53,445 African Americans) were used

543

to model LD patterns between variants. The reference panel of genotypes consisted of the variants with

544

allele frequencies > 0.1% in Europeans and >1% in African Americans that passed quality control criteria

545

in the MVP-specific T2D GWAS (INFO > 0.3, HWE P > 1.0x10-10, call rate > 0.975). For each lead SNP,

546

conditionally independent variants that reached locus-wide significance (P < 1.0x10-5) were considered

547

as secondary signals of distinct association. If the minimum distance between any distinct signals from

548

two separate loci was less than 500 Kb, we performed additional conditional analysis including both

549

regions and reassessed the independence of each signal. Finally, the predicted conditionally

550

independent variants were tested in a logistic regression model in the MVP study only to empirically

551

validate the signal, and results are shown in Supplemental Tables 7 and 10.

552

Coding variant mapping.

553

All imputed variants in MVP were evaluated with Ensemble variant effect predictor58, and all predicted

554

LoF and missense variants were extracted. The LD was calculated with established variants, and in a

555

second round of analysis the effect of the missense variant was calculated conditioning on the lead SNP

556

to assess how much residual variance the SNP explains in T2D risk. A p-value of 0.05 was considered as

557

statistically significant.

558

S-PrediXcan and colocalization analyses.

559

Genetically predicted gene expression and its association with T2D risk was estimated using S-

560

PrediXcan15. Input included meta-analyzed summary statistics from the European T2D GWAS for

561

common variants and reference eQTL summary statistics for 52 tissues including 48 tissues from GTEx59,

562

2 cell types in kidney tissue (glomerulus and tubulus)60, and 2 cell types in pancreatic islet tissue (alpha

563

and beta)61. Analyses incorporated genotype covariance matrices based on 1000 Genomes46 European

564

populations to account for LD structure. Colocalization analysis was performed to address the issue of

565

LD-contamination in S-PrediXcan analyses62. Input data were identical to those evaluated by S-PrediXcan

566

and colocalization was restricted to only variants included in the S-PrediXcan gene63. The output is

567

shown in Supplemental Table 8.

568

Phenotypic variance explained by SNPs.

569

The MVP European cohort (69,869 T2D cases and 127,197 controls) was used to calculate the variance

570

explained by the 558 genome-wide-significant sentinel SNPs from the multi-ethnic meta-analysis. A

571

logistic regression model was performed assuming additive effects where T2D was set as the dependent

572

variable, and the sentinel SNPs as independent variables, adjusting for sex, age, and 10 principal

573

components. The baseline model included age, gender and 10 principal components. The variance

574

explained was calculated with the R2 statistic, calculated as 1 – (residual deviance / null deviance).

575

Phenome-wide association analysis.

576

For the three LoF variants that were identified using coding variant analysis, we performed a PheWAS

577

study64 to fully leverage the diverse nature of the Million Veteran Program as well as the full catalog of

578

relevant ICD-9-CM diagnosis and CPT procedure codes (Supplementary Table 18). Of genotyped

579

veterans, participants were included in the PheWAS analysis if their respective electronic health record

580

reflected two or more separate encounters in the VA Healthcare System in each of the two years prior

581

to enrollment in MVP. Using this method, a total of 277,531 veterans spanning 21,209,658 available ICD-

582

9 diagnosis codes were available for PheWAS analysis. We restricted our analysis on the subgroup of

583

197,066 European participants. Diagnosis and procedure codes were collapsed to clinical disease groups

584

and corresponding controls using predefined groupings65. Phenotypes were required to have a case

585

count over 25 in order to be included in the PheWAS analysis, and a multiple testing thresholds for

586

statistical significance was set to P < 2.8x10-5 (Bonferroni method). Each of the previously unpublished

587

LoF variants (ANKDD1B p.Trp480* and CCHCR1 p.Trp78*) were tested using logistic regression adjusting

588

for age, sex, and 10 principal components in an additive effects model using the PheWAS R package in R

589

v3.2.066. The results from these analyses are reported as odds ratios, in which the estimate is the

590

average change in odds of the PheWAS trait per weighted T2D-increasing allele (Supplementary Table

591

18, Supplementary Figure 4).

592

Analysis of T2D-related outcomes.

593

Genetic data on European participants was separately analyzed using outcomes as a binary outcome,

594

and T2D as an interaction variable with SNPs using interaction analysis with robust variance to reduce

595

effect heteroscedacity (e.g. unequal variance between strata) using SUGEN software (v8.8)67. We

596

evaluated the interaction between SNP and presence of T2D status using an interaction term for the two

597

independent variables. Due to the binary nature of the outcome, the standard output from the

27

598

interaction effect estimate are interpreted on a multiplicative scale, e.g., the departure from the

599

product of the two independent effects. To obtain interaction on an additive scale (e.g. departure from

600

the sum of the independent effects), we calculated the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI)

601

metric, a well-known analytic method in classic epidemiologic literature68. In case-control studies using

602

the linear additive odds-ratio model as proposed by Richardson and Kaufman68 in our study has the form

603

of:
𝑂𝑑𝑑𝑠 = 𝑒 𝛽0 (1 + 𝛽1 ∙ 𝑆𝑁𝑃 + 𝛽2 ∙ 𝑇2𝐷 + 𝛽3 ∙ 𝑆𝑁𝑃 ∙ 𝑇2𝐷)

604
605

In which the coefficient 𝛽3 measures the departure from additivity of exposure effect on an odds ratio

̅̅̅̅̅̅ ) + 1

608

̅̅̅̅̅̅and 𝑇2𝐷
̅̅̅̅̅̅ note the absence of the respective covariates.
where 𝑆𝑁𝑃

609

In contrast to the standard exponential odds model, where the effects of explanatory variables are

610

additive on an exponential scale, we performed analysis using a linear odds model, in order to quantify

611

the excess odds per unit of the given explanatory variables on the outcome. In this model, the excess

612

relative risk due to interaction is an estimate of the excess odds on a linear scale due to the interaction

613

between two explanatory variables (in our case, T2D state and genotype dosage of the tested variant).

614

In the SNPxT2D interaction analysis we used a significance threshold of P < 5.0x10-08 to denote variants

615

that statistically different effect sizes between participants with T2D as compared those without. An

616

additional filter was applied, and variants for which the effect size in at least one of the two T2D strata

617

was nominally significant at P < 0.001 were included. Manhattan plots and the table are used to

618

represent the interaction coefficients on this scale.

620

Polygenic risk scores and risk of T2D and related outcomes.

621

We constructed a genome-wide polygenic risk score (gPRS) for T2D in the MVP participants of European

622

ancestry by calculating a linear combination of weights derived from the Europeans in the DIAMANTE

623

Consortium4 using the prune and threshold method in PRSice software69. After an initial sensitivity

624

analysis, the r2 threshold for pruning was set to 0.8, and the P-value for significance threshold was set to

625

0.05. The gPRSs were divided into deciles and the risk of T2D was assessed using a logistic regression

626

model using the lowest decile as a reference (e.g. the 10% of participants with lowest of T2D gPRS),

627

together with the potential confounding factors of age, gender, BMI, and the first 10 principal

628

components of European ancestry. An additional outcomes analysis was performed to evaluate to what

629

extent a T2D gPRS is predictive of T2D-induced morbidities. The dataset was restricted to subjects with

630

T2D, and a stratum-restricted T2D gPRS deciles were generated. Logistic regression models were applied

631

where the micro- and macrovascular conditions were modeled as outcomes, and independent variables

632

included strata-restricted gPRS deciles, age, gender, and the first 10 principal components of European

633

ancestry. The data were visualized using shape-plots.

634

Heritability estimates and genetic correlations with other complex traits and diseases.

635

LD-score regression was used to estimate the heritability coefficient, and subsequently population and

636

sample prevalence estimates were applied to estimate heritability on the liability scale70. A genome-

637

wide genetic correlation analysis was performed to investigate possible co-regulation or a shared

638

genetic basis between T2D and other complex traits and diseases. Pairwise genetic correlation

639

coefficients were estimated between the meta-analyzed T2D GWAS summary output in Europeans and

640

each of 774 precomputed and publicly available GWAS summary statistics for complex traits and

641

diseases by using LD score regression through LD Hub v1.9.3 (http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org). Statistical

642

significance was set to a Bonferroni-corrected level of P < 6.5x10-5.

643

Enrichment and pathway analyses.

644

Tissue enrichment for S-PrediXcan results was evaluated by calculating exact P-values for under- or over-

645

enrichment based on the cumulative distribution function of the hypergeometric distribution. The

646

Bonferroni-corrected threshold for significance was P < 0.001 considering evaluation of 52 tissues.

647

Enrichment analyses in DEPICT 71 were conducted using genome-wide significant (P < 5.0x10-8) T2D

648

GWAS lead SNPs. DEPICT is based on predefined phenotypic gene sets from multiple databases and

649

Affymetrix HGU133a2.0 expression microarray data from >37k subjects to build highly-expressed gene

650

sets for Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) tissue and cell type annotations. Output includes a P-value for

651

enrichment and a yes/no indicator of whether the FDR q-value is significant (P < 0.05). Tissue and gene-

652

set enrichment features were considered.

653

Evaluation of drug classes for genes with associations with gene expression.

654

To identify drug-gene pairs that may be leads for repurposing or may be attractive leads for novel

655

inhibitory drugs, we identified drugs targeting genes whose predicted expression was significantly

656

associated with T2D risk in S-PrediXcan analyses and which we predicted would lower blood glucose

657

based on direction of effect on T2D risk with increasing gene expression and drug action (activator or

658

inhibitor). Medications with a primary indication for diabetes and medications with adverse drug events

659

for diabetic patients were evaluated using the SIDe Effect Resource (SIDER)16. Medications targeting

660

genes were queried using DGIdb17. These drug targets represent a set of genes that are both likely to be

661

involved in glucose regulation in one or more tissues and can be targeted by drugs. Genes and

662

medications identified in this analysis are presented in Supplementary Table 14.

Figure 2: T2D gPRS is mainly predictive of micro vascular outcomes.

897
898

A T2D gPRS was calculated and categorized into deciles based on the scores in controls. The PRS-

899

outcome associations are shown for macrovascular outcomes (CHD, CKD and PAD) and for microvascular

900

outcomes (retinopathy, neuropathy, and acute ischemic stroke). Effect sizes and 95% confidence

901

intervals are shown per decile per micro- or macrovascular outcome. For each of the complication

902

outcomes separate logistic regression model are fitted for people with T2D, and the models include the

903

following independent variables: T2D PRS (from Diamante consortium), age, gender, BMI, and 10 PCA's.

904

For coronary heart disease, a CHD PRS (from CardiogramplusC4DplusUKBB) is included in the regression

905

model as an additional covariate. For acute ischemic stroke, a stroke PRS (from Megastroke consortium)

906

is included in the regression model as an additional covariate. For chronic kidney disease, a CKD PRS

907

(from CKDgen consortium) is included in the regression model as an additional covariate.
