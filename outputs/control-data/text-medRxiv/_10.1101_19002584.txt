Abstract
Aims: This prospective study aimed to determine the proportions of therapeutic inertia when
treatment targets not achieved in adults T2D at three public health clinics in Malaysia.
Methods: The index prescriptions were those when the annual blood tests were reviewed.
Prescriptions were verified and classified as 1) no change, 2) stepping up and 3) stepping down.
Multivariable logistic regression and sensitive analyses were conducted.
Results: At follow-up, 552 participants were available for the assessment of therapeutic inertia
(78.9% response rate). The mean (SD) age and diabetes duration were 60.0 (9.9) years and 5.0
(6.0)
years, respectively. High therapeutic inertia were observed in oral anti-diabetic (61-72%),

anti-hypertensive (34-65%) and lipid-lowering therapies (56-77%), and lesser in insulin (3452%). Insulin therapeutic inertia was more likely among those with shorter diabetes duration
(adjusted OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.87, 0.98). Those who did not achieve treatment targets were less
likely to experience therapeutic inertia: HbA1c ≥ 7.0%: adjusted OR 0.10 (0.04, 0.24); BP ≥
140/90 mmHg: 0.28 (0.16, 0.50); LDL-cholesterol ≥ 2.6 mmol/L: 0.37 (0.22, 0.64).
Conclusions: Although therapeutic intensifications were more likely in the present of nonachieved treatment targets but the proportions of therapeutic inertia were high.

Introduction

Managing and achieving optimal control in glycaemia (HbA1c), blood pressure and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been very difficult [1, 2].
Proportions of achieved treatment targets in the world for HbA1c < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) were
about 50%, blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg 80% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLcholesterol) 60% [3-6], and it is worse in lower income countries [7-10] and better in a higher
income country [11]. In developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, only
3.6% of T2D patients were able to attain all three recommended targets (blood pressure < 130/80
mmHg, LDL-cholesterol < 100 mg/dl, and HbA1c < 7%)[10]. The same rate was reported as
22% in two polyclinics in Singapore [12]. Without due clinical agility and healthcare system

management for T2D, achieving and maintaining optimal treatment targets will face an uphill
task and untoward consequences to all [13-16].

Clinical inertia is defined as a failure to initiate or intensify necessary treatments at a timely
manner when faced with objective evidence of uncontrolled diseases in the present of clear
clinical practice guidelines [17-19]. Therapeutic inertia, although used interchangeably with
clinical inertia, focuses more on the prescribed therapies and pharmacological agents, and
usually construed as the providers’ failure to increase therapy when treatment targets are not met
[20]. Therapeutic inertia could be due to patient-related factors [21], physician-related and
healthcare system-related barriers [17]. A combination of these factors may exist and compound
effective and efficient diabetes care delivery and clinical consultation between the doctors and
patients, patients and facility, and doctors and facility [18, 19]. Some of the principal causes of
clinical and therapeutic inertia are doctors’ preference for status quo to avoid uncertainty and
risk [22], and impaired communication between doctors and patients [19]. Others include a lack
of infrastructure and facility for proper disease monitoring to achieve treatment goals, the
mindset of ‘waiting until next visit’ in response to soft rationalizations by patients to avoid
treatment intensification, overestimation of care provided, a lack of education and training of the
doctors, and practice organization aimed at achieving treatment targets [23, 24].

The problems of therapeutic inertia in diabetes care or a delayed response to poor glycaemic
control were about 30-40% or six months to 2 years, respectively [18]. In a recent systematic
review, the median time to treatment intensification after at least one HbA1c measurement above
target ranged from 0.3 to > 7.0 years [25]. The therapeutic inertia increased with the number of
drugs and decreased with increasing HbA1c levels [25]. The UK Clinical Practice Research
Datalink (CPRD) reported the median time of basal insulin intensification from initiation was >
4 years, and less than one-third of the eligible T2D [HbA1c ≥ 7.5% (58 mmol/mol)] had their
treatment intensified (median time: 3.7 years) [26]. The corresponding therapeutic inertia for
hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg) and dyslipidaemia (LDL-C ≥ 2.6 mmol/L or 100 mg/dl) were
46% and 40%, respectively [10].

The evidence on therapeutic inertia has been lacking at primary care setting, especially in lowand middle-income countries and in Asia [25]. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine the
proportions and associated factors of therapeutic inertia of anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive and
lipid-lowering therapies when treatment targets not achieved in adults with T2D at public health

clinics in Malaysia.

Methods

This was a cohort study that included baseline and follow-up data from a previous study in 2013
[27], together with the follow-up data from 2014 to 2016. During this period of follow-up,
patients received standard diabetes care and clinical services at the respective health clinics. The
study was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC), Ministry of Health
Malaysia.

2.1 Setting and participants
At baseline, participants were sampled consecutively as they came to the clinics over a period of
six months. Inclusion criteria at baseline: age 30 years or older, a diagnosis of T2D more than
one year ago, and with at least three clinic visits in the previous year. The baseline exclusion
criteria were pregnancy or lactating, psychiatric/ psychological disorders that could impair
judgment and memory, and participants who could not read or understand English, Malay or
Mandarin [27]. The participating health clinics were chosen because they serve different sections
of the local population. One health clinic (SK) is urban and is visited mainly by patients of
Chinese descent, the second is a rural clinic (DK) visited by proportionally more patients of
Indian descent than found in a usual public health clinic, and the third clinic (SL) is in a rural and
predominantly ethnic Malay residential area. Before the questionnaires were filled in, all
participants gave written consent in their preferred language while waiting for a medical
consultation with the clinic’s doctor. Trained research assistants interviewed participants at
baseline who were not able to self-administer the questionnaires.

2.2 Data collection
Baseline demographic data included age, gender, ethnicity, religion, educational level,
employment status, monthly income and life event within the past six months [28]. Structured
case record forms were used for data collection from the medical records. These included
duration of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetes-related complications, blood pressure, lipids, number and
type of medication use [27]. At follow-ups, participants were identified by an orange label on
their follow-up cards and on their medical records. Follow-up data were retrieved from the
medical records on glycaemic control (HbA1c), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure

(DBP), LDL-cholesterol and prescribed medications [27]. These medications included oral antidiabetic agents (ADA), insulin, oral anti-hypertensive agents (AHA) and lipid-lowering agents
(LLA). Non-participants were those who lost to follow-up at the participating clinics and nonattendance for at least more than one year between 2014 and 2016. There was no other injectable
ADA besides insulin at the three participating clinics during the period of the study. Every result
of HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol, and every reading of SBP and DBP were retrieved. The
recommended treatment targets are HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), blood pressure < 140/90
mmHg and LDL-cholesterol < 2.6 mmol/L, respectively [29]. Medications use was retrieved in
terms of their names, dose and frequency. The medications prescribed when the annual blood
tests were reviewed during the follow-up visit were considered as the index prescription. In the
event of absent of an annual blood test, the medications prescribed in the last follow-up visit of
the year were considered as the index prescription.

2.3 Data analysis
Data analyses were carried out using SPSS software version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
Comparisons of mean levels were performed using the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test
according to the data distribution, and the Chi-square test was used for proportionate samples
between groups. Characteristics of the patients who have and did not have the required data for
this study are presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR) for continuous variables, and counts and
percentages for nominal variables using descriptive statistics according to the three health
clinics.

Assessment of clinical inertia was done for year 2015 because the required medication use data
were captured from year 2014, and not possible for year 2016 as the study ended in the third
quarter. Index of medication prescription and use of the year were compared to the previous year
index prescription. Changes of medication use were classified as 1) no change, 2) stepping up:
dose increment or/and replacement with a stronger medication, and 3) stepping down: dose
reduction or/and replacement with a weaker medication. All the classification was verified by the
author himself and the resident family physicians in SK and SL health clinics. Therapeutic
inertia is defined as no change in the medication use in the present of not reaching the
recommended treatment targets. Therapeutic inertia was assessed for HbA1c (no change in ADA
and insulin uses separately) and LDL-cholesterol (no change in LLA use) by looking at the
treatment target in the same year because medication use and change was captured after the tests

were reviewed. For those who did not have results for HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol in the same
year, the results in the previous year were used. This reflects the actual clinical practice at these
health clinics. The therapeutic inertia assessment for blood pressure (no change in AHA use) was
assessed by looking for occurrence of persistent SBP/DBP above treatment targets over two
occasions with no change of AHA use in the same year. Sensitive analysis was conducted to
examine the states of therapeutic inertia for AHA use in the first half and the second half of the
year when at least four SBP/DBP measurements were available, and at least two consecutive
SBP/DBP measurements that were above the recommended treatment targets in the respective 6month periods. The results were essentially similar.
Possible clinic and patient’s factors on the therapeutic inertia were further evaluated using the
multivariable logistic regression analysis. Besides the clinic, covariates with a P value < 0.20
from the univariable analyses were included in the final multivariable analyses. Category ‘no
change’ represents therapeutic inertia and category ‘stepping up and stepping down’ was used as
the reference group. The final models were re-run with ‘stepping up’ as the reference group and
the results did not change the interpretations. We reported the results with the treatment targets
entered as one of the covariate, and the reference category of ‘stepping up and stepping down’ as
this could account for all reasons of therapeutic changes more clinically meaningful models [30].
Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results

3.1 Cohort characteristics
In total, 552 participants have the required follow-up data for the assessment of therapeutic
inertia, representing 78.9% of the baseline sample (n=700). There were no differences in the
prescribed medications between the non-participants and participants except LLA use was more
among the participants (72% vs. 83%) (Table 1). Compared to the participants, the nonparticipants were more often treated at the rural Salak Health Clinic, had higher systolic blood
pressure, and had dyslipidaemia (Table 1).

3.2 Therapeutic inertia in the three clinics
Except for ADA and LLA, there were significant differences in insulin and AHA therapeutic
patterns when treatment targets were not achieved at the three health clinics (Figure 1). DK was
less likely to have insulin therapy inertia and SK less likely to have AHA inertia compared to the
other health clinics. All clinics had high therapeutic inertia in ADA (61-72%) and LLA therapies
(56-77%).
3.3 Anti-diabetics therapy inertia
Both ADA and insulin therapeutic inertia were observed, and ADA therapeutic inertia was worse
than the insulin (64% versus 47%) (Table A.1) presumably because of limited dosing range and
choices of the oral agents. Patients who were prescribed less medication, had shorter diabetes
duration and not having dyslipidaemia were likely to experience ADA therapy inertia (Table
A.1). There was no relation between ADA changes and glycaemic control (OR 1.18, 95% CI
0.77, 1.80; P= 0.454). Insulin therapeutic inertia was more likely among those with shorter
diabetes duration (adjusted OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.87, 0.98) (Table 2).

3.4 Anti-hypertensive therapy inertia
AHA inertia was observed in about half (51%) of the participants with BP > 140/90 mmHg, and
only 34% had their AHA therapy stepped up. This inertia happened more among the younger age
group, Indians, in active employment, shorter hypertension duration and not diagnosed of
hypertension (Table A.2). Those who had at least two consecutive BP > 140/90 mmHg were
more likely to experience AHA therapy intensification (Table 3).
3.5 Lipid lowering therapy inertia
Therapeutic inertia in LLA was observed in 61% of those who had uncontrolled LDLcholesterol, and this was more common among those having hypertension on top of T2D (Table
A.3). However, no factor was an independent risk factor to LLA therapy inertia after adjusting
for LDL-cholesterol treatment target (Table 4). Those who had not achieved LDL-cholesterol
treatment target < 2.6 mmol/L were more likely to experience lipid-lowering therapy
intensification.

4 Discussion
This study examined the therapeutic patterns of ADA, AHA and LLA in adults with T2D after
three years of regular primary diabetes care at three public health clinics in Malaysia. The
findings show some similarity and differences in the therapeutic changes of these medications in
the three health clinics when treatment targets were not achieved. Although multivariable
analyses show that treatment intensifications were more likely in the face of uncontrolled

diseases, but the proportions of therapeutic inertia were high in hyperglycaemia (up to 64%),
hypertension (51%) and high LDL-cholesterol (61%). These proportions were still considered
high after taking into account the possible contraindications, intolerance and refusals to
medications of about 15 to 20% based on the authors’ experience and early studies [31, 32].

High prevalent of therapeutic inertia in ADA in all three clinics might indicate limitation in the
dosing of the oral medications when maximum doses have been prescribed and with the
restricted choices of ADA [33]. The commonly available ADA are metformin and gliclazide,
with additional one to two drugs from the newer classes of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)
inhibitors, which are restricted to the resident family physicians use. Therefore, the observed
therapeutic inertia could be a result of clinical inertia in timely referral for other ADA or insulin
initiation. It was also noted that patients who were relatively healthier (shorter diabetes duration,
no comorbid such as dyslipidaemia and fewer number of medication) were more likely to
experience ADA inertia [17]. In contrast to dose increment limitation in ADA, insulin has wider
dosing possibility and this had resulted in relatively lower insulin inertia, and recorded the
highest stepping-up rate among all the studied therapies in this study. The observed rate of
insulin intensification was similar to the Canadian specialist treating non-insulin-requiring
patients in year 2000 [34]. Patients with shorter diabetes duration of T2D were more likely to
experience insulin inertia. This might be construed that both the patients and doctors preferred
working harder on non-pharmacological means or ADA before insulin dose increment.

AHA therapeutic patterns noted a wide variations across the three clinics, and different clinic
was one of the significant factors that showed an independent effect on AHA inertia in the
multivariable model. DK was most likely to have AHA inertia compared to the other clinics.
These could be due to the differences in healthcare system-related factors such as having a
dedicated team and consultation room at SK [33]. This might contribute to a more effective
consultation with patients that improved doctor-patient communication. Other possible causes
include having competent knowledge in hypertension, and familiarity with newer AHA that are
beneficial in T2D. Therapeutic inertia in AHA could also be due to the patient-related factors
such as denial and refusal of treatment intensification due to non-experiencing of symptoms of
hypertension or disease progression [17]. Although this study did not examine the time to antihypertensive treatment intensification since two consecutive BP > 140/90 mmHg had been
recorded, it was likely that at least 40% experienced AHA inertia for longer than one year based
on the sensitive analysis conducted.

Multivariable analysis did not reveal any significant contributing factor towards LLA inertia
except that of achieving the LDL-cholesterol target. This was an assuring finding but the
proportion of therapeutic inertia was highest in LLA among the three therapies. This might
indicate that the causes were less of physician-related but more of patient-related or health
system-related. The availability of LLA to the clinics’ doctors was generally restricted to three
types of LLA namely lovastatin, simvastatin and gemfibrozil, with atorvastatin and fenofibrate
were further available with endorsement by the resident family physicians with a specialist
status. Patient-related causes might be statin intolerance and concern about statins worsen the
glycaemic control [35]. Lessons from controlled clinical trials suggested that a combination of
good patient education and support, and clear treatment strategies might reduce clinical inertia
[17]. However, this may not ensure timely treatment intensification by the attending doctors who
perceive time constraint in consultation [36] and concern about statin adverse effects.

4.1 Strength and limitations
This was probably one of the first study in Malaysia or Asia assessing all three main therapeutic
inertia among T2D at primary care in a prospective manner. Good sample size and representative
samples of the participants [27] render the study sufficient power to produce the answers. This
study was subjected to several potential limitations. This study did not classify diabetes
pharmacological regimen as a whole but ADA to insulin changes separately. Thus, escalation of
treatment from ADA to insulin therapy in the event of HbA1c ≥ 7.0% was not recorded.
Therefore, insulin therapeutic inertia provided an estimate that was closer to the actual clinical
practice because from none to insulin initiation was captured. Treatment targets used did not
reflect risk profiles and customized target levels for the patients. This may lead to
underestimation of the proportions of therapeutic inertia because majority of the adults T2D at
the primary care setting were of the lower risk and in early stages of diseases, and treatment
intensification should occur at lower target levels [37, 38]. Similarly, underestimation of the
proportions of therapeutic inertia is likely in the participants especially in ADA and LLA since
the non-participants were prescribed less of these medications at baseline. The three participating
health clinics in this study are of the medium scale with resident family physicians and doctors,
and situated in a developed state of Selangor across urban, sub-rural and rural regions. This
limits generalizability of the results to other clinics of different scales, without resident doctors
or in the more remote areas in the country that may have different healthcare systems and
delivery at the meso- and micro-levels.

5 Conclusion
Although therapeutic intensifications were more likely in the present of non-achieved glycaemic,
blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol treatment targets but the proportions of adults with T2D
who faced therapeutic inertia were high at primary diabetes care in Malaysia. Possible causes of
therapeutic inertia require urgent identification and rectification to improve disease control [3941]. Delay in treatment intensification for T2D and prolonged suboptimal control of
hypertension and high LDL-cholesterol in people with T2D will lead to detrimental health
implications and costly consequences.
