Abstract

31

Anaemia among children under 5, is a public health problem of serious concern. In

32

Ghana, 8 out of every 10 children are anaemic. This study employed a novel approach

33

to investigate the determinants of normal haemoglobin (Hb) concentration among

34

children aged 6 to 59 months, using data from the Ghana Demographic and Health

35

Surveys. The results showed that a year change in maternal education was positively

36

associated with normal Hb concentration. Children of non-anaemic mothers were 1.67

37

(CI=1.32, 2.10; P<.001) times more likely to have normal Hb concentration relative to

38

children of anaemic mothers. Compared to mothers who had less than 4 antenatal care

39

(ANC) visits, mothers who had at least 4 ANC visits increased the odds of their children

40

having a normal Hb concentration by 1.62 (CI=1.09, 2.40; P<.018). Children living in

41

middle and rich households had respectively 1.48 (CI=1.06, 2.07; p<.021) and 1.59

42

(CI=1.08, 2.33; p<.018) increased odds of having a normal Hb concentration relative to

43

those living in poor households. Maternal education, anaemia, ANC attendance, and

44

household wealth index are strong determinants of normal Hb concentration among

45

children in Ghana. Strategies aimed at addressing childhood anaemia should take into

46

account maternal anaemia, education, poverty and ANC attendance.

Introduction

59

a pervasive problem among children under five years of age. It reflects a state in which

60

the number of red blood cells is low, or their ability to carry oxygen is poor (3). If

61

anaemia is left untreated, it can have significant negative consequences on child health,

62

some of which can be long lasting (4) and potentially derail the life-course wellbeing into

63

adulthood. These adverse health consequences include but are not limited to poor

64

cognitive development, difficulty with concentration, lethargy, increased mortality,

65

susceptibility to infection and loss of economic productivity in adulthood (5, 6). Given the

66

consequences, there is an urgent need for effective and efficient public health

67

interventions to address anaemia in children. To be able to design effective

68

interventions, it is significant to have clear understanding of the factors that have the

69

potential to prevent children from developing anaemia. The present study is set out to

70

illuminate these factors by focusing on children who have normal Hb concentration (i.e.

71

children who do not have any form of anaemia).

72

understanding of what promote normal Hb concentration, rather than the risk factors of

73

low Hb concentration (anaemia). Indeed, knowledge about the determining factors of

74

normal Hb concentration in children, which is currently lacking in sub-Saharan Africa

75

(SSA), is essential for developing effective anaemia prevention programmes.

Anaemia, defined as blood haemoglobin concentration lower than normal (1, 2) is

The study will provide a robust

76

Data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) show that anaemia is one of the

77

ten most serious health problems in the world (1). Globally, it is estimated that about

78

273.2 million children aged from 6 to 59months suffer from anaemia, with an overall

79

prevalence of 43% (3). The problem is particularly serious in Africa, where

80

approximately 60% of preschool children are anaemic (7). The prevalence in the SSA

81

region ranges from 42% in Swaziland to 91% in Burkina Faso (8). In Ghana, the focus

82

of the present study, the overall prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6 to 59 months

83

stands at 78.4% (9, 10), indicating that less than a third (21.6%) of children in Ghana

84

have normal Hb concentration or are non-anaemic. The question is, what makes the

85

21.6% (defined in this study as positive deviants) to have normal Hb concentration,

86

although they live in the same country as the rest of the children who are anaemic?

88

influence normal Hb concentration for these children? Understanding this will help

89

design effective programmes to help prevent pre-school children in Ghana from

90

developing anaemia.

91

However, to be able to address the questions outlined above, we needed an

92

approach that will focus on the positive aspects of health and the associated

93

determinants rather than negative health outcomes. Therefore, this study utilised

94

positive deviance (PD), a resource oriented approach as the analytical strategy. The

95

concept of PD is premised on the notion that in “every community there are certain

96

individuals or groups whose uncommon behaviours and strategies enable them to find

97

better solutions to problems than their peers, while having access to the same

98

resources and facing similar or worse challenges”(11, 12). The PD concept aims to

99

study the behaviours and characteristics of those who achieve better results on a given

100

health outcome than their peers who reside in the same community (13). It is a well-

101

established concept and can be explored using a statistical approach, and often

102

quantified as those who do not experience a negative outcome of interest compared to

103

those around them in the same settings (13). The PD approach has previously been

104

used to investigate new born care, child nutrition, safe sexual practices, malaria control,

105

health service delivery and educational outcomes in many settings (14-22). Indeed,

106

almost all of these PD studies were conducted outside SSA. In Ghana for example, the

107

application of PD in investigating child health outcomes is relatively rare. This suggests

108

the need for more research using the PD approach in Ghana.

109

The novelty of the PD approach is its focus on ‘positive’ aspects of an outcome

110

instead of the ‘negative’, and can identify potential points of intervention. In the present

111

study, positive deviants were children who lived in anaemia endemic Ghana and yet

112

have normal Hb concentration (not anaemic) relative to their counterparts who live in

113

the same country but are anaemic. The main objective of this study is to examine the

114

determinants of normal Hb concentration among children living in Ghana. Identifying

115

these determinants would provide the basis for designing programmes, targeting

116

children at risk of low Hb concentration in Ghana. This resource focused approach

117

moves away from the dominant risk model approach, where the focus is usually on

118

children with poor health and the associated risk factors.

Methodology
Design and data sources

122

Data on haemoglobin (Hb) concentration (anaemia) among children aged 6–59

123

months from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS) (23) were

124

used in the analysis. The DHS surveys are designed to be representative at the

125

national, regional and rural-urban levels. The Ghana DHS employed a two-stage

126

sampling design. The first stage involved selection of clusters from a master sampling

127

frame constructed from the 2010 national population and housing census. The clusters

128

are selected using systematic sampling with probability proportional to size. The second

129

stage selection involves the systematic sampling of the households listed in each

130

cluster, and households to be included in the survey are randomly selected from the list.

131

All women aged 15-49 years and their children aged 0-59 months were eligible to

132

participate in the surveys. The data on children were obtained through face-to-face

133

interviews with their mothers. The detailed description of the GDHS sampling strategy

134

can be found elsewhere (10, 24). Our study sample comprised children aged 6–59

135

months (n =2451), born to mothers aged 15–49 years.

136
137

Ethical considerations

138

The GDHS protocol, including biomarker collection, was reviewed and approved

139

by the Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee and the Institutional Review

140

Board of ICF International, USA. Written informed consent was obtained from

141

participants before the survey. For children aged 6-59 months, consent was obtained

142

from their parents or the adult responsible for the children. The GDHS team made sure

143

that the biomarker results were made available to study participants. For example, the

144

Hb test results for all children tested in the household were entered into a malaria and

145

anaemia brochure and given to the parent or responsible adult. Finally, an anaemia

146

referral form was given to facilitate immediate treatment at a nearby health facility of

147

children with an Hb level less than 7.0 g/dl (10). The DHS Program, USA, granted the

148

author permission to use the data. The data are completely anonymous; therefore the

149

author did not seek further ethical clearance.

Outcome and explanatory measures

152

Outcome measure

153

The main outcome measure for this analysis was Hb concentration (anaemia).

154

The GDHS collected blood specimens for anaemia testing from all children aged 6-59

155

months. Blood samples were drawn from a drop of blood taken from a finger prick (or a

156

heel prick in the case of children age 6-11 months) and collected in a microcuvette. The

157

Hb analysis was carried out on-site using a battery-operated portable HemoCue

158

analyser. The Hb data were categorised into; mild anaemia (Hb concentration of 10.0-

159

10.9 g/dL), moderate anaemia (Hb concentration of 7.0-9.9 g/dL) and severe anaemia

160

(Hb concentration of less than 7.0 g/dL) (10). In this analysis, mild, moderate and

161

severe anaemia were recoded into “anaemic or low Hb concentration” and given a value

162

of “0” (referenced category), and children who did not suffer from any form of anaemia

163

were classified as “non-anaemic or normal Hb concentration” and given a value of “1”

164

(outcome of interest). To make the interpretation of the results easier, considering the

165

approach used, Hb concentration was used in place of anaemia in the interpretation of

166

the results. Since positive deviance (25) is the analytic lens, children with normal Hb

167

concentration were classified as positive deviants.

168
169

Explanatory measure

170

The explanatory measures were categorized into four levels of determinants:

171

child (sex, age, birth order, diarrhoea, taking iron pills, drugs for intestinal parasites),

172

maternal (age, education, anaemia status, antenatal care), households (household size,

173

number of children under 5, wealth index) and community (place of residence). Some of

174

these variables were recoded: antenatal care (ANC) was recoded into 0-3 visits

175

(reference category) and 4 or more visits, while household wealth index was recoded

176

into poor (reference category), and middle and richer as categories of interest. The

177

selection of the explanatory variables was guided by the UNICEF conceptual framework

178

of child care (26). The selected variables were further subjected to bivariate analysis to

179

establish their relationship with the outcome variable (results not shown). All statistically

180

significant variables were included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Analytical framework and methods

183

The analysis in this paper was framed using the extended UNICEF conceptual

184

framework for childcare (26, 27). The framework posits that child survival, growth and

185

development are influenced by a web of factors, with three underlying determinants

186

being food security, healthcare and a healthy environment, and care for children and

187

women (26). These underlying determinants are in turn influenced by basic

188

determinants.

189

determinants, which influence child health through their effect on the intervening

190

proximate

191

endogenously determined by the exogenous determinants (28). In this analysis, we

192

built two empirical regression models of the determinants of normal Hb concentration. In

193

the first model (Model 1), we included maternal, household and community level

194

determinants. In the second and final model (Model 2), we adjusted for child level

195

factors. The statistical significant level was set at p<.05. Results were presented as odd

196

ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

These basic

underlying

determinants may be described as

Results

199

Descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the sample

200

The results in Table 1 show that 32% of children in Ghana have normal Hb

201

concentration, while 56% of their mothers were non-anaemic or had normal Hb

202

concentration. Twenty three percent (23%) of the children were reportedly taking iron

203

pills/sprinkles/syrup at the time of the survey. A little over a third (38%) of the children

204

received drugs for intestinal parasites. The results also showed that 13% of the children

205

had diarrhoea during the last 2 weeks preceding the survey. An ANC attendance of at

206

least 4 visits was high among mothers in the sample (89%). A little over half (54%) of

207

the study participants were living in rural areas. The mean maternal number of years of

208

education was 5.2±4.9, while the average age was 31.0±6.8 years. The mean child age

209

was 31.3±15.4 months. Household size and child birth order were 5.8±2.7 and 3.4±2.1

210

respectively (Table 2).

Multivariable analysis of the protective factors for childhood anaemia

219

The results in Table 3 show that all the maternal and household level factors

220

except household size were significantly associated with normal Hb concentration in the

221

first model (Model 1) but these significant associations disappeared after child level

222

determinants were included the final empirical model (Model 2). Only maternal

223

education, anaemia, ANC attendance, household wealth index and child age maintain

224

their statistically significant association with normal Hb concentration in the final model.

225

A unit change in maternal years of education was associated with 1.05 (CI=1.02, 1.08;

226

P<.001) increased odds of normal Hb concentration. Children of mothers who had

227

normal Hb concentration (non-anaemic) were 1.67 (CI=1.32, 2.10; P<.001 ) times more

228

likely to have normal Hb concentration relative to children of anaemic (low Hb

229

concentration) mothers. Compared to mothers who had less than 4 antenatal care

230

(ANC) visits, mothers who had at least 4 ANC visits increased the odds of their children

231

having a normal Hb concentration by 1.62 (CI=1.09, 2.40; P<.018). Additionally, children

232

living in middle and rich households had 1.48 (CI=1.06, 2.07; p<.021) and 1.59

233

(CI=1.08, 2.33; p<.018) increased odds of having a normal Hb concentration

234

respectively, relative to those living in poor households. A unit change in child’s age was

235

associated with 1.03 (CI=1.02, 1.04; P<.001) increased odds of having a normal Hb

236

concentration or not being anaemic.

Discussion

251

This study examined the determinants of normal Hb concentration among

252

children in Ghana, using nationally representative data. The analysis focused on

253

children who are doing well (positive deviants) rather than the usual practice of focusing

254

on at risk or children with poor health outcomes. The results showed that maternal

255

education, anaemia, ANC attendance, household wealth index and child age are strong

256

determinants of normal Hb concentration among children. Mothers who have more

257

years of education are likely to have children with normal Hb concentration. This

258

suggests that the more years of education a mother has the likelihood that their children

259

will have normal Hb concentration. This could be attributed to positive influence of

260

education on maternal caregiving practices. There is evidence that mothers with more

261

years of education are likely to be good caregivers and sensitive and responsive to

262

caregiving duties (29, 30). They also tend to have disposal income to be able to provide

263

nutritious, including iron rich food for their children. The evidence to this effect can be

264

found in a study by Choi and colleagues (31), where children of educated mothers were

265

reportedly consuming more iron rich diet such as meat and poultry than did children of

266

less educated mothers. Educated mothers are also more likely to utilize child health

267

services, which can have a positive effect on their children health outcomes (32, 33).

268

The findings from the present study are consistent with the literature. Several studies

269

have demonstrated that children with more educated mothers are less likely to develop

270

anaemia than those with less educated mothers (31, 34-36).

271

Maternal anaemia status was also illuminated as an important determinant of

272

normal Hb concentration among preschool children. There is a strong observed

273

relationship between maternal anaemia status and child Hb concentration. Mothers who

274

are non-anaemic turn to have children who have normal Hb concentration. Thus,

275

whether a child will have normal Hb concentration or not is conditional on the anaemia

276

status of the mother. This may be the case because poor maternal health has the

277

potential to compromise optimal child caring practices, which will in turn have negative

278

impact on their children health and wellbeing (37, 38). Also, mothers who are non-

279

anaemic are likely to have access to nutritious food. Since there is a strong correlation

280

between maternal and child dietary intake (39, 40), the likelihood that the children will

281

also consume nutritious food is high. The literature on the effects of maternal anaemia

282

status on childhood anaemia is abound. Studies have shown that mothers Hb level had

283

significant effect on their children Hb levels (36, 41, 42). Furthermore, in Mozambique,

284

the odds of having non-anaemic child was higher in communities with low percentage

285

of anaemic mothers (43). Thus, strategies for minimising childhood anaemia must

286

address maternal anaemia.

287

This study reveals that mothers who were able to attend at least four ANC visits

288

are likely to have children with normal Hb concentration. This suggests that higher ANC

289

visits has the potential to promote normal Hb concentration among children living in

290

highly endemic anaemia settings.

291

women of reproductive age will have the potential to protect their children from

292

developing anaemia in the first 5 years of their life. The positive effect of ANC

293

attendance on childhood anaemia status could be attributed to the health and nutrition

294

education mothers received during ANC visits. This could have positive impact on their

295

feeding and caring practices, and consequently better health outcomes for their

296

children. Kuhnt and Vollmer (44) found in their study that having at least four ANC visits

297

is associated with reduced odds of malnutrition among children. ANC attendance has

298

also been found to associate directly with improved birth outcomes and longer-term

299

reductions of child mortality and malnourishment (44). There is evidence that women

300

who have higher ANC visits are also likely to patronise postnatal services (45), with the

301

consequential positive effect on their children health outcomes. Our findings together

302

with literature suggest that interventions to address childhood anaemia in Ghana should

303

promote ANC use among women of reproductive age, so as to protect their children

304

from developing anaemia.

Therefore, promoting ANC attendance among

305

Similarly, the analysis show that the level of household wealth is an important

306

determinant of normal Hb concentration among children in Ghana. Children who live in

307

middle and rich household are more likely to have a normal Hb concentration relative to

308

those who live in poor households. The association is stronger in the rich households

309

than the middle class households. The differential effect can be explained by the fact

310

that children in rich households are likely have easy access to nutritious food and better

311

caring practices, prerequisites for optimal child health. The effect of household wealth

312

on normal Hb concentration could be a confirmation of the widely recognised health

313

benefits of living in better-off households (42, 46-48). Conversely, Agho and colleagues

314

(49) observed that children from the richest and middle-class households had a lower

315

Hb concentration than those from the poorest households (49). This negative

316

relationship notwithstanding, the evidence as highlighted above is that children in

317

wealthy household tend to have higher Hb concentration or better health outcomes

318

compared to those living in poor households.

319

The study is associated with some strengths and limitations. The use of large

320

nationally representative sample makes the observed associations more robust, and

321

enhanced the generalisability of the findings to all children 6-59 months in Ghana.

322

Further,

323

misclassification. The novelty of this study is its focus on non-anaemic (normal Hb

324

concentration) children and the associated protective factors rather than risks factors for

325

childhood anaemia. A limitation worth mentioning is the cross-sectional nature of the

326

data, which does not lends itself to the establishments of causal relationship between

327

the predictor and outcome variables. The conclusions in the paper are therefore

328

interpreted as mere associations between the predictor variables and the outcome

329

variable. Another limitation is that the use of PD is somewhat limited as we were not

330

able to explore all the potential PD behaviours that may contribute to normal Hb

331

concentration

Notwithstanding, PD is a well-established concept and hence makes it possible to

Conclusions

336

The results of study showed that mothers who have higher years of education

337

are likely to have children with normal Hb concentration. This suggests that the more

338

years of education a mother may potentially results in their children having normal Hb

339

concentration. There is a strong relationship between maternal anaemia status and
