Abstract

19

Background: Hypertension is a common vascular disease and the main risk factor for

20

cardiovascular diseases. The impact of hypertension is on the rise in Ethiopia, so that, it is

21

predictable that the cost of healthcare services will further increase in the future. We aimed to

22

estimate the total cost of hypertension illness among patients attending hospitals in Southwest

23

Shewa zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.

24

Patients and methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 1-30,

25

2018. All hypertensive patients who were on treatment and whose age was greater than eighteen

26

years old were eligible for this study. The total cost of hypertension illness was estimated by

27

summing up the direct and indirect costs. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis was

28

conducted to identify factors associated with hypertension costs of illness.

29

Results: Overall, the mean monthly total cost of hypertension illness was US $ 22.3 (95% CI,

30

21.3-23.3). Direct and indirect costs share 51% and 49% of the total cost, respectively. The mean

31

total direct cost of hypertension illness per patient per month was US $11.39(95% CI, 10.6-12.1).

32

Out of these, drugs accounted of a higher cost (31%) followed by food (25%). The mean total

33

indirect cost per patient per month was US $10.89(95% CI, 10.4-11.4). Educational status, distance

34

from hospital, the presence of companion and the stage of hypertension were predictors of the cost

35

of illness of hypertension.

36

Conclusion: The cost of hypertension illness was very high when compared with the mean

37

monthly income of the patients letting patients to catastrophic costs. Therefore, due attention

38

should be given by the government to protect patients from financial hardships.

39

Key words: Illness, total cost, direct cost, indirect cost, Region, Ethiopia.

Introduction

41

Hypertension is one of the main public health problem seen among adults worldwide.

42

Hypertension is often defined as Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg or Diastolic Blood

43

Pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg. It is the main risk factor to cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as

44

heart diseases and stroke (1,2).

45

Worldwide, 45% of deaths as the result of heart diseases and 51% of deaths due to stroke was

46

attributable to hypertension(3). In 2012 alone, 17.5 million people were died due to CVDs, which

47

translated to every three people deaths in ten (4). Out of these deaths, over half, 9.4 million, deaths

48

are caused by complications of hypertension(4,5). Hypertension was the fourth and seventh

49

contributor to premature deaths in developed and developing countries , respectively (6).

50

The prevalence of hypertension is in a high rise wordwide over time (7) and the prevalence varies

51

across the different regions and country income groups. Recent evidences indicated that an

52

estimated 1.13 billion people have hypertension worldwide. Out of these, the majority (around two

53

thirds) were located in low and middle income countries. The prevalence ranged from 27% in the

54

World Health Organization (WHO) Africa region to 18% in the WHO region of Americans. The

55

high rise in the prevalence of hypertension was attributed to the increase in the risk factors such as

56

physical inactivity, the consumtion of tobacco and alcohol, unhealthy diet, overweight and obesity

57

in those population groups (2,7).

58

In Ethiopia evidences showed that the prevalence and impact of non-communicable diseases

59

(NCDs) including hypertension has increased over time(8). A meta analysis and other surveys

60

conducted in different parts of Ethiopia revealed that the prevalence of hypertesion was increasing

61

in Ethiopia. The prevalence was high and ranged from 24.4% to 34.7% (9–13). The latest WHO

62

published data in 2017 indicated that deaths attributed to hypertension reached 11,050 deaths or

63

1.74% of the total deaths in Ethiopia. The age adjusted death rate in Ethiopia was 25.14 per

64

100,000 of population and this ranked Ethiopia 38th in the world. Hypertension was ranked 11th

65

out of the top 20 causes of death in the country(14). Ethiopia was prone to double burden of

66

diseases, both infectious and non-infectious diseses, that requires a urgent government actions(15).

67

The government of Ethiopia (GoE) has expressed its commitment for tacking premature deaths

68

attributed to non-communicable diseases by signing the sustainable development goals

69

(SDGs)(16) and incorporating related targets within the national health sector transformation plan

70

(HSTP)(17). To effect this target, a comprehensive prevention and control strategic action plan of

71

NCDs including hypertension was developed at national level with a particular emphasis to

72

reducing risky behaviors(18).

73

Cost of health services is important determinant of the acceptability and utilization of health

74

services by the society. The goal of health system is improving the health conditions of citizens

75

through protecting financial catastrophes or hardships(19,20). The management of hypertension is

76

cost intensive and hence, it may cause economic burden on citizens(21–24). Society may not afford

77

available services leading to ineffectiveness of hypertension managements(25). Hypertension cost

78

of illness was determined by various factors such as the presence of co-morbidity, stage of illness

79

and distance to health facility(22,26). Therefore, it is crucial to quantify the cost of hypertension

80

illness and identify the factors that determines the cost of hypertension illness among patients in

81

Ethiopia.

82

Available investigations on the cost of hypertension illness in Ethiopia have focused on the direct

83

costs of illness (26) and to our best knowledge little was known about the indirect costs of

84

hypertension illness. Hence, the aim of this study was to estimate the cost of hypertension illness

among patients in four hospitals of Southwest Shewa zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. We

86

estimated the direct, indirect and total costs of hypertension illness. Moreover, we tried to identify

87

the potential predictors of the total costs of hypertension illness.

Patients and methods

89

Study setting

90

The study was conducted in four hospitals of Southwest Shewa zone from August 13 to September

91

2, 2018. Southwest Shewa zone is one among the zonal administrations located in Oromia

92

Regional State, 114 km far away from the capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. The total

93

population of the zone was 1,101,129. Southwest Shewa zone comprised of 3 government

94

hospitals, 1 other government organization (OGO) hospital, 54 health centers and 264 health posts.

95

The hospitals were named as St. Luke general hospital; Tulo Bolo, Ameya and Bantu primary

96

hospitals, respectively.

97

These hospitals provides high level curative services such as the management of non-

98

communicable diseases like hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart diseases and stroke to the

99

catchment population of the zone and neighboring zones.

100

Study design and participants

101

Institution based cross-sectional study design was employed and the perspective of patients was

102

used to estimate the cost of hypertension illness. All hypertensive patients who were on follow-

103

up at hospitals and whose age was greater than 18 years old and who have been taken

104

antihypertensive medications were eligible for this study. Pregnant women were excluded from

105

this study to avoid gestational hypertension, as its effect may not last long.

106

Study sample size was determined using a single population mean formula(27). A previous report

107

from Ethiopia public hospitals indicated that the mean or median drug prescription cost of

108

hypertension was 100 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) or US $ 3.6 (SD 41.19 or 1.5)(26). By using the

109

assumptions above, the estimated sample size at 95% confidence interval and 4% absolute

110

allowable error (precision) yields 408 patients.

Where;
 Z1-α/2=is the value obtained from the standard normal distribution table for 100 (1-α) %

 SD= is the population standard deviation (41.19 )(26)

116

 d=is the absolute allowable error (or precision) in the estimation (4% of 100birr =4birr).

117

The allowable error in estimating the average cost of prescription of drug for hypertension

118

was 4 birr.

119

Though, as the number of hypertension patients on follow-up care (source population)) were less

120

than 10,000 in the study area (N=1451), we corrected the sample size to the actual population size

121

and this yields 318 patients. While, by adding 10% of non-response rate, the final estimated sample

122

size yields 354 patients.

and sample size allocated for each hospitals were: St. Luke General hospital (N=620, n=152); Tulu

127

Bolo hospital (N=315, n=76); Amaya hospital (N=241, n=59); and Bantu hospital (N=275, n=67).

128

Each eligible patients who were presented to the study hospitals during the data collection period

129

were approached and interviewed.

130

Measurement

131

A structured data collection tools were used to gather data. The contents of the questionnaires were

132

developed based WHO protocol for survey to determine costs of TB treatment program (28)and

133

other related literatures(26).

134

The contents of the questionnaires were translated to local language (Afan Oromo) by an

135

experienced translator and back translated to English with an independent translator for

136

consistency. Five data collectors with a qualification of diploma nurse and who had also received

137

additional training on the data collection questionnaires and research ethics were participated on

138

data collection. The overall data collection processes were closely monitored and supervised by

139

two health professionals who had a qualification of bachelor’s degree. Each eligible patients who

140

visits the hospitals were approached and interviewed after explaining the aim of the study and

141

obtaining a consent for participation.

142

Techniques of cost estimation

143

The cost of hypertension illnesses analysis was conducted from the perspective of patients and a

144

prevalence based model was employed to estimate cost(29). The main outcome variable was total

145

cost of hypertension illness and it referred to the cost paid by patients as a consequence of a

146

hypertension illness, typically it included both the direct and the indirect costs associated with

147

hypertension illness. That means, total cost equals to the sum of direct and indirect cost of

148

hypertension illness.

149

Direct cost referred to the opportunity cost of resources used for treating hypertension patients

150

such as direct medical cost and direct non-medical cost. Direct medical cost was the amount of

151

money that was paid for registration, laboratory investigation and medication or drugs in the study

152

health facilities during the data collection period as presented below:

153

 Cost of hospital admission=Number of days admitted multiplied by cost per day

154

 Investigation cost=Number of investigations carried out multiplied by cost of each

155
156

investigations (unit price)
 Cost of drug=Number of prescription given multiplied by cost of each drugs (unit price)

157

Direct non-medical costs referred to the amount of money that was paid for transportation, food,

158

and accommodation for both patients and their caregiver (companion) to visit the hospital.

159

Transportation costs were estimated based on the number of visits made to hospitals (round trips)

160

to seek care and logging or accommodation costs were estimated based on the number of days of

161

stay at hospitals as described below:

162
163
164
165

 Cost of transportation=Number of round trips from home to care provider multiplied by
the cost of single trip
 Cost of lodging or accommodation=Money spent for food and accommodations multiplied
by number of days patients and their companion were away from their home

166

Indirect cost was the value of resources lost due to a particular illness. Indirect costs were

167

associated with loss of working time of the hypertension patients and their caregivers (companion).

168

The loss of income of a person was due to absenteeism or missing a business appointment. Loss

169

of income or earning was calculated for both employed and unemployed patients as shown below:

172

The costs of illnesses (both direct and indirect) were estimated as expressed for a 30-day period.

173

The valuation of direct and indirect costs were based on a record review and patients recall.

174

The direct costs of hypertension illness were estimated by using micro-costing and bottom-up

175

approaches(29). Accordingly, the healthcare consumptions were collected at individual patient

176

level and the illness costs were also modeled at the same level. The direct costs such as costs of

177

drugs, laboratory investigations and registrations were estimated based on the amount consumed

178

by each patients. Health care consumption data were obtained through review of hospitals

179

outpatient department (OPD) registration books and follow-up cards.

180

The indirect costs were estimated in terms of the productivity time losses of patients and their

181

caregivers (companion). The human capital approach was used to value the productity time

182

losses(29). Indirect costs were estimated for patients’ time lost from work during travel and

183

consultation at care providers. First, the time forgone in seeking care and the productivity time lost

184

were estimated. Then, the time forgone in seeking care and the productivity time lost were

185

converted in to the daily indirect costs based on the daily wage rate. Finally, the value obtained by

186

doing so was multiplied by the number of working days lost.

187

For monthly paid patients and companion, the daily wage rate was estimated by dividing their net

188

monthly salary by 30 days. The income loses to patients who had no permanent job and farmers

189

were estimated using local daily wage rate (Ethiopian birr per day) for unskilled labor and number

190

of working days per month. The local daily wage rate for unskilled labor were obtained from the

191

response of patients.

192

Whereas, the daily wage rate of daily paid patients and companion were estimated based on the

193

patients reported daily earnings. The indirect costs of unemployed patients, such as students and

194

patients who were not working due to physical or mental disability, were not considered in the

195

calculations.

196

All direct costs, indirect costs and productivity losses were initially collected in Ethiopian currency

197

(birr) and then converted to US $ during the analysis. A currency exchange rate of 1US $=27.471

198

Ethiopian Birr as of August 2018 was employed in the analysis.

199

Data sources

200

The sources of information’s for estimating the costs of hypertension illness were both patients

201

and medical records. Direct cost of illness was estimated based on the information obtained

202

through patient interview and record review. Information related to indirect costs such as costs of

203

transportation and logging were gathered through patients and companion interviews (Table 1).

204

Data analysis

205

Paper based data were checked for completeness and consistency. Following this, data were

206

entered by using Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS 20 for analysis.

207

The analysis was performed in such a way that, first, descriptive statistics was conducted to analyze

208

information related to the characteristics of patients and to estimate the costs of hypertension

209

illness. Following this, cost of illness data were checked for normality by using plots (Q-Q plots

210

and histograms) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality (P>0.05). By doing so, the cost data

211

were found to be right skewed and log transformation was performed to approximately conform

212

the skewed data to normality.

213

Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictors of the total cost of

214

hypertension illness among patients.

215

In the regression model, independent variables with a probability value (P-value < 0.05) have been

216

entered and only statistically significant variables (P-value < 0.05) were included into the final

217

model and interpreted.

218

Ethical Considerations

219

Research protocol was submitted to Jimma University Institute of health ethics review board and

220

ethical clearance was obtained (protocol number IHRPGD/453/2018, July 2018). Research ethical

221

clearance and permission was also obtained from Oromia regional health bureau and Southwest

222

Shewa zone health department. The objective of the study was briefly explained to research

223

participants followed by consent as assurance to their voluntary participation. The confidentiality

224

of patient’s information was maintained throughout the data collection and analysis processes.

225

Codes were used instead of patient identifying information’s and patient’s data were kept in a

226

locked cabinet and in a password secured computers. Except the research team members, no one

227

can access the patients data without due consent of individual patients.

Characteristics of patients

233

Table 2 presented the characteristics of patients in the study area. The mean age of patients was 52

234

years (SD 14). The youngest patient was 22 years and the oldest one was 88 years. A bit more than

235

half (52%) of patients were male. The majority of patients were married (80%), orthodox religion

236

followers (56%), have no education (44%), employed (78%) and from urban settings (60%) (Table

237

2). The average monthly income of patients and households were 115.4 US $ (SD 70.1) and 136.8

238

US $ (SD 105.9), respectively.

239

Cost of hypertension illness

240

Cost by patients

241

Table 3 presented the direct and indirect cost of hypertension illness among patients on follow-up

242

care by cost category. The estimated total direct cost of hypertension illness was 3032.3 US $ .The

243

mean direct cost of hypertension illness was US $ 8.8 (95% CI, 8.2-9.3). Most (60%) of the direct

244

costs of hypertension illness were attributed to medical costs (mean annual cost, US $ 5.2; 95%

245

CI, 4.8-5.5). The direct medical costs comprised of cost for drugs, laboratory tests, registration and

246

cost for non-prescribed drugs. Slightly over two-thirds (69%) of total medical costs were

247

contributed by the cost of drugs alone (mean annual cost, US $ 3.6; 95% CI, 3.4-3.8). While costs

248

for laboratory tests and registration were accounted of 13% (mean annual cost, US $ 1.2; 95% CI,

249

1.1-1.4) and 7% (mean annual cost, US $ 0.4; 95% CI, 0.37-0.39) of the total medical costs,

250

respectively (Table 3).

251

On average patients have visited hospitals once per month and half of patients have used bus as a

252

means of transportation to visit hospitals. The mean lost earning day of patients due to hypertension

253

illness was one working day. The total cost of lost earning was US $ 1, 927.9 and on average each

254

patients paid US $ 6.7 (95% CI, 6.3-7.0) (Table 3).

255

Cost by companions

256

Table 4 presented the costs of hypertension illness paid by companions. Out of the total patients

257

who have visited hospitals (349), the majority (87%; 95% CI, 83-90) had family or friend that

258

accompany them. Half of the companions (52%; 95%, CI 46-57) have lost some portion of their

259

income as they care patients. The mean direct cost of companion was US$ 3.1 (95% CI, 2.7-3.6)

260

and the mean forgone earning by the companion as the result of hypertension illness was US $ 6.2

261

(95% CI, 5.9-6.5) (Table 4).

262

Total cost of hypertension illness

263

Table 5 presented the total cost of hypertension illness. The total cost of hypertension illness was

264

US $ 7,773.5(mean monthly cost, US $ 22.3; 95% CI, 21.3-23.3). Out of these, direct costs

265

accounted of 51% or US $ 3,973.8. The mean monthly and annual direct cost of hypertension

266

illness per patient were US$ 11.4 (95% CI, 10.6-12.1) and US $ 136.6 (95% CI, 127.7-145.5),

267

respectively (Table 5).

268

The mean monthly and annual indirect costs of hypertension illness per patient were US $ 10.9

269

(95% CI, 10.4-11.4) and US $ 130.7, respectively. Indirect cost was the time devoted by

270

hypertension patients and companion in one month recall period. It included detail time spent by

271

patients and companion. Indirect cost was expressed by the lost days of patients and companion

272

during the follow-up visits or seeking treatments. A total of 833 days were used by patients and

273

companion with median of 1.9 days in one month period. The time spent by patients and

274

companion to visit hospital was 26,585 minute with median of 60 minutes (round trip) (Table 5).

Predictors of cost of hypertension illness

276

Table 6 presented the bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis results. In the bivariate

277

linear regression analysis variables such as gender, marital status, educational status, family size,

278

residence, distance from hospital, presence of companion and stage of hypertension were

279

associated with total cost of hypertension illness.

280

After adjusted for other independent variables, educational status, distance from hospital, presence

281

of companion and stage of hypertension were statistically associated with the total cost of illness.

282

Twenty three percent (23%) of the variability in the total cost of hypertension illness was explained

283

by these variables (Table 6).

284

Patients with no education have a higher total cost of hypertension illness compared to patients

285

with a primary educational level (β-coefficient=-0.07; 95% CI, (-0.124,-0.020).

286

The total cost of hypertension illness increased with the increase in distance to hospital. With a

287

unit increase in distance to hospitals, the total cost of hypertension illness increased by about US

288

$ 0.003(95% CI, 0.002, 0.004) keeping the other variables constant.

289

Moreover, the total cost of hypertension illness was associated with the presence of companion

290

and the stage of hypertension. The total cost of hypertension was higher among patients who have

291

companion compared to those who didn’t have (β-coefficient=0.096; 95% CI, 0.057, 0.135).

292

Likewise, the total cost of hypertension illness was higher among patients in the hypertension stage

293

of two compared to patients in the prehypertension stage (β-coefficient=0.070; 95% CI, 0.023,

294

0.118) (Table 6).

Discussion

296

Cost of illnesses analysis is useful to understand the burden of a particular disease in a society(29–

297

31). In this study we estimated the cost of hypertension illness among patients on follow-up care.

298

The estimated total cost of hypertension illness was 7775.5 USD and out of these direct cost

299

accounted of 51%. The average annual cost of hypertension illness among patients was US $ 267.2.

300

Likewise, the annual mean direct and indirect costs per patients were US $ 136.6 and US $ 130.7,

301

respectively. In this study variables such as educational status, distance from hospital, the presence

302

of companion and stage of hypertension were the predictors of the total cost of hypertension illness

303

in the study area.

304

The cost of hypertension illness was lower that a study conducted in Kenya, where the mean annual

305

direct and indirect cost to patient were US$ 304.8 (95% CI, 235.7‐374.0) and US$ 171.7 (95% CI,

306

152.8‐190.5), respectively (23). However, the cost of hypertension illness was higher than a study

307

conducted in India (32) and Addis Ababa (26). This difference might be due to variation in

308

settings, period and methods of cost estimation employed.

309

A bit over half of the total cost of hypertension illness was contributed by direct medical and direct

310

non-medical costs. Most of the direct costs were due to drugs followed by accommodation and

311

transportation. In the study setting, direct medical cost accounted of 29% of the direct cost of

312

hypertension illness. A comparable result was also reported in other settings in which much of the

313

cost of hypertension illness was attributed to medicines(21–23,26,32,33). This might be related to

314

the high cost of hypertension drugs and this implied a higher rates of catastrophic costs on

315

hypertension patients.

316

Nonetheless, the indirect costs of hypertension illness were also equally important. These costs

317

included the time spent by patients and their companion, and expressed as lost work days. The

318

majority of patients had companion and the mean forgone earning by the companion due to

319

hypertension illness was US$ 6.2. The estimated average annual indirect cost of hypertensive

320

illness was US $ 130.7 and this is lower than a report from Kenya(23). However, the indirect cost

321

of hypertensive illness was high in the study area and it accounted of 49% of the total cost of

322

illness. Indirect cost of hypertensive illness was attributed to the travel time to the hospital and

323

absent from work. This indicates the need for expanding hypertension management centers and

324

enhancing the control of hypertension in a community. In Ethiopia the coverage of non-

325

communicable diseases management services was low and increasing steadily (34).

326

The cost of hypertension illness was determined by educational status, distance from the hospital,

327

presence of companion and the stage of hypertension illness. The cost of hypertension illness was

328

higher in no educated patients than the primary level education patients. This might be due to the

329

reason that in the study setting most of the patients with a no educational status were at stage two

330

of hypertension and the complications related to hypertension may let them to cost more. The total

331

cost of hypertension was also associated with the presence of companion and distance to hospital.

332

With a unit increase in distance to hospital, the cost of hypertension illness increased by about

333

0.003 US $. This is due to the fact that the companion consumption (food and transport) and the

334

transportation cost of patients to visit hospitals may increases the total cost of hypertension illness.

335

Likewise, patients who were in stage two of hypertension have a higher cost of illness than those

336

in the prehypertension stage. This implies that the complications of hypertension is a significant

337

contributor to increase in the cost of illness and this warrants the early diagnosis and management

338

of hypertension. Our findings are comparable to other reports elsewhere(21,32).

339

Though our study have a many strengths, it has also some limitations. The cost of illness analysis

340

was limited to patient’s perspective and doesn’t addressed other costs of the health system (such

341

as costs related to the provider, family and society at large). Moreover, the intangible cost (costs

342

of pain, suffering, stigma and discrimination) associated with hypertensive illness were not also

343

addressed in our study.

344

Conclusion

345

Overall, this study have revealed that the total cost of hypertension illness was high in the study

346

area. The mean total cost of hypertension illness was high compared to the mean monthly income

347

of patients and households, letting patients to catastrophic costs. Unless urgent measures were

348

taken, the increased prevalence of hypertension combined to the high cost of hypertension

349

management in Ethiopia may bare individuals to financial hardships. Thus, the government should

350

take attention in preventing further catastrophic costs resulted from the complications and

351

mortality of hypertension.
