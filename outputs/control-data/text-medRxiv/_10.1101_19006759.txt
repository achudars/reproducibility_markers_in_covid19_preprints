Objectives: To examine the socio-demographic correlates associated with better linear growth

among children under 5 years living in poor households
Design: Cross-sectional
Setting: Ghana, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Mozambique
Participants: Singleton children aged 0–59 months, born to mothers aged 15–49 years.

Information on children was obtained through face-to-face interviews with mothers.
Primary outcome measure: Child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ), categorised into HAZ≥-2

standard deviations (SD) (better growth/not stunted) and HAZ≤-2 SD (stunted/poor growth).
Results: A unit change in maternal years of education was associated with increased odds of

better growth among children living in poor households in DRC [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=
1.03, 95% CI=1.01,1.07)], Ghana (aOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.01,1.11), Kenya (aOR=1.03, 95% CI= 1.01,
1.05) and Nigeria (aOR=1.08, 95%=1.06,1.10). Maternal antenatal attendance of at least four
visits was associated positively with better child growth in DRC (aOR=1.32, 95% CI=1.05, 1.67)
and Ghana (aOR=1.67, 95% CI=1.19, 2.33). The association did not reach statistical significance
in the remaining three countries. In Ghana, Mozambique and DRC, breastfeeding was
associated significantly with the likelihood of better linear growth when only sociodemographic correlates were included in the models, but disappeared after the inclusion of
child level covariates. In Nigeria, maternal normal weight was associated with increased odds
(aOR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08, 1.43) of better growth among children living in poor households, so
was overweight (aOR=1.51, 95% CI= 1.24, 1.83). In all the countries except Ghana, child
biological factors such as sex and age were associated with reduced odds of better linear
growth.
Conclusions: The socio-demographic factors included in this analysis have the potential to

promote linear growth of children under 5 years living in poor households. Interventions aimed
at promoting linear growth among children living in poverty should target at enhancing these
factors.

Strengths and limitations of this study
•

Use of large nationally representative provides more robust estimates of associations
between socio-demographic factors and better child growth

•

The height data used to compute the HAZ were objectively measured, thereby reducing
possible misclassification

•

Use of multi-country data helped unmask differences and commonalities in the effects
of the correlates on HAZ across countries

•

Focus on factors that promote better child growth rather than risks factors for child
growth deficiencies is a novelty

•

The use of cross-sectional surveys may not allow to establish causation

Introduction

Childhood malnutrition is a major public health problem confronting countries across the globe.
It is estimated that globally, childhood stunting (short stature for age), an important
undernutrition metric, reduced from 34% to 27% between 1990 and 2000 (1). The trend is
predicted to reduce to 22% in the next decades (2). Despite global-level progress in the
reduction of the problem during the past decades (1), Africa has not seen much improvement
in childhood stunting. For example, the prevalence of stunting declined marginally from 40.5%
in 1980 to 35.2% in 2000 (3) , and between 1990 and 2010 the prevalence in Africa stagnated at
about 40% (2). The consequences of stunting on the later life of the child is well known. Indeed,
there is a strong evidence that stunting can have long-term effects on cognitive development,
school achievement, economic productivity in adulthood and maternal reproductive outcomes
(2, 4-6). Stunting is also a condition that may be very difficult to reverse (4). Given the negative
consequences of stunting on child health outcomes, the international community has paid a
considerable attention to the problem . For instance, the World Health Assembly Resolution
(2012) set a 40% reduction in the number of children under-5 who are stunted as one of the six
global nutrition targets for 2025 (2, 7). This undernutrition metric is also captured in
Sustainable Development Goals (8). This suggests the need for strong investment in nutrition
interventions to address childhood stunting, as averting stunting could produce life-long
benefits. To achieve this goal however, a better understanding of the factors that promote child
growth is necessary, which will provide evidence for the design of effective nutrition
intervention. The present study is set out to provide this evidence by focusing on factors that
promote child growth rather than risk factors of child growth deficiencies.

The evidence further suggests that children in low and middle-income countries have been
known to be disproportionately affected by stunting due to poverty, lack of food and high
incidence of infectious diseases among others (2, 3, 9, 10). In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), several
countries are confronted with high prevalence of stunting among children under five years of
age (2, 3, 10). The problem is particularly more severe among children living in poor households

(10-12)--they tend to have the highest prevalence of childhood stunting (10).This is the case
because poverty creates conditions that favour poor child growth outcomes and prevents
affected populations from obtaining adequate access to prevention and care (10). Despite the
fact that children in the poor environments/households are most affected by stunting, due to
the precarious nature of their living conditions, there are some children who live in the same
conditions
or even worse yet have positive growth outcomes comparable to
children living in privilege households anywhere in the world (13-16). The questions this paper
intends to address is why are some children in poor households growing well although they are
faced with similar adversity as those who are stunted? What are the possible factors at the
individual, household and community levels that help them to have better growth outcomes?
Understanding this will help design programmes that will promote the growth of children in
very poor households or environments.
(positive deviants)

The concept of
“

positive deviance

(as referenced above) is based on the observation that in

every community there are certain individuals or groups whose uncommon behaviours and

strategies enable them to find better solutions to problems than their peers, while having access

. Positive deviance (PD) is
founded on the idea that the most appropriate solutions to challenges are not found externally,
but rather already exist within a given population(19, 20). PD aims to study the behaviours and
characteristics of those who achieve better results on a given health outcome than their peers
who reside in the same community (19).The PD approach has been used previously to
investigate newborn care, child nutrition, safe sexual practices, malaria control, health service
delivery and educational outcomes in many settings (21-29). It is a well-established concept and
can be explored using a statistical approach, and often quantified as those who do not
experience a negative outcome of interest compared to those around them with the same
resources (19). Using the PD approach can be useful because it studies the ‘positive’ aspects of
an outcome or community instead of the ‘negative’, and can identify potential points of
intervention. The
in the present study are children who live in poor
households and yet growing well relative to their counterparts who live in the same

to the same resources and facing similar or worse challenges”(17, 18)

environment but are stunted. The main objective of this study is to examine the factors
associated with better growth outcomes among children living in poor households. This
resource focused approach moves away from the dominant risk model approach, where the
focus is usually on risk factors of child growth deficiencies. Using the PD approach will help
understand the drivers of better child growth and interventions to effectively promote these
drivers in poor households.
Methodology
Data sources and sampling strategy

We analysed the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) (30) data from Ghana (2014), Kenya
(2014), Nigeria (2013), Mozambique (2011) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (20132014). The selection of these five countries was informed by our previous work (31, 32). The
DHS data are nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional household surveys collected
primarily in lower- and middle-income countries every 5 years using standardized
questionnaires to enable cross-country comparisons (33, 34). The DHS utilises a two-stage
sample design (35-39). The first stage involves the selection of sample points or clusters from
an updated master sampling frame constructed from National Population and Housing Census
of the respective countries. The clusters are selected using systematic sampling with probability
proportional to size. Household listing is then conducted in all the selected clusters to provide a
sampling frame for the second stage selection of households. The second stage selection
involves the systematic sampling of the households listed in each cluster, and households to be
included in the survey are randomly selected from the list. The rationale for the second stage
selection is to ensure adequate numbers of completed individual interviews to provide
estimates for key indicators with an acceptable precision. All men and women aged 15-59 and
15-49 respectively, in the selected households (men in half of the households) are eligible to
participate in the surveys if they were either usual residents of the household or visitors
present in the household on the night before the survey.

Study participants

Our study population comprised singleton children aged 0–59 months, born to mothers aged
15–49 years. Information on children was obtained through face-to-face interviews with
mothers. Height was measured with an adjustable measuring board calibrated in millimetres.
Children younger than 24 months were measured lying down (recumbent length) on the board,
while standing height was measured for older children. The height data were converted into Zscores based on the 2006 WHO growth standards (40). The total samples used in the current
analysis were: Ghana, n= 1,453; Nigeria, n= 10,378; Kenya, n= 4,967; Mozambique, n= 3,487;
and DRC, n= 3,979.

Ethics statement

The DHS obtained ethical clearance Government recognised Ethical Review
Committees/Institutional Review Boards of the respective countries as well as the Institutional
Review Board of ICF International, USA, before the surveys were conducted. Written informed
consent was obtained from the mothers of the children before participation. The authors of this
paper sought and obtained permission from the DHS program for the use of the data. The data
were completely anonymized and therefore the authors did not seek further ethical clearance
before their use.
Patient and Public Involvement statement

We used completely anonymised secondary data for the analysis. Therefore, no patients or
public involvement can be reported.

We used the child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) as the indicator of child linear growth in the
analysis. For all datasets, HAZ scores were computed using the 2006 WHO growth standards
(40). The HAZ was reclassified into better linear growth/not stunted and stunted/poor growth.
Children who have HAZ above -2 SD (HAZ>=-2SD) (40, 41) were considered having a better
linear growth and described as
. Similarly, children who have HAZ below –2 SD
from the median HAZ of the WHO reference population (HAZ<–2) (40) were considered stunted
(chronically malnourished) or having a poor linear growth.
positive deviants

Stratification variable

The household wealth index (WI) was used as the stratification variable. The WI has been used
in many DHS reports to measure inequalities in household characteristics, in the use of health
and other services, and in health outcomes (34, 35, 37, 42). It is an indicator of wealth that is
consistent with expenditure and income measurement among households (33, 34, 37). The
index in the DHS dataset was created based on assets ownership and housing characteristics of
each household: type of roofing, and flooring material, source of drinking water, sanitation
facilities, ownership of television, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile among others. Principal
component analysis is then employed to assign weights to each asset in each household. The
asset scores are summed up and individuals ranked according to the household score. The WI is
then divided into quintiles: poorest, poorer, middle, richer and richest (33, 34, 37). In this
paper, we recoded poor and poorest into poor/worse-off households. All the analyses were
restricted to children living in these households.

Analytical framework

The conceptual framework underpinning our empirical analysis is the widely used UNICEF
conceptual framework (43), which outlines the causes of undernutrition. This is a social
ecological framework encompassing factors at the individual, household and societal levels. In
the UNICEF framework, child malnutrition can be analysed in terms of immediate, underlying
and basic causes. The immediate causes are inadequate dietary intakes and infectious disease,
the underlying causes are inadequate maternal and childcare, inadequate health services and

health environment and the basic causes are institutional and socio-economic determinants
and potential resources (43). However, the present analysis was guided by the extended
UNICEF conceptual framework for childcare, survival, growth and development (43, 44). The
extended UNICEF framework suggests that child survival, growth and development are
influenced by a web of factors, with three underlying factors being food security, healthcare
and a healthy environment, and care for children and women (44). These underlying factors are
in turn influenced by basic factors. These basic factors may be described as “exogenous”
factors, which influence child nutrition through their effect on the intervening proximate
factors (underlying factors). In effect, the underlying factors are therefore, endogenously
determined by the exogenous factors (45).

Data analysis

In this analysis, we included only the basic factors (socio-demographic) in our empirical models.
We did this because there is evidence that in examining the association between child growth
outcomes and exogenous factors, the proximate factors are usually excluded to prevent biased
and uninterpretable parameters (45-47). Besides the basic factors, we also included antenatal
care (ANC) and breastfeeding practices, which relies mostly on exogenous public health
provisions rather than socio-demographic endowments of the household (45). The significance
of including these two variables in the model is that changes in them are likely to be more
responsive to policies, programmes and interventions rather than to changes in sociodemographic endowments of the household (45). For example, there is evidence that policy,
institutional and contextual settings are key determinants of the prevalence of breastfeeding
practices (45, 48). In the analysis, we built two regression models for each of the five countries.
In the first model, we included maternal body mass index (BMI), education, age, work status,
parity, breastfeeding status, marital status, antenatal attendance, sex of household head,
household size, number of children under five years and place of residence. We adjusted for
child dietary diversity (DD)—the details of how the DD is created can be found elsewhere (31),
age and sex in the second and final model. The selection of the explanatory variables was

informed by the UNICEF conceptual framework of child care (44). We estimated adjusted ORs
(aORs) of the effects of socio-demographic factors on child growth.
Results
Characteristics of study samples

Tables 1 presents the results of the descriptive analysis. The results showed that Ghana (76%)
has the highest number of children with better growth followed by Kenya (68%), while in
Mozambique, DRC and Nigeria, the prevalence ranged from 50% to 52%. Regarding dietary
diversity intake, Mozambique had the highest prevalence of children who consumed at least
four food groups (24%), with DRC (6%) and Nigeria (6%) having the lowest prevalence. Similarly,
Mozambique had the highest number of women with normal weight (85%). The prevalence
ranged from 68% to 76% in DRC, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. For maternal education, Ghana has
the highest prevalence (23%) of women who had attained a secondary school education, while
Mozambique has the lowest prevalence (1.20%). Higher education was less than 1% among
women in poor households across all countries. Regarding antenatal attendance among
women, DRC registered the highest prevalence (77%) followed by Ghana (59%), while Nigeria
registered the lowest prevalence (19%).

Multivariable results of the association between socio-demographic factors and better child
growth
Tables 2-6 present the results of the multivariable analysis of the association between child-

level, maternal-level, household-level and community–level factors and better linear growth

among children in five SSA countries. The results showed that a unit change in maternal years

of education was associated with increased odds of better linear growth among children in DRC

(aOR=1.03, 95% CI=1.01,1.07), Ghana (aOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.01,1.11), Kenya (aOR=1.03, 95% CI=

1.01, 1.05) and Nigeria (aOR=1.08, 95%=1.06,1.10). Antenatal attendance of at least four visits

was associated significantly with the likelihood of better child growth in DRC (aOR=1.32, 95%

Discussion
The study examined the socio-demographic factors associated with better child growth in poor

households in five sub-Saharan African Countries. We utilized

positive deviance

approach as our

analytical lens, whereby children who were growing well though living in poor households were

considered

positive deviants

. The results showed that the effects of socio-demographic factors

on child growth vary across countries. Maternal higher years of education was found to have a

significant positive effect on better linear growth among children living in poverty in DRC,

Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. This suggests that maternal education can mitigate the negative

effects of poverty on children’s nutritional status. Thus, education is an important resource for

improving child growth outcomes in the face of adversity. This may be the case because there is

evidence that education

has positive effect on child caring practices and the utilization of

health services (49-51), both of which are critical for positive child health outcomes (49, 52).

The findings in the present study are in line with the literature (51, 53). A study using data from

three SSA countries showed that

higher levels of maternal education reduced the odds of child

stunting (53). The literature together with the present study, though using slightly different

analytical approaches, demonstrated the importance of education in improving child growth

outcomes.

promoting ANC attendance among women can have a beneficial effect not only on the mothers

but also their offspring. Therefore, interventions to promote child growth in poor environments

should incorporate ANC as a key intervention package.

The widely recognised

benefits of breastfeeding for improved child health and developmental

outcomes (55-57) have been illuminated in this study but only when child level covariates were

not included in the empirical models of the analysis. For instance, in Ghana, Mozambique and

DRC, breastfeeding showed a significant positive effect on better child linear growth in the

models containing only the socio-demographic factors. However, this significant association

disappeared after child level covariate such as dietary diversity, age and sex were included in

the models. This suggests that whether breastfeeding will have positive effect on child

growth

in poor households or not is conditional on the inclusion or otherwise of child level co-variates.

Therefore, in examining the effects of socio-demographic factors on child linear growth, it is

significant to include child level covariates to avoid presenting misleading estimates. The non-

significant positive effect of breastfeeding on child growth has previously been documented

(52, 58, 59). Indeed, Marquis and colleagues (58) observed an inverse relationship between

breastfeeding and child linear growth. They attributed this inverse relationship to what they

termed

reverse causality

—that is, the breastfeeding did not lead to poor growth but poor

growth and health led to increased breastfeeding. The conclusion is then that children's health

must be considered when evaluating the association of breastfeeding with anthropometric

outcomes (58). This supports our argument that child level co-variates should be taken into

account when investigating the effect of breastfeeding on child linear growth.

Surprisingly, in Mozambique, the widely recognised urban advantage in terms of positive health

outcomes was not observed in the present study. The analysis showed that urban place of

residence had negative effect on linear growth of children living in poor households. The reason

for this inverse relationship could be attributed to the precarious conditions under which the

urban poor live (e.g. in slums) (60). In the literature, both negative and positive effects have

been found with urban place of residence and child growth outcomes (60, 61). Some previous

studies have observed that urban children are usually taller and heavier (61, 62). However, this

may not include those children in urban poor settings, as there is evidence that they tend to

Conclusions
The study examined the effects of child, maternal, household and community level factors on

better linear growth among children in five SSA countries. The results showed that the effects

of socio-demographic factors on child linear growth vary across countries. Maternal education

Improving maternal education in poor households may have beneficial effect on child growth

outcomes. A higher number of ANC visits has significant positive effect on better child growth.

Interventions to promote linear growth among children living in poverty should incorporate

ANC as one of the key intervention packages.
