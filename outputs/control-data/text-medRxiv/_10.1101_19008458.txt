Abstract
Background: The association between loneliness and suicide is complex, poorly understood, and
there are no prior longitudinal studies. We aimed to investigate the relationship between living
alone, loneliness and emotional support as predictors of death by suicide and self-harm.
Methods: Between 2006 and 2010 UK Biobank recruited over 0.5m people aged 37-73. This data
was linked to prospective hospital admission and mortality records. Adjusted Cox regression models
were used to investigate the relationship between self-reported measures of loneliness, emotional
support and living arrangements and death by suicide and self-harm.
Results: For women, there was no evidence that living arrangements, loneliness or lack of emotional
support were associated with death by suicide. However, for men, both living alone (Hazard Ratio
(HR) 2.19 95%CI 1.47-3.27) and with non-partners (HR 2.17 95%CI 1.28-3.69) were associated with
death by suicide, independently of loneliness, which had a modest relationship with suicide in men
(HR 1.45 95%CI 0.99-2.12). Associations between living alone and self-harm were explained by
health for women, and by health, loneliness and emotional support for men. In fully adjusted
models, loneliness was associated with hospital admissions for self-harm in both women (HR 1.90
95%CI 1.58-2.29) and men (HR 1.75 95%CI 1.41-2.18).
Conclusions: For men -but not for women- living alone or with a non-partner increased the risk of
suicide, a finding not explained by loneliness. Loneliness may be more important as a risk factor for
self-harm than for suicide, and appears to mitigate against any protective effect of cohabitation.

Introduction
Loneliness, defined as the subjective perception of a lack of contact with other people (HM
Government, 2018, Perlman and Peplau, 1981), is associated with premature mortality (Elovainio et
al., 2017, Rico-Uribe et al., 2018), physical and mental ill-health, worse cognitive function (Hawkley
and Cacioppo, 2010) and increased use of health services (Dreyer et al., 2018). Given concerns about
the consequences of population ageing and greater numbers of people living alone, the UK
government has made loneliness a ministerial responsibility (HM Government, 2018). However, it is
currently not clear whether subjective loneliness per se is the primary reason why people living
alone may be at increased risk of suicidal behaviour.
Living alone has been consistently linked with self-harm and suicide (Conejero et al., 2016, Frisch and
Simonsen, 2013) but loneliness or lack of emotional support may only partly explain this relationship
(Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010). This is a complex area of research. Most studies of loneliness and
suicidal behaviour have been based only on cross-sectional data using self-reported measures of
suicidality, which may be prone to reporting biases (Beutel et al., 2017, Stickley and Koyanagi, 2016),
and only a few (case-control) studies have investigated loneliness as a potential cause of deaths by
suicide (Courtin and Knapp, 2017, Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015).
Identifying robust risk factors for suicidal behaviour is methodologically challenging for a number of
reasons, not least because suicide is a rare event (Stickley and Koyanagi, 2016). Very few prospective
studies have been sufficiently powered to be able to detect any statistically significant effect of
factors such as living alone and subjective loneliness on outcomes such as hospitalisation for selfharm and suicide. The UK Biobank cohort represents a unique opportunity to overcome these
limitations. The cohort consists of over half a million people, and the baseline questionnaire included
a social questionnaire with detailed questions on living arrangements, loneliness and emotional
support, in addition to key sociodemographic and health data. These data have also been linked
prospectively to hospital episode statistics and mortality records (Sudlow et al., 2015).
Our primary hypothesis was that living alone may represent an independent risk factor for self-harm
and suicide. We also set out to assess whether any observed association between living alone and
suicidal behaviour might be explained by subjective loneliness or by perceived lack of emotional
support.

Methods
Data
All adults aged between 40-70 years who were registered with the UK National Health Service (NHS)
and living within 25 miles of 22 assessment centres across England, Scotland and Wales were invited
to participate in UK Biobank at baseline, with a response rate of 5.5% (Sudlow et al., 2015). Baseline
assessments took place between 2006 and 2010 (Sudlow et al., 2015), and consisted of a single visit
lasting approximately two to three hours, including consent processes, a computerised touch screen
questionnaire, nurse interviews, and physical measurements. For all participants (n = 502,616) the
date and cause of death were sought from death certificates held within the National Health Service
Information Centre (England and Wales), and National Health Service Central Register Scotland. At
the time of analysis, mortality data were available up to the middle of February 2016. All participants
who attended a Biobank assessment centre in England (n = 448,883) were linked to Hospital Episode
statistics (HES) to obtain hospital admission records for self-harm up until March 2015. This study

covered by the generic ethical approval for UK Biobank studies from the National Health Service
National Research Ethics Service (June 17, 2011; Ref 11/NW/0382). Participants provided electronic
informed consent for the baseline assessments and the register linkage.
Outcomes
Death by suicide was defined as the act of intentionally ending one’s own life (Nock et al., 2008) and
was ascertained from death records using ICD 10 codes X60-X84 (intentional self-harm), Y10-34
(undetermined cause) as used by the UK Office for National Statistics (2016). Participants dying from
other causes of death were censored at time of death.
Hospital admissions for self-harm were defined as any act of intentional self-poisoning or self-injury
carried out by an individual irrespective of the motivation or suicidal intent (National Collaborating
Centre for Mental Health, 2012). This was assessed using the first admission for self-harm following
attendance at the UK Biobank baseline assessment centre. Hospitalization for self-harm was
assessed using ICD 10 codes X60 to-84 and Z91.5, for diagnosis and causes of admissions.
Main exposures of interest
Living arrangements (alone; husband, wife or partner; other) were assessed using data from the
baseline touch screen questionnaire. Participants were asked how many people lived in their
household. If there was more than one person, the participant was then asked how people were
related to them. If any member of the household was a spouse or partner, participants were
classified as living with a husband, wife or partner. The other category included both relatives and
unrelated people. Participants preferring not to answer these questions were coded as missing.
Loneliness was assessed using a single question from the baseline touchscreen questionnaire: “Do
you often feel lonely?” (Responses: yes, no, do not know, prefer not to answer).
Emotional Support. Participants were asked “2-4 times a week; about once a week; about once a
month; once every few months; never or almost never; Do not know; prefer not answer.)
Covariates
We included sociodemographic and health variables collected during baseline data collection which
might confound relationships between the key variables of interest and death by suicide and
hospital admissions for self-harm.
Socio-demographic variables were: sex, age (continuous), ethnicity (derived here into white British,
other) employment status, (employed, retired, other), area deprivation indicated using the
Townsend Index (continuous), education (degree; professional; NVQ, HND or HND; A level; O level;
CSE; none).
Health variables were: number of physical morbidities (zero, one, two, three or more), BMI (normal
or underweight, overweight, obese), ever seen a GP for depression (yes, no), on psychotropic
medication at baseline (yes/no based on taking medications from selected codes as baseline),
alcohol consumption (categories were combined as follows; daily/almost daily, 3-4 days a week, 1-2
times a week /once a month, special occasions/never, former), smoking status (never, previous,
current).
Statistical analysis
We first ran analyses using complete cases before using multiply imputed data. Preliminary analyses
indicated that results for living arrangements differed by gender, so subsequent analyses were
stratified by gender. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate deaths by suicide.

The proportional hazards assumption was tested for using Schoenfeld residuals. Cox proportional
hazard models were initially used for hospital admissions due to self-harm, however, the
proportional hazards assumption was found not to be met for loneliness, so data were reanalysed
using a Royston Parmar model (Royston and Lambert, 2011), with Akaike information criterion
indicating that two knots to be used to model the baseline hazard and single time varying parameter
for loneliness.
In total, six different stages of model were presented by gender for both deaths by suicide and
hospital admissions for self-harm. The first three models are presented for each of living
arrangements, loneliness, and emotional support separately. Models 1 are univarable regression
models only including each of the main independent variables. Models 2 adjust for all
sociodemographic variables, and Models 3 additionally adjust for the health variables. Model 4 adds
loneliness and Model 5 adds emotional support to Model 3. In model 6, all variables were included.
We accounted for missing data using multiple imputation by chained equations, generating twenty
imputed data sets. Given that data for hospital admissions for self-harm were constrained to people
attending baseline centres in England separate sets of imputations were conducted for died by
suicide and hospital admission for self-harm. Imputation models were stratified by gender and
included age, living arrangements, loneliness, emotional support, all variables used in the models,
the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard, survival status (Cleves et al., 2016), and additional
variables to improve model fit including household income, same sex relationship, participation in
social groups, contact with friends and family, parental depression, limiting longstanding illness and
self-rated health. These variables were not included in the main models because they either had
comparatively high rates of missing data which limited their utility in preliminary complete case
analysis, or in the case of health variables, might mediate the relationship between our exposures of
interest and outcomes. Our models were fitted to each imputed data set and combined in
accordance with Rubin’s rules. All analyses were carried out using Stata 14.2.

Results
Sociodemographic characteristics of study participants by gender are shown in table 1. There were
significant (p <0.001) gender differences for all characteristics. With respect to the main
independent variables of interest, men were more likely to cohabit, whereas women were more
likely to live alone or with non-partner(s) only. Women were somewhat more likely to report often
feeling lonely. While there was little difference between men and women with respect to having
perceived access to emotional support on a daily basis, men were much more likely to report that
they never had any emotional support. Men were much likely to have died by suicide (n=155) than
women (n=59). The percentage of participants not providing answers was very low for all variables.
Among potential confounders, men were more likely than woman to be in both the most and least
advantaged categories of the socioeconomic measures, and women generally had poorer health (see
table 1).
Death by suicide
The results of Cox proportional hazard models for deaths by suicide are shown in table 2. For men
there was initially a strong relationship, relative to cohabitation, between living alone or with a nonpartner and death by suicide, with a HR of approximately 3.5 (model 1). These associations were
attenuated after adjusting for sociodemographic factors (sex, age, ethnicity, employment status,
area deprivation and education; model 2) and health measures (physical morbidities, BMI, ever seen
GP for depression, psychotropic medication, alcohol consumption and smoking status; model 3).
Adjusting for loneliness (model 4) or emotional support (model 5) only led to a slight attenuation of

relationships, and in the final fully adjusted model (model 6) both living alone (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.19
95% CI 1.47 to 3.27) and living with a person who was not a partner (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.69)
were still strongly related to deaths by suicide. The relationship between loneliness and low levels of
emotional support and death by suicide, although relatively strong in unadjusted models (model 1),
fell after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and health. Once living arrangements were
accounted for, loneliness was only modestly associated (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.17) with death by
suicide (model 4), and lower levels of emotional support was no longer associated within model 5.
In contrast, for women, there was limited evidence of an association between death by suicide and
living arrangements, loneliness or emotional support. In unadjusted analyses, all the regression
coefficients for women were much smaller than the corresponding coefficients for men. Only
loneliness had a marginally significant association (p<0.10) and this would appear to be fully
explained by women’s health at baseline.
Finally, using models adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and health measures, we conducted
interaction tests to assess whether the relationship between living arrangements and death by
suicide was modified by loneliness or emotional support. For men, a Wald test indicated a significant
interaction (p=0.002) between living arrangements and loneliness, presented on the left side of Fig
1. Men who often experience loneliness or those who were not lonely and living alone, or with a
non-partner only, have three times the risk of dying by suicide compared to those who cohabit and
are not lonely. For women, there was no evidence of any significant interaction between living
arrangements or perceived emotional support and death by suicide.

Hospital admissions for self-harm
The results for the Royston Parmar models for associations between hospital admissions for selfharm and living arrangements, loneliness and perceived emotional support are shown in table 3.
For men, both living alone and living with a non-partner were initially associated with increased risk
of being admitted to hospital for self-harm in unadjusted analyses (model 1). The strength of these
associations was reduced after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (model 2) and health
measures (model 3). Both loneliness (model 4) and lower levels of emotional support (model 5)
explained part of the relationship between living alone and self-harm, but had a more limited role in
explaining the relationship between living with a non-partner and self-harm. In the final model,
there was no evidence of an association between living alone and self-harm, but living with a non–
partner still had a modest relationship with self-harm (HR 1.35 95%CI 1.00 to 1.82).
Women differed from men in that the two categories of living arrangements had weaker
relationships with self-harm within the unadjusted model (model 1). Furthermore, the associations
for women were explained by health (model 2). For both men and women, loneliness and lower
levels of perceived emotional support were associated with increased risk of self-harm, independent
of other factors (with the caveat that for women the relationship between lack of emotional
supports and self-harm could be explained by loneliness).
For men, in models adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and health measures, we found
significant (p=0.013) interactions between living arrangements and loneliness when hospitalization
for self-harm was the outcome. Overall, loneliness removed any protective effects of cohabitation
over living alone, such that men who were often lonely had similarly increased HRs of hospitalization
of around 2.5, irrespective of their living arrangements. In contrast, among men who did not report
loneliness, living alone was associated with a modest increase in risk of hospitalization for self-harm

(HR 1.53 95% CI 10.11 to 2.10) and a greater increase was found for those living only with nonpartners (HR 2.09 95% CI 1.39 to 3.14) (see right side of Fig 1). There was no evidence that either
loneliness or perceived emotional support moderated the relationship between living arrangements
and hospitalisation for women. Nor was there any evidence of an interaction between perceived
emotional support and living arrangement in the prediction of self-harm for men.

Discussion
Our goal was to investigate the association between living arrangements, loneliness, perceived
emotional support and subsequent risk of suicidal behaviours within a large general population
cohort in middle-age. Overall, we identified important differences between men and women. For
men, given that both living alone and living with a non-partner were both associated with an
increased risk of death by suicide, it is possible that having a partner is protective against death by
suicide. Subjective loneliness and perceived emotional support explained little of this relationship.
For women, neither living arrangements, loneliness, nor emotional support were associated with
death by suicide.
In terms of hospitalisation for self-harm as an outcome, for men the modest increased risk of selfharm among those living alone appeared to be explained by loneliness and poor emotional support.
However, men who did not live with a partner had an increased risk of self-harm, independent of
loneliness or emotional support. For women, any increased risk of self-harm appeared to be
explained by sociodemographic characteristics or health status at baseline. Both genders were
similar in that both loneliness and emotional support were associated with self-harm.
Our finding that deaths by suicide for men (and hospital admissions for self-harm for both men and
women) were associated with living arrangements, is consistent with the literature for marital status
that finds married or cohabiting people have lower risks of suicide compared to single people
(Conejero et al., 2016, Frisch and Simonsen, 2013). Demographic factors, such as the older age of the
UK Biobank sample, could explain why we did not find any associations between living arrangements
and suicide for women. Kyung–Sook and colleagues found associations between marital status and
suicide only among younger women (Kyung-Sook et al., 2018).
There are several additional novel findings from our analyses. Most studies of suicidal behaviour
focus on the concept that it is living alone that is harmful (Turecki and Brent, 2016). However, our
results indicate that both men who lived alone and with non-partners were at increased risk of dying
by suicide and self-harm. Apart from Frisch and Simonsen’s (2013) study, which indicated that
people living in households with more than 9 people had increased risk of suicide, the focus has
generally been on living alone as a risk factor, rather than other relationships. However, this is
consistent with a wider literature investigating determinants of psychological distress and
depression (Joutsenniemi et al., 2006).
Another key finding relates to the importance of loneliness and perceived emotional support as a
risk for hospitalisation for self-harm and deaths by suicide for men. While loneliness has been linked
to suicidal ideation and attempts (Stickley and Koyanagi, 2016), including within case-control studies
(Sinclair et al., 2005), our study is the first to investigate the influence of loneliness and deaths by
suicide within a longitudinal population sample of adults in middle-age.
Overall, our findings suggest that social connections (or lack of social connections) may be important
contributors to deaths by suicide and self-harm. To make inferences from these data we must
acknowledge some potential limitations. Although we had follow-up data on deaths by suicide and

hospitalisation for self-harm, our baseline measures were only recorded at a single time point and
the causal direction is impossible to determine conclusively. It is likely that the relationship between
the social connection measures and baseline health is bidirectional. However, given that the peak
age of onset for major depressive disorder is early adulthood (Myrna M. Weissman et al., 2016), we
decided to focus on a somewhat conservative approach, prioritising relationships presented in
models that have adjusted for both mental health and sociodemographic measures.
Our results add to the literature which finds that married or cohabiting people have lower risk of
suicide than single people (Conejero et al., 2016, Frisch and Simonsen, 2013), by showing that men
appear to actively benefit from living with a partner (not just from not living alone). Our results also
suggest that the associations between self-harm and living alone might be explained by loneliness
and emotional support. However, this does not appear to be the case for deaths by suicide. Men
who die by suicide may be less willing to seek treatment for poor mental health and the risk of
suicide is greater among those who never see a GP as opposed to those see a GP once a year
(Windfuhr et al., 2016), hence there may be residual confounding due to poor health. Alternatively,
the benefits of having a partner may be linked to men’s sense of masculinity and their self-image
(Scourfield et al., 2012), rather than emotional support or companionship. What is clear from the
interactions with loneliness is that feelings of loneliness override the benefits of having a partner,
and thus the focus needs to be on positive relationships, rather than simply cohabitation. Loneliness
appears to be an important factor for both men and women for self-harm, independent of socialdemographic factors and mental and physical health, even after adjusting for other social connection
measures.
The concept of ‘thwarted belongingness’ from the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide would suggest
that loneliness alongside the absence of reciprocal caring relationships could lead to self-destructive
behaviour (Van Orden et al., 2010). Our results may be consistent with this, but also raise questions
about the extent to which a lonely person can also feel that they do or do not have a reciprocal
caring relationship.
A key strength of this work is that the large baseline population allowed us to study rare outcomes.
However, despite this, there were still very few deaths by suicide events for women in this study. It
has been argued that a minimum of ten outcome events should occur per predictor variable, and
this would have been violated for model 3, which adjusted for multiple health factors, for deaths by
suicide by women. However, simulations (Vittinghoff and McCulloch, 2007) have shown this to be
too conservative and it is appropriate to include addition variables to adjust for confounding. The
lack of associations with deaths by suicide for women was evident even from the simpler models
with fewer independent variables. UK Biobank had an invitation response rate of only 5.5%, and
compared to the general population is less economically deprived and there is some evidence of a
healthy volunteer selection bias (Fry et al., 2017).
The use of administrative data has many advantages. It facilitates longitudinal follow-up of rare
outcomes, and minimises potential attrition biases. However, we were limited in our analyses by
only having self-harm hospital admissions for England (these data were not available for Wales or
Scotland). Many who self-harm do not seek help from services or, when they do, are not admitted
but reviewed at out-patients (Gunnell et al., 2005). The use of single item measures for loneliness
and perceived emotional support might also be considered a weakness of the study, but single-item
measures are considered valid (Stickley and Koyanagi, 2016) and are recommended for the study of
loneliness (HM Government, 2018).

This study raises many questions for future exploration. Our results suggest that addressing
loneliness may also reduce the risk of a person self-harming. In contrast, given that loneliness does
not appear to explain the relationship between not having a partner and death by suicide, different
lines of investigation are required. Future research could investigate the relationship between
having a partner and health seeking behaviour, or how having a partner changes how men view
themselves.
Overall, this work demonstrates that for men (but not for women) living alone or with a non-partner
increases risk of suicide, a finding not explained by perceived loneliness. It appears likely that
loneliness may be more important as a risk factor for self-harm than for suicide.
