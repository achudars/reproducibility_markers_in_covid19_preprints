ABSTRACT

47

Background: Anal squamous cell carcinoma is a rare tumor. Chemo-radiotherapy yields a 50%

48

3-year relapse-free survival rate in advanced anal cancer, so improved predictive markers and

49

therapeutic options are needed.

50

Methods: High-throughput proteomics and whole-exome sequencing were performed in 46

51

paraffin samples from anal squamous cell carcinoma patients. Hierarchical clustering was used

52

to establish groups de novo. Then, probabilistic graphical models were used to study the

53

differences between groups of patients at the biological process level.

54

Results: A molecular classification into two groups of patients was established, one group with

55

increased expression of proteins related to adhesion, T lymphocytes and glycolysis; and the

56

other group with increased expression of proteins related to translation and ribosomes. The

57

probabilistic graphical model showed that these two groups presented differences in

58

metabolism, mitochondria, translation, splicing and adhesion processes. Additionally, these

59

groups showed different frequencies of genetic variants in some genes, such as ATM, SLFN11

60

and DST. Finally, genetic and proteomic characteristics of these groups suggested the use of

61

some possible targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors or immunotherapy.

62

Conclusions: In this study, a molecular classification of anal squamous cell carcinoma using

63

high-throughput proteomics and whole-exome sequencing data was proposed. Moreover,

64

differences between the two established groups suggested some possible therapies.

65

Keywords: anal squamous cell carcinoma, whole-exome sequencing, proteomics, molecular

66

classification, personalized medicine.

Background

69

Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is a relatively rare cancer. In the United States there are

70

8,000 new estimated cases per year, accounting for approximately 2.7% of all gastrointestinal

71

cancers. Of these, more than 1,000 cases will result in death(1).

72

Since the 1970s, the standard treatment has consisted of the combination of 5-fluorouracil

73

(5FU), mitomycin C or cisplatin and radiotherapy (2). This treatment is particularly effective in

74

T1/T2 tumors, achieving complete regression in 80-90% of cases. However, in advanced anal

75

cancers (T3-4 or N+), the disease-free survival (DFS) rate is only around 50% (3). Therefore, due

76

to the lack of advances in the last years, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve

77

these outcomes.

78

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) focused on the identification of disease-causing genes is now

79

being implemented into clinical practice (4). The first work that announced entire exome

80

sequencing was published by Ng et al (5). Since then, personalized medicine has focused on

81

identifying the cause of rare diseases and cancers.

82

With the recent improvements in mass-spectrometry (MS) techniques, high-throughput

83

proteomics has made it possible to identify thousands of proteins (6). Proteins are the

84

effectors of biological processes, being closer to the phenotype than genes or transcripts. On

85

the other hand, probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) were successfully used in previous

86

studies to characterize tumors from a functional perspective (7-9). Moreover, when used in

87

combination, proteomics and genomics provide complementary information.

88

Previous studies in ASCC were focused in the characterization of genetic variants in this disease

89

using next-generation sequencing techniques. The most frequent mutated genes, such as

90

PIK3CA, FBXW7, FAT1 or ATM, were characterized (10-13). On the other hand, Herfs et al. used

91

MS proteomics in microdissected anal samples to establish differential protein expression

92

patterns depending of the location (squamous or transitional) (14). However, until date, a

93

molecular classification of ASCC has not been established

94

In this study, we combined WES with high-throughput proteomics to further characterize a

95

cohort of 46 ASCC tumors. This is the first time that a combined study of these characteristics

96

in ASCC has been done. Genomics provides information about the genetic causes of disease

97

and proteins are the ultimate effectors of biological processes. Therefore, a study of these two

98

–omics allows us to obtain a broader picture of the molecular features of ASCC tumors.

Methods

101

Patient cohort

102

Forty-six formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from patients diagnosed with ASCC

103

were analyzed by WES and MS proteomics. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee

104

of Hospital Universitario La Paz. Informed consent was obtained for all patients in the study.

105

Samples were reviewed by an experienced pathologist and all the samples included at least

106

70% invasive tumor cells. Patients were required to have a histologically-confirmed diagnosis

107

of ASCC, be 18 years of age or older; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group

108

performance status (ECOG-PS) of 0 to 2; have received no prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy

109

for this malignancy and present with no metastasis. Demographic information related to the

110

tumor and the treatments was collected. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection was

111

determined by CLART® HPV2 (Genomica).

112

DNA isolation

113

One 10 mm section from each FFPE sample was deparaffinized and DNA was extracted using

114

GeneRead DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Once

115

eluted, the DNA was frozen at -80 °C until use.

116

Protein isolation

117

Proteins were extracted from FFPE samples as previously described (15). Briefly, FFPE sections

118

were deparaffinized in xylene and washed twice with absolute ethanol. Protein extracts were

119

prepared in a 2% SDS buffer by a protocol based on heat-induced antigen retrieval. Protein

120

concentration was measured using the MicroBCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce-Thermo Scientific).

121

Protein extracts (10 µg) were digested with trypsin (1:50) and SDS was removed from the

122

digested lysates using Detergent Removal Spin Columns (Pierce). Peptides were desalted using

self-packed C18 stage tips, dried and resolubilized with 10 µl of 3% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic

124

acid.

125

Whole-exome sequencing experiments

126

WES from 46 ASCC FFPE samples was performed. The isolated DNA was evaluated by

127

Picogreen and mean size was controlled by gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was divided by

128

mechanical methods (Bioruptor) to a mean size of approximately 200 bp. At that point, DNA

129

tests were fixed, phosphorylated, A-followed and ligated to explicit connectors, trailed by PCR-

130

interceded naming with Illumina-explicit successions and test explicit standardized

131

identifications (Kapa DNA library age unit).

132

Exome capture was performed utilizing the VCRome framework (catch size of 37 Mb,

133

Nimblegen) under a multiplexing of 8 tests for every capture response. Capture was performed

134

entirely in accordance to Nimblegen enhancement instructions. After the capture, libraries

135

were cleansed, measured and titrated using Real Time PCR before sequencing. Tests were then

136

sequenced to a surmised inclusion of 4.5 Gb per test in Illumina-NextSeq NS500 (Illumina Inc.)

137

utilizing 150 cycles (2x75) High Output cartridges.

138

Raw data files were available in Sequence Read Archive (SRA,

139

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under the name PRJNA573670.

140

Bioinformatics analyses of whole-exome sequencing data

141

The quality of the WES experiments was verified using FASTQC (http://www.bioinformmatics.

142

babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). First, primers were removed using Cutadapt. Then, FASTQ

143

files were filtered by quality using PrinSeq. Both tools are available in GPRO tool (16).

144

Sequence alignment was performed using the human genome h19 as the reference and BWA

145

tools (17), Samtools (18) and Picard Tools (http://picard.sourceforge.net). Variant calling was

146

performed using the MuTect tool from the GATK4 package (19) combined with PicardTools,

147

first, to create a panel of normal samples (PON) and second, to perform the variant calling

148

(20). The PON was built using 11 samples from Iberian exomes from a 1000genomes database

149

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/).

150

Finally, variants were annotated using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) (21). The information

151

about the genetic variants provided by VEP was used to filter the genetic variants. The filtering

152

criteria were: a frequency in the general population, according gnomAD database, of less than

153

1%, a high or moderate impact, and the presence of a variant of this gene in our cohort in at

154

least 10% of the patients.

155

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis

156

MS analysis was performed using a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific)

157

equipped with a Digital PicoView source (New Objective) and coupled to a M-Class UPLC

158

(Waters). Solvent composition at the two channels was 0.1% formic acid for channel A and

159

0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile for channel B. For each sample 3 μL of peptides were

160

loaded on a commercial MZ Symmetry C18 Trap Column (100Å, 5 µm, 180 µm x 20 mm,

161

Waters) followed by nanoEase MZ C18 HSS T3 Column (100Å, 1.8 µm, 75 µm x 250 mm,

162

Waters). The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min by a gradient from 8 to 27% B

163

in 85 min, 35% B in 5 min and 80% B in 1 min. Samples were acquired in a randomized order.

164

The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA), acquiring

165

full-scan MS spectra (350−1’400 m/z) at a resolution of 120’000 at 200 m/z after accumulation

166

to a target value of 3’000’000, followed by HCD (higher-energy collision dissociation)

167

fragmentation on the twenty most intense signals per cycle. HCD spectra were acquired at a

168

resolution of 15’000 using normalized collision energy of 28 and a maximum injection time of

169

22 ms. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 100’000 ions. Charge state screening was

170

enabled. Singly, unassigned, and charge states higher than seven were rejected. Only those

171

precursors with an intensity above 110’000 were selected for MS/MS. Precursor masses

172

previously selected for MS/MS measurement were excluded from further selection for 30 s,

173

and the exclusion window was set at 10 ppm. The samples were acquired using internal lock

174

mass (22) calibration on m/z 371.1012 and 445.1200.

175

The MS proteomics results were handled using the local laboratory information management

176

system (LIMS) (22) and all relevant data have been deposited to Chorus under the project

177

name “Anal squamous cell carcinoma proteomics”.

178

Protein identification and label-free protein quantification

179

The acquired raw MS data was processed by MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.3), followed by protein

180

identification using the integrated Andromeda search engine (23). Spectra were searched

181

against a Uniprot reference proteome (taxonomy 9606, canonical version from 2016-12-09),

182

concatenated to its reversed decoyed fasta database and common protein contaminants.

183

Methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation were set as variable modifications.

184

Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin/P allowing for a minimal peptide length of 7 amino acids

185

and a maximum of two missed-cleavages. MaxQuant Orbitrap default search settings were

186

used. The maximum false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 for peptides and 0.05 for

187

proteins. Label-free quantification was enabled and a 2 minutes window for match between

188

runs was applied. In the MaxQuant experimental design template, each file is kept separate in

189

the experimental design to obtain individual quantitative values.

190

As quality criteria, the detectable measurement in at least 75% of the samples and the

191

presence of two unique peptides were applied. Log2 of the data was calculated and missing

192

values were imputed to a normal distribution using Perseus software (24).

193

Probabilistic graphical models and functional node activity

194

With the aim of studying proteomics data from a functional point of view, PGMs compatible

195

with high-dimensional data, were used. grapHD (25) and R v3.2.5 were used to generate the

196

PGM from proteomics expression without any a priori information, based on correlation as

197

associative measurement. The network was built in two steps: first, the spanning tree with

198

maximum likelihood was found and, then, the edges was chosen based on the reduction of the

199

Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and the preservation of the decomposability of the graph

200

(26). The resulting network was analyzed to define a functional structure by gene ontology

201

analyses, as in previous works (7-9). Briefly, the branches of the network were analyzed by

202

gene ontology and a majority function for each branch was assigned, thereby determining

203

different functional nodes in the network. Gene ontology analyses were performed using

204

DAVID 6.8 webtool (27) using “homo sapiens” as background and GOTERM-FAT, Biocarta and

205

KEGG as categories.

206

Once each branch had been assigned a function, functional node activities were calculated as

207

the mean of the proteins of each branch related to the main function of that branch (8, 9).

208

Then, comparisons between groups using Mann-Whitney test were done.

209

Metabolic modeling and estimation of tumor growth rate

210

Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a method used to model the flow of metabolites through

211

biochemical networks (28). It allows the growth rate or production rate of a given metabolite

212

to be estimated using as input gene or protein expression data. In this study we used the

213

whole human reconstruction Recon2 and the biomass reaction included in this model as the

214

objective function and as representative of tumor growth (29). Proteomics data was

215

introduced into the model to make accurate predictions by solving Gene-Protein-Reaction

216

rules (GPRs), which contain the relationships between genes and enzymes, using a modified

217

algorithm of Barker et al. (30) and a modified E-flux (7, 31). FBA calculations were performed

218

using the COBRA Toolbox library, available for MATLAB (32).

Statistical analyses

220

Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 6 and SPSS IBM Statistics 20. Network

221

analyses were performed using Cytoscape software. Hierarchical cluster and Significance

222

Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) were performed using MeV software. SAM analysis allows the

223

identification of differential proteins between groups by a t-test corrected by permutations

224

over the number of samples. The significance was determined using the False Discovery Rate

225

(FDR) (33). The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database

226

(https://www.cancerrxgene.org/) was used to find possible therapeutic targets. P-values are

227

two-sided and considered statistically significant under 0.05.

Results

230

Patient cohort

231

Forty-six patients diagnosed with non-metastatic ASCC were recruited for this study. Twenty-

232

eight patients came from the VITAL clinical trial (GEMCAD-09-02, NCT01285778), treated with

233

panitumumab, 5FU, Mitomycin C, and radiotherapy. The other 18 patients were included from

234

the routine clinical practice at Hospital Universitario La Paz and Hospital Clinic and were

235

treated with cisplatin-5FU or Mitomycin C-5FU, and concomitant radiotherapy.

236

For the survival analyses, 4 patients that could not receive chemo-radiotherapy were excluded

237

(two of them had stage I anal carcinomas, and the other two had stage III tumors). The median

238

follow-up was 33.18 months (5.53-116.4) and there are 13 relapse events. All clinical

239

characteristics are shown in Table 1.

240

Whole-exome sequencing experiments

241

Forty-six FFPE samples were analyzed by WES. The mean coverage of the samples was 42.6x,

242

with the exception of one sample that presented a coverage of 3.57x. This sample was

243

dismissed from the subsequent analyses. Once this sample was dismissed, all the samples

244

presented a mapping efficiency of 90-98%, with the exception of one sample (with a mapping

245

efficiency of 75.4%). Human exome has > 195,238 exonic regions, of which only 23,021

246

(11.21% of the human exome) have not been mapped in any sample.

247

After VEP analysis and filtering, 382 genes that presented a genetic variant with high or

248

moderate impact in at least 10% of our cohort were identified (Sup Table 1). These genes were

249

mostly related to DNA repair, chromatin binding and focal adhesion processes. PIK3CA was

250

mutated in the 40% of the patients of our cohort, FBXW7 in 16%, FAT1 in 18%, and ATM was

251

mutated in 27% of the patients. Figure 1 summarizes the high and moderate impact alteration

252

landscape in ASCC.

253

Proteomics experiments

254

After dismissing one sample in the WES experiments, 45 FFPE samples were analyzed by MS

255

and 6,035 proteins were identified. After applying quality criteria (detectable measurement in

256

at least 75% of the samples and at least two unique peptides), 1,954 proteins were used for

257

the subsequent analyses.

258

De novo identification of groups based on differential proteomics profiles

259

With the aim of defining de novo molecular groups of patients, a hierarchical cluster was used.

260

Two different molecular groups were obtained. A SAM was performed to define the

261

differential proteins between these two groups, yielding 318 proteins which were differentially

262

expressed between these groups (Sup Table 2). Group 1 underexpressed proteins related to

263

translation and ribosomal processes and overexpressed proteins related to metabolism,

264

specially glycolysis, T lymphocytes, and adhesion. On the other hand, Group 2 underexpressed

265

proteins related to metabolism, T lymphocytes, and adhesion processes and overexpressed

266

proteins related to translation and ribosomes (Figure 2).

267

With respect to the clinical data distribution between these two groups, both were

268

comparable; there were no significant differences in the distribution of clinical parameters

269

(Sup Table 3). In addition, there were not significant differences in disease-free survival or

270

overall survival (Sup Fig 1).

271

A search in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database

272

(https://www.cancerrxgene.org/) suggested RAC1 (overexpressed in Group1 and

273

underexpressed in Group 2) as a possible therapeutic target. The drug associated with this

274

gene is EHT-1864.

276

To study proteomics data from a functional perspective, a PGM was created using the 1,954

277

proteins obtaining from the MS experiments. The resulting network was divided into 10

278

functional nodes, one of them with an overrepresentation of two biological functions

279

(metabolism and mitochondria) (Figure 3).

280

Then, functional node activities were used, as in previous works (7-9), to study the differences

281

in biological processes between the two identified groups of patients. There were significant

282

differences between the two groups in membrane category, in the two nodes related to

283

metabolism, and in the nodes associated with adhesion, ribosomes, translation, extracellular

284

matrix and splicing (Figure 4).

285

Metabolism nodes

286

We found two different nodes related to metabolism, both of which showed a higher

287

expression in Group 1. The metabolism 1 node was formed by 158 proteins, mostly related to

288

mitochondrial metabolism, especially the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Among them, three were

289

also identified as differentially expressed by the SAM analysis: P09622 (DLD), P06744 (GPI) and

290

P14550 (AKR1A1). The metabolism 2 node included 104 proteins related to mitochondria and

291

metabolism, especially oxidative phosphorylation, such as P04406 (GAPDH), P06733 (ENO1),

292

P07954 (FH) or Q9UI09 (NDUFA12).

293

Adhesion node

294

The adhesion node showed a higher expression in Group 1. The adhesion node included 654

295

proteins, 25 of them classified by SAM as differentially expressed between the two groups of

296

patients.

299

Using a Chi-squared test, the frequencies of genetic variants for each gene were compared to

300

determine whether the groups of patients defined using proteomics data also showed

301

differences in genetic variants. Twelve genes presented different frequencies of genetic

302

variants between the two groups (Figure 5).

FBA allows for the comparison of the tumor growth rate between groups of tumors. The tumor

growth rate predicted for Group 1 was significantly higher than the tumor growth rate

predicted for Group 2 (Figure 6).

Discussion

309

ASCC is an infrequent tumor. With no targeted therapy yet established, the molecular

310

characterization of these tumors is still necessary. In this study, we combined the two main –

311

omics, WES and proteomics, to further characterize a cohort of 46 patients diagnosed with

312

primary ASCC. To our knowledge, this is the first study combining WES and proteomics in

313

ASCC. The results of this study allow us to establish two molecular subgroups in ASCC with

314

different molecular features. Moreover, the analyses of these two groups pointed out some

315

drug-susceptible processes, such as metabolism, and suggested other possible therapeutic

316

targets, like ATM and its relationship with PARP inhibitors (PARPi).

317

Previous studies have analyzed both primary and metastatic ASCC paraffin samples using WES

318

or gene panels (10-13). A previous study using proteomics data to characterize different

319

locations of anal cancer was also existed (14). However, this is the first study that performs

320

proteomics experiments in localized ASCC samples and combines proteomics data with WES

321

information. Previous WES studies served to identify frequently-occurring mutations in this

322

disease, including mutations in the PIK3CA, FBXW7, FAT1 and ATM genes (11-13). In our

323

cohort, PIK3CA presented a genetic variant with a high or modifier impact in 40% of the

324

patients, FBXW7 in 16%, FAT1 in 18%, and ATM in 27% of the patients.

325

Using proteomics data and HCL, it was possible to establish two different molecular groups of

326

patients. Differential proteins were mainly related to the metabolism of glucose, translation

327

and ribosomes, T lymphocytes and adhesion. Although these molecular groups have not been

328

associated with any clinical or prognostic features, these processes may be relevant in the

329

development of new therapeutic strategies. For instance, those tumors that overexpressed

330

proteins related to glycolysis may be candidates for drugs targeting metabolism such as

331

metformin, which has been shown to have cytostatic effects on other tumors, such as breast

332

or bladder carcinoma (7). On the other hand, one of the main differences between these two

333

groups is that Group 1 had a higher expression of proteins related to T lymphocytes. With the

334

bloom of immunotherapies, immune proteins have acquired great relevance. Therefore, this

335

group of patients may be good candidates for immunotherapy. In fact, nivolumab has been

336

reported to be an effective therapy in metastatic ASCC and its efficacy is related to the

337

presence of cytotoxic T cells (34). Moreover, pembrolizumab has demonstrated its antitumor

338

activity in PD-L1-positive advanced ASCC (35).On the other hand, the search in Genomics of

339

Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database to establish possible therapeutic targets suggested RAC1

340

(overexpressed in Group 1 and underexpressed in Group 2) as a potential therapeutic target.

341

RAC1 has as associated drug, EHT-1864, which affects the cytoskeleton (36).

342

In addition, MS experiments and PGMs allow for the functional characterization of these two

343

groups of patients. In this functional analysis, differences in metabolism were confirmed.

344

There were also differences at the mitochondria level, which is the target for metformin.

345

Metabolism nodes showed a higher expression in Group 1. P06744 (GPI, glucose 6-phosphate

346

isomerase), included in the metabolism 1 node, is the enzyme that converts glucose –

347

phosphate into fructose 6-phosphate and a higher expression has been associated with

348

tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in gastric cancer (37).

349

The adhesion node also had a higher expression in Group 1 and contained 25 proteins

350

identified by SAM as differentially expressed. P46940 (IQGAP1) has been associated with poor

351

prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (38) and has also been associated with

352

response to chemo-radiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinomas (39). P27797 (CALR) induces an

353

immune response in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (40). P08133 (ANXA6) promotes

354

EGFR deactivation (41). P62829 (RPL23) negatively regulates apoptosis and also inhibits growth

355

in colorectal cancer (42). On the other hand, RPL23 has been identified as an oncogene in head

356

and neck squamous cell carcinoma (43). O43707 (ACTN4) increases cell motility and invasion in

357

colorectal cancer (44). Previous studies have described how P84077 (ARF1) forms a complex

18

358

with EGFR and promotes invasion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (45). P35579

359

(MYH9) plays an important role in adhesion and migration, and its overexpression is correlated

360

with metastasis in colorectal cancer through the MAPK pathway (46) . Aberrant activity of

361

P63000 (RAC1), which is involved in metastasis and proliferation, is a hallmark in cancer, (47).

362

At the same time, O75131 (CPNE3) promotes cell migration through RAC1 (48). Finally, P61586

363

(RHOA), a tumor suppressor gene, plays a relevant role in colorectal cancer, being associated

364

with metastasis and is deactivated in a significant number of colorectal tumors (49).In

365

conclusion, the majority of the proteins included in this adhesion node play well-established

366

roles in metastasis processes.

367

Moreover, the combination of the proteomics and genetic variants information showed that

368

the two molecular groups defined by proteomics also had a different mutational profile. Group

369

2 showed a higher frequency of ATM genetic variants. Previous studies have described a high

370

response rate to PARPi, as olaparib, in prostate tumors with mutations in ATM (50). Therefore,

371

Group 2 patients may also be candidates for the treatment with PARPi.

372

In addition, FBA predicted a higher tumor growth rate for Group 1 than for Group 2. It may be

373

possible that, given their higher proliferation, the tumors of Group 1 may also be more

374

responsive to chemotherapy.

375

This study has some limitations. The results need to be validated in an independent cohort.

376

The information in ASCC is scarce so a prospective validation will be needed. The number of

377

proteins detected by MS still needs technical improvement to be considered to be at the same

378

level as genomics. However, proteomics offers a more direct measurement of the effectors of

379

biological processes. Finally, a consensus analysis pipeline to apply in cancer sequencing data is

380

still necessary.

382

In conclusion, two different molecular groups of patients have been proposed based on

383

proteomics expression. This may be the first step toward a personalized therapy approach in

384

ASCC. In addition, some possible targeted therapies, such as PARPi or immunotherapy,

385

according to the molecular features (genetic and protein-based) defined in the two proteomics

386

groups were suggested.
