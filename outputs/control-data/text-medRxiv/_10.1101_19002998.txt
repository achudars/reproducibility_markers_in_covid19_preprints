Abstract (235 words)
Objective. Identify preferred neurofilament assays, and clinically validate serum NfL and
pNfH as prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers relevant to ALS therapy
development.

Methods. Prospective, multi-center, longitudinal observational study of patients with
ALS (n=229), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, n=20) and progressive muscular atrophy
(PMA, n=11). Biological specimens were collected, processed and stored according to
strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) 1. Neurofilament assays were performed in
a blinded manner by independent contract research organizations (CROs).

Results. For serum NfL and pNfH measured using the Simoa assay, missing data (i.e.
both technical replicates below the lower limit of detection (LLD) was not encountered.
For the Iron Horse and Euroimmun pNfH assays, such missingness was encountered in
~4% and ~10% of serum samples respectively. Mean coefficients of variation (CVs) for
pNfH in serum and CSF were ~4-5% and ~2-3% respectively in all assays. Baseline NfL
concentration, but not pNfH, predicted the future ALSFRS-R slope and survival.
Incorporation of baseline serum NfL into mixed effects models of ALSFRS-R slopes
yields an estimated sample size saving of ~8%. Depending on the method used to
estimate effect size, use of serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH) as pharmacodynamic
biomarkers, instead of the ALSFRS-R slope, yields significantly larger sample size
savings.

Conclusions. Serum NfL may be considered a clinically validated prognostic biomarker
for ALS. Serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH), quantified using the Simoa assay, have
potential utility as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of treatment effect.

Introduction
Therapy development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is challenging for many
reasons, with the design and interpretation of phase II studies especially so 2. These
“mid-development” studies typically employ traditional clinical measures such as
survival or the rate of decline of the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R)
as the principal measures of therapeutic effect, but are typically underpowered, making
it difficult to decide which experimental therapeutics to advance from phase II to phase
III 3. Biomarkers with prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic utility have great
potential to help overcome these challenges 3, 4. Controlling for prognostic biomarkers,
for example, might reduce phenotypic heterogeneity, thereby improving statistical power
for a fixed sample size. Similarly, pharmacodynamic biomarkers may help to verify
target engagement or demonstrate the presence of the intended biological effect.
Neurofilaments – both light (NfL) and phosphorylated heavy (pNfH), in blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) – have been proposed as potential ALS biomarkers with
diagnostic value5-9, utility in predicting prognosis6-8, 10-15, and as possible
pharmacodynamic biomarkers16, 17. The potential diagnostic utility aside, which is not
the focus of this paper, the precise role of neurofilaments as prognostic or
pharmacodynamic biomarkers in ALS trials is not yet fully defined. Several questions
remain unresolved: Which pNfH assay, among the many available, should be selected?
Do NfL and pNfH convey the same information, or should both be measured?
Moreover, understanding the prognostic value of neurofilaments has been hampered by
the use of estimated rather than measured rates of disease progression through
longitudinal follow-up; and inconsistent consideration of the value added by
neurofilaments to clinical predictors of prognosis (age, gender, bulbar onset, etc.).
Similarly, studies of the longitudinal trajectories of neurofilaments have reached
inconsistent conclusions about their relationship to clinical measures of disease
progression, driven in part by relatively small participant numbers.

Here we present NfL and pNfH data (obtained from serum and CSF) from a large cohort
of patients with ALS and related disorders who have undergone careful longitudinal
clinical phenotyping along with serial collection of biological samples. Serum and CSF

neurofilaments have been quantified using a variety of assays, performed by CROs
blinded to participant identity and status. Combined with carefully collected phenotypic
data, we have endeavored to address unanswered questions related to the prognostic
and potential pharmacodynamic utility of neurofilament levels.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
Patients with ALS and related disorders were enrolled at multiple centers, through the
Phenotype-Genotype-Biomarker study of the Clinical Research in ALS and Related
Disorders for Therapeutic Development (CReATe) Consortium. Rigorously standardized
clinical assessments and biological sample collections were performed every 3-6
months. Samples included in this experiment were from study visits that took place
between April 2015 and November 2017.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents
The Phenotype-Genotype-Biomarker study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02327845). The University of Miami IRB (the central-IRB for CReATe) approved
the study; all participants provided written informed consent.

Sample Collection, Processing and Storage
Blood was collected in serum-separating BD-vacutainers and allowed to clot upright at
room temperature for 1-2 hours. Following centrifugation (1750g for 10 minutes at 4°C)
serum was aliquoted into cryogenic sterile freestanding conical microtubes (Nalgene or
Bio Plas Inc.) and stored at -80°C. CSF was collected in polypropylene tubes,
centrifuged (1750g for 10 minutes at 4°C), aliquoted into polypropylene cryogenic sterile
freestanding conical microtubes, frozen within ~30 minutes of collection, and stored at 80°C.

Neurofilament Quantification
Serum and CSF neurofilament concentrations were quantified by Quanterix using their
Simoa NfL18, 19 and pNfH assays20; each plate contained calibrators (0-500 pg/mL for

NfL and 0-2000pg/ml for pNfH) and quality controls. Samples were diluted to fall within
the range of the standard curve. Serum and CSF pNfH were also quantified by Iron
Horse Diagnostics, using their in-house assay (which uses monoclonal capture and
polyclonal detection antibodies)11 and the Euroimmun CE marked ELISA21 (which
reverses the capture and detection antibodies). All samples were measured in duplicate
at the same dilution, and all assays were performed blind to clinical parameters.

Statistical Analysis
Symptom onset was defined as the first occurrence of limb weakness, dysarthria,
dysphagia, or dyspnea. ∆FRS was calculated by subtracting baseline ALSFRS-R from
48 (maximum ALSFRS-R score), divided by time (months) from symptom onset to
baseline 22. Survival duration was defined as time from symptom onset to PAV (≥22
hours/day non-invasive ventilation), tracheostomy or death.

Each sample was assayed twice to generate two replicates on each platform. We then
computed (a) the number of samples for which neurofilament levels were below the
LLD, (b) the mean difference and 95% confidence interval of the differences between
replicates (i.e. limits of agreement 23), and (c) the coefficients of variation (CVs) between
replicates. The association between serum and CSF concentrations was assessed
using Spearman’s rank correlation. These analytic characteristics were qualitatively
compared between assay platforms and guided our selection of one of the pNfH assays
for further investigation.

To evaluate the prognostic utility of serum NfL and pNfH, we fitted a linear model to
estimate the change in ALSFRS-R for each subject over time, using only the subset of
participants with at least three ALSFRS-R scores. The associations between ALSFRSR slope estimates and pre-specified clinical and baseline neurofilament predictor
variables were investigated using multivariable regression. To assess the joint
contribution of NfL and pNfH, a likelihood ratio test was used to compare the full model
(including clinical and neurofilament variables) to a reduced model (including only
clinical variables). The prognostic value of serum neurofilaments was also evaluated by

Kaplan-Meier (univariate) and Cox regression (multivariate) methods, using PAV- and
tracheostomy-free survival as the outcome.

We then estimated trajectories of changes in neurofilament levels over time using linear
regression fitted separately to data from each subject. This model, which was limited to
subjects with at least three available neurofilament values, included neurofilament as
the outcome variable and time as predictor variable. Because neurofilament values
were heavily skewed, natural logarithm-transformation was used to help achieve
normality. We also estimated the impact of age in our cohort, using the same linear
regression analysis described in Disanto et al. (2017). Briefly, a linear model with log
neurofilament as the dependent variable, age as independent variable was fit to the
baseline dataset. The estimated regression coefficient for age was then back
transformed to the original scale, so that it reflects multiplicative effects (i.e., an estimate
of 1.05 means an increase of ~5% in neurofilament).

To assess the impact of considering baseline serum NfL on the sample size for a
placebo-controlled clinical trial with ALSFRS-R slope as its primary outcome, we
conducted a simulation similar to that described by Kuffner24. Briefly, we compared two
mixed effects models, typically used for assessing treatment effects on ALSFRS-R
slopes in clinical trials: Model-1 included ALSFRS-R scores as the outcome variable,
time, time x group (treatment vs. controls), log(baseline NfL), time x log(baseline NfL) as
fixed effects as well as random subject effects to account for correlations from repeated
measures in the same subjects; Model-2 is the same as Model 1, but without variables
involving NfL. 1000 simulations were performed. For each simulation, treatment group
assignment was simulated at random, which assigned half of the patients with ≥3
ALSFRS-R scores (n=53) to the treatment group and the remaining to the control group.
With ଵ and ଶ representing the estimated standard errors of time x group effects in
Model-1 and Model-2, respectively, the percent reduction in sample size is proportional
to the reduction in variance given by 100  1   ଵ ଶ / ଶ ଶ .

We also explored the utility of using serum NfL and pNfH as biomarkers to detect
pharmacodynamic effect in a phase-2 clinical trial. Sample size estimations for such a
trial required us to define a difference (or change) in serum neurofilament that might be
regarded as clinically meaningful and which a future trial would need to be powered to
detect. First, we considered the difference in serum neurofilament between fast and
slow progressing patients (ALSFRS-R rate of decline >1 and <0.5 point/month,
respectively), reasoning that this difference in neurofilament could be considered
meaningful since it corresponds to a clinically important difference in rates of disease
progression. We also considered an alternative approach, in which we defined a
meaningful change based on a slope that is more negative (i.e. steeper decline) than
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of neurofilament trajectories in untreated
patients. All analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4) and R software
(https://www.r-project.org/).

Results
Study Population
A total of 260 patients (229 ALS, 11 PMA, and 20 PLS), with a total of 617 person-visits,
were included in this study (Table 1). For evaluation of the pharmacodynamic potential
of neurofilament measurements, analysis was restricted to the subset of 106 ALS, 3
PMA, and 4 PLS patients with at least 3 longitudinal biofluid collections (Table 1).

Analytic Characteristics of Neurofilament Assays in Serum and CSF
In CSF, both replicates were very infrequently below assay LLDs (i.e. undetectable);
this was true for both NfL and pNfH and in all assays. For serum, undetectable values
were infrequent using the Simoa NfL and pNfH assays, but were encountered in ~4%
and ~10% respectively of samples assayed using the Iron Horse and Euroimmun pNfH
platforms (Table 2). Agreement between technical replicates was high for all assays
except for CSF analysis using the Euroimmun assay (Table 2). The mean CVs for NfL

were ~3% in serum and CSF; and for pNfH were ~4-5% and ~2-3% for all assays in
serum and CSF, respectively. We selected the Simoa platform for subsequent analyses,
given that it had the fewest undetectable values, and good replicate agreement (low
CV) in both serum and CSF.

Baseline Neurofilament Concentrations
Initial serum concentrations of NfL were higher in the ALS group compared to those with
PMA and PLS (p<0.001; Table 1). In the ALS group, higher serum NfL was associated
with older age, higher ∆FRS, female gender, the presence of a C9ORF72 repeat
expansion, and bulbar symptom onset (all p<0.001), but not with baseline ALSFRS-R.
Higher CSF NfL levels were similarly associated with older age, higher ∆FRS, and
female gender, although not reaching statistical significance (possibly due to smaller
sample size). Higher baseline serum pNfH among ALS patients was associated with
older age (p=0.046), higher ∆FRS (p<0.001), female gender (p=0.002), and bulbar
onset disease (p=0.035), but not C9ORF72 repeat expansion status or baseline
ALSFRS-R. Higher CSF pNfH levels were also associated with a higher ∆FRS, although
not reaching statistical significance.

Correlation between Serum and CSF Neurofilament Concentrations
While CSF could more directly reflect CNS pathophysiology, serum is more easily
accessible. Therefore, we examined for each assay how well the value of serum
measurements could serve as a proxy for CSF measurements. For pNfH, the serumCSF correlations were comparable among the 3 assays albeit with weak correlations
(r=0.16 to 0.22); the serum-CSF correlation was, however, much stronger for NfL
(r=0.62, Simoa platform only).

Potential Prognostic Utility of Baseline Neurofilament Concentrations
The average (±SD) rate of decline of the ALSFRS-R was 0.65 (±0.65) points per month.
Multivariate regression analysis, with the ALSFRS-R slope as the outcome, considering
potential clinical predictors of prognosis (age, gender, C9ORF72 status, site of disease
onset, baseline ALSFRS and ∆FRS) as well as baseline serum NfL and pNfH, identified

Benatar et al (NEUROLOGY/2019/013607) 11
only ∆FRS as a meaningful clinical predictor. For every 1-point increase in the ∆FRS
(pre-slope), the ALSFRS-R rate of decline is worsened by an additional 0.43
points/month (p=0.006) (Table 3). The addition of baseline serum NfL to the model
shows that this biomarker adds prognostic value that is not already explained by known
clinical predictors. For every 1-point increase in log serum NfL level, the ALSFRS-R rate
of decline is worsened by an additional 0.42 points/month (p<0.001). By contrast,
baseline serum pNfH provided little additional prognostic value beyond the effects of
clinical predictors (p=0.17). When both NfL and pNfH were jointly considered, the
results showed that, together, these biomarkers added significantly more prognostic
values independent of clinical predictors (p=0.002, likelihood ratio test); this result,
however, was primarily driven by the effect of NfL.

In univariate survival analyses, the presence of C9ORF72 repeat expansion, higher

∆FRS at baseline, and higher baseline serum NfL levels, were each associated with
worse prognosis (shorter survival), but baseline serum pNfH levels were not (Figure 1).
In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model that considered age, gender,
C9ORF72 status, site of disease onset, baseline ALSFRS-R, ∆FRS, and baseline
serum levels of NfL and pNfH, only age, baseline ALSFRS-R, ∆FRS, and serum NfL
were significant predictors of survival (Table 3).

Potential Pharmacodynamic Utility of Longitudinal Neurofilament Concentrations
To ready the use of serum NfL and pNfH as potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers of
treatment effect in future trials, we estimated their longitudinal trajectories (and
variability of slopes). For serum NfL, the average slope was 0.011 log units/month (95%
confidence intervals [CI]: -0.054, 0.076). Consistent with prior studies 25, we also
observed a positive association between NfL and age, with 1.3% increase in NfL for
each additional year (95% CI = 0.4%-2.3%). For serum pNfH, the average slope was
0.006 log units/month (95% CI: -0.063, 0.084) (Figure 2). We also quantified the
magnitude change in biomarker concentration on the raw scale compared to baseline
(Figure 3). For serum NfL, the 90th and 95th percentiles of the maximum absolute
changes in concentration from baseline are 15 and 22pg/ml respectively. For serum

pNfH, the 90th and 95th percentiles of the maximum absolute changes in concentration
from baseline are 146 and 196pg/ml respectively.

Utility of Neurofilament Biomarkers in Reducing Sample Size for Future Clinical Trials
Since baseline NfL level is predictive of ALSFRS-R trajectories, we hypothesized that
the number of patients needed for a trial would be reduced when baseline NfL levels, as
a prognostic biomarker, are considered. This may be done by including serum NfL as a
covariate in the linear mixed models typically used to examine ALSFRS-R slopes. Using
a simulation study similar to that described by Kuffner24, we found that the sample size
for an ALS trial would be reduced by about 8.2% with the addition of baseline NfL
measurements.

Furthermore, we estimated the sample size required for a future phase-2 trial with
serum NfL (or serum pNfH) as a pharmacodynamic biomarker. We considered 2
different outcome measures and what a clinically meaningful treatment difference may
be for each: First, assuming that an experimental therapeutic would need to change the
slope of serum NfL from our observed average in the untreated state (0.011 log
units/month) to less than the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (-0.054 log
units/month) and thereby an estimated treatment difference of 0.065 log units/month,
with an estimated standard deviation of 0.048 log units/month, a total sample size of
N=26 (13 treatment, 13 placebo) would provide 90% power to detect such a treatment
difference, using a two-sample t-test with 5% significance level. Similarly, assuming that
an experimental therapeutic would need to change the slope of serum pNfH from our
observed average in the untreated state (0.006 log units/month) to less than the lower
bound of the 95% confidence interval (-0.063 log units/month) and thereby an estimated
treatment difference of 0.069 log units/month, with an estimated standard deviation of
0.046 log units/month, a total sample size of N=22 (11 treatment, 11 placebo) would
provide 90% power to detect such a treatment difference, using a two-sample t-test with
5% significance level.

Alternatively, one may wish to achieve a clinically meaningful difference in NfL (or pNfH)
levels (rather than trajectories). Based on an estimated treatment difference of 0.67
log(pg/ml)—which was our observed difference in baseline log(NfL) levels between fast
progressors (ALSFRS-R decline of >1 point/month) and slow progressors (ALSFRS-R
decline of <0.5 points/month), which were 3.10 and 2.43 log(pg/ml), respectively—and a
standard deviation of ~0.81 log(pg/ml), a total sample size of N=64 (32 treatment, 32
placebo) would provide 90% power to detect such a treatment difference, using a two
sample t-test with 5% significance level. By contrast, the much smaller difference of
0.22 log(pg/ml) between serum pNfH levels among fast and slow progressors [3.82
log(pg/ml) and 3.60 log(pg/ml) respectively], combined with a standard deviation of
~1.43 log(pg/ml), yields a total sample size of N=1778 (889 treatment, 889 placebo) in
order to provide 90% power to detect such a treatment difference, using a two sample ttest with 5% significance level

For comparison, we also similarly estimated the required sample size for a clinically
meaningful 20-30% reduction in ALSFRS-R slope, a common outcome measure
employed in ALS clinical trials 26. Based on our observed average ALSFRS-R slope of 0.648 points/month and an estimated standard deviation of 0.65 points/month, a total of
N=1054 or N=470 patients would be needed respectively to provide power for detecting
a 20% or 30% reduction in ALSFRS-R slopes.

Discussion
While much has been written about the prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic
utility of neurofilaments in ALS 7, 12, 13, 21, 27, most studies have been single-center,
measured either NfL or pNfH (but not both), used only a single assay to quantify
neurofilament levels, evaluated either blood or CSF (but not both), explored either
survival or functional decline (but not both), and rarely quantified functional decline
using prospectively collected ALSFRS-R data. Here, we have undertaken a multi-center
study with head-to-head comparison of three different pNfH assays (performed by two
different CROs) in serum and CSF, as well as an evaluation of the prognostic and

potential pharmacodynamic utility of serum NfL and pNfH, using multivariate analytic
techniques that explore the potential value neurofilaments add to readily available
clinical information. Functional decline was quantified using prospectively collected
ALSFRS-R data, as would be done in a clinical trial. We have also illustrated how serum
neurofilament data might be used to aid the design and implementation of future phase
II clinical trials.

For pNfH, the Simoa assay had the best sensitivity (fewest values below the assay LLD)
and reproducibility (lowest CV between technical replicates in both serum and CSF).
Using the Simoa assay, we also found a much stronger correlation between serum and
CSF for NfL than for pNfH. The correlations between serum and CSF in this study are
substantially lower than prior published reports 12, 21, 28. One possible explanation for this
discrepancy is that we restricted our analyses to baseline data. As discussed by Bland
and Altman, when multiple measurements taken from the same subjects are used to
compute correlation coefficients, the result can appear artificially high because
variability between measurements on the same subject are not properly accounted for
and the independence assumption of correlation is violated 23.

We also found that serum NfL is prognostic of future ALSFRS-R decline and survival
duration, providing information that is not captured by readily available clinical
predictors. While absolute values can vary between patients, serum NfL levels remain
largely stable in each subject over time. This may portend clinical utility as
pharmacodynamic biomarkers if there are detectable changes in levels following
exposure to an experimental therapeutic. This expectation is supported by recent
studies of Nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) 29, 30, though definitive proof in
adult motor neuron diseases would necessarily require an effective therapeutic to test.
Moreover, we have illustrated the ways in which use of serum NfL in a phase-2 trial
might permit a reduction in sample size. Incorporation of serum NfL as a covariate in a
trial that uses the ALSFRS-R rate of decline as the primary outcome measure would
yield a modest benefit (~8% reduction in sample size), but use of NfL as a
pharmacodynamic biomarker might offer meaningful sample size savings compared to

Benatar et al (NEUROLOGY/2019/013607) 15
more traditional phase-2 studies in which changes in the ALSFRS-R are used as the
primary outcome measure. The potential utility of serum pNfH is more nuanced. On the
one hand, we have found that it does not add prognostic value to readily available
clinical parameters and serum NfL. On the other hand, the stability of serum pNfH
suggests potential value as a pharmacodynamic biomarker but, depending on the
approach used to quantify the clinical meaningfulness of a reduction in pNfH, this may
or may not yield sample size savings in a phase-2 clinical trial setting.

The main limitation of this study is that the population may not be adequately
representative of ALS patients who would ordinarily be enrolled in a clinical trial.
Patients included in the current study were skewed towards those with more slowly
progressive disease (evidenced by an ALSFRS-R slope of -0.65 points/month).
Achieving better representation of a trial-like population is the goal of an ongoing study.
We note, however, that the longitudinal stability of neurofilaments is not a consequence
of this characteristic of the patient cohort, but rather a function of the relatively long
latency from symptom onset to study enrollment and baseline assessment, which in turn
reflects the well-described diagnostic delay that is characteristic of ALS 31. A fuller
picture temporal course of the rise in neurofilament levels has emerged from studies of
people at genetic risk for ALS, which have shown that NfL and pNfH rise in both the presymptomatic and early symptomatic periods 32, 33, with an expected plateau by the time
of enrollment in a clinical trial or cohort study such as the one described herein.

A second limitation of the current study is that we have insufficient data to reliably
comment on the value of CSF NfL and pNfH as either prognostic or pharmacodynamic
biomarkers. Notwithstanding these considerations, this was a large multi-center study
with prospective, systematic follow-up and strict SOPs for sample collection, processing
and storage. All assays were performed by independent CROs blinded to clinical data,
with comparative data generated across assay platforms, CROs and neurofilament
types.

These results support two conclusions. First, serum NfL, but not serum pNfH, may be
considered a clinically validated prognostic biomarker. Second, serum NfL (and perhaps
pNfH) may have value as potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and both should be
incorporated into ongoing and future phase-2 trials; the actual pharmacodynamic utility
of these biomarkers, however, will only become apparent once we have truly effective
treatments for ALS.

Figure Legends

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, showing the prognostic value of (A)
C9ORF72 repeat expansion, (B) ∆FRS (dichotomized at the median, 0.62points/month),
(C) baseline serum NfL (dichotomized at the median, 17pg/ml), and (D) baseline serum
pNfH (dichotomized at the median, 67pg/ml). The presence of a C9ORF72 repeat
expansion, higher ∆FRS, higher baseline serum NfL, and higher baseline serum pNfH
are shown in red.
Figure 2. Longitudinal trajectories of serum neurofilaments: (A) spaghetti plot of
log-transformed neurofilament light level (NfL), (B) spaghetti plot of log-transformed
phosphorylated neurofilament heavy level (pNfH), and (C) boxplot of the distribution of
NfL and pNfH slopes. Slope estimates were obtained from a linear model with logtransformed neurofilament level as the outcome, and time as the independent variable.
Figure 3. Change in serum neurofilaments over time, as compared to baseline
level: (A) Change from baseline serum neurofilament light (pg/ml), and (B) change from
baseline in serum phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pg/ml).
