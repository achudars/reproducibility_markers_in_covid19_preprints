Abstract
Relatives of bladder cancer (BCa) patients have been shown to be at increased risk for kidney, lung,
thyroid, and cervical cancer after correcting for smoking related behaviors that may concentrate in some
families. We demonstrate a new method to simultaneously assess risks for multiple cancers to identify
distinct multi-cancer configurations (multiple different cancer types that cluster in relatives) surrounding
BCa patients. We identified 6,416 individuals with urothelial carcinoma and familial information using
the Utah Cancer Registry and Utah Population Database (UPDB). First-degree relatives, second-degree
relatives, and first cousins were used to construct a familial enrichment matrix for cancer-types
previously shown to be individually associated with BCa. K-medioids clustering were used to identify
Familial Multi-Cancer Configurations (FMC). A case-control design and Cox regression with a 1:5 ratio of
BCa cases to cancer-free controls was used to quantify the risk in specific relative-types and spouses in
each FMC. Clustering analysis revealed 12 distinct FMCs, each exhibiting a different pattern of cancer
co-aggregation. Of the 12 FMCs, four exhibited strong familial risk of bladder cancer along with specific
patterns of increased risk of cancers in other sites (BCa FMCs), and were the focus of further
investigation. Cancers at increased risk in these four BCa FMCs most commonly included melanoma,
prostate and breast cancer and less commonly included leukemia, lung, pancreas and kidney cancer. A
network-based approach can be used with familial data to discover new phenotype clusters for BCa,
providing new directions for discovering patterns of cancer clustering.

Introduction
Relatives of bladder cancer (BCa) patients are at increased risk for kidney, lung, thyroid, and
cervical cancer after correcting for smoking related behaviors (1-4). Family history is an important risk
factor for many cancers, which may extend across cancer types (5, 6). Simultaneously assessing risks to
multiple cancers and identifying multi-cancer configurations (multiple cancer types that cluster in
relatives) surrounding BCa will help elucidate complexities of shared cancer risk across organ sites, such
as genetics or environmental exposures. Understanding multi-cancer configurations involving BCa is
important for identifying shared risk factors and for counseling families of BCa patients about risk of
other cancers.
Breast cancer (BrCa) is an exemplar for multi-cancer configurations. Approximately 30% of
hereditary BrCa is explained by intermediate and high-risk inherited variants, like BRCA1 and BRCA2. Key
factors contributing to the discovery of BRCA1 were dense familial clustering, early age of onset, and
coaggregation with ovarian cancer (7-9). Unique multi-cancer configurations for carriers of BRCA1
mutations (breast, ovarian, Fanconi anemia, prostate, pancreatic, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers)
and BRCA2 mutations (breast, male breast, prostate, pancreatic cancers and Fanconi anemia) are now
accepted (Figure 1). These multi-cancer configurations were identified after discovery of BRCA1/2
mutations in BrCa. However, data driven methods make it possible to uncover multi-cancer
configurations before gene discovery. These configurations could immediately permit better definitions
of cancer phenotypes (subtypes or multi-cancer) for gene discovery and environmental risk factor
studies.
Classical methods for assessing familial coaggregation are to determine the relative risk of
cancer in first-degree (FDR), second-degree (SDR), and third-degree (TDR) relatives of individuals with
the cancer of interest (pivot-individual). Cancer in the pivot-individual and cancer assessed in the

relatives can be equivalent or different(10, 11). However, these methods use an iterative pairwise
approach (pivot cancer and relative cancer) and are unable to simultaneously exploit data for multiple
cancer types so power to identify novel patterns of multi-cancer clustering is limited. Other domains
have developed innovative computational techniques to discover patterns across expansive amounts of
data in large databases. Application of such “big-data” techniques to linked genealogical and cancer
databases can potentially identify new multi-cancer configurations and improve understanding of
familial cancer risk, tumor spectrum and phenotypic heterogeneity.
This study takes advantage of a unique population-level data resource, the Utah Population
Database (UPDB), containing vast genealogy and statewide cancer data. This study focuses on the
discovery of novel familial multi-cancer configurations for BCa.
Methods
Study design and data
We utilized the genealogical, demographic, and health data from the UPDB. The UPDB supports
hundreds of biodemographic, epidemiologic, and genetic studies primarily due to its comprehensive
population coverage, pedigree complexity, and linkages across data sources (12, 13).
Cancer-specific data for individuals with urothelial BCa and their relatives was obtained from the
Utah Cancer Registry (UCR), an original member of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
program. We identified 6,752 individuals born 1900- 1990 with urothelial BCa and family history
information (defined as at least ten known relatives) as pivots. Families were only represented once in
the analysis. When multiple siblings (n ≥ 2) had BCa (nsibsets = 104), one sibling was randomly selected
as a pivot. Our final sample included 6,416 three-generation families.

Sixteen cancer-types previously shown to be associated with BCa (thyroid, leukemia, pancreas,
brain/CNS, lung, stomach, liver, larynx, melanoma, prostate, breast, ovarian, kidney, myeloma, small
intestine, and ocular) (1, 14) , plus BCa (17 cancers total) were considered simultaneously.
Statistical Analysis
We constructed a 6,416 x 17 matrix and used k-medoids clustering(15) to measure similarities
between the cancer enrichment profiles of families. Each resulting cluster was a BCa familial multicancer configuration (FMC).
Familial Enrichment
The following histologies were not included (8000, 8001, 8010, 8041, 8120, 8122, 8130, 8140,
8211, 8249, and 8255) (1). Enrichment was measured as a binary variable, (1= Yes, statistically higher
level of cancer than the general population; 0=No). We annotated each of the 6,416 families as
enriched or not enriched for the 17 cancers considered. Familial enrichment was estimated by
comparing the observed rate of each cancer type to published rates of cancer incidence in the Utah
population assuming a Poisson distribution (16). Families were considered enriched for a certain cancer
type if the rate of cancer cases in the family were significantly higher than expected (α≤ 0.05) and
flagged accordingly. Sensitivity analyses using a hypergeometric distribution found that the enrichment
categorization was equivalent to the categorization using the Poisson distribution.
Distance Measure and Selection of k
Due to dichotomous values value for enrichment, we used the Hamming distance(17) as our
distance metric. This metric is commonly used in natural language processing and information theory
for quantifying the similarity/dissimilarity for discrete values. This distance measure has also been used
for clustering SNP-sets (18, 19). K was selected by running an iterative set of models from k=2 to k=20

and using silhouette plots to determine the appropriate k (20). In addition to using silhouette plots, we
quantified risk of BCa mortality, familial risk of cancer, sex-specific risk of cancer, and enrichment of
known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers within each cluster using traditional methods.
Assessment of families after cluster identification
Cox models were used to identify differences in BCa-specific mortality of BCa pivots by FMC
cluster. Cause of death was obtained from state-wide death certificate records. Descriptive statistics
were generated for overall survival and BCa survival. We excluded 134 pivots for inadequate follow-up
information. Age and sex matched controls were used. Duration was measured as time to death or last
known date residing in Utah. Individuals who died from non-BCa causes were considered censored at
time of death in the BCa-specific survival analyses. We tested for differences in five-year and overall
survival between FMCs as well as sex-differences in survival.
To quantify risk in relative types and spouses in each FMC, a case-control design was used.
Cancer-free population controls were selected randomly, without replacement, from the UPDB and
matched 5:1 to BCa pivots by sex and birth year. Individuals previously excluded due to belonging to a
sibset with multiple BCa cases were included in this analysis (NBCa=6,752; NControls=33,752). Relatives
of BCa pivots and controls were identified. Relatives with unknown sex were removed (n=35). The casecontrol analysis included about 2 million relatives (RBCa=345,921; RControls=1,620,791). Spouses
(STotal= 32,173; SBCa=5,948; SControls=26,225) were considered a proxy for later life environmental
exposures (smoking, etc.). For each FMC, familial risks were estimated using Cox regression for cancer
in relatives of BCa pivots compared to the relatives of controls. Hazard risk ratios (HRR) were estimated
for FDRs, SDRs, and first cousins together and separately. We tested for sex-specific risks within the
FMC clusters via interaction term. All tests were two-sided and statistical significance was considered at
p<0.05.

The Utah Cancer Control Program (UCCP) aims to assess the burden of hereditary cancers at the
population level by linking the UPDB to BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing data from medical records, the
Utah Cancer Registry, and familial cancer registry data for state-wide surveillance (IRB_00079328). This
information was linked to individuals and family members in our BCa analytic files and allowed us to test
for the enrichment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 families within clusters. Families were labeled BRCA1 or BRCA2
positive if at least one family member tested positive for a mutation and BRCA negative if all family
members tested negative for BRCA1/2. We then tested for a higher proportion of BRCA1, BRCA2, or
BRCA negative families per cluster relative to the proportion of BRCA1, BRCA2, or BRCA negative families
in the population controls using logistic regression. We consider these results to be descriptive due to
selection into the testing pool. In lieu of reporting odds ratio estimates, we report p-values (full results
available upon request). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Utah (IRB_00088870).
Results
We identified 6,752 BCa pivots, 345,921 relatives and 5,948 spouses (Table 1). The number of
family members ranged from 10 to 334. Median age at diagnosis of BCa pivots ranged from 66.9 to 72.7
years and 5-year BCa-specific mortality ranged from 7.98% to 11.82%. We found no statistically
significant between-cluster or sex-specific differences in mortality (Table 2).
Familial multi-cancer configurations
We found 12 distinct FMCs (FMC1-12) using k-medioid clustering; each exhibited different
patterns of cancer aggregation (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). Four of the FMCs represented
families enriched for BCa and other cancers (FMC4, FMC1, FMC8, and FMC6; nfamilies=1868, 28.1%).
These four clusters were the focus of our subsequent analyses. The other eight FMCs were not enriched
for BCa and not considered ‘familial BCa clusters’. Seven were enriched only for other cancers, which

could represent shared genetic and environment risks. One (FMC3, n=1758; 26.4%) indicated no familial
enrichment of cancer and was considered representative of sporadic BCa. Further characterization of
the non-familial and sporadic BCa clusters is found in the Supplementary Material.
The proportion of BCa families captured by the four familial BCa FMCs were 8.5%, 7.9%, 4.3%,
and 7.1% for FMC4, FMC1, FMC8, and FMC6, respectively. Figure 3a shows the heat-plot for these FMCs,
indicating their different patterns of enrichment. Enriched families are light blue (a statistically higher
rate than the population). Of the 17 cancer types studied, breast, melanoma, and prostate were most
commonly enriched in the familial BCa clusters. Stomach, liver, larynx, small intestine, and ocular
cancers were less commonly enriched.
We display a multiphenogram for each FMC in Figure 3b. We defined an FMC as “strongly
enriched” if at least 25% of families in the FMC was enriched. FMC4 was strongly enriched for BCa,
breast, melanoma, prostate, lung and leukemia (Figure 3). Families in FMC1 were strongly enriched for
BCa, pancreas, lung, leukemia, and breast cancer. Families in FMC8 were strongly enriched for BCa,
prostate and kidney cancer. Families in FMC6 were strongly enriched for BCa and melanoma.
Relative-Specific Risks in Familial BCa FMCs
Supplementary Tables 1 - 7 and Supplementary Figure 2 show HRRs by sex and relative type for
each cancer within familial BCa FMCs across all families in the FMC compared to control families. This
analysis quantified familial risk and provided separate HRRs for relative types and sex. Consistent with
our designation of ‘familial BCa’ FMC clusters, relatives in FMC4, FMC1, FMC8, and FMC6 had more than
twice the risk of BCa than relatives of controls and FMC6 had the highest risk (HRRFMC6=4.02,
p<0.0001).
The FMC4 multiphenogram indicates aggregation with BCa, melanoma, breast, prostate,
leukemia and lung cancer (Figure 3B). Relatives of BCa pivots in FMC4 have more than twice the risk of

BCa compared to relatives of controls (HRR=2.49, p<0.0001). FMC4 is also characterized by an increased
risk of melanoma (HRR=2.14, p<0.0001), breast (HRR=1.12, p=0.0002), prostate (HRR=1.10, p=0.0001).
While more than 25% of families are enriched for leukemia and lung cancer, risk for the whole cluster
does not reach statistical significance when controlling for birth year and sex (HRRluekemia=1.13,
p=0.07; HRRlung= 1.02, p=0.75).
The FMC1 multiphenogram indicates aggregation with BCa, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung
cancer and leukemia (Figure 3B). Relatives of BCa pivots in FMC1 had more than twice the risk of BCa
than relatives of controls (HRR=2.49, p<0.0001). FDR, SDR, and first cousins were at increased risk for
breast cancer (overall HRR=1.44, p<0.0001). FDR were at increased risk for prostate (HRR=1.22,
p=0.007). Lung cancer was nominally increased in relatives overall (HRR=1.13, p=0.01). While more than
25% of families were enriched for pancreatic cancer and leukemia, risk for the entire FMC did not reach
statistical significance when controlling for birth year and sex (HRRpancreas=1.07, p=0.39;
HRRleukemia=1.36, p=0.54). Additionally, FDR and SDR in this FMC were at increased risk for thyroid
cancer (HRRFDR=1.74, HRRSDR=1.65).
The FMC8 multiphenogram indicates strong aggregation for BCa, prostate, and kidney cancers
(Figure 3B). Relatives of BCa pivots were found to be nearly three-times more likely to be diagnosed
with BCa than relatives of controls (HRR=2.71, p<0.0001), and this risk remained reasonably consistent
by relative type (HRRFDR=2.74, p<0.0001; HRRSDR=3.43, p<0.0001; HRRFC=2.43, p<0.0001). Relatives
had increased risk of prostate cancer (HRR=1.29, p<0.0001) and kidney cancer (HRR=1.40, p=0.001). We
also found nominal evidence for increased risk of lung cancer (HRR=1.16, p=0.04) and myeloma
(HRR=1.35, p=0.02).

The FMC6 multiphenogram indicates strong aggregation with BCa and melanoma (Figure 3B).
Consistent with those findings, we found significant increased risk for BCa and melanoma
(HRRBCa=2.71, p<0.0001; HRRmelanoma=1.21, p=0.002).
Adult Environmental Exposure
Increased risk of cancer in spouses suggests adulthood exposure to an environmental toxin that
may explain some patterns of clustering within an FMC. Spouses of BCa cases in FMC4 had increased risk
of prostate (HRR=1.65, p=0.03) and kidney (HRR=2.33, p=0.04) cancers. Spouses of BCa pivots in FMC6
were at increased risk of kidney (HRR=2.76, p=0.03) and larynx (HR=11.4, p=0.0014) cancers. There was
no difference in risk for spouses of BCa cases in FMC1 or FMC8. Adult environmental exposures may not
play a major role in cancer risk for these clusters.
Sex-Specific BCa Risk
Sex-specific results can be found in Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.
Significant difference in sex-specific BCa risk were observed for relatives in FMC4 and FMC6. In FMC4
the female risk of BCa was significantly greater (HRMaleFMC4=2.31 and HRFemaleFMC4=3.15, sexdifference p=0.0002). In FMC6, while risk for BCa is high in both sexes compared to controls, the
female-specific risk was significantly lower (HRMaleFMC6=4.22 and HRFemaleFMC6=3.35, sexdifference p=0.035). In addition, the risk of melanoma, lung, and myeloma varied by sex in FMC6, with
females having a higher risk for melanoma and lower risk of lung and myeloma compared to males in
these families. In FMC1, female relatives were found at increased risk for brain/CNS cancers
(HRRFMC1=1.22, p=0.07; sex-difference p=0.005), while male relatives are at decreased risk for
brain/CNS cancers (HRRFMC1=0.71, p=0.03).
Reduced Cancer Risk

While the initial family-based clustering algorithm did not consider decreased cancer risk, when
assessing relative-specific risks we identified patterns of reduced risk by cancer type within each FMCs
(Supplementary Table 1). There is a lower risk for pancreatic cancer (HRR=0.77, p=0.003) in FMC4,
melanoma (HRR=0.20, p<0.0001) in FMC1, breast cancer (HRR=0.29, p<0.0001) and melanoma
(HRR=0.19, p<0.0001) in FMC8, and breast (HRR=0.36, p<0.0001) and prostate cancer (HRR=0.27,
p<0.0001) in FMC6.
BRCA Families
BRCA1/2 genetic test results were available for 518 individuals from 257 families. Families were
classified as BRCA1 or BRCA2 families if at least one individual tested positive for the mutation and BRCA
negative if no individuals in the family tested positive for BRCA1/2. Two families had carriers of BRCA1
and BRCA2 and were placed in both categories (NBRCA1=80, NBRCA2=62, NNeg=117). We found
significant enrichment of BRCA1 families in one of the familial BCa clusters (FMC4 p<0.001) and two
non-familial clusters (FMC2 p=0.008 and FMC12 p=0.02). FMC1 was enriched with BRCA2 families
(p=0.03). Two families were sigificantly enriched for BRCA1/2 negative families, indicaticating that they
have familial risk of cancer that qualifies them for testing, but is not related to the BRCA1/2 genes
(FMC7 p=0.03 and FMC12 p=0.007).
Discussion
We have described familial multi-cancer configurations (FMC), illustrating 12 patterns of multicancer clustering surrounding BCa patients. Four FMCs exhibited strong familial risk of BCa, as well as
co-aggregation with other cancer types. Eight FMCs did not have increased risk of BCa (non-familial
BCa). The largest of these did not show increased risk to any cancer and was considered representative
of sporadic BCa. We also identified risk variation by sex and relation type across FMCs. Patterns of
multi-cancer risk in spouses of BCa cases suggests some FMCs may have environmental risk factors. The

four different FMC clusters identified for BCa illustrate the potential of our network-inspired approach
to simultaneously assess multiple cancer risks, shifting focus away from a unidimensional definition of
family history to a more comprehensive view of family history and risk prevention.
Enrichment of BRCA1 families in FMC4 and BRCA2 families in FMC1 provides support for the utility of a
multi-cancer configurations for identifying families genetically predisposed to cancer and the possible
pleiotropic effects of genetic mutations. BRCA1/2 genes function across multiple tissue types and
development of cancerous cells is not constrained to breast and ovarian tissue. BRCA1 and BRCA2
founder mutations have been associated with prostate and pancreatic cancer risk (21-23). There is an
increased risk of breast and prostate cancer in FMC4 and FMC1. FMC1 has an increased risk of
pancreatic cancer, which is consistent with reports that pancreatic cancer risk is higher for BRCA2
relative to BRCA1 mutation carriers(24). FMC4 has elevated risk of melanoma, which is consistent with
significantly elevated risk of melanoma in BRCA1 families (25).
The concept of phenomes, extending the phenotype to include multiple disease types to
characterize genotype-phenotype relationships, is not new. However, the phenome is usually referred
to as the set of all phenotypes within an individual. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of
‘phenome-wide association scans’ (PheWAS), using genetic data linked to medical records to identify
multiple phenotypes associated with a single genotype (26). Pan-cancer analyses are another familiar
concept. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) launched the Pan-cancer analysis project in 2012 with the
goal of combining molecular data across large numbers of tumor types to compare -omics data across
tumors, potentially allowing for the identification of thematic pathways (27). However, these are
independent individuals. Here we utilized family-based data to investigate familial patterns of pancancer clustering, a novel familial extension to pan-cancer studies.

Molecular diagnostics and cancer-specific subtypes are becoming an essential component of
clinical decision making, however current approaches are typically organ-specific or do not include
context for understanding the interplay between genes and environoment. The most recent BCa-specific
analysis of TCGA data found five distinct subtypes; 1) luminal-papillary, 2) luminal-infiltrated, 3) luminal,
4) basal-squamous, and 5) neuronal (28). Other studies have shown these subtypes closely align to
cancers in other organs. The PAM50 algorithm (originally developed for breast cancer) is used to classify
breast, prostate, bladder and lung cancer (29-32), evidence that molecular subtypes may share common
etiologies. Subtypes of BCa cancer have clinically meaningful differences (33), however what
predisposes an individual to a particular subtype is unknown. Understanding etiology of the disease has
clinical potential because it allows for increased screening in at-risk populations and may guide
treatment decisions at early stages of diagnosis. Combining familial multi-cancer phenotypes, as we
developed here, with tumor molecular data has potential for identification and characterization of BCa
subtypes that may share common etiological tumorigenic pathways.
Many genetic and environmental risk factors have been proposed in BCa risk, which could
manifest as different multi-cancer configurations across a spectrum of organs. FDRs likely share similar
environments throughout the life course and therefore familial aggregation of BCa cancer may not be
entirely genetic. For example, family members exposed to arsenic through common drinking wells
during childhood may have later life risk for bladder and other related cancers (34). Prostate and kidney
risk cancer increases with arsenic exposure (35, 36) and FMC8 had increased risk of both. Genetic
predispositions may also make individuals sensitive to environmental exposures. For example, arsenic
metabolism may vary between individuals and the rate of metabolism affects risk for adverse health
outcomes (37). Moreover, individuals with N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator and glutathione
S-transferase µ1 (GSTM1)-null genotypes may have increased risk for BCa when exposed to carcinogens
through smoking or occupational risk (38-40).

There are limitations with our method of familial multi-cancer clustering discovery. First, the
clustering method did not factor in ages of the pedigree members and therefore some families may
have younger members on average than others. However, our subsequent analyses (comparing familial
cancer risk to population controls) did control for age and sex, and hence we feel our results of distinct
multi-cancer configuriations is robust. Second, this method did not factor in age at diagnosis or
histopathological information. Future versions of this method would be strengthened by considering
those factors. Third, this method did not utilize all information in pedigree structure and future studies
should test methods that take advantage of that information. Despite these limitations, application of
this approach could provide important insight to numerous cancers and other age-related chronic
diseases.
Conclusions
This study identified four BCa FMCs with different patterns of BCa risk by age, sex, and relative

risk was for prostate, melanoma, and breast cancers.
