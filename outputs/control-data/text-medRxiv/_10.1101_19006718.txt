Abstract
Background
Family history (FHx) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for
cardiovascular heritability. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarizing >1 million variants for
coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events. However,
little is known about the influence of FHx or PRS on secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE) in
patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

Methods
We included 1,788 CEA patients from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted PRS for CAD
including 1.7 million variants was calculated (MetaGRS). The composite endpoint of sCVE
during three years follow-up included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and
cardiovascular death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS on sCVE and carotid plaque
composition.

Results
Positive FHx was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent of cardiovascular
risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.07-1.82, p=0.013). Patients in the highest
MetaGRS quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest of the cohort
independent of cardiovascular risk factors including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79,
p=0.043), and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted OR 1.59, 95%CI, 1.112.29, p=0.013) and more macrophages (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.12-1.99, p=0.006).

Conclusion
In CEA patients, both positive FHx and higher MetaGRS were independently associated with
increased risk of sCVE. Moreover, higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque
characteristics. Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms and focus on the added
value of PRS and FHx in individual risk prediction for sCVE.

Introduction
Family history of cardiovascular disease (FHx) is a major risk factor for primary cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and serves as a surrogate for genetic predisposition.(1, 2) Risk prediction for
secondary cardiovascular events remains challenging as traditional risk factors have limited
discriminative performance.(3) The main underlying mechanism of CVD is atherosclerosis, and
atherosclerotic plaque composition, exemplified by intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH), was shown
to be associated to adverse secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE).(4) Yet, the relevance of
FHx for secondary outcome of cardiovascular events is still unclear.(5–9)

Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of
common genetic variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) robustly associated with
coronary artery disease (CAD)(10–14) and ischemic stroke(15–17) predisposition, albeit with
small individual effects. Exact pathobiological mechanisms leading to cardiovascular symptoms
are still poorly understood, but CAD- and ischemic stroke genetic variants were previously
associated to atherosclerotic plaque composition.(18)

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarize the small individual genetic effects into a
quantitative measure of genetic disease susceptibility. Recent studies showed that PRS were
strongly correlated with prevalent and incident CAD independent of traditional risk factors
including family history in the UK Biobank population.(19, 20) For example, individuals with
higher scores of the MetaGRS (a PRS for CAD including 1.7 million SNPs) were at 1.7-4.2 fold
higher risk for a first coronary event compared to individuals with lower MetaGRS scores. In

addition, a very recent study in a French-Canadian population with established CAD showed that
MetaGRS was also associated with increased risk of recurrent CAD events.(21)

As atherosclerosis is known for its complex nature with genetic overlap in different
diseases such as stroke, CAD, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and peripheral artery disease
(PAD)(22), we aimed to investigate the association between MetaGRS and long-term secondary
cardiovascular events in a different cohort of severe atherosclerotic patients with carotid artery
stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Given that FHx is used in clinical practice as a
derivative of genetic background, we also examined the association between FHx and secondary
cardiovascular

events.

Moreover,

to

possible

underlying

pathophysiological

mechanisms, we studied the impact of MetaGRS and FHx on carotid histological plaque
characteristics.

Methods
Athero-Express Biobank
All patients in this study were included in the Athero-Express Biobank, a prospective cohort
study that included consecutive patients with severe carotid artery stenosis undergoing CEA in
two large tertiary referral hospitals in The Netherlands, the University Medical Centre Utrecht
(inclusion is ongoing) and the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein (inclusion until 2014).(23) The
study design has been published before.(23) In short, patient characteristics, such as
demographics, cardiovascular risk factors including medical history, medication use, and FHx
for cardiovascular disease, were obtained through standardized questionnaires and checked in
electronic health records. Preoperative blood samples were drawn. The atherosclerotic plaque
obtained during surgery was collected and immunohistochemically analysed for plaque
characteristics. Patients were followed up for three years after surgery for the occurrence of
secondary cardiovascular events through standardized questionnaires and by checking electronic
health records. General practitioners were consulted in case of no response to questionnaires or
in order to obtain further information regarding reported cardiovascular events. Patients operated
for restenosis (6% of 2,044 eligible patients for this study) were excluded because these differ in
future cardiovascular event risk.(24) Thus for the current study, a total of 1,788 patients operated
from March 2002 until July 2016 had available 3-year follow-up data and FHx data, and were
included for analysis. Of these, 1,551/1,788 (87%) patients had available histological carotid
plaque data. A total of 1,319/1,788 (74%) patients had available genotype data of whom 1,301
(98%) also had histological carotid plaque data. This study was performed according to the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee of both hospitals.
Patients provided written informed consent before study participation.

Definitions
A positive FHx was defined as having a first-degree relative (either a parent or sibling) with
onset of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery stenosis, stroke,
AAA, or cardiovascular death including sudden death) before the age of 60 years. The primary
outcome of this study was defined as a composite secondary cardiovascular event (sCVE) within
three years of follow-up including fatal or non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, ruptured AAA,
fatal cardiac failure, coronary or peripheral interventions (either percutaneous or bypass surgery),
leg amputation due to cardiovascular causes and cardiovascular death. Secondary outcomes were
histological atherosclerotic carotid plaque characteristics.

Genotyping
Methods for genotyping, quality control and imputation in the Athero-Express biobank have
been published elsewhere (25, 26). Briefly, DNA was extracted from EDTA whole blood
samples or if not present from atherosclerotic plaque tissue according to validated protocols.
Genotyping was performed with two commercially available chips: the first batch by Affymetrix
Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (previously used in the Athero-Express Genomics Study 1
(AEGS1), covering samples obtained in 2002-2007) and the second batch by Affymetrix Axiom
GW CEU 1 array (previously used in Athero-Express Genomics Study 2 (AEGS2), covering
samples obtained in 2002-2013). Procedures for data quality control and data cleaning were in
accordance with global standards.(27) After genotype calling according to Affymetrix’
specification, data was filtered on 1) individual call rate > 97%, 2) genotype call rate > 97%, 3)
minor allele frequencies (MAF) > 3%, 4) average heterozygosity rate ± 3.0 standard deviations,

5) relatedness (pi-hat > 0.20), 6) Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE p < 1.0×10−6), and 7)
population stratification (based on HapMap 2, release 22, b36) by excluding samples deviating
more than 6 standard deviations from the average in 5 iterations during principal component
analysis and by visual inspection.(25) After pre-phasing using SHAPEIT2 v2.644, a combined
dataset of 1000 Genome (phase 3, version 5) and The Genome of the Netherlands Project release
5 was used as a reference for imputation with IMPUTE2 v2.3.0.(28)

Polygenic risk score (MetaGRS)
To estimate the polygenic cardiovascular disease susceptibility for included patients in our
cohort, we used the previously published polygenic risk score for CAD (MetaGRS).(19) Its
construction was described elsewhere.(19) Briefly, the MetaGRS comprises 1.7 million genetic
variants associated with CAD and was constructed through meta-analysis of three genomic risk
scores: GRS46K (comprising 46,000 cardiometabolic genetic variants), FDR202 (including 202
genetic variants associated with CAD at false discovery rate p<0.05 in the recent GWAS
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D),

and

risk of prevalent and incident CAD in the UK Biobank.(19) We calculated the MetaGRS for each
included patient in this study and standardized it to mean-zero and unit-variance for each
genotyping batch separately, i.e. AEGS1 and AEGS2, respectively.

Sample handling
After CEA, the atherosclerotic plaque was directly processed in the laboratory following
standardized protocols.(4, 23, 29, 30) The plaque was cut in cross-sectional segments of 5mm.

The segment with largest plaque burden was chosen as the culprit lesion and
immunohistochemically analysed for macrophages, smooth muscle cells (SMC), lipid core,
calcification, collagen, intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH) and microvessel content. Extensive
description of the standardized protocol for atherosclerotic plaque processing and analysis of
plaque characteristics has been previously reported and is added to the Supplemental. (4, 23, 29,
30) To assess the overall vulnerability of the atherosclerotic plaque, a vulnerability score was
created ranging from 0-5 with 1 point for plaque characteristics that are considered hallmarks of
a vulnerable plaque (moderate/heavy macrophages, no/minor collagen, no/minor SMC, lipid
core>10% and presence of IPH), based on a previous publication.(31)

Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared between patient groups (FHx and MetaGRS) by chisquare test for categorical variables and Student’s t-test for continuous variables (lipid levels
were log-transformed). We analysed the association between FHx and MetaGRS and sCVE by
Cox-proportional hazard regression models and the associations with plaque characteristics
through logistic or linear regression models. To fully unravel the genetic association, the
association of MetaGRS with sCVE and plaque characteristics was analysed in three ways: (1)
MetaGRS as a continuous quantification of genetic CAD susceptibility (2) patients in the top
20% of the MetaGRS distribution compared to the remaining 80%, and (3) patients in the top
20% of the MetaGRS distribution compared to those in the bottom 20% of the distribution.
Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to graphically illustrate univariate associations.
Confounders for multivariable analyses were selected based on literature(19, 31, 32) (for sCVE
these were age, sex, diabetes, BMI, smoking and hypercholesterolemia and for plaque

characteristics these were age, sex, surgery year and type of cerebrovascular symptoms).
Additional confounders were added when showing an association of p<0.20 with the determinant
(FHx or MetaGRS) and outcome of interest (sCVE or plaque characteristics). For MetaGRS
models genotype array and principal components 1-4 were also added. Full model description is
displayed in the Supplemental Tables S1 and S2. Because a previous study in our biobank
showed that IPH is associated with sCVE(4), IPH was added to multivariable models of FHx,
MetaGRS and sCVE to explore whether IPH could be one possible underlying mechanism. Sexstratified analyses were performed to unravel sex-dependent differences in associations. Values
with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed in IBM SPSS
Statistics version 25.0.

Results
Patient selection from the Athero-Express Biobank and characteristics of the study population
are displayed in Figure 1 and Table 1. Patients had a mean age 69 years and 70% were men. The
cohort represented a typically severe atherosclerotic cohort with high prevalence of traditional
risk factors and atherosclerotic manifestations in other vascular beds (coronary or peripheral
arteries, respectively 30% and 20%). Baseline characteristics were similar between the total
cohort with FHx data and the sub-cohort with genotyped data (Table 1).

Patients with positive FHx have a higher risk of sCVE
Patients with a positive FHx (744/1,788, 41.6%) were younger and had on average more
cardiovascular risk factors (Table 1). During a median follow-up of 2.9 years, 418 patients
(23.4%) reached the composite endpoint of sCVE (Figure 2A) of whom 105 (5.9%) had stroke or
fatal stroke, 119 (6.7%) had MI or fatal MI, 29 (1.6%) had cardiovascular death due to other
causes (fatal cardiac failure, AAA rupture or sudden death) and 165 (9.2%) had a peripheral
intervention or leg amputation.
Patients with positive FHx had an increased risk of sCVE compared to those without (absolute 3year risks of 26.5% versus 21.2% respectively, hazard ratio (HR) 1.292, 95% confidence interval
(CI), 1.066-1.566, p=0.009 (Figure 2A, Figure 3; Supplemental Table S3). This association
remained significant after correction for confounders with adjusted HR 1.287, 95%CI 1.0331.604, p=0.024 (Figure 3; Supplemental Table S3) and was independent of genetic predisposition
as measured by MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.397, 95%CI 1.074-1.819, p=0.013, Figure 3;
Supplemental Table S3). Sex-stratified analyses confirmed results in men (with adjusted HR
after correction for confounders of 1.380, 95%CI 1.068-1.783, p=0.014; adjusted HR after

correction for confounders including MetaGRS was 1.513, 95%CI 1.115-2.052, p=0.008).
However, in women the univariate association between FHx and sCVE was not significant
(unadjusted HR 1.187, 95%CI 0.822-1.171, p=0.360) but multivariable analyses could not be
performed because of limited power (Supplemental Table S3).

Patients with higher MetaGRS have a higher risk of sCVE
The MetaGRS, standardized to mean-zero and unit-variance, approximated a normal distribution
in the study population (Supplemental Figure S1). Patients in the top 20% of MetaGRS were
relatively more often females, younger of age and had less often diabetes compared to the
remaining 80% of the cohort (Table 1). Differences in baseline characteristics between high
(highest quintile of MetaGRS) and low genetic risk patients (lowest quintile of MetGRS) can be
found in the supplemental (Table S4). In the 3-year follow-up, a total of 326/1319 (24.7%)
patients reached the composite endpoint of sCVE of whom 96 (7.3%) had stroke or fatal stroke,
85 (6.4%) had MI or fatal MI, 21 (1.6%) died of other cardiovascular causes (fatal cardiac
failure, AAA rupture or sudden death) and 124 (9.4%) had a peripheral intervention or leg
amputation.
Patients in the top 20% of MetaGRS had 1.4 fold increased risk of developing sCVE within the
three years of follow-up when compared to the remaining 80% of the cohort (Figure 2B, absolute
3-year risks of 29.5% versus 23.5% respectively, HR 1.353, 95%CI 1.047-1.749, p=0.021). After
adjustment for possible confounders including FHx this association remained statistically
significant (HR for top 20% 1.345, 95%CI 1.009-1.792, p=0.043). We found similar results
when we compared patients in top 20% to the bottom 20% of MetaGRS (in univariate analysis
with HR 1.539, 95%CI,1.086-2.181, p=0.015 (Figure 2C) and for multivariable analysis adjusted

HR including FHx 1.583, 95%CI, 1.066-2.351, p=0.023), and when analysing MetaGRS as a
continuous quantity (adjusted for confounders with HR 1.150 per one SD increase in MetaGRS,
95%CI 1.022-1.293, p=0.021, adjusted HR including FHx 1.112 per one SD increase in
MetaGRS, 95% CI, 0.983-1.259, p=0.091). Results are illustrated in Figures 2B+C and 3, and
displayed in Supplemental Table S3. Confounders added to multivariable models are displayed
in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2.
Similar results were found in men (adjusted for confounders including FHx showed a HR 1.219
per one SD increase in MetaGRS, 95%CI 1.056-1.408, p=0.006, Supplemental Table S3). In
women univariate analyses showed no significant associations between MetaGRS and sCVE
(HR 0.916 per one SD increase in MetaGRS, 95% CI 0.743-1.129, p=0.413), yet multivariable
analysis was not possible due to lack of power (Supplemental Table S3).

MetaGRS is associated with vulnerable carotid plaque characteristics
To unravel possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the associations between
MetaGRS, FHx and CVD, we explored the impact of FHx and the MetaGRS on atherosclerotic
plaque characteristics. We found no associations between histological plaque characteristics and
FHx in the total cohort or in women although not all multivariable analyses could be performed
(Supplemental Table S7 and S8). However carotid plaques from men with a positive FHx
contained less collagen and less SMC content compared to men with negative FHx
(Supplemental table S8). MetaGRS was associated with significantly higher overall plaque
vulnerability score (regression coefficient β of 0.070 per SD increase in MetaGRS, 95%CI,
0.003-0.137, p=0.040). To determine the plaque characteristics on which this association was
based, plaque characteristics were analysed separately. High genetic risk patients (in top 20% of

MetaGRS) more frequently had a lipid core>10% of total plaque area (adjusted odds ratio (OR),
1.591, 95% CI 1.105-2.291, p=0.013) and more macrophage infiltration (adjusted OR 1.490,
95% CI 1.118-1.986, p=0.006) compared to patients with MetaGRS in the remaining 80% (Table
2). For lipid core, we found the same association when comparing the top 20% with the bottom
20% of the MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.887, 95% CI, 1.188-2.997, p=0.007, Supplemental Table
S5). Analyses of MetaGRS as a continuous quantity confirmed the association with lipid
core>10% (adjusted OR 1.171 per SD increase in MetaGRS, 95% CI 1.026-1.337, p=0.019,
Table 3). Sex-stratified analyses revealed a significant association of MetaGRS with
macrophages in women (adjusted OR per SD increase in MetaGRS 1.238, 95%CI, 1.007-1.521,
p=0.043) whereas a significant association of MetaGRS with IPH was found in men (adjusted
OR per SD increase 1.220, 95%CI 1.050-1.418, p=0.010 Supplemental Table S6).
Because IPH has been associated with increased risk of sCVE(4), we added IPH to the
multivariable models of FHx, MetaGRS and sCVE to unravel whether the association between
FHx, MetaGRS and sCVE could be explained by IPH. We found that all associations of FHx and
MetaGRS were independent of IPH given that adding IPH to multivariable models of sCVE did
not alter the effect sizes (Supplemental Table S3).

Discussion
We validated the polygenic risk score for CAD (MetaGRS) for sCVE in a severe atherosclerotic
cohort of carotid artery stenosis patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. We report four key
findings. First, FHx was independently associated with an increased risk of sCVE. Second,
higher MetaGRS score was independently associated with an increased risk of sCVE. Third, the
association of MetaGRS with sCVE was independent of FHx and the association of FHx with
sCVE was independent of MetaGRS. Fourth, high MetaGRS was associated with more
vulnerable carotid atherosclerotic plaque characteristics suggesting possible underlying
pathobiological mechanisms through which genetic variants could affect CVD.

Although positive FHx is a well-known risk factor for primary CVE(1, 2), previous
studies assessing FHx and secondary outcome are inconsistent.(5, 7–9, 33) In patients with firstMI(7, 8, 33), studies have reported a protective effect of FHx on all-cause mortality, whereas
others showed an increased risk of CVE.(5, 9) One can assume that patients with positive FHx
are identified earlier as at-risk individuals through screening programs resulting in more
intensive surveillance and preventive strategies leading to the benefit in overall survival.(7)
Indeed, in our cohort patients with positive FHx were also younger at timing of CEA. Of note, it
is known that the sensitivity of self-reported FHx can be low (50%-70%) and might therefore be
an unreliable estimate.(34)

Our results are an independent validation of and consistent with a recent French Canadian
study that revealed the association of MetaGRS in patients with recurrent CAD.(21) We now
confirm this association in a different patient population with high prevalence of other CVD

comorbidities either in coronary or peripheral vascular beds having severe carotid artery stenosis
requiring intervention. Our results therefore underscore the concept of atherosclerosis as a
complex and systemic disease underlying CVD. We extend the results from the French Canadian
study as we corrected for FHx and possible confounding factors such as baseline medication,
medical history and cardiovascular risk factors, highlighting the independent association of
MetaGRS with sCVE. Furthermore, we provide mechanistic insights by showing associations of
MetaGRS with vulnerable plaque characteristics (lipid core and macrophages content) indicative
of an unstable overall plaque morphology. Previous studies in CAD patients assessing other
CAD-GRS and sCVE were inconsistent, but these GRSs incorporated a limited number of SNPs
(varying from 19 to 47 SNPs).(35–40) The current MetaGRS is the result of a meta-analysis and
therefore captures information from the full genome for CAD, possibly explaining the clear
reproducibility of this MetaGRS in two CAD cohorts and our CEA cohort.(19)

The independent association of FHx and PRS has been reported frequently for primary
CAD events(19, 20, 41), however only one study showed this for sCVE.(40) We confirm the
independent association of MetaGRS with sCVE from FHx. Indeed, we also found that positive
FHx was associated with increased risk of sCVE independent of genetic risk (MetaGRS). Several
reasons could be hypothesized for the non-overlapping associations of FHx and MetaGRS with
CVE. MetaGRS includes common genetic variants associated to an increased risk for CAD in
the general population, whilst CVD in families may arise in part from more rare genetic
mutational events, and thus a positive FHx captures individual yet family specific rare variation.
Another explanation could be that FHx reflects not only genetic factors but also non-genetic
factors. Although we corrected for traditional risk factors, other environmental factors that were

not taken into account such as social economic status or nutrition patterns could still be
attributable to the risk of secondary events.

Exactly how genetic variants affect CVD is currently unknown. CAD-variants have been
linked to pathways involved in atherosclerosis (e.g. lipid metabolism, inflammation, blood
pressure and vascular remodelling), but most CAD-variants are situated outside protein-coding
regions with unknown functions, making them hard to map to pathophysiological
mechanisms.(13, 42) We found that MetaGRS was associated with a more rupture-prone
atherosclerotic plaque displayed by a higher plaque vulnerability score caused by more fat, IPH
(in men) and macrophages (predominantly in women). Moreover, carotid plaques from men with
positive FHx were associated with less SMC and less collagen, whereas the association in
women remains unclear. Similarly, a previous AE study showed that a CAD-PRS was correlated
with more fat, whereas a large-artery stroke-PRS was correlated with more IPH and SMC.(18)
Our results support the view that genetic variants could mediate their effect on CVD by
influencing atherosclerotic plaque composition and morphology. Interestingly, IPH has been
associated with sCVE in men independent of other clinical risk factors in our biobank (4, 43), yet
we found that the associations of MetaGRS, FHx and sCVE were independent of IPH. It
therefore remains unclear what the underlying mechanism is through which MetaGRS and FHx
exert their increased sCVE risk. Moreover, it is shown that only small proportions (<8%) of the
effect of genetic risk as well as of FHx for CAD were mediated through known metabolic
pathways such as blood lipids and hypertension, whereas the majority (>80%) was not.(44)
Albeit, these findings were based on a GRS consisting of only 50-CAD-SNPs. Future studies
should explore exact pathophysiological mechanisms how genetic variants captured by the

MetaGRS influence plaque destabilization, primary and secondary CVE risk, for example
through deep-phenotyping of atherosclerotic plaque characteristics by quantitative computerized
analysis(45), mapping MetaGRS loci to specific CVE (MI, stroke or PAD), and further
investigating the potential sex-differences.

Although PRS could identify high-risk patients for CVE, one could conclude that due to
their unfavourable genetic risk the CVE risk is unchangeable. However, previous studies have
suggested that high genetic risk is modifiable by lifestyle interventions or medication, thus not
deterministic per se.(46) Among individuals with high genetic risk (top 20% of CAD-GRS),
those adhering to a healthy lifestyle had lower relative risk of a first-CAD event compared to
those with an unfavourable lifestyle. (46) Moreover, both in primary or secondary prevention
trials, patients with high genetic risk (those in top 20% of CAD-GRS) had a greater absolute and
relative risk reduction of (recurrent) MI or coronary death than those with lower genetic risk
despite equal LDL level reductions. (40, 47) In the current era of evolving new expensive drugs
(e.g. PCSK9-inhibitors or new anti-inflammatory drugs such as IL1b-blockers(48)) and the
increasing burden of CVD on the sustainability of the healthcare system, the cost-effectiveness
ratio becomes important. In the future, it may be useful to investigate whether the efficacy of
such medications varies across genetic risk categories for selecting those benefit most and
qualify for these add-on therapies.

Admittedly, our study has several limitations. First, although our results may suggest
interesting sex-differences as we only observed the independent association of MetaGRS and
FHx for sCVE in men, the association in women remains unclear because we were

underpowered for multivariable analysis. Second, we did not have data regarding medication use
during follow-up nor therapy compliance. These factors could have interfered with observed
sCVE rates. Second, owing to limited power we were unable to assess associations with separate
CVE or determine the predictive value of MetaGRS above clinical risk factors. Last, most
included patients are of European ancestries and generalizability to other ethnicities needs further
attention. Yet, the Athero-Express Biobank is unique in its scope and its major strengths are 1)
the unique population that is relatively unexplored in the field of FHx and PRS, 2) the
prospective study design with detailed data on patient characteristics (including FHx), and 3) the
extensive data on plaque composition and morphology that enable us to identify putative
pathological mechanisms.

In the future, PRS may be a useful tool for personalized risk prediction for primary or
secondary CVE. Adding MetaGRS to a model with traditional risk factors improved prediction
of first-CAD events, although model improvement was modest.(19) The clinical utility of PRS
for sCVE is still unknown because the incremental value of PRS above clinical factors still needs
to be established. One study suggested an additive predictive value of PRS above clinical factors
but did not include FHx (38), whereas other studies failed to demonstrate this.(35, 36, 39) The
power of these studies may have been limited due to limited number of CVE. Pooling data of
several cohorts including detailed data on preventive strategies and medications during follow-up
together with use of uniform outcome definitions for sCVE and uniform PRS composition could
help elucidate the clinical value of PRS, for example within international collaborations such as
the GENIUS-CHD Consortium.(49) Furthermore, possible sex-differences in the role of risk
prediction with PRS need to be further elucidated.

In conclusion, both higher MetaGRS and positive FHx were independently associated
with increased risk of sCVE in carotid artery stenosis patients undergoing CEA. Higher
MetaGRS was also associated with more vulnerable carotid plaque characteristics indicating
possible underlying mechanism how genetic variants influence CVD. PRS could identify highrisk individuals and may help selecting future study populations when investigating new
therapeutic CVD prevention strategies.

Table 1. Baseline characteristics.
Values are displayed as n (%), unless otherwise specified. Values indicated as bold* are statistically significant. Values below p<0.20 are
indicated by b. BMI, Body mass index; CAD, coronary artery disease; PAD, peripheral artery disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration
rate; TIA, transient ischemic attack; SD, standard deviation. When multiple cerebrovascular symptoms occurred in the six months prior to the
operation, the most serious symptom counts in the following order: stroke> TIA> ocular. Ocular symptoms include transient or permanent
retinal ischemia.
History of any stroke includes ipsilateral or contralateral stroke. Antiplatelet drug use includes the use of aspirin, dipyridamole or any ADPinhibitor. Lipid lowering drug use includes any lipid-lowering drug. Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension were defined as
diagnosed by a medical doctor or medication use for the specific comorbidity.

Table 2. Associations of carotid plaque characteristics from patients in top 20% of MetaGRS compared to the rest of the patients (80% of
MetaGRS).
Values are displayed as n/total (%), unless otherwise specified. Values indicated as bold* are statistically significant. OR, odds ratio; IPH, intraplaque
haemorrhage. Unadjusted OR indicates univariate analysis, adjusted OR indicates multivariable analysis. Multivariable analyses were corrected for age,
sex, surgery year, cerebrovascular symptoms and additional confounders showing p<0.20 association with MetaGRS and the plaque characteristics of
interest. Confounders included in various multivariable models can be found in Supplemental Table S2.

Table 3. Associations of MetaGRS (as continuous measure) and histological carotid plaque characteristics.

Values are displayed as n/total (%), unless otherwise specified. Values indicated as bold* are statistically significant.
MetaGRS was standardized to mean-zero and unit-variance. The odds ratio (OR) indicates OR per one SD increase in
MetaGRS. IPH, intraplaque haemorrhage. Unadjusted OR indicates univariate analysis, adjusted OR indicates
multivariable analysis. Multivariable analyses were corrected for age, sex, surgery year, cerebrovascular symptoms and
additional confounders showing p<0.20 association with MetaGRS and the plaque characteristics of interest.
Confounders included in various multivariable models can be found in Supplemental Table S2.
