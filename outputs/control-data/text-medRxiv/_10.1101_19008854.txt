Abstract

28

in mosquito exposure may partially explain this heterogeneity. However, exposure variability

29

has not been related to individual malaria outcomes.

30

Methods: We established a cohort of 38 households to explore the effect of household-level

31

mosquito exposure and individual insecticide treated net(ITN) use on relative risk(RR) of

32

diagnostically-confirmed malaria. We conducted monthly active surveillance (n=254; 2,624

33

person-months) and weekly mosquito collection in all households (2,092 household-days of

34

collection). We used molecular techniques to confirm human blood feeding and exposure to

35

infectious mosquitoes.

36

Results: Of 1,494 female anopheles (89.8% Anopheles gambiae s.l.). 88.3% were fed, 51.9% had

37

a human bloodmeal, and 9.2% were sporozoite-infected. 168 laboratory-confirmed malaria

38

episodes were reported (incidence rate 0.064 episodes per person-month at risk, 95%

39

confidence interval [CI]:0.055,0.074). Malaria risk was directly associated with exposure to

40

sporozoite-infected mosquitoes (RR=1.24, 95%CI:1.11,1.38). No direct effect was measured

41

between ITN use and malaria morbidity, however, ITN use did moderate the effect of mosquito

42

exposure on morbidity.

Background: Malaria morbidity is highly overdispersed in the population. Fine-scale differences

Conclusions: Malaria risk increases linearly with vector density and feeding success for persons

44

with low ITN use. In contrast, malaria risk among high ITN users is consistently low and

insensitive to variation in mosquito exposure.

Background

53
54

Cases of malaria are highly over-dispersed in human populations [1-4]: as little as 20% of

55

individuals experience 80% of the disease burden. The reason for this heterogeneity is

56

undoubtedly multifactorial, and even after adjusting for age and behavioral differences such as

57

ITN use, the imbalance remains [2-4]. Quantifying the heterogeneity attributable to variability in

58

entomological exposure requires fine-scale measurement of both mosquito populations and

59

malaria incidence at a household or individual level. This has rarely been done and instead human

60

cohort studies that incorporate exposure substitute either local infection prevalence in humans

61

as a proxy for exposure [3, 5] or extrapolate entomological indicators from sentinel villages or

62

households [4, 6-9]. Both approaches have limitations with regards to understanding the

63

relationship between exposure and disease risk owing to the fact that disease risk is

64

heterogeneous below the village level [10-13]. Such studies present inconsistent findings

65

regarding exposure and incidence. Although cross-sectional studies of vector biting

66

heterogeneity demonstrate significant over-dispersion in exposure to mosquito bites, this has

67

not been linked to subsequent infection or disease distribution [14].

68
69

Recent studies support the role of mosquito exposure heterogeneity in understanding evolving

70

malaria transmission dynamics, particularly in areas where endemicity is declining [14-18].

71

Mathematical models predict that exposure heterogeneity could reduce the effectiveness of

72

malaria control measures [19]. Linking individual mosquito exposure to morbidity outcomes

73

would enable more accurate estimation of the effects of vector control interventions at the

74

population level. However, cohort studies rarely measure fine-scale entomological exposure.

75
76

Here we offer a high-resolution picture of individual-level incidence of symptomatic disease

77

related to weekly household mosquito exposure metrics. We conducted a longitudinal study of

78

36 households in a moderate-transmission setting in Western Kenya in which we collected

79

weekly indoor-resting mosquitoes and passively-detected cases of malaria. We hypothesized that

80

excess variability in individual malaria risk would be at least partly explained by more precise

81

measures of mosquito exposure and that the relationship between disease and mosquito

82

exposure would increase with increasing specificity of exposure metric; from vector abundance,

83

to feeding success, to human biting rate, and finally vector infectiousness.

Methods

86

Study site

87

The study was carried out in Webuye East and West sub-counties located in western Kenya

88

approximately 400 kilometers northwest of Nairobi and 60 from the border with Uganda. The

89

sub-counties are rural and most families engage in small-scale farming and animal husbandry.

90

Very few families have access to amenities such as municipal water or electricity (<5%) and 53%

91

live below the poverty line [20]. There is one small town center along the main highway that

92

bisects the county. Malaria transmission is moderate and perennial with two seasonal peaks after

93

the long rains (May-June) and the short rains (Sept-October) although the timing and intensity of

94

the transmission peaks can vary from year to year. Vector control interventions are limited to ITN

96

measures such as sprays and coils is very uncommon.

97
98

Cohort

99

In July 2017, we established a cohort of 36 households in three villages that exhibited different

100

levels of malaria transmission based on previous work [21, 22]. We enrolled an index household

101

at random and then neighboring households radiating outwards until 12 households were

102

enrolled per village in a natural grouping. Two households were replaced with neighboring

103

households when the entire household migrated. All residents older than 12 months who

104

regularly slept in the household were enrolled. Children <12 months at baseline were enrolled

105

after they passed their first birthday. A household is defined as a group of people who share

106

cooking arrangements and may consist of one or more buildings grouped together in a

107

compound. Information about building construction, sleeping spaces, and ITN ownership was

108

collected at enrollment.

109
110

Cohort surveillance

111

At baseline, we registered all household members and collected dried blood spots from finger

112

pricks. Each month, we recorded data about bednet use in the preceding week and illness in the

113

preceding one month from all consenting household members over the age of 12 months. In

114

addition, all household members were invited to contact the study team whenever they

115

experienced a malaria-like illness. When contacted, study staff visited the home to test the

116

participant for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test (Carestart © Malaria HRP2 Pf from Accessbio).

117

If the participant had a negative test, they were referred with the test results to the nearest

118

health facility. If the test was a positive, the participant collected quality-assured ACT from the

119

local pharmacy at no charge to the participant.

120
121

Mosquito collection and identification

122

Once per week, on the same day each week, the study team visited each household early in the

123

morning to collect indoor resting mosquitoes via aspiration with Prokopacks (John W. Hock

124

Company). Participants were asked to leave windows and doors closed until the team arrived.

125

Mosquitoes were stored in collection cups in coolboxes with icepacks until they were transported

126

back to the laboratory. Mosquitoes were separated by genus and sex, and females were graded

127

according to their abdominal status. Female Anopheles were imaged under magnification for

128

post-hoc speciation, first by study staff and then by a senior entomologist in a subset of 25%.

129

After imaging, mosquitoes were dissected between the thorax and abdomen, and these parts

130

were stored in separate tubes packed with desiccant at room temperature.

132

Molecular detection of parasites and human blood in mosquitoes

133

Mosquito specimens were manually disrupted in individual tubes and then genomic DNA was

134

extracted using a Chelex-100 protocol. Each gDNA extract was tested in a duplex TaqMan real-

135

time PCR assay targeting both P. falciparum and human beta-tubulin [23]. Samples were tested

136

in duplicate in 384-well plates on an ABI Quantstudio 6 platform; threshold lines were set

137

manually in the exponential phase of amplification. Reaction plates were prepared in dedicated

138

workspaces with filtered pipet tips, and each included P. falciparum gDNA and human DNA as

positive controls and molecular-grade water as a negative control. Genomic DNA was extracted

140

from human dried blood spots and tested in the same real-time PCR assay.

141
142

Data analysis

143

The primary outcome was malaria, which was defined as self-reported illness leading to a positive

144

malaria RDT result in the preceding 30 days. Test results were confirmed by reviewing the medical

145

record whenever possible. Following a positive test, individuals were censored for 21 days. The

146

primary objective of our analysis was to estimate the impact of household-level mosquito indices

147

on an individual’s risk of malaria. We investigated the impact of four different mosquito indices,

148

calculated for each household in each month as the sum of the counts from weekly mosquito

149

collection visits: the total number of 1) female Anopheles, 2) blood-fed female Anopheles, 3)

150

female Anopheles mosquitoes collected with human blood detected by PCR in the abdomen, and

151

4) female Anopheles with P falciparum sporozoites detected in the head. Due to collinearity

152

between the exposures (e.g. the number of sporozoite positive mosquitoes being a subset of the

153

total number of mosquitoes collected, etc.), separate models were fit for the effect of each

154

exposure on each morbidity outcome.

155
156

We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), with the outcome defined as the presence or

157

absence of malaria for each individual at each follow-up month. To estimate relative risks, we

158

used a robust (modified) Poisson model [24]. To account for clustering by household, the model

159

included a random intercept on household with a compound symmetric covariance structure

160

(note that this assumes household clustering is constant over time). To account for clustering

161

within individual over time, the model included a random intercept on individual, nested within

162

household, with a homogenous first-order autoregressive covariance structure. Each model

163

included a fixed-effect for village, age at baseline (coded as a categorical variable with five-levels:

164

<=1, 1-5, 6-10, 11-17, and >=18 years), gender, and number of nights of ITN use in the past week

165

(dichotomized as >=6 and <6 nights). Additionally, we investigated interactions between the

166

mosquito exposure variables and ITN use.

167
168

In order to quantify the amount of variability in individual incidence that could be explained by

169

the model covariates, we sequentially estimated marginal R2 for generalized linear mixed models,

170

following the method of [25]. Marginal R2 allows for assessment of the impact of the fixed effects

171

independent of the random effect structure of the model. Starting with the null model, we added

172

covariates sequentially in order of the magnitude of their fixed effect from the full model, until

173

all demographic adjustment factors were included. Finally, each mosquito exposure variable, and

174

its interaction with ITN use, were added one at a time to this adjusted model.

175
176

Secondary exploratory objectives included investigating the impact of including in the model

177

covariates related to individual travel history (e.g. using a bed-net while traveling, traveling to a

178

malaria endemic area, etc.), the number of hours spent under a bed-net each night, and the

179

number of individuals living in the household.

Results

190

From June 12, 2017 until July 31, 2018, 254 participants from 38 households were followed by

191

monthly active surveillance and weekly entomological surveillance for a total of 2,624 person

192

months of observation. The cohort demographics are described in Table 1. Sixty percent of

193

participants were children less than 18 years of age at enrollment and each person provided an

194

average of 11.1 months of follow-up. At enrollment, 54.9% (133/242) of participants were

195

infected with P. falciparum as detected by a highly-sensitive PCR assay. 72% of participants had

196

an ITN for their sleeping space; this proportion was slightly lower in Village S (59%) compared to

197

Village K and M (82% and 78%, respectively). In 76.7% (2,013/2,624) of monthly follow-ups,

198

participants reported sleeping under their net each day of the previous seven days.

200

Mosquito indices

201

Across 2,092 household-days, we collected a total of 1,494 female anopheles mosquitoes (Table

202

2, Figure 1). Nearly 90% (n=1,023) were identified as Anopheles gambiae group and this

203

proportion varied only slightly across the villages. Village M recorded the highest number of

204

malaria vectors overall (66.5 per household) and the highest proportion of An. funestus (9.3%).

205

Other Anopheles spp. were observed at low frequencies. By microscopic evaluation, the majority

206

of mosquitoes had recently fed: 11.2% (n=168) were freshly bloodfed, 31.9% (n=477) were half

207

gravid, and 39% (n=587) were gravid. In PCR testing, we detected human blood in 51.9% of all

208

abdomens (n=776), including 79.8% (n=134) of the freshly bloodfed specimens. The prevalence

209

of P. falciparum sporozoites in the heads of female Anopheles was 9.2% (n=134). The proportions

210

of mosquitoes with human blood or sporozoites did not differ by species or village.

211
212

Malaria incidence

213

During 2,624 person-months of follow-up, there were 168 cases of malaria in 107 people (Figure

214

1), yielding an overall incidence rate of 0.064 (95% CI: 0.055, 0.075) cases per person-month.

215

Among these 107 people, 66 (61.7%) reported only a single episode, 26 (24.3%) reported two

216

episodes, and 15 (14.0%) reported 3 or more episodes (the maximum was 5). The median number

217

of days between sequential episodes was 37 (IQR: 62). Overall, 30% (n=74) of participants

218

experienced 80% (n=135) of episodes (Supplemental Figure 1) and 58% (n=147) of participants

219

never experienced an episode of malaria.

220
221

Associations between mosquito indices and malaria

222

We estimated the relative risk of malaria in models without and with each of our mosquito

223

indices (Table 3). As expected, the risk of malaria declined with increasing age, and there was no

224

association with gender (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.72 – 1.40). Relative to high ITN users, those with low

225

use were at similar risk (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.76 – 1.79). In models with individual mosquito indices,

11

226

malaria risk was not significantly associated with the monthly household abundance of malaria

227

vectors (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.97 – 1.08) nor the number of mosquitoes who had human blood in

228

their abdomen (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97 – 1.12). However, the risk of malaria increased by 24% with

229

each additional infectious mosquito collected the previous month (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.11 – 1.38).

230
231

Because high ITN use was not associated with a reduced risk of malaria, we hypothesized that

232

ITN use may modify the effect of mosquito exposure on malaria risk. We tested this hypothesis

233

by examining the interaction between ITN use and each mosquito exposure variable (Table 4).

234

We demonstrate significant correlation between both mosquito abundance and malaria risk, and

235

mosquito feeding success and malaria risk, in models that include the exposure:ITN interaction

236

term. The relative risk of malaria among high ITN users compared to low ITN users decreased by

237

6% (RR=0.94, 95%CI: 0.89-0.99) for each additional anopheles mosquito in the household and by

238

10% (RR=0.90, 95%CI: 0.82-0.99) for each additional human-fed mosquito. ITN use now appears

239

positively correlated with malaria risk in models that include the interaction term, however, we

240

can understand this when we examine the results graphically (Figure 2). At low mosquito

241

abundance, individuals with high ITN use have equal or slightly elevated malaria risk compared

242

to those who have lower ITN use. However, the risk of malaria increases linearly with increasing

243

mosquito exposure among those with low ITN use, but remains low and constant for those who

244

use an ITN consistently. Similar trends are seen for mosquito feeding success and human feeding

245

success.

247

In analyses of marginal R2 with incorporation of mosquito indices in malaria risk models, age,

248

household size, and exposure to sporozoite-infected mosquitoes accounted for the largest

249

increase in R2 (2.6%, 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively; Figure 3). Other mosquito exposures accounted

250

for only a very small proportion of the heterogeneity. Despite the small absolute change in R2, it

251

is interesting to note that household exposure to infectious mosquitoes and age contribute

252

nearly equally to explaining the distribution of malaria incidence in the population.

253
254

Discussion:

255

In this high-resolution paired entomological and epidemiological cohort, we measured weekly

256

household-level mosquito exposure alongside laboratory-confirmed malaria episodes in a

257

population-based sample of 254 individuals in 38 households. We show that, among putative

258

entomological indices, the risk of malaria in humans is mediated by neither the abundance of

259

mosquitoes overall nor those that are blood-fed mosquitoes but rather only by the risk of

260

malaria in mosquitoes (sporozoites). We further demonstrate an interaction between the effect

261

of ITN use and mosquito exposure on malaria episodes, in that, compared to suboptimal ITN

262

use, high ITN use attenuates the deleterious effects of vector density and feeding success on

263

the risk of malaria.

264
265

The relationship between mosquito exposure and human malaria risk is difficult to quantify due

266

to the time lag between an infectious bite and patent infection, and the uncertainty in assigning

267

individual exposure based on entomological variables. Some studies compare population based

268

measures of disease prevalence or incidence with vector density observed at sentinel locations

269

and are essentially ecological comparisons of two populations over time [6, 15]. Alternatively,

270

values from sentinel households are locally extrapolated to unmeasured households [4, 7-9].

271

Although we fall short of assigning individual exposure, which may vary within a household [26,

272

27], our weekly household-level entomological measurements give new insight into the nature

273

of the relationship between mosquito exposure and disease and a means to estimate the

274

change in risk under different exposure control strategies. For example, since both the effect of

275

mosquito abundance and feeding success on malaria morbidity are moderated by individual ITN

276

use, we can estimate a personal protective efficacy of ITN use of up to 30% as exposure

277

increases. In households where as few as 8 mosquitoes were collected in a month, ITNs offer

278

measurable protection relative to those who do not use an ITN. The low, but non-zero, malaria

279

risk experienced by consistent ITN users may reflect exposure outside of the net, due to

280

modified mosquito behaviors such as biting early in the evening or outdoors [28-32].

281
282

Our findings relating risk of malaria to basic demographic factors are consistent with previous

283

studies. We and others [3, 4, 33-35] measure declining incidence of clinical malaria with

284

increasing age. The observation that increasing household size is associated with decreasing

285

individual risk can be interpreted as reduced individual risk of exposure when more hosts are

286

available. Although individual ITN use has been associated with reduced risk of malaria in

287

291

exposures, the proportional amount of heterogeneity explained increased by 36%, however the

292

absolute value of R2 remained small.

293
294

There are notable limitations to this study. First, the time span is relatively short (13 months); a

295

longer duration of observation would be desirable to capture important annual variation in

296

transmission and exposure. Second, the malaria morbidity outcome is based on recall over a

297

one-month period. However, we mitigated possible recall bias and missing information by

298

reviewing medical records to confirm test results and ensuring affordably, timely and accurate

299

malaria diagnosis was available to participants.

300
301

Despite these limitations, we demonstrate that infections in mosquitoes within a household are

302

a direct risk factor for infections in individuals. This risk is not mitigated by ITN use. Other

303

entomological exposures measured at the household-level, including malaria vector density and

304

human-fed anopheles, increase the risk of malaria episodes differentially in individuals who do

305

not use an ITN consistently. We show that individual protective efficacy of ITNs scales with

306

exposure and fine-scaled entomological measures can explain as much heterogeneity in malaria

307

risk in the population as age.
