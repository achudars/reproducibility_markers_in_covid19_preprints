Summary (40/40 words): US Infantry trainees were followed through training for MRSA skin and soft tissue
infection, swabbing for colonization at 2-4 week intervals. Sequencing suggests serial importations of diverse strains
on base, followed by transmission mostly within platoons, involving multiple anatomical sites.

Abstract – 246/250 words

46

Background. MRSA skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is a significant cause of morbidity in

47

military trainees. To guide interventions, it is critical we understand the epidemiology of MRSA

48

in this population.

49

Methods. Two cohorts (‘companies’) of US Army Infantry trainees (N=343) at Fort Benning,

50

GA, USA, were followed during their training cycles (Jun.-Dec. 2015). Trainees had nares,

51

oropharynx, perianal and inguinal areas swabbed for MRSA colonization at five ~2-4 week

52

intervals, and monitored for SSTI throughout training. Epidemiological data were collected.

53

Isolates were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq and NovaSeq. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms

54

and clusters were identified. Multi-locus sequence type (MLST) and antimicrobial resistance

55

genes were predicted from de novo assemblies.

56

Results. 87 trainees were positive at least once for MRSA (12 had SSTI, 2 without any

57

colonization). Excluding those positive at baseline, 43.7% were colonized within the first month

58

of training. 244/254 samples were successfully sequenced (including all SSTI). ST8 (n=135,

59

100% of SSTI), ST5 (n=81) and ST87 (n=21) were the most represented. Three main Clusters

60

were identified, largely corresponding to these STs. Sub-analyses within Clusters showed

61

multiple importations of MRSA, with transmission subsequently predominantly within, rather

62

than between, platoons in each company. Over 50% of trainees were colonized only at other

63

anatomical sites; restricting analyses to nares missed substantial transmission.

64

Conclusions. Serial importations of MRSA into this high-risk setting likely contribute to the

65

ongoing burden of MRSA colonization and infection among military trainees. Sampling multiple

66

anatomical sites is critical for comprehensive characterization of MRSA transmission.

Introduction

69

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a major

70

cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) [1]. Military personnel have an elevated risk of

71

MRSA SSTI compared to the general population with new recruits disproportionately affected

72

[2, 3]. SSTI outbreaks compromise not only training cycles, but also operational readiness

73

among deployed forces [4]. The annual cost of SSTIs to the US military is approximately 14-32

74

million US dollars [5]. Past SSTI prevention strategies in military populations have included

75

nasal decolonization [6] as well as chlorhexidine-based body wash [7, 8], based on the principle

76

that MRSA colonization precedes and is necessary for infection [9]. However, neither strategy

77

prevented SSTI in these high-risk populations [6, 8].

78

79

To develop effective prevention strategies, it is critical we understand the epidemiology and

80

transmission dynamics of MRSA in this population. Recently, whole genome sequencing (WGS)

81

has been used to describe the epidemiology of MRSA colonization [4] and infection among US

82

Army trainees [10]. A key limitation of this study was that WGS was restricted to trainees with

83

pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type USA300 MRSA, the most common cause of CA-

84

MRSA SSTI. As such, the conclusions that could be drawn about overall MRSA transmission

85

dynamics, and prevalence of different strains circulating in this population, were greatly limited.

86

To address this concern, we conducted a prospective cohort study of MRSA in the same trainee

87

population, following them throughout their training cycle for colonization and infection events.

88

All MRSA-positive samples from multiple anatomical sites were included.

90

Our study found a high prevalence of MRSA colonization at baseline, comprising a genetically

91

diverse population imported from across the US by recruits entering basic training. This was

92

followed by substantial person-to-person transmission, particularly among soldiers belonging to

93

the same ‘platoons’ (i.e., those in the same training company who share the same living

94

quarters). Moreover, the observed transmission events frequently involved different anatomical

95

sites - irrespective of nasal colonization. As nasal swabs are routinely and almost exclusively

96

used to detect MRSA colonization in clinical settings, this suggests MRSA transmission may be

97

drastically under-estimated with current infection control methodology – a finding with

98

significant implications for the control of MRSA.

Methods

101

Overview. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of SSTI among US Army Infantry trainees

102

at Fort Benning, Georgia, from June-December 2015. Two companies (designated A and B)

103

were included, which commenced the 14-week training cycle at two different timepoints during

104

peak SSTI seasons (June and September, respectively). Infantry training companies are

105

comprised of ~200 soldiers, further segregated into four platoons comprised of ~50 soldiers. See

106

Supplementary Methods for additional detail.

107

108

MRSA screening. MRSA colonization swabs were obtained at baseline and at ~2-4 week

109

intervals over five study visits. [6] Anterior nasal, oropharyngeal, inguinal and perianal swabs

110

were collected (see Supplementary Methods). Swabs were initially processed at the Benning

111

Martin Army Community Hospital clinical microbiology laboratory as previously described [8].

Epidemiologic data collection. Trainees completed questionnaires at baseline for demographic

114

and MRSA risk factor information, and at follow-up visits to collect data on personal hygiene

115

practices.

116

117

SSTI case definition. Trainees were considered to have probable SSTI if they presented with

118

cellulitis, abscess, folliculitis, impetigo, paronychia, infected blister, or pilonidal cyst; SSTI cases

119

were defined as those with S. aureus cultured from the clinical site. Case detection is described

120

in the Supplementary Methods.

121

122

Genome sequencing and bioinformatics. See Supplementary Methods for details. In brief,

123

genomes were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq and NovaSeq platforms. As most samples

124

were known to be USA300, we initially aligned reads to the USA300 TCH1516 reference

125

genome (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] Accession CP000730.1) using

126

the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner MEM algorithm (v.0.7.15, [12]) and identified variants compared

127

to this reference. Prophage sequences were identified using Phaster (http://phaster.ca, [13]) and

128

SNPs in these regions were masked.

129

130

Concatenated SNP alignments were used to generate maximum likelihood trees with IQ-TREE

131

(v.1.6.8, [14]). To infer a more accurate phylogeny for the analysis including all STs, we masked

132

predicted recombination sites using Gubbins (v.2.3.4, [15]). Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of

133

Population Structure (RhierBAPS v.1.1.0, [16]) was used to discriminate clusters of closely-

134

related samples in R (v.3.5.2). Analyses were then repeated for each major Cluster identified

135

using a closely-related reference genome.

De novo assemblies were also generated, using SPAdes (v.3.8.0, [17]) and Unicycler (v.0.4.7,

137

Wick R, https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler). Sequence Types (STs) according to the multi-

138

locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme [18] were predicted using ‘mlst’ (v.2.10, Seemann T,

139

https://github.com/tseemann/mlst) and Abricate (v.0.8, Seemann T,

140

https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) was used with ResFinder [19] and the Virulence Factor

141

DataBase (VFDB, [20]) to detect genes associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence,

142

respectively. mupA and qacA genes were predicted using gene-puller.py

143

(https://github.com/kwongj/gene-puller).

144

145

Statistical analysis. Categorical comparisons were done using the Chi-Square test where cell

146

counts > 5, or Fisher’s Exact test if otherwise. Distributions were compared using the Wilcoxon-

147

Mann-Whitney test. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare hygiene variables

148

between trainees who became colonized with time-matched, MRSA-negative controls

149

(Supplementary Methods). Analyses were done in Stata15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,

Results

160

We followed two Infantry training companies in the summer and fall of 2015. 343 trainees

161

participated (132 and 211 in companies A and B, respectively), with 86.6% (297/343) completed

162

all study visits (Supplementary Results). 87 (25.4%) of trainees were MRSA-positive during

163

the study; 85 had at least one positive colonization swab and 12 were diagnosed with MRSA

164

SSTI. Among the latter, only seven were colonized prior to or at the same time as their SSTI

165

(five with the infecting strain); three were colonized only at later timepoints, and two were never

166

colonized (Supplementary Table 1).

167

168

Among those colonized, thirty-five had a single positive sample; the oropharynx and perianal

169

sites were most frequently colonized, each representing 31.4% of swabs, followed by nasal

170

(20.0%), and inguinal (17.1%) sites. Fifty trainees were colonized at multiple anatomical sites

171

and/or timepoints. The number of repeat positive samples did not differ significantly by

172

anatomical site of isolation (p = 0.16), although inguinal swabs tended to be less frequently

173

positive (Figure 1).

174

175

Risk factors for colonization or infection

176

There were no significant differences in age, self-reported race, or MRSA risk factors at baseline

177

(Table 1) comparing those with colonization/infection to those who were never MRSA-positive.

Epidemiological characteristics of SSTI cases are described in the Supplementary Results.

Timing of MRSA acquisition

183

Twenty-seven trainees were colonized at baseline (see Supplementary Results). Excluding

184

these, most trainees appeared to have acquired MRSA shortly after starting training (Figure 2);

185

43.7% of all positive samples were collected during the first month of training. There were no

186

significant differences in personal hygiene practices over the same timepoint between trainees

187

with new colonization and those who were never positive (Supplementary Results,

188

Supplementary Table 2).

189

190

Genomic analyses

191

High-quality sequencing data was available for 244/254 (96.1%) MRSA-positive samples from

192

85 individuals; further analyses presented are restricted to this subset. ST8 (USA300) was the

193

dominant strain identified (Table 2), and included all cases of SSTI. The virulence factor

194

Panton-Valentine Leukocidin was present in all clinical isolates (as demonstrated by intact lukS

195

and lukF genes) and nearly half of colonization isolates (Table 2). All samples were PCR-

196

positive for mecA, while 98.8% were predicted to have mecA in silico; 2/3 isolates lacking mecA

197

in silico were different STs than other isolates from those trainees, indicating that mixed

198

genotypes may have been present at sampling (Supplementary Table 3). To assess the potential

199

utility of mupirocin and chlorhexidine for decolonization, mupA and qacA genes were predicted.

200

mupA was only detected in colonization isolates (all ST5) from four trainees (and one ST8

201

clinical isolate from another trainee), while qacA was detected in colonization isolates from three

202

trainees. Correlation between PFGE and ST are shown in Supplementary Table 4.

Strain replacement

206

Strain replacement was rare (Supplementary Figure 1), occurring only four times during the

207

study (excluding co-colonization). Two instances involved different STs; trainee 2013 was

208

initially colonized with an ST5 strain but developed an ST8-SSTI, while 2031 was colonized

209

with ST8 but later colonized with ST5. The remaining instances involved trainees 1007 and

210

2061. These trainees had isolates from the same ST that were separated from their later isolates

211

by > 97 core SNPs, suggestive of exogenous re-infection.

212

213

Overall transmission analyses

214

See Supplementary Results for quality metrics. The recombination-adjusted maximum

215

likelihood tree is shown in Figure 3, excluding one highly divergent isolate (1134_5N, see

216

Supplementary Results). Five Clusters were identified, with three containing >1 isolate;

217

Cluster-1 (n=139, 97.1% ST8); Cluster-2 (n=81, all ST5); and Cluster-4 (n=21, all ST87).

218

Pairwise adjusted core SNP distances between isolates indicate that transmission was

219

predominantly within, rather than between, platoons in the same Companies (Figure 4).

220

221

Sub-analyses of transmission, by Cluster

222

To provide the highest resolution, analyses were re-run for each Cluster using a closely-related

223

reference (Supplementary Table 5). As ST8s represent the largest proportion of samples

224

collected, the maximum likelihood tree for Cluster 1 is shown in Figure 5 (see Supplementary

225

Figures 2 and 3 for Clusters 2 and 4, respectively). Within Cluster 1, there were nine sub-groups

226

each representing isolates from 1 to 24 trainees. These sub-groups were separated from one

227

another by a minimum of 34 SNPs (Table 3). In nearly all sub-groups, there were isolates from

different trainees that shared close genetic relationships, indicative of recent transmission (Table

229

3). Overlaying company and platoon (Figure 5) suggests that such transmission was largely

230

restricted to the same platoons, with a small amount across platoons in the same company.

231

Isolates from different companies were only found in the largest sub-group (1-1), with as few as

232

6 core SNPs separating them (including repeat isolates per trainee, the median core SNP distance

233

was 71 across companies, IQR 35-100). Given these companies were separated in time and

234

space, this suggests undetected transmission via an intermediate source.

235

236

Nearly all transmission appears to be within rather than between platoons for Clusters 2 and 4 as

237

well (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). The exception to this was sub-group 1 in Cluster 4,

238

where multiple platoons are implicated; however, all six trainees in this sub-group were

239

colonized at baseline (Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table 6). There was no

240

evidence of transmission across companies in either Cluster.

241

242

Anatomical sites and their role in transmission

243

The nares are commonly thought to play a key role in transmission, but > 50% of trainees

244

(regardless of Cluster/ST) were positive only at other anatomical sites (Table 3). To examine the

245

impact of this, we repeated our transmission analyses only including isolates from the nares and

246

SSTI (Supplementary Table 7) and found that transmission was substantially under-estimated,

247

with as many as 100% of trainees being missed in some Clusters/sub-groups.

ST8s in context of previous analyses

252

We compared our contemporaneous samples to historical clinical and colonization isolates from

253

trainees with ST8-associated SSTI at Fort Benning [4, 10] (described further in the

254

Supplementary Results), and found historical isolates largely clustered independently of more

255

recent samples (Supplementary Figure 4). The median core pairwise distance between these

256

isolates and our 2015 samples was 111 SNPs (IQR 80-137). 99% of pairs (14,187/14,385) were

257

separated by > 15 SNPs, suggesting a single reservoir of MRSA is unlikely to be driving ongoing

258

transmission of ST8-MRSA on base.

259

260

Discussion

261

MRSA SSTI continues to be a major source of morbidity in military trainees in the United States

262

[2, 3] and other countries [21, 22]. In this study, we integrated genomics with comprehensive

263

epidemiologic data to investigate MRSA transmission in US Army Infantry trainees at Fort

264

Benning, GA, a group known to be at increased risk for MRSA colonization and infection.

265

266

We followed individuals prospectively through training for MRSA colonization and SSTI,

267

including all positive colonization isolates from these trainees over time. We found there were

268

multiple STs present at baseline, with subsequent transmission predominantly within, rather than

269

between platoons - reinforcing the importance of close proximity for MRSA transmission.

270

Consistent with previous ST8 analyses [4, 10], there appeared to be little transmission across

271

training classes (i.e., companies) over time, suggesting no single endemic strain in this context.

272

By contrast, the persistent burden of MRSA colonization and infection is likely due to the serial

273

importation of CA-MRSA strains with each incoming group of new trainees. With > 30,000

trainees from multiple US states and territories cycling through Fort Benning annually, the

275

diversity of MRSA strains being introduced into this single geographic site is likely considerable.

276

277

Surprisingly, a large proportion of trainees (27/343, [7.9%]) were positive at baseline or positive

278

shortly after training onset. This suggests that particular phases of training may serve as critical

279

‘control points’ wherein interventions to reduce transmission and/or SSTI could be implemented.

280

As no specific risk factors for MRSA colonization were identified, we propose that risk of

281

acquisition may be predominantly mediated by exposure to circulating strains and shared training

282

activities, rather than individual hygiene practices - though it is possible the small numbers may

283

preclude detection of significant differences between our comparison groups.

284

285

The nares are considered the primary reservoir for S. aureus [23]. In the current study, however,

286

we found that more than half (55.3%) of those colonized were exclusively positive at other

287

anatomical sites. Screening of these different sites is therefore critical to accurately detect

288

colonization and resolve transmission. This finding may have important implications for the

289

control of MRSA in military trainees, as MRSA prevalence, transmission, and success of

290

decolonization efforts, have previously been largely estimated from nasal carriage alone [24]. A

291

randomized controlled trial among Army combat medics in training [6] found that, while

292

intranasal mupirocin reduced nasal colonization with MRSA, SSTI rates remained unaffected.

293

Similar results were found in a large-scale, field-based evaluation of chlorhexidine-based body

294

wash [7, 8]. One possibility is that inoculation via fomites may contribute to SSTI, however,

295

another possibility is that trainees colonized exclusively at non-nasal sites (not included in these

296

explanations need not be mutually exclusive. This suggests that, given the negligible levels of

298

resistance to either treatment, mupirocin coupled with chlorhexidine gluconate washes may yet

299

be viable tools for SSTI reduction in this population, potentially coupled with oral antimicrobials

300

[25]. However, for such interventions to work, this would likely require all colonized individuals

301

are identified and treated, regardless of anatomical site.

302

303

This study has a number of major strengths, including a high participation rate with > 85% of

304

participants completing all visits. Because this was conducted in a military training setting, the

305

schedule, location, type of activities, and risk of MRSA acquisition were relatively uniform for

306

trainees across all platoons at all visits. Additionally, the prospective design, with screening for

307

colonization and collection of corresponding epidemiological data at regular intervals throughout

308

training allowed us to detect such events as they occurred and assess the potential association

309

with specific behaviours that preceded them. This degree of follow-up is rarely feasible outside

310

of a hospital setting. Another strength was the screening of multiple anatomical sites over time;

311

this not only allowed us to more accurately detect colonization than previous studies in this

312

population [6, 7, 24] but examine the role they play in transmission. Finally, previous studies

313

focused exclusively on ST8, with sampling exclusively from cases of SSTI and select controls

314

[4, 10]; by including all STs, we were able to provide the first fully comprehensive analysis of

315

population structure and transmission dynamics of MRSA circulating in this setting.

316

317

There are several limitations of this work. Due to resource requirements, we focused recruitment

318

on two (out of 37) training classes from Jun. - Dec. 2015. Though our analysis suggests limited

319

transmission across companies (i.e., classes), it is possible some transmission events were not

detected. Permanent staff on base (e.g. drill sergeants, health care personnel, etc.) may also

321

represent a reservoir of MRSA, though our analysis suggest this is less likely (as there were

322

multiple circulating strains, with evidence of importation from outside the base). Staff may also

323

be source of unrecognized transmission, potentially even during in-processing, but unfortunately,

324

were not included in the current study. Similarly, sampling of high touch common surfaces (e.g.

325

countertops, weight benches, wrestling mats, etc.) was not conducted as part of this investigation.

326

Future studies should address these gaps, to better understand the role these may play in MRSA

327

transmission dynamics.

328

329

We also note that the included cohorts were purposely chosen based on peak MRSA SSTI

330

seasonality [8], with some studies reporting increased colonization in warmer months [26, 27].

331

MRSA prevalence in our classes may therefore be higher than would be found in other cohorts.

332

However, baseline prevalence of MRSA colonization among combat medic trainees [6] in Jan. –

333

Dec. 2005 was only 3.9% (based on nasal carriage) and restricting our estimates to nasal carriage

334

yielded a similar proportion (2.0%, p=0.08), suggesting our findings are likely generalizable to

335

other training courses and/or periods Another potential limitation of this work is that, for privacy

336

reasons, perianal and inguinal swabs were collected by the trainees themselves, rather than by

337

study personnel. Though they were instructed beforehand, it is possible these swabs were not

338

collected in a consistent fashion and may be more likely to yield false negative results. However,

339

we did not find a significant difference in frequency of positivity across anatomical sites. Finally,

340

personal hygiene practices were self-reported at routine study visits for the preceding month,

341

potentially leading to misclassification due to poor recall. However, as colonization status was

not known at the time of collecting this information (and was not reported to trainees during the

343

study), we would not expect this misclassification to be differential.

344

345

Through this in-depth study, we identified critical timepoints in military training associated with

346

MRSA colonization and highlight the importance of different anatomical sites in mediating this

347

transmission. Given our historical reliance on nasal screening for detection of MRSA

348

colonization, and subsequent interventions to prevent infection, this work may have important

349

implications not only for control of MRSA in the military, but in-patient settings as well. In order

350

to halt MRSA transmission in the military, and other vulnerable populations, increased screening

351

to include these other anatomical sites may be necessary; however, cost and feasibility of such

352

interventions must also be investigated.

Clusters were identified in the analysis including all samples, using hierBAPS [16]. Core SNPs within each Cluster were then identified by repeating the analysis,
but aligning the reads from isolates within each Cluster to a closely-related reference from the most represented sequence type in that Cluster. hierBAPS [16] was
then run again for each Cluster using these new alignments as input (to obtain the highest resolution), and sub-groups of closely-related isolates were identified
within each Cluster. The number of core SNPs were tabulated within each sub-group and are comparable within, but not across, Clusters (as each Cluster has a
different core genome). Cluster 1 sub-groups were separated by a minimum of 34 core SNPs, Cluster 2 sub-groups were separated by a minimum of 150 core
SNPs, and Cluster 4 sub-groups were separated by a minimum of 100 core SNPs. Cluster 1 was predominantly ST8 (n=136/139); three non-ST8 isolates were
included based on hierBAPS analysis, including 1133_2P (a single locus variant of ST8), 1105_5P (a triple locus variant of ST8) and 1133_2P (ST72, a triple
locus variant of ST8). These three non-ST8 isolates were included in sub-group 1-1, and were a maximum of 383 core SNPs to another other sample within this
sub-group. Cluster 2 was comprised of all ST5 isolates, while Cluster 4 was comprised of all ST87 isolates.

Figure 3. Maximum likelihood tree for colonization and clinical samples from trainees

522

undergoing basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia in 2015. One isolate (1134_5N) was

523

highly divergent from all others, at > 18,500 core SNPs compared to < 1000 SNPs for the next

524

most divergent. Therefore, this isolate was excluded from this analysis. A concatenated SNP

525

alignment of the remaining isolates was produced using snp-sites [28] and IQ-Tree [14] (v1.6.8)

526

was used to produce the maximum likelihood tree, using the TVMe model with ascertainment

527

bias correction. Model selection was based on the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion.

528

Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (hierBAPS) [16, 29] was used to identify

529

clusters with the full alignment as input. The tree was visualized using the Interactive Tree of

530

Life [30]. Samples from skin and soft tissue infection are indicated.

538

Core SNPs were identified compared to the USA300 reference (excluding isolate 1134_5N due

539

to its high divergence from all others isolates in the dataset). This resulted in 29,403 pairwise

540

comparisons between trainees, including repeat samples from the same individuals. Retaining

541

closely-related samples from the same trainees would be expected to artificially reduce the

542

pairwise distances within companies and platoons. Therefore, where repeat samples from a

543

single participant were within 5 SNPs of one another, only one of these was retained for this

544

analysis. This threshold was chosen because it represented 90% of pairs from the same trainees.

545

In total, 3,739 pairwise comparisons were therefore included in this analysis. Note that all

546

trainees in the same platoon are, by default, in the same company.

Figure 5. In-depth analysis of Cluster-1 and potential transmission within and across

550

platoons. There were 139 isolates in Cluster-1, as classified by hierBAPs [16, 29] in the overall

551

analysis (Figure 3), 136 of which were ST8. A concatenated core SNP alignment was produced

552

with these isolates. A maximum likelihood tree was produced using IQ-Tree [14] (v1.6.8) and

553

visualized using ggtree [31] in R (v.3.5.2). hierBAPS was again used to identify sub-groups of

554

closely-related isolates within this Cluster, which are indicated in colour. Note that this analysis

555

includes repeat isolates from all trainees; sample names are indicated using the format

556

Participant Identifier + Visit Number + Anatomical Site of Isolation (where N=nasal, I=Inguinal,

557

P=Perianal and O=Oropharyngeal), such that repeat samples can be identified. The heatmap
