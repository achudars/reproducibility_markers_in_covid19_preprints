Abstract
Background: Although advances in the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs)
have led to improvements in classification and diagnosis and most importantly to new
therapies, the unmet medical needs remain significant due to high treatment failure rates. The
AETIONOMY project funded by the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) aims at using
multi-OMICs and bioinformatics to identify new classifications for NDDs based on common
molecular pathophysiological mechanisms in view of improving the availability of
personalised treatments.

Objectives: The purpose of the AETIONOMY cross-sectional study is to validate novel
patient classification criteria provided by these tools.

Methods: This was a European multi centre, cross-sectional, clinical study conducted at 6
sites in 3 countries. Standardised clinical data, biosamples from peripheral blood,
cerebrospinal fluid, skin biopsies, and data from a multi-OMICs approach were collected in
patients suffering from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, as well as healthy controls.

Results: From September 2015 to December 2017 a total of 421 participants were recruited
including 95 Healthy Controls. Nearly 1,500 biological samples were collected. The study
achieved its objective with respect to Parkinson’s disease (PD) recruitment, however it was
unable to recruit many new Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. Overall, data from 413
evaluable subjects (405 PD and 8 AD) are available for analysis. PD patients and controls
were well matched with respect to age (mean 63.4 years), however, close gender matching
was not achieved. Approximately half of all PD patients and one At-Risk subject were taking
dopamine agonists; rates of Levodopa usage were slightly higher (~60%). Median MDSUPDRS Part III Scores (OFF state) ranged from 45 (SD 18) in those with Genetic PD to 2
(SD 3) in Healthy Controls. The standardised methodologies applied resulted in a high-quality
database with very few missing data.

Conclusion: This is one of the collaborative multi-OMICs studies in individuals suffering
from PD and AD involving a control group. It is expected that the integration of data will
provide new biomarker-led descriptions of clusters of patient subgroups.

Introduction
Dementia, mainly represented by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), affects 44 million people
globally, and that figure is set to rise to 135 million by 2050, mostly due to the ageing of the
population.1 Meanwhile an estimated 4-6 million people globally suffer from Parkinson’s
disease (PD), the second cause of neurodegenerative disease.2 There is no cure for these
devastating diseases, and caring for patients as their disease progresses represents an immense
burden for family members, carers, and health and social care systems. The way these
diseases are classified is hampering efforts to develop effective, targeted treatments.
Currently, diseases are defined largely on the basis of the patient’s symptoms and where they
occur in the body. There is growing evidence that while two patients may be classified as
having the same disease, the genetic or molecular causes of their symptoms may be very
different. In other cases, diseases that are currently defined as separate conditions may share a
common molecular basis. There is therefore now broad recognition that the way diseases are
classified needs to change, and the field of neurodegenerative diseases in particular is
considered to be ripe for a rethink.3
AETIONOMY was a European project funded by the Innovative Medicine Initiative which
intended to develop tools to better classify patients into subgroups based on their underlying
pathogenic mechanisms (http://www.aetionomy.eu). During the lifetime of the project the
team explored the classification of neurodegenerative disease by dissecting molecular causes
of disease and exploring links to clinical evidence. An important activity for the project was
the evaluation, and ultimate organisation, of historical data from a range of sources pertaining
to the field. This knowledgebase formed the genesis of mechanistic hypotheses that, alongside
canonical theories for the drivers of neurodegeneration, were evaluated utilising
computational4 and conventional laboratory methodologies. To facilitate these objectives, a
prospective cross-sectional study was initiated that aimed to support the clinical validation of
the identified mechanisms in both AD and PD patients. The present publication provides
details of the study design, the patient population and their baseline clinical characteristics. It
also highlights the study management strategy and the standardised methodologies
implemented to ensure quality of the data and sample collection.

Material and methods
Study design
This is a European multi-centre, cross-sectional clinical study, aimed at collecting clinical,
brain imaging and biological data on AD and PD patients, individuals at risk of AD and PD,
and healthy controls. The primary objective of the study was to validate the new taxonomy of
neurodegenerative diseases proposed by the AETIONOMY Consortium in a real cohort of
patients, representative of the continuum of AD and PD. Secondary objectives were to
describe the correlations between clinical features and biomarkers across neurodegenerative
diseases.
Participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the two groups of patients (AD and PD) and their
matching controls are described in detail in Table S1. For the PD group, subjects were:
patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD according to UK PD Society Brain Brank,5 and a
disease duration less than 10 years at inclusion; patients with autosomal dominant (SNCA,
LRRK2 or GBA) or autosomal recessive (PARK2) forms of PD; a group of subjects “at risk of
PD” defined as subjects without symptom of PD but either being a first degree relatives of
patients with an autosomal dominant form of PD, or subjects with polysomnographyconfirmed idiopathic REM sleep behavioural disorders; healthy subjects matched for age and
gender without symptoms of PD or other neurological disorders were recruited as controls.
For the AD group, we initially aimed to recruit subjects with biologically confirmed AD at
the clinical stage, at the prodromal stage, and matched healthy controls. However, we decided
to stop enrolment of the AD group shortly after the recruitment started because another IMIfunded project was planning to build a prodromal AD cohort (European Prevention of
Alzheimer’s Dementia (EPAD) Longitudinal Cohort Study (LCS), http://ep-ad.org/). The
AETIONOMY study thus finally mainly focused on the PD group.
Study procedures
Subjects were recruited in six University Hospitals in France (Pitié-Salpêtrière (Paris),
Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Besançon), Germany (Bonn), and Sweden (Karolinska University
Hospital, Stockholm). Participants were invited to attend a single study visit at the hospital,
during which standardised clinical assessments and biological sampling were conducted.

After obtaining informed consent and the confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, clinical
data were collected by a neurologist including: demographics (e.g. age, sex, ethnicity), vital
exams (e.g. blood pressure, electrocardiogram), personal and familial medical history, and
environmental

factor

exposure

history.

Additional

disease-specific

clinical

and

neuropsychological assessments were also performed. For the PD group (including controls)
these were: Movement Disorder Society-Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn &
Yahr stage, Schwab & England Activities of Daily Living (SE-ADL) scale, Non-Motor
Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), 39-item
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire
– Hong Kong (HK-RBD), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), University of Pennsylvania Smell
Identification Test (UPSIT) and Stand-walk-sit test. For the AD group (including controls)
these were: The 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Brain MRI, FCSRT-IR (Buschke) and
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Repeatable Battery
for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and environment questionnaire
including IPAQ were administered to subjects from both groups. Neuropsychological
assessments were performed during the visit by trained neuropsychologists. Clinical data
were collected in an electronic case report form (eCRF) using the REDCapTM system.6 The
eCRF was developed in collaboration with the Bioinformatics Core Facility of the Centre for
Systems Biomedicine (LCSB, University of Luxembourg, UL). All data and analyses
produced are stored in a project TranSMART database used and hosted by LCSB, UL and
managed by the ICM.
Biological samples
Blood samples were collected in the morning, in a fasted state, into: Serum Separating Tubes
(SST, serum collection) for serum, Lithium Heparin tubes (LH) for plasma, and EDTA tubes
for DNA extraction. Serum and plasma were frozen and stored at -80°C for biomarker
analysis (proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, genomics, epigenomics). EDTA plasma
samples were also snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (N2) and stored in N2 for the analysis of
neuroinflammation biomarkers. Cerebrospinal Fluid was collected by lumbar puncture.
Samples were centrifuged at 4°C within 1 hour, for 10 min at 2,000g and then progressively
frozen and stored at -80°C also for biomarker analysis (proteomics, metabolomics,
lipidomics). A subset of samples was snap-frozen immediately (within 60 seconds) and stored
in liquid N2 for the analysis of neuroinflammation biomarkers. Skin biopsies were also

proposed for fibroblast preparations frozen and stored in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
medium. Lumbar puncture and skin biopsy were optional for the participants.
Samples were collected, processed and stored locally in each site following the established
standard operating procedures. Samples were then distributed in different centres of the
Consortium for specific analyses: genomic analysis (ICM), epigenetics (UKB), proteomics
(KI), neuroinflammatory markers (UKB), lipidomics (UKB), AD markers (IDIBAPS), and
markers of autophagy and insulin resistance (SARD). Sample management procedures were
established prior to the start of the project and clinical centres were trained to ensure
standardised collection, preparation and transportation of the samples across countries. All the
remaining samples were finally centralised at the ICM biobank (Banque ADN et Cellules –
ICM).

Regulatory and ethical approvals
The sponsor of the study was the French institution Institut National de la Santé et de la
Recherche Médicale (INSERM). We took advantage of the European Clinical Research
Infrastructure Network (ECRIN) which took care of all regulatory approvals and applications,
under the responsibility of the sponsor, in other European countries, i.e. in Germany and
Sweden. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Boards (ERB) of the three
participating countries. The study was conducted in accordance with the standards set by
International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), and to
the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). The
protection of the confidentiality of records that could identify the included subjects is ensured
as defined by the EU Directive 2001/20/EC and the applicable national and international
requirements relating to data protection in each participating country.

Sample size calculation
The study was originally designed to recruit approximately 655 subjects in two disease groups
(PD and AD). This initial sample size was chosen to allow the identification of subgroups
with adequate precision, in accordance with our primary criteria. The primary objective aimed
at identifying subgroups of subjects that correspond to a hypothetic causative biological
pathway and corresponding to a particular biomarker. Depending on the hypothesis to be
validated, the size of the corresponding subgroup may be highly variable. For example, a
subgroup defined by genetics could represent only 2% of the total sample. By contrast, a

subgroup defined by non-omics markers may consist of 30% to 40% of the total population.
The sample size was calculated based upon the idea that we identify a subgroup in X% of the
population and we want to measure X% with a pre-defined precision (supplementary material,
Table S2). Sample-size was estimated using standard software (nQuery. Sample Size and
Power Calculation. “Statsols” (Statistical Solutions Ltd), Cork, Ireland) based upon the length
of a 95% confidence interval (CI) around the size of the sub-group being “shorter” or
“longer”. The shorter confidence interval means a more precise estimate and requires more
patients. For example, a subgroup consisting of 2.5% of the sample, such as may be found for
a subgroup defined by genetics, will have a “reasonable” 95% confidence limit of (1.3%,
3.7%) when 655 subjects are studied.

Statistical analysis
Key demographic, clinical, and disease severity variables are summarised in a descriptive
manner only. The intention is simply to provide an overview of the key information that have
been collected for each subgroup and to point out some of the main features of this data.
Statistical modelling is beyond the scope of this particular manuscript and formal statistical
comparisons of the groups are not included. Summary statistics of subject data at entry were
produced for each PD subgroup using PC SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and
the statistical tools within tranSMART. Due to the low subject numbers, summaries are not
provided for the AD patients, nor their controls. Continuous variables are described using
means and standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges where non-gaussian
distributions were suspected. Numbers and percentages are provided for each categorical
variable. Unless specified otherwise, percentage denominators are the number of non-missing
values.

Results
Enrolment of participants
A total of 421 subjects were screened for the study. Eight of these subjects were excluded
from the final dataset. The reasons for exclusion were: screen failure (n=3), participant
withdrawal upon investigator decision (n=2) and subject decision (n=3) (supplementary
material, Figure S1). One serious Adverse Event was reported that related to a study
procedure (a post-lumbar puncture syndrome with a complete recovery). All data from the
subject who experienced this SAE was included in the final analysis set. Overall, data from
413 subjects were available for analysis: 405 in the PD group and 8 in the AD group (Table
1). The study achieved its overall objective with respect to the PD group recruitment (412
screened vs. 415 planned, including controls), although the numbers of patients recruited with
Genetic PD subjects was fewer than desired (25 screened vs 40 planned). The “at risk PD”
subgroup included 25 subjects with idiopathic RBD and 14 with a first degree relative of a
genetic PD index case. Due to the early termination of AD recruitment, the number of AD
subjects is very small (n=8) and data from this group are not summarised in any further detail
in this manuscript. In total, nearly 1500 biological samples were collected (Table 2).
Biomarker analyses of these samples is currently being undertaken and will be presented in
subsequent AETIONOMY Consortium manuscripts.

Demographic and environmental characteristics
Demographic and other subject characteristics are summarised in Table 3. Data ascertainment
was extremely high for all the variables, as can be seen from the percentages in the final
column. PD patients and controls were well matched with respect to age, however close
gender matching was not achieved, with the Healthy Control group containing a much higher
proportion of females (66%) compared to both the PD and the At-Risk groups (maximum
44% female). The majority of subjects in each group were Caucasian/White (range: 76% in
Genetic PD to 98% Idiopathic PD).
Amongst the key environmental factors, rates of current smoking (a protective factor for PD)
were low (<13%) across all groups, with more than half of the PD patients having never
smoked. The proportion of those who consumed coffee was observed to be much lower in the
Genetic PD Group (48%) compared to all other groups where the rates were over 80%. As
expected, a history of head injury was most common in the Idiopathic PD group.

Clinical characteristics
Clinical characteristics, disease severity scores and medication use are summarised in Table
4. As expected, the majority (64%) of subject with Genetic PD and very few Idiopathic PD
subjects or controls (6% for each) reported a family history of PD. Over a third (40%) of the
At-Risk PD group also reported a family history of PD. Subjects with Genetic PD had a lower
average age at onset (45 compared to 61 years) and a much longer average disease duration
(144 compared to 28.5 months) compared with Idiopathic PD subjects.
Dopamine agonists were taken by approximately half of all PD patients and one At-Risk
subject (for restless leg syndrome); rates of Levodopa usage were slightly higher (~60%).
Consistent with a longer disease duration, the total average Levodopa Equivalent Daily Doses
was higher in Genetic PD as compared to Idiopathic PD; the difference being accounted for
by higher daily dosages of Levodopa in the Genetic PD group.
A consistent pattern was observed across a number of disease severity scales, such as MDSUPDRS III, SE-ADL, Hoehn and Yahr, HADS Depression Score and NMSS. Genetic PD
subjects tended to have the most severe scores, probably reflecting the longer average
duration of their disease, compared to Idiopathic PD subjects. The data from these scales also
highlighted that, whilst not as severely affected as the PD subjects, those At Risk of PD were
generally more severe than Healthy Controls. As an example, average MDS-UPDRS part III
scores were 45 (SD 18) in Genetic PD, 30 (SD 15) in Idiopathic PD, 10 (SD 5) in At Risk
subjects and 2 (SD 3) in Healthy Controls. Importantly, MDS-UPDRS part III was performed
in OFF-state to better represent the severity of the disease in treated patients. Finally, the
majority of the Genetic PD (72%) group, but only a few of the Idiopathic PD group (9-14%),
experienced Dyskinesia and Motor Fluctuations.
Average cognitive scores (MMSE, MOCA and RBANS) were very similar between groups.
Specifically, there was minimal difference between the At-Risk group and Healthy Controls.

Discussion
The potential for the utility of the large amount of data from multiple disparate sources
(literature, public, and private databases) to pave the way for a better classification of
patients, based on underlying causes instead of symptoms, was the core objective of the
AETIONOMY project. Achieving this goal goes far beyond the scope of any single company
or university; the key to success can only come from the broad nature of the project
consortium, which brings together expertise in neurodegenerative diseases, molecular
biology, clinical research, research ethics, data modelling and simulation, data standards, and
patient involvement in research.
The AETIONOMY team’s focus on systematically capturing and representing knowledge on
neurodegenerative diseases in a computable form to and the generation of a large inventory of
multiscale (ranging from the molecular level to the clinical level and cognitive readouts)
mechanistic hypotheses for AD and PD lays the foundations for clinical verification of these
models in an appropriate and clinically relevant cohort of patients. The role of the
AETIONOMY cross-sectional study in this context is therefore to support the validation of
novel patient classification criteria provided by these approaches.
We present here the design and the main clinical characteristics of a cross-sectional cohort of
subject which aim to represent the continuum of PD pathology. We believe that this clinical
dataset and its associated biological collection are suitable for an attempt to stratify the
disease according to its underlying mechanisms. As compared to cohorts recruiting only PD
patients, our population includes idiopathic and genetic forms of PD, early and late stage of
the disease, subject at the prodromal stage (idiopathic RBD) or at the preclinical stage (first
degree relatives of genetic PD) of the disease, and healthy controls. Only a few initiatives,
like the Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI),7 have collected in a standardised
manner clinical data and biological samples from all these subpopulations representing the
whole spectrum of the disease.
In our study, clinical assessments were carefully chosen to allow a comprehensive description
of the motor and the non-motor features of the disease. Demographic characteristics are very
similar to what has been described in previous studies in PD or prodromal PD,7-11 although
the age at onset is younger than in the general population, probably because patients were
recruited in expert centres. As expected, at-risk individuals presented average scores inbetween PD patients and healthy controls for most of the rating scales.12 An extensive
biological collection is associated with the AETIONOMY clinical dataset including DNA,

plasma, and serum for virtually all patients, CSF for 25% and fibroblasts derived from skin
biopsies for 39% of the subjects.
State of the art omics experiments and/or specific biomarker analyses are currently ongoing
by members of our Consortium in order to achieve the ambitious goal of stratifying PD
patients based on their underlying mechanisms. It is particularly difficult for
neurodegenerative diseases since no clear biomarkers have been found to be specifically
related to these mechanisms. Current and past exposure to environmental factors and
concomitant medication have been collected to adjust for potential confounding factors in
upcoming biomarker analyses.
Our study has some important limitations that must be highlighted. Our cohort was initially
designed to recruit patients across neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and AD patients.
We did not reach our goal in terms of recruitment of AD patients because a competitive
project IMI funded, the European Prevention of Alzheimer’s Dementia (EPAD) study, was
initiated soon after AETIONOMY started. The EPAD cohort will provide complementary
data to our cohort which mainly focuses on PD. Although subjects enrolled in our study
represent the continuum of PD from healthy controls to subject at risk, and PD patients,
AETIONOMY is a cross-sectional study. Future longitudinal prospective studies are needed
to investigate the progression of the disease, and determine the different trajectories according
to the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the sample size of our dataset remains relatively small
to perform unbiased analyses that require very large numbers of patients to correct for
multiple comparison testing. Findings from our analyses will thus require replication in
independent cohorts.
In conclusion, we provide here a new cohort for investigating the complex biology of
neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on PD. Beyond the specific objective of AETIONOMY,
we believe that this dataset is valuable for other research on biomarkers, patient stratification,
and PD mechanisms. Following the concept of open sciences, our Consortium has
implemented a process for data sharing, and the data as well as the samples will be made
available on request to the scientific community.

The Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient population of AETIONOMY Cross-Sectional Study was divided into three subgroups: Idiopathic PD
patients, Genetic PD patients and patients At Risk of PD. The Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patient population was composed of two subgroups:
Prodromal AD subjects and patients At Risk of AD.
Both of the PD and AD groups of patients were matched with healthy control populations.
