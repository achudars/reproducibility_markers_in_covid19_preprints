Abstract
Background: Pressure ulcer, one of the common challenging public health problems affecting
patient with spinal cord injury, is the formation of lesion and ulceration on the skin specially in
the bony prominence areas. It has a significant impact to the patient and health care system.
Moreover, it has psychological, physical, social burden and decrease the quality of life (QoL) of
patients. Despite its serious complications, limited evidence is available on the global magnitude
of pressure ulcers among patient with spinal cord injury. Hence, the objective of this systematic
review and meta-analysis was to estimate the global magnitude of pressure ulcers among patient
with spinal cord injury.
Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Africa journal online, PsycINFO and web-science
were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. The randomeffects model was fitted to estimate the summary effect. To investigate heterogeneity across the
included studies, I2 test was employed. Publication bias was examined using funnel plot and
Egger’s regression test statistic. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14
software for windows.
Results: Twenty-four studies which comprises of 600,078 participants were included in this
meta-analysis. The global pooled magnitude of pressure ulcer among patients with spinal cord
injury was 32.36% (95% CI (28.21, 36.51%)). Based on the subgroup analysis, the highest
magnitude of pressure ulcer was observed in Africa 41.19% (95% CI: 31.70, 52.18).
Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that about one in three patients
with spinal cord injury had pressure ulcers. This implies that the overall global magnitude of
pressure ulcer is relatively high. Therefore, policymakers (FMoH) and other concerned bodies
need give special attention to reduce the magnitude of pressure ulcers in patient with spinal cord
injury.

Background
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a life-threatening and debilitating injury with tremendous immediate
and long-term extensive impact on the medical, social, psychological and economic aspects of
clients, their caregivers and the society [1-3]. The annual incidence rate of SCI is 44 cases per 1
000 000 people in Tehran [4], and in European countries ranges from 5.5 to 195.4 cases per
million inhabitants [5]. Spinal cord injured patients have a high risk of developing pressure
ulcers due to motor and sensory impairments, immobility, changes in skin composition, and
prolonged hospital stay [6, 7]. PrUs are a serious, costly, and life-long complication of SCI.
Around, 30–40% of clients with spinal cord injuries develop pressure ulcers during the acute and
rehabilitation phases, most commonly over bony prominences[8].
Pressure ulcers and their treatment represent one of the most challenging clinical problems faced
by patients who are neurologically impaired or have chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) [9]. Even
though, there are different pressure ulcer classification systems, multiple sources of data, and
varying methods of obtaining data. According to the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel
(NPUAP) consensus development conference, pressure ulcers are classified according to severity
from suspected deep tissue injury through Unstageable, with suspected deep tissue injury
representing the earliest stage of pressure ulcer formation, and Unstageable is defined as “full
thickness tissue loss in which the base of the ulcer is covered by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green,
or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown, or black) in the wound bed”[10].
Pressure ulcers have a significant impact to the affected individual and on the health care system.
It highly affects the psychological, physical, social well-being and the quality of life of the
affected individuals [11-13]. Likewise, it lead to recurrent hospitalizations, multiple surgeries,
potentially devastating complications, morbidity and early mortality [9, 14, 15]. For example, a
study done in Canada revealed that the economic burden of pressure ulcer among spinal cord
injury was an average of $18,758 [3]. Pressure ulcer may account for 25% of the overall cost of
treating paraplegic and tetraplegic persons [16]. Moreover, a study done in Canada showed
average monthly cost per community dwelling SCI individual with a PU was $4745 [17].
The development of pressure ulcers (PUs) during hospitalization of patients with a spinal cord
injury (SCI) has been reported in different literature, which varying from 11% to 50% in the
current publications[6, 18]. Similarly, a study done in Switzerland reported that the incidence of

hospital acquired pressure ulcer was 2.31 per patient-year [18]. Poor pressure relief practices
lead to PU development in persons with SCI [10]. Management and care of pressure ulcer has
become a serious public health challenge, with longer hospital stays than for other causes.
Preventive measures to decrease the development of pressure ulcers consisted of basic skin care,
pressure dispersion using fenestrated foams and alternating weight-bearing sites by regular
frequent positioning and turning[7]. In addition, the key targets for interventions has been
advocated to reduce the burden of pressure ulcers in patient with SCI. These interventions
includes identification of risk factors, patient education, acute intensive care, and support body
surfaces [19].
The development of PUs is a very complex phenomenon and due to the presence of multiple risk
factors. Identifying risk factors used as benchmarks to design appropriate prevention measure, to
improve client safety and efficient utilization of resources. Several risk factors are responsible
for the development of pressure ulcers in patient with spinal cord injury. For instance, duration
after SCI( > 1 year) [20], age(older age), sex(being male) [20, 21], poor nutritional status
[22],quadriplegia[23-25],smoking[6, 26],comorbidity[23, 27], severe Braden scores[28],
weight(being underweight)[26], lower level of education[20, 21], and lack of an intimate partner
[21] were some of the risk factors associated with PU. Similarly, it has been reported that
patients with higher-level spinal cord injuries are more susceptible than those with lower-level
lesions [13].
Pressure ulcers among spinal cord injured client’s remains unrelenting problem and is a major
issue in nursing care across the globe. Prevention of pressure ulcers is one of the key components
of nursing care, and one of the quality indicator of nursing care at large [29]. Although most
previous studies have been conducted to assess the magnitude of pressure ulcer in acute care
setting, in intensive care unit, and on public hospitals, the global magnitude of pressure ulcers
among patient with spinal cord injury remains unknown. Hence, this study aimed to estimate the
global burden of pressure ulcers among spinal cord injured patients. Finding from the current
study would serve as benchmark for policy-makers to implement appropriate preventive measure
and to alleviate the pressing problem of pressure ulcer. In addition, for clinicians estimating
burden of pressure ulcer would reflect overall quality indicator for facilities and a way to assess
the efficiency of prevention strategies.

Methods
Search strategy and database
A two-step search strategy was used to identify all relevant literature. First, six electronic
databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Africa journal of online, Scopus, Web-science, and
PsycInfo were searched to extract all available literature. Second, a hand search of gray literature
and other related articles in order to identify additional relevant research. In addition, all
st

electronic sources of information were searched from 1st January/ 2000 to 1 July2, / 2019. The
search was conducted using the following MeSH and free-text terms: “pressure ulcer”, “pressure
injury”, “decubitus ulcer”, “spinal cord injury”, and "prevalence”. Boolean operators like “AND”
and “OR” were used to combine search terms.

Eligibility criteria
Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) All observational studies, which
reported the prevalence pressure ulcer among spinal cord injured clients;(2) articles published in
peer reviewed journals and gray literature:(3) published in the English language between 2000 to
2019; (4) we imposed no restriction on the area where it is conducted; and (5) the group of
patients admitted without PUs. Studies were excluded on any one of the following conditions:
(1) Patients admitted with pressure ulcer;( 2) studies with poor quality score as per stated criteria;
and (3) articles in which fail to determine the outcome (pressure ulcer).

Selection and quality assessment
Data were extracted by three authors using a pre-piloted and standardized data extraction format
prepared in a Microsoft excel. Data extracted from articles included authors name, year of
publication, study area, study design, sample size, prevalence and data collection methods. The
quality of each included study was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale [30]. Studies were
included in the analysis if they scored ≥7 out of 9 points in three domains of the equally
weighted modified NOS components for cohort studies and for cross-sectional studies quality
assessment tool, score of ≥5 out of 10 considered as high quality score. Finally, the quality score
of each study were extracted from each incorporated article by three independent authors. Any
disagreements at the time of data abstraction were resolved by discussion and consensus.

cohort studies using modified Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Statistical analysis
To obtain the pooled effect size, a meta-analysis using weighted inverse variance random-effects
model was performed. Heterogeneity across the included studies was checked using the I2
statistics test[31]. In addition, to investigate the possible sources of heterogeneity, metaregression analysis was deployed. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of a funnel
plot. Similarly, Egger was conducted and a p≤ 0.05was considered statistically significant
for the presence of publication bias [32, 33]. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was performed to
investigate whether the pooled effect size was influenced by individual studies. The data were
analysed using STATA version 14 statistical software[34].

Data synthesis and reporting
We analysed the data to estimate the pooled magnitude of pressure ulcers among spinal cord
injured clients. Results were presented using forest plots. Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed to report our
results[35]. (Supplementary file 2-PRISMA checklist) and, it is not registered in the Prospero
database.

Result
Search results
We found that a total of 1,053 articles, of these, 1,027 studies were found from six international
databases and the remaining 26 were through manual search. Databases includes; PubMed (611),
Scopus (171), PsycInfo (10), Google scholar (76), Web-science (92), and Africa online journal
(67). Out of them, 529 duplicate records were identified and removed. From the remaining 524
articles, 407 articles were excluded after reading of titles and abstracts based on the pre-defined
eligible criteria. Finally, 117 full text articles were assessed for eligibility criteria. Based on the
pre-defined criteria and quality assessment, only 24 articles were included for the final analysis
(Figure 1).

Meta- regression analysis
To investigate the possible source of variation across the included studies, we have performed
meta-regression by using publication year, and sample size as covariate of interest. However, the
result of the meta-regression analysis showed that both covariates were not statistically
significant for the presence of heterogeneity (Table 2).

To identify the presence of publication bias, funnel plot, and egger’s test was performed. The
visual inspection of the funnel plots showed asymmetrical distribution, which is the evidence for
publication bias (Figure 5). However, asymmetry of the funnel plot was not statistically

Sensitivity analysis
We have also conducted sensitivity analysis, to evaluate the effect of individual study on the
pooled effect size. The finding of sensitivity analyses using random effects model revealed that
no single study affect the overall magnitude of pressure ulcer (figure 6).

Discussion
This study aimed to synthesis evidence on the magnitude of pressure ulcer among spinal cord
injured patients. This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive estimation of the global pooled
prevalence of pressure ulcer. In line with the objective, the present study found that the overall
prevalence of pressure ulcer among spinal cord injured patient was 32.36% (95% CI: 28.21,
36.51%). This finding is much higher than a meta-analysis study done on the global prevalence
of pressure ulcer in public hospitals 14.8% [53]. This showed that there is a high magnitude of

pressure ulcer among patients with spinal cord injury, which indicates inadequate prevention and
management of pressure ulcer risk factors.
The result of the subgroup analysis based on study design (cross-sectional vs cohort) showed that
the highest pooled prevalence of pressure ulcers was observed from studies done with cohort
design 34.85% (95%CI: 28.50, 41.19). This variation might be in case of cohort study design the
outcome variable was obtained through observation, skin assessment, physical examination and
with certain follow up time whereas in cross-sectional studies data were collected with document
review and self-report. Therefore, these situations may contribute for variation across study
designs. Similarly, we had performed subgroup analysis based on continent, the highest
magnitude of pressure ulcer reported in Africa 41.94%, followed by Europe 37.47%. The
possible explanations for this variation might be due methodological differences, variation in
quality of care, policy and strategy difference[9, 54].
This meta-analysis has implication for clinical practice. Estimating the burden of pressure ulcers
provide current evidence to establishing robust preventive measures, to improve patient safety, to
minimize treatment cost and to design appropriate treatment strategy for pressure ulcer patients
with spinal cord injury. In addition, the finding serves as alarming to health care professional to
give a focus on the application of standardized care and represents a marker of quality of care.
Although this meta-analysis conducted with the use of comprehensive search strategy to
incorporate the studies across a globe and all the included studies were observational study, there
are some limitations that need to be considered in the future research: First, only English articles
were considered; Second, this study do not identify the predictors of pressure ulcers among
patients with spinal cord injury; Third, all included studies were reported hospital-based data.

Conclusion and recommendations
This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that about one in three patients with spinal
cord injury had pressure ulcers. This implies that the overall global magnitude of pressure ulcer
is relatively high. Therefore, policymakers (FMoH) and other concerned bodies need to give
special attention to improve health care delivery for patient with spinal cord injury and reduce
the risk of ulceration. Situation based interventions and country context specific effective
preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the burden of pressure ulcers among patients

Furthermore, further research is needed to identify associated factors for the development of
pressure ulcers among patient with spinal cord injury.
