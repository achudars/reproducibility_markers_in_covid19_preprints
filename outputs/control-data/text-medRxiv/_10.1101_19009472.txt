CIMT and AOT in unilateral cerebral palsy

Abstract
Introduction. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) improves upper limb (UL)
motor execution in unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). As these children also show motor
planning deficits, action-observation training (AOT) might be of additional value. Here, we
investigated the combined effect of AOT to CIMT and identified factors influencing
treatment response.
Methods. Forty-four children with uCP (mean 9y6m, SD 1y10m) participated in a 9-day
camp wearing a splint for 6 hours/day and were allocated to the CIMT+AOT (n=22) and the
CIMT+placebo group (n=22). The CIMT+AOT group received 15 hours of AOT (i.e. videoobservation) and executed the observed tasks, whilst the CIMT+AOT group watched videos
free of biological motion and executed the same tasks. The primary outcome measure was
bimanual performance. Secondary outcomes included measures at body function and activity
level assessed before (T1), after (T2) the intervention, and at 6 months follow-up (T3).
Influencing factors included behavioural and neurological characteristics.
Results. Although no between-groups differences were found (p>0.05), the addition of AOT
led to higher gains in children with initially poorer bimanual performance (p=0.02). Both
groups improved in all outcome measures after the intervention and retained the gains at
follow up (p<0.01). Poor sensory function resulted in larger improvements in the total group
(p=0.03) and high amount of mirror movements tended to result in better response to the
additional AOT training (p=0.06). Improvements were similar irrespective of the type of
brain lesion or corticospinal tract wiring pattern.
Conclusions. Adding AOT to CIMT, resulted in better outcome for children with poor motor
function and high amount of mirror movements. CIMT with or without AOT seems to be
more beneficial for children with poor sensory function.

CIMT and AOT in unilateral cerebral palsy

1. Introduction
The quality of life of children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP) can be compromised by
their upper limb (UL) sensorimotor problems [1,2]. In the last decades, improving these
deficits has been the focus of many studies. Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)
is one of the few treatments that has been thoroughly investigated and proven to be effective
[3]. It consists of constraining the less impaired hand while intensively training the more
impaired UL to promote increased use of the latter [4,5]. Whilst CIMT focuses on improving
UL movement quality and efficiency, children with uCP also show deficits in motor
representation and motor planning [6,7]. To overcome these deficits, Action-Observation
Training (AOT) has been suggested as a potential treatment modality. AOT is based on the
well-established principle that observation of actions activates the same cortical structures
that are active during the actual performance of the task [8]. Although preliminary evidence
has shown positive effects of AOT on UL function in children with uCP [9–13], it remains
unknown whether the combination of CIMT and AOT would enhance the effect of CIMT on
improving UL sensorimotor function in these children.
Despite increasing evidence proving the effectiveness of CIMT, the large variability in
reported results leads to overall small to medium effect sizes [14,15]. Therefore, identifying
factors influencing treatment response would contribute to the development of more efficient
and more individualized treatment planning. Poor initial hand function has influenced a better
response to CIMT in previous studies [16,17], but there remains controversy regarding age
[16–18]. In adult stroke survivors, there is preliminary evidence that sensory deficits may
also influenced UL motor outcome [19,20]. We hypothesize that children with impaired
sensory function might also benefit more from the intensive use of their more impaired hand.
Similarly, mirror movements have a negative impact on UL function [21–23], yet their value
to influence treatment response remains unknown. Among potential neurological factors are
the underlying lesion type (predominantly white matter vs. grey matter damage) and the
corticospinal tract (CST) wiring pattern, due to their value in explaining variability in UL
function [24–26]. Thus far, only one small study showed improvements after CIMT
regardless of the lesion type [27]. However, there is controversy regarding the influence of
the CST wiring pattern on treatment response [27–29]. Some studies have reported a worse
outcome after CIMT in children with an ipsilateral CST wiring [28–30] whilst others showed
positive outcome irrespective of the CST wiring pattern [27]. Nevertheless, these studies had
small sample sizes and did not include children with different lesion types.

CIMT and AOT in unilateral cerebral palsy

The aim of this study is twofold: we first investigated the added value of AOT to CIMT in
improving UL sensorimotor function in children with uCP; and secondly, we explored the
influence of behavioural and neurological factors treatment response.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
This randomized, evaluator-blinded, controlled clinical trial has been fully described
elsewhere [31], and will be briefly summarized here. The study was conducted at KU Leuven
and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospitals Leuven (S56513) and
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT03256357). All children agreed to
participate, and their parents or caregivers signed the informed consent.
2.2. Study population and randomization
Children with uCP were recruited between June 2014 and June 2017 via the CP reference
centre of the University Hospitals Leuven. Inclusion criteria were (1) confirmed diagnosis of
uCP, (2) aged 6-12 years, (3) sufficient cooperation to complete the activities and
assessments, and (4) minimal ability to actively grasp and stabilize an object with the more
impaired hand (House Functional Classification Score (HFC) ≥ 4 [32]). Children were
excluded in case of UL surgery in the last 2 years, or botulinum toxin A-injections 6 months
prior to enrolment. The participants were stratified according to the HFC scale (4–5 vs. 6–7),
age (6-9y vs. 10–12 y), and the CST wiring pattern (contralateral, bilateral, ipsilateral) and
assigned to the CIMT+AOT or CIMT+placebo AOT group by using a permuted block design
of two. Randomization was performed by a researcher independent of the recruitment and
evaluation sessions (HF).
2.3. Intervention
The intervention was delivered in a day camp model during 9 out of 11 consecutive days (6
hours/day, total of 54 hours of therapy). During the camp, all children wore a tailor-made
hand splint on the less impaired hand while performing unimanual exercises during
individual therapy (9h), group activities (30h), and AOT/placebo condition (15h).
The individual therapy was based on motor learning principles of shaping and repetitive
practice by focusing on four goals: (1) active wrist and elbow extension, (2) forearm
supination, (3) grip strength, and (4) fine motor tasks. The group activities consisted of

painting, crafting, cooking, and outdoor playing, selected to stimulate the intensive use of the
more impaired hand. Children assigned to the CIMT+AOT group received 15 hours of AOT
sessions. During these sessions, children watched video sequences showing unimanual goaldirected actions, adapted to the child’s functional level (Additional files of [31]). The
CIMT+placebo group watched video games free of human motion. Afterwards, they executed
the same actions for 3 minutes in the same order as the experimental group, for which only
verbal, non-suggestive instructions were provided. To account for the compliance of the
video observation in the experimental group, a yes/no question related to each video activity
was asked after the second execution of each activity (e.g. is the box taken from the top? Did
you see the palm of the hand?). At the end of the intervention, the number of correct answers
were summed, ranging from 0 (all answers incorrect) to 45 (all answers correct).
2.4. Evaluation
An experienced physiotherapist blinded to group allocation (JH) conducted the evaluations at
T0 (baseline, 3-4 months before the intervention), T1 (within 4 days before the intervention),
T2 (within 4 days after the intervention), and T3 (6 months after the intervention). At T0, we
collected descriptive and clinical characteristics to individually set the child’s therapy goals
by experienced physiotherapists. Primary and secondary outcome measures were collected at
T1, T2, and T3. At T1, we evaluated sensory function, mirror movements, type of brain
lesion, and CST wiring pattern as influencing factors.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), which evaluates
the spontaneous use of the impaired hand during bimanual activities [33,34]. A certified rater
scored the videos, blinded to group-allocation and time-point evaluation. The smallest
detectable difference is 5 AHA units [35].
Secondary outcome measures comprised body function and activity measures, following a
valid and reliable protocol [36]. At body function level, we measured muscle tone, muscle
strength, and grip strength. Muscle tone was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale
(MAS [37]) for the shoulder (adductors and internal rotators), elbow (flexors and pronators),
wrist (flexors), and hand (finger flexors and thumb adductors) with a total score ranging 0-28.
Muscle strength of the shoulder (flexors, adductors, and abductors), elbow (flexors,
extensors, supinators, and pronators), and wrist (flexors and extensors) was evaluated using

the 8-point ordinal scale of the Medical Research Council [38] with a total score ranging 045. Grip strength was assessed using the mean of three maximum contractions with the
Jamar® dynamometer (Sammons Preston, Rolyan, Bolingbrook, IL, USA). Movement quality
was evaluated with the Melbourne Assessment 2 (MA2) [39,40], resulting in percentages of
four subscales measuring range of motion, accuracy, dexterity, and fluency. The test was
scored afterwards by a trained physiotherapist blinded to group-allocation and time-point
evaluation.
At activity level, we included unimanual movement speed and unimanual and bimanual
dexterity. Movement speed (time) was evaluated during six unimanual tasks with the
modified version of the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) [41,42]. The smallest
detectable difference for the more affected hand is 70 seconds [43]. Unimanual and bimanual
dexterity were evaluated using the Tyneside Pegboard Test, an instrumented 9-hole pegboard
test [44]. In the unimanual condition, the child moves the pegs as fast as possible from one
board to the other, in both directions, using first the less impaired hand. In the bimanual
condition, also in both directions, one hand picks up the pegs, transfers them to the other
hand through a hole in a Perspex divider placed between the boards, and the other hand
inserts the pegs. The test is electronically timed, and results are outputted using a customwritten software (Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne,
United Kingdom).
Parents were asked to complete the ABILHAND-Kids and the Children’s Hand-use
Experience Questionnaire (CHEQ). The ABILHAND-Kids reliably measures the difficulty
experienced by the child in performing 21 daily activities [45]. The CHEQ reliably captures
the parent’s perspective of the child’s experience while using the more impaired hand during
29 bimanual activities, resulting in three subscales measuring grip efficacy, time used
compared to peers, and experience of feeling bothered [46,47].
Influencing factors of treatment response
Sensory assessments comprised measures of exteroception (tactile sense), proprioception
(movement sense), two-point discrimination (2PD, Aesthesiometer®) and stereognosis
(tactile object identification), which have been shown to be reliable in this population [36].
Tactile and movement sense were classified as normal (score 2), impaired (score 1) or absent
(score 0). 2PD was classified according to the minimum width between the two points that
the children could discriminate: normal (0-4mm, score 2), or impaired (>4mm, score 1) [48].

CIMT and AOT in unilateral cerebral palsy

Tactile object identification was quantified as the number of objects that the child could
recognize (0-6). In addition, a kit of 20 nylon monofilaments (0.04g - 300g) (Jamar®
Monofilaments, Sammons Preston, Rolyan, Bolingbrook, IL, USA) was used to reliably
determine threshold values for touch sensation [49,50]. Touch sensation was categorized as
normal (0.008-0.07g), diminished light touch (0.16-0.4g), diminished protective sensation
(0.6-2g), loss of protective sensation (4.19-180g) and untestable (300g), according to the
manual.
Mirror movements (MM) were quantitatively assessed with the GriFT device during a
squeezing task, following the protocol defined by Jaspers et al (2018) [51]. Before
performing the task, we tested the maximum voluntary contraction of each hand, starting with
the less affected hand. We instructed the children to play a game requiring rhythmic
squeezing of one handle with one hand (active hand), while holding the second handle with
the other hand (passive hand). The game consisted of controlling with the active hand the
position of an astronaut (higher forces corresponding to a higher position on the screen), with
the goal to jump over meteorites flying across the screen. MM characterization was based on
the comparison of grip force profiles of the active vs. the passive hand, and consisted of the
calculation of MM amplitude. MM frequency represents the number of squeezes in the
passive hand that exceeded a predefined threshold, expressed as a percentage of the total
number of squeezes produced in the active hand. MM amplitude is the average amplitude
ratio of the squeezes between both hands, based on only those squeezes in the passive hand
that exceeded a predefined threshold. Lastly, MM amount was computed as the frequency by
amplitude product, providing an overall indication of the MM occurrence. Full details on the
calculation can be found in [51]. MM amount in each hand was used for further statistical
analysis.
Brain imaging and neurophysiology.
The MRI was acquired with a 3T system (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The
Netherlands) equipped with a 32 channels coil. Structural images were acquired using threedimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR) and magnetization prepared
rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE). MRI results were used to characterize the lesion type
according to the presumed timing (malformation, predominantly white matter, predominantly
grey matter) [52] by a child neurologist (EO). To identify the underlying CST wiring pattern,
a single-pulse TMS session was conducted. A MagStim 200 Stimulator (Magstim Ltd.,

Whitland, Wales, UK) equipped with a focal 70mm figure-eight coil and a Bagnoli
electromyography system (Delsys Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was used for data acquisition.
After identifying the hotspot and the rest motor thresholds, motor evoked potentials were
elicited and recorded on the thumb adductor and opponent muscles on both hands, to identify
the wiring pattern (contralateral, bilateral or ipsilateral). Children with contraindications to
MRI or Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) did not undergo the respective
measurement. There were no adverse events.
2.5. Statistical analyses
Effect of the intervention over time
Normality was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test and inspection of the histograms for
symmetry. To conduct parametric statistics, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the
parameters of grip strength, the JTHFT, the instrumented pegboard test, the ‘range of motion’
subscale of the MA2, and the ‘feeling bothered’ subscale of the CHEQ questionnaire. A
reflect and square root transformation was applied to the ‘accuracy’ subscale of the MA2.
Descriptive statistics were reported according to the nature of the data (i.e. means and
standard deviations for continuous data and median and interquartile ranges for ordinal data).
Mixed models were used to study changes after the intervention over time. By using random
effects, these models can correct for the dependency among repeated observations.
Furthermore, these models deal with missing data offering valid inferences, assuming that
missing observations are unrelated to unobserved outcomes [52]. Changes over time between
groups were tested by including group*time interactions. In case of a significant interaction,
group-dependent changes were investigated separately in each group. Significant time trends
were further inspected using pairwise post-hoc comparisons between T1-T2, T1-T3, and T2T3 (Bonferroni corrected). The effect sizes of these comparisons were calculated and
interpreted according to Cohen’s d formula (small, 0.2–0.5; medium, 0.5–0.8, and large>0.8)
[53].
Influencing factors of treatment response
Both behavioural (age, initial motor function based on AHA and JTHFT score at T1, sensory
function, and MM amount) and neurological characteristics (type of brain lesion and CST
wiring pattern) were evaluated as potential influencing factors of treatment response. All
variables were included in their original scale except for a dichotomized score for initial
motor function. Initial low motor function was defined as either <50 in the AHA units or

>350 seconds in the JTHFT (defined as the 25th percentiles for the total group at T1). These
variables were included as covariates in the models to influence outcome in the AHA
(bimanual) and JTHFT (unimanual), together with the time*group interaction. If the
interaction with group was not significant, the interaction with time was examined. Post-hoc
analyses with Bonferroni correction were conducted in case of significant interactions and
trends (<0.10), as this would allow us to capture tendencies immediately after the
intervention.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows version 25.0 (IBM
Corp. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The two-sided 5% level of significance was used for
interactions and main effects.
3. Results
3.1. Participants
Forty-four children participated in the study (mean age (SD) 9y6m (1y10m); 27 boys; 23 leftsided uCP; 9 Manual Ability Classification System I (MACS, [54]), 15 MACS II, and 20
MACS III), and were allocated to the CIMT+AOT group (n=22) and CIMT+placebo group
(n=22) (Table 1; Supporting information Table S1). All children completed the intervention
program (100% compliance), but two allocated to the CIMT+placebo group were lost to
follow-up (Figure 1).
3.1. Treatment efficacy
Table 2 summarizes the outcome measures for each intervention group at every time point.
All children who received AOT sessions showed a good compliance to the video observation,
based on the number of correct answers to the video-related questions (median=42,
interquartile range=5, range 30-45). No differences in hand function between groups were
found at T1 (all p>0.05, Table S2 Supporting information).
The added value of AOT to CIMT
We did not find between-groups differences in improvements over time on the primary
outcome (AHA; p>0.05) nor on the secondary outcomes (all p>0.05, Table 2).

Improvements over time
Primary outcome
The descriptive data is shown in Table S3 of Supporting information. The total group
improved over time in the AHA (p<0.001), with a significant mean improvement of 2.21
AHA units immediately after the intervention (T1-T2, p<0.001) and maintained at follow-up
(T2-T3, p<0.001). Effect sizes were low (ES=0.14-0.18). Immediately after the intervention,
most of the children (n=32, 74%) improved their AHA score, of which 28% (n=9) showed an
improvement ≥ 5 AHA units (Figure 2A).

CIMT and AOT in unilateral cerebral palsy

[Insert Figure 2]

Secondary outcomes
At body function level, we found an improvement in grip and muscle strength (p<0.001),
occurring immediately after the intervention (p<0.001) and maintained at follow-up
(p<0.001). From the MA2 scale, only range of motion improved over time (p=0.04), although
the improvements were not immediately after the camp (p>0.05), but at follow-up (p=0.04).
No significant changes were found for spasticity scores (p>0.05).
At activity level, we found large improvements in movement speed (JTHFT, p<0.001),
performing on average 43 seconds faster after the intervention (p<0.001) and retaining the
gains at follow-up (p<0.001). After the intervention, 88% of the children (n=37) improved,
and 32% (n=14) improved more than the smallest detectable difference (70 seconds) (Figure
1B) of which 70% (n=31) maintained these gains at follow-up. The improvements were also
large in unimanual and bimanual dexterity (pegboard test, all p<0.02). Unimanual dexterity
improved immediately after the intervention (p<0.01) and improvements were retained at
follow-up (p<0.05). The ‘small pegs’ condition was incomplete for 8 children before the
camp, although 6 of these 8 children could complete the task after the camp, and 4 of them
still completed it at follow-up. Bimanual dexterity also improved immediately after the
intervention (p<0.01) and at follow-up (p<0.01). Lastly, the CHEQ results showed a
reduction in time consumption and feeling bothered while performing activities (p=0.009 and
p=0.04, respectively), increasing by 4.47% (T1 vs. T2, p=0.008) and 5.96% (T1 vs. T2,
p=0.03), respectively. ABILHAND-Kids did not change after the intervention (p=0.65).
In summary, we found improvements after the intervention on muscle strength (ES 0.93) and
grip strength (ES 0.16), on unimanual dexterity measured with the JTHFT (ES 5.81) and in
unimanual (ES 0.65-1.57) and bimanual dexterity (ES 0.85-1.44) measured with the
instrumented pegboard test. Lastly, the subscales of the CHEQ ‘feeling bothered’ and ‘time
used’ improved with large (ES 0.85) and small (ES 0.31) effect size, respectively.
Additionally, the retained gains were also captured by these assessments with similar ES.
3.2. Influencing factors
We evaluated the influence of behavioural and neurological characteristics on treatment
outcome for the primary outcome measure (AHA) and for movement speed (JTHFT), as it

between T1-T2 (p=0.02). This interaction indicated that if the initial AHA score was low, the
CIMT+AOT group benefitted more than the CIMT+placebo group. If the initial AHA score
was high, both groups improved equally (Figure 3B).
Similarly, we found a trend toward a significant influence of MM amount in the less
affected hand (more affected hand actively moving) on treatment response of bimanual
performance (F=3.21, p=0.06, Figure 4). This interaction indicated that if the initial amount
of MM was high, the CIMT+AOT group benefitted more than the CIMT+placebo group. If
the initial MM amount was low, both groups improved similarly.
Responsiveness to AOT did not depend on age nor sensory function for either AHA or
JTHFT (p>0.05). Regarding neurological characteristics, neither type of brain lesion nor CST
wiring pattern had an influence on responsiveness to AOT (p>0.05).

[Insert Figure 3]

[Insert Figure 4]

Are there subgroups of children who respond better to CIMT with or without AOT?
We found that sensory function was able to influence treatment response for the total group
for unimanual dexterity. More specifically, exteroception, 2PD, and touch sensation
influenced the outcome of the JTHFT (p=0.03-0.08; Table 3), indicating that children with
more impaired sensory function benefitted more from the CIMT intervention, compared to
those with normal sensory function (Figure 4). Note that initial motor function did not
interfere with these interactions (interaction term p<0.05).
The responsiveness to CIMT with or without AOT did not depend on age, initial motor
function, stereognosis, nor amount of MM (p>0.05, Table 3). Similarly, neither type of brain
lesion nor CST wiring pattern had an influence on responsiveness to CIMT with or without
AOT when tested individually (p>0.05, Figure 6) or combined (interaction between CST
wiring pattern and type of the brain lesion, p>0.05).

CIMT and AOT in unilateral cerebral palsy

4. Discussion
This randomized controlled trial was the first to investigate the effects of an intensive campbased treatment model combining CIMT and AOT to improve UL function at body function
and activity level, by including clinical and instrumented outcome measures, as well as both
behavioural and neurological factors to determine their influence on treatment outcome. The
effects showed that, with or without AOT, an intensive CIMT training approach delivered in
a summer camp setting leads to improvements in UL function. Although we could not
demonstrate an overall added effect of AOT, our results suggest that the addition of AOT to
CIMT may be beneficial for children with initial poor hand function and high amount of
MM. In addition, we found that sensory function influenced treatment response following
CIMT (with or without AOT).
What is the added value of AOT to CIMT on UL function?
The novelty of this RCT lies in the investigation of the added value of AOT to a wellestablished therapy approach, such as CIMT. Overall, our results show similar improvements
in the CIMT+AOT and CIMT+placebo group. To date, the first studies exploring AOT in
children with uCP have proven its effectiveness in improving UL motor function [9–12].
However, these studies investigated the effect of AOT alone compared to a placebo or no
observation, and not the added effect of AOT to a well-established UL therapy, such as
CIMT. Our results are in agreement to Kirkpatrick et al (2016), who found no effect of AOT
compared to repetitive practice in a home setting [13]. In our study, the lack of additional
value of AOT could be explained by the large gains after CIMT reported in current and
previous studies [14,55,56].
Interestingly, we identified that children with initial poorer hand function (lower than 50
AHA units) benefitted more from the combined approach CIMT+AOT compared to CIMT
alone. On average, the group receiving CIMT+AOT with initially poorer AHA scores
improved 4 AHA units, while the CIMT+placebo group did not improve. Sgandurra et al
(2018) recently reported that poorer bimanual performance, measured with the AHA, was
indicative for a more lateralized mirror neuron system in children with uCP (toward the nonlesioned hemisphere) [57]. Given these results, it makes sense that the additional AOT

CIMT and AOT in unilateral cerebral palsy

intervention for children who had poorer bimanual performance was more effective, as AOT
may have facilitated the activation of their mirror neuron system through the videoobservation. For those children who showed high bimanual performance, it seems plausible
that the mirror neuron system cannot be further facilitated, as this may be intact, and other
sensorimotor brain regions would need to be stimulated to further increase their motor
function, for example to facilitate inter-hemisphere connectivity. Also, in contrast to other
studies, the current study only included unimanual tasks to fit the unimanual concept of
CIMT, although more challenging bimanual AOT tasks may be needed to further improve
UL function in children with initially better hand function. While this finding is clinically
relevant, further studies are clearly needed to confirm our results, as well as to define the best
delivery of AOT.
A second significant influencing factor of treatment outcome between groups following the
intervention was amount of MM in the less affected hand. Whilst children with few MM
responded similarly to either training, children with high amount of MM in the less affected
hand seemed to improve more after the CIMT+AOT training. There is evidence for a relation
between poor bimanual function and high amount of MM [21]. Thus, this result is in line
with the previous result, where poor hand function influenced treatment outcome.
Unfortunately, we cannot be certain that these changes are not led by concomitant reduction
in amount of MM. Additional studies including an evaluation of MM before and after
intervention are needed to further clarify these relationships. Nevertheless, this novel finding
points toward the importance of measuring MM and it is a first step toward the delineation of
training strategies based on clinical characteristics.
What are the effects of CIMT (with or without AOT) on UL function?
Our results for the total group showed improvements in grip and muscle strength (ES 0.160.93), JTHFT (ES 5.81) and the instrumented pegboard test (ES 0.65-1.57), indicated by their
large effect sizes. Moreover, the gains in muscle strength and unimanual dexterity were
translated to bimanual dexterity, measured with the bimanual conditions of the instrumented
pegboard test (ES 0.65-1.44). Interestingly, these gains also resulted in an increased comfort
in using the hand in daily activities as confirmed by the improvement in the CHEQ-subscale
‘feeling bothered’ with large effect size (0.85). Still, this contrasts with the small effect size
found for the AHA (0.18). The effect size of the AHA reported in previous CIMT studies in a
camp model varies across studies: larger effect sizes (around 1.12) in younger children (18m-

8y) [58,59], smaller effects (0.16-0.28) in children aged similar to our study [27,60,61].
According to Hung et al (2011), the AHA measures the quality of the assisting hand while
performing bimanual movements and misses the spatiotemporal control of bimanual
functioning [62]. Integrating other measures of spatiotemporal control may help to capture
these aspects.
In most measures, we found that the improvements were not only seen immediately after the
therapy, but also after 6 months, which is in agreement with previous studies
[18,27,42,60,61]. This maintenance is of clinical relevance, as intensive therapies are given in
shorter periods. Charles et al (2007) showed, however, that between 6 months and 1 year
after the first camp, children typically showed a slight functional decline, and a second CIMT
dose 1 year after resulted in continued improvements [63]. Boosts of intensive interventions
with 6-months or 1-year interval may result in long-lasting and clinically relevant effects.
Interestingly, we also found that children with impaired sensory function benefitted more
from the intervention compared to children with normal sensory function. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that sensory function is investigated as an influencing factor
of response to CIMT in children with uCP. The sensory deficits may lead to a failure to use
the motor functions and capacities of the more affected UL for spontaneous use in daily life.
This phenomenon is known as developmental disregard [64,65]. It is hypothesized that
children with developmental disregard may respond better to CIMT due to the forced use of
the more affected limb. The positive effects are however partially lost at follow-up,
potentially due to the lack of ongoing stimulation of the more affected limb,
Does the response to CIMT depend on the underlying neurological characteristics?
In our study, we found that all children improved after a CIMT program, irrespective of their
lesion type or CST wiring pattern. Interestingly, and adding to the controversy in the
literature [27–30], having an ipsilateral CST wiring pattern did not impede improvement after
treatment, as these children improved almost 5 AHA units after CIMT (with or without AOT)
(see Figure 6). Staudt et al (2014) proposed that one neurological factor is insufficient to
impact treatment response after CIMT [66], and a multifactorial model including several
neurological characteristics may have larger influence than any factor alone. Nevertheless,
our study did not find that the interaction between the lesion type and the CST wiring pattern
had a larger influence on treatment outcome. Our study results highlight the variability within

each group, suggesting the influence of other factors. We hypothesize that functional
measures of both sensory and motor function, and how these functions are integrated in the
brain (sensorimotor integration) may be an important influencing factor of treatment
outcome. Further investigations including both clinical and neurophysiological measures of
the motor and sensory system (motor and sensory evoked potentials), as well as of
sensorimotor integration (e.g. with the short latency afferent inhibition protocol [67]) are
warranted.
Whilst this study was the first to investigate the merit of AOT in combination with CIMT in a
camp model, its limitations should also be addressed. Firstly, we included 44 children
according to the power calculation for the primary outcome measure [31]. This sample size
could be too low when investigating influencing factors of treatment response, particularly
for the neurological characteristics. A second limitation is the lack of a specific outcome
measure that evaluates motor planning as targeted with the AOT [11]. Future studies
investigating the added effect of AOT should also include such outcome measures, for
example the end-posture comfort [68,69]. Lastly, it remains debatable whether a two-week
camp can be translated to routine clinical practice, as it demands high commitment from both
the parents and the children during the holiday period. In our study, despite a good
cooperation during the AOT intervention, the children generally reported that the AOT
sessions were monotonous. Hence, we advocate for trainings that are engaging and
motivating for the children. For example, a virtual reality environment [70,71] where the
child sees himself as an avatar, could serve as a more motivating, engaging, and potentially
more effective AOT approach.
In the future, it is crucial that forces between centres and institutions are joined to coordinate
multicentre RCTs, which will contribute to fine-tune the identification of responders vs. nonresponders through clinical and neurological predictors in a statistically powerful study.
Furthermore, future studies should investigate the neuroplastic changes derived from an
intensive intervention.
Conclusion
AOT did not show an overall added effect on improving UL function in children with uCP
when combined with CIMT in an intensive training approach. Still, AOT seemed to have an
additional positive value in children with poor motor function and high amount of MM,

suggesting that the responsiveness to AOT is patient specific. Such insights provide a further
step toward patient-tailored intervention approaches. The findings of this study also confirm
the efficacy of intensive models of CIMT interventions (with or without AOT), with large
effect sizes found in unimanual and bimanual dexterity, which seems to be more beneficial
for children with impaired sensory function. The novelty of this study lies within the
exploration of behavioural and neurological influencing factors on treatment response, which
