Abstract

55

Rationale

56

Severe early-life respiratory illnesses, particularly those caused by respiratory syncytial

57

virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), are strongly associated with the development

58

of asthma in children. Puerto Rican children in particular have a strikingly high asthma

59

burden, but prior studies of the potential associations between early-life respiratory

60

illnesses and asthma in Puerto Rican and other minority populations have been limited.

61

Objectives

62

We sought to determine whether early-life respiratory illness was associated with

63

asthma in Puerto Rican children relative to other minority children.

64

Methods

65

Using a logistic regression analysis, we examined the association between early-life

66

respiratory illnesses (report of upper respiratory infection (URI), pneumonia, bronchitis,

67

and bronchiolitis/RSV) within the first two years of life and physician-diagnosed asthma

68

after the age of two in a large cohort of minority children.

69

Measurements and Main Results

70

Early-life respiratory illnesses were associated with greater asthma risk in Puerto

71

Ricans relative to other racial/ethnic minority populations. Specifically, in Puerto Ricans,

72

the odds was 6.15 (95% CI: 4.21-9.05) if the child reported at least one of the following

73

respiratory illness: URI, pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiolitis. The odds were also

74

higher in Puerto Ricans when considering these conditions separately.

75

Conclusions

76

We observe population-specific associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and

77

asthma, which was especially significant in Puerto Ricans. Taken together with the

78

known high burden of RSV in Puerto Rico, our results may help explain the high burden

79

of asthma in Puerto Ricans.

Introduction

90

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children[1, 2], with genetic,

91

environmental, and infectious risk factors.[3-5] Though the global burden of asthma is

92

increasing, certain racial/ethnic and geographic populations are at especially high risk.

93

Puerto Ricans are among the most severely affected populations in the world.[4]

94

Approximately 36.5% of Puerto Ricans report they currently or previously had asthma,

95

compared to only 13.0% of African Americans, 12.1% of European Americans, and

96

7.5% of Mexican Americans.[6] These striking differences extend to asthma morbidity

97

and mortality, which are 2.4- and 4-fold higher in Puerto Ricans compared to whites,

98

respectively.[6, 7]

99

Several epidemiological studies have established a strong association between the

100

development of childhood asthma or recurrent wheeze with exposure to severe, early-

101

life respiratory illnesses across populations.[8-18] Associations with asthma were

102

strongest for infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)[8, 11, 14-18] and

103

human rhinovirus (HRV).[12-14] Both RSV and HRV are known to cause bronchiolitis,

104

which can be a severe respiratory infection in children and is linked to later asthma

105

development.[16, 19] These viruses have a complex interaction between genetics and

106

environmental exposures in determining risks for asthma and related outcomes.[20, 21]

107

Additionally, Puerto Rico has an RSV season that is year-round whereas the mainland

108

United States only reports a 20-week season (Fig 1).[22, 23]

110

mainland United States (blue). RSV season begins when 10% or more of RSV

111

tests are positive.

112

It is unclear at this time if differential responses to early-life respiratory illnesses

113

contribute to the striking asthma disparities seen across minority populations. It is

114

possible that genetic predisposition, environmental influences, and early-life respiratory

115

illness work together to increase asthma susceptibility in high-risk populations. Our aim

116

was to investigate the association of early-life respiratory illnesses with asthma

117

susceptibility seen in our large and well-phenotyped cohort of minority children. In light

118

of disparate disease prevalence,[6, 22, 23] we examined this association in each

119

population (Puerto Ricans, African Americans and Mexican Americans), separately and

120

combined.

121

Methods

122

Study population

123

The analysis examined participants recruited through two parent studies: the Genes-

124

Environments and Admixture in Latino Americans (GALA II) study and the Study of

125

African Americans, Asthma, Genes and Environments (SAGE), described in detail

126

elsewhere.[24-26] Briefly, GALA II and SAGE are parallel case-control studies of

127

asthma conducted between 2006 to 2014 in Latino (Mexican American and Puerto

128

Rican) and African American children aged 8-21, respectively. SAGE participants were

129

recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area and GALA II participants were recruited from

130

across the continental United States (Chicago, Houston, New York City, and the San

131

Francisco Bay Area) and Puerto Rico. Questionnaires were administered to adult

132

participants and parents of minors. All participants provided consent to being in the

133

study. Consent was obtained from all adult participants and parent/legal guardians of

134

minor participants. All participating institutions obtained the appropriate approvals from

135

their Institutional Review Boards.

136

Out of a total of 6,023, participants with asthma onset prior to the age of two (n=1,450)

137

and those individuals without complete illness and covariate data (n=2,301) were

138

excluded from the study. Those diagnosed with asthma before age two were initially

139

excluded from analysis to better delineate any causal association between early-life

140

respiratory illness before age two and subsequent diagnosis of asthma. The exclusion

141

criteria yielded an analytical sample of 2,824 subjects, including both cases (n=1,091)

142

and controls (n=1,733).

143

Outcomes

144

The outcome of our study was asthma diagnosed after the age of two by a

145

physician.[24] Eligible control subjects had no reported history of asthma, lung disease,

146

or chronic illness, and no reported symptoms of coughing, wheezing, or shortness of

147

breath in the two years before enrollment.

148

Exposure

149

The exposure was self-reported early-life respiratory illnesses within the first two years

150

of life. Early-life respiratory illnesses included upper respiratory infection (URI),

151

pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis/RSV, which were analyzed separately. In

152

addition, the report of at least one of the four previous illnesses was used to categorize

153

children with “any respiratory illness” and none otherwise.

154

Covariates

155

Consistent with previous studies,[27, 28] we considered factors known to be associated

156

with early-life respiratory illnesses and with asthma. These included sex, underweight at

157

birth (yes/no), maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), whether the subject was

158

breastfed (yes/no), number of older siblings (none, one, two or more), socioeconomic

159

status (SES; low, medium, high; described further in Text A in S1 File), and recruitment

160

region; the latter of which was not used in the African American models because all the

161

participants were recruited from the same region. Global African and European ancestry

162

estimates (described further in Text B in S1 File) were additional covariates used in our

163

combined model to adjust for the underlying substructure of populations in the dataset.

164

Statistical Analysis

165

Descriptive statistics were calculated for the overall study population and for each

166

minority population separately. Logistic regression was used to study the association

167

between physician-diagnosed asthma and self-reported respiratory illnesses in the first

168

two years of life. To account for the difference in asthma prevalence[6] and the fact that

169

ethnicity acts as an effect modifier on the association, we also performed association

170

tests stratified by population. The statistical programming language R version 3.5.1 was

171

used to perform all analyses.

Data availability

173

Due to the sensitive nature of the data collected surrounding issues of race,

174

socioeconomic status, and ancestry, data are available upon request. Access to the

175

limited dataset used in this study can be arranged by contacting Dr. Esteban Burchard

176

[email: esteban.burchard@ucsf.edu]. Of note, any data provided will be stripped of

177

specific subject identifiers that could be used to identify a specific child and/or his/her

178

residence. All source code for this analysis can be accessed on our github page

179

180

Results

181

Descriptive characteristics of our final study population are presented in Table 1. When

182

compared with children without asthma, those with asthma were more likely to be male,

183

to have a mother who smoked during pregnancy, and have lower SES. These

184

distributions were observed in our sample with a few exceptions. For instance, while

185

Puerto Rican and Mexican American children without asthma were more likely to be

186

breastfed than their counterparts with asthma, the opposite was true for African

187

Americans. Additionally, we found that Puerto Ricans were 4- to 9-fold more likely to

188

report an RSV infection or bronchiolitis in the first two years of life than Mexican

189

Americans and African Americans, respectively (Fig 2).

In the population-specific stratified analyses, we also observed that the odds of asthma

196

in Puerto Ricans was 5.25 (95% CI: 3.34-8.37) for URI, 7.23 (95% CI: 2.66-23) for

197

pneumonia, 13 (95% CI: 6.51-28.2) for bronchitis, 7.27 (95% CI: 3.83-14.5) for

198

bronchiolitis/RSV, and 6.15 (95% CI: 4.21-9.05) if the participant reported having at

199

least one early-life respiratory illness (Table 2, Fig 3). Comparatively, the odds of

200

asthma in Mexican Americans and African Americans respectively was 2.17 (95% CI:

201

1.12-4.24) and 4.77 (95% CI: 2.76-8.71) for URI, 2.05 (95% CI: 0.956-4.61) and 1.9

217

To test statistically significant differences in odds ratios between racial/ethnic groups,

218

we performed a Z-test.[29] We found that there were significant differences (p < 0.05)

219

between Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans for URI and Any Listed, and between

220

Puerto Ricans and African Americans for bronchitis and pneumonia (Table A in S2

221

File).

222

In a separate analysis, we performed these associations including those individuals

223

diagnosed with asthma before the age of two (Table B in S2 File). Our results showed

224

that all early-life respiratory illnesses were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with

225

asthma diagnosis across our three populations and combined, with the exception of

226

RSV in Mexican Americans (Table C in S2 File). Additionally, Puerto Ricans had a

227

significantly higher risk of asthma after respiratory infection than Mexican Americans for

228

every respiratory infection tested (Table D in S2 File).

229

We additionally assessed the differential risk of asthma after an early-life respiratory

230

illness in Puerto Ricans living in Puerto Rico (Islanders) versus those living in the

231

mainland United States (Mainlanders); descriptive characteristics for these populations

232

can be found in Table E in S2 File. Our data suggest a high asthma risk following early-

233

life respiratory illness in Islanders relative to Mainlanders (Table F in S2 File ) though

234

due to the small number of Mainlanders we were underpowered to detect statistically

235

significant differences between these groups.

236

Discussion

237

Overall, we found that early-life respiratory illnesses such as URI, pneumonia,

238

bronchitis, and bronchiolitis/RSV are significantly associated with asthma diagnosis

239

after the age of two regardless of race/ethnicity. However, Puerto Ricans displayed the

240

strongest associations.

241

Early-life respiratory illnesses increase risk for physician-

242

diagnosed childhood asthma

243

The association between early-life respiratory illnesses and asthma has been well

244

documented.[8-18] Yet, little is known about racial/ethnic differences that underlie the

245

associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and the development of asthma

246

later on in childhood.

247

Previous research on the association between early-life respiratory infection and the

248

development of asthma has yielded conflicting results. Having a wheezing illness due to

249

RSV or HRV infection in early life has previously shown to be associated with a 2.6- and

250

9.8-fold increase, respectively, in asthma risk by age six in a mostly white

251

population.[12] Additionally, a recent study found that the severity of the RSV infection

252

was found to be strongly associated with childhood wheezing at age five in a mostly

253

white population.[11] However, the vast majority of children infected by respiratory

254

viruses like RSV do not go on to develop respiratory illnesses like recurrent wheezing

255

and asthma.[28] Currently, it is unclear why only a minority of children develop asthma

256

after exposure to an early-life respiratory illness. One plausible explanation is that these

257

respiratory illnesses alter the airway in early life, which leads to asthma later on in

258

childhood; previous studies have shown that in adults with asthma, the airway

259

epithelium is altered in a heterogeneous manner.[30] Another possibility is that children

260

who are already genetically or environmentally prone to asthma present with early-life

261

respiratory illness as an early manifestation of asthma. Indeed, previous studies have

262

shown asymptomatic carriage of RSV and rhinovirus in children,[31-33] suggesting a

263

spectrum of disease which may be affected by underlying asthma predisposition.[34,

264

35] Our results show that asthma risk increases with early-life respiratory illnesses in all

265

populations studied, but that the increase is most dramatic in the Puerto Rican

266

population. These results support previous studies[35-37] that early-life respiratory

267

illnesses are significantly associated with the development of asthma and asthma-

268

related outcomes while additionally adding that these associations may vary by region

269

or population.

270

Puerto Ricans are uniquely burdened compared to other

271

groups

272

Most children who develop respiratory viral infections in early life experience minor

273

illness, but some develop much more severe illnesses that involve lower respiratory

274

symptoms like wheezing.[9, 10, 31] These more severe wheezing illnesses at an early

275

stage in life are associated with a high risk for recurrent wheezing and asthma later in

276

childhood,[12, 13] particularly if these wheezing illnesses were caused by RSV or

277

HRV.[8, 11, 15-18] Puerto Rican children are especially at risk due to the year-round

278

seasonality of RSV infections.[22, 23] In fact, 1,406 cases of bronchiolitis/RSV were

279

reported in children with a mean age of seven months from six Puerto Rican hospitals

280

over a period of nine months.[34] Our results showed that not only is the prevalence of

281

bronchiolitis/RSV infection highest in Puerto Rican children in our study population, but

282

that the risk for asthma among children who have experienced a bronchiolitis/RSV

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19011528; this version posted November 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

283

infection in early life is the highest for Puerto Rican Islanders. These observations

284

suggest that the burden of childhood asthma after bronchiolitis/RSV is particularly high

285

Puerto Rican children.

286

In our analysis of children diagnosed with asthma after two years of age, some

287

confidence intervals were too wide to make definitive conclusions regarding the relative

288

risk of asthma after infection in different racial/ethnic groups. However, when we

289

included those children diagnosed with asthma before two years of age, the increased

290

sample size allowed us to better delineate the association between different respiratory

291

infections and asthma development as stratified by racial/ethnic group. Interestingly,

292

although Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans are both considered Hispanic/Latino

293

for pulmonary function testing and other health metrics, these populations had widely

294

divergent risks of asthma after early-life respiratory infections. Puerto Ricans

295

consistently had higher risk of asthma after all respiratory infections studied. Whether

296

the association between early-life respiratory infection and increased asthma risk is

297

causal of the alarmingly high rate of asthma in Puerto Ricans requires further study.

298

While we are not able to draw definitive conclusions about the relative risk of asthma

299

after respiratory infection in Puerto Rican Islanders versus Mainlanders due to the

300

limited number of mainland US Puerto Rican patients studied, we find it interesting that

301

Islander Puerto Ricans tended to have a lower risk of asthma after respiratory infections

302

relative to Islanders. This may suggest an environmental effect about living in Puerto

303

Rico that affects asthma risk. Further studies on Puerto Ricans living on the island and

304

in the mainland US can help clarify this observation.

305

Strengths and limitations

306

Our study may have been limited because the majority (71%) of Puerto Ricans in the

307

GALA study were diagnosed with asthma before the age of two. In contrast, only 35% of

308

Mexican Americans, and 50% of African Americans were diagnosed with asthma before

309

two years old. Our secondary analysis including children diagnosed with asthma before

310

two years of age addressed these differences. Additionally, our exposure

311

measurements were determined retrospectively, which may introduce biases in the

312

data. This study was underpowered to detect any significant associations of early-life

313

respiratory illnesses on asthma in Puerto Rican Mainlanders versus Puerto Rican

314

Islanders, and we were not able to determine whether the year-round RSV prevalence

315

in Puerto Rico modified the effect of the association between respiratory illnesses and

316

asthma. However, our study outlines that there are clear population-specific differences

317

in asthma susceptibility across a variety of respiratory illnesses using a large cohort of

318

minority children from three distinct populations. Our study also benefits from the wide

319

range of clinical, social, and genetic data available on these patients.

320

Conclusion

321

Early-life respiratory illnesses such as RSV, which is highly prevalent in Puerto Ricans,

322

have previously been associated with asthma. Our results indicate that early-life

323

respiratory infections are particularly associated with the later development of asthma

324

among Puerto Rican children compared to other populations.
