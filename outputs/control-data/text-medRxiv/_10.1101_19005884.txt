ABSTRACT

49

Background. Central nervous system (CNS) infections are important contributors to morbidity and

50

mortality and the causative agents for ~50% patients are never identified. The causative agents of some

51

CNS infections have distinct spatial and temporal patterns.

52

Methodology/Principal Findings. Here we present the results of a spatial epidemiological and

53

ecological analysis of CNS infections in Lao PDR (2003 – 2011). The data came from hospitalizations for

54

suspected CNS infection at Mahosot Hospital in Vientiane. Out of 1,065 patients, 450 were assigned a

55

confirmed diagnosis. While many communities in Lao PDR are in rural and remote locations, most

56

patients in these data came from villages along major roads. Japanese encephalitis virus ((JEV); n=94)

57

and Cryptococcus spp. (n=70) were the most common infections. JEV infections peaked in the rainy

58

season and JEV patients came from villages with higher surface flooding during the same month as

59

admission. JEV infections were spatially dispersed throughout rural areas and were most common in

60

children. Cryptococcus spp. infections clustered near Vientiane (an urban area) and among adults.

61

Conclusions/Significance. The spatial and temporal patterns identified in this analysis are related to

62

complex environmental, social, and geographic factors. For example, JEV infected patients came from

63

locations with environmental conditions (surface water) that are suitable to support larger mosquito

64

vector populations. Most patients in these data came from villages that are near major roads; likely the

65

result of geographic and financial access to healthcare and also indicating that CNS diseases are

66

underestimated in the region (especially from more remote areas). As Lao PDR is undergoing major

67

developmental and environmental changes, the space-time distributions of the causative agents of CNS

68

infection will also likely change. There is a major need for increased diagnostic abilities; increased access

69

to healthcare, especially for rural populations; and for increased surveillance throughout the nation.

AUTHOR SUMMARY

73

Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are important with regard to public health. However

74

many CNS infections are never diagnosed. In this analysis we investigated spatial and temporal patterns

75

in hospitalized patients with suspected CNS infections in Lao PDR. We found that patients were most

76

likely to come from villages located along major roads and highways. Patients from remote areas may

77

have more difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. The most commonly diagnosed infection in these

78

patients was Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Patients with this disease came from locations that were

79

optimal for the mosquito vectors that spread JEV, rural areas with surface water and during the rainy

80

season. Our analyses suggest that CNS infections should be a priority for public health workers in the

81

region. Diagnostic capabilities should be increased throughout the nation; surveillance efforts should be

82

broadened; and efforts should be increased toward providing easy access to healthcare for rural and

83

remote populations.

INTRODUCTION

Numerous illnesses go undiagnosed and the causative agents of many infections are never

98

identified. In regions where access to healthcare facilities is limited and where diagnostic capabilities are

99

few, a smaller proportion of diseases are objectively diagnosed. Diseases with mild symptoms may more

100

frequently go untreated, but in some areas even severe illnesses commonly go undiagnosed and

101

untreated. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) can be particularly severe, affecting the brain

102

and/or spinal cord and/or the surrounding meninges, frequently resulting in death.

103

Pathogens that invade and infect the CNS include viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and prions.

104

As with other infections, the causative agent(s) of many CNS infections are never determined

105

(frequently <50%) [1–3]. Symptoms of CNS infection can range widely, even for single causative agents,

106

leading to further difficulties with diagnosis. Diagnoses are frequently presumptive and non-specific (i.e.

107

meningitis is often presumed to be caused by bacteria whereas encephalitis is presumed to be caused

108

viruses [2,4–6]). Some causative agents are specific to regions (e.g. Japanese Encephalitis, Saint Louis

109

Encephalitis, Rift Valley Fever Viruses) and exhibit seasonal fluctuations (e.g. vector borne infections),

110

therefore geography and seasonality can facilitate presumptive diagnosis of CNS diseases [4,7].

111

In Southeast (SE) Asia, CNS infections are increasingly recognized as important contributors to

112

morbidity and mortality [1,8,9]. However, detailed medical and epidemiological data are frequently

113

lacking, especially for low income nations and from remote areas within middle-to-high income nations.

114

Known important viral CNS infections in SE Asia include Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and rabies

115

viruses [1]. Important bacterial CNS infections include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus

116

influenzae, S. suis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Neisseria meningitidis. Orientia tsutsugamushi,

117

Rickettsia typhi and Leptospira spp. are increasingly recognized as important causes [9]. Detailed

118

analyses that confirm the cause of CNS related infections or assess their spatial and temporal

119

distribution in the region are rare [8–11,14].

121

We recently published the results of a study of the etiology and impact of CNS infections

122

diagnosed among 1,065 patients at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Lao PDR [14]. The goal of this

123

secondary analysis was to investigate the spatial distribution(s) of CNS-related infections; to look for

124

differential spatial distributions for major causative agents; and to explore potential geographic,

125

demographic, and environmental correlates of these infections.

126

DATA AND METHODS

127

Data sources, processing and merging

128

Data used in this research were compiled from four main sources (Supporting Figure 1). The

129

epidemiological data come from an 8-year research project on CNS infections in Lao PDR from all

130

patients who received diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) at Mahosot Hospital in Vientiane, Lao PDR

131

between January 2003 and August 2011 and consenting to participate [14]. All patients were admitted

132

to the hospital because of suspected CNS infection and Mahosot Hospital is the only medical facility in

133

Lao PDR capable of performing diagnostic LP and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Tests for a large

134

panel of pathogens were performed at the Microbiology Laboratory following international standards

135

(details provided in Supporting Materials I and [14]). Demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and

136

geographic (home village) characteristics of patients were recorded in the database.

137

The epidemiological data were used to create two separate datasets: One aggregated at the

138

village level (one row per location) and another was maintained at the individual level, with one row per

139

individual. The official Lao PDR censuses from 2005 and 2015 were used to geocode villages (based on

140

village name and administrative units listed in patient records) and to assign village population

141

estimates to each village (taking a mean population size between 2005 and 2015). Village location and

142

population sizes were then merged to both the individual- and village-level datasets.

143

A subset of villages within the geographic region of the home villages of included patients was

144

selected by overlaying a standard deviational ellipse with 3 standard deviations (calculations described

145

in Supporting Materials II) around the patient home villages and then selecting all villages within that

146

ellipse (Supporting Figure 2). These villages were then retained for village level comparisons between

147

villages populated, and not populated, with patients admitted with CNS disease needing an LP. This

148

subset of villages is hereafter referred to as the “study area”.

149

Major road network data was taken from OpenStreetMaps (http://www.openstreetmap.la),

150

selecting “primary”, “secondary”, and all major connecting roads (downloaded in February 2017,

151

Supporting Figure 3). Primary and secondary roads are the two largest road classifications for the

152

nation. Primary roads link major towns and cities and secondary roads link mid-sized towns. Primary and

153

secondary link roads are ramps or slip roads that connect other roads to primary or secondary roads.

154

Together, these types of roads are hereafter referred to as “major roads”. Smaller roads were not

155

included in this analysis as they are less likely to be accurately included in the OpenStreetMaps data. The

156

Euclidian distance was then calculated from all villages in the census to the nearest point along a major

157

road. These distances were merged to both the village- and the individual-level datasets.

158

Environmental predictor variables for vegetation and surface water were derived from

159

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1 250 meter

160

AQUA/TERRA 16 day composites). Since many infectious diseases, especially vector borne diseases, are

161

strongly influenced by environmental factors we hypothesized that indicators of vegetation and surface

162

flooding would correlate with some specific diagnoses. Three environmental indices were downloaded

163

and considered in these analyses: a normalized flooding index (NFI) [15]; the normalized difference

164

vegetative index (NDVI); and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). NFI is indicative of surface water,

165

NDVI is indicative of green surface vegetation, and EVI is an improved measure of green vegetation that

166

is intended to account for dense forest canopies and atmospheric conditions that can lead to error in

167

NDVI measurements. Data were downloaded for each of these environmental indices (EI) within each

168

16-day time period from February 2002 through December of 2011. The final analyses conducted in this

169

research retained only the EVI and NFI for environmental predictors (summary statistics for NDVI are

170

included) because NDVI and EVI were strongly correlated. The EIs are described in more detail in

171

Supporting Materials III.

172

The environmental raster data were then summarized and extracted based on varying buffer

173

sizes (2km, 5km, and 10km) for each village in the individual- and village-level datasets. Permanent

174

water bodies (such as the Mekong River and Nam Ngum Dam) were masked from the NFI calculations.

175

For the village-level datasets, mean values of each environmental variable was calculated for the study

176

period duration and used as an indicator of “average” vegetation or surface water characteristics of

177

each village. For the individual-level dataset the values were extracted based on the admission date,

178

using increasing durations of time prior to admission (within the same month, within the previous 2

179

months, within the previous year).

180

The final datasets include the village-level data, that is a subsample of 98% of all villages with

181

patients included in the study and the other census designated villages within the same region (the

182

study area), and the individual level dataset that includes all patients included in the study. Variables

183

used in this analysis and their descriptions are listed in Table 1.

184

Exploratory spatial data analysis

185

Summary statistics (median; Q1:Q3; mean) were calculated for the distances between villages

186

and the nearest major road, and aggregated by whether or not the village was home to included

187

patients and by specific diagnoses. Summary statistics (mean and 95% confidence intervals) were also

188

calculated for all environmental variables, at each buffer size and temporal resolution, and for each of

189

the major diagnoses. Tukey’s post hoc range test was used to assess statistically significant differences in

190

environmental indices across diagnoses.

191

Standard distance deviations (SDDs) and standard deviation ellipses (SDEs) were calculated

192

(details in Supporting Materials II) and mapped to measure and visually analyze the central tendency

193

and spatial distributions for all patient home villages and by each of the major single (mono-infection)

194

diagnoses.

195

Formal analyses

196

Multivariable regressions were used to calculate model-adjusted odds ratios and confidence

197

intervals. The regressions at the village level focused on study patient villages and the home villages of

198

JEV diagnosed patients. A multivariable regression was also done at the individual level focusing on JEV

199

infected patients. Other diagnoses were not included in these analyses because of small numbers of

200

cases per village.

201

Logistic generalized additive models (GAMs) were used for variable selection and specification

202

(detailed in Supporting Materials IV and in Table 1) for the final models. The GAMs were used to

203

examine different specifications of the continuous environmental, geographic, and demographic

204

variables and for changes in model fit and strength of association across buffer sizes (i.e. 2km, 5km, or

205

10km buffers) and for different time durations for EI measurements (i.e. same month, 2 months prior,

206

12 months prior to hospital admission). The final model covariates were chosen based on a combination

207

of a priori hypotheses, model fit (using the Akaike information criterion), and strength of association

208

between the covariate and the model outcome variable.

209

The final model for the individual-level analysis was a generalized logistic mixed model with a

210

random effect for home village. The final model for the village-level analysis was a logistic regression.

211

Software

212

All maps were created using QGIS version 3.4.9. R cran version 3.5.2 was used for downloading,

213

processing, and wrangling MODIS data (using the “MODIStsp”; “raster”; “rgdal”; and “maptools”

214

packages) and for all regressions. The “mgcv” package was used for GAMs and the lme4 package was

215

used for the generalized mixed models. Euclidian distances between villages and major roads were

216

calculated using QGIS. ArcMap version 10.5.1 was used to calculate SDDs and SDEs.

217

Ethics approval

218

Ethical clearance for the CNS study was granted by the Oxford University Tropical Ethics

219

Research Committee and by the Ethical Review Committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, National

220

University of Laos. Between 2003 and 2006, both Oxford Tropical Ethics Committee and the Ethical

221

Review Committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, National University of Laos, approved the use of

222

oral witnessed consent. Oral consent was confirmed by a signed witness statement. Verbal consent

223

(from 2003 – 2006) and written consent (from 2006 – 2011) were obtained from all recruited patients or

224

immediate relatives. All ages were included provided that they or their guardian gave witnesses oral

225

informed consent (2003 – 2006) and written informed consent since 2006.

226

RESULTS

227

Summary statistics

228

A total of 1,065 patients were recruited with no LP contraindications and consented to have a

229

diagnostic LP; 450 (42%) were assigned a final laboratory diagnosis. The most common of these were

230

Japanese encephalitis virus ((JEV) 94 individuals); followed by Cryptococcus spp. with 70 individuals (9

231

were C. gattii)); scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi) 31; Dengue virus 27; Leptospira spp. 25; murine

232

typhus (Rickettsia typhi) 24; Streptococcus pneumoniae in 22 and 20 with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

233

124 patients died prior to discharge (out of 893 with recorded discharge type recorded).

234

The majority (666, 63%) of patients were male, with the lowest sex bias in cryptococcal

235

infections (40/70, 57% male) and the highest among dengue infections (22/27, 82% male) (Table 2). Age

236

patterns were evident in JEV and cryptococcal infections, with median ages of 13 and 33 years,

237

respectively (Table 2). Patients were linked to 582 different villages (multiple patients could come from

238

the same village): 90 villages with JEV patients, 66 with cryptococcal patients, 31 with scrub typhus

239

patients, 27 with dengue patients, 24 with leptospiral patients, and 24 with murine typhus patients. The

240

majority (870, 82%) of patients came from within Vientiane Prefecture (678, 64%) or Vientiane Province

241

(192, 18%).

242

A total of 6,416 villages (of 10,520 recorded in 2005 [16]) were selected as the study area for

243

further village level analyses (Table 3). Villages that were home to study patients were 11 times (0.7km

244

versus 6.3km, from Table 3) closer to a major road when compared to other villages within the study

245

area. Scrub typhus and JEV infected patient homes were further from major roads than other patients,

246

but the difference was not statistically significant in univariate analyses.

247

The home villages of JEV patients were more broadly dispersed (Figure 1B) than for patients

248

with other etiologies (Figure 1C), evident from the circular, larger SDE and SDD. The distribution of these

249

JEV patient home villages was also relatively isotropic, with the SDE and SDD being nearly identical.

250

Conversely, patients with cryptococcal infections were clustered near Vientiane City and along the road

251

leading North/Northwest from the urban center (Figure 1C). Scrub typhus and murine typhus infections

252

were also both clustered around Vientiane City but showed perpendicular spatial distributions

253

(Supporting Figures 4D and 4G) a pattern previously described from IgG seropositivity data from

254

Vientiane City [17]).

255

Characteristics of patient home villages

256

Mean NFI values for the 2km radius tended to be higher than for either the 5km or 10km radius

257

as surface flooding is heterogeneous and taking a mean across larger radii dilutes the measurement. The

258

opposite pattern was observed for both vegetation indices. The 2km radius for both mean NDVI and

259

mean EVI was usually smaller than at 5km or 10km radii (Figures 2 and 3).

260

Study patient villages had higher mean NFI values than non-study patient villages (Figure 2A)

261

(non-study patient villages are those in the same study area as study patient villages but were not home

262

to a study patient). The home villages of study patients diagnosed with dengue virus and cryptococcal

11
263

infections had high mean NFI values over the duration of the study period when compared to other

264

major diagnoses (Figure 2A).

265

Conversely, the home villages of study patients tended to have lower mean EVI values than non-

266

study patient villages (Figure 2C). Villages from which patients who were diagnosed with JEV were an

267

exception to this general pattern. JEV patient home villages had higher mean EVI when compared to

268

home villages of patients with dengue and cryptococcal infections (Figure 2C).

269

Home villages of patients with JEV diagnoses had lower mean NFI over the duration of the study

270

period, but had higher NFI than other major diagnoses when looking specifically at the month of

271

admission (especially when compared to cryptococcal infections and murine typhus (Figure 3A)). JEV

272

patient home villages also had higher EVI during the month of admission than most other mono-

273

infections, especially when compared to either cryptococcal infections or murine typhus (Figure 3C).

274

Scrub typhus infections had higher EVI than cryptococcal infections when the measurement was taken

275

at the 10km radius buffer (not detectable at smaller radii (Figure 3C)).

276

Home villages of patients with dengue infections had higher NFI than murine typhus or

277

Cryptococcus spp. patient home villages when considering the 2 months prior to admission (Figure 3D).

278

Cryptococcus spp. patient home villages had particularly low EVI in the two months leading up to

279

admission, especially when compared to JEV and Leptospira spp. patient home villages (Figure 3F).

280

At one year prior to admission both Cryptococcus spp. patient home and dengue virus patient home

281

villages had higher NFI than JEV patient home villages (Figure 3G).

282

Logistic regressions for geographic, environmental and demographic predictors of CNS infections

283

In agreement with univariate analyses, villages from which study patients came tended to be

284

larger in population size (Supporting Figure 4), lower in elevation (Supporting Figure 5), and closer to a

285

major road when compared to other villages within the study area (Table 4). They also had higher mean

286

levels of surface flooding, with villages in the highest NFI quadrant having over two times the odds (AOR:

in the study area (Table 4 and Figure 2). Villages from which JEV patients originated had few defining

289

characteristics in the logistic regression, other than being larger in population size (AOR: 1.74; CI: 1.55 –

290

1.96) and at lower elevations (AOR: 0.69; CI: 0.46 – 0.97) than non-study patient villages (Table 5).

291

In the individual-level analysis (Table 6), age and season were the strongest predictors of JEV

292

infections among all patients. Patients who were admitted between July and September had over seven

293

times the odds (AOR: 7.40; CI: 1.45 – 37.67) of being diagnosed with JEV when compared to patients

294

who were admitted between January and March (Table 6). JEV was most common in children aged 5

295

through 14 (AOR: 2.74; CI: 1.31 – 5.69; ages 0 – 4 as the comparison group). NFI during the month of

296

admission (10km buffer used in the regression) was also a strong predictor of JEV infection. Individuals

297

who came from villages in the highest quadrant of NFI measurements had approximately 3 times the

298

odds being diagnosed with JEV (AOR: 3.06; CI: 1.04 – 8.96). While study patients came from villages with

299

lower mean elevations, patients who were diagnosed with JEV came from higher elevation villages in

300

comparison to the other patients (AOR: 1.36; CI: 1.11 – 1.66). EVI was a significant predictor in models

301

that did not include distance to road, village population, and elevation (Table 6 M1 and M2).

302

DISCUSSION

303

Patients from this study were recruited based on symptomology and a medical procedure that is

304

only available at a single location in the nation (diagnostic LP at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane). The home

305

villages of all included study patients, regardless of diagnosis, were approximately centered on Vientiane

306

City and were closer to major roads than would be expected by chance alone. For many of the infections

307

studied in this analysis, this association is likely more related to geographic and financial access to

308

healthcare systems rather than exposure to environmental risk factors – especially for infections that

309

are more associated with rural areas (e.g. JEV). This finding also suggests that the results here may be a

310

vast underestimate of the true burden of CNS infections, with much of the Lao population not being in

311

near proximity to a major road (Table 3). The causative agents of CNS infections differ in biology,

312

ecology, and geography, and this is evident through the spatial distributions of the home villages of

313

patients. The geographic, environmental, and demographic patterns exhibited by patients needing a

314

diagnostic LP for suspected CNS infections, and for specific diagnoses, are the result of complex

315

overlapping factors.

316

A similar spatial pattern was described from an epidemiological analysis of CNS infections

317

among children admitted to Ho Chi Minh City hospitals in Vietnam – with most patients coming from

318

districts near the hospital [18]. While the majority of infections (55%) in the Vietnam study were

319

presumed to be bacterial in origin, in this study from Lao PDR bacterial infections were identified in only

320

38% (170 out of 450 patients with diagnoses).

321

JEV was the single largest identified cause of CNS infections in these data; it primarily affected

322

children (median 13 years of age, Table 2), occurred predominantly during the rainy season (likely

323

corresponding to peaks in mosquito vector populations), and in villages with recent high levels of

324

surface water [19]. JEV is a vaccine-preventable disease, but the vaccine has historically been expensive

325

and vaccine programs are frequently limited by access to remote communities. In 2013 the WHO

326

approved a less expensive vaccine (produced in China by the Chengdu Institute of Biological Products)

327

which has since been used in mass vaccination campaigns in Lao PDR in 2013 and 2015 [20]. The vaccine

328

is now routinely given to all children less than 9 months of age but coverage may be low in some areas.

329

The second largest contributor to CNS diseases were cryptococcal infections, which are

330

opportunistic fungal infections with high mortality [21]. Of the 70 patients with cryptococcal infections,

331

12 died prior to discharge and another 8 likely died at home after leaving the hospital. Cryptococcal

332

infections are generally acquired after inhalation of the yeast-like form of the fungus which has been

333

associated with several ecological habitats (Cryptococcus gattii has been associated with over 50 species

334

of trees; Cryptococcus neoformans has been associated with bird droppings but is also suspected to be

14
335

associated with plants [22,23]). This disease has a long incubation period [24,25] and while C. gattii

336

infections commonly occur among immunocompetent individuals, C. neoformans infections are

337

frequently associated with HIV infections [26,27]. In these data, 20 of the patients diagnosed with

338

cryptococcal infections also had HIV infections. While several studies have shown that cryptococcal

339

species exist in specific ecological habitats and have inferred environmental exposure, the long

340

incubation period and complex natural history likely obfuscate ecological correlations.

341

There are several limitations to this research. Diagnostic LPs are only conducted in Mahosot

342

Hospital in the national capital. Logistical and financial difficulties in accessing healthcare facilities, and

343

especially for etiological diagnostic capabilities, likely leads to severe under-reporting of meningitis,

344

encephalitis, or in the diagnosing the causative agent in these conditions when the patient does access

345

care. All of these factors ultimately lead to small case counts for numerous different causative agents.

346

The spatial patterns in points (villages) and ellipses exhibited in these data are likely influenced by the

347

shape of the nation and it is possible that the point patterns and ellipses would differ if we had data

348

from neighboring nations. Spatial and temporal patterns that differentiate different infections might be

349

more obvious if the surveillance system instead focused on any symptomatic infections (rather than only

350

suspected infections of the CNS). Some pathogens are neurotropic whereas others have tropism for

351

other organs, while being capable of occasionally infecting the CNS. This may partially explain the higher

352

case counts of JEV and why we were able to identify spatial, temporal, and environmental predictors for

353

this causative agent.

354

OpenStreetMaps data are volunteered data and may be prone to error. For this reason we

355

focused on major roads, whose routes have changed very little over the last decades. For the

356

regressions, the distances from all villages to the nearest major road was also rounded to the nearest

357

5km. Examination of satellite imagery in comparison with the major roads from OpenStreetMaps

358

suggests that where error does exist, it is on a scale of +100 meters, meaning that measurements of

15
359

distances, as used in this analysis, should not be strongly influenced. Some of these data now come from

360

over a decade ago. Surveillance systems of this type (based on relatively vague symptomology), with a

361

wide panel of possible contributing causative agents, and necessary intensive laboratory components

362

are extremely labor and time intensive.

363

Lao PDR is currently undergoing vast environmental, demographic, and economic changes. Road

364

networks are increasing in range and density and several areas (i.e. Vientiane, Savannakhet) are

365

undergoing expansive urbanization [28]. These environmental changes will most likely result in shifting

366

patterns of infectious diseases. As the region undergoes urbanization (including both a decrease in

367

urban landscape and movement of human populations to urban centers), pathogens that thrive in rural

368

areas (e.g. JEV) may undergo reduced transmission, especially if vaccine campaigns are more capable of

369

reaching rural populations. Conversely, infections that cluster in urban and peri-urban areas (such as

370

dengue and murine typhus) may increase in frequency.

371

Several environmental indices from remote sensing instruments have shown potential for

372

predicting disease risk, differentiating disease types, or for other surveillance efforts in SE Asia [29,30]

373

and globally [31–35]. This analysis, and others like it, illustrates the ability to differentiate some

374

infections (namely JEV when compared to other diagnoses) through the use of freely available data (i.e.

375

MODIS) and software (R and QGIS) and routinely collected healthcare data. Surveillance systems and

376

potentially diagnostic algorithms [36] in developing settings could benefit from inclusion of such

377

resources. A far-reaching surveillance system that is representative of the entire nation and includes

378

likely CNS infections would be beneficial in order to assess the true burden of CNS infections – many of

379

which would benefit from primary and secondary prevention through increased provision of vaccines,

380

vector control, and early diagnosis and treatment. Given the inherent difficulties in accurately

381

diagnosing and treating CNS infections, the predictors reported here and from other epidemiological

382

studies for major contributors to CNS diseases (i.e. age, seasonality, location, and environmental

383

characteristics) could be considered alongside clinical symptomology when presumptive diagnoses are

384

being made. However, it will be important to consider current and ongoing demographic,

385

environmental, and economic changes in Lao PDR.

386

Finally, increasing population access to vaccines, diagnosis, and treatment would have clear

387

benefits to overall population health. As with other parts of the developing world, a large fraction of the

388

Lao population must travel long distances in order to reach primary healthcare centers. In 2005 73% of

389

the Lao population was reported to live in rural areas, 21% without roads. By 2015 67% of the

390

population were reported to live in rural villages with 8% in villages without roads [37]. For many

391

communities, travel during the wet season remains difficult. Travel costs can also be prohibitive. Most of

392

the CNS infections in this analysis occurred or developed symptoms during the wet season. Public

393

health initiatives that help to decrease the distances between communities and the healthcare services

394

that they need are warranted.

Variable

description

Village population

Population estimate of LP patient home village.
This is calculated as a mean population value
from the Lao PDR official census from years 2005
and 2015.

This is the distance in meters from the LP
patient home village and the nearest point on a
major highway network, from the
Distance to major road OpenStreetMaps map layer. This distance was
transformed into kilometers and rounded to the
nearest 5 kilometers in order to account for
measurement error.
