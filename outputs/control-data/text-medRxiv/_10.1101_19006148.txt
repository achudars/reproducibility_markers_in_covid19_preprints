ABSTRACT
Background: It is imperative that non-compliance to statins be identified and addressed to
optimize the clinical benefit of statins. Patient self-reporting methods are convenient to apply in
clinical practice but need to be validated.
Objective: We studied the concordance of a patient self-report method, MMAS (Morisky eight
item medication adherence scale) with pill count method in measuring adherence to statins and
their correlation with extended lipid profile parameters and serum HMGCoA-R
(hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) enzyme levels.
Methods: MMAS and pill count method were used to measure the adherence to statins in
patients on statins for any duration. Patients were subjected to estimation of extended lipid
profile and serum HMGCoA-R levels at the end of 3 months follow-up.
Results: Out of a total of 200 patients included in the study, 117 patients had low adherence
(score less than 6 on MMAS) whereas 65 and 18 patients had medium (score 6 to less than 8)
and high adherence (score of 8) respectively. Majority of patients who had low adherence to
statins by MMAS were nonadherent by pill count method yielding concordance of 96.5%.
Medium or high adherence to statins by MMAS method had concordance of 89.1% with pill
count method. The levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein- cholesterol, apolipoprotein
B and HMGCoA-R were significantly negatively correlated with compliance measured by pill
count and MMAS with similar correlation coefficients. HMGCoA-R levels demonstrated a
plateau phenomenon with levels being 9-10 ng/ml when compliance to statin therapy was greater
than 60% by pill count and greater than 6 on Morisky scale.
Conclusion: In conclusion, MMAS and pill count methods showed concordance in measuring
adherence to statins. These methods need to be explored further for their interchangeability as
surrogates for biomarker levels.

INTRODUCTION
Statins are the most effective lipid-lowering agents which reduce the risk of coronary events by
17%-26%. (1) The benefits of statins are lost when patients are poorly compliant and it is
reported that only 50% of patients who are being treated with statins continue to use their
medication after six months, and only 30% to 40% after one year. (2, 3) Hence, it is imperative
that non-compliance to statins be identified to optimize the clinical benefit of statins. Usually,
treating physicians do not inquire about patients’ adherence to the medication (4). Medication
adherence can be assessed by pill count, pharmacy fill rates, surrogate marker levels, patient selfreporting methods e.g. Morisky medication adherence scale 8-item (MMAS) etc. The most
convenient ones are patient self-reporting methods which can be easily applied in clinical setting
but they are generally not specific for a disease or drug. (6, 7) There is a need to understand and
validate MMAS for measuring compliance to statins in dyslipidemic patients. Hence, the present
study evaluated the concordance of MMAS(8) with pill count method in measuring compliance
to statins in dyslipidemic patients and also correlated the extent of compliance to statins with
lipid profile like and serum 3- hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA-R)
enzyme levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Dyslipidemic patients with age above 18 years, elevated LDL (low density lipoprotein) levels
and/or TG (triglyceride) levels, and/or low HDL (high density lipoprotein) levels as per ACCAHA (American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association) guidelines (2) and on
statin therapy for any duration were included in the study. Patients who had ACS (acute coronary
syndrome) within the last 3 months, history of hypothyroidism, pregnancy/lactation and
hypersensitivity or intolerance to statins were excluded from the study.
Study Design
In a prospective observational study, information of patients’ personal, demographic and
socioeconomic status was recorded. They were assessed for compliance to statins using MMAS
and pill count method (9) at the end of 3 month after refilling of medicine. Patients with a score
of pill count ≥80% were considered compliant whereas based on MMAS scores, the patients
were categorized into the 3 levels of adherence i.e. high adherence (score, 8), medium adherence
(score, 6 to <8), and low adherence (score, <6) to facilitate its use. (8) (Figure 1)

Study protocol was approved by the Institutional Human Ethical Committee. A written informed
consent was taken from all the patients.
The decision to start the statins or to escalate their doses if required was at the discretion of the
treating physician. Patients who required dose modification from one intensity of statin therapy
to another with in the follow up period were excluded from the study.
A 5 ml venous blood sample of all the patients was taken to analyse extended lipid profile
parameters including total cholesterol (TC), LDL, TG, HDL, Apolipoprotein A1,
Apolipoprotein B and serum HMG CoA-R enzyme levels using ELISA (enzyme linked
immunosorbesnt assay) method with BMAssay HMGCoA-R kit and AssayPro Apo A1 and Apo
B ELISA kits.
Statistical Considerations
The compliance data are presented as percentages for pill count and as mean of proportions for
MMAS whereas lipid profile parameters are presented as mean±standard deviation and the
agreement between MMAS and pill count is described by percentage concordance. The trend of
pill count across MMAS categories was analysed using least square and maximum likelihood
ratio for discrete and continuous variables respectively. The Pearson’s correlation analysis was
used for correlation for compliance with lipid profile and serum HMG CoA reductase levels. p
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Low adherence to statins by MMAS method was observed in 117 patients who also showed no
adherence by pill count method (n=113) yielding concordance of 96.5%. There were 83 patients
who had medium or high adherence to statins by MMAS method and 74 of these were adherent
by pill count method yielding concordance of 89.1%. When low and medium adherence
categories by MMAS were clubbed together, their concordance with nonadherence by pill count
was 67% whereas the concordance of high adherence by MMAS with adherence by pill count
was 100%. (Table 2)

The levels of total cholesterol, LDL, HMG CoA-R and Apo B were significantly negatively
correlated with compliance measured by pill count and MMAS. The levels of HDL-C were
positively correlated with compliance by both measures. Serum LDL levels show similar
negative correlation with compliance by MMAS (r=-0.750, p=0.000) and pill count (r=-0.776,
p=0.000). HMG CoA-R also shows similar negative correlation with compliance by MMAS (r=0.497, p=0.000) and pill count (r=-0511, p=0.000). And Apo B shows negative correlation with
MMAS (r=-0.239, p=0.001) and pill count (-0.233, p=0.001). (Table 3)

HMG CoA-R levels demonstrated a plateau phenomenon with levels being 9-10 ng/ml when
compliance to statin therapy was greater than 60% by pill count and greater than 6 on the

DISCUSSION
Prevalence of non-compliance to statins
Compliance to statins is only around 50% at the end of 1 year of initiation of treatment. (10)
Clinicians require information on medication adherence to draw proper conclusions about the
effectiveness of treatment. The goal is to have access to a quick, reasonably accurate self-report
adherence measure for use in outpatient settings to facilitate clinical decision making. A quick
and accurate assessment of compliance can be especially beneficial for dyslipidemic patients in
choosing between measures to increase compliance or switching to higher intensity of statins.
(11)
Compliance assessment for statins using Morisky medication adherence scale and pill
count methods
We evaluated the association and concordance of the MMAS with pill count in measuring
compliance to statins as no other study is available which evaluated this aspect. Majority of
patients who had low adherence to statins by MMAS method were nonadherent by Pill count
method showing concordance whereas medium or high adherence to statins by MMAS method
yielded concordance of 89.1%. (Table 2). When low and medium adherence categories by
MMAS were clubbed together, their concordance with nonadherence by pill count was 67%
whereas the concordance of high adherence by MMAS with adherence by pill count was 100%.
(Table 2) This suggested a score of lower than 6 on MMAS is a better predictor of nonadherence than defining non adherence as having a score of less than 8 on MMAS.
The identification of patients with low adherence may facilitate implementation of suitable
interventions and aid in optimization of therapeutic benefit. There are numerous behaviors

related to non-adherence which may be modifiable including lack of mindfulness, forgetting,
complexity of treatment regimen etc. (12-20) Some of these can be identified using the responses
of patients to individual items of MMAS and can enable appropriate interventions to improve
adherence but this aspect needs to be explored further in dyslipidemic patients. (21)
Compliance to statins and correlation with biomarkers of dyslipidemia
We also correlated the compliance to statins derived by MMAS and pill count methods with lipid
profile and serum HMG CoA reductase enzyme levels. There was a significant negative
correlation between total cholesterol, LDL, HMG CoA-R and Apo B levels and compliance by
pill count and MMAS. Also, HDL shows significant positive correlation with compliance by
both methods. Serum LDL levels show similar negative correlation with compliance by MMAS
(r=-0.750, p=0.000) and pill count (r=-0.776, p=0.000). And Apo B also shows similar negative
correlation with MMAS (r=-0.239, p=0.001) and pill count (-0.233, p=0.001) No study is
available to compare the findings of our study. The similar correlation coefficients of different
parameters with compliance by MMAS and Pill count suggest a parallel in MMAS and pill count
methods as measures of compliance.
HMG CoA-R shows similar negative correlation with compliance by MMAS (r=-0.497,
p=0.000) and pill count (r=-0511, p=0.000). Also, the levels of HMG CoA-R show a plateau at
levels of 9-10 ng/ml when compliance is beyond 60% by pill count method and greater than
score of 6 on MMAS. (Figure 4, 5) This suggested that high adherence defined by either of the
two methods correlates with HMG CoA-R level of 9-10 ng/ml and this cut off could potentially
be explored as a surrogate marker for defining adherence and non-adherence. Also, it would be
beneficial in estimating the effectiveness of treatment.

Study Limitations
Shortcomings of self-report include reliance on recall (Questions 1,2,4 and 5 in MMAS) and
social desirability bias, with a tendency to overestimate adherence.(12) As an indirect measure,
pill counts can misrepresent adherence as well, particularly since they fail to measure whether
medication was taken on schedule.(9)

CONCLUSIONS
MMAS and pill count methods of estimating compliance showed concordance and compliance
by both the methods correlated in a similar manner with the modification in the extended lipid
profile levels and with the inhibition of HMG CoA-R levels. Settings where lipid profile and
HMG COA-R estimation is not available, if compliance of statins by MMAS is more than score
of 6 or more than 60-80% by pill count method, it can be assumed that the benefit of statins have
been adequately extended to the patient.

Perspectives
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Settings where lipid profile and HMG CoAR estimation is not available, if compliance to statins by MMAS is more than score of 6 or more
than 60-80% by pill count method, it can be assumed that the benefit of statins has been
adequately extended to the patient.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies are needed to explore the utility of responses
to individual items on Morisky medication adherence questionnaire to identify modifiable
behaviors related to non-adherence to statins which can enable appropriate interventions to
optimize therapeutic benefit.
