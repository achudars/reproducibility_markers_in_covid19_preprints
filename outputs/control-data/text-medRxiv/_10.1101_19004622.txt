ABSTRACT
Somatization may contribute to persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In
two independently-recruited study samples, we characterized the extent to which symptoms
atypical of mTBI but typical for somatoform disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal upset, joint pain)
were present in adult patients with prolonged recovery following mTBI. The first sample was
cross-sectional and consisted of mTBI patients recruited from the community who reported
ongoing symptoms attributable to a previous mTBI (n = 16) along with a healthy control group
(n = 15). The second sample consisted of patients with mTBI prospectively recruited from a
Level 1 trauma center who had either good recovery (GOSE = 8; n = 33) or poor recovery
(GOSE < 8; n = 29). In all participants, we evaluated atypical somatic symptoms using the
Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and typical post-concussion symptoms with the Rivermead
Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire. Participants with poor recovery from mTBI had
significantly higher ‘atypical’ somatic symptoms as compared to the healthy control group in
Sample 1 (b = 4.308, p = 9.43E-5) and to mTBI patients with good recovery in Sample 2 (b =
3.287, p = 6.83E-04). As would be expected, participants with poor outcome in Sample 2 had a
higher burden of typical rather than atypical symptoms (t(28) = 3.675, p = 9.97E-04, d = 0.94).
However, participants with poor recovery still reported atypical somatic symptoms that were
significantly higher (1.4 standard deviations, on average) than those with good recovery. Our
results suggest that although ‘typical’ post-concussion symptoms predominate after mTBI, a
broad range of somatic symptoms also frequently accompanies mTBI, and that somatization may
represent an important, modifiable factor in mTBI recovery.

INTRODUCTION
An estimated forty-two million people experience mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI)
worldwide annually.1 Symptoms generally resolve within the first week; however, a substantial
number of patients experience chronic symptoms for months or years after injury, leading to
significant disability and functional impairment.2, 3 Although there are many factors that
influence the recovery trajectory, pre- and post-injury mental health problems are the strongest
established contributor to poor recovery and functional limitation after mTBI.4, 5
The term post-concussion syndrome (PCS) dates back to at least World War II where, based
mainly on studies of soldiers with blast injury (i.e., ‘shell shock’), it was characterized by
headache, dizziness, fatigue, tinnitus, memory impairment, poor concentration and nervousness.6
The Rivermead Post-Concussion Syndrome questionnaire (RPQ) was developed in 1995 by
aggregating the 16 most commonly reported post-concussion symptoms,7 and remains endorsed
by the National Institute for Neurological Diseases and Stroke Common Data Elements as the
instrument of choice for evaluating post-concussion symptoms in adults. Although there is
significant ongoing debate as to the etiology of some of the symptoms the endurance of this
legacy instrument, unmodified, reflects at least some consensus that these are the cardinal
features expected after a brain injury.
Somatization is a process whereby psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms, which
can occur in the presence or absence of organic pathology.8 Historically ‘medically unexplained
symptoms’ have served as the foundation for the diagnosis of somatization and somatoform
disorders, recognizing that, at times, it can be difficult or impossible to differentiate these
symptoms from those resulting from general medical conditions (GMC).9 When these symptoms
do occur in the context of an associated GMC, somatization can be diagnosed when the severity
of the symptom exceeds what can be logically attributed to the GMC. When somatization is left
undiagnosed and untreated, these physical symptoms and associated dysfunction typically persist
or worsen, which leads to considerable costs to society and the health care system.10 In addition,
patients are often at risk for iatrogenic harm from unnecessary medical investigations and
treatments.11

There is an emerging literature pointing to an etiological role for somatization in prolonging the
recovery process after mTBI.12-17 Two previous studies in pediatric patients recruited from
emergency departments have examined measures of somatization after mTBI, both finding that
higher measures of somatization were associated with prolonged symptom duration.12, 17 A recent
study of high school and collegiate athletes found pre-injury somatic symptom scores to be the
strongest pre-morbid predictor of post-concussive symptom duration.13 However, like most other
studies analyzing somatic symptoms after mTBI, Nelson et al. (2016) evaluated somatization
using a composite score reflective of somatic complaints across multiple body systems, and did
not distinguish the somatic symptoms that would be conventionally associated with mTBI (e.g.,
headache and dizziness) from others that would be more likely related to somatoform pathology
(e.g., intestinal upset, diffuse body pains, etc). In so doing, they are potentially conflating organic
brain injury with psychopathology.
Three studies, performed in the context of comprehensive health assessments in military
personnel, have used somatic symptom scales broken down by item to evaluate somatic
symptoms post-TBI, allowing for an assessment of the type of somatic symptoms experienced
after mTBI. These studies consistently document an elevated level of somatic symptoms not
plausibly related to head injury after TBI (e.g., chest pain, heart pounding or racing, shortness of
breath).14-16 Critically, these atypical somatic symptoms may be prognostic, as a study in military
personnel by Lee et al. (2015) found that an aggregated metric of pre-injury somatic symptoms
was associated with the subsequent development of post-concussion syndrome.16 However,
while these military studies suggest significantly heightened somatic symptoms post-TBI, the
high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities confounds causative inference. For example, Hoge
et al. (2008) documented a 44% prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 27%
prevalence of major depression after mTBI with loss of consciousness, and concluded that PTSD
and depression are strongly associated with physical health problems upon return from
deployment.15 They further suggest that PTSD or depression mediate the majority of the
relationship between mTBI and subsequent somatic complaints.15 If this is correct, given lower
rates of PTSD and depression in the civilian population as compared to military members,18 after
civilian mTBI we might expect lower levels of somatization than in a military sample. However,

if elevated somatization contributes to poorer recovery from mTBI independent of other mental
health concerns, then rates in civilians with persistent symptoms might also be high.
Our aim was to evaluate symptoms atypical of mTBI (i.e., symptoms not typically related to the
mechanism of injury) in adult civilians who had poor recovery from their mTBI and who had no
other pre-injury history of psychopathology. First in an initial pilot study, and subsequently
replicated in a prospectively-recruited sample, we administered a modified version of the most
widely used assessment instrument for somatization symptoms, the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-15), that had the four questions that reflect typical post-concussion complaints (i.e.,
headache, dizziness, insomnia and fatigue) removed. We hypothesized that mTBI patients with
poor recovery would report a higher severity of symptoms not typically associated with brain
injury (e.g., gastrointestinal upset, sexual dysfunction, etc.) compared to those with good
recovery and also as compared to a healthy control group. Support for this hypothesis would
provide further evidence for an association between somatization and prolonged recovery from
mTBI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study occurred in two phases and drew from two independently-recruited sources
(recruitment flow chart shown in Figure 1). Informed consent was provided by all participants,
and studies were approved by the University of British Columbia (UBC) Clinical Research
Ethics Board (H16-01307 and H15-01063).
Participants and study design: Sample 1
Initially, in the context of an exploratory pilot study, we recruited a cross-sectional sample of 16
patients who had sustained an mTBI more than 30 days previously and who self-reported
persistent symptoms from that mTBI. We also recruited 15 healthy controls from the community
through an institutional newsletter. Healthy controls were included if they reported no TBI
during their lifetime. Mild traumatic brain injury was assessed with the Ohio State University
TBI identification method in accordance with the World Health Organization definition of

mTBI.19, 20 Mild traumatic brain injury participants and healthy controls were had to be between
18 and 50 years of age and fluent in English, and were excluded if they self-reported any
diagnosed psychiatric illness or substance abuse.
Participants and study design: Sample 2
Based on results from our initial pilot study we then assessed an additional subset of participants
from an ongoing prospectively observational study of TBI patients entitled ‘A national biobank
and database for patients with TBI (CanTBI).’ Participants were included in the broader CanTBI
study if they (i) had a diagnosis of a mild, moderate, or severe TBI made by a physician; (ii) had
at least one blood draw for research purposes within 24 hours of injury; and (iii) were fluent in
English or French. Participants were excluded from CanTBI if they (i) had any
neurodevelopmental or ongoing neurological disorder; (ii) had suffered a stroke, cardiac arrest,
or had significant disruptive neurological issues; (iii) were brain dead or suffered from a terminal
illness (life expectancy < 12 months at assessment); (iv) or were currently a prisoner, patient in
custody, or enrolled in an intervention trial. From this broader CanTBI study, we evaluated
somatic symptom scores in adult patients with mTBI who had no other diagnosed psychiatric
illness or substance abuse (Figure 1). Participants were excluded from our analysis if they had (i)
sustained a moderate or severe TBI; (ii) were less than 18 years of age; (iii) had not completed
both the Rivermead and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 at a follow-up time point three
months post-TBI or greater; and (iv) had a history of diagnosed psychiatric illness. CanTBI
participants were classified into either a ‘good recovery’ group or ‘poor recovery’ group based
on the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (operationalized below).
Measures
In both study samples, mTBI symptoms were assessed with the Rivermead Post-Concussion
Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ).7 The RPQ consists of 16 questions about post-concussion
symptoms on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (‘not experienced at all’) to 4 (‘a severe problem’).
All scores of 1 or greater were included in total score calculations, for a potential maximum
score of 64. In both study samples, somatic symptoms experienced in the 4 weeks preceding

evaluation were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), which is a 15question subset of the full PHQ.21 The PHQ-15 is a commonly used instrument for the
assessment of somatic symptoms that is a both valid and reliable proxy measure of
somatization.22, 23 It is used to assess 15 non-specific physical symptoms spanning multiple organ
systems.21 PHQ-15 scores possess moderate-to-good diagnostic accuracy for identifying
somatoform disorder as assessed with a structured interview for the Diagnostic and Statistics
Manual (DSM)-IV,24 and somatic symptom disorder assessed with a structured interview for the
DSM-V.25 Each PHQ-15 item can be rated as ‘not bothered at all’, ‘bothered a little’, or
‘bothered a lot’, resulting in a score of 0, 1, or 2 points per question respectively, for a range
from 0 – 30. A score of 1 or more on a PHQ-15 item was considered a positive endorsement of
that somatic symptom. All data were collected with the secure, electronic REDCap Data Capture
Tool hosted at the BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute.26
To examine symptoms atypical of mTBI in both study samples, we excluded PHQ-15 items a
priori that were most likely etiologically related to mTBI (a method previously employed by Lee
et al. (2015)). Specifically, we excluded the questions about headaches, dizziness, feeling tired or
having low energy, and trouble sleeping. The remaining eleven PHQ-15 items were considered
‘atypical’ for mTBI, and included stomach pain, back pain, pain in arms, legs or joints, menstrual
cramps, chest pain, fainting spells, heart pounding or racing, shortness of breath, problems
during intercourse, constipation, loose bowels or diarrhea, or nausea, bloating, or indigestion.
Where listed, ‘PHQ-15’ is the total score on the full PHQ-15 (maximum score 30 and including
all 15 questions) and the ‘atypical’ symptom subset is the total score for the 11-question subset
of the PHQ-15 which queries only the symptoms that would be considered ‘atypical’ after mTBI
(maximum score 22).
In the prospectively-recruited sample, we used the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) to
evaluate outcome from mTBI.27 The GOSE has eight categories to measure global neurological
function or death; it is a sensitive outcome measures across the injury severity spectrum,
including in mTBI.28, 29 It parallels other indicators of recovery including post-concussion
symptoms,30 and is endorsed as one of the few core mTBI outcome measure by the NINDS
Common Data Elements group.31 As in other large multi-site mTBI studies32 participants with a

GOSE score of 8/8 were considered to have ‘good recovery’, while participants with a GOSE
score < 8 were considered to have ‘poor recovery’. Of the 62 participants 33 had good recovery,
and 29 had poor recovery at the time of assessment.
Statistical analysis
For between-group comparisons we used independent-samples t-tests for continuous variables if
normally distributed (as assessed with a Shapiro-Wilk test) or Mann-Whitney U-tests for nonnormally distributed continuous variables, and Chi-squared tests for categorical variables or
Fisher’s Exact Tests for categorical variables if the expected cell count was less than five. To test
for differences in RPQ, PHQ-15 total score, and atypical symptom scores from the PHQ-15, we
used multiple linear regression models (with R2 as the measure of effect size), adjusting for age
and gender in the cross-sectionally recruited sample, and adjusting for age, gender, and number
of days post-injury in the prospectively recruited sample. In the prospectively-recruited sample,
we assessed the relative symptom burden of typical mTBI symptoms (RPQ), global somatic
symptoms (PHQ-15 total score), and atypical somatic symptoms from the PHQ-15 in the group
with poor recovery. To do this, we first internally standardized participant scores on each
measure into z-scores, using the good recovery group as the reference. We then compared mean
z-scores on each of the three outcomes within the poor recovery group using paired t-tests with
Cohen’s d to calculate effect size. This allowed us to determine the predominant symptom
burden reported by individuals with poor recovery after mTBI. Statistical analysis was
performed using R version 3.6.0.33
RESULTS
Demographic and injury-related data, as well as unadjusted RPQ and PHQ-15 scores for both
study samples are presented in Table 1. In the cross-sectionally recruited sample, there were no
significant differences in age or gender between the symptomatic and healthy control groups.
There were no significant differences in age and gender between the good and poor recovery
groups in the prospectively recruited study, nor were there differences in peri-injury variables
including LOC, GCS, mechanism of injury, whether or not participants received a head CT scan

or had acute trauma-related finding on those CT scans. The cross-sectionally recruited
symptomatic group and the prospectively recruited poor recovery group were not significantly
different in the number of days post-injury (U = 209, p = 0.843), nor were the prospectivelyrecruited good and poor recovery groups (U = 424.5, p = 0.450).

Figure 1. Flow chart outlining participant recruitment for both study samples.

In the cross-sectional study, as anticipated, post-concussion symptom scores (b = 31.650, p =
2.27E-10, adjusted R2 = 0.77) and global somatic symptom scores (b = 8.757, p = 9.57E-08,
adjusted R2 = 0.64) were higher in the symptomatic group as compared to the control group,
adjusting for age and gender. Our hypothesis was initially supported in this pilot study, as the
group with persistent symptoms from their mTBI had significantly higher atypical somatic
symptoms as compared to healthy controls adjusting for age and gender (Fig 2; b = 4.308, p =
9.43E-5, adjusted R2 = 0.39). We then replicated our findings in the prospectively recruited
sample: The poor recovery group had significantly higher post-concussion symptom scores (b =
16.802, p = 6.41E-07, adjusted R2 = 0.33) and global somatic symptom scores (b = 5.686, p =
2.08E-05, adjusted R2 = 0.25), adjusting for age, gender, and time since injury. Our hypothesis
was replicated and again supported in the prospectively recruited sample, with the poor recovery

group in the cross-sectionally recruited sample. Error bars denote one standard error, and ‘***’
denotes a p < 0.001.

We then sought to determine the relative burden of symptom subtypes experienced by those with
poor recovery in the prospective sample. Participants with poor recovery endorsed typical postconcussive symptoms (RPQ) 2.9 (SD = 2.7) standard deviations higher, on average, than those
with good recovery, global somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) approximately 2.0 (SD = 2.1) standard
deviations higher than those with good recovery, and atypical somatic symptoms 1.4 (SD = 1.9)
standard deviations higher than the group with good recovery. Using paired t-tests, we found that
participants with poor outcome from mTBI had a higher burden of typical post-concussive
symptoms than global somatic symptoms (t(28) = 3.675, p = 9.97E-04, d = 0.94) and atypical
symptoms (t(28) = 4.748, p = 5.530E-05, d = 0.99), Figure 3.

the Patient Health Questionnaire-15, and ‘atypical somatic symptoms’ are a subset of questions
from the PHQ-15 that exclude those symptoms most plausibly related to mTBI.
DISCUSSION
Corroborating the limited prior work in this area, we found that heightened post-concussive and
global somatic symptoms were associated with prolonged recovery following mTBI.
Additionally, we provide evidence that civilians with poor recovery from mTBI experience a
significantly greater degree of somatic symptoms which are atypical following mTBI, as
compared to healthy controls and those with good recovery from mTBI. These results provide
further evidence for a role of somatization in persistent symptomology following mTBI.
The only prospective civilian study to link somatization to prolonged recovery from mTBI was
recently reported by Nelson and colleagues (2016). Although they did not specifically examine
‘atypical’ symptoms, they did demonstrate a pronounced effect of pre-injury somatization on
post-mTBI recovery in athletes. In a univariate analysis on the Brief Symptom Inventory-18,34
somatization scores were the strongest pre-injury predictor of recovery duration, even when
considered alongside a comprehensive list of pre-injury demographic and history variables (i.e.,
gender, education, learning disabilities, headache history, number of prior concussions or type
and duration of sporting history), psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety), cognitive
performance, and balance scores. Path analysis indicated that these somatization symptoms
likely affected recovery through a mediating effect on post-concussion symptoms, and the
authors therefore conclude that somatization may heighten the experience of post-concussion
symptoms or increase symptom reporting, subsequently leading to prolonged recovery.
Our study expands on the work of Nelson et al. (2016) by highlighting that not only typical
somatic symptoms, but somatic symptoms etiologically unrelated to mTBI, are associated with
poor outcome after adult civilian mTBI. This raises the possibility that somatization may be a
potentially important modifying factor in the recovery trajectory, and emphasizes the clinical
need for measurement of a broad array of somatic symptoms following mTBI. Specifically
evaluating ‘atypical’ somatic symptoms may also help to identify individuals suffering from a

somatoform disorder that is primarily responsible for, or significantly magnifying their persistent
symptomology. This distinction is critical as treatment for somatization is distinctly different
than treatment for mTBI.35 Without appropriate identification of somatization, patients cannot be
connected with effective interventions. This puts them at high risk for iatrogenic effects from
unnecessary medical treatments,11 as well as potential worsening by well-meaning clinicians
advising typical interventions for mTBI such as rest and symptom avoidance.
Prior authors have raised skepticism about whether symptoms after mTBI represent a true
syndrome – a constellation of symptoms that predictably and uniquely co-occur.36, 37 If
somatization is a major mechanism underlying persistent symptoms, we might expect unclear
boundaries between what are typically referred to as ‘post-concussion’ symptoms and other
kinds of somatic symptoms, and that the PHQ-15 and the modified 11-item version would have
been similarly elevated as compared to the RPQ in patients with prolonged recovery from mTBI.
We found that both mTBI-related symptoms and symptoms atypical of mTBI were significantly
higher among patients with poor recovery from mTBI when compared to both the control and
good recovery groups. However, our results indicate that relative to atypical somatic symptoms,
mTBI-related symptoms are more strongly associated with poor outcome. Several explanations
are possible. First, somatization may only play a role in a subset of patients in our sample. In a
cohort with higher depression and anxiety scores (more typical in patients with continued
symptoms and poor recovery), for example, we might expect to see somatization as a more
robust variable. Had we therefore not excluded those participants with a prior history of
psychiatric problems it is possible that our effect sizes for the atypical symptom scores would be
higher. Second, somatization may exacerbate symptoms from the mTBI. Thus ‘typical’
symptoms may be higher due to the combination of both the organic symptoms somatization.
Third, knowledge about mTBI and past experience of concussion and its typical symptoms may
modify expectations or direct attention (somatic vigilance),38 and support symptom
misattributions. Somatization, which often coincides with these phenomena, would therefore be
more likely to produce typical ‘post-concussion’ symptoms than atypical symptoms (e.g., GI
upset) in individuals with more extensive experience and knowledge about concussion.

This study has several limitations. It is comprised of modest sample sizes, and for this study we
inventoried symptoms at only a single point in time. As we did not query pre-injury
somatization, we cannot be sure somatization scores pre-injury were a risk factor for protracted
recovery, or whether protracted recovery led to higher somatization scores. Future research is
required in order to determine whether somatoform pathology is a cause or consequence of
persistent symptoms after mTBI. Further, we examined somatic symptoms using the PHQ-15, a
proxy for examining somatization. While the PHQ-15 has moderate-to-good accuracy for
diagnosing somatization, the gold standard for diagnosing somatoform illness is a physician
administered structured interview based on the DSM-V. Finally, as our samples were recruited
cross-sectionally and immediately post-injury, and we did not take a history of somatic
symptoms prior to injury, we were unable to determine whether somatic symptoms were present
before, or appeared de novo following injury.
In contrast, the greatest strength of this study was that our work occurred in two phases, first as a
cross-sectional pilot study followed by a prospectively recruited validation cohort which
confirmed the findings of our cross-sectional study. Second, we specifically excluded individuals
with diagnosed psychiatric illness, which helped to control for more serious depressive or
anxiety symptoms that may influence somatization processes separately from mTBI.
In summary, we present evidence for higher somatic symptoms which are atypical to mTBI in
individuals with poor recovery from mTBI, when compared with healthy controls and those with
good recovery. While we found higher typical mTBI somatic symptoms in those with poor
recovery – as would be anticipated – we also found a significantly higher severity of somatic
symptoms which were atypical of mTBI in individuals with poor recovery from mTBI. Though
future research is needed, these results provide evidence that somatization may be a significant
contributor to persistent symptomology following mTBI and highlight a need to
comprehensively assess somatofom pathology as a part of mTBI care.
