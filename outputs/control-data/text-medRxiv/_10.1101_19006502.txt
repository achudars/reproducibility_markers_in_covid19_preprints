Abstract
Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is one of several neglected tropical
diseases that is targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization. Recent
years have seen a substantial decline in the number of globally reported cases, largely
driven by an intensive process of screening and treatment. However, this infection is
highly focal, continuing to persist at low prevalence even in small populations. Regional
elimination, and ultimately global eradication, rests on understanding the dynamics and
persistence of this infection at the local population scale. Here we develop a stochastic
model of gHAT dynamics, which is underpinned by screening and reporting data from
one of the highest gHAT incidence regions, Kwilu Province, in the Democratic Republic
of Congo. We use this model to explore the persistence of gHAT in villages of different
population sizes and subject to different patterns of screening. Our models demonstrate
that infection is expected to persist for long periods even in relatively small isolated
populations. We further use the model to assess the risk of recrudescence following local
elimination and consider how failing to detect cases during active screening events
informs the probability of elimination. These quantitative results provide insights for
public health policy in the region, particularly highlighting the difficulties in achieving
and measuring the 2030 elimination goal.

Author summary
Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a vector-borne infectious disease
that causes sleeping sickness across many African countries. Reported gHAT cases show
a continued decline, but it is unclear if this is sufficient to reach the WHO goal of
stopping transmission by 2030. We develop a stochastic model necessary to address the
critical question of persistence of gHAT infection at the local-scale. In contrast to other
commonly studied infections, we predict long-term persistence of gHAT in small
populations (< 1, 000 people) despite very low prevalence. Our local-scale predictions
(together with previous larger-scale studies) suggest that, to achieve regional
elimination, controls need to be widespread and intensified in the worst affected regions,
while the movement of infected people could rapidly lead to re-emergence.

Introduction

1

Gambiense sleeping sickness (gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, referred to
here as gHAT) is a tsetse-borne neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the
parasitic protozoa, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. There has recently been a decline in
global cases, with just 1,420 cases reported in 2017, compared to 10,466 reported in
2007 [1]. This decline is largely attributed to improvements in the active screening and
treatment campaigns that have been carried out in many regions [2]. In 2012, the World
Health Organization (WHO) set targets for elimination of gHAT as a public health
problem; these were updated in 2017 to: reducing the area at risk of reporting more
than 1 case per 10,000 people per year by 90% as compared to the baseline for
2000–2004 [2], and for fewer than 2,000 reported cases per year, by 2020 [3]. There is
also a more stringent goal of stopping transmission of gHAT by 2030 [3].
Cases of gHAT primarily occur in West and Central Africa, but the distribution of
infection is heterogeneous, with highly clustered incidence resulting in disease foci [4, 5];
reported prevalence often varies greatly over short distances, even between neighbouring
villages [6]. This local variation suggests there is a complex spatial structure to the
infection. With the observed global decline in reported cases and with many (but not
all) foci likely to achieve less than 1 case per 10,000 people by 2020 [7, 8], it is
increasingly important to understand both where the disease is most likely to persist
and why this might be the case.
In regions where gHAT cases are no longer observed (and where local elimination
has been achieved), it is possible for the disease to be re-introduced through movement
of either infected humans or infected tsetse, and it may become re-established especially
if active case-finding has not been maintained [9]. It is therefore clear that, while the
current active screening is highly successful in many regions, an understanding of
stochastic re-invasion and re-establishment in local populations is also essential to guide
post-elimination policy planning.
There are two stages of gHAT, with Stage 1 following initial infection and Stage 2
defined after trypanosomes have crossed the blood–brain barrier [10]; these stages
currently require very different treatments. Patients are hospitalised for the treatment
duration and are advised to recover at home afterwards, on average, for a total time of 6
months [11]. Without the treatment, individuals typically progress from Stage 1 to
Stage 2 after 18 months and most would likely be expected to die from
meningoencephalitis after approximately 3 years [12].
Active detection of gHAT occurs through population-level screening, which is
implemented in many endemic regions by mobile teams travelling to settlements and
testing the available population [6]. Teams are generally able to screen substantial
proportions of the local population (often over 70%) [13]; however, some
socio-demographic groups (notably working adult males) frequently do not present for
testing. Previous work has indicated that the individuals missed in screening are also
more likely to be more highly exposed to tsetse bites [14, 15], potentially due to working
in tsetse-infested forested and riverine areas. Such high risk core-group individuals pose
a barrier to elimination [8, 16–18]. In parallel with active screening, passive detection
occurs when individuals voluntarily attend medical facilities for testing, usually after
the onset of more significant symptoms, and are thus most often in Stage 2 of the
disease [11].
Mathematical models of gHAT have been beneficial in identifying the effectiveness of
differing control strategies and predicting when elimination is likely to occur [19].
However, much of the modelling work on the gHAT infection dynamics has been done in
large populations using deterministic models, either for an entire regional infection focus
or at a health zone level (approximately 100,000 people) [8, 15, 17, 20, 21]. Here we
translate the deterministic model of Rock et al. [17] to a stochastic framework, designed

to capture the infection dynamics and chance extinction at the village-scale. As such,
our model is mechanistic and so captures details of the biology and epidemiology,
allowing modification of model components to predict a number of different scenarios
and control options.
Much of the previous work on the stochastic persistence of infection has tended to
focus on measles in developed countries [22, 23]. Measles is directly transmissible, has a
high reproductive ratio (12–18 compared to approximately 1–1.1 for gHAT [1]) and a
high incidence before immunisation programs were introduced; yet, in contrast to gHAT,
measles only persists in large populations of above approximately 300,000 and even then
relies on frequent reintroductions [22, 23].
We use our model to address the dynamics of gHAT in the villages within the
Yasa-Bonga and Mosango health zones of the DRC (Fig 1); a region that has an
extremely high incidence of gHAT. The model has already been fitted to the available
epidemiological data from the WHO HAT Atlas (Fig 1) [7, 13], with parameters inferred
from regional reporting patterns and screening mimicking observed village-scale records
(see Methods and S1 Appendix).

Data

70

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has the highest burden of gHAT cases (1,110
cases out of 1,420 reported globally in 2017 [1]), and 46% of these cases are
concentrated in the former Bandundu province [24]. We focus on models and data for
two high-prevalence health zones in this former province (now in Kwilu province):
Yasa-Bonga and Mosango. Reported case information made available by the WHO HAT
Atlas [7, 13] details the locations of settlements with estimates of population size, the
years that active screenings took place, the number of people screened and the resulting
newly identified gHAT cases. In Yasa-Bonga and Mosango, we consider 559 settlements,
which experienced 2,701 active screenings in 2000–2012, each where a full village
population was targeted to be screened, resulting in 4,875 detected gHAT cases, as well
as 2,496 additional cases from detected by passive surveillance. Our model utilises these
recorded screening patterns to simulate interventions, while the active and passive cases
detected in each settlement are stochastically generated by the model.
Population sizes for settlements are also obtained from census estimates within the
WHO HAT Atlas (Fig 1B) [7, 13]; we account for an estimated yearly population growth
of 2.6% [25]. Screening coverage from active surveillance is then calculated as the
number of individuals screened divided by this population estimate in each year.
Annual screenings larger than the estimated accessible population (yellow and red bars
in Fig 1D) may indicate either multiple screenings in a year or misreporting of
individuals attending from neighbouring settlements. Low annual screening coverage (at
less than 20% of the population size, gray bars in Fig 1D) is assumed to represent
individuals screened outside their home settlement and therefore is not considered as a
complete active screening of any given village.
All relevant model data are displayed within the paper and the Supporting
Information files (S1 Appendix, Table S2). Epidemiological data for the study were
provided by the WHO in the frame of the Atlas of gHAT which may be viewed at

(using the formulation of Model 4 from that study) (S1 Appendix, Fig S1). The model
captures a population of humans, which is initially partitioned into those at high and
low risk of being exposed to tsetse bites. Each person will transition between five
different epidemiological compartments: susceptible; exposed (or latent); Stage 1
infection; Stage 2 infection; and hospitalised (and temporarily removed). We assume
that there is natural mortality from all compartments, which leads to replacement of
that individual as a susceptible in the population.
The risk structure is used to capture the behaviour of the small proportion of
individuals that both work in the habitat of many tsetse and so have a higher biting
exposure and also do not partake in active screening, thereby acting as a human
reservoir of infection [16–18]. The proportion of the individuals in the high risk group is
estimated through extensive model fitting to be 7.6% of the population for these health
zones [17]. While the high risk group have a higher biting exposure, the probability of
tsetse infection per single infective bite is the same for both risk groups. This model
structure, where individuals are either high risk and non-participating in active
screening or low risk and randomly participating in active screening, was selected using
the deviance information criterion (DIC), which assigns low scores for models with high
posterior mean log-likelihood and penalises models with more parameters.
Tsetse in the model are similarly compartmentalised into four epidemiological states:
teneral (unfed); non-teneral yet uninfected; exposed (or latent); and infected. The
distinction between teneral and non-teneral yet uninfected is used to capture the
observation that tsetse are far more susceptible to infection at their first blood meal
than at any subsequent blood meals [30]. The effect of a possible animal reservoir is not
considered, since its role remains unclear [15, 17, 20, 31, 42] and its inclusion does not
significantly improve the match between model outputs and currently available data in
this setting [17].
Additional to the epidemiological and demographic processes, we simulate the effect
of active screening and passive detection of cases. Passive detection (and
disease-induced mortality) is assumed to occur at a fixed (per capita) rate for all Stage 2
infected individuals [11]. Active screening takes place annually; the proportion screened
is either replayed from the historic pattern for that settlement or chosen randomly from
the set of all screening coverages recorded, allowing a greater range of scenarios to be
explored. Since Yasa-Bonga and Mosango are high endemicity regions, we assume that
the screening coverage and frequency remains constant over time but note that these
quantities are somewhat affected by population size (S1 Appendix, Fig S8).
Individuals in the low risk group are selected randomly for screening, irrespective of
epidemiological status, and those that are found to be infected are moved to the
hospitalised class. We assume that screening only applies to low risk individuals, such
that screening coverages greater than 92.4% (the estimated proportion in the low risk
group) [17] are truncated (Fig 1D). In the field, the diagnostic process is complex and
multi-stage [32]; however, in the model, we collapse this into characteristics for the
whole algorithm, which is assumed to be 91% sensitive [33] but 100% specific. False
negatives remain undetected in the settlement, but by assuming 100% specificity, there
are no false positives as we assume confirmation by microscopy will be carried out due
to the low case numbers.
For the majority of this paper, we model the dynamics as a closed population,
without emigration or immigration, so that once the disease has gone extinct in a
population it cannot be re-introduced. This removes a critical dependency in model
formulation, and greatly simplifies the presentation of results. In reality, no population
is ever completely isolated; however we show that the expected rate of infectious
imports is very low and does not affect our main results or conclusions (S1 Appendix).

Parameters

153

Model parameters for the underlying compartmental model are taken from the previous
work of Rock et al. [17]. The values of these parameters were taken from literature,
where well-defined, and otherwise inferred by model fitting using a Metropolis–Hastings
MCMC algorithm, which sought to match the deterministic model to observed cases
and screening effort in Yasa-Bonga and Mosango. The values used in this manuscript
are the median of the distributions inferred using MCMC methodology applied to the
aggregate annual data from Yasa-Bonga and Mosango. Therefore, the parameter values
are specific to the study region, and the model is well-matched with the incidence data
from active and passive surveillance. A full list of parameters is given in the S1
Appendix, Table S1.

We use our model to address the dynamics of gHAT in the villages within the
Yasa-Bonga and Mosango health zones of the DRC (Fig 1), a region that has an
extremely high incidence of gHAT. Using the estimated population sizes and the
reported levels of active screenings (Fig 1B and D), we validate the stochastic model by
comparing the observed and predicted screenings that did not detect any cases (which
subsumes both local extinction and failure to detect). We then consider the probability
of local gHAT persistence across a range of population sizes and different control
scenarios, as well as the probability of re-invasion. Finally, we focus on whether not
detecting cases in a series of active screens can inform on whether local elimination has
been achieved, noting that WHO guidelines suggest annual active screenings until there
have been three consecutive years of no new cases, followed by a further screening with
no cases after three years [32].

While the underlying deterministic model has been fitted to the aggregate data from
this region, it is important to assess the behaviour of the stochastic model against
village-scale observations. Unfortunately, local disease extinctions cannot be directly
observed; failure to discover any cases does not necessarily mean that the infection is
not present, simply that it has not been detected. Thus, to validate our model, we make
comparisons between the simulated predictions and WHO HAT Atlas data [7, 13] for the
probability of detecting no cases on an active screening (termed zero-detections for
brevity), which is a combination of failure to detect and local extinction. We compare
model predictions to observations by calculating the percentage of zero-detections in
aggregations of 100 active screenings with similar village population sizes (Fig 2A). We
find very strong agreement between model predictions and data, with a pronounced
decline in zero-detections for larger populations.
For individual settlements, those where the number of zero-detections lie outside the
95th percentile of model predictions are notably spatially clustered (Fig 2B). In 2.1% of
settlements (red), there are significantly fewer zero-detections than predicted and hence
greater persistence; these villages are generally localised around the main river through
the region. In 6.3% of settlements there are significantly more zero-detections than
expected (yellow), and these are clustered far from the major rivers and in upland areas.
Since tsetse are most densely distributed surrounding riverine areas [34], this spatial
clustering may indicate the need for spatially heterogeneous parameters that reflect the
suitability of the local environment for tsetse. However, given that more than 90% of
villages fall within our prediction intervals, we believe the homogeneous parameters
capture the general stochastic behaviour of this region.

Local gHAT persistence

201

Local gHAT persistence, where human infection is maintained in a settlement, is
affected by many factors (Fig 3), including the population size of the settlement; the
vector-to-host (tsetse-to-human) ratio; the exposure to the tsetse; the screening
procedure; and any movement of infected individuals between populations. We calculate
the probability of persistence by stochastically simulating the epidemic for 16 years
from the endemic (uncontrolled) disease equilibrium. If there is zero gHAT infection in
the human population after a given number of years and no further human infection
emerges in the following year from infected tsetse, we say in this simulation there is
local disease elimination with no immediate threat of re-emergence (Fig 4A provides a
justification for this criteria). This procedure is repeated for multiple population sizes;
the proportion of simulations that retain infection after a given number of years
determines the probability of persistence (Fig 3).
We focus on settlements with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants, typical of Yasa-Bonga
and Mosango (Fig 1B), and use regionally specific parameters. In all scenarios
investigated, we find that persistence increases with increasing population size (Fig 3).
This echoes results from other infections [22, 23, 35, 36], where small populations with
low incidence experience a greater impact of stochasticity and chains of transmission
that are more likely to be broken. In addition, given that long-term persistence relies on

Fig 3. Predicted probability of gHAT persistence in isolated settlements.
Simulations are started at the endemic (uncontrolled) equilibrium and iterated forwards
(without infectious imports), while the persistence of infection is recorded. This is
repeated 100,000 times for settlement population sizes between 50 and 2,000 individuals.
The expected number of yearly new infections if the system were at equilibrium is
proportional to the population size and is given by the top scale. (A) Impact of active
screening on gHAT persistence; annual screening at a fixed coverage per year yields a
drop in persistence with increased coverage. (B) Comparison of screening assumptions
on the persistence of gHAT. The solid curve shows results where annual screening
coverages were randomly sampled from all observed coverages; dots represent the
individual settlements recorded in the WHO HAT Atlas for Yasa-Bonga and Mosango
health zones [7, 13], where the reported coverage in each year is used. There were
sufficient simulations such that confidence intervals are too small to be visible.
persistence for shorter time intervals, the probability of persistence decreases with time
(S1 Appendix, Fig S9B–C). The relatively long persistence times of gHAT, compared to
the frequently studied persistence of childhood diseases [22, 23], are attributable to the
long time-scale of gHAT infection in the absence of active interventions [37].
The addition of active screening (leading to the treatment of detected cases)
decreases the probability of persistence across all population sizes, since removing
infected individuals leads to a greater chance of breaking chains of transmission
(Fig 3A). Increasing levels of screening, beyond the observed 21% average, leads to
further reductions for persistence. We compare three assumptions for active screening
(Fig 3B): that each population is screened annually at a fixed coverage equal to the
regional average (21%); that each population experiences screening coverages sampled
from the regional pattern including not screening in a given year; and simply replaying
the recorded pattern of active screening in each village. Despite the very different
distributions of screening effort, all three of these assumptions produce comparable
levels of persistence.

Following localised elimination of infection, populations remain vulnerable to re-invasion;
we investigate the potential for re-establishment of sustained transmission in a

when starting at the endemic level in these vectors (Fig 4A). In approximately 65% of
simulations, the initially infected tsetse generate human cases, and the level of infection
in vectors rapidly plateaus; otherwise, infection is eliminated from the location within
six months due to short vector life expectancies in comparison to the human hosts. This
validates the previous simulation assumption (Fig 3) that local disease elimination can
be considered achieved after a period of one year in which there are no infected humans,
as the number of infected tsetse will also become negligible.
The probability that a population of tsetse, infected at the endemic equilibrium
(0.02% of tsetse exposed or infected), will lead to re-establishment of infection is
predicted to be a function of settlement size (S1 Appendix, Fig S10A). Small
populations are unlikely to see any new human infections, and those that are generated
fail to persist. However, even for large population sizes of 2,000 individuals, the chance
of continued transmission beyond one year is only 55% and is less than 10% over 15
years. For lower levels of infection in the tsetse population, the risk of successful
re-establishment is proportionally reduced.
In contrast, if re-invasion of an infection-free population is due to the movement of
an infected person into the settlement (in the absence of infected tsetse) the probability
of re-establishment over different time-frames is largely unaffected by the population
size (Fig 4B). We predict a high probability (> 70%) of short term re-invasion, but a
more limited chance (< 20%) that this will generate persistent infection for 15 years or
more. This is typical of stochastic dynamics of infection with low basic reproductive
ratio (R0 ), where, although short chains of transmission are likely, it is difficult for the
infection to fully establish.

Fig 4. Dynamics of extinction and reintroduction. (A) Starting with no
infected humans but the tsetse population at its endemic equilibrium and a settlement
size of 1,000 individuals, the model predicts a dramatic decline in the infected tsetse
population, depending on whether subsequent human cases are generated by the
infected tsetse. (B) Extending this model further for a range of initial conditions, we
examine the probability that at least one human case is generated and the infection
persists for a given time, when starting with one infected human and no infected tsetse
for both uncontrolled and random screening.

Detecting elimination

263

As discussed above, zero-detections may be an indication that there is no infection in a
settlement; however, it may simply be that infected individuals were not screened or
were false negatives. Despite this, there is a temptation to associate zero-detection with
zero infection; we therefore use our simulations to tease apart this complex relationship.
The model replays the observed pattern of screening in each settlement, but we perform
multiple simulations to ascertain the probability that infection has been locally
eliminated following one, two or three consecutive zero-detection screenings, in which at
least 20% of the population are screened (Fig 5). We also insist that no passive cases
were detected between the screening events. Our standard assumption, in agreement
with parameter inference for this region, is that 26% of Stage 2 infections, where people
either self-report or likely die of gHAT infection, are detected and reported [17], but we
also investigate 0% (no passive reporting) and 100% (all passive cases and deaths are
reported) for comparison.
For small settlements, given that long-term persistence is unlikely (Fig 3), even a
single zero-detection screen (Fig 5, blue) is frequently associated with local elimination.
For larger populations, a single zero-detection has limited predictive power, and three
consecutive zero-detections are needed to have any degree of confidence, in which case
the reporting of passive cases plays a noticeable role. There is, however, significant
variation between settlements, reflecting very different patterns of reported screening.
Moderate population sizes of between 200 and 1,000 individuals show extreme variation
in the ability to predict local elimination, while smaller villages have less variation, in
part due to rarely being screened before 2009 (S1 Appendix, Fig S8C).

Regional persistence relies on more than independent persistence in individual
settlements. It is likely that the occasional movements of infected people lead to a
stochastic meta-population paradigm [41], where rare local extinctions of infection are
balanced by external imports. However, the agreement between model and data (Fig 2),
together with the low prevalence of infection, indicates that imports are likely to be rare.
We make this more quantitative by fitting an importation rate of infection,
proportional to the size of the population. Before interventions, the presence/absence of
infection in a population reflects the equilibrium balance between extinction and
re-colonisation; we can therefore use the presence of infection at the first recorded active
screening within a village as measure of the equilibrium state. Fitting the external
importation rate to the probability of detecting infection in a village at the first active
screen gives the best fit when the rate is small at just 3.4 × 10−6 per person per day
(Fig 6A). Moreover, it is assumed that the importation rate declines over time as the
overall prevalence in DRC reduces.
For most population sizes in the region, the expected time to importation is
therefore relatively long (Fig 6B), and in many cases a single importation will not cause
further transmission events (Fig 4), leading us to conclude that in general the level of
importation will not qualitatively change our results. This is made more explicit in the
supporting information (S1 Appendix, Fig S6), where it is shown that the model with
the fitted level of infectious imports generates comparable results to those described in
the main paper. This justifies our modelling assumptions that villages act as isolated
populations and that importation of infection is unlikely to perturb the dynamics;
instead, we are able to separate the processes of local elimination and re-invasion.

Fig 5. Probability of elimination in a settlement, given consecutive
zero-detections with no detected passive cases. (A) Consecutive zero-detections
means consecutive in the observed years of screenings, not necessarily in consecutive
years, and with no passive cases detected in between. Each point represents the average
from multiple simulations of individual settlements where the reported pattern of
screenings is replayed. The points and solid lines assume a reporting rate of 26% [17],
while the dashed and dotted lines show reporting rates of 0% and 100%, respectively.
Sufficient simulations are used such that the confidence intervals are small
(unobservable on the scale of this graph). Lines represent a weighted local regression fit.
Active screenings where fewer than 20% of the population are assessed are excluded
from our analysis due to the small sample sizes (alternative cut-offs of less than 10%
and less than 50% are presented in the S1 Appendix, Fig S12).

Discussion

310

Despite global declines in reported cases over the last decades, gambiense gHAT
remains a problem in many focal areas [38]. These regions, concentrated primarily in
the DRC, represent a significant challenge to achieving the WHO 2020 and 2030 goals
of elimination as a public health problem and zero transmission, respectively. Robust
models, matched to the available data, are the only viable means of quantitatively
assessing future dynamics and the long-term impact of controls [8, 17, 18, 21]. Active
screening followed by treatment is one of the main control measures, but this action is
deployed at the village level suggesting that village-scale models (which recognise the
effects of small population size) may be needed to optimise deployment; these results
can then be scaled to an infection focus or national level to measure regional
elimination, which is especially important as we approach zero transmission.
We have introduced a dynamic, mechanistic, stochastic gHAT model, which is
applied to 559 settlements in the Yasa-Bonga and Mosango health zones within the
former Bandundu province of the DRC (Fig 1). Using parameters inferred from a
deterministic model fitted to aggregated reported cases, our model reliably captures
observed detection patterns at the village-scale (Fig 2). This comparison highlighted
some spatial heterogeneity associated with the local environmental conditions
(significantly fewer zero-detections than predicted occurred in regions close to large
rivers, where the tsetse density is presumably high); however, 91.6% of settlements fell
within the model (95%) prediction intervals, giving us confidence in our predictive
ability. The inclusion of such local environmental factors, which modify the underlying

Fig 6. Simulating external importations of infection into village
populations. (A) By running simulations with different values for the external
infection parameter, we find the best fit — to data binned by population size from the
WHO HAT Atlas on whether there are any detected cases on the first active screening —
is when imports per susceptible individual are equal to 3.4 × 10−6 days−1 (solid line).

parameters, is clearly an area for further research into refining this small-scale model
and may help to practically focus localised control measures, in particular for planning
tsetse control.
Throughout our simulation experiments, we consistently find that gHAT persists
better in larger populations. This is as expected and agrees with theoretical work and
analysis of other diseases [22, 23, 35, 36, 39, 40]; in small populations, the behaviour of the
individual is more important, and hence stochastic effects are magnified. The degree of
persistence predicted is, however, surprising; settlements of around 2,000 inhabitants,
where yearly incidence is only 13 new infections, frequently persist for 15 years or more
(Fig 3). This should be contrasted with frequently studied, highly transmissible diseases,
such as measles, where local extinctions are common in population sizes of less than
300,000 [22, 23]. We attribute this pronounced difference to the much longer time scales
associated with gHAT, meaning single individuals can maintain infection, and the
vector-borne nature of gHAT transmission, such that the tsetse act as a short-lived
reservoir. We consistently find that incorporating active screening reduces the
persistence of infection (Fig 3A), although the distribution of screening across years has
only a small effect (Fig 3B). Increasing the screening coverage beyond the average
reported levels (of 21% per year) is predicted to lead to further reductions in
persistence, but infection is still predicted to be maintained for over 15 years in many
larger populations.
Throughout, we have generally ignored the impact of new infectious individuals
entering the population, and indeed have shown that this rate of importation is very
low. If re-invasion following local elimination is due to the movement of a single infected
individual into the settlement (Fig 4B), we predict that the probability of subsequent
cases is high (70–80%) and largely independent of population size. However, only a
small proportion (10–20%) of such invasions lead to long-term persistence of over 15

years. Re-establishment of infection due to the movement of a limited number of
infected tsetse is even less likely. Current uncertainties about the impact of potential
reservoirs — either a human reservoir of asymptomatic infections or an animal reservoir
— mean there is insufficient knowledge for resurgence to be explicitly modelled by these
mechanisms [42], but an animal reservoir that can maintain infection in the absence of
humans is likely to represent a worst-case scenario.
A key question, as we approach the 2030 goal of zero transmission, is to ascertain
when local elimination has been achieved, allowing policy-makers to scale back control if
the infection is no longer present. Due to only a limited proportion of each settlement
being screened and the potential for false negatives, a screening can fail to detect any
cases even when there is infection in the population. We have shown that, while a single
zero-detection screening provides relatively little information of the probability of local
gHAT elimination, multiple consecutive zero-detection screenings are a strong indicator
of elimination (Fig 5). This can be further strengthened if only large screens (> 50%)
are included in the analysis (S1 Appendix, Fig S12B), providing valuable public health
information. This concurs with WHO guidelines for active screenings, as villages are no
longer considered in planning by mobile screening teams after three consecutive years of
zero-detections, followed by a further zero-detection after three years [32]; our model
would predict local elimination with large probability for this level of surveillance.
Consistent with the observed patterns in high endemicity regions, we have assumed that
the screening coverage and frequency remains constant over these time scales but note
that in other regions it may be important to consider the reduction in active screening
as reported gHAT cases decline and elimination is approached.

The ability to capture the stochastic dynamics and persistence of gambiense gHAT
infection at the village-scale is a major advance in public health modelling, with
far-reaching consequences for informing policy decisions. This is particularly pertinent
as our models operate at the same spatial scale as controls and can capture the local
elimination of infection that is a prerequisite of achieving the 2030 goal of zero
transmission globally.

We introduce a compartmental infection model for HAT. The outputs of the model are
the number of humans and the proportion of the total number of vectors in each class.
For humans, the classes are: susceptible, exposed (but not infectious), Stage 1 infection,
Stage 2 infection and hospitalised (or recovering at home). These variables are denoted
by SHj (t), EHj (t), I1Hj (t), I2Hj (t) and RHj (t), where j = 1, 2, with j = 1 for low risk
individuals, randomly participating in active screening, and j = 2 for high risk
individuals, never participating in active screening, each at time t > 0. The population
size is assumed to be constant and thus

The vectors (tsetse) are given by the variables SV , E1V , E2V , E3V , IV and GV ,
which correspond to teneral (unfed) tsetse, infected tsetse in their extrinsic incubation
period (there are three classes to create a gamma distributed period), infectious tsetse,
and non-teneral (fed) but uninfected tsetse. The compartments of the model and
possible transitions between them are shown graphically in Fig. S1. We assume that
there is natural mortality from all compartments, which leads to replacement of that
individual as a susceptible in the population.
Active screening has the potential to detect infection and so move individuals from
the exposed or infected classes directly to hospitalised. This is simulated by randomly
selecting from the low risk population and if these individuals are exposed or infected,
they become hospitalised with 91% probability (the sensitivity of the screening
algorithm), as this is the probability of a positive test result, given the person has the
infection.

rates remain the same in the human population, but now, since we are considering an
infinite number of vectors, an ordinary differential equation approximation is used to
describe the vectors. In simulating the model, the tau-leaping algorithm is used,
whereby the states and rates are updated with a fixed time step at which the ordinary
differential equations are also updated.
In our analysis, the endemic disease equilibrium is calculated as the steady state of
the deterministic model, excluding control measures other than basic passive
surveillance [1]. Initial conditions for individual villages are taken by sampling from a
binomial distribution, where the probability of being selected in a class is given by the
proportion in that class in the steady state of the model. Using random initial
conditions with the mean at endemic equilibrium removes the effects of rounding the
initial conditions to the same integer values for each simulation.
A sample realisation of the infection dynamics in a population with three active
screening events, where randomly sampled infected low risk individuals are moved
directly into the hospitalised class, is shown in Figure S2.
Parameters
Table S2 defines the parameters used in the model for HAT infection dynamics. These
parameter values are taken from Rock et al. [1], which were either sourced from
literature, where well-defined, or otherwise (in the case of meff , R1 , R2 , r and u) taken
as the median of the distribution obtained by model fitting using a Metropolis–Hastings
MCMC algorithm that matched the deterministic version of the model to incidence data
from the WHO HAT Atlas.
Since the human population is partitioned into low and high risk individuals, we also
denote NH1 = NH R1 and NH2 = NH R2 , where R1 + R2 = 1. Similarly,
fH1 = fH R1 /(R1 + rR2 ) and fH2 = fH rR2 /(R1 + rR2 ) to give the proportion of blood
meals on each of the two risk groups, which sum to the total proportion of blood meals
tsetse take on humans, fH . Furthermore, we note that the effective density of tsetse is
given by the product of the relative tsetse density and the probability of human
infection per single infective bite, meff = mpH .
Risk structure
The risk structure in the human population is included, since there is evidence for
differences in screening attendance and tsetse exposure within the population [3].
Furthermore, using deviance information criterion (DIC) as the method of model
selection, there was strong evidence for the inclusion of risk structure [1]. Figure S3
shows the comparison of the models with the reported incidence data. The marginal
improvement of the fit when an animal reservoir was added to the model meant animals
were not considered here. The DIC was calculated by the following:

DIC = −2LL θ̄ + 4Var (LL (θ)) ,
where LL is the log-likelihood of unknown parameters θ, and where θ̄ is the expectation
of these parameters.

randomly selected for active screening after three, four and nine years, respectively.
Note that the number of hospitalised individuals increases at the first two active
screening events, but no infected individuals are randomly selected and detected in the
third screening event. We only plot those infected (or affected) by HAT, although we
note that the vast majority of both populations are susceptible.

Tsetse density
One fundamental parameter of the model, the effective density of tsetse, is equal to the
product of the vector-to-host ratio and the probability of human infection per single
infective bite. In the original deterministic framework, these constituent terms did not
need to be known, as it was only the product that was important; therefore they could
not be inferred separately. However, since the stochastic model explicitly captures the
number of tsetse, the two parameters are now required. Given the limited data to
estimate either component parameter, we choose to explore the potential range of
parameters: from very high probability of infection and hence low vector-to-host ratio,
to very low probability of infection and large vector-to-host ratio such that the
dynamics of tsetse can be modelled deterministically.
Considering the simplest case in the absence of disease-control measures, we find
that different values for the vector-to-host ratio have a relatively limited impact on
predictions of disease persistence. Unsurprisingly, large tsetse populations, which can be
approximated by deterministic dynamics, lead to the greatest persistence (Fig. S4);
thus, throughout this paper, we utilise this worst-case scenario, although other
assumptions do not change the qualitative findings.

Fig S4. Impact of the parameters forming the effective density of tsetse.
When the probability of human infection per single infective bite is high the
vector-to-host ratio, V:H, is around 6.56, whereas when the probability is low, V:H
becomes large and deterministic models are valid for tsetse dynamics. The expected
number of yearly new infections for each population size, if the system were at
equilibrium, is also given by the top scale.

Isolated populations
For the majority of results in the main paper, we assume that importations of infection
between villages do not play a significant role and so treat them independently. In many
cases, such as community-level persistence, this approach is justified, as we wish to
understand the stochastic dynamics in the absence of confounding imports. We also
quantify the level of infectious imports by considering the probability of a village having
infection present on the first screening and assuming this represents a long-term
equilibrium solution, since this is the infection level before regular active screening
began. By matching the WHO HAT Atlas data to the output of the model with an
additional per person importation rate parameter (δ) we find that, using least-squares
fitting, δ ≈ 3.4 × 10−6 days−1 . This rate is small and so can be reasonably ignored on
the studied time scales, particularly as there is some probability that this importation
will not cause any subsequent transmission. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that
this importation rate will decay over time, since the total case numbers in the DRC is
reducing [11]. By fitting the reduction in total cases in the DRC to an exponential decay
function, we get a decay rate of 0.1071, which we apply to the import rate (Fig. S5).

Fig S5. Change in the importation of infection parameter in time. The
decay of the rate of importation of infection parameter is matched to the decay rate of
cases of HAT in the DRC [11].
As a validation of our assumption that importations can be safely ignored over the
time-scales of this study, we re-examine the match between active-screenings that fail to
detect cases and model results including imports (Fig. S6). This is a counter-point to
Fig. 2 in the main paper. We find that the inclusion of imports has an extremely small
difference on the model predictions: slightly improving the fit between model and data
(Fig. S6A). However, under this new model, there is now an additional village where the
model significantly predicts fewer zero-detections than observed, decreasing the
percentage of villages within the model prediction intervals to 91.4% (Fig. S6B).

Tau-leaping
Since we use a fixed step size for the tau-leaping algorithm of 0.1 days, Figure S7 shows
that the results for persistence of HAT after 15 years are qualitatively the same for time
steps of 0.01 and 1 days, so we are confident that a time step of 0.1 days is not
introducing numerical errors. 95% confidence intervals are all small, in the range
(0.0044, 0.0196) about the plotted mean values.

Data
Active screening data
In the main manuscript, we note that not all settlements undergo the same levels of
screening. In fact, larger village populations tend to have more frequent screening, but
with a lower proportion of the population tested; small populations tend to have high
coverage but infrequent screens (Fig. S8A and B). The smaller villages were also not
typically screened in 2000–2008, while villages with populations greater than 500 were
screened over the whole data period 2000–2012 (Fig. S8C). Typically, we see that 50%
of villages were screened in any given year. We do not account for any of these
differences in our analysis but can use these trends to help explain any discrepancies
between models and the data.
In addition, the active screening data from the WHO HAT Atlas were used to
calculate the mean annual screening coverage as 21%. Population sizes were taken from

the census data within the WHO HAT Atlas and then modified by assuming an annual
population growth of 2.6%. Coverages were then calculated as the number of people
screened divided by the estimated population size, assuming a maximum coverage equal
to that of the entire the low risk population size (92.4%), as described in the main
manuscript. The mean annual coverage was then obtained as the mean of these
coverages, where active screening occurred, as well as the 0% coverages, where no active
screening was recorded. This value is thus highly dependent on the quality of the census
information, as differences in population sizes will change this estimate of mean
coverage. It is therefore important to have good census data for making predictions on
the effect of different screening coverages.

Persistence and elimination
Local disease persistence
As a control strategy, we find that randomly selecting the screening coverage from all
reported coverages slightly out-performs screening annually at the mean coverage (21%),
kept fixed across all years. High levels of coverage in any one year are more likely to
interrupt transmission (Fig. S9A). In addition, long-term persistence requires continued
transmission and so the probability of persistence decreases with time (Fig. S9B and C).

Re-invasion due to tsetse
We consider the dynamics of re-invasion, given different initial conditions to Figure 4 in
the main manuscript. In a population without human infections but with endemic levels
of tsetse infection, the chance that any human cases will be generated increases with
settlement size (Fig. S10A). This is due to tsetse being able to interact with fewer
humans over their short lifespan, while new transmission events caused by human
infection are less dependent on population size, as the infection will be present in the
population for much longer. The probability of new transmission events is further
increased by the addition of an infected human to endemic levels of tsetse infection (Fig.
S10B).

Proportion of positive tests in a screening
Comparing the data on the proportion of tests that result in a positive detection of
HAT to the output of the model demonstrates similar results to comparing the
screenings with no detected cases, as in Figure 2 from the main manuscript (Fig. S11).
The difference in coverages of an active screening event mean the results have more
variation than simply not detecting any new cases, yet the model is similarly capturing
the behaviour seen in the data; there are a few more settlements that stand out as
significantly different from the model (69 settlements, 12.3%), but these are similarly
clustered where expected.
Definition of a full screen
In calculating the probability of infection on detecting no cases, a zero-detection event is
different for different screening percentages. We use 20% of the population screened to
define a ‘full screening’; however, similar results are achieved for the screening regime of
Yasa-Bonga and Mosango 2000–2012 when 10% is used. If 50% is used, and so all
screenings are of reasonable quality, there is more confidence that the same number of
consecutive zero screenings are a proxy for no infection in the population (Fig. S12).
