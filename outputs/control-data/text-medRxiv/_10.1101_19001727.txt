Abstract: Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is associated with a wide range of physiological
changes due, in part, to the influence of hypoxemia during sleep. We studied gene expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells in association with three measures of SDB: Apnea Hypopnea
Index (AHI); average oxyhemoglobin saturation (avgO2) during sleep; and minimum
oxyhemoglobin saturation (minO2) during sleep. We performed discovery association analysis in
two community-based studies, the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS; N=571) and the MultiEthnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 580). An association with false discovery rate
(FDR) q < 0.05 in one study was considered “replicated” if a p < 0.05 was observed in the other
study. Those genes that replicated across MESA and FOS, or with FDR q < 0.05 in metaanalysis, were used for analysis of gene expression in the blood of 15 participants from the Heart
Biomarkers In Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) trial. HeartBEAT participants had moderate or
severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and were studied pre- and post-treatment (three months)
with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We also performed Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) on all traits and cohort analyses. Twenty-two genes were associated with SDB
traits in both MESA and FOS. Of these, lower expression of CD1D and RAB20 was associated
with lower avgO2 in MESA and FOS. CPAP treatment increased the expression of these genes
in HeartBEAT participants. Immunity and inflammation pathways were up-regulated in subjects
with lower avgO2; i.e., in those with a more severe SDB phenotype (MESA), whereas immunoinflammatory processes were down-regulated in response to CPAP treatment (HeartBEAT).

Introduction
Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep
and is usually associated with impaired gas exchange. The most common type, Obstructive Sleep
Apnea (OSA), is estimated to be prevalent in 17% of women and 34% of men, aged 30-70 years
(1), and contributes significantly to the incidence and morbidity of cardio-metabolic disease,
including hypertension, stroke, heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and
diabetes (2-8). OSA is characterized by episodic complete (apneas) or partial (hypopneas)
cessation of breathing during sleep, resulting in intermittent hypercapnic hypoxemia. Hypoxemia,
particularly in the presence of hypercapnia, leads to both acute and persistent increases in
sympathetic nervous system activity (9) that persists during wakefulness (10, 11) and contributes
to elevated blood pressure. The arousal that typically occurs at the termination of apneas and
hypopneas further increases sympathetic activity. Intermittent hypoxemia is also implicated in
systemic inflammation and oxidative stress that further increases risk for cardio-metabolic disease
(12-14). The molecular mechanisms underlying OSA-mediated physiological stress are not well
established, but include genetic and gene regulatory factors.

Genome-wide gene expression analysis is a powerful tool for identifying molecular mechanisms
underlying complex traits (15-17). Hypoxemia is known to influence gene expression, partly by
affecting transcription factor activation, including both HIF-1α and NF-κB (18); therefore, the
impact of OSA on gene expression, and particularly that of inflammatory genes, is anticipated.
Although gene expression profiles may differ across tissues (19), intermittent hypoxemia has been
shown to affect gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers (20).
Currently, studies of gene expression in OSA (or SDB) are limited. Five studies ranging in size

from 18 to 48 individuals have evaluated the impact of OSA on gene expression in peripheral
blood monocytes or total leukocytes, either cross-sectionally in comparison to those without OSA
(20-22), or pre- and post-treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (23, 24), the
most common therapy for OSA. These small studies had limited power to detect significant
expression differences (or changes with treatment) in individual genes, although pathway analysis
suggested possible involvement of inflammatory, cell cycle, and neoplastic pathways (23). In
addition to their small sample size, some studies targeted a specific patient population (e.g.,
children) (22) or a limited set of genes (21), and generally focused on dichotomized
(presence/absence) OSA traits. Larger sample sizes and analysis of quantitative OSA trait values
are important to increase statistical power, enhance generalizability of the results, and provide
insight into which aspects of OSA may be responsible for observed effects on gene expression.
Complementary analyses that address causality are needed to overcome confounding that may be
present in observational studies.

To address these gaps in knowledge, we conducted the largest analysis to date of genome-wide
transcriptional associations with multiple traits that characterize different aspects of SDB: the
apnea hypopnea index (AHI) as well as the average and the minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation
during sleep (avgO2 and minO2, respectively). We analyzed this large, population-based
peripheral blood transcriptomics data set in relation to SDB phenotypes using two complementary
approaches with respect to: gene-focused analysis with cross validation, and pathway-based
methods. For the gene-focused approach, we first performed a discovery association analysis of
gene expression in two population-based cohorts: the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS, (25))
and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, (26)). Second, we further evaluated genes

identified in the discovery study using fifteen individuals from the Heart Biomarkers in Apnea
Treatment (HeartBEAT) clinical trial (27). These subjects had moderate to severe OSA and were
adherent to CPAP for three months. In the pathway-based approach, we performed Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in each of these cohorts to determine those processes that are
associated with distinct SDB traits and, in the case of HeartBEAT, we assessed the effect of OSA

Materials and Methods
The central study design is illustrated in Fig. 1. We start with a single-gene association discovery
step, in which we studied the association of gene-expression with SDB traits in two discovery
cohorts: the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
(MESA). First, we performed association analysis in each of FOS and MESA separately, and
tested for replication of gene expression associations in the second study (cross-replication),
following the standard in genetic analysis for replication as a gold standard for limiting false
discoveries. Then, to increase power, we meta-analyzed estimated associations across FOS and
MESA. Finally, we took genes that either cross-replicated between FOS and MESA or were

detected in their meta-analysis and studied where the expression of these genes responds to
CPAP treatment in the HeartBEAT clinical study.

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)
MESA is a longitudinal cohort study, established in 2000, that prospectively collected risk factors
for development of cardiovascular disease among participants in six field centers across the United
States (Baltimore City and Baltimore County, MD; Chicago, IL; Forsyth County, NC; Los Angeles
County, CA; Northern Manhattan and the Bronx, NY; and St. Paul, MN). The cohort has been
studied every few years. For the present analysis, we consider N = 619 individuals who participated
in a sleep study (28, 29) and had available gene expression data. Blood for gene expression was
drawn during the Exam 5 core examination (2010-2012) and sleep studies were conducted in an
ancillary exam (2010-2013). Blood collection and monocyte sample purification were performed
sequentially using sodium heparin-containing Vacutainer CPTTM cell separation tubes (Becton
Dickinson, Rutherford, NJ, USA) and anti-CD14-coated magnetic beads, using an AutoMACs
automated magnetic separation unit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), as detailed
before (30). Sleep data were collected using standardized full in-home level-2 polysomnography
(Compumedics Somte Systems, Abbotsville, Australia, AU0), as described before (29). After
removal of 39 observations due to missing sleep data, we included 580 participants in the analysis:
196 African-Americans (AA), 259 European-Americans (EA) and 125 Hispanic-Europeans (HA).

Gene expression data collection and processing in MESA
Gene expression profiling in MESA was described in Liu et al (30). Briefly, peripheral blood
samples of 1,264 randomly selected MESA participants from four MESA field centers (Baltimore,

MD; Forsyth County, NC; New York, NY; and St Paul, MN) were obtained during the fifth
examination, and mononuclear cells were isolated with consistent purity of > 90%. Blood was
drawn in the morning following 8 hours fast. Extracted RNA that passed Quality Control (QC)
testing was reversely transcribed, amplified and subjected to global expression microarrays. Global
expression quantification was measured by Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip and
Illumina Bead Array Reader. Samples were assigned to chips via stratified random sampling to
prevent potential batch, chip, and position biases. Gene expression data underwent pre-processing,
QC, and normalization, in steps including local background correction, elimination of probes not
satisfying QC criteria, and normal-exponential convolution model. This was done using a series
of Bioconductor packages (beadarray, limma etc) and Illumina software GenomeStudio. These
steps resulted in gene expression data for 14,619 transcripts for further statistical analysis.

Association analyses in MESA
We fit linear mixed models separately in each race/ethnic group to estimate the association
between SDB exposures and gene expression markers, with a random effect for gene expression
chip. Covariates (fixed effects) were study site, residual cell contamination (Neutrophils, Natural
Killer cells, T cell, B cell), age, and sex. When the model did not converge due to null variance
component, we fit a linear regression model with original fixed effects. The regression results from
the three groups where then combined using inverse-variance fixed effects meta-analysis. In
sensitivity analysis, we also adjusted for BMI.

Framingham Offspring Study (FOS)

FOS, initiated in 1971, is a prospective epidemiologic study of 5,124 young adults, consisting of
offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study cohort and their recruited spouses (31). The
cohort has been examined every 4-8 years for standardized medical history, blood tests and 12lead ECG (32, 33). Of FOS participants, 699 were enrolled in the Sleep Heart Health Study
(SHHS), which was initiated with a first visit (1995 – 1998) that included in-home level-2
polysomnography (Compumedics P-Series, Abbotsville, Australia), followed by a second visit
(2001 – 2003), in which a subset of 385 people underwent repeat polysomnography (34, 35). At
the FOS eighth examination cycle (2005 - 2008), RNA was extracted from whole blood for gene
expression profiling (36, 37). In this manuscript, we consider 517 individuals, all EuropeanAmericans, with both gene expression and polysomnography data. To minimize the time gap
between gene expression and polysomnography measurements and maximize statistical power, the
polysomnography measurements and corresponding phenotypes were taken from the second
SHHS visit when available, and otherwise, from the first SHHS visit.

Gene expression data collection and processing in FOS
Gene expression profiling and consecutive processing for FOS cohort have been described in detail
by Joehanes et al and Lin et al (37, 38). Briefly, collected peripheral whole blood samples from
each participant were used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was then amplified, labeled, and
reversely transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA hybridization was conducted on a Human Exon 1.0
ST array. Pre-processing steps included log2 transformation, quantile normalization, and
summarization with Robust Multi-array Average method. QC steps excluded exons with low
signal to noise ratio and transcript clusters with missing matches in RefSeq transcript records. This
resulted in 17,873 distinct transcripts available for analysis. Subsequent statistical analysis was

adjusted for multiple batch effects and technical variables and estimated white cell counts as
described in (37).

Association analysis in FOS
We fit linear mixed models to estimate the association between SDB exposure and gene expression
markers, with a random effect accounting for familial relatedness. Covariates (fixed effects) were
estimated white blood cell counts (Neutrophils, Natural Killer cells, T cell, B cell), sex, age, and
in sensitivity analysis, BMI. Because for FOS the expression measures were taken from blood 213 years after the sleep study, it is not clear how and if time varying covariates may confound the
SDB-trait gene expression association, and we adjusted for age and BMI measures at the time of
the sleep study.

SDB phenotypes and covariates
In both discovery cohorts, we studied three quantitative measures of SDB, assessed by overnight
PSG: 1) Apnea-Hypopnea indexes (AHI), defined as the number of apneas plus hypopneas per
hour of sleep that were associated with at least 3% oxygen desaturation from the preceding
baseline; 2) Average

oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep (avgO2); and 3) Minimum

oxyhemoglobin saturation (minO2) during sleep. Covariates included sex, age, and BMI (for
sensitivity analysis).

Cross-replication analysis
Each of MESA and FOS studies where treated as both a “discovery” and a “replication” study. For
each discovery cohort and each of the SDB exposures, we computed FDR-adjusted p values (FDR

q values; (39)) across the expression transcripts. Then, we took all expression transcripts with q <
0.05 for replication in the other cohort. Replication is complicated by the fact that there are
sometimes multiple transcripts per gene, and further, MESA and FOS used different platforms, so
that gene transcripts did not necessarily match between the discovery and replication studies.
Therefore, we used an approach termed “many to many” (40) in which a transcript of a specific
gene in the discovery study was matched to all transcripts of the same gene in the replication study.
After matching the list of discovery transcripts with FDR q < 0.05 in one cohort to a list of
transcripts in the second cohort, a corresponding gene was replicated if one of the transcripts in
the replication study had a one-sided p value < 0.05, requiring that the direction of association be
the same as the transcript in the discovery study (41). Replicated genes were carried forward for
further analysis in the CPAP treatment cohort.

Meta-analysis of MESA and FHS
Using the same “many-to-many” approach described above, we matched all expression transcripts
in MESA and FOS, and performed inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis for overall
exposure effect. We computed FDR-controlling qs. Genes with at least one transcript with FDRvalue < 0.05 were carried forward for further analysis in the CPAP treatment cohort.

Treatment response in a clinical cohort: the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment
(HeartBEAT) study
The Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) study is a randomized, 4-site
single-blind clinical trial that investigated the efficacy of OSA therapy in reducing cardiovascular
disease risk for patients with moderate-severe OSA (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01086800) (27). (27).

Of HeartBEAT participants randomized to the CPAP treatment group, a subsample of 15
individuals who were highly adherent to CPAP therapy (defined by at least 4 hours of CPAP use
per night over the 3-month intervention period) was selected for gene expression analysis.
Venipuncture was performed in the morning following an overnight fast. Venous blood was
collected in 8 mL heparinized Cell Prep Tubes containing Ficoll Hypaque (Becton Dickinson
#362753) in order to separate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The tubes were centrifuged
fresh at room temperature for 15 minutes at 2000 G to isolate the buffy coat, which was pelleted,
resuspended in Millipore S-002-10F freezing medium, and cryopreserved at -80C. Total RNA
was extracted using Qiagen's miRNeasy Mini kit following the manufacturer's standard protocol.
Gene expression profiling was performed using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array in
samples collected before initiating CPAP and after three months of CPAP treatment. Raw CEL
files were normalized to produce gene-level expression values using the implementation of the
Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) in the affy Bioconductor R package (version 1.36.1) and an
Entrez Gene-specific probeset mapping from the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute
(Brainarray) at the University of Michigan (version 16.0.0). Student's paired t test was performed
using the implementation in the multtest R package (version 2.14.0), and correction for multiple
hypothesis testing was accomplished using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR).
Analysis of the HeartBEAT microarray data was performed using the R environment for statistical
computing (version 2.15.1).

Testing of genes identified by MESA and FOS analyses
We used a statistical replication testing framework to study whether genes associated with SDB
traits respond to OSA treatment using CPAP. We calculated the mean fold change with gene

expression data collected post- and pre-CPAP therapy across the 15 HeartBEAT subjects. For any
given gene that was carried forward from either the cross-replication or the meta-analysis of MESA
and FOS (see Fig. 1), we computed the replication p value by applying a one-sided t-test on the
log of the estimated fold expression change. Because the replication framework, requires that
effects are consistent in their direction in the discovery and the replication stage, we defined the
direction of association between gene expression marker and OSA as positive if the mean fold
change was larger than 1 and negative otherwise. Thus, we computed one-sided p values so that a
gene could be declared as replicated in HeartBEAT only if its expression was positively associated
with more severe SDB in MESA and FOS and decreased following three months of CPAP
treatment in HeartBEAT (or vice versa). Finally, a gene was determined as responding to treatment
if its replication (one-sided) p value was < 0.05.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA, (42)) for quantitative SDB traits in each
cohort. For MESA and FOS, GSEA was applied separately for AHI, avgO2, and minO2 using
the entire gene expression profiles rank ordered based on each gene’s test statistic for the
corresponding SDB trait. For HeartBEAT, the transcriptome was rank ordered based on the
paired t statistic computed with respect to CPAP therapy. When more than one transcript was
available for a single gene (for MESA and FOS), a single transcript was selected at random. To
maximize biological relevance, we leveraged only curated pathways (Molecular Signature
Database “Canonical pathways” and “Hallmark” collections, gene symbol identifiers, version
6.0) for a total of 1379 gene sets, and performed permutation analysis (n = 1000 permutations).
We used cutoff of FDR q < 0.05 to identify significantly enriched pathways. We used

Results
Participant Characteristics
Demographic characteristics of the discovery studies FOS and MESA and the clinical
intervention study HeartBEAT are provided in Table 1. Age and BMI were similar across
cohorts. As expected, HeartBEAT study participants, who were recruited based on a minimum
AHI of 15 events/hour, were somewhat heavier and had more severe OSA than the general
population samples of FOS, and were also almost entirely male. FOS and HeartBEAT
participants were almost all of European descent, while the MESA participants included many of
African and Hispanic/Latino ancestry. Fig. 1 summarizes the analysis workflow.

Gene-based identification of transcripts associated with SDB traits
To identify differentially expressed genes associated with SDB traits, we first performed a crossreplication analysis, in which we conducted discovery analysis in each of FOS and MESA,
followed by replication analysis in the other cohort, approach aligned with the current standards
in genetic studies considered vital to interpretation of statistically significant findings. We then
meta-analyzed the information from FOS and MESA to increase power (45).

Table 2 lists eight genes that associated with the SDB traits in the cross-replication analysis. The
expression of RAB20 was positively associated with avgO2, while expression of CDYL was
negatively associated with avgO2, in both FOS and MESA. Moreover, RAB20 expression
increased following CPAP treatment in HeartBEAT (p = 0.046). The expression of TUBB6,
INVS1ABP, MAPK1, VIM, STX2, and CRIP1 was associated with either minO2 or avgO2 in both
MESA and FOS, but their expression was unchanged following CPAP treatment in HeartBEAT.

Table 3 lists 21 genes whose expressions was associated with either AHI, avgO2, or minO2 in
the meta-analysis of FOS and MESA. Of these genes, 14 (67%) were significant only in the
meta-analysis, including CD1D, whose expression was lower in association with more severe
OSA in the discovery cohorts and significantly increased with CPAP in the HeartBEAT study (p
= 0.002). Fig. 2 provides a clustered heatmap of the effect sizes (in standard deviations) of the
identified transcripts that either cross-replicated between FOS and MESA, or were detected in
the meta-analysis for each of the SDB traits.

Fig. 2. Clustered heatmap of standardized effect sizes for the OSA-associated genes in each of
the OSA traits. For each of the genes that cross-replicated in MESA and FOS, or were
discovered in their meta-analysis, the figure displays the effect sizes per 1 standard deviation of
the trait, in the study. In MESA, effect sizes are based on the meta-analysis of the estimates in
the three race/ethnic groups. Positive (blue) effect sizes of AHI and negative (orange) effect sizes
of avgO2 and minO2 represent higher expression with more severe OSA symptoms. When
multiple probes interrogated a single gene, the figure displays only one of them, selected at
random, because the results were similar across all transcripts within each gene.

Pathway-based identification of processes altered in SDB
To gain a more comprehensive assessment of gene expression patterns of SDB-associated traits,
we complemented our gene-focused association analysis by applying Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) to the entire available transcriptome in each cohort. We surveyed 1,379
canonical pathways and applied a strict FDR significance threshold (FDR q < 0.05). Data file S1
provides complete results and Table S1 provides the number of significant pathways (FDR q <
0.05) in each of the analyses. Supplementary Fig. S1 visualizes all pathways with FDR q < 0.05
in one analysis and p < 0.05 in at least one other analysis.

In the FOS study, in which gene expression was assayed several years after the sleep study, heme
metabolism was strongly and significantly up-regulated with respect to SDB severity; this was
also observed in MESA, although it did not pass multiple testing correction (AHI p = 0.02;
avgO2 p = 0.002). Other pathways had less consistent patterns across analyses. In MESA, the
strongest signal was found for avgO2: 150 gene sets were significantly up-regulated (FDR
q<0.05) with low average oxyhemoglobin saturation (i.e., with worse SDB). A visual summary
of this result is depicted in Fig. 3, where network analysis was used to link related gene sets into
larger modules comprised of functionally similar processes, in particular those related to
immunity and inflammation or development and remodeling. In the HeartBEAT cohort, we
found that pathways involved in immunity and inflammation, transcription and cell cycle, and
circadian rhythms were down-regulated following CPAP therapy, whereas gene sets related to
oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism were up-regulated (Fig. 4). Taken together, our
pathway analyses across multiple cohorts suggested that immuno-inflammatory processes are

activated in individuals with low avgO2 and, importantly, effective treatment of OSA with
CPAP moderates this pro-inflammatory signal.
Discussion
We performed a comprehensive study of the association of SDB traits with genome-wide gene
expression in peripheral blood. We combined two large population-based studies, FOS and
MESA, to study the associations of three continuous measures of SDB in the general population,
and we also compared gene expressions before and after CPAP treatment in a subset of
individuals from the HeartBEAT clinical trial who had moderate to severe OSA and were
adherent to treatment. We identified 22 genes whose expressions were associated with SDB traits
in either cross-replication or meta-analysis of FOS and MESA. Most of these differentially
expressed genes were associated with measures of hypoxemia: avgO2 and minO2. While these
measures of hypoxemia may be influenced by conditions other than SDB, two of these genes,
CD1D and RAB20, showed evidence of change with OSA treatment in the expected directions;
both were expressed at lower levels in individuals with more severe SDB in FOS and MESA,
and their expression increased significantly in HeartBEAT patients following treatment with
CPAP, suggesting that OSA was the cause of their differential expression.

The RAB20 gene encodes the Ras-related protein Rab20, a member of the Rab family of small
GTPAses. Expression of RAB20 is regulated by Hypoxia-Inducible transcription factor (HIF-1α)
(46), a protein whose expression responds to changes in tissue oxygen tension, and enhances
oxygen availability and reduces oxygen demand in a hypoxic microenvironment (47). In our
analysis, more severe SDB (higher AHI, lower minO2, and avgO2) was associated with lower
expression of RAB20. Impaired RAB20 expression in human skeletal muscle is associated with

impaired skeletal muscle glucose uptake and reduced total body insulin sensitivity (47).
Reduced insulin sensitivity is a common pathophysiological finding in SDB (48, 49) and can be
induced by as little as 8 hours of exposure to intermittent hypoxia (50, 51). Recent animal data
also indicate that RAB20 is a negative regulator of neurite outgrowth, and thus may influence
neuronal network development, potentially influencing brain development (52). The lower
RAB20 expression in association with SDB severity is somewhat surprising, as hypoxemia is
reportedly associated with HIF-1-mediated up-regulation of RAB20 expression (34,(46). There
was only a very weak evidence for association of HIF-1𝛼 expression with SDB traits in our
analysis, however, possibly reflecting the complexity of pathways that regulate HIF-1, including
both hypoxia and redox-sensitive pathways, as well as the predominantly post-transcriptional
mechanisms regulating HIF-1 signaling (53). That CPAP treatment was associated with
increased RAB20 expression in HeartBEAT subjects implies that OSA was the cause of reduced
RAB20 expression in the cross-sectional analysis, and suggests a mechanism whereby CPAP
treatment may improve glucose metabolism in OSA patients.

The CDID gene encodes the CD1D antigen, an MHC class I-like molecule expressed on both
myeloid and lymphoid cells that binds glycolipids and presents them to T cell receptors on
natural killer T cells (54, 55). It is possible that reduction in CD1D antigen, potentially
associated with the observed reduction in its expression, may contribute to impaired immune
function that has been observed in individuals with OSA (56, 57). CD1D expression was
reported to be regulated by retinoic acid (58) in mononuclear cells. In addition, the retinoic acid
pathway was significantly down-regulated in lower avgO2 in MESA, and up-regulated in
response to CPAP treatment in HeartBEAT (Data File S1), suggesting a role for retinoic acid in

mediating reduced CD1D expression in SDB. It has also been reported that natural killer (NK) T
cells have impaired maturation and cytotoxicity in untreated OSA patients, and that this
immunosuppressive phenotype was correlated with severity of hypoxemia (59). Given the
apparent importance of NK cell activity to immunosurveillance of human cancer (60), CD1Dmediated impairment in natural killer cell function may be implicated in the increased cancer risk
in individuals with OSA (61, 62) as well as the increased tumor implantation and growth in
animal models of intermittent hypoxia (63, 64).

Other genes identified by the FOS and MESA analysis that did not demonstrate a response to
CPAP treatment in HeartBEAT subjects include MAPK1, involved in the HIF-1𝛼 response to
hypoxia (65), and CTNNA1, that encodes a protein shown to respond to chronic intermittent
hypoxia in a mouse study of transcription in cardiac rhythm genetic networks (66). Two related
genes were up-regulated under lower oxygen saturation: annexin A2 (ANXA2) and S100 Calcium
Binding Protein A10 (S100A10). These genes code proteins that interact with each other (67) and
both were shown to contribute to pulmonary microvascular integrity by preventing vascular leak
during alveolar hypoxia in mice (68). Since the expression of these genes did not respond to
CPAP therapy, they may indicate persistent alterations in transcriptional response as a result of
chronic OSA.

Hypoxemia is known to influence the expression of a wide array of genes and prior studies have
demonstrated many more genes are up-regulated than down-regulated in response to
experimental sustained or intermittent hypoxemia (50). Consistent with this finding, we
observed many more pathways up-regulated than down-regulated in association with increased

severity of SDB traits such as low avgO2. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated upregulation of heme metabolic pathways across FOS and MESA cohorts with more severe SDB
symptoms. Previous experiments showed that subjecting cells to hypoxia up-regulates the
expression of several proteins involved in iron/heme metabolisms, including transferrin (69),
transferrin receptor (70), ceruloplasmin (71), and erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (72) in
order to increase erythropoiesis and hematopoietic iron supply. Our previous genetic association
analysis identified variants eQTL for ferrochelatase (FECH), the terminal enzyme in heme
biosynthesis, associated with SDB traits (73), suggesting a possible bidirectional association
between SDB and heme metabolism pathways.

A key finding of our study is that in a large, ethnically diverse subject cohort to date (MESA),
was demonstrating that SDB is associated with up-regulation of pathways involved in immune
function and inflammation (Fig. 3). Critically, we found that this immuno-inflammatory signal
was down-regulated in the HeartBEAT study patients following CPAP treatment (Fig. 4),
providing the first transcriptome-wide evidence that is consistent with a reversal of known proinflammatory markers of OSA with effective therapy (74). Another large biological module
emerging from pathway analysis of the MESA cohort was up-regulation of gene sets involved in
development and remodeling. This finding is supportive of the growing evidence based on
animal models and human data that OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia are associated with aberrant
cardiovascular remodeling (75-77). In the HeartBEAT cohort, we also observed down-regulation
of pathways involved in cancer and cell cycle following resolution of OSA and nocturnal
hypoxemia with CPAP therapy. Although many cell types, including lymphocytes, may undergo
cell cycle arrest in response to hypoxia (78, 79), our findings are consistent with recent work

supporting down-regulation of neoplastic programs after CPAP (23) and the potentially
increased risk of cancer associated with OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia (80, 81).

In this work, we utilized data from three different studies to identify genes and gene sets that
show expression levels that vary with SDB traits, then explored which expression signals change
with OSA treatment. These studies differed in designs and populations. Notably, despite
differences in the temporal associations between the sleep studies and gene expression assays (in
MESA the sleep study was performed during the year following the blood draw while in FOS,
the sleep study was performed between 13 to 2 years prior to the blood draw), and racial/ethnic
composition of the samples, we observed consistent associations for 22 genes in FOS and
MESA. The comparability of findings despite variations in the timing between the sleep
phenotyping and blood draws may reflect that relative stability of SDB traits over approximately
5 years (82). In the Supplementary Materials, we further report look-ups of previously-reported
genes associated with OSA and with CPAP treatment.

These analyses in the observational MESA and FOS studies cannot distinguish between effects
of OSA on gene expression and effects of gene expression as a cause of OSA. As the
associations observed are strongest for measures of sleep-related hypoxemia, rather than the
AHI, these analyses are also unable to distinguish effects of OSA from effects of hypoxemia that
may be due to underlying pulmonary disease. The data from HeartBEAT study showing that the
reduced gene expression of CD1D and RAB20 seen in the cohort studies was reversed by CPAP
treatment is strong evidence that OSA is the cause of the reduced expression of these genes.
However, the HeartBEAT sample was small and the lack of significant change in gene

expression for the other signals that were identified in the FOS and MESA discovery step does
not exclude an etiological role of those genes in OSA-related regulatory pathways.

SDB is strongly associated with BMI (83), and it is challenging to disentangle the effect of SDB
from that of BMI. In a sensitivity analysis (Tables S2 and S3), most of the associations become
slightly weaker after adjustment for BMI; however, BMI directly influences SDB by altering
airway collapsibility, and it is therefore not clear that adjustment for BMI results in a less rather
than a more confounded effect estimate. The response to CPAP therapy of CD1D and RAB20
indicates that the expression changes identified for these genes is due to OSA and not obesity.

In summary, we report the largest gene expression analysis of SDB traits to date. While precise
measures of SDB are challenging to obtain in large-scale cohorts, we leveraged the availability
of population-based studies that performed in-home polysomnography and combined our
transcriptional analysis of these cohorts with a clinical trial for better control of confounding and
confirmation of expression changes with treatment. Using a gene-focused discovery and
validation methodology, we identified CD1D and RAB20 as being key down-regulated genes in
SDB whose expression responded to CPAP treatment. A complementary pathway-based
approach revealed that SDB severity is associated with alteration of distinct peripheral blood
programs including up-regulation of immuno-inflammatory signals that were reversed with
effective CPAP therapy. Collectively, our study provides a framework to investigate the
transcriptional consequences of SDB traits in multi-cohort datasets and identify putative
candidate genes and processes driving this response.

Table 2. Genes identified in cross-replication analysis of MESA and FOS. Each row represents a
gene transcript that replicated between FOS and MESA. Discovery cohort is the study in which
the expression transcript was discovered (FDR q < 0.05). The identifiers corresponding to the
transcript within each gene expression platform (MESA probe, FOS probeset, HeartBEAT
Entrez Gene ID) are indicated. Discovery p is the original discovery p value, prior to multipletesting adjustment. Discovery FDR-value is the FDR q in the discovery study, after FDR
correction was applied to the discovery trait analysis. Replication p values are one-sided p values
in the follow-up cohorts, with directions based on the direction of association in the discovery
cohort. Cross-replication refers to FOS, when MESA is the discovery study, and to MESA, when
FOS is the discovery study.
