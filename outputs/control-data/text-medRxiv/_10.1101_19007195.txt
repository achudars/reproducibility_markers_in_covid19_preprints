Abstract

17

Background: Real-world data are receiving attention from regulators, biopharmaceuticals and payors as

18

a potential source of clinical evidence. However, the suitability of these data to produce evidence

19

commensurate with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the best practices in their use remain

20

unclear. We sought to compare the real-world effectiveness of Tofacitinib in the treatment of IBD

21

against efficacy rates published by corresponding RCTs.

22
23

Methods: Electronic health records at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) were queried

24

and reviewed to identify 86 Tofacitinib-treated IBD patients through 4/2019. The primary endpoint was

25

treatment effectiveness. This was measured by time-to-treatment-discontinuation and by the primary

26

endpoints of RCTs in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn’s Disease (CD). Endpoints were measured and

27

analyzed following a previously published protocol and analysis plan.

28
29

Findings: 86 patients (68 with UC, 18 with CD) initiated Tofacitinib for IBD treatment. Most of the data

30

needed to calculate baseline and follow-up disease activity indices were documented within the EHR

31

(77% for UC, 91% for CD). Baseline characteristics of the UCSF and RCT cohorts were similar, except for a

32

longer disease duration and 100% treatment failure of Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors in the former.

33

None of the UCSF cohort would have met the RCT eligibility criteria due to multiple reasons.

34
35

The rate of achieving the RCT primary endpoints were highly similar to the published rates for both UC

36

(16%, P=0·5) and CD (38%, P=0·8). However, treatment persistence was substantially higher: 69% for UC

37

(week 52) and 75% for CD (week 26).

38
39

Interpretation: An analysis of routinely collected clinical data can reproduce published Tofacitinib

40

efficacy rates, but also indicates far greater treatment durability than suggested by RCTs including

41

possible benefit in CD. These results underscore the value of real-world studies to complement RCTs.

47

Tofacitinib is the most recently approved treatment for Ulcerative Colitis. Data related to treatment

48

efficacy for either IBD subtype is generally limited, whether from controlled trials or real-world studies.

49

A search of clinicaltrials.gov was performed in January 2019 for completed phase 2 or 3, interventional,

50

placebo-controlled clinical trials matching the terms “Crohn’s Disease” OR “Ulcerative Colitis” in the

51

conditions field, and matching “Placebo” AND “Tofacitinib” OR “CP-690,550”) in the Interventions field.

52

We identified three Phase 3 trials for UC (OCTAVE trials, all initially reported in a single article in 2016)

53

and three Phase 2 trials of CD (two published in the same article in 2017, one reported in 2014). The

54

Phase 3 UC trials reported 57·6% pooled clinical response rate in the Tofacitinib-assigned groups after 8

55

weeks (induction), and a 37·5% pooled remission rate among eligible induction trial responders in the

56

Tofacitinib-assigned groups at 52 weeks. The 2017 CD trial reported a 70·8% pooled rate of response or

57

remission in the Tofacitinib-assigned groups after 8 weeks, and a 47·6% pooled rate of response or

58

remission among enrolled induction-trial responders at 26 weeks. A bias assessment of both UC and CD

59

trials indicated a high risk of attrition bias and unclear risk of bias related to conflicts of interest. We also

60

performed a search of pubmed.gov in January 2019 using search terms (“Colitis” OR “Crohn’s”) AND

61

(“Tofacitinib” OR “CP-690,550”) OR “real-world” to identify cohort studies of Tofacitinib efficacy in

62

routine clinical practice. No studies meeting these criteria were identified.

63
64

Added value of this study

65

This is one of the early studies to closely compare the results of clinical trials with the continuously-

66

updated data captured in the electronic health records, and the very the first to assess the efficacy-

67

effectiveness gap for Tofacitinib. We found that none of the patients treated at our center thus far

68

would have qualified for the clinical trial based on published eligibility criteria. We found that the drug

69

appeared to perform similarly to its efficacy when using the endpoints reported in clinical trials, but

70

treatment persistence was significantly greater than would have been expected from the reported trial

71

outcomes: 69% for UC at week 52 and 75% for CD at week 26.

72
73

Implications of all the available evidence

74

Tofacitinib is an effective treatment for the Ulcerative colitis and may be efficacious for Crohn’s disease.

75

Controlled trials may not be representative of real-world cohorts, may not be optimally designed to

76

identify efficacious drugs, and may not accurately predict patterns of use in clinical practice. Further

77

studies using real-world data as well as methods to enable their proper use are needed to confirm and

78

continuously monitor the efficacy and safety of drugs, both for on- and off-label use.

benefits, and alternatives. As such, RCT endpoints which are commonly binary, uniformly applied, and

Patient identification and covariate extraction

124
125

We queried a structured database of deidentified Electronic Health Records (EHR) at the University of

126

California, San Francisco (UCSF) to identify patients meeting the following criteria: 1) age 18 or older, 2)

127

presence of a medication order for Tofacitinib, and 3) presence of an IBD diagnosis code (ICD-10-CM

128

K50*/K51*) assigned during a Gastroenterology clinic visit (Table 1). The scope of the search extended

129

from the instantiation of the EHR software (6/2012) through the time of the query (4/2019). We

130

obtained Institutional Review Board approval (#18-24588) to obtain identifiable patient record data, to

131

confirm that these patients had initiated treatment on Tofacitinib for the treatment of IBD, and to

132

assess treatment compliance. Compliance was defined as adherence to the treatment plan (e.g. dose,

frequency, duration) determined by the ordering provider.

Cohort Identification

187
188

We queried an EHR structured database system comprising ~1·2 million patient records to identify adult

189

patients with an IBD diagnosis assigned by a gastroenterologist and a medication order for Tofacitinib.

190

115 potential patient records were identified. We performed manual review to confirm that 86 patients

191

– 68 with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and 18 with Crohn’s Disease (CD) – had initiated Tofacitinib specifically

192

to treat IBD (Figure 1). The other 29 patients were excluded during this process for multiple reasons,

193

including failure to start treatment due to payor denial, the decision to forgo the ordered medical

194

treatment in favor of surgery, and treatment initiated by a non-gastroenterologist for another

195

autoimmune condition. Non-compliance with Tofacitinib was rare (4%) in this cohort.

196
197

Data completeness assessment

198
199

We first sampled a subset of these 86 records to quantify the completeness of routinely collected

200

clinical data in the capture of IBD-relevant clinical indices. We identified 87% and 91% of all the UC and

201

CD data elements (demographics, indices) as available within the EHR. Within the set of data elements

202

needed to calculate the baseline and follow-up Mayo Score and CDAI (for UC and CD respectively), we

203

observed 77% and 91% data completeness. We performed multiple imputation on these missing

204

elements to enable further downstream analysis. For instance, patients deemed treatment failures on

205

the basis of endoscopic worsening, physician global assessment, and stool frequency but missing a rectal

206

bleeding subscore required imputation in order to calculate the full Mayo score.

207
208

Baseline cohort comparison

209
210

The baseline demographics of the subjects under study in the RCTs and the UCSF cohort were largely

211

similar (Table 1). Notable differences include the universal failure of TNF inhibitors in the UCSF cohort,

212

as well as a longer duration of disease in the UC patients. Patient groups had similar baseline Mayo

213

scores, c-reactive protein levels, and rates of corticosteroid use.

215

We assessed the proportion of UC patients who would have satisfied the eligibility criteria of the

216

corresponding Phase III RCT . We found that 0% of the UC patients initiated on Tofacitinib met these

217

criteria. The reasons for this were multifactorial (Table 2) but include prior use of Vedolizumab within

218

the previous year, use of high-dose prednisone or intravenous methylprednisolone at the time of

219

treatment initiation, possibility of requiring surgery during the treatment period, and the lack of

220

protocolized screening or scheduled steroid tapering in the routine clinical setting.

2

221
222

We separately explored what proportion of patients met the specific RCT entry criteria defined by the

223

Mayo score and CDAI for UC and CD respectively. 93% (73-98) of the UC patients had an eligible baseline

224

Mayo score, whereas 50% (19-82) of the CD patients had a baseline CDAI within the eligible range of the

225

corresponding RCT.

226
227

Efficacy vs Effectiveness

228
229

Time to treatment discontinuation analysis on the full cohort revealed nearly identical survival

230

distributions irrespective of IBD disease subtype (Figure 2). The overall probability of incident users

231

maintaining long-term treatment on Tofacitinib was 68% (58-80%). All failure events occurred within the

232

first seven months; among continued responders by month six, the probability of sustained long-term

233

response was 94%. Of note, the first use of the Tofacitinib occurred in 2013, and the longest duration of

234

effectiveness data relevant to treatment maintenance was 3·7 years.

235

2

236

22% of all subjects participating in the induction phase of the UC RCT

met the primary maintenance

237

endpoint of week 52 clinical remission. We observed a similar rate (16%) in the corresponding UCSF

238

cohort (6-37%, p-value 0·5). Similarly, the rate of achieving the primary endpoint in the CD RCT

239

was essentially the same as the point estimate of the real-world cohort (38%, p-value 0·8).

3

(34%)

240
241

However, the rates of meeting these regulatory endpoints were substantially different from the week 52

242

and week 26 survival probabilities for UC and CD respectively (p-values 3e-14 and 9e-5). This difference

243

from the empiric response rate remained even when compared to the least stringent secondary

244

endpoint for the UC RCT (week 52 clinical response), met by 33% of all induction participants (p-value

245

0·05).

279
280

The results of our study have important implications for both the future of real-world evidence studies

281

and specifically the treatment of IBD. We show that routinely collected clinical data from the EHR is

282

sufficiently rich to enable the measurement of the primary clinical instruments used in IBD RCTs with

283

limited missingness. We also demonstrate that point-estimates of clinical effectiveness derived from

284

RWD align well with those suggested by RCTs when using the same clinical instruments. These results

285

support the potential for robust inference from RWD.

286
287

However, our data also speak to the presence of a significant efficacy-effectiveness gap between

288

treatment durability in practice and regulatory endpoints measured in clinical trials. More than the

289

regulatory endpoint, these pragmatic endpoints may provide the best answer to patients who ask: “How

290

likely is this drug to work for me?” (Answer: “Over half of patients like you will respond to treatment

291

long-term. It can take six months on treatment to know if you fall in this category”). Similarly, this

292

pragmatic endpoint may be most relevant to payors increasingly keen on paying for value and

293

anticipating the long-term costs of care.

294
295

Additionally, our study speaks to a number of implications on current trial design in IBD and their

296

application to practice. We found that only half of the CD patients at our center mounted a CDAI score

reasons for this were related to the careful control of alternative explanations to any differences in trial

between internal and external validity, and specifically the importance of integrating controlled- and

negative trial results in CD, we expected to see a divergence of survival distributions and a clear signal

309

that the drug does not work in CD. This finding to the contrary suggests two important corollaries: 1) the

310

CDAI may not be the optimal instrument to measure Crohn’s Disease activity, and 2) that the current

311

taxonomy of IBD (UC vs CD) may not be well rooted in molecular pathogenesis. Indeed, nearly all

312

pharmacological treatments between CD and UC are shared. Our results are consistent with recent post-

313

hoc analyses of the CD clinical trials suggesting a signal for efficacy if analyzed using more objective

314

endpoints,

315

the potential of real-world studies to harness “the wisdom of the masses,” to identify robust efficacy

316

signals that may support label expansion, and to expand options for the truly refractory patient facing

317

limited alternatives.

21

as well as the continued investigation of other JAK inhibitors for CD. These data underscore

318
319

We acknowledge several limitations to this study. First, our sample size is still small. This is due to the

320

relatively recent approval of the drug for UC and its lack of EMA or FDA approval for CD. Although small

321

samples decrease the power to detect differences, the signals seen here were strong enough to reveal

322

many important effects, including survival distributions that are highly consistent with prior reports.

323

course, patient cohorts will continue to expand as this drug continues to be used, and real-world data

324

can keep growing.

Second, although we attempted to comprehensively characterize possible biases and place our findings

327

in context (Table 3), we cannot exclude the possibility of residual bias. Third, the validity of imputation

328

depends on the missing at random (MAR) assumption. We would argue that this assumption is plausible:

329

the most common reasons for missingness were clear indications of treatment failure (e.g. no rationale

330

to pursue endoscopy), there was complete measurement of the survival outcome, and the list of

331

auxiliary variables was extensive. Nevertheless, it remains fundamentally untestable. Lastly, our chart

332

review process – albeit guided by a detailed pre-published protocol – may not be entirely objective nor

333

scalable.

334
335

In summary, our study suggests that RWD can be a robust source of valuable clinical knowledge that

336

complements evidence from controlled trials. Tofacitinib appears to work as well as has been suggested

337

by clinical trials when using the same clinical instruments, but has greater real-world durability. Despite

338

negative trial results, Tofacitinib and JAK inhibitors more generally may be valuable for the treatment of

339

CD. Lastly, because clinical trials functionally exclude many patients, real-world studies are indispensable

340

to ensure the generalizability of RCT findings and add to the best evidence for clinical care.

Description

Effect on efficacy/effectiveness

Potential Solutions

Many real-world patients initiated Tofacitinib following
hospitalization, surgical consultation and intravenous
steroids (all RCT exclusion criteria).

Possible decreased real-world
effectiveness

Model-based approaches (e.g. propensity-score matching,
inverse probability of treatment weighting)

Confounding Bias (e.g. Bias by
Indication)
•

Influences on decision to
treat based on likelihood of
response

Selection Bias
•

Restrictive RCT eligibility
criteria (See Table 2)

Multiple exclusion criteria may limit generalizability to
ordinary populations

Unclear effect on treatment
efficacy measured by RCTs

Further studies of real-world cohorts

•

Tertiary care referral center
population, off-label use in
refractory patients

Greater prevalence of treatment-resistant patients

Possible decreased real-world
effectiveness

Further studies of real-world cohorts

Measurement Bias
•

‘Laxity’ in real-world use
patterns compared to
protocol-driven endpoints

Lack of steroid-de-escalation protocols and refractory
patients with limited alternatives may tolerate a suboptimal
treatment response for a longer period of time.

Increased real-world
effectiveness measured by time
to treatment discontinuation

Trend real-world response rates over time

•

Intention to treat analysis
with non-responder
imputation

Subjects non-adherent to the active arm and/or follow-up
protocols are analyzed as treatment non-responders

Decreased treatment effect
measured by RCTs

Re-analysis of clinical trial data with use of alternative
imputation methods

•

Use of 6 month windows
for covariate capture

Baseline and follow-up covariates were captured by protocol
to accommodate real-world practice

Unclear effect on real-world
effectiveness

Model-based approaches to more accurately estimate
values at fixed time points

•

Unblinded chart review

Chart reviewer not blinded to outcome

Unclear effects on real-world
effectiveness

Use of multiple blinded reviewers (assessing unrelated
components) with measurement of interrater reliability
