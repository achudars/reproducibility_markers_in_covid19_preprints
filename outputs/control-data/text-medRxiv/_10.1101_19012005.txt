ABSTRACT
A subset of gliomas has DNA repair defects that lead to hypermutated genomes. While such
tumors are resistant to alkylating chemotherapies, they may also express more mutant
neoantigens on their cell surfaces, and thus be more responsive to immunotherapies. A fast,
inexpensive method of screening for hypermutated gliomas would therefore be of great clinical
value. Since immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Msh2,
Msh6, Mlh1, and Pms2 is already used to screen for hypermutated colorectal cancers, we
sought to determine whether that panel might have similar utility in gliomas. MMR IHC was
scored in 100 WHO grade I-IV gliomas with known tumor mutation burdens (TMB), while
blinded to TMB data. Eight of 100 cases showed loss of one or more MMR proteins by IHC, and
all 8 were hypermutated. Among the remaining 94 gliomas with intact MMR IHC, only one was
hypermutated; that tumor had an inactivating mutation in another DNA repair gene, ATM.
Overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 99%, 89%, and 100%, respectively. The
strongest correlates with hypermutation were prior TMZ treatment, MGMT promoter methylation,
and IDH1 mutation. Among MMR-deficient hypermutated gliomas, 50% contained both MMRlost and MMR-retained tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that MMR IHC could be a
viable front-line screening test for gliomas in which immunotherapy is being considered. They
also suggest that not all cells in a hypermutated glioma may actually be MMR-deficient, a
finding that might need to be considered when treating such tumors with immunotherapies.

INTRODUCTION
Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults [19]. Standard of care
includes surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA
alkylating agent [24]. However, tumors nearly always recur and lose sensitivity to adjuvant
therapy.
When GBMs are challenged with TMZ, recurrent subclones often emerge with
inactivating mutations in genes encoding DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzymes, most
commonly MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 [7, 11, 28]. Glioma tumor mutation burden (TMB) is
normally ~1 mutation per megabase (Mb) of DNA [2], but MMR defects can lead to a
“hypermutator” phenotype, defined as TMB >20 mutations/Mb DNA [10, 11, 14]. Hypermutated
tumor cells tend to display more mutant proteins on their surfaces, making them potentially
more vulnerable to immunotherapies like PD-1 and PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors [4, 9]. Other
forms of hypermutated cancers have shown promising responses to immune checkpoint
inhibitors [20], and there is great interest in this strategy for hypermutated gliomas [6, 10].
Next generation sequencing (NGS) is the current gold standard for detecting DNA MMR
defects and quantifying TMB, but larger panels are costly and have prolonged turnaround time.
Targeted NGS panels, such as Glioseq [18], are less expensive and faster, but usually do not
screen for MMR mutations and do not cover enough of the genome to reliably determine TMB.
A standardized quartet of IHC stains (Msh6, Msh2, Mlh1, and Pms2) is used to detect
loss of normal MMR gene expression in colorectal cancers [22]. Because most pathology
laboratories already have this MMR IHC panel for routine use, we sought to determine its utility
as a screening test for hypermutated gliomas.

METHODS
The cohort consisted of 100 World Health Organization (WHO) grade I-IV gliomas from
the Northwestern Nervous System Tumor Bank with known TMB and MMR gene mutations, as
determined by Tempus xT NGS covering approximately 600 genes (Table 1). Case collection
was done under a Northwestern Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. IHC was
performed using 4 different primary antibodies, including Msh2 (Cell Marque G219-1129,
1:700), Msh6 (Cell Marque 44 (287M-15), 1:100), Mlh1 (Leica NCL-L-MLH1, 1:100), and Pms2
(Cell Marque MRQ-28 (288M-15), 1:50). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 4 µm thick tissue
sections were baked at 60°C for 30-60 minutes before being deparaffinized and re-hydrated.
Antigen retrieval for Msh6, Msh2, and Pms2 was achieved using a Universal Retrieval (Abcam)
buffer in a decloaking chamber reaching 110°C for 5-20 minutes. Antigen retrieval for Mlh1 used
a citrate buffer (pH 6) in a decloaking chamber reaching 110°C for 10 minutes. Slides were
cooled to room temperature and washed in TBS before neutralizing endogenous peroxidase
(Biocare Peroxidase 1). Slides were then treated with a serum-free casein background block
(Biocare Background Sniper) before pre-incubation in a 10% goat serum block for 60 minutes.
Primary antibody was added to the slides for overnight incubation at 4°C. After incubation,
slides were washed in 3 5-minute washes with TBS-T before incubating in HRP polymer
(Biocare MACH 4 Universal HRP Polymer). Reaction products were visualized with DAB
(Biocare Betazoid DAB Chromogen Kit). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated, and mounted with xylene-based mounting media.
Each IHC marker was examined under light microscopy by two independent reviewers
(MM and CH) while blinded to NGS data and TMB. Each IHC marker was scored as “retained”
or “lost.” In cases with lost MMR expression, the pattern (homogeneous versus heterogeneous)
was noted. Nonneoplastic cells within each glioma (e.g. lymphocytes, endothelial cells) served
as internal positive controls. Interobserver discrepancies were resolved by reviewing equivocal
cases together. Regression analyses were performed using http://vassarstats.net/multU.html

RESULTS
The cohort of 100 gliomas with NGS and TMB data included 70 grade IV GBMs, 13
grade III astrocytomas, 4 grade II astrocytomas, 2 grade III oligodendrogliomas, 7 grade II
oligodendrogliomas, and 4 grade I gliomas (Table 1). Eight (8%) showed loss of at least one
MMR protein by IHC (Figure 1, Table 2). All 8 gliomas with MMR loss had TMB >20, and all 8
had mutations and/or copy number losses in corresponding MMR genes (Table 2). Of the
remaining 92 gliomas with intact MMR IHC, only one was hypermutated (TMB=29.5). That
glioma did not have mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, or PMS2, but instead contained an
inactivating splice site mutation in ATM (Table 2). Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of
MMR IHC for identifying hypermutated gliomas in this cohort was 88%, 100%, and 99%,
respectively.
All 9 hypermutated gliomas had MGMT promoter methylation and were post-TMZ
recurrences, and 5/9 (56%) were IDH1 mutant (Table 2). Correlation and multiple regression
analyses confirmed that the variables most strongly associated with hypermutation were prior
treatment with TMZ, MGMT methylation, and IDH1 mutation (Table 3 and Table 4).
In 4 of 8 gliomas with lost MMR expression, the pattern of loss was clearly
heterogeneous, as some tumor cells retained all MMR enzymes, while other cells lost
expression of one or more MMR enzymes (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
Despite their generally aggressive behavior, gliomas tend to have low TMB relative to
most other kinds of cancer [2]. However, gliomas that are hypermutated, either at initial
presentation or recurrence, may be ideal targets for immunotherapy. Such gliomas usually show
increased numbers of infiltrating CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [17, 27], which is consistent with the
postulate that hypermutated gliomas are more immunogenic.
Hypermutated gliomas have been a subject of intense investigation for some time,
though the reported frequencies of hypermutation vary markedly due to differences in cohort
selection. In our screening of over 660 untreated sporadic grade II-IV TCGA gliomas in GlioVis
[5], only 15 had detectable mutations in DNA repair enzymes (not shown). But a study by the
TCGA consortium showed that 7/19 (36%) TMZ-treated GBMs were hypermutated [1]. Johnson
et al. reported hypermutation patterns in 6/10 (60%) post-TMZ tumors, and suggested that most
of the acquired mutations were likely directly induced by TMZ [14]. In a separate study of 114
matched pre- and post-treatment GBMs, 17 (15%) showed a hypermutator profile at recurrence;
among those 17 cases, 16 had mutations in MMR genes, and showed enrichment for MGMT
methylation and IDH1 mutation [26]. Others have verified the association between IDH1
mutations and hypermutation after TMZ [14, 25, 30]. Among 157 pediatric gliomas, only 9 (6%)
were hypermutated, and 7 contained mutations in DNA repair genes [13]. In our own cohort,
9/100 gliomas were hypermutated, all 9 had been previously treated with TMZ, all 9 had MGMT
promoter methylation, and 5/9 were IDH1 mutant (Table 2). Screening for hypermutationassociated MMR defects therefore appears to be of greatest value in recurrent, post-TMZ
gliomas, especially MGMT-methylated and/or IDH1 mutant tumors (Table 3 and Table 4).
Although the Msh2, Msh6, Mlh1, and Pms2 IHC panel is used to screen colorectal
cancer, mutations in other DNA repair genes have also been reported in post-TMZ
hypermutated gliomas, including MSH4, MSH5, MLH3, PMS1, POLE, and POLD1 [5, 10, 13,
26]. In our own cohort, we found a hypermutated glioma with an inactivating mutation in yet

another gene associated with DNA repair, ATM (Table 2) [3]. Thus, while the MMR IHC panel
designed for colorectal cancer detects most hypermutated gliomas, it may be helpful to add
more IHC markers for gliomas.
Interpretation of MMR IHC in gliomas is relatively straightforward, especially since
nonneoplastic cells within the glioma serve as a reliable positive control (Figure 1). MMR
staining is lost in areas of necrosis and thermal artifact (not shown), so such regions should not
be scored.
Thus far, results from immune checkpoint inhibitors in gliomas have been mixed [6, 15,
21, 29]. While at least partial responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors have been observed in
patients whose sporadic gliomas had elevated TMB [8, 16], the best responses have mostly
been in glioma patients with an inherited defect in an MMR gene, where 100% of the glioma
cells have MMR deficiency [4, 12, 23]. Our data showing frequent heterogeneity of MMR loss in
hypermutated gliomas (Figure 2 and Table 2) underscores the fact that TMB is just a
mathematical average of the specimen that was submitted for NGS, and that subclones may
exist in “hypermutated” gliomas that are not necessarily hypermutated. Conversely,
hypermutated subclones could potentially exist in tumors whose overall TMB has not yet
reached the widely accepted cutoff of 20 mutations/Mb, although we did not see this in our own
cohort (not shown).
In sum, DNA MMR enzyme IHC can serve as a rapid, low-cost method of screening for
hypermutated gliomas. Highest yield for screening includes recurrent gliomas with MGMT
promoter methylation and/or IDH1 mutations. While the current panel used for colorectal
cancers has very good sensitivity and excellent specificity, adding more DNA repair markers
would further enhance its value. Finally, it may be valuable to consider heterogeneity in
hypermutated gliomas as a possible predictor of immunotherapy response.

Figure 2: Heterogeneous MMR IHC in hypermutated gliomas. In Case 5, which was a postTMZ IDH1 mutant GBM in a 44 year-old woman (Table 2), clusters of tumor cells retained Msh2
and Msh6 positivity, but were surrounded by Msh2/6-deficient cells (a, b). Case 7 was a postTMZ IDH1 wild-type GBM in a 65 year-old woman (Table 2). Msh6 was lost in many glioma
cells (c), but under high power, it was apparent that a subset of cells with identical tumor nuclear
morphology retained Msh6 (d, red asterisk). Also note the smaller rounded nuclei in (d), which
are most likely lymphocytes and/or oligodendrocytes. Scale bar=100 µm in (a, b, c) and 25 µm
in (d).
