ABSTACT
Alcohol intake and the risk of various types of cancers have been previously correlated.
Correlation though does not always mean that a causal relationship between the two is
present. Excessive alcohol consumption is also correlated with other lifestyle factors and
behaviours, such as smoking and increased adiposity, that also affect the risk of cancer and
make the identification and estimation of the causal effect of alcohol on cancer difficult.
Here, using individual level data for 322,193 individuals from the UK Biobank, we report the
observational and causal effects of alcohol consumption on types of cancer previously
suggested as correlated to alcohol. Alcohol was observationally associated with cancers of
the lower digestive system, head and neck and breast cancer. No associations were
observed when we considered those keeping alcohol consumption below the recommended
threshold of 14 units/week. When Mendelian randomisation was used to assess the causal
effect of alcohol on cancer, we found that increasing alcohol consumption, especially above
the recommended level, was causal to head and neck cancers but not breast cancer. Our
results where replicated using a two sample MR method and data from the much larger
COGS genome wide analysis of breast cancer. We conclude that alcohol is causally related to
head and neck cancers, especially cancer of larynx, but the observed association with breast
cancer are likely due to confounding. The suggested threshold of 14 units/week appears
suitable to manage the risk of cancer due to alcohol.

INTRODUCTION
Harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption have been suggested for various diseases,
including liver cirrhosis, cancer and cardiovascular disease, as well as risk of injuries through
accidents 123. In the case of the association of alcohol with cancer, both ethanol and the
products of its metabolism from the cells are considered to be carcinogenic 4. A large body
of work exists on the association between alcohol consumption and different types of
cancer in model organisms and population samples 5–7. Recently, a meta-analysis of the
cancer and alcohol observational literature produced a list of seven cancers, including
cancers of the: oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and female breast, that
are associated with heavy alcohol consumption 8. These results have been widely publicized
and currently form part of the official advice provided by the UK Chief Medical Officers’ Low
Risk Drinking Guidelines. According to this consumption of alcohol should not exceed 14
units per week for both men and women 9.
There are multiple limitations of relying on observational associations to establish the causal
role of alcohol on cancer and estimate its true effect on risk, especially when we are
interested in either high or low levels of consumption. Alcohol consumption is associated
with other cancer risk factors such as poorer diet high in fats and processed meat, obesity,
and most importantly, smoking 10,11. Furthermore, measurement of alcohol consumption, in
the vast majority of cases, relies on self-reported drinking habits. This requires the
participants to recall how much they drink per day, week, or month period. Studies looking
at the accuracy of self-reported alcohol consumption have found that under-reporting is
common 12 and the inaccuracy of the provided information increases with increasing levels
of consumption 13. Also, the longer the period required to recall, the less accurate the
information provided is, with periods longer than a week considered unreliable 14. Although
these limitations can be addressed through the use of randomised control trials, this is not
an option in this case due to logistical and ethical problems. In such cases we can make use
of the existing genetic variability as a natural randomised control study 15. Instead of
randomly assigning individuals in cases and controls groups, we rely on genetic variation
that affects alcohol consumption to identify those that are likely to consume more alcohol
and those that are likely to consume less. As long as the chosen genetic variant is not
associated with any of the possible confounders of the association between alcohol and
cancer, we can use this variant as an unconfounded proxy of alcohol consumption to test

and estimate the effect of the associated level of alcohol consumption on risk of cancer. This
methodology is described as Mendelian Randomisation (MR) and has been previously used
to estimate the causal effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption on cardiovascular risk
using a genetic variant from the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B gene (ADH1B) 3. The ADH1B
gene codes for the ADH1B enzyme metabolising alcohol into acetaldehyde. A single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found in the ADH1B gene, located at rs1229984, changes
arginine to histidine in the encoded protein which results in increased levels of
acetaldehyde after alcohol consumption and elicits a negative reaction to alcohol16.
Here using individual level data for 322,193 people from the UK Biobank study, we aimed to
establish and estimate the causal effect of alcohol consumption on the risk of cancer types
previously suggested as associated with alcohol consumption.

METHODS
Study population
The UK Biobank is a large population study including information and biological samples for
approximately 500,000 individuals. These were recruited between 2006 and 2011. The 22
UK Biobank assessment centres throughout England, Wales and Scotland, collected baseline
data from the participants in the form of questionnaires, physical and cognitive tests and
blood and urine samples 17. The age range of the participants at the time of enrolment in
the study was from 40 to 69 years, with a mean age of 56.5 years. Males represent 45.6% of
the sample.
Alcohol intake
Alcohol intake for each participant was measured through multiple questionnaires.
Excessive drinking and drinking behaviour related problems were assessed through the
mental health questionnaire. Consumption of alcoholic drinks in the past 24 hours was
assessed through the diet questionnaire. We used average weekly intake data from the
lifestyle and environment questionnaire, including information for both weekly and monthly
consumption. These were split per alcoholic beverage. An example for the average weekly
red wine intake question was: "In an average WEEK, how many glasses of RED wine would
you drink? (There are six glasses in an average bottle)" 18. The mean answer to this question
from 348,369 participants was 3.9 glasses per week. The total number of units consumed
per week by each participants was calculated using information available from the NHS (see
19

and https://www.lanarkshirelinks.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HWL-ALCOHOL-

KNOW-YOUR-LIMITS-SHEET.pdf). Participants who had indicated that they had reduced
their alcohol consumption either due to their doctor’s advice or due to illness (UKB Field
2664) were excluded.
Cancer information
Cancer diagnoses information for the UK Biobank participants was obtained through selfreported questionnaires and through linkage to existing cancer registries, the Medical
Research Information Service for England and Wales and the Information Service Division
for Scotland. The cancer registries include information from the early 1970’s acquired
through a variety of sources, including hospitals and cancer treatment centres. More
information can be found at

http://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/docs/CancerLinkage.pdf. The data are coded using
the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). All participants who
had been diagnosed with a given cancer at any point were considered cases and those that
had not been diagnosed with that cancer were considered controls. For this study, cancer
outcomes for lip, oral cavity and pharynx (ICD 10: C00-C14), digestive organs (ICD10: C1526), larynx (ICD 10: C32) and for female only cases of breast cancer (ICD 10: C50) were used.
We also made larger categories of these by grouping C00-C14 with C32 as head and neck
cancers, C15-C26 as gastro-intestinal cancers, C15-C16 and C22-C25 as upper digestive
cancers, C17-C21 as lower digestive cancers, and all codes used in a category of any cancer.
In terms of individual cancer types, we analysed only those that had at least 100 cases
recorded in the study. In addition, acute myocardial infarction (MI) (ICD 10: I21) was used as
a positive control with a known causal association from previous analysis.
Genotyping
The rs1229984 variant was genotyped in 488,363 individuals as part of the two similar
genome wide genotyping Affymetrix Axiom arrays used in the UK Biobank. Sample quality
control metrics were provided by UK Biobank and were generated as described previously
20.

Samples were excluded from the analysis if they were determined to be outliers for

missingness or heterozygosity, and if they had any sex chromosome aneuploidies or
differences between reported and genetically inferred sex. Samples which did not have a
White British ancestry were also excluded from this analysis. A list of related individuals was
provided by UK Biobank and one individual from each related pair was excluded at random.
After filtering, a total of 333,774 participants remained in the sample genotyped for
rs1229984.
Statistical analysis
We used R 3.5.1 for analysing and plotting the results21, unless otherwise stated. For the
observational part of the study, we regressed the amount of alcohol consumed per week
against each of the outcomes considered using a robust logistic regression from the
“robust” R package 22 adjusting for age and sex. The analysis was replicated per category of
alcohol consumption grouped as below the recommended threshold (1-14 units or alcohol
per week), or above the recommended threshold (<14 units or alcohol per week). We tested
the association of the rs1229984 on alcohol consumption using a robust linear regression
model including an additive and a dominance deviation component. Due to evidence of

dominance, we repeated the analysis using a dominant minor allele coding for rs1229984 in
all participants and in groups of alcohol consumption adjusting for age, sex, the first 4
principal components (PCs) for the genetic variability of the genome, and the genotyping
array used. We tested the association of the genotype with each of the outcomes through a
logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, the 4 PCs, and genotyping array used. The analysis
was replicated per category of alcohol consumption including for those reporting 0 units of
alcohol consumed per week. To assess the causal role of alcohol consumption on cancer
risk, we used the ivprobit command in Stata 15 23 with the robust option and the maximum
likelihood estimator method, while adjusting for age, sex, PCs, and genotyping array used.
The analysis was replicated for all other categories of alcohol consumption. To confirm our
results we also used an external genome wide association (GWAS) of alcohol consumption
that identified multiple genetic polymorphisms 24 that were used in a two sample MR
through MR Base 25 with UK Biobank cancer data. For breast cancer, we also used an
external outcome file from the publicly available COGS results 26. We accepted associations
with a p-value < 0.05/15 = 0.003571 to adjust for the 15 different outcome measures tested.
We also describe results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) away from 0 or 1 accordingly
but as probable associations.

RESULTS
After filtering for poor genotyping and non-white British ethnic background and excluding
those reporting changes in their drinking behaviour due to their doctor’s advice or due to
illness, 322,193 individuals remained in the sample. The mean age of the sample was 56.8
years (Standard Deviation (SD) 8 years), with participants on average slightly overweight
with a BMI of 27.4 kg/m2 (SD 4.7 kg/m2). The sample included 54% females, and 60%
reported current or previous smoking. The average units consumed were 13 units/week
(interquartile range 19 units/week). More than a quarter of the sample (28%) reported no
alcohol intake per week, 38% were consuming alcohol below the recommended threshold
of intake (1-14 units/week), and 34% above this (>14 units/week). The frequency of the
minor T allele of the ADH1B rs1229984 SNP was 2.2%. There was no evidence of association
between the variant and any of the common risk factors for cancer (ever smoked p-value =
0.197). Those carrying the minor rs1229984 allele were less likely to exceed the
recommended level (p-value = 7.92×10-132) and more likely to report no average weekly
alcohol consumption (p-value = 4.44×10-104). A summary of the overall sample separated per
genotype is provided in Table 1.
Observational associations between alcohol and cancer revealed that increasing alcohol
consumption was associated with an increasing risk of cancer, including those of the lower,
but not upper, digestive system and head and neck cancers. In terms of specific locations,
alcohol was associated with neoplasms of the tonsils, larynx, colon and rectum, as well as
breast cancer. Alcohol appeared protective for acute MI, used as a control outcome with a
known association. Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p-values can be seen in Table
2. When the association between alcohol and cancer was tested in those drinking but within
recommended intake limits, no evidence of association between level of alcohol
consumption and cancer or acute MI was observed. In those exceeding the recommended
level of alcohol, increasing intake was associated with cancers of the tongue, tonsils, larynx,
oesophagus, colon, rectum, liver, and pancreas, as well as all broader categories tested (S
Table 1). A probable association was present for stomach cancer but did not satisfy our
multiple testing adjusted p-value threshold (S Table 1). No evidence of alcohol association
with either acute MI or breast cancer were observed per category. No outcome had
opposite direction of association per alcohol category. These results are graphically
summarised in SFigure1.

The rs1229984 ADH1B variant showed evidence of dominance of the minor allele (p =
0.0236). Using a dominant model, the variant was strongly associated with alcohol intake (Fstatistic 692.2, p-value 5.62×10-106) in the sample. Carriers of the minor T allele were
consuming on average 2.1 units/week less that the homozygotes of the common allele. The
association of the genetic variant with alcohol was also evident for both of those drinking
below (F-statistic = 47.4, p-value = 2.63×10-13) and above (F-statistic = 69.9, p-value =
1.20×10-6) the maximum recommended 14 units/week, with a difference of 0.35 and 0.87
units/week less respectively. A genetic variant, or allele score, with an F-statistic > 10 for its
association with the exposure is considered a strong instrument for use in MR. Testing the
association between the variant and the cancer outcomes though, showed no evidence of
association between the rs1229984 ADH1B variant and any of the cancer outcomes tested
in the full sample, those reporting alcohol consumption of 1 to 14 units/week, or those
drinking more than 14 units/week (STable 2). For those reporting no alcohol consumption
per week, a probable association suggesting an increase of risk of rectal cancer with the
minor allele was observed, but this is well within our expected false positives range (STable
2). In those exceeding the recommended limit of alcohol consumption, we identified a
protective effect of the minor allele of the genetic variant reducing alcohol use and acute MI
(Odds ratio 0.61, CIs 0.44-0.85, p-value = 2.95×10-3) (STable 2).
The instrumental variable regression estimating the causal effect of alcohol consumption on
the risk of cancer in all individuals showed no evidence of a causal effect at our multiple
testing adjusted p-value threshold, though a probable association was seen with the risk of
larynx cancer (probit coefficient 0.044; CIs 0.004-0.085) (Table 2). No evidence of a causal
association between alcohol consumption and cancer risk for those reporting that they
drink but on average less than 14 units/week was observed. Those exceeding the suggested
limit however showed evidence of causal association between alcohol and head and neck
cancer (0.053; CIs 0.033-0.073). Probable associations were also seen with an increase of
the risk of larynx cancer (0.049; CIs 0.001-0.097), and a decrease of the risk of tongue cancer
(-0.47; CIs -0.082 - -0.012) with alcohol, though their respective p-values do not reach our
multiple testing adjusted threshold (STable 3). For risk of MI we identified evidence of
association with alcohol consumption in those drinking more than the recommended
maximum (0.048 CIs 0.033-0.062) but not for those drinking below it or in the sample
overall (STable 3). The results are visually summarised in Figure 1.

The two sample MR using the recently published polygenic associations with alcohol
consumption 24 did not fundamentally change our results (Table 2). The biggest difference
was the probable causal association of any cancer category with alcohol consumption (OR
1.45, CIs 1.12-1.89), though MR Egger results did not support this effect. Alcohol had a
probable causal association to head and neck cancer for both the inverse variance weighted
(OR 3.86, CIs 1.33-11.21) and MR Egger method. Similarly, cancer of the larynx had again
evidence of a probable causal association not reaching our multiple testing adjusted p-value
(OR 15.22, CIs 1.65-140.12). Cancer of the oesophagus also showed probable evidence of a
causal association (ORs 4.18, CIs 1.02-17.18). Alcohol consumption was not associated with
the risk of breast cancer in either of the analyses we performed using events in UK Biobank
or when we used outcome associations from the largest breast cancer GWAS available from
COGS 26 (OR 0.96, CIs 0.77-1.18) (Table 2 & SFigure 2).

DISCUSSION
We set out to identify and estimate the causal effect of self-reported weekly alcohol
consumption on the risk of cancer in the parts of the body in direct contact with alcohol
during digestion. We also included breast cancer as a common cancer correlated to alcohol
consumption and acute MI as a control outcome for which the causal effect of alcohol was
previously well established 3,27. We found observational associations between weekly
alcohol consumption and cancers of the digestive system. The genetic variant chosen as an
instrument for alcohol consumption was strongly associated with the exposure but not with
the cancer outcomes. In those exceeding the recommended maximum of 14 units/week,
alcohol was causally associated with the risk of head and neck cancer. Only limited evidence
was available for the causal effect of alcohol to specific cancers and these were focused on
cancer of the larynx.
In terms of the observational associations between alcohol consumption and risk of cancer,
our result correspond well to what has been previously reported in a meta-analysis of 572
studies 8. We confirmed the association of alcohol consumption with an increasing
occurrence of cancers in the area of the pharynx (specifically tonsils), as well as colorectal,
larynx and breast cancer. We did not replicate the association with oesophageal or liver
cancers, except for those consuming more than the recommended maximum of 14
units/week, which also showed an increasing number of cancers of the oral cavity and
pharynx, colorectal, pancreas and larynx. Small intestine was not affected by alcohol in any
of the categories tested, in both our work and the published meta-analysis. For individuals
drinking less than the recommended threshold we did not identify any associations of
alcohol consumption with cancer which is in accordance with the published data, except for
oral cavity and pharynx 8,28. A J or U shaped correlation has been suggested between alcohol
and risk of cardiovascular disease 29,30. Here using acute MI we found a protective effect of
alcohol in the overall sample that attenuated in magnitude with increasing category of
alcohol consumption in accordance with the idea of a non-linear relationship.
The rs1229984 variant we selected as the genetic instrument, based on other published MR
work 3,27,25, was strongly associated with weekly alcohol consumption in our sample. The
variant also had other characteristics of a good instrument, such as no evidence of an
association of the genetic variant with any of the probable confounders or with any of the

cancer types tested in those reporting no alcohol consumption per week. Though, the latter
should be considered with caution, since an individual’s report of no weekly alcohol
consumption does not rule out the occasional drink. We did not find any associations
between the variant and the cancer types tested in the overall sample. The lack of
association of the specific variant with stomach cancer agrees with other published data
223132,

though other alcohol associated SNPs have been reported as associated with the

outcome. The rs1229984 variant though has been previously associated with aerodigestive
cancers, including oral and pharynx, larynx and oesophagus cancers 333435. Despite not
identifying the reported associations, our estimated effects per unit/week were very close
to what was reported earlier in a sample of 3,800 cases and 5,200 controls 33, suggesting
that more cancer cases were required to identify some of the associations present. There is
some uncertainty for the association of the specific variants with colorectal cancers with
some studies reporting an association 36 and others reporting no effect 37. We did not find
an association of the variant with any of the lower digestive system cancers. Although the
association of the variant used has been previously shown 3 and confirmed in a different
population 27 we were only able to replicate the result in those reporting an alcohol intake
higher than the recommended threshold.
Although our variant associations failed to identify causal effects reported in the literature,
the instrumental variable regression strongly suggested that alcohol consumption higher
than 14 units/week was causal to the risk of head and neck cancer and MI. The effect on
head and neck cancer appeared to be, at least, partially attributed to an increase risk of
cancer of the larynx. These results correspond well to the published associations of the
genetic variant, described earlier 333435, as well as studies showing that laryngeal cancers are
reversible following alcohol cessation 38. The observed non-significant increase in the risk of
cancer for those consuming alcohol in light and moderate quantities below the
recommended threshold has been previously reported 28 though conflicting observational
results are also available, especially for breast cancer. We did not identify any evidence of
causal association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer, either for the 3,170 UK
Biobank or the 122,977 COGS recorded events, irrespective of genetic instrument used. This
suggests that the relationship between alcohol and breast cancer 39 is at least severely
confounded. Smoking, poor diet and obesity are possible confounders that can also affect
the suggested mechanisms for the link between alcohol and breast cancer 40.

Limitations exist in our study and they can explain some of the inconsistences we see with
published results. The main issue with our data is the lack of statistical power due the
relatively small number of recorded events. Although the study population is very large,
reaching the 500,000 individuals, it includes people that are more affluent, better educated
and in better health than the underlying population of the UK at this age range 41. This is
evident for both the number of cancer events, which are 10-20% lower than expected, and
alcohol consumption, with UK Biobank participants less likely to be alcohol abstainers but
also less likely to drink alcohol every day compared to the general population 41. For liver
cancer, where alcohol is a well-known major factor for primary hepatocellular cancers 42,
our results should be interpreted as not covering the directly alcohol associated carcinomas.
This is due to our removal from the data of those that changed their alcohol consumption
following their doctor’s advice or illness, likely to include these with alcohol related liver
disease, and due to that the vast majority of liver cancer cases attributed to cancer cells
traveling to the liver from other parts of the body, instead of being primary liver tumours.
To summarise, we showed that alcohol consumption causes cancer of the head and neck
and acute myocardial infarction in those exceeding the recommend threshold of 14
units/week. No causal effect of alcohol on cancer was found in those drinking below the
threshold. No causal effect of alcohol was observed between alcohol consumption and
breast cancer in women, in either the individual level data available here or previously
published summary data, suggesting that the observational associations are more likely
confounded. Our results contribute to the accumulating evidence for the danger posed from
excessive alcohol use for some types of cancer, but not others, and the introduction of the
lower 14 units/week threshold as a safe level of alcohol consumption in terms of cancer risk
management.

Table 1: Characteristics of the sample used in the analysis. Summary for the entire sample and per genotype of the rs1229984 SNP is provided. There is no
evidence that the rs1229984 SNP is associated with the selected classical risk factors for cancer. The distribution of alcohol consumption is not normally
distributed and the standard deviations should be interpreted with caution.
