ABSTRACT
Introduction
Biomarkers can be used to assess smoking behaviour more accurately and objectively than
self-report. This study assessed the association between cotinine (a biomarker of smoke
exposure) and later e-cigarette use among a population who were unexposed to e-cigarettes in
youth.
Methods
Young people in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children took part in the study.
We observed associations between cotinine at 15 years (measured between 2006 and 2008
before the wide availability of e-cigarettes) and self-reported ever use of e-cigarettes at 22
(measured between 2014 and 2015 when e-cigarettes were widely available) using logistic
regression. A range of potential confounders were adjusted for (age, sex, body mass index,
alcohol use and passive smoke exposure). Additionally, we adjusted for the young people’s
self-reported smoking status/history to explore potential misreporting and measurement error.
Results
In a sample of N=1,194 young people, cotinine levels consistent with active smoking at 15
years were associated with increased odds of e-cigarette ever use at 22 years (OR=7.24, 95%
CI 3.29 to 15.93) even when self-reported active smoking status at age 16 (OR=3.14, 95% CI
1.32 to 7.48) and latent classes of smoking behaviour from 14 to 16 (OR=2.70, 95% CI 0.98
to 7.44) were included in the model.
Conclusions
Cotinine levels consistent with smoking in adolescence were strongly associated with
increased odds of later e-cigarette use, even after adjusting for reported smoking behaviour at
age 16 and smoking transitions from 14 to 16.

1. Introduction
There are an estimated 3.2 million e-cigarette users (also known as vapers) in the UK (Action
on Smoking and Health, 2018). In 2015, just under 5% of 16 to 24 year olds were estimated
to be current e-cigarette users in the Health Survey for England (Fat, 2016). Evidence
suggests that e-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking (Public Heath England,
2015) and that they are effective in aiding smoking cessation (Hajek et al., 2019). Despite
this, and evidence that frequent e-cigarette use among tobacco-naïve young people is rare
(Collins et al., 2017), concerns have been raised about the potential harms of e-cigarettes and
the use of e-cigarettes by non-smokers.

Previous research exploring associations between tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use among
young people have generally relied on self-report data in cross-sectional surveys and
longitudinal cohorts (Soneji et al., 2017). Self-reports of smoking behaviour have been
shown to be less accurate than objective measures such as cotinine, which can increase
detection of current smokers compared to self-report (Hsieh et al., 2011). The high potential
for measurement error when using self-reports of smoking means it is difficult to draw
conclusions regarding the chronology of events i.e., that smoking preceded e-cigarette use or
vice versa. Thus, there is limited objective evidence for whether smoking is associated with
later e-cigarette use among young people or whether e-cigarette use is associated with later
smoking among young people.

Cotinine is a direct metabolite of nicotine which can be used to assess recent smoke exposure
(half-life of approximately 10-27 hours) (Jarvis, Russell, Benowitz, & Feyerabend, 1988). It
may also serve as an indicator for misreporting of smoking by providing biological evidence
that smoking has occurred when individuals report that they have not smoked (Perezstable,

Marin, Marin, & Benowitz, 1992; Wells, English, Posner, Wagenknecht, & Perez-Stable,
1998; Zhang, Florath, Saum, & Brenner, 2016). For example, one study reported that among
self-reported non-smokers, 6% were misclassified and according to their cotinine levels and
had in fact recently smoked (Perezstable et al., 1992). Therefore, cotinine could provide less
biased evidence of association between smoking behaviour and later e-cigarette use.

To our knowledge, there have been no studies assessing the association of cotinine
measurement in adolescence with e-cigarette use in early adulthood. We therefore examined
the associations of cotinine with later ever e-cigarette use using biochemical verification of
smoking status to further explore previous findings suggesting self-reported smoking is
associated with later e-cigarette use. We also investigated any residual associations after
accounting for self-reported smoking, in order to explore whether objectively assessed
smoking is associated with e-cigarette use over and above self-reported smoking (which may
be subject to misreporting).

2. Methods
2.1. Sample
The study sample consisted of young people from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children (ALSPAC)(Boyd A et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013). A total of 15,454 pregnant
women resident in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery between 1st April 1991 to 31st
December 1992 were recruited, resulting in 15,589 fetuses. Most of these women were
recruited whilst pregnant; however, 913 women who had delivery dates within this time
frame were recruited in later phases when the children were roughly 7 years and older. The
phases of enrolment are described in more detail in the cohort profile update (Northstone et
al., 2019). Of this total sample, 14,901 were alive at 1 year of age (see Figure 1). The study

approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the
Local Research Ethics Committees. Informed consent for the use of data collected via
questionnaires and clinics was obtained from participants following the recommendations of
the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at the time. Figure 1 shows the process from
recruitment to the final sample selection.

2.2. Cotinine as a biomarker for predicting smoke exposure in adolescence
Cotinine is a commonly used biomarker for assessing nicotine consumption (Florescu et al.,
2009). In this study, cotinine levels were measured from blood samples taken in a clinic
assessment of the ALSPAC young people when they were 15 years old (between 2006 and
2008). Cotinine was assayed from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid serum plasma samples
which had been stored at −80 °C and allowed to thaw at room temperature before use.
Cotinine was measured using the Cozart Cotinine Enzyme Immunoassay (Concateno UK,
Abingdon) serum kit (M155B1). All samples, calibrators, and controls were brought to room
temperature before use and were run in duplicate. Where required, samples were diluted
using cotinine-free serum (fetal calf serum). Absorbance was measured
spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450nm.

A presence of 10 ng/ml (nanograms per millilitre of serum) or more of cotinine in the blood
stream is indicative of being an active smoker (Benowitz, 1983). Levels below this but above
0 ng/ml would indicate some exposure to tobacco smoke and levels of 0 ng/ml would indicate
no exposure. The young adults were categorised into three groups (0 ng/ml, no smoke
exposure; between 0 and 10 ng/ml, passive smoke exposure; 10+ ng/ml, active smoking).

Cotinine variables were grouped due to the non-linear association previously found between
cotinine and smoke exposure (Swan, Habina, Means, Jobe, & Esposito, 1993; Zhang et al.,
2016).

2.3. Self-reported smoking in adolescence and early adulthood
Smoking status was assessed in adolescence (16 years) and in early adulthood (22 years). At
16 and 22 years, young people self-reported whether they had ever smoked a cigarette
(yes/no) and the number of cigarettes they had ever smoked (less than 5, 5-19, 20-49, 100
plus). For analysis, the number of cigarettes ever smoked was recoded to include a 0
cigarettes category based on their response to ever smoking (“No” = 0). The frequency at
which the young person smoked at age 16 was also measured (did not smoke, smoked once
ever, used to smoke but did not at time of measure, smoked less than once a week, smoked 16 cigarettes a week, smoked 6+ cigarettes a week, smoked daily). This variable was also
recoded into a binary variable for active (weekly/daily smoking) vs not active (all other
responses) smoking. At 22 years, young people additionally self-reported whether they had
smoked in the past 30 days (yes/no).

Due to the limitations of using secondary data we were unable to acquire measures of selfreported exposure at the same time as measures of cotinine. Self-reported measures were
collected via questionnaire an average of 15 months after cotinine, which was measured at a
clinic session. Time between the measures ranged between 0 and 29 months apart. To
account for the potential variability in smoking behaviour over time in youth, Longitudinal
Latent Class Analysis (LLCA) was also performed using Mplus v8 (Muthen & Muthen, 2017)
to derive smoking classes based on a four-category ordinal variable with categories ‘none’,
‘less than weekly’, ‘weekly’ and ‘daily’ smoking from three questionnaire time points (14, 15

and 16 years), as has been described previously (Heron, Hickman, Macleod, & Munafo,
2011). A 4-class model was selected for the repeated measures of smoking frequency,
comprising smoking behaviour patterns that we refer to as never-smokers (84%),
experimenters (6%), late onset regular smokers (9%) and early onset regular smokers (2%).
These classes are consistent with those derived previously by Heron et al. (Heron et al.,
2011), where non-smokers reported very little or no smoking, experimenters smoked
infrequently (monthly), late-onset regular smokers were individuals who began smoking by
age 14 and were mostly daily smokers by age 16 and early-onset regular smokers were
mostly daily smokers by age 14. Given the very high entropy of the 4-class model,
individuals were assigned to the class for which they had the highest probability of class
membership (modal class assignment) and the latent classes were used as an observed
categorical exposure in further analyses.

2.4. E-cigarette use in adulthood
E-cigarette use was determined by self-report questionnaire during 2014-2015 when the
young people were 22 years old. Study data at 22 years were collected and managed using
REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Bristol (Harris et al., 2009).
Participants were given a yes/no option to the question: “have you ever used/smoked/vaped
an electronic cigarette?” Additional information was collected regarding current (past 30-day)
use of e-cigarettes but these data were not used as the main outcome due to sample size
constraints.

2.5. Covariates
A variety of covariates were included that could impact on the association between
biomarkers of smoking and later e-cigarette use; sex (male/female), age at the time of

questionnaire (quartiles younger to older), parental education (at 32 weeks of gestation;
Degree, A-level, O-level, less than O-level; defined in Supplementary Material), body mass
index (BMI at 15 years old), parental social class (at 18 weeks of gestation; manual, nonmanual), passive smoke exposure (maternal smoking at 12 years old) and alcohol use
(whether the young person had drunk a whole alcoholic beverage in the past 30 days at 15
years old). Cannabis (at 15 years) was included as a covariate in supplementary analyses.
Self-reported smoke exposure (whether the young person had ever smoked, the number of
cigarettes smoked, whether they were active smokers at 16 years, and latent classes of
smoking transitions between the ages of 14, 15 and 16 [latent classes: never smokers,
experimenters, late onset regular smokers, early onset regular smokers; within class
probabilities are shown in Supplementary Figures S1-S4]) was also included in further
models.

2.6. Statistical analyses
Analyses were completed in Stata SE 15.1 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX USA).
Differences in sociodemographic characteristics between the young people who had never
used an e-cigarette versus those who had ever used an e-cigarette by 22 years were assessed
using a chi square test for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables.
Associations between cotinine at age 15 and ever e-cigarette use at age 22 years were
assessed in a series of logistic regressions. Cases with missing data (exposure, outcome or
covariate data) were not included in the analyses.

Analysis of cotinine data was performed on both categorised (main text) and continuous
(supplementary) data. Emphasis has been placed on the analysis of the categorical data for
two reasons: 1) the continuous cotinine data were positively skewed and attempts at

transforming the data did not sufficiently address the issue; and 2) non-linear relationships
between cotinine and smoke exposure may mean that continuous models might not be
informative (Swan et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 2016).

Three models were used to analyse the associations between cotinine and later e-cigarette use
before adjusting for self-reported smoking; the basic model (Model 1) adjusted for sex and
age at cotinine sample collection; Model 2 additionally adjusted for BMI, socio-economic
position (social class, maternal and paternal education) and alcohol use; Model 3 additionally
adjusted for passive smoke exposure (maternal smoking) at 12 years. A further four models
were used to analyse the association while adjusting for self-reported smoking. These further
models were as Model 3 and additionally adjusted for ever smoking at age 16 (Model 4a),
number of cigarettes smoked in their lifetime at 16 (Model 4b), active smoking
(daily/weekly) at age 16 (Model 4c), or smoking transitions from age 14 to 16 (Model 4d).
On average, the time between the measure of cotinine at 15 years and the self-reported
measure of smoking status at 16 years was 15 months, with a range of 0 to 29 months. Given
the short half-life of cotinine and the potential variability in smoking behaviour over time in
youth, Models 4a-4c also adjusted for the time (months) between cotinine measure and selfreport at 16. Any associations observed in Models 1-3 were expected to attenuate to the null
in Models 4a-4d in the absence of measurement error in the self-report.

Model fit was assessed using likelihood ratio tests in which the models including and
excluding the exposure (cotinine) were compared. Substantial differences between the two
models indicate that the model including cotinine was more predictive of the outcome (i.e.,
the model was a good fit).

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore whether time between measures of cotinine
and self-reported smoking behaviour may have influenced the results. We explored whether
restricting the analysis to those with a time gap of 18 months or less between the smoking
measures would affect the interpretation of the results.

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of Participants
At 22 years, the question regarding ever e-cigarette use was completed by 3,965 participants,
955 (24%) of whom responded that they had previously used/smoked/vaped an e-cigarette.
Of those who had ever used an e-cigarette, 111 (12%) stated that they were currently using
one. Table 1 contains the participants’ sociodemographic data stratified by their use of ecigarettes (ever/never) at 22 years. There was strong evidence for differences between groups
in terms of sex, BMI, alcohol use and smoking behaviour (at 16 and 22 years). Among never
users of e-cigarettes at 22 years, 37% had ever smoked at 16 and 48% had smoked at 22 years
(self-reported). For ever e-cigarette users at 22 years, 74% had ever smoked at age 16 and
95% had ever smoked at age 22 (self-reported). There was also weak evidence that maternal
education differed between groups.

3.2. Cotinine levels and e-cigarette ever use at 22 years
The main results for the associations between cotinine and e-cigarette ever use can be found
in Table 2. Levels of cotinine indicative of passive smoke exposure at 15 years were not
clearly associated with ever e-cigarette use at 22 years (p > .28). Levels of cotinine indicative
of active smoking at 15 years were associated with a 10-fold increase in the odds of having
ever used e-cigarettes at 22, compared with those with no smoke exposure (unadjusted OR
10.47, 95% CI 4.88 to 22.46, p < .001). This positive association remained following

additional adjustment, although was weakened when adjusting for self-reported smoking
behaviour at age 16 (ever smoking, OR 5.00, 95% CI 2.25 to 11.14, p < .001; number of
cigarettes smoked, OR 2.35, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.62, p = .055; active [weekly/daily] smoking,
OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.32 to 7.48, p = .010; and smoking transitions, OR 2.70, 95% CI 0.98,
7.44, p = .054). Including cotinine in the model improved the model fit for Models 1, 2, 3, 4a
and 4c (p < .001), but not 4b (likelihood ratio = 3.87, p = .14) or 4d (likelihood ratio = 3.91, p
= .14). The evidence of an association was much weaker in the analysis of the continuous
data (Table S1). Including cannabis as a covariate further attenuated the association but some
residual association was still seen (Table S2).

3.3. Self-reported smoking and potential misreporting
Although strong associations were seen between self-reported smoking behaviour and
smoking behaviour determined by cotinine (Table S3), discrepancies indicate that
misreporting may have occurred (Table 3). Only 56% of those who had cotinine levels
indicative of being an active smoker self-reported daily smoking. 19% of those indicated to
be active smokers by their cotinine levels reported that they were current non-smokers and
25% reported their smoking behaviour as weekly or less. Conversely, only 36% of those who
self-reported being daily smokers also had cotinine levels indicating active smoking.

3.4. Transitions in smoking and ever e-cigarette use at 22 years
The association among the different latent classes of transitions in smoking between 14 and
16 years and e-cigarette use at 22 years (adjusting for all model 3 covariates, including
cotinine) are shown in Table 4. Experimenters and late onset regular smokers had increased
odds of ever using an e-cigarette at 22 years. There was no clear difference in odds of ever ecigarette use between early onset regular smokers and never smokers.

3.5. Sensitivity analyses
We next evaluated whether the discrepancies between self-reported smoking and cotinine
levels were due to the fact that cotinine measures were taken between 0 and 29 months after
the 16 year questionnaire on smoking behaviour in which smoking status was self-reported,
and therefore due to changing smoking habits in that time rather than misreporting. Although
the evidence of a residual association after adjusting for self-reported smoking status was
weaker, there was still some evidence of an association in the sensitivity analysis (Table S4),
indicating that the residual association is not due to the time gap between the measures. The
restriction reduced the sample size and therefore the power to detect an association, so seeing
a consistent residual association (albeit with weaker statistical evidence) is supportive of our
interpretation of the results.

4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of the association between cotinine in
adolescence and later e-cigarette use in early adulthood. Cotinine levels that are indicative of
active smoking at age 15 are strongly associated with increased odds of having ever used an
e-cigarette at age 22. Although the strength of evidence of this association was weakened
after adjustment for self-reported smoking behaviour at age 16 (assessed based on ever
smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked, active smoking and latent classes of smoking),
some evidence of association remained, indicating that some measurement error had occurred
which could potentially be due to misreporting.

The evidence provides further support (using biochemical verification) to research findings
suggesting that smoking is associated with later e-cigarette use. There was little evidence for
13

an association between cotinine levels indicative of passive exposure with later e-cigarette
use. This reflects previous research suggesting e-cigarette use is more common in smokers
than non-smokers (Bauld et al., 2017; Pearson, Richardson, Niaura, Vallone, & Abrams,
2012). As causality cannot be inferred from associations, we cannot determine whether
smoking in adolescence causes future e-cigarette use. However, if there is a true causal
association the results provide some indication of the direction of causality due to the timing
of the data collection. When the data were collected (2006-2008), e-cigarettes were newly
available and in 2013 (over 5 years later when the first evidence of use among young people
began to emerge) only 4.6% of 11-18 year olds had ever used e-cigarettes in Great Britain
(Eastwood et al., 2015). Therefore, it is very likely that these biomarker profiles reflect
smoking behaviour in adolescence without confounding from e-cigarette use, given that ecigarettes were not widely used among youths when the biomarker levels were measured.
Furthermore, this evidence does not support the theory that e-cigarettes act as a one-way
bridge to smoking in young people as has previously been suggested (Miech, Patrick,
O'Malley, & Johnston, 2017); the relationship is more complex.

If self-reported smoking and biomarker indications of smoking were both accurate and no
mis-reporting had occurred, the association between cotinine levels and later e-cigarette use
should have been fully attenuated when adjusting for self-reported smoking. The residual
association indicates that smoking might be misreported in adolescence. Particularly, underreporting of smoking may be an issue when assessing self-reported smoke exposure; nearly
20% of the young people in this study who were identified as having cotinine levels
indicating active smoking reported not actively smoking. Previous research has also found
that misreporting of smoking in young people is common (Jarvis, Fidler, Mindell,
Feyerabend, & West, 2008). There are many possible explanations for misreporting when

gathering self-report data on smoking behaviour from young people, such as social pressures,
fear of punishment or recall bias (Brener, Billy, & Grady, 2003). Therefore, research using
self-report data to explore the gateway hypothesis (that e-cigarettes act as a gateway to
smoking) may not be reliable as young people reporting to be ‘non-smokers’ who use ecigarettes may have previously smoked cigarettes.

Measurement error could also explain the residual association between smoking and later ecigarette use after adjusting for self-reported smoking. While there was an improvement in
the prediction of e-cigarette use when cotinine was included in the models with ever and
active smoking at age 16, there was less improvement when cotinine was added to models
including more detailed assessment of smoking intensity and duration. This suggests that in
future studies, in the absence of biomarker verification when investigating the association
between e-cigarette use and smoking, more detailed self-report measures (e.g. transitions)
should be used rather than cruder measures (e.g. ever use) to avoid measurement error.

In addition, 36% of individuals identified as non-smokers by cotinine levels self-reported
being smokers. This discrepancy could have arisen from measurement error in cotinine
(given its short half-life (Jarvis et al., 1988), the measure may have been taken too early/late)
or the cut-off used to determine whether the young people’s cotinine levels were indicative of
active smoking or not may also have been too high. Despite 10 ng/mL frequently being used
as the cut-off with high sensitivity and specificity (Murray, Connett, Lauger, & Voelker,
1993), some studies have used cut-offs from 1 ng/mL (Smith, Robinson, Khan, Sosnoff, &
Dillard, 2014) up to 25 ng/mL (Kim, 2016). These discrepancies could be explained by
changes in the young person’s smoking status between the measures of self-reported smoking

15 months. However, we adjusted for the time between measures in sensitivity analyses that
indicated that the remaining association after adjusting for smoking status is unlikely to be
due to the time gap between the measures. We also accounted for variability in smoking
behaviour over time by assessing the latent classes, which captured transition in smoking
between age 14 and 16.

Focussing on this model (Model 4d), we found that early onset regular smoking was not
clearly associated with later e-cigarette use but experimentation and late onset regular
smoking was, even when cotinine was taken into account. This finding suggests an additional
element of smoking behaviour in predicting future e-cigarette use, which is not captured by
cotinine measures. In particular, results indicate that those individuals who have smoked for a
longer period of time (early onset smokers) are less likely to try e-cigarettes than
experimenters and late-onset smokers, and are no more likely to try e-cigarettes in the future
than never smokers. Further research should explore this as those who start smoking earlier
may be more addicted to nicotine and may need more encouragement to quit whether that be
by using e-cigarettes or other methods.

4.1. Implications of findings
Longitudinal studies exploring the gateway hypothesis often rely on self-reported smoking
history to exclude those who have already been exposed to smoking at baseline (prior to ecigarette use) but it is also important to explore whether differences in biomarker levels that
indicate smoking are evident. Individuals who claim to have used e-cigarettes before smoking
cigarettes may be inaccurately reporting information and this misreporting could be captured
using biomarker verification. However, now that e-cigarettes are more popular and have been
shown to be a common correlate of cigarette smoking (Chapman & Wu, 2014), replicating

these results and avoiding problems of reverse causation may prove difficult as e-cigarettes
can contain nicotine and therefore their use will increase cotinine levels.

The association between cotinine and e-cigarette use remained after including a range of
potential confounders in the model. However other sources of nicotine may be confounding
this association. Cannabis users in the UK often smoke cannabis with tobacco and may or
may not report this as smoking. When cannabis use was included in the model the association
between smoking and later e-cigarette use was somewhat attenuated. We did not include
cannabis in the main analysis due to the potential for cannabis acting as an indicator of
misreporting rather than a confounder. The role of cannabis in the relationship between
smoking and e-cigarette use should be further explored.

Ideally, we would have further explored the potential bias resulting from misreporting of
smoke exposure in studies exploring whether e-cigarettes act as a gateway to smoking by
restricting our analyses to those who claimed they were never smokers but were regular ecigarette users at 22 years. We were unable to do this due to the limited number of young
people in this study who fit those criteria. Only 1% of the sample had tried e-cigarettes but
claimed to have never smoked at 22 years and less than 1% of the sample were current ecigarette users and claimed to have never smoked a cigarette. The low number of nonsmoking regular e-cigarette users is reflected in recent statistics from the England-based
Smoking Toolkit Study (West, Beard, & Brown, 2018) and the literature exploring the
gateway hypothesis (e.g. Primack, Soneji, Stoolmiller, Fine, and Sargent (2015) identified
only 16 non-smoking ever e-cigarette users among 694 participants).

In summary, cotinine levels consistent with active smoking in adolescence are associated
with later e-cigarette use even after adjusting for some measures of self-reported smoking
behaviour. This could have implications for studies assessing the gateway hypothesis that
rely on self-report measures of smoking behaviour. Future studies investigating prediction of
e-cigarette use should investigate use of more detailed self-report and objective measures.

Cotinine was treated as a categorical variable in these analyses. Passive exposure is defined
as levels exceeding 1 ng/ml in blood samples (up to 9 ng/ml). Active exposure is defined as
cotinine levels exceeding 10 ng/ml in blood samples. The basic model (model 1) was
adjusted for age and sex. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for socioeconomic status, BMI
and alcohol. Model 3 was additionally adjusted for passive smoke exposure (maternal
smoking at 12 years). Models 4a-4c were as model 3 and additionally adjusted for selfreported measures of smoking and the difference in age between the self-report and cotinine
measures. Model 4a adjusted for ever smoking at age 16. Model 4b alternatively adjusted for
number of cigarettes smoked by age 16. Model 4c alternatively adjusted for active smoking
(daily/weekly) at age 16. Model 4d was as Model 3 and adjusted for classes of smoking
transitions; early onset regular smokers, late onset regular smokers, never smokers and
experimenters categorised using data from 14 to 16.
