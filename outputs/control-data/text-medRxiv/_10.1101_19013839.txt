ABSTRACT

Background
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer and contributes to
a number of other cancers that affect both men and women. Vaccines exist that offer
protection against the most common cancer-causing HPV types. In England, a
school-based vaccination programme for girls has been in place since 2008 but
vaccine coverage rates have declined since its introduction. Understanding variation
between schools and between local authorities may help to inform quality
improvement and guide policy development and commissioning.

Methods
Cross-sectional, ecological analysis of vaccine uptake among 164 schools
representing 13,127 children in eight out of ten local authorities in Greater
Manchester. Logistic mixed effects regression models were used to test for
associations between school level factors and vaccine uptake, while allowing for
variation between local authorities.

Results
In multivariable mixed effects models, lower vaccination rates were associated with:
increasing numbers of children eligible for vaccination; increasing proportions of
children eligible for free school meals; increasing proportions of children with English
as an additional language; Ofsted ‘inadequate’ ratings; Christian and Muslim faith
schools; independent schools and special schools.

Conclusions
Consistent with previous studies on vaccine uptake, this study identifies a number of
factors that are associated with uptake of the school-based HPV vaccine
programme. We also show that local authority variation remains after adjustment for
the mix of schools in each area. This evidence may be used to guide vaccine
providers, commissioners, and policymakers who want to increase uptake of the
school-based HPV vaccine.

INTRODUCTION

Human Papillomavirus
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a large family of over 300 double-stranded DNA
viruses that infect the mucosa and skin (Bzhalava, Eklund, and Dillner 2015;
McBride 2017). An estimated 30% of women will be infected with HPV within two
years of becoming sexually active (Woodman et al. 2001). Point prevalance
estimates in unvaccinated populations range from 35% to 45% (Howell-Jones et al.
2012; Baudu et al. 2014). Approximately 80% of people will be infected with HPV in
their lifetime (Syrjanen et al. 1990; Chesson et al. 2014).
Most HPV infections clear within two years (Woodman et al. 2001; Muñoz et al.
2004). However prolonged infection is associated with warts and some types of
cancer. At least 12 strains of HPV are known to cause cancer. HPV infections are
responsible for an estimated 99% of cervical cancer, as well as being associated
with penis, vulvovaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers (McBride 2017).

The HPV vaccine programme in England
Several vaccines are available that are effective in preventing HPV infections. These
include bivalent (covering oncogenic HPV 16 and 18), quadrivalent (HPV 16 and 18
plus HPV 6 and 11 that cause genital warts) and nonavalent (covering HPV types 6,
11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) vaccines.
The introduction of HPV vaccine programmes has been associated with marked falls
in the prevalence of oncogenic HPV types, precancerous cervical lesions in girls,
and genital warts in both sexes (Mesher et al. 2016; Palmer et al. 2019; Drolet et al.
2019).

In England, the HPV vaccine has been offered to girls in school year 8 and 9 (ages
12 - 14) since 2008. In 2019 the school HPV vaccine programme was expanded to
include boys. The school-based programme uses a two-dose vaccination schedule,
with a minimum six-month gap between the first and second dose. For children
under 15 years old, two doses are considered necessary for full protection (Public
Health England 2019a).
The target for uptake of the HPV vaccine in England is 80%. Uptake among girls was
initially high at 90% nationally, but has since fallen to below 85% (Public Health
England 2018). However, national figures mask variation in uptake between local
authorities (local government areas in England). Within England uptake among girls
in 2017/18 varied from 67.8% in Kensington and Chelsea to 95.3% in Rotherham
(Public Health England 2019b).
Understanding the variation between local authorities is important for monitoring and
improving performance. However, variation between local authorities may be
explained by the make-up of the schools within their areas. Previous research has
established a number of school-level factors that are associated with uptake
(Fletcher et al. 2019; Tiley et al. 2019). These include the proportion of children
eligible for free school meals (an indicator of poverty), the proportion of children for
whom English is an additional language, school faith, the effectiveness of the school
management (as measured by Ofsted, the schools inspectorate in England), and the
type of school.
However, these previous studies have not considered the potential variation between
local authorities, or the extent to which this variation is explained by variation in
schools between areas. The aim of this study is to understand what factors are

associated with variation in HPV vaccine uptake between schools in Greater
Manchester, and whether the variation between local authorities in uptake of the
HPV vaccine in Greater Manchester is explained by variation in school level factors,

METHODS

Study design
This is an ecological, cross-sectional study using routinely available data.

Setting
Greater Manchester is a city region in the North West of England. In 2018 it had a
population of approximately 2.8 million (Office of National Statistics 2019). It is made
up of ten local authorities. The population is more deprived than average for England
(Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership 2017; Public Health
England 2019b).

Data Sources and variables
School level data on vaccine uptake was provided by eight out of ten local authorities
in Greater Manchester. This data was extracted from local Child Health Information
Systems. Data was not available for Salford and Wigan local authorities. Schools
where data on key variables was missing were excluded from analysis.
Data on school characteristics was downloaded from the Department for Education’s
website (Department for Education 2019). Data on school performance was
downloaded from the Ofsted website (Ofsted 2019). Where data was missing in the
downloaded datasets, we checked Government and Ofsted websites and manually
added this data if it was available. Table 1 summarises the variables used in this
study.

Statistical Analysis
Vaccination rates were calculated as the number of children receiving two doses of
HPV vaccine divided by the number of children eligible for vaccination in the school.
This included vaccinated children who received the vaccine through their GP rather
than in school.
We linked uptake data with DFE and Ofsted data using school unique reference
numbers. Where unique reference numbers were not available, data was matched
on school names.
We used univariable and multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models
(schools nested within local authorities) to test for associations between school level
variables and HPV vaccine uptake. Local authority random intercepts were included
in the multivariable model to understand residual variation between local authorities
after accounting for school-level variation and to adjust for non-independence of
error terms (as schools within the same local authority are likely to be more similar
than those more geographically distant). Independent variables were centred and
scaled to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 to aid model fitting. This means that the
odds ratios reported reflect the change in the odds of vaccination for every one
standard deviation change in the independent variable.
Previous studies have found an interaction between the proportion of children
eligible for free school meals (an indicator of levels of poverty and deprivation among
children at the school) and the proportion of children with English as a second
language. We include this interaction term here for comparability with other studies.
Statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.5.3 (R Core Team 2019). The
tidyverse and readxl packages were used for data manipulation (Wickham 2017;

Wickham and Bryan 2019) and the lme4 package was used for fitting mixed-effects
logistic regression models (Bates et al. 2015). Logistic regression models were fitted
to the proportion of eligible children receiving two doses of the HPV vaccine by using
the number of eligible children (the denominator) as weights in the regression model.

Ethical approval
Ethical approval was not necessary for this study because it was conducted using
only aggregated data and is a service evaluation.

RESULTS
There were 174 schools in total, comprising 13,159 eligible pupils. 10 schools were
excluded because there was missing data for key variables. This left 164 schools
that were included in the study, comprising 13,127 pupils.
The overall vaccination rate in schools across the eight local authority areas included
in the study was 81.1% (range 0% to 100%, interquartile range 71.1% to 89.6%).
The vaccination rate for local authorities ranged from 67.2% to 89.8%.

In unadjusted analyses, Jewish faith was associated with higher odds of vaccination
among pupils (although it is important to note that there was only one Jewish faith
school in the data set). The proportion of children eligible for free school meals, the
proportion of children for whom English is an additional language, academy and free
schools, and special schools were associated with lower odds of vaccination among
pupils. Vaccination uptake did not vary significantly by Ofsted rating, but schools for
which Ofsted ratings were not available (independent schools that are inspected by
the Independent Schools Inspectorate) appeared to have higher odds of vaccination
among their pupils.
In multivariable analyses, a model with local authority random effects performed
significantly better than a single-level model without local authority random effects
(Chi squared = 366.6 on 1 degree of freedom, p < 0.001). In a model containing only
local authority random intercepts and no school-level explanatory variables, the
standard deviation of the random intercepts was 0.445. Adding the school level
variables increased the standard deviation of the random intercepts to 0.503.
Together, this suggests that most variation between local authorities in HPV vaccine
uptake that is not explained by the mix of the schools within their areas based on the
school characteristics that we have used in this study.

In the multivariable random intercepts model, Jewish faith and voluntary or
foundation school status was associated with higher odds of vaccination. Lower odds
of vaccination were associated with: increasing numbers of children eligible for
vaccination, a higher proportion of children eligible for free school meals, a higher
proportion of children for whom English is an additional language, Ofsted
‘inadequate’ ratings, Christian faith, and independent or special school status. In
addition, while ‘inadequate’ was the only category of Ofsted rating that was
significantly associated with lower odds of vaccination among pupils, there appears
to be a trend towards decreasing odds of vaccination across the other Ofsted
ratings.
There was a significant interaction between the proportion of children eligible for free
school meals and the proportion for whom English was an additional language. This
interaction was negative, indicating that its effect was to exacerbate an already
negative association between those two factors and HPV vaccine coverage. The
total effect of a one standard deviation increase in both the proportion eligible for free
school meals and the proportion for whom English is an additional language was an
odds ratio of 0.621.

DISCUSSION

Vaccine uptake
Overall, the HPV vaccine coverage rate remains above the national target of 80%,
although the falls in coverage seen in previous years appear to have continued.

Variations in HPV vaccine uptake between schools
This study identifies a number of school-level characteristics that appear to explain
some of the variation in HPV vaccine uptake between schools.
Consistent with other studies on school-based vaccine uptake, the proportion of
children in a school who are eligible for free school meals and the proportion for
whom English is an additional language were associated with lower vaccine uptake
(Fletcher et al. 2019). In addition, we found a significant interaction between these
two variables, such that in schools with both a high proportion of children eligible for
free school meals and with English as an additional language, HPV vaccine
coverage was lower still. This differential uptake is likely to result in inequalities in
cancer rates between more and less affluent children and children of recent
migrants. As earlier studies have pointed out, the effect of English as an additional
language may be explained by those children’s parents having English as an
additional language and this being a barrier to communication and parental consent.
Previous studies have found that more knowledge about HPV was associated with
greater intent to vaccinate among parents in Northern England (Sherman and Nailer
2018). This suggests that translation of vaccination information leaflets may be an
appropriate strategy to increase parental consent for vaccination among families
whose first language is not English. Alternatively, in both more deprived families and

families where English is a second language, attitudes to vaccination may be
different than in more affluent and English speaking families. One systematic review
of barriers to HPV vaccination found that parental beliefs about the effect of
vaccinating against a sexually transmitted infection on sexual behaviour may also
affect parental consent (Holman et al. 2014).
The lower vaccination rates observed in Christian and Muslim faith schools may also
reflect attitudes to vaccination against what is primarily a sexually-transmitted
infection. This finding is consistent with other studies (Fletcher et al. 2019; Tiley et al.
2019). However, the international evidence base on the effect of religion on attitudes
to HPV vaccination is mixed, with some studies finding that religious beliefs are
associated with higher vaccination rates (Shelton et al. 2013), other studies finding
no association (Brabin et al. 2006; Lenselink et al. 2008), and others still finding
religious beliefs were associated with lower vaccination rates (Marlow, Waller, and
Wardle 2007; Marlow et al. 2009). UK-based studies tend to find a negative
association between religious faith and HPV vaccine acceptability, and qualitative
studies suggest that conservative social attitudes may play a role (Marlow, Waller,
and Wardle 2007; Marlow et al. 2009; Laura et al. 2009; Gordon, Waller, and Marlow
2011).
The higher vaccination rates associated with Jewish schools observed here are at
odds with the findings of a broader study (Tiley et al. 2019), but there was only one
Jewish school in this dataset. This suggests that there may be important variation
within categories of faith schools, and it may be possible to work with faith schools
with high levels of uptake to understand how best to improve vaccine uptake among
other schools that share the same faith.

Another difference between this study and other studies of school-based vaccine
uptake was the observation that increasing numbers of pupils eligible for vaccination
was associated with lower vaccination rates. It is worth noting that the effect, while
statistically significant, was small (a 1 standard deviation increase in the number of
eligible pupils was associated with a 0.3% relative decrease in the odds of
vaccination among eligible pupils).
Consistent with previous research, we found that schools with the worst overall
effectiveness rating (‘inadequate’) had lower vaccine uptake rates (Fletcher et al.
2019). While the effect was statistically significant only for the lowest Ofsted rating,
the pattern was of decreasing odds of vaccination with decreasing overall school
effectiveness ratings. The lack of a significant association between the ‘good’ and
‘requires improvement’ Ofsted ratings and HPV vaccine uptake may therefore reflect
a type II error, and a larger study may be needed to understand whether there is an
overall trend for lower uptake to be associated with worse Ofsted effectiveness
ratings.
The variables identified here are unlikely to explain the fall in the uptake of the HPV
vaccine. To the extent that data is available, there is little evidence that these
variables have changed over time in a way that would explain the fall in vaccination
rates. However, it is possible that the effect of these variables over time has
changed. For example, while the proportion of children who are eligible for free
school meals across Greater Manchester has decreased since 2014 (Public Health
England 2019b), it is possible that schools with more children eligible for free school
meals have seen bigger falls in coverage. Further analysis using longitudinal data
would be needed to test this hypothesis.

Variations in HPV vaccine uptake between local authorities
As local authorities are responsible for commissioning school nursing and other early
years health services, a better understanding of variation between local authorities
may help to guide local and national policy and commissioning.
Despite meeting the national target overall, three of the eight local authorities studied
here were below the 80% target. The results presented here suggest that this
variation is not explained by variation in the make-up of schools within each area
according to the school characteristics included in this study.

Strengths of this study
This study is the first to our knowledge to examine school-level factors that affect
variation in HPV vaccine uptake while allowing for variation between local authorities
in uptake. This approach can help to understand variation in vaccination between
local authorities, while adjusting for the make-up of schools in each area. This
approach can support better assessment of the performance of HPV vaccine
delivery within each local authority area. The use of mixed models also helps to
adjust for the fact that HPV vaccine uptake rates in schools in the same local
authority area may not be independent.
We also consider a broader set of school-level characteristics than previous studies
(Fletcher et al. 2019; Tiley et al. 2019). In particular, where Tiley et al use area-level
deprivation scores, we use the proportion of children who are eligible for free school
meals within each school’s student population. This may better reflect the level of
poverty among the children who attend the school.

Limitations of this study
This is an ecological study and as such, the results here should be treated with
caution. Further research using individual level data would allow for more confident
inferences about the role of pupil and family factors on vaccine uptake. This would
complement qualitative and survey evidence on factors affecting HPV vaccine
consent (Sherman and Nailer 2018; Laura et al. 2009; Gordon, Waller, and Marlow
2011).
The study is also limited in its sample of local authority areas. Data was only
available for eight of the ten local authorities in Greater Manchester. However the
results are broadly consistent with a study that included 42 out of 152 upper-tier local
authorities in England (Tiley et al. 2019).
There are other school-level factors that were not included in this study that may also
influence vaccine uptake. For example, we did not include data here on school
expenditure per pupil, as this was not available for all the schools in the data set.
This study also suffers from a lack of local authority-level explanatory variables. The
inclusion of such data may help to explain the apparent variation between local
authorities that is not explained by school or individual and family factors. Such data
might include configuration of and spending on vaccine providers, school nurses,
and other childrens health services.
As the school-based HPV vaccine programme in England has now been running for
over ten years, longitudinal studies of HPV vaccine uptake are possible. The use of
longitudinal datasets may allow for a better understanding of the school and local
authority level factors that affect HPV vaccine uptake among communities in
England.
