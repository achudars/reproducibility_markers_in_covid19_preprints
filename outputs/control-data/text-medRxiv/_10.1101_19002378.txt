Abstract
Word count: 400/400
The multi-faceted nature of Alzheimer’s disease means that multiple biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-β,
tau, brain atrophy) can contribute to the prediction of clinical outcomes. Machine learning methods
are a powerful way to identify the best approach to this prediction. However, it has been difficult
previously to model nonlinear interactions between biomarkers in the context of predictive models.
This is important as the mechanisms relating these biomarkers to the disease are inter-related and
nonlinear interactions occur. Here, we used Gaussian Processes to model nonlinear interactions when
combining biomarkers to predict Alzheimer's disease conversion in 48 mild cognitive impairment
participants who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease and 158 stable (over three years) people with
mild cognitive impairment. Measures included: demographics, APOE4 genotype, CSF (amyloidβ42, total tau, phosphorylated tau), neuroimaging markers of amyloid-β deposition ([18F]florbetapir)
or neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume, brain-age). We examined: (i) the independent value
each biomarker has in predicting conversion; and (ii) whether modelling nonlinear interactions
between biomarkers improved prediction performance.
Despite relatively high correlations between different biomarkers, our results showed that each
measured added complementary information when predicting conversion to Alzheimer's disease. A
linear model predicting MCI group (stable versus progressive) explained over half the variance (R2 =
0.51, P < 0.001); the strongest independently-contributing biomarker was hippocampal volume (R2 =
0.13). Next, we compared the sensitivity of different models to progressive MCI: independent
biomarker models, additive models (with no interaction terms), nonlinear interaction models. We
observed a significant improvement (P < 0.001) for various two-way interaction models, with the
best performing model including an interaction between amyloid-β-PET and P-tau, while accounting
for hippocampal volume (sensitivity = 0.77).
Our results showed that closely-related biomarkers still contribute uniquely to the prediction of
conversion, supporting the continued use of comprehensive biological assessments. A number of
interactions between biomarkers were implicated in the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease
conversion. For example, the interaction between hippocampal atrophy and amyloid-deposition
influences progression to Alzheimer's disease over and above their independent contributions.
Importantly, nonlinear interaction modelling shows that although for some patients adding additional
biomarkers may add little value (i.e., when hippocampal volume is high), but for others (i.e., with
low hippocampal volume) further invasive and expensive testing is warranted. Our Gaussian

Introduction
Rapid increases in the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease over the 21st century are predicted
(Brookmeyer et al., 2007), hence there is a pressing need to develop disease modifying treatments.
Research diagnostic criteria have been proposed, reflecting key biological facets of Alzheimer’s such
as cerebral amyloid-β deposition, altered levels of proteins in CSF and neurodegeneration (Sperling
et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014). It is hoped that these biological characteristics can be measured in
people prior to symptoms manifesting, identifying at-risk individuals and enabling interventions to
be targeted at slowing disease progression and delaying symptom onset.
This goal is complicated by the highly heterogeneous nature of the Alzheimer’s population
(Tatsuoka et al., 2013). For example, although the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques is a defining
pathological feature of Alzheimer's, many cognitively-normal older adults also have elevated
amyloid-β plaque levels (Villemagne et al., 2011). Seemingly, amyloid-β deposition is not solely
sufficient to cause dementia (Aizenstein et al., 2008). Furthermore, while CSF tau was found to
positively correlate with severity of cognitive impairment (Shaw et al., 2009), increased CSF tau
appears to indicate neuronal injury and neurodegeneration in different diseases (Schoonenboom et
al., 2011). Indeed, a broad range of potential biomarkers are available for Alzheimer’s. This includes
hippocampal volume, whole-brain volume and as well as apparent ‘brain-age. Previous work has
shown that that having an older-appearing brain is associated with conversion to Alzheimer’s within
three years, and is more statistically informative than hippocampal volume (Franke et al., 2010;
Franke and Gaser, 2012; Gaser et al., 2013). We have previously used the brain-age paradigm to
demonstrate abnormal brain-ageing after a traumatic brain injury, in treatment resistant epilepsy and
Down’s syndrome (Cole et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2017a; Pardoe et al., 2017). Brain-age also relates
to cognitive performance and mortality risk in older adults from the general population (Cole et al.,
2018), suggesting that this metric reflects something of the brain’s sensitivity to more general health.
The range of available biomarkers indicates the biological heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s and more
work is needed to incorporate this heterogeneity into predictive models of disease progression. This
should improve specificity and better enable treatment decisions to be made at the individual level,
to aid in clinical practice and evaluate potential treatments.
To improve specificity in the use of biomarkers for staging Alzheimer’s, multiple measures are likely
to be necessary. This way, complementary information from different biological sources can be
combined to build a more comprehensive picture of the underlying diseases processes, and capture
disease heterogeneity more accurately. An essential consideration when combining these multiple

sources of information is how they interact. For instance, while amyloid-β deposition may precede
and potentially drive subsequent neurodegeneration in some instances, the magnitude of amyloid-β
deposition is likely to be key. An individual may be ‘positive’ for amyloid-β on a PET scan but
remain below some latent threshold for neuronal or glial loss. Once over that threshold,
neurodegeneration might occur, though if they remain below this threshold, neurodegeneration may
be driven by other factors, or not occur at all. This accords with Jack and colleagues (2016) proposed
multi-state transition model, with two distinct pathways to Alzheimer’s; one where cerebral amyloidβ deposition occurs prior to neurodegeneration, and one where neurodegeneration occurs prior to
amyloid-β deposition. In this second pathway, individuals may never accumulate sufficient amyloidβ to cross the threshold to amyloid-mediated neurodegeneration. However, they may have been
exposed to negative genetic or environmental factors, not necessarily Alzheimer’s related, that have
influenced the rate of age-associated change in brain structure. On this back-drop of poorer brain
health, potentially only minimal Alzheimer’s-specific pathology is necessary to drive disease
progression. The presence of such thresholds in how two biological processes interact is inherently
nonlinear, however, nonlinear relationships are under-studied in neurology and remain in the domain
of systems biology, for example in modelling cell signalling networks (Sung and Hager, 2012).
Nonlinear models that incorporate thresholds, plateaus and other complex patterns are theoretically
better positioned to detect such relationships, and machine learning analysis offers a range of tools
for modelling nonlinearities.
Machine learning is an increasingly popular approach to predict conversion from MCI to
Alzheimer’s using biomarkers (Sarica et al., 2017; Pellegrini et al., 2018). Machine learning places
emphasis on out-of-sample prediction and is readily able to incorporate high-dimensional data, hence
is well-suited to making individualised predictions of disease outcomes. However, only a limited
number of studies have specifically modelled interactions between biomarkers and crucially, these
have only been linear interactions (Fortea et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Caroli et al., 2015; Pascoal et
al., 2017a; Pascoal et al., 2017b; Bilgel et al., 2018). For example, Pascoal and colleagues (2017b)
showed that being positive for both amyloid-β-PET and CSF p-tau was associated greater cognitive
decline and greater risk of disease progression in people with MCI, then being positive for either
biomarker in isolation. However, when dichotomising the continuous measures of amyloid-β-PET
and CSF p-tau into positive or negative, it is not possible to detect more complex relationships
between biomarkers. Hence, this motivates research into alternative methods that enable both linear
and nonlinear interactions to be modelled.

One approach to modelling nonlinear interactions is Gaussian Processes, a family of models that
assigns a nonparametric Gaussian smoothing function to each biomarker (Figure 1). These ‘kernels’
can then be combined, allowing effects of non-linearities in both additive (i.e., main effects) and
interactions to be modelled. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the conversion from MCI to
Alzheimer’s can be better predicted by modelling biomarkers interactions (linear or non-linear), than
by using the additive sum of independent effects on disease progression.
Using the ADNI dataset, we analysed people with stable and progressive MCI to investigate: (i) the
independent value each biomarker has in predicting conversion; and (ii) whether modelling nonlinear
interactions between biomarkers could improve the fit of classification models that predict
conversion to Alzheimer’s. We included multiple biological indices, to capture different facets of
Alzheimer’s: APOE genotype, CSF measures of amyloid-β42, total tau and p-tau, PET measure of
amyloid-β deposition, and structural MRI measures of global ‘brain age’ and of hippocampal
volume.

Material and methods
A high-level overview of the methods used in the study is included in Figure 1.

Participants
Participants were drawn from the publicly-available ADNI dataset. Inclusion criteria included the
availability of all biomarkers (genetic, fluid, PET, MRI), a diagnosis of MCI at baseline imaging
assessment and the availability of clinical follow-up three years after the imaging assessment to
determine disease progression. Stable MCI participants still met the criteria for MCI after three
years; progressive MCI participants met the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of dementia at or before
the three-year assessment. In total, n = 206 people with MCI were included in the analysis; stable
MCI n = 158 (age range 55-89 years, median age=71.60 years), progressive MCI n = 48 (age range
55-84 years, median age = 73.85 years). Further participant details are included in Table 1.
ADNI is a longitudinal observational study investigating whether serial brain imaging, clinical, and
neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of AD. Detailed
information regarding the ADNI study’s procedures, including participant inclusion and exclusion
criteria, and the complete study protocol can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/. ADNI was
launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner,
MD. ADNI is the result of efforts of co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and
private corporations with participants being recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S and Canada.

To date, there are over 1500 adults, aged between 55 and 90, that participated in its three studies
(ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, ADNI-2). The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET
and other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment could be combined to
measure the progression of MCI and early Alzheimer’s disease.

Biomarker analysis
Biomarkers: Genetics
APOE genotype was determined from a 10ml blood sample taken during study screening and sent
overnight to the University of Pennsylvania ADNI Biomarker Core laboratory for analysis. The
APOE genotype of each participant was recorded as a pair of numbers indicating which two alleles
were present; either ε2, ε3 or ε4.
Biomarkers: Fluid
Samples of 20ml of CSF were obtained from participants by a lumbar puncture with a 20- or 24gauge spinal needle, around the time of their baseline scan. All samples were sent same-day on dry
ice to the University of Pennsylvania ADNI Biomarker Core laboratory. There, levels of the proteins

(amyloid-β42, total tau, and p-tau) were measured and recorded, as described previously(Shaw et al.,
2009). By design, only a subset of ADNI participants had measurement of CSF levels.
Biomarkers: PET
Cerebral amyloid-β deposition was indexed using the PET tracer [18F]florbetapir (F-AV45). PET
imaging was performed within two weeks of the baseline clinical assessments, as described
previously (Jagust et al., 2015). In brief, four late-time five-minute frames are co-registered and
averaged. The resulting image is converted to a 160x160x96 voxel static image with voxel
dimension of 1.5mm3. Finally, an 8mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel was applied
(corresponding to the lowest resolution scanner used in the study). These primary data were
downloaded from the ADNI database and used in the subsequent analyses.
F-AV45 data were nonlinearly registered into Montreal Neurological Institute 152 space (MNI152
space) using DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007). Initially the structural MRI images were segmented into
grey matter and white matter using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) software package
(University College London, UK) and registered to a group average template. The group average
template was then registered to MNI152 space. The F-AV45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr)
image for each participant was registered to the corresponding T1-weighted MRI using a rigid-body
registration. Finally, the individuals’ DARTEL flow field and template transformation was applied
without modulation resulting in F-AV45 images in MNI152 space. The normalised maps were
spatially smoothed (8mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel). A neuroanatomical atlas
(Tziortzi et al., 2011) and a grey-matter probability atlas in MNI152 space were employed to
calculate regional SUVr values. SUVr values were quantified using the grey matter cerebellum as the
reference region (defined as the intersection between the cerebellum region from the anatomical atlas
and the grey-matter atlas, thresholded at p>0.5). The mean uptake value for cerebellar grey matter
was obtained and each image was divided by this to generate an SUVr image for each participant.
Finally, an average cortical SUVr value was obtained by calculating the mean SUVr value for all
cortical regions (weighted by regional volume).
Biomarkers: Structural MRI
Three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired at either 1.5T (ADNI-1) or 3T (ADNI-2
and ADNI-GO) suing previously described standardized protocols at each site (Jack et al., 2008). All
MRI scans were pre-processed using SPM12. This entailed tissue segmentation into grey matter and
white matter, followed by a nonlinear registration procedure using DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007) to

MNI152 space, subsequently followed by resampling to 1.5mm3 with a 4mm Gaussian smoothing
kernel.
Processed grey matter and white matter images were then entered in the Pattern Recognition for
Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) software (Schrouff et al., 2013). Using a previously trained model
that predicts chronological age from structural neuroimaging data, as per our previous work (Cole et
al., 2015; Cole et al., 2017a; Cole et al., 2017c; Cole et al., 2018), we generated a brain-predicted
age value for each participant. This step used a Gaussian Processes regression model with a linear
kernel, with processed neuroimaging data as the independent variables, and age as the dependent
variable. The training dataset used to define the model included n = 2001 health adults aged 18-90
years; further details have been reported previously (Cole et al., 2017b). Finally, we generated brainPAD values; chronological age subtracted from brain-predicted age (i.e., the model predictions).

Processes based models; D) Partitioning of total variance explained into independent and shared variance
explained for each biomarker; Gaussian Processes that allow just for main effects of biomarkers to be
modelled are constructed by adding all the univariate squared exponential kernels corresponding to each
biomarker. Full-order interactions between all biomarkers considered are captured through a single
multivariate squared exponential kernel; Full set of statistics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC) are
computed for each replicate. Paired t-tests are conducted between accuracy scores stemming from main
effects models and a model containing a multivariate kernel to assess if the increase in generalisation to
unseen data is statistically significant.

Statistical analysis
Hierarchical partitioning of variance
We examined the independent contribution of each biomarker for distinguishing between stable and
progressive MCI participants in a multivariate model, using hierarchical partitioning of variance
(Chevan and Sutherland, 1991). Here, a hierarchical series of logistic regression models are fit, with
all possible combinations of biomarkers. By comparing the variance explained by each model across
all other models, an unbiased approximation of the variance attributable to each variable can be
derived, both that independent of all other variables and that shared with other variables (due to the
correlations between them).
Hierarchical partitioning of variance was carried out using the R package ‘hier.part’ with the
following variables: age, sex; genetics (APOE4 genotype); CSF (amyloid-β42-CSF, total tau, p-tau);
PET (amyloid-β-PET); structural MRI (hippocampal volume, brain-PAD). The number of variables
was limited to nine as per Olea and colleagues (2010) to avoid inconsistent results. Thus, robust
estimates of independent variance explained are obtained for each biomarker, which enabled
assessment of the utility of including each biomarker when adjusting for all other biomarkers.

Multivariate biomarker models
We considered multiple statistical models, all with group (i.e., stable or progressive MCI) as the
outcome (i.e., dependent) variable and with age, sex and APOE genotype as covariates. Each of the
six imaging or fluid biomarkers were evaluated separately, alongside three different multivariate
models, and a full model containing all biomarkers:
i.

Hippocampal volume + brain-PAD + amyloid-β42-CSF

ii.

Hippocampal volume + brain-PAD + amyloid-β-PET

iii.

Hippocampal volume + amyloid-β-PET + p-tau

iv.

Full model (hippocampal volume + brain-PAD + amyloid-β42-CSF + p-tau + total tau +
amyloid-β-PET)

Gaussian Processes classification
Gaussian Processes are a supervised learning algorithm, that has found applications in many fields
including our previous neuroimaging research (Cole et al., 2015), due to its Bayesian and nonparametric properties. The principal behind Gaussian Processes is that a measured (dependent)
variable is modelled by defining a multivariate Gaussian distribution, hence we can view them as
being a distribution over functions (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006).
To obtain Gaussian Process models where our predictor variables are independent, we assigned to
each biomarker an individual squared exponential kernel, and subsequently all kernels are added
together to derive a global kernel. To introduce interactions between biomarkers, we used all the
covariates within the same squared exponential kernel. Duvenaud and colleagues (2011) proposed
that this kernel construction defines an m-order interaction over covariate space, where m is the total
number of covariates used in building the kernel. For example, two-way interactions were
constructed by assigning the respective two biomarkers to a single kernel, subsequently adding this
to the list of univariate kernels specific to each biomarker. For all models we used the non-sparse
version of the Scalable Variational Gaussian Processes Classifier (Hensman et al., 2015).
Bootstrapping to adjust for class imbalance
The two groups of MCI patients were of differing size (progressive MCI n = 48, stable MCI n =
158), resulting in a class imbalance. To counter this imbalance, we subsampled the majority class
(i.e., stable MCI) to generate a balanced dataset. To reduce the impact of sampling bias on this
approach, we used bootstrapping (100 iterations) to randomly subsample the stable MCI group to
create 100 different subsets, each compared with the entire progressive MCI group. Importantly,
within each bootstrap, we used 10-fold stratified cross-validation to generate classification
predictions for each participant. Sensitivity, specificity, (balanced) accuracy, area under the curve
(AUC) and log likelihood values were calculated for each bootstrapped dataset. Values were then
averaged across the 100 bootstrapped iterations.
Model comparisons
Two-way or three-way interactions were assessed by their relative improvement in log likelihood
values compared to their corresponding main effects model. A paired t-test is used to test for
differences, with the significance level set at 0.05. A list of the two-way and three-way interactions
tested can be found in Table 2. To determine whether Gaussian Processes for classification resulted
in improvements over less complex linear models, we performed the same classification task using
logistic regression, with the same combination of different input variables and interaction terms

(Supplementary Table S2). When considering model performance, we opted to focus on sensitivity
to detecting progressive MCI as the chief criteria, under the assumption that a false-negative
classification of stable MCI, is clinically more deleterious than a false positive.

Results
A total of n = 158 stable MCI participants and n = 48 progressive MCI participants were included in
our study. The two different groups are well matched in age and gender. In terms of APOE4 status,
there is a significant difference, with 70.83% of progressive MCI being APOE4 positive, in
comparison with 39.24% for stable MCI. Group differences were observed for all other biomarkers
(Table 1).

Biomarkers capture independent facets of Alzheimer’s progression risk
Hierarchical partitioning of variance was used to determine unique contributions of different
predictor variables as well as their shared contribution towards prediction of conversion from MCI to
Alzheimer’s after three years. The total variance explained by this additive model was R2 = 0.51, P <
0.001. Independent R2 values were: age = 0.028, sex = 0.004, APOE4 = 0.069, amyloid-β42-CSF =
0.063, total tau = 0.054, p-tau = 0.045, amyloid-β-PET = 0.048, hippocampal volume = 0.126, brainPAD = 0.076. A substantial proportion of the variance was shared between variables, indicating that
these biomarkers reflect some common as well as unique processes underlying progression from

Figure 2. Independent and shared variance across biomarkers in predicting conversion to
Alzheimer's
A) Correlation matrix of numerical biomarkers, showing Pearson’s r values in balanced sub-sample of stable
and progressive MCI participants (n = 96). B) Estimates of independent and shared variance for individual
biomarkers in a logistic regression model with conversion to Alzheimer’s labels as the outcome variable and
age, sex, APOE genotype, total tau, P-tau, amyloid-β42-CSF, amyloid-β-PET, hippocampal volume and
brain-PAD as predictors. Estimates derived from hierarchical partitioning of the variance, with blue bars
indicating independent (i.e., unique) variance attributable to each biomarker and yellow indicating variance
shared with one or more other biomarkers.

Logistic regression does not benefit from interaction terms
When using logistic regression to classify stable and progressive MCI patients, performance was
moderately accurate, with balanced accuracies ranging from 0.67-0.72 (see Supplementary Table
S2). Notably, for all models, classification sensitivity (range 0.61-0.65) was substantially lower than
specificity (range 0.86-0.88), indicating that the logistic regression was better at identifying stable
MCI patients than progressive MCI patients. When comparing the models containing interactions
terms with their additive counterparts, t-tests showed than none of the interaction models were
significant. This indicates that using standard logistic regression methods, where interactions are
linear, there is no improvement in classification performance when including interaction terms.

Nonlinear interactions between hippocampus and amyloid-based biomarkers
Different models were compared to assess the influence of including nonlinear interactions when
classifying stable from progressive MCI (Table 2). For the models using biomarkers separately, Ptau showed the best sensitivity (0.729), while amyloid-β42-CSF had the highest accuracy (0.760).
However, the AUC values for all these independent measures was broadly equivocal (AUCs range
0.722-0.749), except for brain-PAD, which was lower (AUC = 0.637). For the additive models of
main effects, sensitivity ranged from 0.712-0.770, including the full model containing all

biomarkers. When adding interaction terms for Model 1, we found that a bivariate interaction
between hippocampal volume and amyloid-β42-CSF significantly improves model fit (i.e.,
significantly lowers log-likelihood). For Model 2, a two-way interaction between hippocampal
volume and amyloid-β-PET also improved model fit. For Model 3, all three interactions improved
model fit. That is, amyloid-β-PET by P-tau; amyloid-β-PET by hippocampal volume; P-tau by hippocampal
volume. Finally, the inclusion of a three-way interaction between hippocampal volume, amyloid-β-

PET and CSF P-tau also improved model fit for Model 2 and Model 3, but not Model 1. Notably, the
sensitivity (range 0.708-771) and specificity (range 0.749-0.848) of the interaction models was
similar to those of the additive main-effect models, despite the reductions in log-likelihood.

Visualising nonlinear interactions: contour plots
The greater performance improvement occurred when including a two-way nonlinear interaction
between amyloid-β-PET and hippocampal volume when adjusting for P-tau (Model 3). To
investigate the relationships between these three biomarkers we used ‘contour’ plots to compare the
decision boundaries between the main effects model, including interaction terms (Figure 3). A
decision boundary can be defined as the point in measured space at which the classification is
equivocal, in other words where there is greatest statistical uncertainty about which class (stable MCI
or progressive MCI) an individual belongs to. The further away from the decision boundary, the
more certain the model is that an individual is either stable MCI or progressive MCI, depending on
the direction. In Figure 3, red regions are points in space with a high certainty of being progressive
MCI, blue regions the equivalent for stable MCI. The decision boundaries are the white-coloured
regions where the blue and red contours converge. These contour plots are analogous to
topographical maps of mountainous terrain; strong colours represent mountain peaks, while white
areas represent valleys, the decision boundaries.
From inspection of the contour plots it is evident that for different levels of P-tau (based on this
illustrative tertiary split), the relationship between hippocampal volume and amyloid-β-PET
changes. In particular, for participants with medium P-tau levels, the contours are a better fit to the
distribution of stable (represented by crosses on Figure 3) and progressive MCI participants
(represented by dots) for the interaction model compared to the additive model. In practice, an
individual patient could be located in this biomarker space, by using measurements of P-tau,
hippocampal volume and amyloid-β-PET. A clinician could use this plot gain additional
understanding of whether an individual patient more closely resembles a stable or progressive MCI
patient, or whether they sit near the decision boundary. The ‘sharper’ the contrast between the red

nonlinear compared to the additive model depicted in Figure 3.

Discussion
Here, we modelled nonlinear interactions between a panel of biomarkers (neuroimaging, genetic,
CSF) to predict disease progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease. Statistical models that
included nonlinear interaction term explained conversion risk moderately better than additive linear
models (in terms of model fit), though the influence of these interaction models of the sensitivity to
progressive MCI was negligible. Importantly, our panel of biomarkers all independently explained a
proportion of the variance in a logistic classification model. Though perhaps unsurprising, given
evidence of the influence of these biomarkers in Alzheimer’s (Jack et al., 1999; Gaser et al., 2013;
Xu et al., 2013; Caminiti et al., 2018), this justifies the inclusion of different sources of information,
despite the evident shared variance (i.e., bivariate correlations) between biomarkers. This is even the
case for measures of amyloid; whereby the PET-derived and CSF-derived measures were correlated r
= -0.54. Crucially, our results show that a proportion of the non-shared variance between these two
biomarkers still relates to disease progression. This is in line with previous findings (Mattsson et al.,
2014), which showed that amyloid-β42-CSF and amyloid-β-PET provide partially independent

information about a wide range of Alzheimer’s measures. While a practitioner’s decision about
whether to acquire PET or CSF measures of amyloid for a single patient are likely influenced by cost
and invasiveness, statistically including both will improve predictive accuracy.
We found that the nonlinear interaction between amyloid-β-PET and hippocampal volume
significantly increases our model fit on unseen data, suggesting an element of synergy between the
two biomarkers. By inspecting the model’s ‘contours’ (Figure 3), we observe that this increased
model fit is attributable to ‘sharper’ decision boundaries. The probability of conversion for people
with low hippocampal volume and high amyloid-β-PET values, was higher when compared to
probability values obtained from a model where the biomarkers are treated independently, suggesting
that modelling interactions explains more variance and decreases statistical uncertainty. Our finding
concurs with the results from Bilgel and colleagues (2018), where an interaction was found between
hippocampal volume and amyloid-β-PET in predicting cognitive decline, in their study of n = 171
older adults from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Additionally, we found evidence that a
three-way interaction between amyloid-β-PET, hippocampal volume and P-tau further improves
model fit compared to a main-effects model, suggesting a three-way interaction between these
biomarkers. We also found evidence of nonlinear interactions between hippocampal volume and:
CSF P-tau, amyloid-β-PET, amyloid-β42-CSF. This supports the idea that there is a ‘threshold
effect’ on hippocampal volume, whereby larger hippocampal volumes are associated with stable
MCI, irrespective of changes in other biomarkers, while with smaller hippocampal volumes, the
readouts of other biomarkers are more predictive of progressive MCI. Potentially, the presence of
intact hippocampal networks enables functional compensation to ameliorate the deleterious nature of
amyloid and tau deposition, however, once hippocampal atrophy crosses a certain threshold, the
consequences of abnormal protein deposition become clinically manifest.
Due to the nonparametric nature of Gaussian Processes, prediction probabilities in biomarker ‘space’
can be illustrated using contour plots, which provide visual information about the relationship
between groups of biomarkers. When examining the contour plots and respective decision
boundaries for Model 1, we observed high statistical ‘certainty’ in classifying participants as stable
MCI in the case of high amyloid-β-CSF values, more specifically values above 192pg/mL.
Interestingly, this corresponds to the threshold proposed by Shaw and colleagues (2009), who also
used ADNI. Models including high amyloid-β-CSF achieved high levels of specificity, with the
individual amyloid-β-CSF model having a specificity of 0.895. This means that amyloid-β-CSF is

useful for indicating that an individual is stable MCI, but given the sensitivity of 0.625, is less
valuable in identifying cases of progressive MCI.
The performance of our Gaussian Processes method for predicting MCI conversion was comparable
to previous approaches (see Rathore et al., 2017 for review). For example, Cheng and colleagues
(2015) used a multimodal manifold-regularized transfer learning with semi-supervised learning on
MRI, PET scans and CSF features to achieve AUC = 0.852 (accuracy = 80.1%, sensitivity = 85.3%,
specificity = 73.3%). Korolev and colleagues (2016) used the probabilistic multiple kernel learning
classifier, obtaining AUC = 0.87 (accuracy = 80%, sensitivity = 83%, specificity = 76%). Moradi
and colleagues (2015) achieved an AUC of 0.90 (accuracy = 82%, specificity = 74%, sensitivity =
87%) using a univariate structural MRI biomarker alongside a variety of cognitive scores. Besides
these, Hor and colleagues (2016) implemented a Scandent tree approach on T1-weighted MRI ROI
and global measures stemming from both FDG-PET and AV45-PET scans (accuracy = 0.815,
sensitivity = 0.831, specificity = 0.803, AUC = 0.872). In the current analysis, our best performing
model (in terms of sensitivity to progressive MCI) reached sensitivity = 0.771, specificity = 0.756,
accuracy = 0.764, AUC = 0.826. Direct comparison of these values is complicated by the varying
sample sizes in each study, generally based on biomarker availability (e.g., fewer participants had
amyloid-PET scans). Our model performance results are sufficiently accurate to enable reasonable
scrutiny of relationship between variables. Nevertheless, no published model to date has reach
sufficiently high sensitivity to warrant clinic adoption for the prediction of developing Alzheimer’s
in people with MCI, where values of 95% or greater are likely to be necessary to influence clinical
decision making.
Our study has some important strengths and weaknesses. Ours is the first study to model nonlinear
interactions between biomarkers in predicting MCI conversion to Alzheimer’s, properly utilising the
available information in a more biologically-valid manor. Here, we focused on model prediction,
unlike previous work on interactions in MCI conversion (Fortea et al., 2014; Pascoal et al., 2017b),
that relied on making inferences based solely on p-values. Recently, Bzdok and colleagues (2018a)
highlighted the diverging end results between classical statistics and machine learning, with the
former drawing population level inferences from samples, whereas the latter is seeking to find
generalisable predictive patterns. In further work, Bzdok and colleagues (2018b) showed that low pvalues do not necessarily translate to generalisable biomarkers in out-of-sample data. Our model
offers a robust and interpretable framework by which we can visualize how biomarkers dynamically
interact and how those interactions affect the decision boundaries of classifying participants as stable
MCI or progressive MCI. For example, this framework could be used in designing clinical trials to

assess how much change in a given biomarker must occur for an individual to move to from being at
low risk from conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's to being at high risk (i.e., moving from blue
regions to red in Figure 3).
Weaknesses of the current study include the limited sample size and lack of a replication dataset.
While we did use ‘held-out’ data to test model generalisability, we were unable to test the predictive
performance of our models to truly independent data. This is one key limitation of multi-modality
prediction models, as beyond ADNI, datasets containing MRI, amyloid-PET and CSF measures are
challenging to acquire and generally not openly-available to the research community. Another
limitation is that we focused on the MCI stage of the disease. Evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s
pathogenesis commences years prior to any cognitive symptoms, so future work should focus on
younger, at-risk groups, in order to maximise the window for interventions prior to Alzheimer’s
disease manifestation. Furthermore, the diagnostic stages defined in ADNI are made clinically, while
the gold standard for AD diagnosis is post-mortem. Potentially, some of the clinical assessments are
inaccurate.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that multiple underlying neurobiological processes both act
independently and interact in a nonlinear fashion during progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s. By
capturing atrophy (hippocampal volume), amyloid-β deposition (using PET) and neurofibrillary
tangle formation (CSF P-tau) in a nonlinear interactive model, can better fit models to predict
conversion than independent effects alone, though main-effects multi-modality model still offer
reasonable performance. The impact of modelling nonlinear interactions implies that threshold
effects and pathological ‘plateaus’ are present during disease progression and that measuring
multiple biomarkers will be necessary to best predict outcomes. The current data do not suggest
clinically meaningful benefits of nonlinear-interaction models yet, though our novel visualisation
method (contour plots) could be helpful in clinical contexts and provides strong face validity for our
approach. Finally, multi-faceted therapeutic interventions are likely to be necessary, as simply
influencing the levels of a single biomarker will be insufficient to modify the disease in all
individuals.
