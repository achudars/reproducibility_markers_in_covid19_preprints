Summary
Background Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating,
and fatal disease caused by deposition of aggregated transthyretin amyloid in multiple organs and
tissues. Highly variable disease penetrance has made it difficult to predict disease onset and
progression. Clinically validated, non-invasive plasma biomarkers may facilitate earlier diagnosis and aid
monitoring of disease progression.
Methods Plasma levels of >1000 proteins were measured in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with
polyneuropathy who received either placebo or patisiran in the phase 3 APOLLO study (NCT01960348)
and in a cohort of healthy individuals. The impact of patisiran treatment on the time profile of each
protein was determined by a linear mixed model at 0, 9, and 18 months. Neurofilament light chain (NfL)
protein was further assessed using an orthogonal quantitative approach.
Findings A significant change in the levels of 66 proteins was observed with patisiran vs placebo, with
change in NfL, a marker of neuronal damage, most significant (p<10–20). Analysis of the changes in
protein levels demonstrated that the proteome of patients treated with patisiran trended towards
healthy individuals at 18 months. Plasma NfL levels in healthy controls were four-fold lower than in
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (16·3 [SD 12·0] pg/mL vs 69·4 [SD 42·1] pg/mL,
p<10–16). Levels of NfL at 18 months increased with placebo (99·5 [SD 60·1] pg/mL) and decreased with
patisiran treatment (48·8 [SD 29·9] pg/mL). At 18 months, improvement in modified Neuropathy
Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7) in patisiran-treated patients significantly correlated with a reduction in
NfL levels (R=0·43, p<10–7).
Interpretation The observed correlation of NfL reduction with patisiran treatment and improvement in
mNIS+7 suggests it may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage and polyneuropathy in hATTR

Introduction
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating, and fatal
disease caused by pathogenic mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that result in accumulation of
amyloid fibrils throughout the body including in the heart, peripheral nerves, and gastrointestinal
tract.1,2 This accumulation leads to damage of organs and tissue that can include peripheral
sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy, leading to decreased quality of
life and eventually death.3 The majority of patients with hATTR amyloidosis develop a mixed phenotype
of both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy as a result of this multisystem involvement.4-6 hATTR
amyloidosis affects approximately 50 000 people worldwide and has a median survival of 4·7 years
following diagnosis,7 with a reduced survival of 3·4 years for patients presenting with cardiomyopathy.8
Due to variability of the initially affected tissues, age of onset, and penetrance of hATTR amyloidosis, it is
difficult to predict disease onset and progression in individual patients. Thus, there is a need for
improved understanding of the disease as a whole, including the ability to identify, monitor, and
effectively treat patients.
Diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis remains challenging, including identification of patients with manifest
disease, and ascertaining if and when asymptomatic carriers with pathogenic TTR mutations become
symptomatic.9,10 Penetrance of the disease in carriers varies widely by region11 and TTR mutation.7
Additionally, since TTR fibrils aggregate and deposit in tissues over time, subclinical nerve damage is
likely to occur prior to presentation of overt symptomatology. One measure used to assess severity and
progression of polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR amyloidosis is the modified Neuropathy
Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7).12 mNIS+7 is a composite score (range: 0–304) which assesses sensory,
motor, and autonomic nervous system functions, with a higher mNIS+7 score indicating worse
neuropathy. While mNIS+7 is considered a helpful tool, it can be burdensome to administer, so

advancements are necessary to improve our ability to diagnose hATTR amyloidosis earlier and assess its
severity with greater objectivity. Discovery of novel plasma biomarkers associated with disease
progression could potentially provide minimally invasive measures that facilitate earlier patient
diagnosis, improved monitoring of disease progression, and response to therapeutic intervention.
Due to the low prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis, there has been a limited number of clinical proteomic
studies conducted in hATTR amyloidosis patient samples. A study was conducted to investigate plasma
protein profiles in patients presenting with hATTR amyloidosis relative to healthy controls; however, the
sample size was relatively small.13,14 The pivotal phase 3 APOLLO study (NCT01960348) was a
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patisiran, a lipid nanoparticle-delivered RNA
interference (RNAi) therapeutic that reduces serum TTR levels by inhibiting hepatic synthesis of the
disease-causing mutant and wild-type (wt) TTR proteins.6,15 In APOLLO, patisiran-treated patients
experienced improvements in the primary endpoint (mNIS+7) and all secondary endpoints with an
acceptable benefit:risk profile.6 The objective of this study was to use plasma samples collected during
APOLLO to evaluate the change in circulating proteins in response to patisiran treatment in patients with
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, with the aim of identifying potential clinical biomarkers of
hATTR amyloidosis that correlate with treatment response. The clinical utility of biomarkers could
conceivably include monitoring of disease progression and treatment effect; biomarker development
could potentially lead to an early diagnostic parameter or predictor of when disease may become
manifest in asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic TTR mutations.

Methods
Study design and participants
The present study includes analysis of plasma samples in a subset of patients enrolled in the APOLLO
study. During the APOLLO study patients received either patisiran 0·3 mg/kg or placebo intravenously

every 3 weeks for 18 months.6 Patients were included in this analysis if they completed the APOLLO
study and had plasma samples available at baseline and 9 and 18 months for biomarker assessment.
Healthy control samples (n=57) were collected under IRB-approved protocols separately and were age-,
sex-, and race-matched to the baseline demographics of the APOLLO patients included in this analysis
(Dx Biosamples, LLC, San Diego, CA).
Plasma measurement of biomarkers
Plasma samples of patients enrolled in APOLLO were collected according to the study protocol prior to
dosing.6 Levels of 1161 proteins were measured using 13 human panels containing 92-plex
immunoassays (Olink Proteomics, Watertown, MA) with intra-assay coefficients of variation ranging
from 2% to 14% and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranging from 5% to 26%. Olink® uses a
proprietary proximity extension assay technology to combine a detection step involving oligonucleotidelabelled antibodies with a proximity-dependent DNA polymerisation step and a real-time quantitative
PCR amplification step to measure relative levels of multiple biomarkers simultaneously. Relative
protein levels are reported as normalised protein expression (NPX) values which are on a log2 scale.
Subsequent quantitative measurements of neurofilament light chain (NfL) were made using an
ultrasensitive single molecule array method, in duplicate,16 in a subset of patients where sufficient
volume of plasma was available (n=112 patisiran-treated, n=47 placebo-treated), at baseline and 18
months. All NfL values were within the linear ranges of the assay except for two measurements, which
were excluded.
Statistical analysis
To determine which protein levels changed the most over time as a result of placebo vs patisiran
treatment, a linear mixed model regression analysis was performed for each protein to determine if

there was a significant differential time profile based on treatment. The Wilkinson notation
representation of the model is given by: “Protein
NPX~Treatment+Time+Treatment:Time+Age+Sex+(1|Patient)”, where the response Protein NPX
represents protein levels, Treatment denotes whether the patient was administered placebo or
patisiran, Time is a numeric quantity representing 0, 9, or 18 months, Treatment:Time is the interaction
term, age/sex are additional covariates, and individual patients (Patient) are assigned random
intercepts. The model was regressed for each protein using the fit linear mixed-effects model (fitlme)
function (Matlab 9.3) and the coefficients and p values associated with the Treatment:Time interaction
coefficient were stored and plotted.
Principal component analysis is a statistical procedure used to convert a set of observations that may be
correlated into a set of linearly uncorrelated values, called principal components. This transformation
results in the first principal component accounting for the largest possible variance in the data, with
each subsequent principal component accounting for less variance. Here the analysis is used to display
the levels of 66 proteins in various cohorts of individuals (healthy control, baseline APOLLO,
APOLLO/placebo, and APOLLO/patisiran) on a simple two-dimensional plot by plotting the two principal
components that explain most of the variability in the data.
All box plots are based on standard metrics, namely the minimum value, maximum value, lower and
upper quartiles, and median value. Outliers are denoted as those values that are more than 1·5 times
the interquartile range) above the third quartile or below the first quartile. Plots were made using the
Python Matplotlib graphics environment. All correlation analysis was performed using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient and all comparisons of means between the two groups were performed using the
student t-test in R. Principal component analysis was performed using Python’s sklearn package, and the

Results
In order to compare proteomes, subjects comprised 136 patisiran-treated and 53 placebo-treated
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy from the APOLLO study, and 57 healthy controls
that were age-, sex-, and race-matched to the APOLLO patients (figure 1; table 1). The APOLLO patient
cohort was demographically representative of the patients enrolled in APOLLO.6

Multiple plasma proteins differ significantly between placebo- and patisiran-treated patients
Plasma levels of 1161 unique proteins were analysed using a proximity extension assay. A linear mixed
model was used to determine the impact of patisiran treatment on the time profile of each protein’s
plasma level by analysing levels at baseline and 9 and 18 months. A total of 66 proteins were found to
show a significant change in levels in placebo vs patisiran-treated patients over time (p<4·18×10–5;
applying Bonferroni correction), of which NfL was the most significant (figure 2; p=3·95×10–21). This
analysis revealed that upon treatment with patisiran levels of some proteins increased (eg, neutral
ceramidase) whereas levels of other proteins decreased (eg, NfL, R-spondin 3, coiled-coil domain
containing 80). Many of the proteins affected by patisiran treatment have not been described as
biomarkers (table 1; appendix); however, one previously described biomarker of cardiac health, N7

terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) showed a significant decrease (p=7·02×10–14) upon
patisiran treatment. The NT-proBNP levels predicted by the proximity extension assay data and linear
mixed model were consistent with those measured using an orthogonal method in the APOLLO study.6

Effect of disease progression and treatment on overall plasma proteome signature
Principal component analysis was used to elucidate whether there was a systemic plasma proteomic
shift in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, and whether there was a subsequent reversal following
treatment with patisiran. The 66 most significant proteins found in the mixed model analysis (table 1;
appendix) were compared in samples from healthy controls and baseline samples from patients with
hATTR amyloidosis. Projecting each individual’s data onto the first two principal components that
account for the most variance revealed a distinct separation between healthy controls and patients with
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy at the APOLLO baseline (figure 3A), with most of the separation
being driven by the first principal component (PC1). The proteomes of placebo-treated patients at 18
months were projected onto the same principal components resulting in a leftward movement along
PC1 of the 99·9% confidence ellipse, suggesting that the proteome of placebo-treated patients was
further separating from healthy controls (figure 3B). At 18 months, it was found that plasma proteomes
of patisiran-treated patients were more similar to those of healthy subjects compared with placebotreated patients (figure 3C). Since there is significant heterogeneity in the proteome of patients at
baseline, individual patient trajectories were also captured in 66-dimensional space. For each patient,
the course of their disease progression or reversal was defined using two metrics, one representing the
rate (ф) and a second representing whether the proteome moved away from or towards the healthy
controls (ϴ; see figure 3D legend). Plotting these two parameters clearly separated patisiran- and
placebo-treated patients (figure 3E), emphasising the distinct differences in the proteomes of the two
groups at 18 months.

Plasma NfL is increased in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and
decreases with patisiran treatment
NfL was the most significantly changed protein in the analysis when comparing placebo- and patisirantreated patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and was therefore investigated in more
detail. Patients diagnosed with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy had greater than four-fold
higher levels of NfL in their plasma at baseline relative to healthy controls (figure 4A; log2 scale). As
expected, plasma NfL levels at baseline did not differ between the patisiran and placebo groups. The
patisiran-treated group showed a significant decline in plasma NfL levels at 9 months that was sustained
at 18 months whereas plasma NfL levels in the placebo group increased at 9 months relative to baseline
and this level was sustained at 18 months (figure 4B). At 18 months, placebo-treated patients had twofold higher NfL plasma levels than patients treated with patisiran. Treatment with patisiran significantly
lowered NfL levels in patients with hATTR amyloidosis towards levels observed in healthy controls.
To assess variability between individuals, plasma NfL levels were plotted over time for each patient
receiving placebo (figure 4C) or patisiran (figure 4D) treatment. Consistent with the general trend in the
previous analysis, patients receiving placebo showed increasing plasma NfL levels over time, whereas
patients receiving patisiran demonstrated decreasing plasma NfL levels. Changes in plasma NfL levels
were correlated with mNIS+7 score at 18 months (R=0·4; figure 4E) indicating that decreasing plasma
NfL levels are associated with an improvement in polyneuropathy. Notably, no correlation was observed
between plasma NfL levels and mNIS+7 score at baseline (figure 1; appendix). Additionally, patients
belonging to the pre-specified cardiac subpopulation of the APOLLO study (defined as baseline left
ventricular wall thickness ≥13 mm in the absence of a history of aortic valve disease or hypertension)6
saw similar elevation of plasma NfL levels (figure 4F) to patients who only had symptoms of
polyneuropathy, suggesting that NfL can serve as a biomarker of polyneuropathy in patients regardless
of cardiac involvement.

The initial NfL measurements were validated using a widely used ultrasensitive single molecule
quantitative assay to provide absolute plasma concentrations of NfL in healthy controls and hATTR
amyloidosis patient samples from APOLLO at baseline and 18 months (figure 5). There was a very strong
correlation between the two assays used to measure plasma NfL levels (figure 5A; R=0·96). Using the
quantitative assay, the mean NfL level in healthy individuals was 16·3 pg/mL, consistent with published
reports (SD 12·0 pg/mL; figure 5B).17 Patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy had plasma
NfL levels that were approximately four-fold higher at baseline, 69·4 pg/mL (SD 42·1 pg/mL), which,
after 18 months, decreased following patisiran treatment (48·8 pg/mL ± 29·9 pg/mL) and increased in
the placebo group (99·5 pg/mL ± 60·1 pg/mL). One outlier with NfL plasma levels of 747 pg/mL in the
patisiran-treated group was excluded from the calculations (figure 5B and 5E) as this individual
experienced a study-unrelated cerebral infarct at month 17 that may have caused the observed
elevations of NfL. Consistent with the initial plasma NfL measurements (figure 4), measurements using
the quantitative assay demonstrated a strong correlation between change in mNIS+7 and change in
plasma NfL levels at 18 months for each patient (R=0·43; figure 5C). A receiver operator curve
determined that plasma NfL levels could discriminate between healthy individuals and patients with
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (area under the curve of 0·956; figure 5D) and the distribution
of each was plotted (figure 5E). Based on the current data, 37 pg/mL can be considered a conservative
cut-off to distinguish between healthy patients and patients with hATTR amyloidosis, at which the false
positive rate is 3·6% and the true positive rate is 84·9%.

Discussion
Plasma proteomics and the identification of minimally invasive biomarkers are emerging as integral
parts of modern drug discovery and clinical development. In an effort to leverage this approach, the
plasma proteomes of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were investigated over time

in the largest clinical proteomic study of this disease to date. Proteomic analyses of patient plasma
samples demonstrated that patisiran treatment resulted in a general shift of patients’ proteomes
towards those of healthy individuals compared with patients who received placebo treatment. This
finding suggests that the plasma protein milieu is reflective of hATTR amyloidosis disease progression
and response to treatment. Across >1000 unique proteins that were assessed from plasma samples
collected in the APOLLO study, 66 proteins were found to exhibit a significantly different plasma level
time profile in patisiran- compared with placebo-treated patients over the course of 18 months. Of
these, NfL was identified as the protein most significantly different between the two groups. Collectively
these findings demonstrate that patient proteome changes are detectable following treatment, as well
as support the identification of proteins that have both the potential to serve as biomarkers and offer
insights into hATTR amyloidosis disease biology.
Of highest clinical interest are the high plasma NfL levels detected in patients with hATTR amyloidosis
with polyneuropathy, and the subsequent decrease of these following patisiran treatment. This is
important given the emerging role of NfL as a general biomarker of central and peripheral nervous
system dysfunction. NfL is an integral component of the axonal structure of neurons and has been
described extensively as a biomarker of neuroaxonal injury across many central nervous system diseases
including multiple sclerosis,18 Alzheimer’s,19 and Huntington’s,16 as well as peripheral nervous system
diseases such as vasculitis,20 chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP),21 Guillain–Barré
syndrome,22 and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT).23 Mutations in NfL itself can also lead to CMT
disease, a group of inherited peripheral neuropathies, indicating that NfL plays a crucial role in
peripheral nerve function.24 Elevated NfL levels in these diseases are thought to be caused by the
release of NfL into circulation from damaged neurons25 and it has been identified in both cerebrospinal
fluid26 and blood.27 In this study the mean NfL levels described in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with
polyneuropathy (69·4 pg/mL) were higher than those observed for other peripheral nerve disorders

(CIDP 42 pg/mL, CMT 26 pg/mL)21,23 and consistent with a previous report in patients with hATTR
amyloidosis (58·1 pg/mL).28
Patisiran treatment lowers TTR messenger RNA levels (and therefore circulating TTR protein), potentially
resulting in a reduction of amyloid burden, which is hypothesised to halt or reduce neuronal damage.15
This hypothesis was supported by the improvement of polyneuropathy seen in patients treated with
patisiran in the APOLLO study. The current study suggests that a patisiran-mediated reduction in nerve
damage also causes a reduction in plasma levels of NfL. Reductions in NfL levels observed following only
9 months of patisiran treatment indicate that treatment reduces hATTR amyloidosis-associated
neuronal damage within a short timeframe. While the reduction in NfL levels was sustained for a further
9 months of patisiran treatment, the lack of a further meaningful reduction between months 9 and 18
towards levels detected in healthy individuals is not in alignment with the clinical results from APOLLO,
in which there was an additional improvement in mNIS+7 between month 9 and 18. Further
investigation would be necessary to explain this discrepancy.
The correlation observed between change in mNIS+7 score and change in plasma NfL levels over 18
months indicates that decreasing levels of NfL detected in patients treated with patisiran are also
associated with improvement in polyneuropathy. There was, however, no correlation between NfL
levels and mNIS+7 score at baseline. One explanation for this observation is that significant
heterogeneity exists in inter-patient plasma NfL levels, while intra-patient NfL changes over time may be
more informative regarding changes in disease status.
Notably, levels of NfL were elevated at baseline in patients with and without evidence of cardiac
amyloid involvement, suggesting that NfL may be useful as a biomarker of polyneuropathy in patients
previously diagnosed with hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. An investigation of plasma NfL

levels in patients with predominantly cardiomyopathic phenotype may further support hATTR
amyloidosis as a single multisystem disease, regardless of TTR mutation or initial presenting symptoms.
In addition to monitoring disease progression and treatment response, NfL may serve as a potential
diagnostic biomarker or as an indicator for the transition from an asymptomatic carrier to a
symptomatic patient. Studies reported in the literature suggest NfL can serve as a prognostic biomarker
in pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis29 and Alzheimer’s disease.30 The data described here
suggest that a plasma NfL concentration of 37 pg/mL may represent a clinically meaningful threshold to
aid the diagnosis of neuronal damage in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, supplementing clinical
assessments that are already being used. Due to the heterogeneity observed in patients with hATTR
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, the amount of change in NfL levels over time may prove to be a more
sensitive indicator of neuronal damage than absolute levels. In plasma samples collected from the phase
3 APOLLO study, an average increase of 30 pg/mL was observed in the placebo group over the course of
18 months, indicating that NfL may also serve as a biomarker of disease progression.
In conclusion, this study represents the first system-wide proteomics interrogation of response to an
RNAi therapeutic in humans. The analysis of samples collected from APOLLO patients has led to an
improved understanding of polyneuropathy progression in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. NfL has
been identified as a protein that is differentially expressed in patients with hATTR amyloidosis vs healthy
individuals. Changes in plasma NfL levels are also seen in response to patisiran treatment over time,
highlighting the potential of this protein to serve as a biomarker in several capacities, including as an
early diagnostic biomarker of hATTR amyloidosis or a predictor of when disease may become manifest in
asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic TTR mutations, and as an objective marker for monitoring disease
progression and/or reversal over time. The results from this comprehensive, proteomic analysis using
samples from a placebo-controlled study have (1) identified NfL as a potential multi-purpose biomarker

Research in context

Evidence before this study
A PubMed search was carried out for articles published up to 25 October 2019 on circulating biomarkers
in transthyretin amyloidosis using the terms “( ([TTR] OR [transthyretin]) AND ([amyloidosis] OR
[polyneuropathy]) AND [biomarkers] AND ([blood] OR [serum] OR [plasma]) )”. Only two studies from
the same research group were identified from this search. These studies analysed the concentrations of
plasma proteins in healthy controls, patients with polyneuropathy, or patients with cardiomyopathy
caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis or wild-type transthyretin-mediated
amyloidosis, using multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Study cohorts were small, with only
8–10 individuals included in each study and a total of 160 different proteins measured. Additionally,
these studies did not examine changes in plasma levels of each protein over time, or in response to
treatment.
A PubMed search was also completed for articles published up to 25 October 2019 on NfL in ATTR
amyloidosis by use of the terms “( ([TTR] OR [transthyretin]) AND ([amyloidosis] OR [polyneuropathy])
AND ([neurofilament light chain] or [NfL] or [NEFL]) )”. Only one previous study was identified which
examined plasma NfL levels in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. This study found elevated levels of NfL
in 73 patients with hATTR amyloidosis; however, it did not analyse change in plasma NfL levels over time
or after initiation of a therapeutic and it did not investigate any other circulating proteins.

Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study is the largest proteomic study to date in patients with hATTR amyloidosis
with polyneuropathy, analysing plasma levels of >1000 proteins in samples from 246 individuals.
Furthermore, this is the first study to analyse changes in the plasma proteome occurring in response to
an RNAi therapeutic in humans. These findings provide additional evidence to suggest that NfL may be
an important biomarker for patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Additionally, they
provide new evidence that demonstrates the potential of NfL as a biomarker to monitor disease
progression/reversal and response to treatment in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with
polyneuropathy.

Implications of all the available evidence
Measurement of plasma NfL levels may serve as a non-invasive, complementary approach to facilitate
earlier diagnosis, and monitor disease progression and treatment response in patients with hATTR
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. However, further evidence will be important to confirm these
findings. Additional proteins were identified that may also serve as biomarkers in hATTR amyloidosis
with polyneuropathy, although their involvement in disease biology will require further investigation.

patients trending towards that of healthy controls at 18 months
(A) A subset of the measured proteins was used to project the differences between patients with hATTR
amyloidosis and healthy controls at baseline onto two principal components (PC1 and PC2) that most
explained the difference in the data sets; analysis of (B) placebo-treated patients at 18 months and (C)
patisiran-treated patients at 18 months is shown in the same PC1 and PC2 space. (D) Illustrative diagram
depicting v1 and v2 as well as ф and ϴ. For each patient, a vector (v1) from the mean healthy patient to
baseline and a second vector (v2) from baseline to month 18 were used to compute two metrics, one for
the ratio of the magnitude of v2 compared to v1 denoted as ф, and ϴ as the angle between the two
vectors. Here ф measures the rate of disease progression or reversal and ϴ measures the directionality
of the proteome (defined by whether the proteome moves away or towards the healthy controls). (E)
