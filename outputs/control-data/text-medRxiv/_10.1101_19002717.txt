Abstract
Aim
The primary aim of the study was to determine whether patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) have different personality profiles compared to patients with
epileptic seizures (ES). The secondary aim was to determine whether any such personality
differences could be used to efficiently screen for PNES in clinical settings.

Background
PNES and ES are often difficult to differentiate, leading to incorrect or delayed diagnosis.
While the current gold-standard investigation is video-EEG monitoring (VEM), it is resource
intensive and not universally available. Although some research has investigated the
differential psychological profiles of PNES and ES patients, most studies have focused on
symptoms of psychopathology. The lack of research using modern personality models in
PNES and ES presents a gap in knowledge that this study aimed to address.

Methods
A retrospective collection of data was conducted on patients who completed the NEO-Five
Factor Inventory questionnaire during a VEM admission to the Royal Melbourne Hospital
between 2002-2017. Patients were classified as either ES or PNES based on clinical
consensus diagnosis. For patients with ES, type of epilepsy and laterality of seizure focus
were also recorded. Personality differences were investigated using Bayesian linear mixed
effects models. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed to
generate sensitivities and specificities of individual personality scores.

Results
305 patients were included in the study. The ‘openness to experience’ domain was the only
personality factor demonstrating strong evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 21.55, d = 0.43 [95% CI -0.71, -0.17]), with patients in the PNES group having higher scores compared
to the ES group. Within the openness to experience domain, only the ‘aesthetic interest’ facet
showed evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 7.98, d = -0.39 [95% CI -0.66, -0.12]). ES
patients had lower scores on these measures compared to the normal population, while PNES
patients did not. Both openness to experience and aesthetic interest, however, showed poor
sensitivities (53%, 46% respectively) and specificities (69%, 46% respectively) for

classifying PNES and ES patients. There were no differences between personality profiles in
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and non-TLE patients, or in laterality in TLE.

Conclusion
Patients with ES exhibit lower openness to experience and aesthetic interest compared to
patients with PNES and compared to the general population. Despite these differences, the
relatively low sensitivity and specificity of these instruments suggests their use is limited in a
clinical setting. Nevertheless, these findings open up new avenues of research using modern
personality models to further understand patients with epilepsy and related presentations.

1. Introduction1
Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are episodes of abnormal limb movements that
resemble epileptic seizures (ES), but are not associated with organic aetiologies, and
presumably manifest due to psychological distress [1]. Similarities in presentation to ES
mean that patients with PNES are often misdiagnosed with epilepsy, resulting in multiple
financial, social, emotional and health implications [2–6]. The current gold standard
investigation in the differentiation between ES and PNES is video-EEG monitoring (VEM)
[7–10]. Despite VEM’s advantages, it is expensive, of limited availability and resource
intensive [11]. The cost of VEM approximates to USD $1,100- $1,700 per day due to the
need for a highly trained multidisciplinary team and specialised equipment [11,12]. This
presents a challenge for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Furthermore, the
occurrence of a PNES event is not guaranteed, with PNES being more likely to occur offcamera than ES [13]. Therefore, a pressing issue for PNES is to find a simpler, cheaper and
more readily available methods to screen for PNES.
Due to this recognizable problem, there is a need to better identify patients at risk of PNES
prior to being admitted for VEM [14]. A notable area of research has been the differential
psychological profiles of PNES and ES patients. Most research in this area has focused on
measures of psychopathology, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
(MMPI) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). While these measures assess some
aspects of personality, they focus on common symptoms of psychiatric disorders (such as
depression, or anxiety). For example, while the MMPI does include the assessment of some
personality characteristics, the psychopathological variables make it hard to determine
personality correlations between patients with ES and PNES. Furthermore, the PAI’s clinical
scales have been derived based on DSM criteria [15]. Relatively little research has used
modern models of non-pathological personality traits such as the five-factor model (FFM).
The FFM is a statistically-derived model that describes personality along five domains,
including neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and
conscientiousness [16].

Few notable studies using the five-factor model in the differentiation of PNES and ES has
been performed thus far. In the process of cluster analysing PNES using the Revised NEO
Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), Cragar et al. [17] compared the PNES patients to an
epilepsy control group and found that PNES patients scored higher on neuroticism and on the
agreeableness facet of modesty and lower on the extraversion facet of gregariousness and on
the agreeableness facet of trust compared to epilepsy controls. Although these findings are
relevant, the study sizes were small and personality differences between PNES and epilepsy
were not the focus of the study, but rather a secondary finding. More recently, Vilyte et al.
reported no differences in FFM traits between patients with PNES and ES in a small sample
of South African patients [18]. Lack of clinically focused, high-quality research in this area
shows the need for a more in-depth study using the modern personality models.
This large retrospective study aimed to utilise the FFM model of personality to determine
profile differences between patients with PNES and ES admitted to a specialist VEM unit in a
large tertiary centre. It also aimed to directly investigate the classification accuracy of these
differences in a clinical setting, which has often been overlooked in previous research.
Following Cragar et al., we hypothesised that PNES patients would score higher on
neuroticism, and lower on extraversion compared to patients with ES. We expected that such
differences would translate into efficient screening for PNES in this population.

2. Methods
2.1 Participants
This was a retrospective case control study. Data were collected from patients as part of
routine psychological care who were admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH),
Australia, VEM unit between the years 2002-2017. The RMH is a major epilepsy centre in
Australia and utilises the use of VEM and a multidisciplinary team involving epileptologists,
psychiatrists, EEG scientists, and neuropsychologists in diagnosing epilepsy. Inclusion
criteria for the current study included patients who had completed the NEO Five-Factor
Inventory (NEO-FFI) questionnaire during their VEM admission and those who had a 6th
grade reading level of English and above. Exclusion criteria included patients who were
under the age of 17 and patients with 10 or more responses missing. Of the 344 patients who
were initially recruited, 8 patients were underage and 31 had missing responses, leading to

305 patients being finally included in the study. This study received approval from the
Melbourne Health Ethics Committee (MH HREC# QA2012044).

2.2 Clinical diagnosis
Diagnosis of the patients admitted for VEM was determined at a large multidisciplinary
meeting consisting of EEG scientists, epileptologists, neuropsychologists, and psychiatrists.
Neuropsychiatric assessments, neurological examinations, and imaging was also heavily
considered in making the final diagnosis. A diagnosis of Epilepsy was made when a patient
met the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria of epilepsy [19,20], while a
diagnosis of PNES was made based on abnormal movements in the absence of EEG changes
[21]. Patients were classified into 4 main categories: ES, PNES, ES+PNES and nondiagnostic. Patients were categorised as non-diagnostic when a definite diagnosis could not
be made or if they had a condition which did not meet either ES or PNES criteria. Conditions
reported were migraines, postural hypotension, anxiety, cardiac syncope, arrhythmia, alcohol
excess, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)
and sick sinus syndrome. For patients with ES, the type of epilepsy was also classified
according to the ILAE classification of epilepsies [22]. Specifically, the focal epilepsies,
temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and extra-temporal lobe epilepsy (extra-TLE), and generalised
epilepsy. Laterality of seizure focus was also recorded for TLE patients. The NEO-FFI results
were not known to the VEM team and did not inform the diagnosis of PNES.

2.3 Personality assessment
The NEO-FFI is a 60-item self-administered measure of personality that describe an
individual’s degree of standing across five higher order factors: neuroticism, extraversion,
openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness [16]. These domains and their
definitions are included in Table A.1 in the supplementary material. The five factors were
identified via the factor analysis of all the trait adjectives found in English and other natural
languages [23] and has received widespread empirical support [16,24,25]. Construct validity
and internal consistency studies have shown the NEO-FFI to be a valid and reliable
psychometric tool for the assessment of personality [16]. Furthermore, the five-factor model
has shown to have good cross-cultural replicability [26] and real-life applicability by
demonstrating its ability to predict numerous important life outcomes [16]. The NEO-FFI

scores are calculated in the form of a normalised score, providing an indication as to where
an individual lies on a spectrum compared to the general population [16].

Facet scores were also computed for each of the 5 domains. While domain scores allow for a
global picture of an individual’s personality, facets allow for a deeper understanding of the
individual [16]. We computed scores for the 13 facets derived via an analysis performed by
Saucier [27]. Table A.2 illustrates the domains and its facets.

2.4 Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed JASP [28] and R [29]. Bayesian linear mixed effects models
were used to determine differences in personality profiles between the PNES and ES groups.
Separate analyses were conducted for TLE and non-TLE groups, as well as laterality in TLE
patients. For all analyses, the null model included gender and age as predictors of personality
and the alternative model contained these predictors plus the relevant personality domains
and diagnostic group (e.g. PNES vs ES). The statistical importance of each term was
determined using a model averaging approach. Specifically, the Bayes factor of inclusion
(BFinc) was computed for each term which represents the sum of the posterior model
probabilities for all models containing the term divided by the sum of posterior probabilities
for all models not containing the term. Higher interactions are excluded. A BFinc > 3 was
taken to indicate evidence for an effect, while BFinc < 1/3 was taken as evidence for the null
hypothesis. BFs between 1/3 and 3 were taken to indicate insensitivity to either hypothesis.
Follow-up Bayesian independent sample T-tests were computed to identify specific domain
differences between the groups, with BFs interpreted as described above. Effect sizes were
reported for all group comparisons in the form of Cohen’s [30] d, with 95% credible
intervals. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were computed to generate
sensitivities and specificities of individual domains and facets in order to determine
usefulness in a clinical setting.

3. Results
3.1 Sample characteristics
Full diagnosis and demographic variables are described in Table 1. Of the 305 patients who
met eligibility criteria, 122 (40%) were diagnosed with ES, 14 (5%) with both ES and PNES,

and 90 (30%) with PNES. The remaining 79 (25%) patients were classified as either ‘nondiagnostic’, or were diagnosed with an alternative, non-epileptic or non-psychogenic cause of
their presentation. Only the ES and PNES patients were included in the main statistical
analyses. Of the ES patients, 23 (17%) had extra-temporal focal epilepsy, 74 (54%) had TLE,
31 (23%) had generalised epilepsy, and 8 (6%) had probable focal epilepsy of unspecified or
unclear focus. Mean age was 38.79 (SD 15.33, range 17-92) and the majority of participants
were female (n= 202, 66%). There was no relationship between gender and VEM diagnosis
(BF10 = 0.02).
Psychiatric comorbidity was common with 113 (37%) patients having a history of any major
psychiatric disorder, and 12 (4%) patients having a history of borderline personality disorder.
PNES participants were more likely to have a history of depression (BF10 = 4.66), current
depression (BF10=5.91), or any current major psychiatric disorder (BF10 = 16.95). There was
no evidence for a relationship between diagnostic category and history of any major
psychiatric disorder (BF10 = 1.52), history of anxiety disorder (BF10 = 2.23), current anxiety
disorder (BF10 = 1.36), or history of borderline personality disorder (BF10 = 2.87).

3.2 Comparison of PNES and ES patients to population normative data
A Bayesian liner mixed effects model was computed to determine whether there were
differences between personality domains and facets in the combined PNES and ES cohort.
There was strong evidence for an effect of domain (BFinc > 100). As shown in Figure 1, the
highest scores were observed for neuroticism (M = 0.49, SD = 0.97), followed by openness
(M = -0.13, SD = 1.10), agreeableness (M = -0.22, SD = 1.20), extraversion (M = -0.23, SD =
1.03), and conscientiousness (M = -0.58, SD = 1.04). There was strong evidence that the
levels of neuroticism were higher when compared to normal population (BF10 ≥ 100). Levels
of extraversion (BF10 = 10.84) and consciousness (BF10 ≥100) were significantly lower than
the normal population.

3.3 Comparison of Epilepsy and PNES groups
A Bayesian linear mixed effects model was computed to determine differences in personality
domains between diagnostic groups (PNES and ES). While there was strong evidence for a
main effect of domain (BFinc >100), there was no evidence for a main effect of diagnostic
group (BFinc = 1.86). There was, however, evidence for diagnostic group by domain

interaction (BFinc = 9.92). This indicates that the two diagnostic groups had different
personality profiles. Follow-up Bayesian independent samples T-tests were performed to
investigate which specific domains differed between groups (see Table 2 and Figure 1).
Openness to experience was the only domain found with a strong evidence for a group
difference (BF10 = 21.55, d = -0.43 [95% CI -0.71, -0.17]). Patients in the PNES group
reported greater openness to experience compared to patients in the ES group. The null
hypothesis was supported for the agreeableness domain (BF10 = 0.21, d = 0.11 [95% CI -0.16,
0.38]), while the evidence was insensitive for the domains of neuroticism, extraversion and
conscientiousness.

A focused analysis was performed on the three facets that comprise the openness domain (see
Table 2). There was evidence for group differences on the aesthetic interest facet (BF10 =
7.98, d = -0.39 [95% CI -0.66, -0.12]), with PNES patients reporting higher scores compared
to ES patients. The evidence for the facets of intellectual interests and unconventionality was
insensitive. No evidence for a group difference was observed for the remaining facets, and
the null hypothesis was supported for the facets of sociability, activity, nonantagonistic
orientation, prosocial orientation, goal striving, and dependability.

To investigate these findings further, Bayesian single sample T test were performed to
compare each group to the general population in terms of levels of openness to experience.
Patients in the ES group reported lower openness to experience (BF10 = 94.07, d = -0.34 [95%
CI -0.52, -0.160]) and aesthetic interests (BF10 > 100, d = -0.58 [95% CI -0.77, -0.39]). In
contrast, patients in the PNES group had scores on openness to experience (BF10 = 0.23, d =
0.12 [95% CI -0.09, 0.32]) and aesthetic interests (BF10= 0.21, d = -0.11, [95% CI 0.32,0.09]) that were not different to the general population.

3.4 Comparison of all diagnostic groups
A Bayesian linear mixed effects model was also computed to determine differences in
personality domains between all four diagnostic groups (PNES, ES, ES+ PNES and nondiagnostic). While there was strong evidence for a main effect of domain (BFinc>100), the
null hypothesis was supported for the main effect of diagnostic group (BFinc < .01). The null
hypothesis was also supported for the domain by diagnostic group interaction (BFinc = 0.02).

Examination of the means for these groups confirmed that the addition of the ES+PNES and
non-diagnostic groups diluted the statistical effects.

3.5 Comparison of TLE and non-TLE
A Bayesian linear mixed effects model was computed to determine differences in personality
domains between the ES patients with TLE and the non-TLE ES patients. There was strong
evidence for a main effect of domain (BFinc > 100). The null hypothesis was supported for the
main effect of group (TLE vs non-TLE; BFinc = 0.11) and the group by domain interaction
(BFinc = 0.10).

3.6 Comparison of Left and Right TLE patients
Of the 70 TLE patients, 3 patients with bilateral TLE were excluded from the analysis,
leaving 37 Left TLE and 26 Right TLE patients. A Bayesian linear mixed effects model was
computed to determine differences in personality domains between left and right TLE
patients. The evidence was insensitive to the main effect of domain in this smaller subgrouping (BFinc = 2.36). The null hypothesis was support for the main effect of laterality
(BFinc = 0.17) and the laterality by domain interaction (BFinc = 0.05).

3.7 Diagnostic accuracy
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to determine whether
personality scores accurately classified PNES and ES patients. As shown in Table 3, the
openness to experience domain had an area under the curve (AUC) greater than .50, which
suggests that it performs better than chance at classifying diagnostic group. The sensitivity
(53%) and specificity (69%), however, were low. Similar results were seen for the aesthetic
interests facet in terms of sensitivity (46%) and specificity (74%). None of the other
personality domains produced high sensitivity or specificity metrics.

4. Discussion
In this study, we investigated differences in personality profiles between patients with PNES
and ES using the five-factor model of personality. Our primary finding was that patients with
PNES and ES differed in their personality profiles. Specifically, patients in the PNES group

exhibited higher scores on the openness to experience domain, which measures such
personality facets as propensity for fantasy, aesthetics interests, openness to feelings, and
acceptance of new ideas. Follow-up analyses showed that the strongest evidence was for the
aesthetic interests facet. Patients with ES had lower scores on these variables compared to the
general population, while PNES patients did not differ from normative data. While these
differences were large and supported by strong statistical evidence, the sensitivity and
specificity for the openness and aesthetic interests scores were poor, which suggests that their
use as psychometric screening instruments for PNES might be limited in a clinical setting.
We also found that, when combined, the PNES and ES groups had higher levels of
neuroticism, and lower levels of both extraversion and conscientiousness compared to the
general population. Further analysis of the data revealed no differences between personality
profiles in TLE and non-TLE patients, and no differences in personality profiles between
patients with left or right TLE.

Our finding of elevation in openness and aesthetic interests in PNES patients is not entirely
consistent with the previous literature. In a secondary analysis performed by Cragar et al.,
PNES patients scored higher in the domain of neuroticism compared to ES patients, while
differences in the domain of openness were also found to be insignificant [17]. This
discrepancy could be accounted for by several factors. One potential factor is the use of the
NEO PI-R that was used in Cragar’s study as opposed to the NEO-FFI. The NEO PI-R
assessment allows for personality to be described across 30 facet scales in addition to the 5
domains [16]. This may allow for more comprehensive coverage of personality, accounting
for differences in results. However, the NEO-FFI was used in our study due to time
constraints and has been proven to be both a reliable and adequate measurement of a global
assessment of personality - the main focus of our study [16]. Results for neuroticism,
conscientiousness and extraversion were also insensitive in our study. It is possible that our
statistical power may have been insufficient to determine the results for these specific
domains. However, if that it is true, the effect sizes are likely to be small and possibly of little
clinical significance. Nevertheless, the finding of an elevation of openness is novel and adds
to the body of research reinforcing the association between personality profiles and
diagnostic groups.

One possible explanation for the elevation of openness and aesthetic interests may be related
to the association of both openness and ES with cognition. Openness is one of the more

challenging of the five personality factors to describe, due to the wide variety of traits that it
seems to encompass [31]. There has been a great deal of contention in the literature regarding
naming this specific factor, with other contenders being intellect and culture [31]. McCrae
and Costa who coined the term openness described it as essentiality traits relating to the
exploration of the world from a cognitive point of view [31]. It is, therefore, the factor that
has the greatest correlation with cognitive ability amongst the five factors of
personality[31,32]. Particularly in cognitive domains such as working memory, latent
inhibition and implicit learning [31]. Epilepsy also has been known to have a strong
association with cognition, with chronic epileptic patients having higher degrees of cognitive
impairment [33]. There is evidence that patients who have poor seizure control, longer
seizure duration, and earlier onset of disease are more adversely affected cognitively [33].
Given that this is most representative of our VEM cohort, it is possible that observed lower
openness scores might be partly reflective of prevalent cognitive impairment in this group.
However, it is important to note that this finding is speculative and provides a clear direction
for future research.

The idea of a personality profile specific to TLE, the Geschwind syndrome, has had a long
history. According to Waxman and Geschwind these patients demonstrate placidity, flighty
attention span, hypersexuality, hypergraphia and hyperreligiousity [34–37]. This discovery
led to heightened interests surrounding TLE personality and the development of the BearFedio Inventory (BFI) [38]. In their study, Bear and Fedio discovered that all 18 BFI traits
were elevated when comparing TLE patients with healthy controls [38]. However, the lack of
specificity and largely interrelated scales rendered the BFI to be an inaccurate measure of
TLE personality [39]. Nevertheless, the BFI was successful in shifting the focus in epilepsy
research from psychopathology to changes in behaviour [40]. Using modern personality
models, we did not find any differences in personality between TLE and non- TLE patients.
This is consistent with other studies using the five-factor model [41–43], but inconsistent
with two studies using different models of personality. Specifically, investigations using a
German personality questionnaire measuring neuroticism, extraversion, organic psychosyndrome and addiction, have generated different results [44,45]. While one study showed
TLE patients to have greater neuroticism score, both studies showed TLE patients to have
elevated introversion scores [44,45]. Although the reasons for the discrepancy is not entirely
clear, cultural factors are one possibility. Despite these contradictory findings, the modern
assessment of personality between TLE and non-TLE groups using the five-factor model has

generally shown no major differences. Our findings are consistent with the emerging view
that systematic personality differences between TLE and non-TLE patients do not exist.

Differences in personality profiles between patients with left and right TLE has been a less
investigated area. Our study showed no differences in personality profiles and laterality
which is consistent with a previous study in the literature using the same five-factor model
[41]. In contrast, two other studies in the literature have shown to contradict these findings
[38,46]. These studies found that patients with left TLE were more dependent and less
composed, whereas patients with right TLE were found to have the tendency to
underestimate their own problems. However, these studies were not performed using the fivefactor model making them difficult to be used as studies for comparison. Further research
using modern personality theory, such as the five-factor model, is warranted.

The strengths of our study include the use of a large sample size, gold standard VEM
diagnosis, and the exclusion of non-diagnostic and mixed groups of patients. This method of
patient sampling produces a high level of certainty regarding classification and allows for
well-defined phenotypes, greatly increasing the accuracy of the data. Our study also has an
advantage over most in the area of statistical analysis. The use of Bayesian statistics allows
us to overcome the limitations of null hypothesis significance testing which has come under
considerable criticism [47]. The built-in power analysis enables us to gather evidence for the
null. For example, in our study, the domain agreeableness was revealed to support the null
hypothesis, indicating that there are no differences in agreeableness between ES and PNES
patients. To our knowledge, our study has also been the first to directly investigate the
classification accuracy of the five-factor model in a clinical setting. While conventional
statistical methods are used to identify group differences no matter how small, they do not
address the clinically important question whether they assist in diagnosis. This is important to
consider as often group differences and clinical classification are not aligned. Our study
demonstrated considerable group differences present in the domain of openness and facet of
aesthetic interests, however, they did not perform sufficiently well to facilitate clinical use of
the NEO-FFI for diagnostic purposes.

The main limitation of our study is the absence of other clinical information (for example, the
number of years since first seizure-like event, length and frequency of seizures, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)) in the collected patient data. Some of these variables have been used

in combination with other psychometric testing in the past to increase PNES classification
accuracy [15,48,49]. However, this study was a clinical audit and it was necessary to limit the
investigation to personality data and limited demographics. Further research should
investigate the incremental validity of using other commonly collected variables in
combination with the NEO-FFI. Our research study also has the same limitation as most other
ES and PNES studies. Sampling from a tertiary referral population often results in a patient
group with the most severe forms of the disease and may cause results to be heavily skewed.
However, this sampling strategy is difficult to modify given the trade-off between a more
representative population and a reduced accuracy of diagnosis.

The novel finding of elevated openness and aesthetic interests in PNES patients compared to
ES patients may provide a new avenue for management strategies in PNES patients.
Currently, management in PNES patients involves a mixture of antidepressants and
psychotherapy [50,51]. Evidence for these strategies is limited and remains a large gap in the
literature. Patients who tend to score higher on the domain of openness have been shown to
be more receptive to unconventional forms of therapy such as imagery techniques [16].
Whilst no studies have investigated the relation between the facet of aesthetic interests and
therapy, people who score higher on this facet have a greater appreciation for art and may be
more suited to creative therapeutic modalities, such as art and music therapy. To our
knowledge, there is no research studying the benefits of art and music therapy in PNES
patients, however this presents a direction for future research. In addition, the lower
extraversion in ES and PNES patients compared to the general population indicate that they
may require more directed forms of therapy and antidepressant medication compared to
patients who have high extraversion scores [16].

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, our study has been the first to investigate the use of modern models of
personality to classify PNES and ES. While openness and aesthetic interests were
demonstrated to be elevated in PNES patients, sensitivity and specificity were poor for
diagnostic or screening purposes. Although the differences in response profiles were not
sufficient for clinical classification, our study demonstrates that there is evidence for an
association between personality profiles and these diagnostic groups. Repeating this study

using more recent psychometric tests such as the NEO-Personality Inventory 3 or the
Personality Inventory for DSM-5 is an avenue for new research.

Figure 1. Distribution of personality scores in the combined PNES and ES cohort. The dotted
line shows the mean for the general population. As shown in A, participants had higher
scores on neuroticism, and lower scores in extraversion and conscientiousness compared to
the general population. As shown in B, the two groups had comparable scores for all domains
except openness to experience, on which the PNES group had high scores compared to the
ES group. Scores for the ES group were below the mean for the general population.
