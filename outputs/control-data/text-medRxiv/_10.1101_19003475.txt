Background
Competency frameworks serve various roles including outlining characteristics of a competent
workforce, facilitating mobility, and analysing or assessing expertise. Given these roles and their
relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in
the development of existing competency frameworks.
Methods
We applied the Arksey and O’Malley framework to undertake this scoping review. We searched
six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and
three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) using keywords related to
competency frameworks. We screened studies for inclusion by title and abstract, and we
included studies of any type that described the development of a competency framework in a
healthcare profession. Two reviewers independently extracted data including study
characteristics. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative.
Results
Among 5,710 citations, we selected 190 for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in
medicine and nursing professions. Literature reviews and group techniques were conducted in
116 studies each (61%), and 85 (45%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We
observed a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to
existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we
observed in timeframes, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and
strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework
development.
Conclusions
We observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency
framework development process. While some variation can be expected given the differences
across and within professions, our results suggest there is some difficulty in determining whether
methods were fit-for-purpose, and therefore in making determinations regarding the
appropriateness of the development process. This uncertainty may unwillingly create and
legitimise uncertain or artificial outcomes. There is a need for improved guidance in the process
for developing and reporting competency frameworks.

Introduction
As individual health professions evolve, identification of competencies describing required
knowledge, skills, attitudes and other characteristics (KSAOs) for effective professional practice
are needed by professionals, educators, and regulators (Campion et al. 2011; Gonczi et al. 1990;
Palermo et al. 2017). Identifying these competencies ensures that healthcare professions are well
defined, promotes competent workforces, facilitates assessment, facilitates professional mobility,
and helps to analyze and evaluate the expertise of the profession and the professional (Baer
1986; Campion et al. 2011; Eraut 1994; Gonczi et al. 1990; Heywood et al. 1992; ten Cate 2005;
Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999; Winter and Maisch 2005; World Health Organization 2005). The
CanMEDS framework, the ACGME Outcomes project, and the entry-level registered nurse
practice competencies are examples of frameworks that have been used in these ways (Black et
al. 2008; J. Frank et al. 2015; Swing 2007). Given the stakes that such frameworks hold for
educators, learners, regulators, health professions and healthcare broadly, development
guidelines have been created (See Table 1).

Binary vs continuum – is the framework going to be used to make a
competent versus not-competent argument? Or is it to be used in a
developmental manner (learning) manner?
2. Atomistic vs holistic – atomistic, checklist type competency frameworks
can result in reductionist approaches to complex tasks. Holistic frameworks
can face challenges when attempts are made to operationalize them due to
lack of detail.
3. Context-specific vs Context-general – the intended generalisability and
adaptability of a framework beyond particular contextual boundaries should
help to determine the degree of contextual specificity incorporated into the
development process.
What HR application should we include in the initial model building project?
What will the key users of the model need from it?
How should key stakeholders be involved?
How extensive should the data collection be?
How should we balance research with intuitive approaches?
What format of behavioural descriptors will best suit the application?
How do we plan to accommodate additional, future competency models?
Consider organizational context competency
Link competency models to organizational goals and objectives
Start at the top
Use rigorous job analysis methods to develop competencies
Consider future-oriented job requirements
Use additional unique methods
Define the anatomy of a competency
Define levels of proficiency on competencies
Use organizational language
Include both fundamental (cross-job) and technical (job-specific) competencies
Use competency libraries
Achieve the proper level of granularity (number of competencies and amount of
detail)
Use diagrams, pictures, and heuristics to communicate competency models to
employees
Use organizational development techniques to ensure competency modeling
acceptance and use
Maintain the currency of competencies over time

The development of competency frameworks requires strategies to capture and represent the
complexity associated with healthcare practice. This complexity can emerge in a number of
ways. For example, regional or contextual variability, unique practice patterns, the role and
attributes of individuals and individuals within teams, and other interacting competencies make
practice in multiple contexts possible (Bordage and Harris 2011; Garavan and McGuire 2001;

Heywood et al. 1992; Hodges and Lingard 2012; Knapp and Knapp 1995; Lingard 2012;
Makulova et al. 2015; Roe 2002). The nature of clinical practice can also be difficult to define or
understand fully (Garavan and McGuire 2001; Mendoza 1994). The role of tacit knowledge in
professional practice for example, can be difficult to represent - that is, there can be a disconnect
between the personal knowledge of professionals which becomes embedded in their practice, and
the publicly accessible knowledge base of the profession (Collin 1989; Eraut 1994). Competence
and its component parts are often inconsistently understood or defined and attributed multiple
meanings depending on context (Hay-McBer 1996; Spencer and Spencer 1993; ten Cate and
Scheele 2007). Other difficulties may include shifts in patient demographics or societal
expectations, the role of technology, and changes in organizational structures (Duong et al. 2017;
Jacox 1997; Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999). As such, any attempt to represent professional
practice must contend with these challenges, which leaves developers with decisions on how best
to make those choices (Garavan and McGuire 2001; Shilton et al. 2001).
Given this inherent complexity in capturing and accurately representing the features of a health
profession, a variety of approaches may be employed. Influencing issues such as practicality,
efficiency, and what might be deemed acceptable to the profession may have a role (see Table 1).
While there is no guidance on what specific methods to use, when to use them, or how to use
them, there is consensus that in order to increase the validity and utility of competency
frameworks a combination of approaches may be necessary, akin to a process of triangulation
(Heywood et al. 1992; Klink and Boon 2002; Kwan et al. 2016; Marrelli et al. 2005). However,
feasibility, the complexity of practice, and access to appropriate stakeholders may prompt
developers to prioritise aspects of the developmental and validation process (Marrelli et al. 2005;
Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999).
These challenges may result in variable or uncertain outcomes that may be of limited validity
and utility (Lester 2014; Shilton et al. 2001). This in turn may inaccurately represent the
profession, or represent it in unintended ways, and inappropriately impact downstream
dependent systems such as policy/standards development, accreditation and curriculum. Given
the activity related to the development of competency frameworks in many health professions,
little attention has been paid to the development process. Despite existing guidelines, the
complexity associated with different professional practices may lead some to enact development
activities differently. This emphasis on actual developmental processes, in the context of existing
but perhaps incomplete or inadequate guidelines, is the focus of our study. Understanding these
activities may provide insights into how these processes shape eventual outcomes and their
validity and/or utility, and provide insights into what may hold value for the refinement of
existing guidelines. As such, the primary objective of our study is to understand the way in
which health professions develop competency frameworks and then to consider these activities
against existing guidance.
Methods
Design
We conducted a scoping review, which enabled us to identify, map and present an overview of a
heterogeneous body of literature (Arksey and O’Malley 2005; Munn et al. 2018). We deemed a
scoping review to be appropriate given our interest in identifying key characteristics of

competency framework development as well as potential knowledge or practice gaps (Munn et
al. 2018). We employed Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) five-stage framework which included (1)
identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) refining the study selection
criteria, (4) collecting relevant data from each article, and (5) collating, summarizing, reporting,
and interpreting the results. We reported our process according to the PRISMA Extension for
Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al. 2018).
Research questions
1. How are competency frameworks developed in healthcare professions?
2. How do competency framework development processes align with previous guidance?
3. What insights can be gleaned from the activities of health professions in their
developmental activities and their alignment or not with previous guidance?
Identify relevant studies
Systematic search
We structured searches using terms that addressed the development of competency frameworks
in healthcare professions. In addition, we considered other related concepts, and combinations of
keywords and subject headings that were used are outlined in Appendix I. We selected six
databases to ensure a broad range of disciplines were included: MEDLINE, CINAHL,
PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). We also
searched grey literature sites greylit.org and Trove, and we reviewed the first 1,000 records from
Google Scholar. We title screened citations within articles if they appeared relevant to the review
(Greenhalgh and Peacock 2005). Our search was restricted to articles published in English. No
limits were set on publication date, study design or country of origin. We conducted pilot
searches in May and June 2018 with the help of two information specialists to refine and finalize
the search strategy, and we conducted the final searches in August 2018.
Citations were imported into EndNote X8 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA) and we
manually removed duplicate citations. The remaining articles were uploaded to the online
systematic-review software Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) for
title and abstract screening, and data characterisation.
Select the studies
Eligibility criteria
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they involved a healthcare profession, produced a
competency framework, and explicitly described the development process. Where the same data
were reported in more than one publication (e.g., a journal article and a thesis), we only included
the version that reported the most complete data. Studies of all types were included.
Title and abstract screening
Initial screening comprised of a review of title and abstracts by two reviewers (AB and BW).
Disagreements were resolved through discussion until consensus was achieved. Where
disagreement remained or there was insufficient evidence to make a decision, the citation was
included for full article review.

Critical appraisal
In line with the scoping review framework, we did not conduct a critical appraisal (Arksey and
O’Malley 2005).
Chart the data
To support the full-text review, we developed a standardised data extraction form to organize
information, confirm relevance, and to extract study characteristics (See Appendix II) (Ritchie
and Spencer 2002). The information we collected included study characteristics, objectives of
studies, and citations. Relevance was confirmed by sampling population and objectives.
Characteristics collected via this form included: Author (year), country; Sampling population;
Objective/Aim; Methods used; Count of methods; Outcomes. Additional coding was performed
in September 2019 based on peer-review, and included: Rationale; Rationale for methods;
Triangulation; Funding. We compiled all data into a single spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel 2013
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for coding and analysis.
Data summary
Due to variations in terminology, methods and strategies used it was necessary to merge some of
these in order to facilitate synthesis. This was an iterative process whereby we reduced variation
to produce a discrete list of codes, while retaining the pertinent information in each study. For
example, we considered ‘steering groups’, ‘working groups’, ‘committees’, and ‘expert panels’
sufficiently similar to be coded as a form of 'group technique’, while we coded Delphi process
and nominal group technique (NGT) as forms of ‘consensus methods’. Stakeholder deliberation
included conferences or workshops (but these may also have been used for other purposes), and
alternative strategies including input from professional associations. Codes and their definitions
are outlined in Table 2.
Table 2. Codes and definitions
Code

Definition/description of approach

Example from included studies

1. Group techniques

Various methods of group processes
were used to draft initial frameworks,
edit drafts created by expert panels, or
provide expert review and input into
framework development. These
included steering/working groups,
expert groups, and conferences or
workshops.

“An Expert Working Group, comprising
an SBN [specialist breast nurse] and
researchers and academics in the field of
breast cancer nursing, was convened to
synthesise the data that emerged from
stakeholder consultation with the
published literature.” (Yates et al. 2007)

1.1 Conference or
workshop

A method whereby events are hosted to
bring together small and large groups,
of the same or multiple disciplines, in
order to gain input, and depending on
the format of the event, consensus and
feedback to refine and revise the
competency framework

“A one-day conference was held with
two leaders from each of 31 medical
schools” (Z. Liu et al. 2016)

Revision date: 23/10/2019
2. Literature review

A method that seeks to identify current
knowledge of a topic, allow for
consolidation, and facilitate researchers
to build on previous work, to avoid
duplication and to identify any
omissions or gaps in the knowledge of a
topic (Grant and Booth 2009). A review
of related research literature was
conducted prior to or during the
development of the competency
framework. These included systematic,
scoping, integrative and focused
reviews, and other variations such as
environmental scans.

“A literature search was carried out in
order to identify existing competency
frameworks for dementia care” (Smythe
et al. 2014)

3. Stakeholder
deliberation

A strategy whereby stakeholders
(practitioners, external organisations,
experts in the field or other relevant
parties) were solicited for feedback

“The professional association,
occupational health nurses who were not
members of ACORN, and other
stakeholders in the workplace were
invited to provide feedback.” (Davey
1995)

3.1 Stakeholder
deliberation
(patient/carer)

A strategy whereby patients and/or their
carers were directly engaged in the
framework development process as a
stakeholder

“A meeting convened in 2010 involved
stakeholders in UK nursing education,
practice and management, including
patient representatives” (Kirk et al. 2014)

4. Mapping exercise

The competency framework was
mapped against existing national or
international standards for the
profession, or for the health service of
the country or region to ensure
alignment with existing standards and
policies.

“Using the results of the literature review
and environmental scan, the Working
Group adapted the Irish Palliative Care
Competence Framework” (McCallum et
al. 2018)

5. Consensus
methods

Methods that involved the input of
individuals in order to gain consensus or
agreement on items, framework
construct or validate a draft framework.
Methods included Delphi process, NGT,
and group priority sort.

5.1 Delphi process

A facilitated group consensus method
conducted over several iterations, in
order to elicit opinion and response
from a panel of experts, with an
emphasis on informed judgement
(Brown 1968) in order to inform
framework development.

-8-

“We convened an inter-professional
panel of experts to validate our
competency framework by way of a
modified Delphi technique” (Moaveni et
al. 2010)

Revision date: 23/10/2019
5.2 Nominal group
technique

A method involving a highly structured
meeting during which a group of
diverse, but representative participants
individually respond to questions,
present their responses one at a time,
and subsequently prioritize responses in
an anonymous fashion (Delbecq and
Van de Ven 1971) in order to inform
framework development

“We employed three methods in this
study: (1) nominal group technique
(NGT), (2) expert committee, and (3)
text analysis” (Ho et al. 2011)

5.3 Group priority sort

A method whereby a group of diverse
stakeholders identify priorities, define a
complex concept and contribute to
informed decision making in topics
where evidence is lacking or
inappropriate (Jacobson et al. 2013)

“The group priority sort method, which
involves engaging groups of stakeholders
in sorting and ranking activities, was
used as a validation method” (Ling et al.
2017)

6. Survey

A method whereby an online or offline
questionnaire was sent to stakeholders
(practitioners, external organisations,
experts in the field or other relevant
parties)

“…validate the resulting framework by
conducting a complex survey of two
cohorts of Fellows” (J. R. Frank 2005)

7. Focus groups

A method that involves in-depth group
interviews on a particular topic in which
participants are selected because they
are a purposive sampling of a specific
population (Lederman 1990, p117).
Competency frameworks were
discussed in focus groups with
stakeholders or practitioners.

“Preliminary input was obtained through
a series of focus groups” (Myers et al.
2015)

8. Interviews

A method whereby competency
frameworks were discussed in
interviews (structured, semi-structured ,
in-depth, group* etc.) with stakeholders
or practitioners

“A purposive sample of 25 nurse leaders
provided information during structured
interviews” (Amendola 2008)

9. Practice analysis

A strategy whereby authors sought to
directly or indirectly observe the
conduct of practice in the context of the
practice environment, operationalized
through several different methods

“Over 800 hours of specialist critical
care nursing practice were observed and
grouped into `domains' or major themes
of specialist practice” (Dunn et al. 2000)

Data synthesis
We further explored the outlined codes in order to provide insight into their purpose and how
they were operationalized. After synthesizing the results, we then organized them by frequency
of use from most to least common. We outlined variations that existed within each code
including form, function, application, and intended outcomes. This qualitative approach to
analysis was performed inductively and iteratively, allowing the data to be representative of
itself. The synthesis and subsequent discussion are influenced by our perspective that context is

important both in the original studies, and in our own interpretation of the literature.
Additionally, study authors may have held underlying positions that are distinct from ours, which
may result in differing interpretations of their studies.
Results
Search results and study selection
The search yielded 5,669 citations. We identified an additional 110 citations through searches of
grey literature, and hand searching. After elimination of duplicates, we screened 5,710 citations
at the title and abstract level. This led to the exclusion of 5,331 citations. After full-text review of
379 citations, we included 190 full-texts for data extraction and analysis. See Figure 1 for an
illustration of these findings using PRISMA Diagram, and Appendix III for a full list of included
studies.

Characteristics of included studies
Included studies were published between 1978 and 2018. The majority were published as peerreviewed articles (n=172), with the remaining literature comprised of reports (n=13) and theses
(n=5). The majority of studies were from the USA (n=65, 34%), followed by the United
Kingdom, Canada, and Australia (n=27 each, 14% each). Nursing and medicine competency
frameworks accounted for the majority (n=65, 34% each), followed by multidisciplinary
frameworks (n=36, 19%). See Table 3 for further characteristics of included studies.

Figure 2. Frequency of reported methods and strategies

Studies varied in the number of approaches used from one (n=20, 11%) to seven (n=3, 2%) (See
Table 5). The median number used was three, and a total of 132 studies (69%) utilised three or
more methods or strategies. Combinations of methods varied, and no distinct pattern of use
emerged when analysed by profession, location or year. Triangulation of methods was mentioned
in 18 (9%) studies. Study periods were not outlined in the majority of studies, but of those that
did (n=81, 43%), the timeframe for development ranged from two days to six years, with 41 of
these (51%) completed in 12 months or less.

All included studies provided a rationale for the development of the framework. Improvement in
education was the most commonly reported rationale (medicine), followed by care improvement
(nursing) (see Table 6 and Appendix V for more detail). A total of 79 studies (42%) provided a
clearly outlined rationale for their choice of methods, and a further 27 (14%) provided a partial
rationale. While a detailed analysis of evaluation was outside of the scope of our review,
evaluation of the final framework was reported in seven studies (4%), while a further 66 (35%)
recommended or planned evaluation. Funding sources were outlined for 110 studies (58%).

Variation in application of approaches
While diversity existed in the methods and strategies used in the development of competency
frameworks, we also observed variability within these approaches in form, function, application
and intended outcomes (e.g., to achieve consensus, to facilitate dissemination, to review drafts
etc.). The variation evident within these approaches suggests that authors made choices (that
were not always explicit) in what they valued as meaningful when using such techniques. As
such, the functional alignment of these choices remains unclear, and poses a challenge when we
attempt to infer alignment with framework objectives. Next we elaborate on these findings, with
the exception of DACUM due to its low popularity. Examples are referenced to illustrate
variance, but are not intended to be exhaustive lists. See Appendix III for full details.

Group techniques
Group techniques included working/steering, or expert groups (Aylward et al. 2014; D. Davis et
al. 2005), and various group data collection strategies (e.g., conferences and workshops) (Klick
et al. 2014; Skirton et al. 2010). Aylward et al. (2014) used a group technique to draft the initial
framework, while Davis et al. (2005) used it to edit a draft created by an expert group. Authors
including Klick et al. (2014) used a large conference to facilitate input and dissemination.
Conversely, others such as Skirton et al. (2010) elected for a smaller group workshop to review
drafts and gain input. While there is variation within this category, the same holds true for other
sources of evidence for competency framework development.
Literature reviews
Different types of literature reviews included (a) systematic reviews (Galbraith et al. 2017; Klick
et al. 2014), (b) scoping reviews (AlShammari et al. 2018; Redwood-Campbell et al. 2011), (c)
integrative reviews (Camelo 2012), (d) focused reviews (Tavares et al. 2016; Yates et al. 2007),
and (e) environmental scans (McCallum et al. 2018; National Physiotherapy Advisory Group
2017). Many authors did not explicitly outline the type of review they conducted, and instead
described it using generic terms such as ‘broad’, ‘extensive’, and ‘comprehensive’. Some authors
performed a review to identify existing competencies (Chen et al. 2013; Hemalatha and
Shakuntala 2018), while others performed it to inform subsequent methodology (Davey 1995;
Sherbino et al. 2014). It appears that authors make decisions regarding the type, role and
relevance of reviews, and integrate them (or not) for a variety of reasons which are often unclear
and remain implicit.
Stakeholder deliberation
We also noted variations in the role and relevance of stakeholder deliberation strategies, which
included involving (a) healthcare professionals (J. R. Frank 2005; Yates et al. 2007), (b)
professional associations (Davey 1995; Gillan et al. 2013), (c) academics (du Toit et al. 2010;
Tangayi et al. 2011), (d) charities and non-profit organisations (Tsaroucha et al. 2013), (e)
regulatory bodies (du Toit et al. 2010), (f) trade unions and employers (Reetoo et al. 2005), and
(g) patients and their families (R. Davis et al. 2008; Dewing and Traynor 2005). Authors elected
to use focus groups (Hamburger et al. 2015), interviews (Tsaroucha et al. 2013), surveys
(Tangayi et al. 2011), action research (Dewing and Traynor 2005), conferences and workshops
(D. Davis et al. 2005), online wikis (Ambuel et al. 2011), and/or patient advocacy organisations
(Yates et al. 2007). Stakeholder input served different purposes, and was used to draft the initial
framework (Kirk et al. 2014; Macmillan Cancer Support 2017), to refine and revise draft
frameworks (Aylward et al. 2014; Davey 1995), and to gain consensus for the adoption of
frameworks (Brewer and Jones 2013; Santy et al. 2005). Despite the focus on ‘patient-centred’
care described in many frameworks, only 21 studies (11%) reported engaging patients or their
caregivers. In other instances, it was difficult to understand the role of stakeholders. Who to
engage as stakeholders, how to engage them, and for what purpose is, similar to other
approaches, also idiosyncratic and thus difficult to infer alignment with framework goals.
Mapping exercises
The documents used for mapping exercises included (a) specialty board certification exams or
reporting milestones (Cicutto et al. 2017; Klein et al. 2014), (b) national policies and health
service agendas (Glanville Geake and Ryder 2009; Mills and Pritchard 2004), (c) relevant

frameworks from other countries (L. Liu et al. 2014; McCallum et al. 2018), and (d) international
or regional frameworks (Barry 2011; Wölfel et al. 2016). These mapping exercises were used as
a foundation for framework development (Boyce et al. 2011; McCallum et al. 2018), to identify a
pool of items to use in consensus methods (M. Liu et al. 2007), to generate behavioural items for
identified competencies (Aylward et al. 2014) and to organise and tabulate responses from
stakeholders (Loke and Fung 2014). There appears to be inconsistent adherence with previous
development guidance within this approach in relation to the importance of regional context.
Consensus methods
Consensus methods included (a) Delphi method (Cappiello et al. 2016; Sousa and Alves 2015),
(b) group priority sort (Ling et al. 2017) and, (c) nominal group technique (Kirk et al. 2014;
Landzaat et al. 2017). Cappiello et al. (2016) used a Delphi method to gain agreement on
competencies early in the development of the framework, while Sousa and Alves (2015) used it
as a final step to gain consensus. Kirk et al. (2014) utilised NGT as traditionally described
(Delbecq and Van de Ven 1971), while Landzaat et al. (2017) utilised a hybrid of modified
Delphi and NGT components. Ling et al. (2017) was the only study to utilise group priority sort
method. While consensus is a worthwhile strategy that aligns with previous guidance, the
rationale for a given approach over another, the sequence, or application was often unclear, and
this poses a challenge when we attempt to examine alignment.
Surveys
Surveys also varied by method, purpose, and characteristics of survey population. From a
methodological perspective, some were conducted online or via e-mail (Barnes et al. 2010; Klick
et al. 2014), via post (Bluestein 1993; R. Davis et al. 2008), or using a combination of
approaches (Baldwin et al. 2007). In terms of function, surveys were utilised to identify initial
competencies (Parkinson’s UK 2016), to elicit feedback during the development process
(Smythe et al. 2014), and in the subsequent validation of the framework (Sherbino et al. 2014).
Sample sizes varied from 33 (Ketterer et al. 2017) to 18,000 (National Physiotherapy Advisory
Group 2017), while response rates varied from 3% (NPAG 2017) to 89% (Z. Liu et al. 2016).
Actual number of responses ranged from 20 (Ketterer et al. 2017) to 6,247 (Z. Liu et al. 2016).
As evidenced within other methods employed, here too we observed variation in the application
and function of surveys.
Focus groups
Focus groups varied in composition, the size and number of groups, and purpose. For example,
the composition for some comprised of members of the same discipline (Halcomb et al. 2017;
Palermo et al. 2016), while others saw value in using members from different disciplines (Booth
and Courtnell 2012; Gillan et al. 2013) - in direct contrast to the sine qua non of focus groups
(Lederman 1990). In terms of how this method was used, some used it in the initial identification
and drafting of competencies (Booth and Courtnell 2012; Patterson et al. 2000), while others
used it to engage stakeholders during the development process (Banfield and Lackie 2009;
Smythe et al. 2014). Authors including Myers et al. (2015) used focus groups to validate draft
frameworks. The reasons for choices made by developers, and the methodological variation
evident in this approach remain unclear and inconsistently reported.

Interviews
The forms of interviews included (a) semi-structured (Akbar et al. 2005; Daouk-Öyry et al.
2017), (b) structured (Amendola 2008), (c) in-depth (Blanchette 2015; Tavares et al. 2016), (d)
group interviews (not focus groups) (Loke and Fung 2014), (e) critical incident (Lewis et al.
2010; McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2009), and (f) behavioural event interviews (Calhoun et al.
2008; Chen et al. 2013). Participants in interviews included patients and family members
(Dijkman et al. 2017; Patterson et al. 2000), academics (Chen et al. 2013; Gardner et al. 2006),
and healthcare professionals (Calhoun et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2013). Interviews were conducted
to gain expert input (Smythe et al. 2014; Tavares et al. 2016), to gain insight into practice (Dunn
et al. 2000; McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2009), to confirm findings from other methods (i.e.
triangulation) (Dunn et al. 2000; Palermo et al. 2017), and to solicit contributions from diverse
stakeholders (Kwan et al. 2016). The number of interviews conducted was often not reported,
however, several authors provided details on population, technique, and analysis for interviews
in their studies (Palermo et al. 2017; Tavares et al. 2016). As with other approaches, who to
interview, how, and for what purpose was often not adequately reported, and this presents a
challenge when we attempt to evaluate the outcomes.
Practice analysis
Practice analysis involved methods such as (a) functional analysis (Bench et al. 2003; Palermo et
al. 2016), (b) analysis of administrative data (Dressler et al. 2006; Stucky et al. 2010), (c) direct
observation of practice (Dewing and Traynor 2005; Underwood et al. 1996), (d) critical incident
technique (CIT) (Dunn et al. 2000; Lewis et al. 2010), (e) review of position descriptions (Akbar
et al. 2005; Fidler 1997), and (f) task or role analysis (Cattini 1999; Chang et al. 2013). Dressler
et al. (2006) identified commonly encountered conditions in billing data, while Stucky et al.
(2010) and Shaughnessy et al. (2013) identified commonly recorded diagnostic codes to inform
the development of competency frameworks. Dunn et al. (2000), Underwood et al. (1996), and
Dewing and Traynor (2005) observed practice in-person, while Patterson et al. (2000) observed
video recorded interactions to develop an understanding of practice. Practice analyses were used
to inform the initial list of competencies (Dressler et al. 2006; Fidler 1997), as a means of
capturing the complexity of practice in context (Dunn et al. 2000; Underwood et al. 1996), to
triangulate data from other methods (Lewis et al. 2010; McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2009), and as a
means of validating frameworks (Carrington et al. 2011). Timeframes of data collection also
varied significantly, and were not always reported. The variation with this approach was perhaps
to be expected given the differences in practice between professions. Despite existing guidance
related to the importance of job/practice analysis (Lucia and Lepsinger 1999; Roe 2002), this
method was rarely utilised, which obligates us to question why given its ability to explore the
complexities of practice.
Discussion
Competency frameworks serve various roles including outlining characteristics of a competent
workforce, facilitating mobility, and analysing or assessing expertise. Given how existing
development guidelines may be limited, combined with the known complexities of practice and
practical challenges faced by framework developers, we sought to understand the choices made
when developing competency frameworks. After we examined frameworks across multiple
contexts, we suggest that: variability exists in what methods or combinations of methods
developers use as well as within methods; there is inconsistent adherence to existing guidance

(e.g., most neglect practice analyses, but include multiple methods); limited connections are
made between intended use and methodological choices; and, outcomes are inconsistently
reported.
Given how competency frameworks are developed, we identified a lack of guidance on how to
identify the most appropriate methods. While existing guidance permits and/or encourages a
certain flexibility (Table 1), we did not identify any guidance regarding making those choices or
examining their suitability for the intended purpose or claims authors intend to make about their
outcomes (i.e., competency framework). In other words, existing guidance acknowledges that
what we consider fit for one setting or profession and intended use may not be for another, hence
the flexibility and variability (Whiddett and Hollyforde 1999). While this seems necessary,
existing guidelines also seem to lack organizing conceptual frameworks. As an example, social
sciences and humanities research often include conceptual or theoretical frameworks as means to
impose, organize, prioritize or align methodological choices. These validity ideals appear
challenged by practicalities when developing frameworks. That is, we assume by the
heterogeneity in our findings that methodological choices may have been influenced by
practicalities such as available resources, timeframes, and the experience and expertise of
developers. Other factors may include the maturity of the profession, the perspectives and
mandate of the developer (i.e. who is creating the framework), the consistency of roles within the
profession, and the complexity of practice which is enacted within broader social contexts. These
influencing factors remained largely implicit. Lacking sufficient guidance on these conceptual
and practical issues, the utility and validity associated with the framework becomes less clear, or
difficult to examine.
Limitations in guidelines related to methodological choices ultimately leave producers and users
struggling to make interpretations regarding suitability, utility and validity of competency
frameworks. In developing competency frameworks limited in conceptual, theoretical or “use”
alignment, we risk the perpetuation of frameworks that adopt a form of unintended or
unwarranted legitimacy. This may subsequently result in the creation of what we could term a
‘false-god’ framework, which refers to an object of afforded high value that is illegitimate or
inaccurate in its professed authority or capability (Toussaint 2009). That is, despite these
limitations when developing competency frameworks, the outcomes are ‘worshipped’, or treated
as legitimate or accurate representations of practice without sufficient conceptual or empirical
arguments, derived by the methods used, or in alignment with intended purpose. It has been
argued for example that social contexts and the complexities of clinical practice remain largely
ignored in current competency frameworks (Bradley et al. 2015). Outcomes (i.e. final products)
could perhaps (unknowingly) be prioritised over accurate representations of practice, thus
limiting their suitability and utility, and threatening validity arguments. Existing guidance
cautions that the more important the intended use of the framework, the more that its validity
needs to be assured (Heywood et al. 1992; Knapp and Knapp 1995). If validity is compromised,
this ‘false-god’ could exert substantial downstream effects including poor definitions of
competence as well as threats to curriculum and assessment frameworks. These implications
warrant consideration of improved guidance related to development and evaluation processes.
As a way forward, we may need to revisit and refine guidance surrounding competency
framework development to include ways of capturing and/or representing the complexity of

practice, borrowing from philosophical guidance included in mixed methods research in order to
improve suitability, utility and validity, while also establishing reporting and evaluation
principles (see Figure 3 for conceptual framework). First, we may need to include leverage if not
obligate affordances of conceptual frameworks that have been associated with systems theory,
social contexts, and mixed-methods approaches to research in development guidelines. Doing so
may provide developers with kinds of organizing frameworks, including the role of underlying
philosophical positions, assumptions, commitments and what counts as evidence of rigour and
validity. Second, those developing frameworks should consider three when developing a
framework in order to align purpose with process: “binary/continuum; atomistic/holistic; and,
context-specific/context-general” (Child and Shaw 2019). These arguments require developers to
explicitly consider the scope or intended use of the framework (which will inform their validity
arguments); the level of granularity (which will inform their methods and alignment); and, the
contexts in which the framework may be enacted (which will inform the degree of contextual
specificity required in the development process). If we integrate organizing frameworks of these
kinds and associated arguments into guidelines, it may lead to better alignment between intended
uses, methods and sequences such that they are deemed “fit for purpose”. This shifts the
emphasis from what or how many methods were used – since any one method can be aligned
with more than one purpose – to the theoretical and functional alignment of methods with the
rationale for development and intended uses (Child and Shaw 2019). Until implementation of
these types of guidelines, we suggest that interpretation of the utility and validity of outcomes
(i.e., competency frameworks) may be more variable or less certain (Arundel et al. 2019; Child
and Shaw 2019; Simera et al. 2008).
Figure 3. Conceptual framework

In addition to improved developmental guidelines, we may also support developers and users of
competency frameworks through the creation of reporting guidelines that provide structure and
clarity (Moher 2007; Moher et al. 2011; Simera et al. 2010). This may include reference to our
recommendations above but also incorporate a format that borrows from recently described
layered analyses for educational interventions (Cianciolo and Regehr 2019; Horsley and Regehr
2018; Varpio et al. 2012). Applied to competency framework development, techniques may be
regarded as surface functions or selected methodologies that are highly context dependent, with
underlying principles and philosophy that are context independent. This may help to account for

the flexibility required when we attempt to provide guidance to multiple professions across
varying contexts. We submit that the suitability, utility and validity of outcomes may leave too
much room for interpretation without explicit consideration of the proposals outlined above.
However, we acknowledge that the inconsistent adherence to existing guidance we observed in
this review suggests that future guidance may also face challenges to implementation.
Limitations
Our study needs to be considered in the context of its limitations. We may not have identified all
relevant studies despite attempts to be comprehensive. While our search strategy included terms
previously used to describe the development of competency frameworks in various professions,
others may exist. The keywords used to index papers lack consistency and a wide variety of
descriptive terms are used in abstracts. Our search and review was restricted to articles published
in English, but this does not inherently bias a review (Morrison et al. 2012). The Google Scholar
search was limited to the first 1000 results; however, the first 200–300 results from Google
Scholar are considered adequate for grey literature searches (Haddaway et al. 2015). No new
codes were generated after approximately 50 articles were coded, which suggests that the
inclusion of additional literature would likely not have influenced the overall findings of our
review. Due to the lack of detail provided by many authors regarding their underlying
assumptions, rationale, selection, and conduct of methods, our review cannot provide a concrete
overview of all aspects of each included study. Finally, the dynamic nature of research into
competency frameworks, EPAs, and the general discourse on competency based education may
be considered a limitation. However, our review offers a comprehensive overview of the
development of competency frameworks to date along with suggestions for future directions and
research.
Conclusion
Our review identified and explored the research pertaining to competency framework
development. Research to date has focused predominantly on the framework outcomes, with
considerably less attention devoted to the process of development. Our findings demonstrated
that the development process varied substantially, across and within professions, in the choice of
methods and in the reporting of the process. There is evidence of inconsistent adherence to
existing guidance and a suggestion that existing guidelines may be insufficient. This may result
in uncertainty regarding the utility and validity of the outcomes, which may lead to unintended or
unwarranted legitimacy. In light of our findings, the development process for competency
framework development may benefit from improved guidance. This guidance should obligate a
focus on organizing conceptual frameworks that promote the functional alignment of methods
and strategies with intended uses and contexts. In addition, such guidance should assist
developers to determine approaches that may be better positioned to overcome many of the
challenges associated with competency framework development, including sufficiently capturing
the complexities of practice. Extending existing guidelines in these ways may be complemented
with further research on the implementation, reporting, and evaluation of competency
frameworks outcomes.
