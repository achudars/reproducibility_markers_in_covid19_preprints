Abstract

23

Background: Physical activity (PA) plays a role in the prevention of a range of diseases

24

including obesity and cardiometabolic disorders. Large population-based descriptive

25

studies of PA, incorporating precise measurement, are needed to understand the

26

relative burden of insufficient PA levels and to inform the tailoring of interventions.

Methods: The Fenland study is a population-based cohort study of 12,435 adults aged

33

29–64 years-old in Cambridgeshire, UK. Following individual calibration (treadmill),

34

participants wore a combined heart rate and movement sensor continuously for 6 days

35

in free-living, from which we derived PAEE (kJ•day-1•kg-1) and time in MVPA (>3 & >4

36

METs) in bouts greater than 1 minute and 10 minutes. Socio-demographic information

37

was self-reported. Stratum-specific summary statistics and multivariable analyses were

38

performed.

Results: Women accumulated a mean(sd) 50(20) kJ•day-1•kg-1 of PAEE, and 83(67)

41

and 33(39) minutes•day-1 of 1-min bouted and 10-min bouted MVPA respectively. By

42

contrast, men recorded 59(23) kJ•day-1•kg-1, 124(84) and 60(58) minutes•day-1. Age

43

and BMI were also important correlates of PA. Association with age was inverse in both

44

sexes, more strongly so for PAEE than MVPA. Obese individuals accumulated less PA

Conclusions: PA varied by age, sex and BMI, and was higher in manual workers and

those with higher incomes. Light physical activity was the main driver of PAEE; a

Background

69
70

Physical activity (PA) plays an important role in the prevention of a range of diseases

71

including obesity and cardiometabolic disorders [1–3].

72

behavioural target for public health interventions, and guidelines describing desired

73

levels of PA have been proposed [4, 5]. In order to assess the population burden of

74

insufficient levels of PA, and develop effective, tailored interventions, it is important to

75

describe physical activity levels and examine the socio-demographic correlates.

It is hence an important

76
77

Human behaviour occurs across an intensity spectrum ranging from sleep and

78

sedentary behaviour (SS), to light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical activity

79

(MPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA). Typically, these intensities are grouped

80

according to a metabolic equivalent of task (METs), e.g. LPA considered as 1.5-3

81

METs, MPA as 3-6 METs, and VPA as greater than 6 METs, although such

82

classification is far from universal [6]. Recent updates in physical activity guidelines

83

emphasize the importance of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) but increasingly

84

recognise the importance of all subcomponents of the entire intensity spectrum [4].

85

Moreover, the 2018 guidelines for Americans no longer include the requirement for

86

activity to occur in bouts of at least 10-min duration. Whilst other countries may adopt

87

this definition, it is far from universal and the consequences of such reclassification in

88

terms of activity levels in different socio-demographic groups are not well documented

89

with objective measurements in large cohorts.

91

Objectively measured PAEE of smaller British cohorts has been reported, including a

92

nationally representative sample of children and adults measured with the doubly

93

labelled water method [7]; however, this method can only assess total volume of PAEE,

94

and the sample was too small (n = 770) to describe socio-demographic differences. Two

95

other British cohort studies have described PAEE and its underlying intensity

96

distribution, one in adolescents aged 16y and one in older adults aged between 60 and

97

64y, respectively [8, 9]. The descriptive epidemiology of PAEE and intensity in younger

98

to middle-aged UK adults has not yet been reported. To fill this knowledge gap, we used

99

data from the Fenland cohort, an ongoing population-based observational study of

100

12,435 adults aged 29-64 years of age, residing in Cambridgeshire, UK. We aimed to

101

describe the objectively measured levels of PAEE and underlying intensity patterns by

102

socio-demographic characteristics.

103
104

Methods

105

Study population

106

Participants born between 1950 and 1975 were recruited to the Fenland Study from

107

general practice lists between 2005 and 2015. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy,

108

physician-diagnosed diabetes, inability to walk unaided, psychosis, and terminal illness.

109

In total, 12,435 participants, aged 29–64 years old, were enrolled and attended one of

110

three clinical research facilities (Ely, Cambridge, and Wisbech) after an overnight fast.

111

All participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the

112

local ethics committee (NRES Committee – East of England Cambridge Central) and

113

performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, approval was

granted to compare general practice-held information (age, sex, height, weight,

115

smoking, alcohol consumption, area deprivation score) for participants with the overall

116

eligible sample (under UK Section 251 legislation).

117
118

Anthropometry and other clinical measures

119

Height was measured with a rigid stadiometer (SECA 240; Seca, Birmingham, UK) and

120

weight was measured in light clothing with calibrated scales (TANITA model BC-418

121

MA; Tanita, Tokyo, Japan). Seated blood pressure was measured with an automated

122

sphygmomanometer (Omron, 705CP-II) and a 12-lead ECG (Seca CT6i) was obtained

123

during supine rest. Participants were cleared for submaximal exercise testing if blood

124

pressure was <180/110 mm Hg, no serious anomalies were observed on the ECG,

125

alongside appropriate responses to medical screening questions and a review of

126

medication (e.g. high-dose betablocker use were excluded from the treadmill test).

127
128

Objective physical activity assessment

129

Participants were fitted with a combined heart rate and uniaxial movement sensor

130

(Actiheart, CamNtech, Papworth, UK), attached to the chest with standard ECG

131

electrodes [10]. Participants had their heart rate measured continuously during a 6-min

132

supine rest test and then underwent a submaximal treadmill test consisting of 9-min of

133

walking on the flat with increasing speed, 6-min walking at increased gradient, and 5-

134

min of jogging on the flat as previously described [11]. Heart rate was measured

135

continuously and the test was terminated when heart rate reached 90% of age-

136

predicted maximum [12], or had been above 80% for longer than 2-min, or the

137

participant requested to stop. At the end of the clinical visit, participants were asked to

138

wear the heart rate and movement sensor, initialised to collect date at 1-min resolution,

139

for the following 6 days [10], and to return the monitor by freepost. Participants were

140

advised that the device was waterproof and should be worn continuously, including

141

during showering, water-based activities, and sleeping, whilst continuing with their usual

142

activities. It could be removed to change electrodes, spare sets of which were provided.

143
144

Following pre-processing of the free-living heart rate data to eliminate potential noise

145

[13], heart rate was individually calibrated using parameters obtained from the treadmill

146

test [11] and combined with acceleration in a branched equation model [14] to calculate

147

instantaneous PAEE (J•kg-1•min-1); this measure of intensity agrees well with intensity

148

measured using indirect calorimetry [15, 16]. For participants without sufficient treadmill

149

data for individual calibration (n = 468 of 12002), an age-, sex-, and sleeping heart rate

150

(SHR) adjusted group calibration was used, derived on all other participants as follows:

154

participant was taking betablocker medication).

156

Intensity was expressed in standard metabolic equivalents (METs), using 1 MET = 71

157

J•min-1•kg-1 (~3.5 ml O2•min-1•kg-1).

158
159

Segments of data with continuous zero acceleration lasting ≥90 minutes were classified

160

as ‘non-wear’ if also accompanied by non-physiological HR data, i.e. consistently high

161

Bayesian error [17]. Average daily PAEE (in kJ•day-1•kg-1) and time spent at multiple

162

intensity levels (up to 10 METs) and in at least moderate intensity bouts was

163

summarised, whilst minimising potential diurnal bias by imbalance of wear time [18].

164

This method has been successfully validated against PAEE from doubly-labelled water

165

in UK men and women [19]. Time and energy spent at specific intensity levels were

166

grouped together and defined as sedentary/sleep (SS), light physical activity (LPA),

167

moderate physical activity (MPA) and vigorous physical activity (MPA). Activity bouts of

168

at least 3 and 4 MET (moderate) intensity were calculated in durations ranging from 1 to

169

10 mins. For the primary analysis SS was defined as < 1.5 METs, LPA as 1.5-3 METs,

170

MPA as 3-6 METs, and VPA as >6 MET. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using

171

LPA as 1.5-4 METs, MPA as 4-7 METs, and VPA as >7 METs, and allometrically scaled

172

PAEE (in kJ•day-1•kg-2/3) as previously described [20, 21].

173
174

For the present analysis, participants were excluded (n=351) if they had worn their

175

sensors for <72 hours overall, or <8 hours accumulative wear for each quadrant of the

176

day (3am to 9am, 9am to 3pm, 3pm to 9pm, 9pm to 3am). Furthermore, activity records

177

were excluded if they did not measure 0 m•s-2 at some point (indicating no movement)

181

Covariates

182

Socio-demographic and lifestyle behavioural information was collected using self-report.

183

This included age, sex, ethnicity, work-type/status (sedentary, standing, manual, retired,

184

unemployed), marital status (single, married/cohabiting, widowed/separated/divorced),

185

education (compulsory, further – A-level/apprenticeship/sub-degree level, higher –

186

degree level or above), household income level (<£20,000, £20,000 - £40,000,

187

>£40,000), smoking status (never, former, current) and alcohol intake (units/week). In

188

addition, location (Cambridge, Ely, Wisbech) and season of physical activity

189

measurement was considered (coded as two orthogonal sine functions; “Winter”

190

peaking at 1 on January 1st and reaching a minimum of -1 on July 1st, and Spring

191

peaking at 1 on April 1st and reaching a minimum of -1 on October 1st).

Statistics

194

All analyses were sex-stratified. We report medians (inter-quartile ranges) or means

195

(standard deviations) for descriptive purposes for continuous variables and proportions

196

for categorical variables. We performed linear test for trend of activity differences for

197

ordinal covariates and likelihood-ratio tests for categorical covariates. We used sex-

198

stratified multivariable linear regression to model the independent associations of

199

activity outcomes with age, BMI, education level, work-type, income, marital status, test

site, smoking status, ethnicity, and season of activity measurement. For this analysis,

201

missing data in categorical variables were coded as a separate category.

202
203

Using all available information from the general practices, we compared all invited vs all

204

participating by two-sample, unpaired t-test for continuous variables and chi square test

205

for categorical variables. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE version

206

208

Results

209

A total of 46,024 individuals were invited, of whom 12,435 (27% response rate) agreed

210

to participate. General practice information was obtained on 45,043 individuals including

211

12,145 study participants; one practice could not provide any standard information

212

(n=180), and a few additional participants did not consent to this linkage, had no valid

213

NHS number or their GP surgery information was missing (n=110). Compared to the

214

overall sampling frame participants were approximately 18 months older, had lower BMI

215

[0.2 (men); 0.8 (women) kg/m2 lower], were less likely to smoke, and had marginally

216

lower deprivation scores. Although there was a higher prevalence of alcohol drinkers,

217

participants drank fewer units per week (Supplementary Table 1).

218
219

Of the 12,435 participants, 12,002 (91% White) met the combined sensing inclusion

220

criteria for the present analysis, more women (n=6,428) than men (n=5,574). This

221

subsample did not significantly differ from the full Fenland sample, with the exception of

222

men being 0.1 years younger (p=0.02).

Mean (SD) PAEE for women was 50 (20) kJ•day-1•kg-1 compared to 59 (23) kJ•day-1•kg-

226

of which 33 (39) min/day occurred in bouts of 10-min or longer, whereas men recorded

227

124 (85) and 60 (58) min/day, respectively. Of note, despite the differences in PAEE

228

and MVPA as measured by combined sensing, women and men did not differ by chest

229

acceleration. Further participant characteristics are listed in Table 1 and univariable

230

analysis by category in Supplementary Table 2.

for men (Table 1). Women recorded an average of 83 (67) minutes per day of MVPA,

231
232

Age and BMI were important correlates of PAEE, 1-minute bouted MVPA and 10-minute

233

bouted MVPA, with levels of all three outcomes significantly lower in the oldest age

234

group (60-64y) than the youngest age (group 29-34y), and in those classified as obese

235

compared to normal weight participants (Table 2; p < 0.01). Figure 1 presents box plots

236

(median and IQR) of PAEE by three age categories and three BMI groups (29-44y, 45-

237

54y, 55-64y; normal weight, overweight, obese) and is reflective of the overall age and

238

BMI trends with respect to PAEE. In both men and women, PAEE was highest in

239

younger age categories and progressively lower in those 45 years and onwards. PAEE

240

was consistently lower with advancing age than MVPA, which was not significantly

241

different in either sex between those in their 30s and 40s, but lower in those in the 6th

242

and 7th decade of life (Table 2). Similarly, those with the lowest BMI recorded the

243

highest levels of PA, with gradually lower levels noted with higher BMI; a trend which

244

was more pronounced in women. Sensitivity analysis conducted with allometrically

245

scaled PAEE confirmed BMI to be a significant correlate of PAEE and MVPA, with

246

differences between normal weight and obese participants preserved (Supplementary

247

Table 3). Proportion of week/weekend wear was not associated with PAEE but there

248

was a trend towards those recruited later in the study period of 2005 to 2015 having

249

lower activity levels.

250
251

Across the sample, LPA was the primary contributor of energy to total PAEE (59%

252

women, 51% men), although men accumulated higher levels of MPA and VPA than

253

women (Figure 2). However, the majority of time was spent asleep or sedentary (70%

254

women, 69% men), demonstrating the paradox that participants spent a relatively small

255

fraction of the day accumulating most of their PAEE. Women spent almost all their time

256

below 9 METs and men below 11 METS (Supplementary Figure 1).

257

demonstrated a similar association with age as for PAEE; time in LPA was lower in

258

older participants, with a reciprocal higher time spent asleep or sedentary. This was

259

accompanied by a commensurate lower PAEE derived from LPA in older participants.

Time use

260
261

Multivariable analysis (Table 2) showed further correlates of PA, including ethnicity,

262

work-type, income, and smoker status. Ethnic minorities tended to be less active than

263

White participants, although the sample sizes of some groups are too small to assess

264

this with certainty. Participants with more physically demanding jobs also had higher

265

activity levels; however retired individuals were more active than those with sedentary

266

occupations. When adjusted for all other socioeconomic variables, this equated to

267

women in manual occupations accumulating 13 kJ•day-1•kg-1 more PAEE than those in

268

sedentary jobs, and 38 and 18 more minutes of MVPA in bouts of >1 minute and >10

269

minutes respectively. In men, corresponding differences were 16 kJ•day-1•kg-1, 56 and

270

29 min/day.

271
272

Education was not significantly associated with PA after adjustment (Table 2). However,

273

there was some indication of higher activity levels in those with higher socio-economic

274

status, more so in men for income level. This picture was mixed as demonstrated by the

275

higher activity in men and trend towards lower activity in women from the Wisbech site,

276

compared to the more affluent Cambridge site. A sex difference was also observed for

277

civil status, in that marriage (current or former) was positively associated with activity in

278

men but tended to be inversely associated in women, compared to single status.

279

Current and former smokers tended to have higher PAEE and MVPA than non-smokers

280

for both sexes; however, smokers moved less when only considering the accelerometry

281

component (Supplementary Table 2). Participants who were measured in the summer

282

were more active than those measured in the winter; this difference was twice as big in

283

men as in women, i.e. 20-min and 10-min difference in 1-minute bouted MVPA between

284

mid-winter and mid-summer.

285
286

Overall, compliance with the current UK PA guidelines (as defined by 150 minutes of

287

MVPA per week in bouts > 10minutes) was higher in men than in women; 49% of

288

women and 74% of men accumulated at least 21.4 min of MVPA/day (equivalent to

289

meeting the guidelines of 150 min MVPA per week) in bouts lasting 10-min or longer

290

when MVPA was defined as > 3 METs. When redefined at MVPA > 3 METs of at least

291

1-minute duration, however, compliance was 86% and 96%, respectively. Conversely,

redefining MVPA with the higher 4 METs cut-off naturally resulted in lower absolute

293

levels of MVPA and guideline compliance, as highlighted in Figure 3. Using a 4 MET

294

threshold and 10-minute bout definition, only 15% of women and 31% of men

295

accumulated the recommended levels of MVPA. Participants accumulated less than half

296

the amount of 10-minute bouted MVPA than 1-minute bouted MVPA, irrespective of sex

297

or MVPA cut-offs. Using the stricter definition of MVPA, sensitivity analyses of the

298

association with sociodemographic factors (Supplementary Table 1) showed largely

299

similar patterns of association to the primary analysis.

Discussion

302

In this study we present the descriptive epidemiology of physical activity in a population-

303

sample of UK adults. To our knowledge, this is the first study that describes socio-

304

demographic patterns of both PAEE and its underlying intensity distribution in a large

305

cohort of younger to middle-aged adults.

306
307

Our results indicate that men accumulate higher levels of PAEE than women across all

308

ages; a finding consistent with other descriptive studies [7, 22–24]. Men also

309

accumulate higher levels of MVPA and expend more of their energy at higher intensities

310

than women. Despite the energy expenditure differences between men and women as

311

measured by combined sensing, there was no sex difference in movement as measured

312

by accelerometry, as has also been observed in other cohorts [25].

314

Among both men and women PA was lower in older individuals. Moreover, the levels

315

and age-associated differences in PAEE demonstrated in Figure 1 are similar to that

316

recently reported in UK nationally representative samples [7], and the age association

317

remained significant in multivariable analysis (Table 2). Although PAEE and MVPA were

318

highest in young adults, the pattern of association with age was quite different. Whereas

319

PAEE was significantly different between all but the youngest two groups in women and

320

youngest three groups in men, MVPA in >1-min bouts was only significantly different

321

between the reference groups and those above 50y (p < 0.05). Furthermore, MVPA in

322

10-min bouts was only significantly different between the youngest group and the oldest

323

two age groups in both sexes. This finding suggests that intensity patterns of PA may

324

be preserved differently as people age, with light LPA replaced by sedentary behaviour

325

proportionally more rapidly than decreases in MVPA.

326
327

Normal-weight individuals accumulated higher levels of all activity outcomes than obese

328

individuals. The difference in PAEE between normal weight and obese women was

329

similar to the difference between sedentary and manual workers and between

330

participants in the oldest and youngest age categories. The same comparisons hold

331

true for men. This finding was consistent in a sensitivity analysis for allometrically scaled

332

PAEE (Supplementary Table 3), suggesting that obesity is negatively associated with

333

levels of PA in both sexes, irrespective of the effect of body size on absolute energy

334

expenditure.

336

In terms of socio-demographic correlates of PAEE and MVPA, our unadjusted results

337

demonstrated that educational level, income, work type, and smoking status were

338

associated with PAEE and MVPA in women and men. Yet, when mutually adjusted in

339

the multivariable analysis, some of these differences were attenuated. For example,

340

univariable analysis showed a 16 kJ•day-1•kg-1 difference between men with sedentary

341

jobs and men with manual jobs. Likewise, univariable analysis modelled a 6 kJ•day-1•kg-

342

343

education.

344

between PAEE and education in men decreased in magnitude and significance,

345

whereas the association with different work types remained significant, and of an order

346

of magnitude almost identical to univariable analysis. A similar trend was evident in

347

women. This is due to the strong correlations between certain sociodemographic

348

variables such as lower levels of education and manual work. Conversely, higher levels

349

of education tended to be associated with less PA (in men) but must be balanced

350

against the higher levels of PAEE and MVPA seen with increasing income.

When controlled for all sociodemographic covariates, the association

351
352

Similarly, the higher attributed levels of PAEE in smokers should be considered in the

353

context of significantly lower accelerometry-measured PA in current smokers of both

354

sexes in multivariable analysis (Supplementary Table 3). Smoking is known to increase

355

energy expenditure, independent of movement and resting energy expenditure [26].

356

Moreover, this combination of results may be a partial by-product of the acute increase

357

in heart rate of 15 beats/min that has been observed in cigarette smokers [27], which

358

may have biased the estimates of energy expenditure.

360

The levels of PAEE in the Fenland cohort are comparable to those reported in the

361

nationally representative sample of the UK population studied with the gold-standard

362

method of doubly labelled water in NDNS [7]. That study reported mean (SD) PAEE of

363

52 (20) and 47 (17) kJ•day-1•kg-1 in women aged 16–49 and 50–64 respectively. By

364

contrast, men accumulated 63 (23) and 54 (20) kJ•day-1•kg-1 in the same age groups.

365

The Cambridge-based ROOTS study reported higher PAEE levels of 83.5 and 65.9

366

kJ•day-1•kg-1 in 825, 16-year old boys and girls respectively [8]. By contrast, Golubic et

367

al reported comparatively lower PAEE levels in the nationally representative 1946 birth

368

cohort of British women and men assessed at age 60-64 years (median (IQR) PAEE:

369

33.5 and 35.5 kJ•day-1•kg-1 respectively) [9],suggesting possible regional differences

370

within the UK.

371
372

Comparing the Fenland cohort to populations living in locations of differing global

373

developmental indices, we note that various rural cohorts in Africa are more active.

374

However, while men living in urban environments in developing countries have

375

comparable levels of PA to their Cambridgeshire counterparts, women are notably less

376

active. For example, Kenyan men of Kamba, Maasai and Luo ethnic origins had PAEE

377

levels of 81, 78 and 74 kJ•day-1•kg-1 (age-adjusted to 40 years), respectively [23]. In

378

contrast, Cameroonian and Barbadian urban men recorded comparable levels of PAEE

379

to Fenland men (Cameroon: 52 kJ•day-1•kg-1, 37-years-old; Barbadian: 47 kJ•day-1•kg-1,

380

25-54 years-old) whereas Fenland women were more active than the women in those

381

populations (Cameroon: 38 kJ•day-1•kg-1, 38-years-old; Barbadian: 36 kJ•day-1•kg-1, 25-

382

54 years-old) [22, 24]. This suggests different sex-specific determinants of PAEE in the

383

developed as opposed to the developing world, and rural compared to urbanised

384

environments.

385
386

Our study also demonstrates how the definition of MVPA influences the reported

387

prevalence of compliance with physical activity guidelines.

388

guidelines are undergoing review [28], the difference in the quantity of MVPA

389

accumulated in bouts of at least 1-min duration vs at least 10-min duration is critical.

390

Through the simple abolition of the 10-min bouted criterion, apparent compliance falls

391

from 86% to 49% in women and 96% to 74% in men (Figure 3). This difference reflects

392

characterisation according to the new US guidelines [4], as opposed to the 2010 UK

393

guidelines [5]. Furthermore, the new US guidelines emphasise the role of all physical

394

activity in health. Our study suggests that LPA plays a crucial role in the accumulation of

395

overall PAEE, accounting for roughly two thirds of PAEE in women and over half of

396

PAEE in men (Figure 2). Indeed, without reasonable levels of LPA, it is hard to

397

accumulate high levels of PAEE. Therefore, LPA’s role in health should not be

398

underestimated.

Strengths of this study include individually calibrated combined heart rate and

401

movement-based assessment of PAEE and underlying intensity in a large population-

402

based sample that compares well in terms of PAEE with a nationally representative

403

sample measured by gold-standard measures (i.e. NDNS)[7]. The large sample allowed

404

for detailed description of physical activity by several sociodemographic variables. A

405

further strength is our ability to quantify potential selection bias by comparison of the

406

recruited cohort to the sampling frame population in Cambridgeshire. Whilst this does

407

suggest that the participants are slightly healthier (lower BMI, smoke less, and drink

408

fewer units of alcohol per week) and live in less deprived areas, the differences are

409

small and their likely impact on quantified activity levels not always in the same

410

direction, hence some of the bias will cancel out. Limitations of the study include its lack

411

of representativeness compared to the rest of the UK, in particular the predominance of

412

White participants.

413
414

Conclusions

415

In this study we have described the objectively measured physical activity levels of

416

young to middle-aged adults in the East of England, which are similar to those reported

417

in the nationally representative NDNS study [7]. As with other British studies age, sex

418

and BMI were important correlates of physical activity. We have additionally shown work

419

type, income and smoker status to be associated with MVPA and energy expenditure.

420

Overall, 86% of women and 96% of men met the most liberal criteria for the PA

421

guidelines compared to 15% and 31% respectively for the strictest. Uniquely, we have

422

identified LPA as the main driver of PAEE; a component of PA that is currently not

423

quantified as a target in UK guidelines.
