Abstract

26

Background: Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric

27

symptoms; however, vitamin B deficiency epidemiology in patients with intense

28

psychiatric episode has rarely been examined. Moreover, vitamin deficiency testing is

29

costly and time-consuming, which has hampered effectively ruling out vitamin

30

deficiency-induced intense psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we aimed to clarify the

31

epidemiology of these deficiencies and efficiently predict them using machine-learning

32

models from patient characteristics and routine blood test results that can be obtained

33

within one hour.

34

Methods: We reviewed 497 consecutive patients deemed to be at imminent risk of

35

seriously harming themselves or others over 2 years in a single psychiatric tertiary-care

36

center. Machine-learning models (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support

37

vector machine, and random forest) were trained to predict each deficiency from age,

38

sex, and 29 routine blood test results gathered in the period from September 2015 to

39

December 2016. The models were validated using a dataset collected from January

40

2017 through August 2017.

41

Results: We found that 112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients had vitamin

42

B1, vitamin B12, and folate (vitamin B9) deficiency, respectively. Further, the

43

machine-learning models were well generalized to predict deficiency in the future

44

unseen data, especially using random forest; areas under the receiver operating

45

characteristic curves for the validation dataset (i.e. the dataset not used for training the

46

models) were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, respectively. The Gini importance of these

47

vitamins provided further evidence of a relationship between these vitamins and the

48

complete blood count, while also indicating a hitherto rarely considered, potential

49

association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid

50

stimulating hormone (TSH).

Discussion: This study demonstrates that machine-learning can efficiently predict some

52

vitamin deficiencies in patients with active psychiatric symptoms, based on the largest

53

cohort to date with intense psychiatric episode. The prediction method may expedite

54

risk stratification and clinical decision-making regarding whether replacement therapy

55

should be prescribed. Further research includes validating its external generalizability in

56

other clinical situations and clarify whether interventions based on this method could

57

improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.

1. Introduction
Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric

61

symptoms1–4. For example, meta-analyses have shown that patients with schizophrenia

62

or first-episode psychosis have lower folate (vitamin B9) levels than their healthy

63

counterparts4,5. Moreover, vitamin therapy can effectively alleviate symptoms in a

64

subgroup of patients with schizophrenia3,6–8. However, the epidemiology of vitamin B

65

deficiency in patients with active mental symptoms requiring immediate hospitalization

66

has rarely been examined.

67

In a psychiatric emergency, psychiatrists should promptly distinguish treatable

68

patients with altered mental status due to a physical disease from patients with an

69

authentic mental disorder (international statistical classification of diseases and related

70

health problems-10, ICD-10 code: F2-9). However, vitamin deficiency testing is very

71

costly (around 60 dollars for each measurement of vitamin B1 (vitB1), vitamin B12

72

(vitB12), or folate in the U.S.; 15–25 dollars for each test in Japan) and usually requires

73

at least two days. Therefore, an efficient, cost-effective method of predicting vitamin B

74

deficiency is needed.

75

Although several studies have applied machine-learning to the prediction of

76

diagnosis or treatment outcomes9–11, no study using machine-learning has focused on

77

vitamin B deficiencies. We herein explore whether vitB1, vitB12, and folate deficiencies

78

can be predicted using a machine-learning classifier from patient characteristics and

79

routine blood test results obtained within one hour based on a large cohort of patients

80
81

requiring urgent psychiatric hospitalization.

2. Methods

83

2.1. Medical chart review

84

We reviewed consecutive patients admitted to the Department of

85

Neuropsychiatry at Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, one of the biggest

86

psychiatric tertiary-care centers in Japan, between September 2015 and August 2017

87

under the urgent involuntary hospitalization law, which requires the immediate

88

psychiatric hospitalization of patients at imminent risk of seriously harming themselves

89

or others. The necessity of hospitalization was judged by designated mental health

90

specialists. There were no exclusion criteria. The patient characteristics, ICD-10 codes,

91

and laboratory data were gathered retrospectively.

92

Since the reference ranges for vitB1, vitB12, and folate are 70–180 nmol/L

93

(30–77 ng/mL), 180–914 ng/L, and > 4.0 μg/L, respectively12, a deficiency of the

94

nutrients was defined as < 30 ng/mL, < 180 ng/L, and < 4.0 μg/L, respectively, unless

95

otherwise stated. The odds ratios of each deficiency in each ICD-10 code were

96

calculated assuming binomial distribution.

97
98
99

2.2. Classifiers and statistics
We compared four types of standard machine-learning classifiers; k-nearest

100

neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. Each type of

101

classifier was trained to predict the deficiency of each substance from age, sex, and 29

102

routine blood variables (described in the Result section with values). For developing the

103

models, any missing values were replaced using the mean. The classifiers were trained

104

using the dataset populated in the period from September 2015 to December 2016 (the

105

“Training set”). First, except for logistic regression, we optimized the hyperparameters

106

of the classifier by selecting the best combination of hyperparameters that maximized

107

the "5-fold cross validation" accuracy, among many combinations within appropriate

108

ranges. The cross-validation accuracy was computed as follows; in one session, the

109

classifiers were trained using 80% of the training set and evaluated on the withheld 20%

110

of the training set. This session was performed five times so that every data would be

111

withheld once. The accuracies were finally averaged across sessions to yield the

112

cross-validation accuracy. By incorporating this process, the classifiers were

113

generalized to unseen data (Graphical method is shown in Figure 1).

114

Using the optimized hyperparameters, the classifiers were then validated using

115

data collected from January 2017 through August 2017 (the “Validation set”). We

116

report the classification performance on the validation set in the results section unless

117

otherwise stated.

118

We quantified the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (defined as the average

119

of the sensitivity and the specificity on the optimal operating point) using receiver

120

operating characteristic curves (ROCs). We also quantified the 95% confidence interval

121

of the area under the ROCs (AUCs) and accuracy using 1000-times bootstrapping.

122

When investigating the Gini importance and the partial dependency13, we

123

retrained the classifiers using all datasets. All data analyses were performed using

124

Python (2.7.10) with the Scikit-learn package (0.19.0) and R (3.4.2) with the edarf

125

package (1.1.1) and pROC package (1.15.3).

126
127
128

2.3. Robustness verification
We verified the robustness of the prediction performances by three independent

129

approaches. First, we compared the following two prediction performances; random

130

forest classifiers trained and validated using the dataset from the F2 population, and

131

random forest classifiers trained and validated using the dataset from the non-F2

132

population.

133

Second, we compared the prediction performances of several random forest

134

classifiers trained and validated using the dataset where different cut-off values were

135

used to define the vitamin deficiency. We chose other two cut-off values for each

136

vitamin based on previous reports14–16, as well as pre-defined cut-off values (see also

137

2.1.).

138

Third, we trained and validated other random forest classifiers where the

139

dataset was split in a different way. Here, the training set consisted of data between the

140

31st of January, 2016 and August 2017 and the validation set consisted of data between

141

September 2015 and the 31st of January, 2016 so that the sample sizes of the training

142

and validation sets were equal to those in the original split.

143
144

2.4. Subsampling analysis

145

We also examined the relationship between the dataset size and the

146

generalization performance17. In this analysis, we trained the random forest classifiers

147

using X% of the training set (X = 30, 35, 40, …, 95, and 100), and validated them using

148

the validation set. The hyperparameters were identical to those used in the previous

149

section. To remove sampling bias, this procedure was repeated 100 times for each value

150

of X, where the training dataset was sampled randomly for each repetition. This results

151

in obtaining 100 AUC scores for each X and for each vitamin. We plotted the AUC

152

scores (averaged across the 100 repetition) versus X for each vitamin. Then the curve

153

was fit with the following saturating function using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm

154

implemented as “curve_fit” function in the Scipy package (0.19.0).

3. Results

165

3.1. Eligible patients

166

During the 2-year study period, 497 consecutive patients (496 were Asian)

167

were enrolled. The mean age (standard deviation, SD) was 42.3 (±15.4) years, and 228

168

patients (45.9%) were women. F2 (Schizophrenia, schizotypal, delusional, and other

169

non-mood psychotic disorders) was diagnosed in over 60% of the patients. The ICD-10

170

codes of the patients and the number of deficiencies at several cut-off values for vitB1,

171

vitB12, and folate are shown in Table 1. According to the predefined cut-off values12,

172

112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients exhibited a deficiency of vitB1 (<30

173

ng/mL), vitB12 (<180 ng/L), and folate (<4.0 μg/L), respectively. Vitamin B deficiencies

174

in sub-groups are shown in Table 2. A summary of the full dataset is shown in Table 3.

175

Detailed information (sub-datasets) is shown in Supplementary Table 1, 2, and 3

176

online. Histograms of vitB1, vitB12, and folate values are shown in Figure 2 A-C.

177
178
179

3.2. Prediction via machine-learning using routine blood test results
Machine-learning classifiers were trained to predict the deficiency of each

180

substance from patient characteristics and routine blood test results. The classifiers were

181

trained using the dataset gathered in the period from September 2015 to December 2016

182

(the “Training set”, n = 373), which was then validated from January 2017 through

183

August 2017 (the “Validation set”, n = 124). By splitting the whole dataset in this way,

184

the ratio of the training and validation sample size was 3:1, a commonly used ratio in

185

machine-learning analyses.

186

AUCs for the validation set for each classifier are summarized in Table 4.

187

Although the performance of the classifiers was similar except for the k-nearest

188

neighbors, random forest yielded the highest AUC on average. Therefore, we focused

189

on random forest in the following analysis.

190

The AUCs of the random forest classifiers were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, for

191

vitB1, vitB12, and folate, respectively (Figure 2 D-F and Table 4). With some operative

192

points on the ROC, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the validation set were

193

calculated (Table 4. See also Supplementary Table 4 for training set and

194

Supplementary Table 5 for different operating points). The 95% confidence interval

195

(CI) of the AUC and accuracy was quantified using 1000-times bootstrapping. For

196

random forest classifiers, the 95% CI of each value did not include 0.5, except for the

197

AUC of vitB12.

198

Figure 3 shows the Gini importance (a–c) and partial dependency plots (d–f)

199

for the eight most important variables for each substance. The results provided further

200

evidence of a relationship between the vitamin B levels and complete blood count while

201

also indicating the hitherto rarely considered, potential association between these

202

vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

203
204

3.3. Robustness verification

205

We verified the robustness of the results by three independent means. First, we

206

asked if the prediction performance was influenced by the ICD-10 categories. When the

207

prediction performances were compared between the random forest classifiers trained

208

using the dataset from the F2 population and the classifiers trained using the dataset

209

from the other population, the AUC was not statistically different (DeLong’s test),

210

except in the case of vitB1 (see Supplementary Table 6).

211

Second, we used different cut-off values to define the deficiency14–16. Although

212

the AUC for the validation set, shown in Supplementary Table 7, tended to be higher

213

when strict cut-off values were used, the obtained AUCs were not statistically

214

significant (p > 0.05, DeLong’s test with Bonferroni correction).

215
216

Third, we investigated if the prediction performance was influenced by the way
the dataset was split into the training and validation set. Here, we trained and evaluated

217

random forest classifiers using a dataset split in a reversed way (see Methods for

218

details); The AUCs for the validation set were 0.771, 0.621, and 0.745 for vitB1, vitB12,

219

and folate, respectively; none were statistically different from the AUC trained using the

220

original setting (DeLong’s test), further demonstrating the robustness of the

221

performance.

222
223

3.4. Subsampling analysis

224

To estimate the number needed to saturate the performance, we examined the

225

relationship between the generalizability and the sample size17. We randomly sampled

226

X% of the training set, trained random forest classifiers using the dataset, and evaluated

227

the generalization performance by AUCs using the validation set (X = 30, 35, 40, …, 95,

228

and 100; see Methods for details). As shown in Figure 4, the relationships between

229

AUC and the training size for vitB1 and vitB12 were almost saturated, whereas that for

230

folate is not saturated. To quantitatively understand this, we fitted each curve using a

231

saturating function formulated in equation (1) (see Methods for details). The fitted

232

parameters of equation (1) were as follows; for vitB1, a = 0.186 and b = 0.074; for

233

vitB12, a = 0.099 and b = 0.156; and for folate, a = 0.291 and b = 0.123. By using these

234

parameter values and extrapolating the curve, we then computed how many additional

235

samples are necessary to reach almost maximum performances. To reach 99% of the

236

maximum performance (i.e. Y = (a + 0.5) × 0.99 in equation (1)), the training dataset to

237

be collected was 92.5%, 143%, and 341% of the training size in this study for vitB1,

238

vitB12, and folate, respectively. These quantitative analyses revealed that collecting

239

further similar datasets up to 1,000 patients (e.g. four years × hospitals with similar

240

scale as Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center) may increase and reproduce the

241

generalizability for folate, while the effect of collecting further dataset is expected to be

242
243

small for vitB1 and vitB12.

4. Discussion

245

4.1. Relevance of the present study

246

Based on the largest cohort to date of patients at imminent risk of seriously

247

harming themselves or others, this study indicated that deficiency of certain vitamins

248

can be predicted in an efficient manner via machine-learning using routine blood test

249

results. The 29 routine blood variables are available at almost all hospitals/clinics and

250

are necessary to rule out other comorbid physical problems. Given the large number of

251

patients with vitamin B deficiencies, empirical therapy might be acceptable; however,

252

risk stratification is preferred for personalized medicine and shared decision-making.

253

The prediction method presented here may expedite clinical decision-making as to

254

whether vitamins should be prescribed to a patient (Graphical abstract is shown in

255

Figure 5).

256

Remarkably, the AUC of folate deficiency was 0.796. The robustness of folate

257

prediction was also suggested by various independent methods and statistics. Folate has

258

a potential to maintain neuronal integrity and is one of the homocysteine-reducing

259

B-vitamins5. Homocysteine may be linked to the etiology of schizophrenia18, and

260

vitamin B supplements have been reported to reduce psychiatric symptoms significantly

261

in patients with schizophrenia7. A recent meta-review has pointed out that the

262

bioactivity of the supplement should be considered (e.g. methylfolate, which

263

successfully crosses the blood-brain barrier, has been reported effective, whereas the

264

effect of other forms of folate is equivocal)19. As our study does not present longitudinal

265

clinical courses, an intervention effect of folate supplementation to the cohort based on

266

our method remains to be clarified.

267
268
269
270

4.2. Biological mechanism prediction
To connect with biological knowledge, we compared four models with high
interpretability in this study. Using the random forest classifiers, as shown in Figure 3,

271

we identified several items related to complete blood count as top hits. Notably, our

272

classifier was blind to any biological knowledge, including the well-established

273

association between anemia and vitamin B deficiency, including folate20. The results

274

provide further evidence of a relationship between vitamin B levels and the complete

275

blood count and support the use of machine-learning to investigate novel, underlying

276

biological mechanisms21.

277

ALP and its metabolites indicate the vitamin B6 status22; low vitB12 is

278

potentially associated with low ALP23. More generally, ALP may have a close and

279

complicated relationship with the overall vitamin B group. Autoimmune disorders,

280

especially thyroid disease, are commonly associated with pernicious anaemia24, but

281

there has been no established hypothesis regarding the causal relationships between

282

thyroid disease and vitamin B deficiencies. The potential association between the levels

283

of these vitamins and ALP or TSH awaits further study, both via investigations of

284

populations and basic research25.

285
286
287

4.3. Limitations
This study is subject to several limitations. First, the findings of this

288

single-center retrospective study may have limited external generalizability, though

289

internal generalizability was considered to the maximum extent. Second, the patients’

290

basic characteristics and long-term prognosis were not fully investigated due to

291

administrative restrictions. Though there is similar involuntary treatment/admission in

292

psychiatry worldwide, there is a gap between legislation and practice26. Therefore, the

293

extent to which this method can expedite clinical decision-making is unclear.

294

Further, we did not investigate the relationship between serological values and

295

the need for intervention. The lack of data for vitamin B deficiency in the Japanese

296

general population hampered the comparison between the experimental cohort and their

counterparts who lacked psychiatric symptoms. Establishing appropriate reference

298

values and an assessment method requires further investigation. Finally, we did not

299

assess the predictive value of other nutritional impairments, including vitamin B6 and

300

homocysteine deficiency, which were previously shown to have a close link with

301

psychiatric symptoms3,5; however, our study provides fundamental data on nutritional

302

impairment based on the largest cohort of patients with intense psychiatric episode ever

303

assembled for this purpose and presents a potential framework for predicting nutritional

304

impairment using machine-learning.

305
306
307

4.4. Conclusion
The present report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that

308

machine-learning can efficiently predict nutritional impairment. This study also

309

provided the possible application of machine-learning to investigate novel, underlying

310

biological mechanisms. Further research is needed to validate the external

311

generalizability of the findings in other clinical situations and clarify whether

312

interventions based on this method can improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.

5. Contribution to the Field Statement
Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric

316

symptoms; however, vitamin B deficiency epidemiology in patients with intense

317

psychiatric symptoms has rarely been examined. Moreover, vitamin deficiency testing

318

is costly and time-consuming. Based on the largest cohort to date of patients at

319

imminent risk of seriously harming themselves or others, this study demonstrated that

320

the deficiency of certain vitamins can be predicted in an efficient manner via

321

machine-learning models from patient characteristics and routine blood test results

322

obtained within one hour.

323

In detail, among the 497 patients investigated (over 60% was diagnosed with

324

schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders), 22.5%, 16.1%, and 14.5% patients had a

325

deficiency of vitamin B1, B12, and folate, respectively, by direct measurement. Further,

326

the machine-learning models well generalized to predict the deficiency in unseen

327

datasets; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the

328

validation dataset were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, respectively. The prediction method

329

presented in this study may expedite risk stratification and clinical decision-making

330

regarding whether replacement therapy should be prescribed. The results also provided

331

further evidence for well-known relationships between these vitamins and the complete

332

blood count and supported the application of machine-learning to investigate novel,

333
334

underlying biological mechanisms.

Generalization performance of the classifiers was evaluated using AUC of the

526

validation set for each type of classifiers. For random forest classifiers, sensitivity,

527

specificity, and accuracy of the classification at the optimal operating points that

528

maximized accuracy on the receiver operating characteristic curve of the validation set

529

are also shown (see also Figure 2 D-F). Accuracy was defined as the average of the

530

sensitivity and specificity. Square brackets indicate the 95% confidence interval. For

531

further information, see Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 5.
