Prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Africa: A systematic review
and meta-analysis

Abstract
Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is a global health care problem and financially costly. Diabetic
peripheral neuropathy is common and frequent cause of morbidity and disability. Despite its
serious complications, limited evidence is available on the magnitude of diabetic peripheral
neuropathy among patient with diabetes mellitus. Hence, the objective of this systematic review
and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy
among patients with diabetes mellitus in Africa.
Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Africa journal online, WHO afro library and
Cochrane review were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed.
Heterogeneity across the included studies was evaluated by inconsistency index (I2). Publication
bias was examined by funnel plot and Egger’s regression test. The random-effect model was
fitted to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes
mellitus patients. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for
windows.
Results: Twenty-three studies which comprises of 269,691 participants were included in the
meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 46% (95%
CI:36.21-55.78%). Based on the subgroup analysis, the highest magnitude of diabetic peripheral
neuropathy was reported in West Africa 49.4% (95% CI: 32.74, 66.06).
Conclusion: This study revealed that the overall prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is
relatively high in Africa. Hence, diabetic peripheral neuropathy needs situation based
intervention and preventive strategy depending on their country context. Furthermore, further
meta-analysis study is needed to identify associated factors for the occurrence of diabetic
peripheral neuropathy.

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is a global health care problem and financially costly. According to
IDF(international diabetic federation) latest estimated data, globally about 425 million adults in
2017 were living with diabetes; by 2045 this will rise to 629 million [1]. Worldwide, diabetes
directly caused 1.6 million deaths in 2015 [2]. Over the past decade, diabetes prevalence has
risen faster in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries [3]. In Africa, by
2017, 39 million were living with diabetes;by 2045 this will increase to 82 million [1]. Diabetes
caused at least 727 billion dollars in health expenditure in 2017, about 12% of total spending on
adults [1].
Morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is attributed to the microvascular and macro-vascular complications [4]. Diabetic Peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is among
micro-vascular complications of diabetes that make patients prone to ulceration and amputation.
DPN is common and frequent cause of morbidity and disability [5]. The Toronto consensus
meeting defined DPN as asymmetrical, length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy attributed
to metabolic, micro vessel alterations as a result of a background long-standing hyperglycaemia
and metabolic derangements[6]. Likewise, diabetic neuropathy leads to change in diabetic nerve
is delayed nerve conduction velocity and the earliest histological change is segmental
demyelination [7].
The prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is varying widely in the literature. This is due
to differences in the diagnostic criteria employed, types of diabetes ,the different methods of
patient selection and the sample size [8, 9]. However, it has been estimated to be 8.4% in china
[10], 48.1% in Sri Lankan[11] , 29.2% in India [12], 56.2% in Yemen [9], 39.5% Jordan [13],
71.1% in Nigeria [14], 16.6% in Ghana [15],and 29.5% in Ethiopia [16].
Owing to the fact that peripheral nerve damage in diabetic patients is mostly irreversible,
prevention of its occurrence has been the focus, and this has led to continued search for
modifiable risk factors [17]. Current studies suggest that risk factors for diabetic peripheral
neuropathy include age, gender, duration of diabetes, the presence micro-vascular complications,
hypertension, residence, body mass index, HbA1c, alcohol intake, hyperglycaemia , cigarette
smoking, level of physical activity and marital status [12, 18-25].

Patients with peripheral neuropathy might suffer from loss or absence of protective sensation in
the lower extremities leading to balance problem[26], risk of foot ulceration[22], pain and
frequently disrupts sleep [27], cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [19], reduced quality of
life [28] ,and increase costs of treatment[29]. According to reports in the literature, appropriate
interventions and screening can reduce ulcers by 60% and amputations by 85% in those with
high-risk diabetic neuropathy[30]. Although most previous studies have been conducted to assess
the magnitude of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic foot ulcer, and diabetic nephropathy the
magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patient with diabetes mellitus remains
unknown. Hence, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the
pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in
Africa. Finding from the current study would serve as benchmark for policy-makers to
implement appropriate preventive measure and to alleviate the pressing problem of diabetic
peripheral neuropathy.

Methods
Search strategy and database
To extract all relevant literature, electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Africa
journal of online, Scopus, Web-science, WHO afro library and Cochrane and other databases
were searched. In addition, a hand search of gray literature and other related articles were
deployed to identify additional relevant research. This search employed articles published from
1st January/ 2000 to 22th August, / 2019. The search was conducted using the following MeSH
and free-text terms: “peripheral neuropathy”, “diabetic neuropathy”, “diabetic polyneuropathy”,
“diabetes mellitus”, and “Africa”. Boolean operators like “AND” and “OR” were used to
combine search terms.

Eligibility criteria
Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) All observational studies, which
reported the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy;(2) articles published in peer reviewed
journals and gray literature:(3) published in the English language between 2000 to 2019;and (4)
studies conducted in Africa. Studies were excluded on any one of the following conditions: (1)
studies which were not fully accessed; (2) studies with duplicated citation;( 3) studies with poor
quality score as per stated criteria;(4) articles in which fail to determine the outcomes (diabetic

peripheral neuropathy);(5) peripheral neuropathy other than diabetes mellitus; and (6) Diabetic
patients presenting with HIV or tuberculosis on treatment or chemotherapy.

Selection and quality assessment
Data were extracted using standardized data extraction format prepared in a Microsoft excel by
three independent authors. The extracted information from the literature included the name of
author’s, year of publication, study area, study design, sample size, data collection year, data
collection method, reported prevalence and its 95% confidence interval. The quality of each
included study was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale [31]. Studies were included in the
analysis if they scored ≥5 out of 10 points in three domains of the equally weighted ten modified
NOS components for cross-sectional study. Likewise, the quality score of each study was
extracted from each incorporated article by three independent authors. Any disagreements at the
time of data abstraction were resolved by discussion and consensus.
Additional file 1: Table S1.Methodological quality assessment of cross-sectional studies using
modified Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS).

Statistical analysis
To obtain the pooled effect size, a meta-analysis using weighted inverse variance random-effects
model was performed. Heterogeneity across the included studies was checked using the chisquare based Q test and the I2 statistics test [32]. The result of Q test was regarded to be
statistically significant at p-value < 0.1. Meta-regression and sub group analyses were performed
to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of
a funnel plot. In addition, Egger test was conducted and a p<0.05was considered statistically
significant for the presence of publication bias [33, 34]. Sensitivity analysis was employed to see
the effect of single study on the overall estimation. The meta-analysis was performed using the
STATA version 14 statistical software for Windows. The result was presented in the form of
table and figures.

Data synthesis and reporting
We analysed the data to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Results were presented using forest plots. The result of this review were reported based on the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline [35].

Result
Search results
Totally, 1,278 studies were retrieved, of which, 1,261 studies were found from six international
databases and the remaining 17 were through manual search. Databases includes; PubMed (161),
Scopus (53), Google scholar (507), WHO afro library (3), Cochrane reviews (7), and Africa
online journal (530). Out of them, 659 duplicate records were identified and removed. From the
remaining 619 articles, 492 articles were excluded after reading of titles and abstracts based on
the pre-defined eligible criteria. Finally, 127 full text articles were assessed for eligibility criteria.
Based on the pre-defined criteria and quality assessment, only 23 articles were included for the
final analysis (Figure 1
Figure 1.PRISMA flow chart of study selection

Baseline characteristic of the included studies
A total of 23 studies with 269,691 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Overall
information regarding the prevalence was obtained from various areas across Africa: 10 studies
from Nigeria [14, 18-20, 22, 36-40], 4 article from Ethiopia[16, 24, 41, 42], 2 studies from
Cameroon[23, 43], 2 article from Sudan[44, 45], 2 research paper from Egypt[46, 47],the
remaining was from Ghana [15],Uganda [48],and Tanzania [49]. The highest prevalence of
diabetic peripheral neuropathy (83.4%) and the lowest (7.5%) were reported from Nigeria. The
studies varied substantially in size, the one having 50 patients, while the other enrolled 524
patients. Moreover, based on modified Newcastle Ottawa quality score assessment all 23 article
fulfil the required quality score (Table 1).

Sub group analysis
In order to validate the presence of significant heterogeneity within and between the primary
studies require the need to conduct subgroup analysis. As a result, in order to ascertaining the
sources of heterogeneity we had deployed sub group analysis by using study area. The finding of
subgroup analysis using study area showed that the highest magnitude of diabetic peripheral
neuropathy was observed a study conduct in West Africa 49.4% (95% CI: 32.74, 66.06) (Figure

Meta- regression analysis
To investigate the possible source of variation across the included studies, we have performed
meta-regression by using publication year, and sample size as covariate of interest. However, the
result of the meta-regression analysis showed that both covariates were not statistically
significant for the presence of heterogeneity (Table 2).

Sensitivity analysis
We have also conducted sensitivity analysis, to evaluate the effect of individual study on the
pooled effect size. The finding of sensitivity analyses using random effects model revealed that
no single study affect the overall magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (figure 5).

Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of diabetic peripheral
nuropathy was 46%. This finding was comparable with the finding from a systematic review and
meta-analysis conducted in Iran, which reported that 53% of the patients with diabetes mellitus
developed diabetic peripheral neuropathy [51].On the other hand, the finding was higher than a
report from a systematic review and meta-analysis in developed countries, which showed that the
prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 35.78% [52]. This variation could be different
diagnostic criteria of diabetic neuropathy, early diagnosis and treatment in the developed
countries.
The studies, which included in this review, had very varied in the prevalence of diabetic
peripheral neuropathy that they reported from 7.5% [40] to 83.4% [22]. The result of the

subgroup analysis based on study area showed that the highest pooled prevalence of diabetic
peripheral neuropathy was observed from studies done in West Africa 49.4% (95% CI: 32.74,
66.06) and the lowest was observed in Central Africa 35.9% (95% CI: 29.51, 42.32). This
diversity could be different diagnostic criteria of diabetic neuropathy, health care service
delivery, duration and severity of diabetes. The findings of this meta-analysis have implications
for clinical practice. Estimating the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy provides
updated evidence to develop prevention strategy, serves as key indicators of patient safety,
reflect the quality of healthcare service, and appropriate management strategy for diabetic
peripheral neuropathy patients.
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted based on PRISMA guideline for
literature reviews. In addition, publication bias was quantified using Egger’s regression statistical
test, and NOS was used to assess the quality of included studies. It has been the first study in
Africa; the evidence could be helpful for future researchers, public health practitioners and
healthcare policy-makers.
Although this meta-analysis conducted with the use of comprehensive search strategy to
incorporate the studies conducted in Africa and all the included studies were observational study.
In addition, the inclusion of all previously published studies is a further strength of this metaanalysis; there are some limitations that need to be considered in the future research. First, only
English articles were considered; Second, this study do not identify the predictors of diabetic
peripheral neuropathy; and Third, all included studies were reported hospital-based data.

Conclusion and recommendations
This study revealed that the overall prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was relatively
high in Africa. Therefore, policymakers and other concerned bodies need to give special
attention to improve health care delivery for patient with diabetes mellitus and reduce the risk of
peripheral neuropathy. Situation based interventions and country context specific effective
preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the burden of peripheral neuropathy among
patients with diabetes mellitus and to improve the overall quality of healthcare service at large.
Likewise, intensive and multifactorial approach is required to combat the diabetic related
complication, which focus on treatment adherence, control of comorbidity, early diagnosis and

Furthermore, further research is needed to identify associated factors for the

development of peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus.
