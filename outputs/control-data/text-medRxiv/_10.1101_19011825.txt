Abstract:
Introduction: Loss of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons represents the earliest AD
lesion in the brain. Research suggests differing functional roles between two EC
subregions, the anterolateral EC (aLEC) and the posteromedial EC (pMEC).
Methods: We use joint label fusion to obtain aLEC and pMEC cortical thickness
measurements from serial MRI scans of 775 ADNI-1 participants (219 healthy; 380 MCI;
176 AD) and use linear mixed-effects models to analyze longitudinal associations
between cortical thickness, disease status and cognitive measures.
Results: Group status is reliability predicted by aLEC thickness, which also exhibits
greater associations with cognitive outcomes than does pMEC thickness. Change in
aLEC thickness is also associated with CSF amyloid and tau levels.
Discussion: Thinning of aLEC is a sensitive structural biomarker that changes over
short durations in the course of AD and tracks disease severity – it is a strong candidate
biomarker for detection of early AD.

Introduction:
Layer II of the entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the earliest sites for the accumulation of
tangle pathology and neurodegeneration in the course of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 1–3.
Quantitative studies of neuron numbers in autopsy brains characterized for AD
pathology have shown that a substantial reduction in EC is observed by the time of
dementia diagnosis and further progressive loss of EC neurons occurs over the course
of the disease 4–6. Little or no neuron loss occurs within EC in healthy aged brains
without AD pathology suggesting that EC neurodegeneration is specific to disease 4.
Histopathological data indicate that the transentorhinal region, which consists of the
anterolateral EC (aLEC) and perirhinal cortex, is vulnerable in the early stages of AD
(Braak Stages I and II [2]). Recent evidence has elucidated a functional subdivision in
the EC whereby the lateral and medial portions are involved in different aspects of
information processing 7 and are differentially connected with the perirhinal and
parahippocampal cortices 8. Other work has shown that the aLEC (which maps onto the
lateral entorhinal cortex in rodents) is selectively vulnerable to age-related alterations in
processing 9 as well as structural changes associated with age-related cognitive decline
10
in contrast to the posteromedial portion (pMEC). While volume reductions in the EC
independently predict the likelihood of conversion from healthy aging to amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to AD 11–13, preceding and predicting
hippocampal volume reduction 14, it is unclear whether these volumetric changes are
primarily driven by the aLEC or the pMEC.
Given the need for improved diagnostic biomarkers that are capable of detecting the
earliest signs of neurodegeneration and the wealth of evidence pointing to the EC as an
early site of structural decline, we seek to determine if we can identify different
trajectories of structural thinning in the aLEC and pMEC in healthy, MCI and AD
individuals.
The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 15) began in 2003 with the goal
of developing imaging, genetic and pathological biomarkers for early detection and
longitudinal progression in AD. This multisite imaging endeavor provides investigators
with open access to serial MRI scans from nondemented individuals as well as MCI and
AD patients, in conjunction with other biomarker data such as CSF amyloid and tau
pathological markers. Measurements of cortical thickness (CT) have recently emerged
as potential candidates for biomarkers due to their superior sensitivity to layer-specific
cortical atrophy compared to volumetric approaches and the availability of automated
methods for estimation 16. In the ADNI sample, EC CT was the most powerful measure
of structural change both in MCI and AD brains 17. EC thinning also preceded and
predicted hippocampal atrophy 18 and predicted conversion to AD with the greatest
accuracy 19.
For EC thinning to be a reliable and robust measurement that accurately reflects
neurodegeneration and supports longitudinal tracking of disease progression, several
common methodological limitations need to be addressed 20. These issues include

Here, we apply a novel pipeline that we recently developed for longitudinal registrationbased CT to quantify aLEC and pMEC thinning that directly addresses these pitfalls and
extend prior findings that EC thickness reliably differentiates normal controls from MCI
patients and MCI patients from AD patients in the ADNI sample. Using linear mixedeffects (LME) models, we quantify cross-sectional and longitudinal associations
between aLEC and pMEC thickness and two cognitive outcomes, the Clinical Dementia
Rating – Memory box score (CDRM) and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), while
controlling for possible confounding variables including age, sex, total brain volume and
APOE ε4 genotype. We supplement this analysis of cognitive outcomes by using further
LME models to establish diagnostic cohort specific trajectories in aLEC and pMEC CT
through time and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to ascertain predictive
value of aLEC and pMEC CT for diagnostic outcomes. In a secondary analysis, we use
an LME model to follow trajectories in aLEC and pMEC CT through time for two subcohorts with differing CSF amyloid profiles.

Raw imaging data and preprocessing
All T1-weighted MPRAGE MRI scans used in this study were drawn from the publicly
available Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Exact parameters for the
sequences acquired are available on http://adni.loni.usc.edu. Due to limited contrast
between EC regions and surrounding areas in T1-weighted MRI, we employ the multiatlas joint label fusion methodology 23 for EC parcellation and subsequent thickness
estimation based on combined T1- and T2-weighted image information from a set of
gold-standard atlases (see below), permitting a more robust weighted consensus
approach than single-template and/or T1-weighted-only alternatives.
Atlas data
We use a set of 17 atlases for multi-atlas joint label fusion comprising T1/T2-weighted
image pairs and corresponding segmentation labels for the following left/right regions
(aLEC, pMEC, perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, DG/CA3, CA1, and
subiculum). Manual atlas labeling uses the T2-weighted image for each atlas set and a
well-established and validated protocol 9. Atlas labels for a single subject are shown in
Supplementary Figure S1 superimposed on the corresponding T2-weighted image.
The scans used to compose the atlases were collected on a Philips 3T scanner at the
University of California, Irvine. T1-weighted MPRAGE scans were acquired in the
sagittal orientation with an isotropic image resolution of 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 mm3. Image
acquisition for the T2-weighted protocol was angled perpendicular to the long axis of the
hippocampus consistent with previous work 24. T2-weighted image resolution is 0.47 x
0.47 x 2.0 mm3. The optimal rigid transformation between each individual atlas’ T1- and

T2-weighted images was determined using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)
software package 25,26.
Population-specific templates
To facilitate aLEC/pMEC thickness estimation for the ADNI cohort described below, two
population-specific, optimal shape/intensity templates were generated. The first T1weighted template was constructed from 52 cognitively normal ADNI-1 subjects for a
separate ADNI-based investigation 27, and we opted to use it in this study since it
provides an intermediate registration space for transforming the labels of the 17 atlases.
The second T1-weighted template, the “UCI” template, was generated from the 17 T1weighted atlas images discussed above28. Representative slices for both templates are
shown in Supplementary Figure S2. ANTs-based Symmetric normalization (SyN) was
used to determine optimal diffeomorphic transformation between the two T1-weighted
templates. This permits the two T1-weighted templates to act as an intermediate
geometric space for the “pseudo-geodesic” mapping 29 between a set of atlas labels and
the individual T1-weighted time point.
Individual time point processing
Processing was conducted using the recently developed ANTs longitudinal structural
processing pipeline 27 which is an extension of the previously reported cross-sectional
framework 30. Briefly, the T1-weighted images constituting the set of subject’s
longitudinal data were used to create a single-subject template (SST) as an unbiased
space for processing longitudinal time points of individual subjects 21. The SST was then
processed through the cross-sectional pipeline using the ADNI-1 template mentioned
earlier. This processing produced the SST auxiliary images (i.e., n-tissue segmentation
priors and brain extraction mask prior) used for individual time point brain extraction and
tissue segmentation into CSF, cortical gray matter, white matter, deep gray matter,
brain stem and cerebellum. Output of this processing stream includes the transforms
between the individual time point and the SST and the transforms between the SST and
the ADNI-1 template. In this way, concatenation of transforms can be used to map each
of the 17 atlas label sets to each individual time point through a set of intermediary
spaces which constitutes the “pseudo-geodesic” transform. This strategy has the benefit
of reducing diffeomorphic distances between registration image pairs, reducing
computational costs in terms of the sheer number of registrations, and taking advantage
of the longitudinal nature of the data. This pseudo-geodesic mapping strategy is
illustrated in Supplementary Figure S3.
Multi-atlas joint label fusion
After mapping the set of 17 atlas label sets to each individual time point, the multi-atlas
joint label fusion23 approach is applied. This technique weights the contribution of each
atlas while minimizing informational redundancy between the atlases. To estimate CT
for each EC region, we base our strategy on the MindBoggle approach31 but, instead of

employing a mesh-based surface area calculation, we opt for the more accurate
Crofton’s formula 32, which estimates the surface area directly.
Statistical analyses
Our primary interest is the linear association between cognitive performance (CDRM
and MMSE), diagnostic status (healthy, MCI and AD) and cortical thickness (CT) in the
aLEC and pMEC. We seek to discern whether declining cognitive performance tracks
with deterioration of CT within the two subregions. We also ask whether clinical
diagnostic groups are separable when viewed through subregion CTs and their
trajectories through time.
Linear mixed-effects (LME) 33 modeling allows us to leverage the longitudinal nature of
the ADNI repeated-measures design insofar as a correctly specified LME model adjusts
for within-subject correlation structure through time. As an extension of the multiple
linear regression framework, LME modeling also supports adjustment for possible
confounding variables as well as inclusion of precision variables. For the primary
analysis, we use three LME models in total, each of which features subject-specific
random intercepts and slopes through time. We decide on the inclusion of random
components using the modified likelihood ratio test34.
With the first two models we wish to understand cognitive performance as a linear
function of CT and its change through time. Both of these models regress either CDRM
or MMSE over aLEC or pMEC CTs (and functions thereof) independently. We fit each
model once for aLEC thickness as predictor of interest and once for pMEC thickness as
predictor of interest since simultaneous inclusion of both measures results in
multicollinearity on account of correlations between subregional CT. The first model
evaluates cognitive score as a function of baseline thickness and the interaction
between baseline thickness and months since baseline. The second model evaluates
cognitive score as a function of baseline thickness and loss of thickness through time.
We stratify the first two models by diagnostic cohort on account of the possibility of
diagnosis based non-linearities in associations through time. Stratification decreases
statistical power but increases model robustness.
Another primary question is whether population CT averages and their trajectories
through time can be separated as a function of healthy, MCI and AD statuses. A third
LME model (Model 3) independently regresses aLEC or pMEC CTs over diagnostic
status and its interaction with months from baseline. We supplement Model 3’s
inferential analysis with a predictive analysis using ROC curves 35 and area under these
curves (AUC) to demonstrate prediction of diagnostic statuses using aLEC or pMEC
thicknesses alone.
Given positive results, we motivate future research by asking the secondary question
whether differential associations between CSF amyloid levels and aLEC/pMEC CTs
provides explanatory power for primary analysis results. Based on prior work 36–39,
Model 4 considers the ratio between p-tau and Aß binarized at the threshold 0.1 as

Results:

We use the R programming language 40 for all statistical analyses. We use the nlme
package 41 for LME model fitting, the ggplot2 package 42 for visualization and the
plotROC package for generating ROC curves 43. For exploratory analyses, we: present
a data table with means, proportions and standard deviations of outcomes and model
covariates stratified by diagnostic cohort; plot aLEC and pMEC thicknesses as a
function of subject age, stratifying by sex; and use nearest neighbor missclassification
as an index of homogeneity.

Data distributions
We provide descriptive statistics for outcomes, predictors and other covariates in Table
1 organized by diagnostic cohort. For each cohort, means and standard deviations
appear for continuous variables and level-wise percent membership appears for factors.
For both baseline aLEC and baseline pMEC cortical thickness, the controls have the
highest values, the AD cohort has the least, and the MCI cohort is in the middle. This
trend holds for the longitudinal change in thickness. The AD cohort has the largest
percent loss per year, and the MCI cohort has less percent loss per year. For both of
these groups the %/yr loss is less for pMEC than it is for aLEC. MMSE and CDRM also
follow the cohort-wise trends: baseline MMSE decreases from control cohort to AD
cohort and baseline CDRM rises. For both MCI and AD cohorts, CDRM changes more
through time than does MMSE.
Figure 1 shows a scatterplot of unadjusted cortical thickness and age across sex and
diagnostic cohort (healthy control and AD). Figure 1a,c shows aLEC thickness in males
and females respectively, while Figure 1b,d shows pMEC thickness in males and
females respectively. Visibly, there is greater overlap between healthy and AD cohort
point clouds as a function of pMEC than as a function of aLEC. We quantify this overlap
using the nearest neighbor misclassification rate as a homogeneity index. Regardless of
sex, cohort clusters exhibit roughly 70% less homogeneity when viewed with aLEC
thickness than with pMEC thickness.

predictive of outcome than is pMEC thickness. Across both outcomes (MMSE and
CDRM), aLEC thickness has 8 significant associations with outcome, whereas pMEC
only has 3 significant associations. In 9 of 12 of the comparisons shown in Table 2
effect sizes are larger for aLEC thickness.
Figure 2 also illustrates Model 2 results, but, to facilitate comparisons across CDRM
and MMSE and aLEC and pMEC thicknesses, axes are standardized. MCI cohort
results are shown in Figure 2b, AD cohort results are shown in Figure 2c. We flipped
the sign of MMSE so that lower scores reflect better testing performance for both
cognitive measures. In general, regression coefficients reflecting the associations
between CDRM or MMSE and aLEC (orange) thickness (and changes thereof) are
more significantly non-zero than those of pMEC (blue) thickness. The scaled
coefficients of aLEC are uniformly higher than pMEC except for the case of MMSE as a
function of % loss CT for the AD cohort. For the MCI cohort, both lower baseline aLEC
thickness and greater % loss aLEC CT predict worse CDRM and MMSE scores.
[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]
EC cortical thickness and clinical diagnosis
Model 3 regresses CT over cohort membership and its interaction with time. In general,
estimated effect sizes for aLEC as a function of cohort membership and time are twice
those for pMEC. Nonetheless, all linear associations are nominally statistically
significant at the 95% confidence level, i.e. none of the intervals contain zero.
The top row of Figure 3 illustrates these results as a function of months from baseline.
aLEC thickness is regressed over cohort membership and months in Figure 3a, pMEC
thickness is regressed over the same in Figure 3b. The three cohorts exhibit greater
separation at baseline when viewed through aLEC thickness than they exhibit when
viewed through pMEC thickness. Estimated aLEC thickness 95% confidence bands
maintain complete separation among cohorts throughout time, whereas estimated
pMEC thickness 95% confidence bands do not.
Figure 4 supplements these inferential results with a predictive analysis using ROC
curves to measure predictive content of aLEC and pMEC CTs with respect to MCI
(Figure 4a) and AD (Figure 4b) status. The aLEC curves are consistently above the
pMEC curves and yield higher AUCs, signifying greater predictive content at every
threshold of the continuous CT values. Both aLEC and pMEC AUCs outperform those
of subject age (MCI 0.47; AD 0.48) and total brain volume (MCI 0.47; AD 0.57).
EC cortical thickness and CSF AD pathology
Given the stronger associations between aLEC CT and clinical outcomes than between
pMEC thickness and the same, we ask whether a stronger link between aLEC thickness
and CSF AD pathology levels exists than between pMEC thickness and the same. This

Discussion

We look at the longitudinal progressions of aLEC and pMEC thicknesses as a function
of the binary threshold given by the ratio of phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau) to amyloid
beta (Aß) being greater than 0.1 36–39. These CSF data are available for a smaller 238
subject (70 healthy; 119 MCI; 49 AD) subset of the data used in the primary analyses.
Due to dearth of repeated measures for CSF levels, we consider only the first CSF
measurement for each individual and only include CT, CDRM and MMSE data collected
during visits occurring after this CSF measurement with one-month grace period.
Proportions of the ratio of p-tau to Aß that are greater than 0.1 are 0.9 for the healthy
cohort, 0.97 for the MCI cohort and 1 for the AD cohort. We refer to these subjects as
being “p-tau/Aß ratio-positive” or “amyloid ratio-positive”.
We model the linear associations between subregion CTs and ratio positivity and its
interaction with time from baseline (as measured by time of CSF measurement). The
bottom row of Figure 3 presents the estimated linear cross-sectional (left) and
longitudinal (right) associations along with 95% confidence intervals. Cross-sectionally,
we estimate that the population of individuals with amyloid ratio positivity has 0.11 mm
less aLEC CT than does the population of individuals who are amyloid ratio negative.
For perspective, 0.11 mm is more than the difference between baseline aLEC thickness
means of healthy control and MCI cohorts presented in Table 1.
Longitudinally, we estimate that the amyloid ratio-positive sample of individuals
experiences an additional loss of 0.025 mm aLEC CT per year compared to the loss
experienced by the amyloid ratio-negative sample. The additional loss in aLEC CT
experienced by the amyloid ratio-positive sample requires 4 years before the difference
between healthy and MCI cohorts is spanned. Due to the smaller sample size in this
analysis, the results require further research and should be regarded as preliminary.

Given the wealth of research implicating the transentorhinal region1–3, selective
vulnerability of the aLEC to age-related alterations in processing 9 and structural
changes associated with age-related cognitive decline 10, we hypothesized that aLEC
structure, specifically CT, might provide a suitable biomarker for early AD detection. We
implemented a novel longitudinal CT pipeline on structural MRI data collected from the
ADNI-1 cohort and compared this data with MMSE and CDRM performance, diagnostic
cohort membership and CSF amyloid levels. Initial homogeneity analyses showed less
overlap between healthy control and AD cohorts as a function of aLEC CT than for
pMEC CT. We used LME models to analyze linear associations between these
quantities through time while controlling for within-subject correlations and confounders
such as age, sex, brain volume and APOE ε4 genotype.
Primary analyses showed statistically and practically significant negative associations
between baseline aLEC thickness and progression of cognitive performance over time

(Model 1). We also observed statistically and practically significant associations
between change in aLEC thickness and cognitive performance through time (Model 2).
Cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations between aLEC thickness and cognitive
performance were present for both MCI and AD cohorts. We also tested whether
trajectories of EC subregional CT through time differentiate by clinical diagnostic
grouping (Model 3). aLEC thickness maintained complete separation between 95%
confidence bands between healthy, MCI and AD cohorts while pMEC thickness did not.
Results indicate that the EC subregions could be differentially affected during early
stages of AD. This is consistent with histopathological studies, which have reported that
neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads show a distribution pattern that allow for
staging 3. Initial stages show alterations confined to the transentorhinal region, which
includes the aLEC. These results contribute to growing evidence that the aLEC is
selectively vulnerable during early AD and also demonstrate that aLEC CT and changes
in thickness over time are sensitive to cognitive changes and serve as a viable
biomarker for prodromal AD.
In a secondary analysis, we analyzed the relationship between subregional CT and CSF
measures of amyloid and tau pathology. Clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are
preceded by a long preclinical phase in which pathological protein aggregation occurs in
the brain 6,44. Additionally, Aβ plaques develop ~15-20 years before onset of cognitive
impairment and neurofibrillary tangles begin to accumulate at least 5 years before
symptom onset 44. Previous studies have shown low CSF levels of Aβ strongly correlate
with increased plaque load in the brain, and that high concentrations of CSF ptau
correlate with ADspecific neurofibrillary pathology 45,46. Furthermore, ptau181-Aβ42 ratio
(ptau181/Aβ42) has been shown to be a strong predictor of conversion from cognitively
normal to mild cognitive impairment over a 3~4 year period 36–38.
We found statistically and practically significant linear associations between the
binarized ratio p-tau/ Aβ >0.1 and aLEC CT and estimated that there are similar
differences in aLEC CT levels comparing the p-tau/ Aβ ratio-positive sample to the
ratio-negative sample as for the comparison between the MCI cohort and the healthy
cohort. Furthermore, the p-tau/ Aβ ratio-positive sample exhibits a statistically and
practically significant change in aLEC thickness over time, requiring an estimated 4
years to span the gap between healthy and MCI cohorts. This secondary analysis
suggests the presence of AD-specific neuropathology may mediate thinning of the
aLEC over time, but results require further investigation.
Overall, these results suggest that aLEC cortical thickness is a sensitive measure to
cognitive decline as well as to AD pathological stage. Considering the growing interest
in surrogate biomarkers that are sensitive and specific to AD especially during the early
stages, we suggest that aLEC thinning may be an early marker that may be associated
with cognitive decline especially in the memory domain and may serve as a mechanistic
link between pathological load and cognitive outcomes. Additional research should
focus on further understanding the function of aLEC and structural trajectories with
aging and disease. For example, the human aLEC appears is involved in tasks ranging

from visual object pattern separation 7,9 to intra-item configural processing 47 to temporal
precision in real-world stimuli 48. Developing tasks that are specific and sensitive to
aLEC (dys)function could serve as an early predictor of cognitive decline. In the future,
these tasks can provide measures that can be used as neurobiologically-validated
outcomes for clinical trials in preclinical AD.

Figure 2. Estimated linear associations and nominal 95% confidence intervals
between anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal (aLEC and pMEC) cortical
thicknesses (CT) and MMSE or CDRM. (a) for AD and MCI cohorts, the first row
contains cross-sectional associations with baseline thickness (CT0) whereas the second
d
and third lines contain longitudinal associations. Cells for which intervals do not contain
zero are green. (b-c) Model 2’s adjusted linear associations between CDRM or MMSE
and aLEC or pMEC baseline thicknesses and percent change in thickness from
baseline. Baseline CT, percent gain CT, MMSE and CDRM are standardized. MMSE is
negated since high performance is a higher score for MMSE but lower for CDRM.
Associations are stronger for aLEC CT than for pMEC CT for both MCI (b) and AD (c),
exhibiting point estimates of greater scale as well as fewer confidence intervals
overlapping zero.

Figure 3. Subregion cortical thickness (CT) progressions through time as
estimated using Model 3 along with 95% confidence bands. Model 3 accounts for
individual variations as well as confounding variables. (a-b) when viewed through aLEC
CT, the diagnostic cohorts exhibit statistically significant separation that persists through
h
the entire time of measurement. Such separation is not apparent in pMEC CT. (c-d)
secondary analysis on subset of ADNI-1 cohort comparing progressions for amyloid
ratio-positive (p-tau/Aß >0.1) and ratio-negative cohorts shows qualitatively different
behavior between aLEC and posteromedial entorhinal (pMEC) CT, suggesting a
possible role for CSF amyloid ratio in influencing aLEC but not pMEC CT trajectory.

Supplementary Methods
S.1. The ADNI dataset
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database
(http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on
Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB),
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5- year public-private partnership. The primary
goal of ADNI (PI: Michael Weiner, UCSF) has been to test whether serial magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological
markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure
the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of
very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new
treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of
clinical trials.
ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic
institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50
sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults,
ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, approximately 200 cognitively normal older
individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years
and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years. A detailed description of the
ADNI population, protocols and biomarkers is provided at http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/.
S.2. Subject selection
The ADNI general eligibility criteria are previously described 49. Normal controls (NC)
have a CDR of 0. Subjects with MCI have a subjective memory complaint, objective
memory loss measured by education-adjusted scores on Wechsler Memory Scale
Logical Memory II, a CDR of 0.5, preserved activities of daily living, and absence of
dementia. Subjects with AD have a CDR of 0.5 or 1.0 and meet NINDS criteria for
probable AD. At the time of download, 300 individuals with MCI and 191 healthy
controls with baseline, 6 months, and 12-month follow-up data were available for
download and were used in the current study. We also randomly selected a sample of
49 AD patients with baseline scans for comparison and to define the parametric space

of EC thickness. Demographics and baseline neuropsychological variables for all three
groups are shown in Table 1. Neuropsychological test data were not available for 4 AD
subjects.
S.3. MRI methods
Detailed methods of MRI acquisition are previously described 50. Only T1-weighted 3D
MP-RAGE scans were used in this report (acquisition parameters: FOV = 240 x 240;
matrix = 192 x 192; TR = 3000 ms; TI = 1000; flip angle = 8 degrees, slice thickness =
1.2 mm; sagittal orientation). All MPRAGE scans underwent quality control procedures,
N3 bias correction and were scaled for gradient drift using phantom data.
S.4. Inferential model building and variable selection
To moderate inflation of type 1 error, we design our statistical models from first
principles and prior to accessing the data. We select model responses and predictors of
interest based on our neuroscientific questions of interest. After this, we decide upon
the inclusion of additional covariates based on whether they might be confounders, i.e.,
variables that might influence both outcome and predictors of interest, or precision
variables, i.e., variables that influence outcome alone. Inclusion of confounders
decreases estimator bias and increases variance, leading to more conservative
intervals. Inclusion of precision variables tightens confidence intervals, increasing
certainty.
With these relationships in mind, we now discuss inclusion rationale. The first two
models regress cognitive indices over CT and functions of CT and time from baseline.
As such, we include months from baseline, clinical diagnosis, the number of APOE 4
alleles, sex, age and total brain volume as potential confounding variables – months
from baseline plausibly modulates CT and cognition scores; as a primary biomarker for
genetic predisposition, APOE allele count certainly associates with cognition and might
associate with CT; when combined with other subject descriptors, sex might modulate
cognitive performance and certainly modulates CT; age certainly modulates both; and
brain volume plausibly modulates both. For Model 3, similar logic applies by exchanging
clinical diagnosis for cognition scores. A difference is that we take months from baseline
to be a precision variable since CT changes with time but diagnosis remains constant
for the cohort we consider.
Importantly, we adjust for all but one potential confounder by inclusion in the regression
models as covariates, with the only exception being diagnostic status for Models 1 and
2. Since diagnostic differences plausibly modify the relationship between cortical
thickness and MMSE/CDRM in complicated, nonlinear ways, we instead stratify the
analysis by diagnosis, fitting the two models to the individual cohorts separately. Such
stratification increases model robustness but decreases power, here expressed as
wider, more conservative confidence intervals. Variables of all models appear in Table
S1.

Supplementary Results
Statistical interpretations for Models 1 and 2
We provide statistical interpretations here as examples. Focusing on the upper left cell
of Figure 2 in which the association between baseline aLEC thickness and MMSE is
presented), the interpretation is that for every additional standard deviation in baseline
aLEC thickness, there is an estimated gain of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.82) MMSE
expected for the AD subjects. For the result in which CDRM is modeled as a function of
the interaction between baseline aLEC cortical thickness and months from baseline
within MCI subjects, our interpretation is that for every additional standard deviation of
baseline aLEC thickness and for each additional month from baseline, there is an
estimated decrease of 0.004 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.006) in CDRM expected for MCI
subjects. Finally, for the estimated linear association between standardized percent loss
aLEC thickness and CDRM for the AD population, our interpretation is that for every
additional standard deviation of percent loss from baseline, there is an estimated
increase in CDRM of 0.053 (95% CI: 0.014, 0.091) expected for AD subjects.
Statistical interpretations for Model 3
Considering aLEC thickness as a function of AD group membership and its interaction
with time, it is estimated that when comparing the AD group to the healthy group, (1) the
AD group has 0.20 mm (95% CI: 0.16, 0.23) lower aLEC thickness expected, all other
covariates being held equal; and (2) the AD group has 0.02 mm (95% CI: 0.01, 0.04)
lower aLEC thickness expected for each additional year from baseline, all other
covariates being held equal. For the MCI group, estimated cross-sectional association
with aLEC thickness is half that of the AD population (0.9 mm; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), but
the estimated longitudinal association is roughly equal to that of the AD population (0.02
mm; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.02).
