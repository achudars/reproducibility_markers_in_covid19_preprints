Abstract
Background: The epidemiology of psychiatric comorbidity in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains
poorly understood. Objective: We aimed to determine the risk of schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder in MS patients. Material and Methods: Retrospective cohort analyses were performed
using an all-England national linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset (1999-2016) and to
determine whether schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are more commonly diagnosed subsequently
in people with MS (n=128,194), and whether MS is more commonly diagnosed subsequently in
people with schizophrenia (n=384,188) or bipolar disorder (n=203,592), than would be expected
when compared with a reference cohort (~15 million people) after adjusting for age and other
factors. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.
Results: Findings were dependent on whether the index and subsequent diagnoses were selected
as the primary reason for hospital admission or were taken from anywhere on the hospital record.
When searching for diagnoses anywhere on the hospital record, there was a significantly elevated
risk of subsequent schizophrenia (aHR 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 1.60) and of
bipolar disorder (aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24) in people with prior-recorded MS and of
subsequent MS in people with prior-recorded schizophrenia (aHR 1.26, 1.15-1.37) or bipolar
disorder (aHR 1.73, 1.57-1.91), but most of these associations were reduced to null when analyses
were confined to diagnoses recorded as the primary reason for admission. Conclusion: Further
research is needed to investigate the potential association between MS and schizophrenia and/or
bipolar disorder as it may shed light on underlying pathophysiology and help identify potential
shared risk factors.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial disease of the central nervous system (CNS)
characterised by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology and progressive neurological
dysfunction. MS is a classical neuroinflammatory disease, which is caused by immune
dysregulation that affects CNS function. Recent insight indicates that similar processes may also
play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and the immune hypothesis in these disorders is
receiving growing interest (1).
MS is associated with many neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, which
even precede MS diagnosis (2) (3). Some reports have suggested a link between MS and
schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder (4).
Several investigators have studied the risk of these conditions in MS patients with no consensus
reached. A Canadian study found higher incidence and prevalence estimates of schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder in a MS population than in a matched non-MS population (5), another Canadian
study reported an association between MS and psychosis (6) and a Danish register-based study
found an increased incidence rate ratio of schizophrenia spectrum disorder in MS patients (7). A
study on paediatric MS, using the English National Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality data,
reported elevated rates of psychotic disorders (RR = 10.76 (2.93-27.63)) (8). However, several
studies found no association between schizophrenia and MS. A study from Taiwan found a nonsignificant increased risk of schizophrenia in patients with MS (9) and another Danish study found
no higher than expected prevalence of MS in individuals with schizophrenia (10). Several studies
comparing the prevalence of bipolar disorder in MS patients to a comparator population found
that bipolar disorder was more common in the MS population (11) (12) (5).
To investigate schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in MS further, we undertook record linkage
studies to determine the risk of these disorders in patients with MS using an English National
linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset.

METHODS

Population and data

A Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset covering the population of England from January
1999 to December 2016 was used. The HES data were provided by the NHS Digital (formerly the
English national Health and Social Care Information Centre). The Office for National Statistics
(ONS) collected data on death registrations in the same time period, which were also supplied to
us by NHS Digital. The dataset used in this study, in which successive records for each individual
were linked together using personal identifiers irreversibly encrypted by NHS Digital, was
constructed by the Oxford record linkage group. (13) Approval for a programme of work covering
the construction and analysis of the linked dataset was given by the Central and South Bristol
Research Ethics Committee (ref 04/Q2006/176) and has been updated annually.

Study Design
Retrospective cohort analyses were performed, similar to previous analyses we have undertaken
(14) (15). We constructed a cohort of people diagnosed with MS (International Classification of
Diseases, Revision 10 (ICD-10) code G35), by identifying the earliest known record of day case
care, or inpatient admission, in the dataset for the condition recorded in any diagnostic position in
an NHS hospital during the study period. We then searched the database for any subsequent NHS
hospital care for, or death from, schizophrenia or bipolar in these cohorts. The ICD codes used to
identify schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were, respectively, F20-F29 and F30-31 (10th revision
of the ICD). We then repeated the analyses confining the selection criteria to specify that the
selected diagnoses were recorded as the main diagnostic reason for the hospital admission. For
comparison, a reference cohort was constructed by identifying the earliest known admission for

each individual with various other, mainly minor medical and surgical conditions and injuries
(appendicectomy, squint, otitis externa, otitis media, haemorrhoids, deflected nasal septum, nasal
polyp, impacted tooth and other disorders of teeth, inguinal hernia, in-growing toenail and other
diseases of nail, sebaceous cyst, internal derangement of knee, bunion, contraceptive
management, cataract, dilation and curettage, selected limb fractures, hip/knee replacement, upper
respiratory tract infections, varicose veins). People were included in the MS or reference cohort if
they did not have a record of schizophrenia or bipolar either before or at the same time as the first
record of MS or the reference condition. We also looked to see if associations were present in the
other direction chronologically i.e. whether hospitalisation for MS was increased after
hospitalisation for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Statistical methods
Taking the example of schizophrenia after MS, we used Cox proportional hazards methods to
calculate hazard ratios in order to compare the incidence of schizophrenia in the MS cohort with
the reference cohort after adjustment for age (in five-year age groups), sex, calendar year of first
recorded admission, region of residence, quintile of patientsâ€™ Index of Deprivation score (as a
measure of socio-economic status), and total number of hospital admissions (excluding those that
contained the outcome diagnosis i.e. in this example schizophrenia). Entry to the cohort was the
index date of first known hospital admission for MS (or any one of the reference conditions). Exit
was earliest known date of hospital-recorded schizophrenia, or date of death, or 31 Dec 2017
(whichever occurred first).
We further subdivided the outcomes into people whose earliest known schizophrenia record was
less than one year after the earliest known record of MS, and people whose earliest known
schizophrenia record was more than one year after the earliest known record of MS. Our

reasoning in doing so was to reduce the possibility of including some short-term associations that
might have resulted from misdiagnosis of one condition for the other.

RESULTS
There were 128,194 people in the MS cohort (65,510 with the condition recorded as primary
diagnosis), 384,188 people in the schizophrenia cohort (227,807 as primary diagnosis), and
203,592 people in the bipolar disorder cohort (94,372 as primary diagnosis). There were
15,049,357 people in the reference cohort.

For each analysis, observed numbers of people with each disease outcome and adjusted hazard
ratios are reported in the Table.

Risk of schizophrenia (primary or subsidiary diagnosis)
There was a significantly elevated hazard ratio for schizophrenia after hospital admission for MS
(aHR= 1.51, 95% CI 1.40-1.62), both within a year (aHR= 1.75, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.10) and more
than a year after hospital admission for MS (aHR= 1.47, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.59). The hazard ratio
for MS after hospital admission for schizophrenia was also significantly increased but, overall,
lower in magnitude than that seen for schizophrenia after MS (aHR= 1.26, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37).

Risk of bipolar disorder (primary or subsidiary diagnosis)
There was a modest but significantly increased hazard ratio for bipolar disorder after hospital
admission for MS (aHR= 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24), which reduced when looking more than a
year after hospital admission for MS (aHR= 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16). The hazard ratio for MS
after hospital admission for bipolar disorder was significantly increased (aHR= 1.73, 95% CI 1.57

to 1.91) and persisted when excluding patients first admitted with MS within 1 year of first
admission with MS (aHR= 1.65, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.84).

Restriction of analyses to diagnoses recorded as the main reason for admission
This restriction attenuated the estimates of risk towards null. Most dropped below the 5% level of
statistical significance. The association between prior bipolar disorder and subsequent multiple
sclerosis remained significant, at a time interval of at least a year after first bipolar admission,
with HR= 1.29 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.60).

DISCUSSION
Main findings
We analysed records from an English national dataset of linked Hospital Statistics and mortality
statistics and found that people admitted to hospital with MS coded anywhere on the hospital
record had a significantly increased subsequent rate of occurrence of schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder coded anywhere on the record. When we reversed the chronological sequence of the
diseases, in the equivalent analysis of diagnoses coded anywhere on the record, we found that the
risk of MS after a hospital admission for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder was also significantly
increased. Most of the associations reported were no longer significant when the diagnoses were
restricted to the main reasons for hospital admission, i.e. omitting diagnoses recorded as
incidental.
Comparisons with other studies
Taking the diagnoses from anywhere on the hospital record, the observed increased risk of
schizophrenia in MS patients is in line with a Danish study, which found an increased risk
(RR=1.44, 95% CI 1.03-1.94) (7). A recent Taiwanese study reported a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.21

(95% CI 0.52-9.34) for schizophrenia after MS, similar to our rate ratio of 2.08, but the Taiwan
finding was not statistically significant (9).
Taking the diagnoses from anywhere on the hospital record, we also found an increased risk of
MS after a hospital admission for schizophrenia. A previous Danish study also reported an
elevated incidence rate for MS in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (RR= 1.57, 95%
CI 1.29-1.90); however, in this study the incidence stayed increased five or more years after onset
of schizophrenia (RR= 1.53, 95% CI 1.18-1.95) (16). On the contrary, a Swedish study found an
inverse association with a decreased risk of MS in patients with schizophrenia (HR= 0.6, 95% CI
0.4-0.9) (17).
Again taking the diagnoses from anywhere on the hospital record, our study also found an
increased risk of bipolar disorder in patients with MS, and an increased risk of MS in patients with
bipolar disorder, findings which are in line with a Canadian study which observed an increased
risk of incident bipolar disorder in patients with MS (HR= 2.67, 95% CI 2.29-3.11) (11), and a
Swedish study which observed an increased risk of MS in patients with bipolar disorder (HR= 1.8,
95% CI 1.6-2.2) (17). In our study, the increased risk of MS in patients with bipolar disorder
remained when the analyses were restricted to diagnoses recorded as the main reason for the
hospital admissions.
Interpretation
The associations in our study between MS, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were sensitive to
whether or not the diseases were searched for as the primary reason for hospital admission, and as
such may only cautiously be interpreted as evidence of disease mechanisms shared by these
conditions. MS is a classical neuroinflammatory disease, however, recent evidence highlights that
similar processes such as microglial activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecular mimicry
between pathogens and brain antigens, anti-neuronal antibodies, self-reactive T-cells and

disturbances of the blood-brain barrier are involved in psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder (1). Other possible explanations include shared unmeasured confounders and
the possibility of surveillance bias. On confounders, we took account of age, sex, deprivation, and
other factors described in Methods; but the possibility exists of other confounders not available in
the dataset. Furthermore, surveillance bias could be a factor: if patients with, say, MS are under
continuing medical care, this may lead to a higher probability than that in controls (i.e. in the
reference cohort) that they might be diagnosed and hospitalised with, say, schizophrenia. The fact
that the associations were most evident when incidental diagnoses were included supports the
possibility of a surveillance effect.
Strength and limitations
The strength of the study includes the use of a large, national population based dataset. However,
we were wholly dependent on the reliability of the coded diagnostic data in the dataset. The
associations may also be overestimated because any bias of association may be driven by severe
presentation as it is based on hospital records. Treatment may also complicate the findings and
was not taken into account. For example, we are aware that steroid treatment, which is often used
to treat a MS relapse, can induce psychosis. In all, our findings should therefore be regarded as
preliminary and hypothesis generating rather than definitive.
Conclusions
People admitted to hospital with MS may be at an increased risk of schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder and patients admitted to hospital with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia may be at an
increased risk of MS. Clinicians treating patients with these conditions should be aware of these
possible co-occurring morbidities. However, there are some inconsistencies in our findings which
we describe but cannot fully explain. The findings should be regarded as indicating possible
