Macro-parasite transmission in dynamic
seasonal environment: Basic Reproductive
Number, endemicity, and control
Q. Huang, D. Gurarie, M. Ndeffo-Mbah, N.C. Lo, CH. King

Abstract
Seasonality of transmission environment, which includes snail populations and habitats, or human-snail
contact patterns, can affect the dynamics of schistosomiasis infection, and control outcomes.
Conventional modeling approaches often ignore or oversimplify it by applying ‘seasonal mean’
formulation. Mathematically, such ‘averaging’ is justified when model outputs/quantities of interest
depend linearly on input variables. That is not generally the case for macroparasite transmission models,
where model outputs are nonlinear functions of seasonality fashion.
Another commonly used approach for Schistosomiasis modeling is a reduction of coupled human-snail
system to a single ’human equation’, via quasi-stationary snail (intermediate host) dynamics. The basic
questions arising from these approaches are whether such ‘seasonal averaging’ and ‘intermediate host
reduction’ are suitable for highly variable/seasonal environments, and what implications these methods
have on models’ predictive potential of control interventions.
Here we address these questions by using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical
simulation of two commonly used models for macroparasite transmission, MacDonald (MWB), and
stratified worm burden (SWB) snail-human systems. We showed that predictions from ‘seasonal
averaging’ models can depart significantly from those of quasi-stationary models. Typically, seasonality
would lower endemicity and sustained infection, vs. stationary system with comparable transmission
inputs. Furthermore, discrepancies between the two models (‘seasonal’ and its ‘stationary mean’)
increase with amplitude (or variance) of seasonality. So sufficiently high variability can render infection
unsustainable. Similar discrepancies were observed between coupled and reduced ’single host’ models,
with reduced model overpredicting sustained endemicity. Seasonal variability of transmission raises the
question of optimal control timing. Using dynamic simulation, we show that optimal timing of repeated
MDA is about half season past the snail peak, where snail population attains its minimal value.
Compared to sub-optimal timing, such strategy can reduce human worm burden by factor 2 after 5-6

rounds of MDA. We also extended our models for dynamic snail populations, which allowed us to study
the effect of repeated molluscicide, or combined strategy (MDA + molluscicide). The optimal time for
molluscicide alone is the end or the start of season, and combined strategy can give additional
reduction, and in some cases lead to elimination.
Overall, reduced sustainability in seasonal environment makes it more amenable to control
interventions, compared to stationary environment.

Introduction
Seasonal transmission of an infectious disease is a common phenomenon, defined by time dependent
transmission rates that vary over the season. Schistosomiasis is a case example where the seasonality is
related to snail populations linked to weather patterns (rainfall, temperature), and/or behavioral factors
(human-snail contacts). But mathematical models of Schistosome transmission rarely account for
seasonality, with implication to accuracy of model prediction and opportunity to gain insight into public
health practice, like optimal timing of interventions.
Basic reproduction number ( R0 ) is a fundamental concept widely used in population biology and
infectious disease modeling. In the context of infectious diseases,

R0 is used to assess the magnitude of

disease outbreak, spread or endemic (equilibrium) level [1 ]. Its applications range from modeling of
human-to-human communicable diseases to vector-mediated systems for macroparasite diseases, such
as Ross-MacDonald models of schistosomiasis (see e.g. 2, 3, 4,5,6). Though

R0

was first explicitly derived

for simple single population models, this concept was further extended to more complex metapopulation systems, e.g. spatially connected environment with multiple host sites (see e.g. 7, 8,9, 10,11).
Mathematically,

R0

is most appropriate for stationary environment where disease transmission

parameters are kept fixed. However, in many cases, such environment is highly variable, e.g. seasonal
change of vector population or contact patterns, as well as abrupt changes caused by control
interventions.
One way to incorporate such variability in mathematical models is through appropriate ‘seasonal
averaging’ of environment and/or behavioral inputs. However, little effort was spent to assess the effect
of ‘seasonal averaging’ for analysis of disease predictions, and control outcomes. In general, the use of
averaging methods in non-stationary dynamical systems can be justified when variability is marginal

relative to baseline mean state or when quantities of interest (e.g. dynamic variables or outputs) depend
linearly on variable inputs. Under such conditions, the ‘averaged’ stationary model with properly
adjusted coefficients is able to reproduce approximate ‘mean’ behavior of the non-stationary (time
periodic) system. However, neither of these conditions holds for nonlinear disease transmission models
in variable seasonal environment. The outputs of such system are nonlinear functions of its input
variables, and they can depart significantly from the expected ‘mean’ behavior.
Besides seasonal averaging, another commonly used approximation in modeling vector-host
transmission is a reduction of the coupled system to a single host equation, via quasi-equilibration of
fast vector variables. Such reduction is commonly justified by distinct time scales: slow ‘host-parasite
dynamics’ vs. fast ‘vector-intermediate host’. Indeed, in the context of schistosomiasis time scales for
snail dynamics vary from weeks-to-months, while human and worm scales are order of magnitude
slower (years).
Reduced models are convenient for theoretical analysis and for numeric simulations (see e.g. 2 , 3). Such
reduction procedures however, require more careful analysis beyond simple ‘time-scale’ heuristics, to
assess possible departure of the reduced or averaged models (‘single-host’ or ‘seasonal-mean’) from
their fully coupled, non-stationary precursor.
Here we assess the effect of seasonal averaging and intermediate host reduction for schistosomiasis
transmission in seasonal environment, and their implications on predicting control outcomes (MDA). On
human side, we shall mostly use mean worm burden (MWB) MacDonald formulation (4, 5-7), but make a
few comment on other possible approaches, like stratified worm burden system (8-10). Seasonal
transmission environment can appear as variable snail population and/or variable human-snail contacts.
In this paper, we mainly focus on seasonal snail variability (their population density) that determines
their infection level, and snail-to-human transmission rate. Mathematically, different functions can be
used to account for variable snail population, under different environmental conditions(precipitation,
temperature, et al) (see e.g. 11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16). The two commonly observed patterns include: (i)
moderate snail variability about ‘mean value’ with approximately equal high and low seasons, (ii) long
dry season (with low / zero snail density and transmission) followed by short rainy season, with bursting
snail population and intensified transmission rate.
We shall employ two mathematical functions for such seasonal patterns, namely (i) trigonometric
function 1 + a cos ( 2π t ) with amplitude 0 < a < 1 , for alternating high/low seasons of equal duration, (ii)

concentrated peak density over low-level background with prescribed seasonal mean value =1. The
latter also have a version of amplitude parameter ( 0 < a < 1 ), but its meaning and implication are
different.
Earlier theoretical papers (17,18) studied seasonally varying (periodic) human-snail contact patterns and
their impact on schistosomiasis endemic state and persistence. In particular, 18 estimated endemicity
thresholds for periodically varying MacDonald system. Here we change the focus from ‘seasonal contact’
to ‘seasonal snail population’, and extend the scope of their analysis by exploring the implications of
seasonality for sustained infection, and control interventions, MDA and molluscicide.
The bulk of our analysis employs prescribed snail population (density) function N ( t ) . The study of
molluscicide control however, requires a dynamic snail population that could respond to an abrupt
change, environmental and/or human-made interventions. Such resource-driven models of snail
population biology were developed in several papers (e.g. 15, 16 , 19). These works however, did not apply
dynamic snail models for transmission/control analysis. Our paper attempts to fill this gap. Alongside
prescribed function N ( t ) we develop model of resource driven seasonal snail, and apply it to study
molluscicide.
Two basic parameters employed in our analysis are basic reproduction number

R0

(of ‘mean’

stationary system), and amplitude (a) of seasonal variability.
By combining mathematical analysis with numeric simulations, we address several questions:
(i)

combined effect of ( R0 , a ) on periodic/stationary patterns of human-snail infection and
their seasonal means. Among other results we identified parameter ranges where
transmission becomes unsustainable for different types of seasonality.

(ii)

We explore long terms effect of repeated MDA in different model formulations. Once again,
‘reduced’ and ‘seasonal-mean’ MacDonald system can depart significantly from compete
(fully coupled) dynamical system.

We apply our model to study optimal seasonal timing of repeated interventions MDA, molluscicide,
or integrated strategies, that would achieve maximal parasite burden reduction over limited timespan (6-10 years). For MDA alone, we estimated optimal seasonal timing in the range ¼ - ½ season
past snail peak. Optimal effect of molluscicide on worm reduction is achieved at the end or start of

optimal timing of each intervention, to achieve best results.

for MDA control, explained below.

Seasonal environment
Non-stationary transmission dynamics can arise from multiple sources, including natural (seasonal
snail populations), behavioral (human-snail exposure/contamination), or repeated interventions, like
MDA or molluscicide. In this section we focus on variable snail population, given by function N(t) (see
e.g. 19, 15). There are different types of snail environment, that make time dependent snail population

N ( t ) . We do not attempt to classify and study all such patterns of natural variability, but confine our
analysis to 2 typical periodic functions
I.

Trigonometric: N ( t , a ) = 1 + a cos ( 2π t ) of amplitude 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 , whereby season is evenly divided
between high / low snail density (above and below-average).

Periodic CC-function K ( t , a ) is taken as trigonometric (type I), peak (type II). Equation (1.9) has stable
periodic solution N ( t , a ) , which plays the role of the above prescribed type I-II N. We further assume
snail infection has marginal effect on its growth/ mortality (due to small patency conversion fraction of
snails). So equation (1.9) (variable N ) is decoupled from transmission dynamics (1.7), (1.8), and can be
used as input for MacDonald system.

Typical solution curves K ( t , a ) , N ( t , a ) , y ( t ) for type I-II seasonality are shown in Supplement
(Figure …). While function K ( t , a ) has its peak and trough at t = 0 and t = 1/ 2 (start, middle), N ( t , a )
lags behind (by about .1 of season), followed by y ( t ) . We also note that seasonal mean values N ( a ) are
now reduced ( N < 1 ), and their

R0

(for comparison with prescribed N- case) must be adjusted

accordingly.

Results
Seasonal variability and sustained infection
While stationary systems (1.2)- (1.3) allow direct analysis of equilibrium states via

R0 , non-stationary

systems like (1.7)-(1.8) require numeric simulations. Here we examine the question of seasonal
averaging, and single-host reduction for simple MacDonald system, via comparison of (1.2)-(1.7) vs. (1.3)
-(1.8). Most results below involve periodic (endemic) equilibria w ( t , a ) , and their seasonal mean
*

w ( a ) = w* ( t , a ) . We list a few key results of our analysis (further details can be found in
Supplement).
i)

Stationary full (host-vector) and reduced (single host) MacDonald systems share the same
equilibria and

R0 , but when perturbed from equilibrium (e.g. via MDA) their relaxation patterns

to equilibrium differ, with reduced system relaxing faster (Supplement Figure A). Higher
relaxation rate (rebound) would imply less efficient MDA control in reduced system compared
to full MacDonald host-vector system.

solutions w ( t , a ) , y ( t , a ) , see Figure 2 (more details shown in Supplement Figure C for
trigonometric N, and Figure D for peak-type N.)
iii)

Seasonal-mean values w ( a, R0 ) is a decreasing function of a , with maximum at the stationary
endemic state ( a = 0 ), where

w = 1 − 1/ R0 . Depending on R0

the drop can become

significant for high seasonality ( a ≈ 1 ), up to 40% reduction. Reduced (single-host) model
maintains similar qualitative patterns (loss of w ( a ) with a), but its sustained levels and
seasonal means are higher, than the full MacDonald system (Figure 2(a)- Figure 3(a)).
iv)

Seasonal variability, around its mean value, is relatively low for the worm burden w ( t ) (<5%),
*

but attains much higher levels for infected snail density y ( t ) . Peak worm burden w ( t ) lags
*

*

behind peak snail density N ( t ) (and infected density y ( t ) ) by about one quarter of a season.
v)

Figure 2(b) and Figure 3(b) show similar features for type –II function N ( t ) , in terms of its
amplitude parameter a. Increased a (localized wet season) would lower periodic equilibria. As
above, we observe marked difference between periodic patterns of reduced vs. complete
MacDonald system (see Supplement Figure D). Their seasonal mean functions w ( a, R0 ) also
depart significantly, particularly at large a, with complete 2D MacDonald predicting elimination
at sufficiently high a (solid curves), while reduced model maintaining ‘positive’ endemic value
for all a (dashed curves).

vi)

We further extended this analysis by scanning the ( a, R0 ) - parameter space to select regions
of ‘endemicity’ ( w ( a, R0 ) > 0 ), and ‘elimination’ ( w ( a, R0 ) = 0 ). Thick red curve of Figure 4
marks the boundary between two regions, for trigonometric N ( t , a ) (left), and peak-type
(right).
Overall, we find seasonal snail variability makes infection less sustainable (c.f. 18), and thus

easier to control. The reduced host only system overestimates sustainability and control outcomes for
MacDonald system.

MDA control in stationary environments
Periodic MDA in stationary environment for simple MacDonald system
An MDA session at time T is represented in our setup as instantaneous reduction of mean
burden (due to short drug life-time), w (T ) → ε f w (T ) , where constant ε f combines drug efficacy

(fraction of surviving worms), and population coverage fraction 0 < f < 1

ε f = ε f + (1 − f )
The latter applies to population groups (e.g. worm strata), or the entire community (MacDonald MWB).
One can think of such MDA- event as a sharp spike of worm mortality over short duration. Formally
represented by Dirac delta function.
Each MDA-event is followed by rebound - relaxation towards endemic state (equilibrium, periodic, et al).
Such relaxation patterns can differ in complete (2D) vs. reduced MacDonald (Supplement Figure A). A
regularly spaced sequence of MDA-events creates yet another type of periodic variability in dynamic
system. This time periodicity is affected by worm mortality, rather than snail population growth/decay.
So

γ ( t ) becomes a periodic function with sharp (Dirac delta) spikes, or their finite approximation. As

above, one can ask whether such periodic mortality

γ = γ 1 +

While numerator (1.12) is limited by drug efficacy ( ε f

≤ ε ) even at 100% coverage, its denominator

could be made arbitrarily small by sufficiently frequent MDA sessions (small T).
To test the validity of MDA averaging, we run numeric simulations of two model, periodic MDA,
and its ‘average model” with enhanced worm mortality (1.10). The results (Supplement Figure E) show
elimination path for the mean-MDA system, predicted by

Ref < 1 , while the exact MDA-response curve

is locked in a periodic (limit) cycle pattern, even above critical frequency ( T < Tc ). Such limit-cycle
response patterns arise in many transmission models, including SWB (see

23

), they can frustrate target

reduction goals via repeated MDA regimen (see 24).

Parameter space analysis for MacDonald system with mating.
Unlike simple MacDonald system (Box 1) with unstable-stable pair of equilibria (‘zero –
endemic’), the mated system is bistable, for sufficiently high R0

> Rc . Specifically, it has ‘zero’ and

‘endemic’ states (both stable), plus intermediate breakpoint (saddle) (Supplement Figure F). For detailed
explanation, see ( 1, 9). Another important feature of mated MacDonald system, shared by SWB 9, is their

 A B
,  , rather than single
γ ν 

dependence on two dimensionless parameters, e.g. 

R0

- their product.

The bistable nature (breakpoint) of mated MacDonald system has implications for MDA control.
One such implication concerns regions in the (A, B) –parameter space which separate ‘endemic’ bistable
state from ‘zero infection’. These regions deviate from isocontours of R0 , so to predict elimination one
needs two parameters (A,B), rather than single

R0 (for details see Supplement Figure F, and 9).

Even more stark departures arise for dynamic MDA simulations. Here we can use stationary
transmission environment, but vary transmission coefficients. The results (Supplement Figure G) show
large diversity of outcomes, depending on transmission coefficients (A, B), proportional to population
densities ( A ∝ N - snail,

B ∝ H - human). Different ‘snail per human’ ratios (A/B) correspond to

different transmission environments (population densities), and under identical

R0

they can produce

different outcomes (Supplement Figure G). In some cases (lower ‘snail/human’ ratio), it goes to
elimination after finite number of MDA cycles (though total duration could vary). In other cases (high
‘human/snail’ ratio), the system is locked in a limit cycle, due to post-MDA rebound.

We also observe a discrepancy between predictions of the reduced and complete MacDonald systems.
Typically, reduced model would under-predict the MDA response, and show stronger rebound
(Supplement Figure G).
The key conclusions are (i) conventional

R0

has little predictive value for endemic equilibrium analysis

of mated MacDonald system (zero-to-endemic transition) ; (ii) reduced model (via snail quasi-equilibria)
can grossly underestimate MDA responses; (iii) different choices of dimensionless (A,B) transmission
coefficients that make up

R0

correspond to different snail-to- human abundance. High A (or ratio

N / H ) produce stronger post-MDA rebound, and compound time and effort required for elimination.
Similar effect of snail environment on MDA outcomes was observed and studied for SWB transmission
models (23,25,26). As with MacDonald systems, large snail-to-human ratio was shown to reduce the
efficacy of repeated MDA. So near-identical host communities in terms of baseline infection, could
produce vastly different MDA outcomes depending on snail environment (hot-spots vs. good
responders).26

Optimal MDA timing for seasonal transmission environment.
In this analysis we used seasonal MacDonald system (1.7) with two types of seasonal N ( t ) . In each

{

}

case we computed its endemic periodic state w* ( t ) , y * ( t ) , and run 6-year annual MDA with
combined efficacy parameter

ε M= (1- f ) + ε f = .4 ,

ε .15 − .25 )
corresponding to drug efficacy (=

and coverage fraction ( f ≈ 0.75 ). For both types of seasonality N ( t , a ) we took

=
R0 6;=
a .95 (close

to maximal amplitude).
The upper panels of Figure 5 compare MDA histories of seasonal N ( t ) vs. its stationary (seasonalmean) counterpart. Both systems were treated at the season start ( τ = 1, 2,... ). In both cases, MDA
outcomes (seasonal vs. mean stationary) appear close in terms of dynamic variable w ( t ) , and its
seasonal mean (Figure 5), over 6-year history.
However, different seasonal timing τ of MDA can produce marked differences between stationary and
non-stationary models. Upper panels of Figure 6 demonstrate this effect by comparing MDA histories of

τ = 0 (season start) vs. τ = .5 (middle). It raises the question of optimal choice of MDA timing, to
achieve maximal burden reduction by the end of the program (Y6).

To this end, we run multiple simulations with different choices ( 0 < τ < 1 ), relative to snail peak ( τ = 0
). In each case, we estimated mean effect of a given τ - strategy, by averaging over the proper time
interval

[τ ,τ + 1] .

Figure 6 shows the results (mean w – values) over 6-year control history for different choices of time
shift τ . We find overall effect of τ could be significant between ‘best’ and ‘worst’ timing, up to 40%
improvement (Y6 over Y1) for trigonometric N and to 50% - for peak N. In both cases, we took high
amplitude seasonality ( a = 0.95 ). We observe the optimal timing τ is between one quarter and halfseason for type I, and close to a quarter for type II. Here season start is identified with peak snail
population. The results are summarized in Table 2, for each τ we compute w (Y6 ,τ ) / w (Y0 ) - endemic.

Optimal timing for molluscicide and integrated strategies
Molluscicide is considered a viable option for control of schistosomiasis 27. In this section we explore
optimal timing for snail control (molluscicide), and integrated strategy (MDA + molluscicide), using
logistic snail model (1.9) coupled to MacDonald system (1.7).
Snail control (molluscicide) is implemented similar to MDA, as instantaneous event, whereby dynamic

{

}

variables N ( t ) , y ( t ) are reduced by snail survival fraction ( 0 < ε S

< 1 ) – the efficacy of molluscicide,

and implementation time τ ,

N (τ ) → ε S N (τ ) ; y (τ ) → ε S y (τ )
We run control simulations for both types of seasonality with large amplitude factor, a = .9 (type I), and

a = .6 (type II). In all cases, snail mortality and maximal growth were fixed at ν = 4 /year, β = 20 /year,
consistent with estimated parameters 19. We also fixed R0

= 6 , though its effective values (vs. fixed-N

case) are somewhat lower, reduced by factor N = .73 (type I), and N = .67 (type II).

As above we sample several choices of seasonal timing ( 0 ≤ τ < 1 ), and for each τ -strategy compute its
seasonal mean value.
Figure 7 shows typical 6-year histories for integrated control (MDA + molluscicide) for both types of
seasonality, CC-function K ( t , a ) . Two timing choices are compared, suboptimal τ = 0 (blue), and

τ = 0.5 (yellow), close to optimal. In both cases, we took high seasonal variability ( a = 0.9 for type I,
and a = 0.6 for type II). Application of repeated molluscicide rapidly brings snail system to a periodic
pattern (after 1-2 rounds) for function N ( t ) - total population (unaffected by MDA). But infected snail
density y ( t ) approaches zero (due to MDA effect on snail infection).
Next we discuss specifically optimal timing to two types of seasonality. For molluscicide alone the results
are shown in Table 3 (see supplement). The optimal timing (maximal MWB reduction) falls near start of
season ( τ ≈ 0 ) where CC-function K ( t , a ) reaches its maximum. The overall progress=
( w |t

/w |

6=t 1

varies in the range 8-30% reduction of MWB, depending on the type of seasonality, and clearing
efficiency

εS

(surviving snail fraction).

The MDA-only strategy looks qualitatively similar to the previous case, prescribed N-function (Figure 6).
The optimal timing is close to mid-season τ ≈ .5 (Table 4 and supplement) is near mid-season. The
mean burden reduction is much more significant now, varies in the range 80-97%, compared to
molluscicide.
The combined (MDA+ molluscicide) strategy was implemented at fixed snail removal rate, ε S
3 choice of MDA efficacy-coverage,

= 0.3 , and

ε M = ( 0.3,0.45,0.5 ) . In the first experiment we run simultaneous

MDA and molluscicide with different seasonal timing τ . We also looked at then effect of seasonal
amplitude a, strong or weak seasonality. The results are shown in Table 5. Overall, the effect of seasonal
timing τ is less significant now, compared to molluscicide or MDA alone, though it increases with higher
MDA efficacy. We believe this is due to different optimal values of τ for MDA (typical τ ≈ 0.5 ), and for
molluscicide (typical τ ≈ 0 ).
The maximal reduction varies (depending on

ε M ) in the range 90-97% for type I ( a = 0.9 ), and

somewhat better results for type II with ( a = 0.6 ); both cases represent strong seasonal variability. We
observe similar results, but significant reduction (82-95%) for moderate or weak seasonality ( a = 0.5 ,
type I, and a = 0.3 type II). The reason for improved control outcomes at higher a, is the reduced
sustainability (endemicity) in highly variable environments, as explained above.

In the final experiment we took independent optimal τ , suggested by earlier simulations, τ = 0.5 for
MDA, and τ = 0 for molluscicide. The results are shown in Table 6 (upper half), and compared results to
the previous case, i.e. simultaneous MDA+ molluscicide schedule Table 5.
Overall, we achieve further improvement (by factor 2-3) compared to best selection of Table 5 (lower
half of Table 6). Depending of seasonal amplitude/type, and MDA coverage-efficacy

ε M , the reduction

can go as low as 0.5% of the baseline MWB.
We also find that adding molluscicide to MDA can bring a significant improvement, when both controls
are properly timed.

Conclusions and discussion
The Basic reproduction number

R0 is a dimensionless parameter widely used in infection modeling. It

applies to model reduction (via non-dimensionalization), analysis of equilibria, endemic states and
control. In simple cases it can be estimated directly from model inputs (transmission, recovery/ loss
rates), and provides full information on endemicity or elimination. One can extend it for large systems
with multiple compartments, like SWB, but its scope is more limited. In the SWB models, analysis of
endemicity/ elimination requires at least 2 dimensionless parameters (see 9).
Variable dynamic environment poses significant challenges. Here

alone cannot be used for

prediction / analysis, without additional information on temporal variability. A conventional approach of
seasonal averaging and reduction to quasi-stationary model is approximately valid at low seasonal
variability. But it can depart markedly at high seasonal amplitude, both in terms of sustained infection
and MDA responses. In general, increased variability makes infection less sustainable, so seasonal-mean
MWB would drop with increased amplitude (or standard deviation) of varying snail population. It implies
that such system may be more amenable to control interventions, compared to its stationary (mean)
counterpart.
Regular MDA regimen gives another example of periodic dynamic perturbation, where naïve application
of

R0

could also fail. Comparing two types of variability, seasonal snail vs. repeated MDA, we draw the

following conclusions: i) in the former case (seasonal snail),

R0

would typically overestimate

sustainability of infection; ii) in the latter case, if we assume suitable drug efficacy and MDA coverage,

control-induced reproductive number 𝑅𝑅𝑐𝑐 would predict elimination, while the system is locked in a limit
cycle.

One basic conclusion of our analysis is the need to employ direct dynamic simulations in all cases of
unsteady (seasonal) transmission.
Such direct simulation allows one to explore, among other optimal timing for MDA, snail control or
integrated strategies in variable environment.
For MDA alone we found such optimal timing is close to half-season, which corresponds to minimal
carrying capacity for snails. It’s also close to minimal snail density, which could be used as more practical
measure for optimal MDA timing. We also found its progress (relative burden reduction), over shortterm 6-year control program, could vary markedly, and ‘optimal’ timing can achieve up to 50%
improvement compared to suboptimal’ timing.
For molluscicide control, the optimal timing is shifted closer to start of season, i.e. snail peak, but overall
effect of molluscicide on burden reduction is less significant than MDA, even at high killing efficacy.
The combined strategy MDA and molluscicide, can give an additional reduction of worm burden,
compared to MDA alone. When both interventions are implemented simultaneously, intra-seasonal
variability is less significant, since optimal choices for each one differs. But each intervention
implemented at its own optimal timing can achieve much better results.
Overall, snail control can add significantly to the program outcome; in some cases it can lead to nearelimination after short (6-year) duration
High seasonal variability gives better control outcomes in all cases, as it makes transmission and
endemicity less sustainable.

Supplement
SWB system
The SWB approach was developed and refined in several papers (8-10,22-25). It has many advantages
compared to MacDonald MWB, simple or ‘mated’ (NB) version. SWB system carries detailed information
on burden distribution and egg release by host population, but it requires no prior assumptions on
burden distribution, like NB. Within-host worm biology (mating, mortality, fecundity) is naturally
accommodated in SWB. While the number of SWB variables can be large (depending on stratification), it
has the same parameters as MacDonald. In fact, the MWB variable w ( t ) is given by the first statistical
moment (mean) of SWB distribution, and the w-equation of (1.7)-(1.4) is derived from SWB equations.
The main difference between MWB and SWB comes in the snail force of infection (FOI) Λ -. For
MacDonald system, Λ is a function of single (MWB) variable w, for SWB it depends on human infectivity
E - combined egg release by worm burden strata, worm mating and fecundity. There is no direct link
between w and E.
Like simple MacDonald system, coupled SWB-snail system has a R0 parameter that can be computed
from its basic inputs. Such a parameter has similar meaning to MacDonald R0 , namely R0SWB > 1 implies
unstable zero and stable endemic state, while R0SWB < 1 has stable zero. Beyond that it carries no
information on endemic state, variable environment, or dynamic interventions (MDA control outcomes).
In fact, more detailed information on SWB equilibria can be derived from two transmission confidents A,
B rather than their product (like R0 ). So, communities with identical human infection, but different snail
environment (hence different pairs A, B) can produce vastly divergent control outcomes (Supplement).

Parameter R0 of coupled SWB-snail system
Here we derive R0 formula for coupled SWB-snail system, assuming logistic snail population growth,
and SEI snail infection dynamics, and nonlinear snail force of infection (FOI) (29).
The relevant input parameters are listed in Table 1.

Formula (0.1) could be further extended to demographically structured SWB communities (e.g. children
+ SAC + adult et al).
Formula (0.1) can be derived from the Jacobian analysis of the coupled system at zero equilibrium.
Specifically, condition R0 = 1 marks a transition from stable to unstable zero (i.e. stable endemic state).
But there is no direct link between R0 and endemic state, or possible MDA control outcomes.

In fact, a wide range of equilibria arises by varying dimensionless transmission rates

Figure F(a) shows that ‘endemic persistence - elimination’ regions in the (A,B) –parameter
space– deviate markedly from isocontours of R0 . This deviation renders it useless for analysis/prediction
of long-term outcomes.

Periodic MDA for MacDonald systems
Here we shall use stationary transmission environment, but vary transmission coefficients.
Specifically, we fixed R0 = 3 , and took 4 A-values in the range 2-3.5. Figure G (a) shows the resulting
reduced MacDonald functions (Box 1), and equilibria (zero – breakpoint - endemic). As transmission
coefficients are proportional to population densities ( A ∝ N - snail, B ∝ H - human), different (snail
per human) A/B ratio correspond to different transmission environments, and under identical R0 they
can produce different outcomes, Figure G (b). In all 4 scenarios, disease is eliminated in finite time, once
prevalence falls below the breakpoint. But higher A (large snail-to-human ratio) have stronger rebound
and require more MDA rounds. Figure G (b) show MDA histories for the reduced MacDonald system.
Next we compared MDA predictions of the reduced model with the full host-vector MacDonald
system, panels (c-f) of Figure G. The two models have comparable predictions at low transmission A = 2
, but they diverge markedly as A increases. In most cases the reduced model exhibits stronger post-MDA
rebound, and therefore takes longer to eliminate, or to reach a breakpoint. The extreme case is A = 3.5
(panel (f)), where complete model goes to elimination after 25 years of MDA, while the reduced model
is locked in a limit cycle
