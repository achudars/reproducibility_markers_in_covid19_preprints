ABSTRACT
Introduction: Timing of cord clamping and other cord management strategies may improve outcomes
at preterm birth. However, it is unclear whether benefits apply to all preterm subgroups such as those
who usually receive immediate neonatal care. Previous and current trials compare various policies,
including immediate cord clamping, time- or physiology-based deferred cord clamping, and cord
milking. Individual participant data (IPD) enables exploration of different strategies within subgroups.
Network meta-analysis (NMA) enables comparison and ranking of all available interventions using a
combination of direct and indirect comparisons.
Objectives: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of cord management strategies for preterm infants on
neonatal mortality and morbidity overall and for different participant characteristics using IPD metaanalysis; and 2) to evaluate and rank the effect of different cord management strategies for preterm
births on mortality and other key outcomes using NMA.
Methods and analysis: We will conduct a systematic search of Medline, Embase, clinical trial registries,
and other sources for all planned, ongoing and completed randomised controlled trials comparing
alternative cord management strategies at preterm birth (before 37 weeks’ gestation). IPD will be
sought for all trials. First, deferred clamping and cord milking will be compared with immediate clamping
in pairwise IPD meta-analyses. The primary outcome will be death prior to hospital discharge. Effect
differences will be explored for pre-specified subgroups of participants. Second, all identified cord
management strategies will be compared and ranked in an IPD NMA for the primary outcome and the
key secondary outcomes intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade) and infant blood transfusions (any).
Treatment effect differences by participant characteristics will be identified. Inconsistency and
heterogeneity will be explored.
Ethics and dissemination: Approved by University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee
(2018/886). Results will be relevant to clinicians, guideline-developers and policy-makers, and will be
disseminated via publications, presentations, and media releases.
Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12619001305112.

STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
•

•
•
•
•

This will be the most comprehensive review to date of interventions for umbilical cord
management in preterm infants and the findings will be highly relevant to clinicians and
guideline developers
The use of individual participant data will allow assessment of the best treatment option for key
subgroups of participants
Network meta-analysis will enable the comparison and ranking of all available treatment
options using direct and indirect evidence
For some of the trials it will not be possible to obtain individual participant data, so published
aggregate results will be used instead
Risk of bias in the primary trials will be assessed using Cochrane criteria, and certainty of
evidence for the meta-analyses will be appraised using the GRADE approach for the pairwise
comparisons, and the CINeMA approach for the network meta-analysis

INTRODUCTION
Currently over 15 million babies are born preterm annually and this number is rising.(1-3) Of these, 1.1
million die, and the morbidity and healthcare costs amongst survivors and their families are high, with
preterm survivors having an increased risk of cognitive, developmental and behavioural difficulties, and
chronic ill health.(4-9) Hence, even modest improvements in outcomes of preterm birth would
substantially benefit the children, their families, and also health services. In uncompromised babies,
deferring cord clamping has been shown to be beneficial and is now used in routine practice.(10)
However, it is unclear whether these benefits apply to preterm babies who usually receive immediate
neonatal care, and whether any benefits outweigh potential harms. In addition, there are multiple
competing cord management strategies, such as clamping the cord at different times or milking the
cord, and considerations of the infant’s respiratory status, and it is currently unknown which strategy
yields the best balance of benefits and harms.
Current approaches to cord clamping
One potential mechanism of deferring umbilical cord clamping is a net transfer of blood from the
placenta to the baby known as “placental transfusion”. If the cord is not clamped at birth immediately,
blood flow between the placenta and the baby may continue for up to five minutes in term infants.(1113) For preterm births, blood flow may continue for longer,(14) since a greater proportion of fetoplacental circulating blood volume is still in the placenta.(15) This has led to time-based approaches to
deferring cord clamping that have been shown to increase peak haematocrit and reduce the need for
blood transfusions.(16) Yet, recent findings suggest that placental transfusion does not always occur blood flow may continue without any net transfer, and sometimes net transfer may be to the
placenta.(17) Initial neonatal care and stabilisation traditionally takes place on a resuscitation platform
at the side of the room or in an adjacent room. Deferred cord clamping is thus often associated with a
delay in neonatal care and this has led to concerns including delayed resuscitation and hypothermia (18)
particularly for very preterm infants and infants assessed as requiring resuscitation. An alternate
emerging strategy is to provide immediate neonatal care with the cord intact beside the woman using
a mobile resuscitation trolley or on the mother’s leg. (19-24)
Another potential mechanism of deferred clamping is allowing time for the infant to establish
spontaneous breathing whilst still placentally supported. Immediate cord clamping before the infant
has established breathing may be harmful since it can lead to large fluctuations in blood pressure, a
period of hypoxia, and restricted cardiac function.(25) Animal and pilot human studies suggest that
breathing and lung aeration before cord clamping can improve cardiovascular stability and oxygenation,
and reduce intraventricular haemorrhage and infant mortality.(26-29) They also suggest that initial
respiratory support before clamping the cord can improve cerebral oxygenation and blood pressure,
and reduce cerebrovascular impairment compared with immediate cord clamping.(30, 31) This evidence
has led to the rise of “physiological cord clamping” which defers clamping until after the onset of
breathing. Yet, onset of breathing is not always easy to determine without the assistance of video or
extra equipment, whilst timing to cord clamping can be easily measured. In an earlier study,(32) time of
onset of breathing in preterm infants receiving gentle stimulation was related to time after birth – within
a minute over 90% of preterm infants had begun spontaneous breathing.

Cord milking or stripping (pinching the umbilical cord close to the mother and moving the fingers
towards the infant) may be a way to increase preterm blood volume without deferring clamping.(33)
Yet, a preterm lamb model demonstrated that during cord milking there was a transient increase to
carotid blood flow and pressure.(34) A recent trial comparing deferred cord clamping with cord milking
was stopped early in the subgroup of extremely preterm infants (23-27 weeks), as the incidence of
severe intraventricular haemorrhage was higher in the cord milking group.(35) Hence, the effect of cord
milking in different populations needs further elucidation.
Current guidelines for cord management at birth and previous reviews of aggregate data
Current uncertainties in optimal cord management strategies are reflected in varying guidelines. The
World Health Organization (WHO) recommends late cord clamping (36) unless resuscitation is required,
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends waiting for 30 seconds to 3
minutes if mother and baby are stable, (37) and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
Council (ILCOR) recommends a delay in cord clamping of at least 1 minute. If the baby is assessed as
requiring resuscitation (which is the case in many preterm infants), (38) WHO recommends immediate
clamping, (39) NICE recommends considering cord milking before clamping, and ILCOR concludes that
there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations. (38)
A 2012 Cochrane review of timing of cord clamping for preterm births (40) included 15 trials, with 738
infants, of which one trial (with 40 infants) compared cord milking with immediate cord clamping.(41)
There was heterogeneity in the timing of cord clamping and gestational age at recruitment, and data
were insufficient for reliable conclusions about any of the primary outcomes of the review. A systematic
review and meta-analysis published in 2018 (including 18 trials with 2834 infants) compared the effect
of deferred (≥30 seconds) versus early (<30 seconds) clamping in preterm infants, and found a reduction
in the primary outcome of hospital mortality by 32% (Risk Ratio = 0.68, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.520.90). (16) There was heterogeneity in the definition of ‘early cord clamping’ ranging from less than 5 to
25 seconds, and “late cord clamping”, ranging from 30 to 180 seconds. Recruitment age varied from 22
weeks to 36 weeks gestational age. Most analyses of infant and maternal morbidity were substantially
underpowered. (16) The review concluded that while there is high quality evidence that deferred cord
clamping improves outcomes, individual participant data analyses are urgently needed to further
understand the benefits and potential harms of different cord management strategies, and to
understand whether differential treatment options are advantageous for key subgroups of infants. (16)
This ongoing uncertainty about the optimal cord management strategy, and differential cord
management strategies for key subgroups of infants (e.g. for those for which resuscitation and/or
stabilisation is deemed necessary, or extremely preterm infants) has led to 113 planned, ongoing or
published trials (in more than 15,000 preterm babies) that are comparing a range of cord management
strategies. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is the gold standard for combining such trial
data. IPD provides larger statistical power for estimation of treatment effects of rarer secondary
endpoints and enables reliable subgroup analyses to examine hypotheses about differences in
treatment effect, exploring interactions between treatment- and participant-level characteristics. (42)
A network meta-analysis (NMA) facilitates data synthesis when there are a range of interventions
available and permits indirect comparisons across all interventions by inferring the relative effectiveness
of two competing treatments through a common comparator.(43, 44) NMA produces relative effect

estimates for each intervention compared with every other intervention in the network. These effect
sizes can be used to obtain rankings of the effectiveness of the interventions.(45) Using IPD in a NMA
(as opposed to aggregate data) can improve precision, increase information, and reduce bias. (46)
Objectives
The aims of this study are:
1) to evaluate the effectiveness of cord management strategies for preterm infants on neonatal
mortality and morbidity, and to evaluate patient-level modifiers of treatment effect.
2) to evaluate, compare and rank the effectiveness of different cord management strategies for
preterm infants on mortality and the key secondary outcomes intraventricular haemorrhage
(any grade) and infant blood transfusions (any).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
We will conduct a systematic review of randomised trials with individual participant data using pairwise
and network meta-analysis, and a nested prospective meta-analysis. The lead investigator for all
potentially eligible studies will be contacted and invited to collaborate and join the individual participant
data Cord Management at Preterm birth (iCOMP) Collaboration. Eligible trials identified up to February
2019 are listed in Supplementary File 1. The Collaboration will undertake this project according to the
methods recommended by the Cochrane Individual Participant Data, Multiple Interventions, and
Prospective Meta-Analysis Methods Groups.(42, 47, 48) This protocol is registered on the Australian
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) and is undergoing editorial review for registration on the
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Reporting guidelines for NMA
protocols by Chaimani et al (49) and PRISMA extension for IPDs and protocols (50, 51) have been
followed for reporting (checklist provided in Supplementary File 2).
Eligibility criteria
Types of studies
Studies will be included if they are randomised trials. Cluster-randomised and quasi-random studies will
be excluded. Studies must compare at least two of the interventions of interest (defined below).
Trial participants
Participants will be women giving birth preterm (before 37 completed weeks’ gestation) and/or their
babies. Individually randomised studies will be eligible for inclusion if the unit of randomisation was
either the woman, or the baby. Women and babies will be included regardless of whether mode of
delivery was vaginal or caesarean, and whether the birth was singleton or multiple. Babies will be
included regardless of whether or not they received immediate resuscitation at birth.
Types of interventions and comparators in pairwise meta-analysis
For the pairwise meta-analysis we will include all trials that compare an intervention to enhance
umbilical blood flow or allow more time for physiological transition to the comparator immediate cord
clamping. This includes interventions assessing cord management strategies for timing of cord clamping,

and other strategies such as cord milking. Trials will be included regardless of whether initial neonatal
care is provided with the umbilical cord intact, or not. Different strategies (i.e. deferred cord clamping
and cord milking) will be analysed in separate subgroups to assess comparability between the groups
by assessing subgroup effects and heterogeneity. They will then be collapsed into one “cord
management intervention” group if they are deemed comparable based on the previous subgroup
assessments. If they are deemed non-comparable they will be analysed and interpreted separately.
Types of interventions and comparators in network meta-analysis
For the network meta-analysis we will include, as interventions of interest, strategies for timing of cord
clamping, and other cord management strategies to influence umbilical flow and placental transfusion.
Thus, interventions of interest include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Immediate cord clamping without milking (≤15 seconds or trialist defined)
Short deferral of cord clamping (>15 to <45 seconds) without milking
Medium deferral of cord clamping (≥45 to <90 seconds) without milking
Long deferral of cord clamping (≥ 90 seconds) without milking
Cord milking or stripping before immediate cord clamping (intact cord milking)
Cord milking or stripping before deferred cord clamping (intact cord milking)
Cord milking or stripping after immediate cord clamping (cut cord milking)
Cord milking or stripping after deferred cord clamping (cut cord milking)
Physiological clamping (clamping after aeration of lungs)

If we identify other interventions not listed above we will include them if they are addressing cord
management or related strategies to influence umbilical flow and placental transfusion. Again, trials
will be included regardless of whether initial neonatal care is provided with the umbilical cord intact, or
not. Studies evaluating collection and storage of residual placental blood that is then used for
transfusion after birth will be excluded. All possible comparisons between eligible interventions are
displayed in Figure 1. For interpretation purposes, immediate cord clamping will act as the basis
comparison/ parameter.
Nodes that specify different timings of cord clamping were defined according to what timing is classified
as immediate clamping, short deferral, medium deferral or long deferral according to the literature to
date (as shown in Supplementary File 1), and after discussion with clinicians. Different timings are
commonly compared in head-to-head comparisons, hence, their classification as different intervention
nodes. Similarly, nodes that specify cord milking were classified after a review of current milking
techniques described in the literature and after discussion with clinicians. If insufficient data are
available, categories will be collapsed where possible. For instance, milking before and after immediate
cord clamping could be collapsed into one single immediate cord milking category, or medium and long
delay could be collapsed into a medium to long delay category. We consider the interventions of interest
to be jointly randomisable (i.e. each participant could, in principle, be randomised to any one of the
interventions of interest).

Types of outcome measures
Trials must report at least one of the clinical outcomes included in this review, as specified in the
“measures” section below, to be included.
Eligibility for nested prospective meta-analysis
Studies are only included in the nested prospective meta-analysis if the investigator/s were blind to
outcome data by intervention group at the time the main components of the protocol (i.e. objectives,
aims and hypotheses, eligibility criteria, subgroup and sensitivity analyses and main outcomes) were
initially agreed in January 2015.
Information sources and search strategy
The search strategy to identify potentially eligible studies will include a search of the Cochrane
Collaboration Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group’s Trial Register. This register contains trials
identified from: monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and
CINAHL (EBSCO); weekly searches of Medline (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid); hand searches of specialty

journals and major conferences proceedings; and current awareness alerts from further journals and
BioMed Central. Further details can be found elsewhere.(52) We will identify ongoing trials that may be
eligible by searching for published protocols in Medline and Embase, searching online registries of
clinical trials, and personal contacts (for example, by asking collaborators to notify any unregistered
studies they are aware of). The Chief Investigators of eligible trials will be invited to join the iCOMP
Collaboration. They will also be asked if they know of any further planned, ongoing or completed
studies. The search strategy is outlined in more detail in Supplementary File 3.
Selection of studies for inclusion in the review
Two members of the iCOMP Secretariat (see project management section below) will independently
assess all the potentially eligible studies identified for inclusion. Disagreements will be resolved by
discussion or, if required, by consulting a third member of the iCOMP Secretariat. Studies that are not
willing or able to provide IPD will be synthesised where possible using aggregate data.
Data collection, management, and confidentiality
Data receipt
De-identified, individual participant level data will be provided by each participating trial. These data
will be backed-up and stored in a centralised secure database.
Data processing
Data checking: For each trial, range and internal consistency of all variables will be checked. Intervention
details and missing data will be checked against any protocols, published reports, and data collection
sheets. Integrity of the randomisation process will be assessed by examining the chronological
randomisation sequence and the balance of participant characteristics across intervention groups. Any
inconsistencies or missing data will be discussed with the trialists and resolved by consensus. Each
included study will be analysed separately and the results sent to the trial investigators for verification
prior to inclusion in the iCOMP database. All trial-specific outcomes generated from the IPD will be crosschecked against published information via a series of crosstabs.
Data re-coding: Outcome data may have been collected in different formats across trials. Therefore, the
de-identified data from each of the trials will be extracted and re-formatted into a commonly coded
dataset.
Data transformation and collating: Once the data from each of the trials are finalised, they will be
combined into a single dataset, but a trial identifier code for each participant will be retained. New
variables will be generated from the combined dataset as required to address the hypotheses to be
tested.
Risk of bias assessment and certainty of evidence appraisal
Eligible studies will be assessed for risk of bias using the criteria described in the Cochrane
Handbook(53): random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and
personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; and other
bias. Certainty of evidence will be appraised using the GRADE approach (54) for the pairwise

comparisons, and the rating approach suggested by Salanti and colleagues that is implemented in the
CINeMA application for the network meta-analysis.(55)
Outcomes measures for pairwise meta-analysis
All outcome measures for the pairwise meta-analysis are listed in Table 1. The primary outcome will be
death of the baby prior to hospital discharge. As outcomes for babies born very preterm (before 32
weeks’ gestation) are different to those born moderately preterm (32 to 37 weeks), separate analyses
will be conducted for these two groups of infants for the secondary outcomes. Where possible,
definitions will be standardised, otherwise outcomes will be used as defined in individual trials.
Secondary outcomes will include measures of neonatal and maternal morbidity, and health service use.
Covariates and subgroups for pairwise meta-analysis
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the primary outcome of death (prior to hospital discharge) and
two key secondary outcomes (IVH any grade and any infant blood transfusion) if sufficient data are
available. All included covariates and subgroups are listed in Table 1. The comparative effects of
alternative cord management strategies may vary depending on key infant risk factors, and/or on the
level and type of neonatal care available at the hospital of birth. Thus, there will be subgroup analyses
based on participant level characteristics and based on hospital level characteristics. If data are
insufficient for the pre-specified subgroup analyses, categories will be collapsed.

Data analysis for pairwise meta-analysis
The full Statistical Analysis Plan will be agreed on by the iCOMP Collaboration before any analyses are
undertaken. Analyses will include all randomised participants for which data are available, and the
primary analyses will be based on intention-to-treat. Analyses will be conducted using the open-source
software R.(56)
For each outcome, a one-stage approach to analysis will be employed to include individual participant
data from all eligible trials in a multilevel random or mixed effects regression model. Aggregate data will
be included were individual participant data are unavailable.(57) Relative heterogeneity of treatment
effects across trials will be estimated using I2, with further inclusion in secondary models of participant
level and trial level covariates to explain the sources of heterogeneity. Prediction intervals will be
estimated to ascertain absolute heterogeneity. Forest plots will be presented by trial for the primary
outcome, and for any secondary outcomes where there is evidence of heterogeneity across trials.
We will use a generalised linear modelling framework, with the choice of outcome distribution and link
function dependent on outcome type. For example, binomial with log link will be used to estimate risk
ratios for binary outcomes, and Gaussian with identity link for mean differences, with logtransformation of the data if appropriate. We will follow a similar approach for secondary outcomes.
For estimation of subgroup effects, we will present forest plots of pooled treatment effects according
to pre-specified subgroup variables, and estimate effects by including appropriate interaction terms
between a subgroup variable and treatment arm in the regression models. The results of all comparative
analyses will be presented using appropriate estimates of treatment effect along with 95% confidence
intervals and two-sided p-values.
In advance of conducting the analyses, we will decide whether there are sufficient reliable data to allow
meaningful analysis of any individual outcome or subgroup. If not, the analysis will not be conducted,
and this will be reported subsequently.
Outcome measures for network meta-analysis
The primary outcome for the network meta-analysis will be death of the baby during the initial hospital
stay. If data availability permits, IVH (any grade) and blood transfusion (any) will be analysed as two key
secondary outcomes.
Covariates and subgroups for network meta-analysis
Gestational week at birth and highest level of available care will be considered as effect modifiers to
improve consistency of the NMA model. There will be subgroup analyses assessing treatment effect by
week of gestational age, and by comparing babies assessed as in need of immediate resuscitation versus
not in need of immediate resuscitation.
Assessment of the transitivity assumption for network meta-analysis
Transitivity in the network will be assured by only including interventions that are regarded as jointly
randomisable and by limiting our sample to preterm infants. Gestational age at birth, hospital setting

(highest level of available neonatal care), as well as study year may act as effect modifiers and could
influence the transitivity of the network. We will therefore investigate whether these variables are
distributed evenly across comparisons. If we find any of those variables to be unevenly distributed, they
will be included in the network as covariates to investigate their influence on the network and on
possible inconsistency.
Data analysis for network meta-analysis
As for the pairwise meta-analysis, all analyses will be specified a-priori in a full Statistical Analysis Plan,
all randomised participants for which data are available will be included, and the primary analyses will
be intention-to-treat.
We will calculate a two-step random-effects contrast-based network meta-regression to compare and
rank all available interventions for the primary outcome death (during initial hospital stay) and, if data
permits, for the two key secondary outcomes - IVH (any grade) and blood transfusion (any). Summary
risk ratios with confidence and prediction intervals will be presented for each pairwise comparison in a
league table. We will estimate the ranking probability of each intervention being at each rank, and we
will use surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and mean ranks to obtain a treatment
hierarchy. A frequentist approach to analysis will be used. Should models not converge, a Bayesian
approach will be used instead, setting a prior of no effect and a large variance. Correlations induced by
multi-arm studies will be accounted for using multivariate distributions.
As a second step, interactions between key covariates and effect estimates will be tested, assuming a
common interaction across comparisons. If there are statistically significant interactions between
covariates and treatment effects, we will provide probability rankings of intervention effects by
subgroup for these covariates. A single heterogeneity parameter will be assumed for each network.
Assessment of inconsistency for network meta-analysis
Global consistency will be assessed using the Q statistics for inconsistency and the design-by-treatment
interaction model. Local consistency will be assessed using the loop-specific approach and the nodesplitting approach to explore sources of inconsistency. Since tests of inconsistency are known to have
low power,(58) results will be interpreted with caution, and potential known sources for inconsistency
will be explored even if there is no statistical evidence of inconsistency. Any detected inconsistency will
be explored by including covariates into the model, and by excluding potential outlier studies in
sensitivity analyses. A judgement of excessive heterogeneity or inconsistency would prevent the
interpretation and reporting of the network meta-analysis.
Assessment of compliance with the allocated intervention
Compliance with the interventions will be described for each trial. For studies of early versus deferred
cord clamping this will be based on i) the time to cord clamping in each allocated group, and ii) the
difference in time between early and deferred clamping. For studies comparing cord milking with no
milking, this will be based on i) time to cord clamping in the allocated groups, and ii) reported
compliance with cord milking in both groups.

Assessment of selection bias
We will perform a nested prospective meta-analysis as a sensitivity analysis, to detect potential
differences between prospectively and retrospectively included studies that may point to selection or
publication bias. We expect to also be able to include some unreported outcomes sourced from the
individual participant data provided by the included studies, alleviating selective outcome reporting
bias. Additionally, comparison-adjusted and contour-enhanced funnel plots(59) will be utilised to
examine whether there are differences in results between more and less precise studies.
Adjustments for multiple testing
There is only one primary outcome, and few key secondary outcomes for this study. For other secondary
outcomes, no formal adjustments for multiple testing are planned but instead, we will be following the
approach outlined by Schulz and Grimes(60): as secondary outcomes examined in this study are
interrelated, we will interpret the pattern of results, examining consistency of results across related
outcomes, instead of focusing on any single, statistically significant result. All secondary outcomes will
be reported. Subgroup analyses will be performed by testing for interactions and findings will be
reported as exploratory.(61)
Planned sensitivity analyses
To assess whether results are robust to trial characteristics and methods of analysis, the following
sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the primary outcome, if data are sufficient:
•
•

•

•
•
•

Excluding studies with high risk of bias for sequence generation and/or concealment of
allocation and/or loss to follow up for pairwise and network meta-analysis;
For trials comparing early cord clamping with deferred clamping, analysis of outcomes
weighted by degree of separation in mean actual timing of cord clamping between intervention
and control groups for pairwise meta-analysis;
Analysis of outcomes weighted by degree of separation in haemoglobin (at 24 hours) achieved
between intervention and control groups for pairwise meta-analysis (as a surrogate for
net placental transfusion);
For trials with deferred cord clamping, an additional dose-response analysis assessing intended
time of cord clamping deferral as a continuous variable will be performed;
Exploratory analysis based on actual, rather than intended, timing of cord clamping for
individual participants for pairwise and network meta-analysis;
The impact of missing data on the effects of the included interventions for the primary outcome
may be explored (if appropriate).

Project management
The iCOMP Collaboration will invite membership from representatives of each of the included trials
contributing individual participant data, have a Secretariat, and invite methodological and clinical
experts who will form an Advisory Group. The Secretariat will be responsible for data collection,
management and analysis, and for communication within the Collaboration.

For each included trial, ethics approval has been previously granted by their respective Human Research
Ethics Committees (or equivalent), and informed consent has been obtained from all participants. The
Chief Investigators of the included trials remain the custodians of their own trial’s data. Individual
participant data from the included trials will be de-identified before sharing with the iCOMP
Collaboration. Ethics approval for this project has been granted by the University of Sydney Human
Research Ethics Committee (number: 2018/886).
Publication policy
The key methods for this meta-analysis protocol were agreed by the iCOMP Collaborators in January
2015, before unblinding of any outcome data from the studies included in the nested prospective metaanalysis. This manuscript was discussed at the iCOMP Collaborators’ meeting held at the Pediatric
Academic Societies meeting in San Diego in April 2015. At this meeting it was agreed the protocol should
be expanded to include a retrospective systematic review and individual participant data and network
meta-analysis with a nested prospective meta-analysis. The protocol was then revised, based on further
discussion, and circulated to members of the iCOMP Collaboration for further comment and agreement
prior to manuscript submission.
Participating trialists in the prospective meta-analysis, when reporting results from their own trials, will
endeavour to include a statement that their trial is part of this prospective meta-analysis in any
published manuscripts or conference abstracts. Any reports of the results of this meta-analysis will be
published either in the name of the collaborative group, or by representatives of the collaborative group
on behalf of the iCOMP Collaboration, as agreed by members of the collaborative group. Draft reports
will be circulated to the collaborative group for comment and approval before submission for
publication.

DISCUSSION
There is an urgency to conduct this systematic review and pairwise individual participant data and
network meta-analysis so we can make sense of the numerous trials currently being undertaken, inform
clinical practice, and identify the most promising interventions for further evaluation.
This meta-analysis offers an opportunity to reliably test important hypotheses that cannot be resolved
by any of the individual trials, either alone or in simple combination. Coordinating international efforts
in this way will help achieve consensus on the most important substantive clinical outcomes to assess
in any future trials as needed. Unequivocal synthesised results, together with the identification of key
determinants (e.g. effect modifiers), will be critical for translating evidence from this meta-analysis
directly into practice. Figure 2 shows the network of comparisons available from the trials identified to
date. We plan to complete study identification and individual participant data collection by end-2019,
then conduct the analyses and disseminate results by mid-2021.
This study is only possible because trialists around the world have agreed to collaborate to share the
individual participant data from their cord management trials. This collaborative approach will enable
us to move beyond the traditional “one-size-fits-all” and towards precision medicine, to find the optimal
intervention from a range of treatment options for each individual woman and her baby, based on their
individual characteristics and risk factors.
