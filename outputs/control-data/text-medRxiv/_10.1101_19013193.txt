Abstract

Background: Childhood suicidality is a major public health concern with poorly defined
neurobiology, especially in young people. We sought to address this gap by examining
multimodal brain imaging correlates of suicidality in a US population-based sample of schoolaged children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study.
Methods: Unrelated 9-10-year-olds (N=7,994) were subjected to a comprehensive assessment of
individual, environmental and clinical characteristics, and underwent multimodal brain imaging.
Given the sample size, we tested for both differences and equivalence of means in brain
measures between children with endorsed suicidality, either by self- or/and caregiver-report, and
never-suicidal children.
Results: Passive suicidal ideation was the most prevalence expression of suicidality. Children
endorsing suicidality evidenced higher levels of individual and parental psychopathology and
reported higher rates of stressful life-events and family adversity. No robust associations were
observed between suicidality and any neuroimaging modality.
Conclusions: Vulnerability to suicidality in young children does not appear to have a discrete
brain signature when considering macro-scale brain measures. The longitudinal design of the
ABCD will allow us to test whether such a signature may become established during adolescent
development.

Main

Suicide deaths and suicidality —defined as suicide ideation, plans and attempts - have been
rising dramatically amongst young people (>50%) in the last decade, especially in those children
over 11 years of age 1-3, making suicide the second-leading cause of death in those aged 10-19
years 2,4. Whereas risk factors for suicidality have been well-established, these have
demonstrated poor predictive validity 5-7. In response, studies examining neurobiological
underpinnings of suicidality have been on the rise 8. However, most of these studies have been
conducted in adult samples and, very few, in small clinical samples of adolescents. Given the rise
of suicidality and psychopathology after puberty in the general population 3,9-11, there is a need to
understand better the neural mechanism underlying suicide risk in younger children. In this
article, we leveraged the unique resource of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development
(ABCD) study to examine the neural correlates of suicidality in a large population-based sample
of school-aged children.

Systematic attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms of suicidal thoughts and
behaviours have been made at least since the early 19th century 12,13, and are still a focus of
intense discussion, both overall (see, for example, 6,14) and in youth specifically 15-18. For
example, epidemiological studies in children and adolescents have established that suicidality is
associated with higher levels of distress, disruptive and impulsive behaviors, higher rates of
psychiatric disorders and substance abuse, history of adverse life events, family dysfunction,
poor school environment, and parental history of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors,
among others 15,16,19-25. Individual, environmental and clinical risk factors of youth suicidality

have been well replicated in these studies; however, the predictive value of these factors is
limited due to low sensitivity 5-7. In response, several studies have attempted to identify the
neurobiological underpinnings of suicidal behaviour with the aim of improving and targeting
suicide prevention strategies. Whereas the number of studies reporting neuroimaging correlates
of suicidality has grown exponentially in the last two decades 8, our understanding of the neural
mechanisms underlying suicidality in young children is still poor.

In the most recent and comprehensive review of neuroimaging correlates of suicidality the
authors reported some converging evidence across studies with regions involved in affective
processing and impulsive regulation, including ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortex, cingulate
cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, insula, thalamus, striatum, and posterior regions such as
posterior cingulate cortex, lateral temporal lobes and cerebellum8. However, the authors also
emphasized the modest sample sizes and heterogeneity across studies. Moreover, it is still
unclear whether these findings apply to children for several reasons. First, most neuroimaging
studies examining suicidality have been conducted in adult samples and sometimes yielding
inconsistent findings. For example, two recent meta-analysis of brain structural imaging studies
failed to find robust differences between suicidal and non-suicidal participants 26,27, and aberrant
functional engagement of the regions mentioned above have been reported with little inter-study
consistency in terms of directionality of findings

8,28-33

. Second, studies in young people are too

scarce to draw firm conclusions 34-42. Collectively, these studies have implicated aberrant
activations and connectivity in brain regions associated with affective processing 34,38,40 and
cognitive control 35,37,39. However, all these studies were conducted in small clinical samples of

adolescents with mood disorders 8, which have high propensity of bias and hampers the
generalizability to younger children and the general population.

If we were to find neuroimaging correlates of suicidality among school-aged children, it would
be important because both suicidal behaviors and psychopathology increase dramatically after
puberty 9-11; thus, we could identify biomarkers of suicide vulnerability before these are more
likely to occur. Conversely, the lack of differences between the groups would suggest that among
school-aged children, the etiology of suicide does not have a neurobiological basis.

In the current study, we employed data from a large population-based sample from the
Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (https://abcdstudy.org/) 43,44 to
examine the correlates of suicidal behaviors using a multi-informant approach. Using the
baseline data from the ABCD study of children aged 9-10 years, we first examined individual,
environmental and clinical correlates of suicidality typically found at this age 14,16,23-25. Next, we
sought to identify associations between suicidality and multiple brain imaging measures,
including brain morphometry, functional connectivity at rest, and functional measures during
three tasks that involved processes previously associated with suicidality in older samples;
named, reward processing 36,45,46, inhibitory control 37,47, working memory 48,49 and affective
processing 38,40. We tested for differences in these measures using a traditional null hypothesis
significance test. However, within this framework, failure to find a difference does not imply
equivalence of means; or, if a difference is found, this might not be large enough to be deemed
worthwhile. Therefore, in the current study we complemented our analysis approach with

Equivalence tests50, which examine the equivalence of means regardless of the presence or lack
of statistically significant differences.

Methods

The ABCD study
All the data used here were accessed from the ABCD Study Curated Annual Release 2.0 and are
available on request from the NIMH Data Archive (https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/abcd). The
baseline ABCD sample consists of 11,875 children from 22 sites across the United States that
match the demographic profile of the American Community Survey 44. The University of
California at San Diego Institutional Review Board was responsible for the ethical oversight of
the ABCD study. The present study is based on 7,994 unrelated ABCD participants for whom
complete self-report and caregiver data on childhood suicidality were available. As detailed
below and illustrated in Figure 1, the neuroimaging analyses involved subsamples based on the
availability of high-quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for each modality (see
Supplementary information for details).

Determination of childhood suicidality
Suicidality in children was assessed using the child-report and the caregiver-report of the
computerized Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS) for DSM-5
(KSADS-5) 51. The KSADS-5 assesses the following aspects of suicidality: passive suicidal
ideation, active but nonspecific suicidal ideation, suicidal ideation with a specific method, active
suicidal ideation with an intent, active suicidal ideation with a plan, preparatory actions toward
imminent suicidal behavior, interrupted suicidal attempts, aborted suicidal attempts and suicidal
attempts. Children were considered as having experienced suicidality if they or their caregiver
endorsed any of the above items as present either in the past or at the time of the assessment.
Items relating to self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent were not included. Based on

children and caregiver reports, four suicidality groups were computed: 1) child-reported
suicidality 2) caregiver-reported suicidality, 3) concordantly-reported suicidality (i.e., both child
and parent endorse at least one item), and 4) never-suicidal (i.e., both child and parent do not
endorse any item).

Individual and environmental characteristics
We focused on individual and environmental (including family and school) characteristics, as
well as clinical factors that have been associated with suicidality in previous studies 16,19-21,23-25.
Individual and environmental factors comprised the children’s sex, race/ethnicity, general
intelligence, exposure to stressful life events, the presence of common medical conditions,
pubertal development, family income level and economic problems, caregiver education,
caregiver relationship status, family conflict, and school environment. In terms of individual
clinical factors, we examined general psychopathology and psychiatric disorders in the children.
Family clinical factors included general psychopathology in the caregiver, parental use of mental
health services, including hospitalization, parental history of depression, parental history of
suicide attempt or death, and maternal alcohol or substance use during pregnancy. Description
and instruments employed to assess these variables are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

Neuroimaging
High-resolution T1-weighted images as well as task-based and resting-state fMRI data were
obtained at each ABCD site using 3T MRI systems. For the imaging analyses conducted in this
study, a number of scans were excluded because they did not meet quality assurance standards
(see Supplementary information for details). To preserve statistical power given the low number

of children endorsing suicidality we analysed each modality separately rather than selecting only
those children that had high-quality data across all three of the imaging modalities (Figure 1). A
detailed description of the acquisition protocols, quality control procedures, imaging processing,
and analyses of the ABCD study have been published elsewhere 43,52 and are summarized below.

Brain structural imaging: Following pre-processing, cortical reconstruction and volumetric
segmentation of structural datasets was conducted using FreeSurfer image analysis suite (version
5.3.0; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). For each individual, we considered FreeSurferderived regional cortical thickness measures (n=68) and regional subcortical volume measures
(n=18). Regional volumetric and cortical thickness measures were respectively adjusted for total
intracranial volume and mean cortical thickness.

Resting-state functional imaging: During collection of rs-fMRI data, children viewed a crosshair
for 20 minutes. To quantify connectivity strength during rs-fMRI, a seed-based correlational
approach was applied on parcellated regions 53-55. Using a functional atlas 53 we grouped the
cortical-surface regions into 12 predefined large-scaled networks: auditory, cingulo-opercular,
cingulo-parietal, default-mode, dorsal-attention, fronto-parietal, retrosplenial-temporal, salience,
sensorimotor-hand, sensorimotor-mouth, ventral-attention, and visual networks. We computed
functional connectivity estimates using Fisher r to z transformations of the mean correlations
between pairs of regions examined. Specifically, we computed the within-network functional
connectivity (n=12), the between-network functional connectivity (n=66) and the functional
connectivity between each network and 19 subcortical regions (n=228).

Task-based functional imaging: We examined activations evoked by three tasks: a modified
monetary incentive delay task (MID) 56, stop signal task (SST) 57 and emotional n-back task (ENback) 58,59, selected to probe reward processing, inhibitory control, and working memory,
respectively 43, with the latter also including affective processing. The processes underlying these
tasks have been implicated in suicidal behavior in clinical samples of older youth and adults
38,46-49,60-63

36-

. For each task, task-based changes in the blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal

were computed at the individual subject level using a general linear model (GLM) implemented
in AFNI's 3dDeconvolve 64. Average time courses were calculated for 167 regions-of-interest
(ROI) derived from the Freesurfer cortical parcellation (n=148)

65

and subcortical segmentation

(n=19) 66.

The MID task started with a cue, indicating possible earnings: large reward ($5), small reward
($0.20), no money ($0), small loss ($0.20), and large loss ($5). After a variable period following
the cue, the children were shown a brief target. To either earn reward or avoid loss, children
needed to respond before the target disappeared. Following the response, children saw the
outcome feedback of the trial. For the MID we considered measures derived from the following
contrasts: anticipation of large reward vs neutral condition (i.e, no gain or loss), anticipation of
large loss vs neutral condition, reward positive feedback vs reward negative feedback and loss
positive feedback vs loss negative feedback. For reward anticipation, we focused on large reward,
since it has been shown to maximize this process 67.

In the SST, each trial begins with the presentation of a leftward or rightward pointing arrow
(“Go” stimulus), and participants are instructed to indicate the direction of the arrow, responding

“as quickly and accurately as possible”. When the arrow is followed unpredictably by a “Stop
Signal” (an up-right arrow presented for 300 ms) participants are required to withhold or
interrupt the motor response to the “Go” stimulus. For the SST we considered measures derived
from the following contrasts that are relevant to inhibitory control: incorrect stop vs correct go
and correct stop vs correct go.

For the EN-back task, depending on the condition, children needed to respond whether the
stimulus was the same as (1) the one shown 2 trials earlier (2-back) or (2) the target stimulus
shown at the beginning (0-back). Stimuli included houses and emotional (happy or fearful) and
non-emotional faces. For the EN-back task we considered measures derived from the 2-back vs
0-back (i,e., sensorimotor control) contrast regardless of stimulus valence as an index of working
memory and measures derived from the contrast emotional vs neutral faces as an index of
emotional valence processing independent of working-memory.

Prior to statistical analysis, the structural and resting-state imaging variables were adjusted for
site/scanner effect using ComBat in R (https://github.com/Jfortin1/ComBatHarmonization) 68,69.
Initially used for batch adjustment of genetic data, ComBat uses Empirical Bayes to adjust for
between-site variability while preserving biological variability. We did not apply the ComBat
method on the task-based fMRI data because using within-individual contrasts alone in the
ABCD task-based fMRI data can mitigate scanner-related variance 69. Finally, for each
conducted test with resting-state and task-based fMRI measures, we calculated the interquartile
range (IQR) in order to remove outlier values that were above 1.5*IQR.

Statistical analysis
Analysis of individual and environmental characteristics
Group differences between never-suicidal children and those endorsing suicidality in continuous
variables were tested with Welch’s t-tests 70, to allow for unequal sample sizes. Difference in
rates of categorical variables were examined with chi-squared tests. Results were considered
significant at p<0.05 with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.

Analysis of neuroimaging data

The association between suicidality and imaging measures was examined using two
complementary approaches. We examined differences between groups endorsing suicidality and
the never-suicidal group with two-independent sample t-tests; we used Welch’s t-tests to account
for unequal number of observations. Of note, Welch’s t-test is a traditional null hypothesis
significance test, in which the null hypothesis is that the true effect size of the mean difference
between groups is zero. Whereas with this test one can conclude that the effect is statistically
different from zero if the null hypothesis is rejected, the absence of effect cannot be statistically
supported. That is, after performing the test, if the p-value is larger than the prespecified
threshold (e.g., 0.05), it is not possible to conclude that there is no effect or that the effect equals
zero. It might simply be that the study had not power enough to detect differences. Moreover,
regardless of whether a statistically significant effect is found or not, one might want to examine
whether such an effect is large enough to be deemed worthwhile. In these cases, one can examine
whether mean differences can be considered equivalent. For these reasons, and given the size of
the current study, we examine equivalence performing Welch’s Equivalence tests (hereafter,

Equivalence test). Equivalence testing has been successfully used in prior studies using the
ABCD cohort 71 as a safeguard against Type II errors (i.e., false negative results) and against
overinterpreting positive results that may arise in large samples despite group differences being
minimal (i.e., statistical overpowering) 72. In equivalence testing, the observed data are
statistically compared against a priori specified equivalence interval (δ), defined by upper (ΔU)
and lower (−ΔL) equivalence bounds. The aim of equivalence testing is to reject the null
hypothesis that the observed effect size is outside the equivalence bounds. Here, we used the
“two one-sided tests” (TOST) procedure 50,73 implemented with the TOSTtwo function from the
library TOSTER in R. The upper (ΔU) and lower (−ΔL) equivalence bounds were specified as
0.15 and -0.15, which correspond to traditional notions of a “small” effect size 74. Since nullhypothesis significant tests, such as Welch’s t-test, and equivalence tests examine two different
hypotheses, it is recommended to use both simultaneously 75.

In the Welch’s t-test, the null hypothesis is rejected when the confidence interval (CI) around the
effect size of the mean difference does not include zero; in this case, one can conclude difference
of means. In contrast, in the Equivalence test, the null hypothesis is rejected when the CI around
the effect size of the mean difference does not include the prespecified lower and upper bounds;
in this case, one can conclude equivalence of means. Therefore, when both null hypothesis
significance tests and equivalence tests are performed, there are four possible outcomes: 1) the
effect can be not statistically different from zero and statistically equivalent, 2) statistically
different from zero and statistically equivalent, 3) not statistically different from zero and not
statistically equivalent (i.e., undetermined), and 4) statistically different from zero and not
statistically equivalent. We provide results for each of these outcomes. The threshold for

statistical significance for both tests was set at p <0.05 after applying FDR-correction for
multiple comparisons.

Results
Sample
The four suicidality groups were composed as follows: child-reported suicidality (n=684, 8.6%),
caregiver-reported suicidality (n=654, 8.2%), concordantly-reported suicidality (n=198, 2.5%),
and never-suicidal (n=6,854, 85.7%). Among the participants with endorsed suicidality, either by
the child or the caregiver (n=1,140, 14.3%), there was an agreement of 17.4% (n=198). Table 1
shows the rate of suicidal behaviors reported by either the children or the caregivers and the rate
of positive agreement for each item. There was a predominance of passive and unspecific
suicidal ideation over active ideation, plans and suicidal attempts. Specifically, in the childreported suicidality group, 42% of participants only endorsed passive suicidal ideation, and 62%
of participants only endorsed passive or active nonspecific suicidal ideation. In the caregiverreported suicidality group, these rates were 49% and 80%, respectively. Overall, in the childreported suicidality group, suicidal ideation was endorsed by 8.4% of participants, plans were
endorsed by 0.9% of participants and attempts were endorsed by 1.3% of participants. In the
caregiver-suicidality group, these rates were 8.1%, 0.6%, 0.5% respectively.

Individual and environmental characteristics

Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics and comparison of individual and environmental
characteristics between the suicidality groups. Several variables differed at pFDR<0.05 between
the three suicidality groups and the never-suicidal group. Specifically, all suicidality groups
presented higher rate of males, higher exposure to stressful life events, more economic problems
in the last 12 months, more family conflict, less positive school environment and higher rates and
scores in every individual and parental clinical variable examined, including general

In addition, compared to the never-suicidal group, child- and parent-reported suicidality groups
presented higher rates of participants with multiple races, females with more advanced pubertal
development, and lower rates of caregiver living with partner. Finally, compared to the neversuicidal group, parent- and concordantly-reported suicidality groups had caregivers with higher
education.

Neuroimaging results

Figure 1 shows the sample size of the groups for each imaging modality analyzed. For each
modality, we first provide the combined results of applying traditional null-hypothesis Welch’s ttests and Equivalence test, after applying FDR-correction for multiple comparisons. These
results are depicted in Figure 2. Of note, none of the outcomes for any imaging modality was
statistically different and statistically equivalent, neither after FDR-correction nor at uncorrected
level. That is, any effects found were considered strong enough to be deemed worthwhile.

The results at uncorrected level are summarized in Supplementary Table S32, along with brain
measures that showed to be statistically different and not statistically equivalent across two or
more group comparisons.

Brain structural imaging: Among the 86 regions examined, only one showed to be statistically
different and not statistically equivalent after applying FDR-correction; specifically, the left bank
of the superior temporal sulcus was significantly thinner in the caregiver-reported suicidality
group than in the never-suicidal group (Figures 2-3, Supplementary Tables S2-S4). The
number of regions that showed to be not statistically different and statistically equivalent were 62
(72.1%) for the child-reported suicidality comparison, 76 (88.4%) for the caregiver-reported
suicidality comparison and 0 for the concordantly-reported suicidality comparison. No evidence
of both difference and equivalence (undetermined), was found for 24 (27.9%), 9 (10.5%), and 86
(100%) regions for child-, caregiver-, and concordantly-reported suicidality comparisons,
respectively (Figure 2, Supplementary Figures S1-S6).

Discussion

In a large US population-based sample of school-aged children we found that suicidality
endorsement was associated with higher levels of psychopathology and social adversity.
However, we found no robust evidence of brain correlates of suicidality using three distinct
neuroimaging modalities.

In this sample, we found that suicidality in children manifested mostly as passive or nonspecific
suicidal ideation. As expected, the rate of reported suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was
lower than in reports from community samples of adolescents and young adults 19-22,76; and more
in line with rates found in pre-pubertal and school-aged children 77,78. For example, the rate of
suicidal ideation and attempts was 8.9% and 1%, respectively, in a randomly selected sample of
children aged 9-10 years 77. It is important to note that the child and caregiver reports of
suicidality were not consistent. A similar observation has been made in adolescents and young
adults in whom non-disclosure mainly involved concerns about stigmatization, difficulties in
communication and unavailability of social and family support 79. Regardless of informant,
though, suicidality was associated with higher exposure to stressful life events, family conflict,
poor school environment, higher psychopathology in children and parents, maternal alcohol
and/or substance use during pregnancy, and parental history of depression and suicide attempt or
death 14,16,19-25,76. We also found that females with more advanced pubertal development, but not
males, displayed higher rates of suicidality, thus replicating previous findings in community
samples of youth 22.

In contrast to previous reports in clinical samples of adolescents34-42, we did not find evidence of
consistent or robust associations between suicidality and brain correlates in school-aged children
from the community, including measures of regional cortical thickness and subcortical volumes,
functional connectivity during rest, and task-based functional activations with contrasts
examining reward processing, inhibitory control, working memory, and emotion processing.
Very few results were statistically different at uncorrected level, and just one of them, out of
5,184 tests performed, survived correction for multiple comparisons. Specifically, the left bank
of the superior temporal sulcus was significantly thinner in the caregiver-reported suicidality
group than in the never-suicidal group. We further showed that the majority of group means were
equivalent (~67% for child-reported suicidality, ~51% for parent-reported suicidality), and those
means that were not statistically equivalent were still not statistically different between the two
groups after FDR-correction. The latter are considered undetermined results 50 and would need
further replication in other large samples of school-aged children.

The lack of differences between groups in the current study cannot be attributed to a lack of
power to detect differences given that size of the sample and the lack of case-control differences
that exceeded the small effect size (|0.15|) specified in the Equivalence tests. In this respect, our
findings are aligned to those reported in the largest meta-analysis to date examining subcortical
regions in MDD patients with and without suicidality 27. It is also unlikely that these results are
explained by the instrument used to detect suicidality since the groups endorsing such features
displayed all the well-established risk factors. We note, however, that the ABCD study was not
specifically designed to assess suicidality and the measures available do not provide information
about the frequency and persistence of suicidality. Moreover, very few ABCD participants had

active suicidal thoughts or behaviors at the time of scanning. In this sense, the current
investigation would be more accurately described as an attempt to define the neuroimaging
correlates of vulnerability to suicidality. Another possibility is that the paradigms employed to
examine suicidality correlates during MRI in the current study are not suicide-specific such as
the Implicit Association Test (IAT) 80. Nevertheless, our tasks and contrast are designed to
capture brain correlates associated with processes that have been linked to suicidality
conceptually and empirically. For instance, anhedonia, which is considered the underlying
symptom of impaired reward processing, is one of the best predictors of suicide

81,82

. Similarly,

deficits in executive functions such as inhibitory control and memory have also been linked to
suicidality83. It is important to note, though, that these associations have been reported mostly in
the context of depressive disorder, and in adult and adolescent samples 81-83. It is unclear, then,
whether this would apply to the general population and younger children.

Based on our results, vulnerability to suicidality in school-age children does not appear to have a
“brain signature” that could be used to enhance detection of this vulnerable group. However, this
does not imply that suicidality does not have brain correlates but indicates that such associations,
if any, are not discernible using macro-level imaging measures at this age. It is plausible that, as
brain organization evolves during the adolescent years, these suicidality correlates become more
evident, and even more after adolescence. Indeed, not all suicidality correlates found in adults
samples have been observed in adolescents samples, and it has been suggested that this is due to
differences in brain maturation 8. Yet, studies examining distinct developmental stages, either
cross-sectionally or longitudinally, are needed to answer this question. In that sense,
investigation of the longitudinal data from the ABCD cohort when they become available will

likely shed some light to these incongruent findings across samples of different ages. In addition
to longitudinal studies, other neuroimaging studies examining suicidality in school-aged
children, either in clinical or community-based samples, are needed to certify that “brain
signatures” of suicidality are not discernible at these young ages.

In conclusion, we leverage the size of the ABCD cohort to identify multimodal neuroimaging
correlates of vulnerability to suicidality in school-age children. We found that risk factors
relating to psychopathology and social adversity were present in children endorsing suicidality,
but we did not identify a discrete “brain signature” for vulnerability to suicidality. The
longitudinal design of the ABCD cohort presents an unprecedented resource for improving our
understanding of the evolution of suicidality and its neural correlates during development.
