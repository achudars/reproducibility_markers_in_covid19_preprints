ABSTRACT
Objective: Our study focused on identifying socioeconomic factors associated with death by
opioid overdose in Ohio communities at the census tract level.
Materials and Methods: A large-scale vital statistic dataset from Ohio Department of Health
(ODH) and U.S. Census datasets were used to obtain opioid-related death rate and
socioeconomic characteristics for all census tracts in Ohio. Regression analysis was performed to
identify the relationships between socioeconomic factors of census tracts and the opioid-related
death rate for both urban and rural tracts.
Results: In Ohio from 2010-2016, whites, males, and people aged 25-44 had the highest opioidrelated death rates. At the census tract level, higher death rates were associated with certain
socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. percentage of the census tract population living in urban
areas, percentage divorced/separated, percentage of vacant housing units). Predominately rural
areas had a different population composition than urban areas, and death rates in rural areas
exhibited fewer associations with socioeconomic characteristics.
Discussion: Predictive models of opioid-related death rates based on census tract-level
characteristics held for urban areas more than rural ones, reflecting the recently observed ruralto- urban geographic shift in opioid-related deaths. Future research is needed to examine the
geographic distribution of opioid abuse throughout Ohio and in other states.
Conclusion: Regression analysis identified associations between population characteristics and
opioid-related death rates of Ohio census tracts. These analyses can help government officials
and law official workers prevent, predict and combat opioid abuse at the community level.

INTRODUCTION
Opioids have been widely used to control and mitigate chronic and postoperative pain.
According to data published in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report in 2017, 130 people died each day from opioid-related drug
overdoses.[1] In 2017, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the opioid
epidemic a public health emergency.[2] Despite recommendations against the use of opioids,
during the past two decades, sharp increases in opioid prescriptions have resulted in opioid abuse
and accidental opioid overdoses. The rate of opioid prescriptions written has steadily decreased
since 2010, but the rate of drug overdose deaths involving any opioid continues to increase.[3, 4]
The increase of such opioid overdose deaths in 2016 was due to the use of heroin and synthetic
opioids other than methadone (such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl).[3, 4] While the United
States faces the most serious problems with opioid abuse and opioid-related deaths, opioid abuse
is an international issue, such as the trafficking of opioid painkillers for non-medical use in
Africa.[5]
To address the continuing opioid crisis, it is necessary to identify the characteristics of patients
who have used opioids over a long period of time and have died due to overdose. Several studies
have aimed to reveal the association between socioeconomic factors and opioid-related mortality.
Previous studies have revealed that poverty status and educational attainment could have an
effect on drug overdose and subsequent death.[6-10] One recent study investigated the existence
of a social gradient in fatal drug overdose cases related to non-prescribed opioids.[11] The
researchers found that the mortality rate of opioid and cocaine users from the lowest
socioeconomic group was 9.88 times higher than that of their peers of the highest socioeconomic
group. One study estimating associations between socioeconomic indicators and opioid-related
deaths for Orange County, California found that males, persons aged 45-54, and people
identifying as Caucasian had the highest rate of opioid mortality.[12] Additionally, the highest

death rates were seen in homeless adults. Another recent study revealed an association between
low income neighborhoods and increased risk of receiving an opioid treatment for back pain.[13]
Despite the existing research on the associations between socioeconomic factors and opioidrelated mortality, all associated socioeconomic factors have not yet been fully elucidated and
may vary from region to region, thus calling for more specific studies.
Recently, large-scale data sources related to opioid misuse have become publicly available,
although some require Data Use Agreements (DUAs) to access. We used a large-scale vital
statistic dataset from the ODH and U.S. Census datasets to perform retrospective and extensive
analysis at a statewide and Census tract level. Our study focused on Ohio, as opioid overdose and
abuse has become the most urgent public health issue facing Ohio. In 2017, Ohio had the second
highest rate of opioid-involved overdose death in the country, at 39.2 deaths per 100,000 persons
[14] compared to the national average of 14.9 per 100,000.[1]
The objective of this study is to reveal the socioeconomic factors of communities that are
significantly associated with increased opioid overdose-related mortality rates in Ohio at the
census tract level. We expect to produce useful analytic results to help government officials and
healthcare providers focus their efforts to solve the opioid epidemic.
METHODS
Data Description
With the exception of the rural/urban status, which was extracted from the 2010 Census,[15] all
data were obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS) for Ohio from 2010-2016.[16]
As a result, all variables changed over time using the updated ACS 5-year estimates, with the
exception of the percentage rural/urban status which was fixed across all study years using 2010
Census values. For the state of Ohio, we extracted overall population estimates as well as
population estimates by gender, age and race. For each census tract, we extracted the percentage
of the population with characteristics related to gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, marital

status, household occupancy, employment, poverty, income, health insurance, rural/urban status
and housing.
All data on opioid-related deaths were extracted from ODH mortality data containing decedent
information by opioid poisoning and misuse (2010-2016). We were approved to access limited
and identifiable data, completed the DUA, and de-identified decedent data. Access and use of the
data was approved by the ODH IRB. From the entire set of vital records containing information
on all deaths in Ohio, we selected only opioid-related records. We considered a death opioidrelated if the record had a positive value for any of the following nine indicators: Methadone,
opiates, prescription opiates, Fentanyl, Fentanyl and Analogues, Carfentanil, designer opioids,
commonly prescribed opioids, and/or other opioids. Then, we chose records for analysis which
contained positive values for “Opioid Related Death,” “Unintended Death,” “Undetermined
death,” and “Drug Poisoning Injury Mechanism.”
Analysis
We explored trends in the opioid-related death rate, calculated as the number of opioid deaths per
10,000 persons, between 2010 and 2016 by gender, age and race. We then compared the
distributions of gender, age and race among the entire Ohio population to the distributions
among those opioid fatalities. Chi-square goodness of fit tests were used to determine whether
the distribution of characteristics among the opioid fatalities were different than those of the
Ohio population.
We then aimed to explore the relationship between the extracted census tract characteristics and
the opioid-related death rate among Ohio census tracts using regression analysis. For the
purposes of the regression analysis, those census tracts with a population of zero were removed.
We first calculated descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) for all of the variables
considered for the regression analysis. We then explored the unadjusted relationships between
each variable and the opioid-related death rate using Poisson regression with the log of the

census tract population serving as the offset. We used a deviance adjustment to the scale
parameter for the unadjusted analysis due to slight overdispersion. Because the variables
selected for the regression analysis displayed a high degree of multicollinearity, we reduced the
number of variables for consideration in the multivariable regression model based on variance
inflation factors (VIF) < 5. To explore the relative importance of each category, multivariable
Poisson regression models with no adjustment to the scale parameter were fit using stepwise
model building and an alpha level of 0.05. The final set of variables used in the multivariable
model building are listed in Table 3. The regression analysis was performed separately for each
year, since we suspected that relationships between the census tract characteristics and the
opioid-related death rates may differ over time. The results for each year are presented overall,
as well as separately for mostly urban and mostly rural census tracts, because we also suspected
that the rural/urban classification would affect the factors associated with the opioid-related
death rates.
Results are reported as the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and can be
understood as the relative risk of death by opioid overdose in the given group, with a confidence
interval encompassing the value of 1 signifying nonsignificance.
We used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) to conduct the analyses.
RESULTS
Opioid-related death rates have increased over time in Ohio during 2010-2016. Rates are highest
among males as compared to females (Figure 1A), among persons aged 25-44 years followed by
45-54 years (Figure 1B), and among whites (Figure 1C).
These same groups also constitute a higher proportion of opioid deaths compared to that of the
general Ohio population, with a higher percentage of males (67.2% vs.48.9%, Figure 2A),
individuals 25-44 years and 45-54 years (52.6% vs. 25.1% and 24.3% vs. 14.6%, respectively,
Figure 2B), and whites (90.7% vs. 82.8%, Figure 2C).

In general, the distributions of the census tract characteristics appear similar over time
(Supplementary Table 1). On average, the census tract populations have a larger percentage of
females, persons aged 25-44 years, whites, persons with at least a high school degree, and
persons not married. On average, almost half of households have a single head, about a quarter
are living under 150% of the poverty level, and about 80% live in predominately urban areas.
The associations between the census tract characteristics and the opioid-related death rate varied
across the years, but certain patterns did emerge both prior to adjustment (Supplementary Table
2) and after adjustment for the variables in the multivariable models (Table 1).
After adjustment, an increase in the percentage of the population 54 years or younger was
associated with an increase in the death rate. Having an increase in the percentage of the
population 65 years and older was associated with a decrease in the death rate. Census tracts with
higher opioid-related death rates were also associated with a greater percentage of whites,
divorced/separated people, education levels up to high school completion, people living in urban
areas, male headed households with no female present, head of households living alone, and
vacant housing units. In 2016, for a 5% increase in the percentage of 45-54 year olds, the opioidrelated death rate was 1.19 (95% CI=1.12-1.26) times higher. In 2016, for a 5% increase in the
percentage of whites, the opioid-related death rate was 1.04 (95% CI=1.03-1.05) times higher;
for a 5% increase in the percentage without a high school diploma, 1.08 (95% CI=1.04-1.11); for
a 5% increase in the percentage with only a high school diploma, 1.03 (95% CI=1.01-1.06);
for a 5% increase in the percentage in urban areas, 1.04 (95% CI=1.03-1.05); for a 5% increase
in the percentage of male headed households with no female present, 1.10 (95% CI=1.03-1.18);
for a 5% increase in the percentage of head of households living alone, 1.08 (95% CI=1.061.10); and for a 5% increase in the percentage of vacant housing units, 1.07 (95% CI=1.04-1.10).
A higher median house value was associated with a lower opioid-related death rate; in 2016, the

Census tracts that were predominantly rural had, on average, a higher percentages of males,
whites, high school graduates (versus at least a bachelor’s degree), married persons, and owneroccupied homes, as well as higher median household incomes than compared to predominantly
urban census tracts (Supplementary Tables 3A-3B). Predominantly rural census tracts also had,
on average, a lower percentage of female headed households with no male present, households
headed by persons living alone, unemployed, households below 150% of the poverty level, and
households receiving public assistance or using food stamps. We found that the models of the
overall population characteristics against the opioid-related death rates showed few significant
associations with the predominantly rural areas prior to adjustment, while the results for the
predominantly urban areas more closely reflected the overall results (Supplementary Tables 4A4B). For the rural census tracts after adjustment, few characteristics were significantly associated
with changes in the opioid-related death rates. The only factors showing a rather consistent
association over time were the percentage of the population aged 25-54 and the percentage
divorced/separated, with both resulting in an increase in the death rate for a 5% increase in the
characteristic (Table 2A). However, the adjusted results for the urban census tracts were similar
to the overall adjusted results (Table 2B).

DISCUSSION
This study focused on the socioeconomic factors of Ohio census tracts and their association with
opioid-overdose related death rates from 2010 to 2016. Regression analysis was performed using
mortality data from the ODH and data extracted from the ACS for the state of Ohio.
Analysis of associations between changes in census tract socioeconomic factors and opioidrelated death rates in Ohio census tracts found that an increase in the death rate was associated
with an increase in the prevalence of the following census tract characteristics: percentage of the
population aged 25-55, percentage of whites, percentage of educational attainment less than or
equal to high school completion, percentage divorced/separated, percentage living in urban areas,
percentage of male-headed households without a female present, percentage of head of
households living alone, and the percentage of vacant housing units. A higher median house
value was associated with a lower death rate. These findings are interesting as they reflect the
increase of drug overdose deaths in urban areas compared to that of rural areas that was observed
in 2017.[17] While the increase in narcotic-related death rates for rural areas surpassed that of
urban areas between 1999-2004,[18] recent data shows higher death rates in urban counties.[17]
Our findings are also consistent with research that found a significant association between higher
numbers housing vacancies and higher rates of opioid-related death.[19]
These associations were found to hold for urban census tracts, while rural tracts did not show the
same associations, except for the percentage of the population aged 25-54 and the percent that
was divorced/separated. Thus, our research shows that the socioeconomic factors that predict
opioid-related deaths in urban populations do not hold for rural populations. While this
observation may be due to the more homogeneous makeup of rural areas or their smaller sample
size, it may also indicate the changing geographical patterns of opioid abuse. Census tract level
socioeconomic characteristics other than those that are presented here should be considered in

order to predict opioid abuse in rural tracts, in addition to researching which drugs are used more
widely in urban versus rural areas.
Limitations of this study include the exclusion of several variables from the multivariable model
building, as they exhibited multicollinearity. Additionally, the analysis is based on census-tract
level data and shows associations between community characteristics and community death rates
and does not explore personal risk factors for opioid-abuse related deaths. Finally, all variables
except the information about rural and urban communities came from the ACS and thus were
updated on an annual basis, while the rural and urban data came from the 2010 Census data and
is fixed for each year analyzed.
We suggest further research to analyze these associations with population data from other states
to verify if the model can be expanded beyond Ohio. Additionally, further research on the spatial
patterns of opioid-related deaths is needed to explore the incidence of opioid abuse in rural
versus urban locations.
CONCLUSION
The rate of opioid-related deaths has consistently increased in Ohio since 2010. The highest
death rates were associated with higher percentages of whites, males, and persons aged 25-54.
Our study revealed significant associations using regression analysis between population
characteristics of Ohio obtained from the American Community Survey for 2010-2016 and the
opioid-related death rate at the census tract level during these years. Census tracts with higher
death rates also exhibited higher percentages of the census tract population with educational
attainment less than or equal to high school completion, higher percentages of persons
divorced/separated, higher percentages in urban areas, higher percentages of male-headed
households without a female present, higher percentages with the head of household living alone,
and higher percentages of vacant housing units. These patterns found in the overall population
did not fit predominately rural populations, but results for predominately urban populations were

similar to those of Ohio’s overall population. Future studies should explore these patterns in
other states as well as analyze the geographic pattern of opioid misuse to better understand the
divergent patterns of opioid use in urban versus rural areas. Our research contributes to greater
understanding of predictors and patterns of opioid abuse, and will aid law enforcement agents,
emergency health services, and healthcare workers to combat the opioid crisis more effectively.
