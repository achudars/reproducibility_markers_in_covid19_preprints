Abstract
Background
The elimination programme for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India has seen great
progress, with total cases decreasing by over 80% since 2010 and many blocks now
reporting zero cases from year to year. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to
continue progress and avoid epidemics in the increasingly susceptible population.
Short-term forecasts could be used to highlight anomalies in incidence and support
health service logistics. The model which best fits the data is not necessarily most
useful for prediction, yet little empirical work has been done to investigate the balance
between fit and predictive performance.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We developed statistical models of monthly VL case counts at block level. By evaluating
a set of randomly-generated models, we found that fit and one-month-ahead prediction
were strongly correlated and that rolling updates to model parameters as data accrued
were not crucial for accurate prediction. The final model incorporated auto-regression
over four months, spatial correlation between neighbouring blocks, and seasonality.
Ninety-four percent of 10-90% prediction intervals from this model captured the
observed count during a 24-month test period. Comparison of one-, three- and
four-month-ahead predictions from the final model fit demonstrated that a longer time
horizon yielded only a small sacrifice in predictive power for the vast majority of blocks.

Conclusions/Significance
The model developed is informed by routinely-collected surveillance data as it
accumulates, and predictions are sufficiently accurate and precise to be useful. Such
forecasts could, for example, be used to guide stock requirements for rapid diagnostic
tests and drugs. More comprehensive data on factors thought to influence geographic
variation in VL burden could be incorporated, and might better explain the
heterogeneity between blocks and improve uniformity of predictive performance.
Integration of the approach in the management of the VL programme would be an
important step to ensuring continued successful control.

Author summary
This paper demonstrates a statistical modelling approach for forecasting of monthly
visceral leishmaniasis (VL) incidence at block level in India, which could be used to
tailor control efforts according to local estimates and monitor deviations from the
currently decreasing trend. By fitting a variety of models to four years of historical data
and assessing predictions within a further 24-month test period, we found that the
model which best fit the observed data also showed the best predictive performance,
and predictive accuracy was maintained when making rolling predictions up to four
months ahead of the observed data. Since there is a two-month delay between reporting

and processing of the data, predictive power more than three months ahead of current
data is crucial to make forecasts which can feasibly be acted upon. Some heterogeneity
remains in predictive power across the study region which could potentially be improved
using unit-specific data on factors believed to be associated with reported VL incidence
(e.g. age distribution, socio-economic status and climate).

Introduction

Visceral leishmaniasis in India

2

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the acute disease caused by Leishmania donovani, which

3

is transmitted through infected female Phlebotomus argentipes sandflies. In India, the

4

burden of disease is largely contained within the four northeastern states of Bihar,

5

Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, with the rural state of Bihar most broadly

6

affected [1–3].

7

Incidence of VL in India has decreased substantially since the initiation of the

8

regional Kala-Azar Elimination Programme (KEP), which aims to tackle the disease

9

across the Indian subcontinent through enhanced case detection and treatment and

10

reduction of vector density [4]. As a result, reported cases have fallen from 29,000 in

11

2010 to less than 5,000 in 2018 [3, 4]. The overall target of the programme is to reduce

12

incidence to less than 1 case/10,000 people/year within each “block”. Blocks are

13

administrative sub-divisions of a district with population sizes varying from twenty

14

thousand to several million, depending on geographic area and the proportion of urban

15

and rural habitation. As a consequence, the target equates to an absolute total of

16

between three and two hundred cases per year. To support the elimination effort, data

17

are reported to a central repository (Kala-Azar Management Information System,

18

KA-MIS) to construct line lists including the date and location of every diagnosed case.

19

Despite the overall decrease in incidence, there is considerable heterogeneity between

20

blocks (Fig. 1). In some blocks cases are now few and far between, while others remain

21

substantially affected from year to year. The combination of the decrease and the

22

heterogeneity raises the need for a more targeted approach; the finite resources available

23

must be distributed efficiently to continue progress. Additionally, history has shown

that VL has the potential to develop into large epidemics [5–7] and hence it is

25

important that localised pockets of incidence are not overlooked. Intervention when

26

incidence is low is required to prevent the trajectory from turning upwards again, as

27

cycles of VL incidence appear to occur with a frequency of 10-20 years [8].

28

Fig 1. Estimated incidence per 10,000 population per block in 2018, for
Bihar and the four endemic districts of Jharkhand (Dumka, Godda,
Sahibganj and Pakur). Incidence is estimated according to reported cases in
KA-MIS with diagnosis date in between 01/01/2018 and 31/12/2018 and block
populations projected from the 2011 census according to decadal, block-level growth
rates [9]. Black lines indicate block boundaries. The affected blocks of Jharkhand on
average have much higher incidence than Bihar and can be seen in the bottom right of
the map. Blocks marked grey had no reported cases during the study period.
The primary aim of this paper is to demonstrate a methodology for providing

29

short-term, block-level predictions of VL cases for two purposes. First, as a prediction

30

tool to support logistics, for example to set minimum stock levels of rapid diagnostic

31

tests and drugs. Second, to provide an early warning if the number of cases starts to

32

resurge. For such a framework to be useful to the elimination programme, it is essential

33

that its predictions are sufficiently accurate. Hence we make predictive accuracy of the

34

forecasting approach the focus of the model selection. We believe that this is a critical

35

step in the effort to maintain the successes of the current programme, and as a

36

foundation for improved disease control.

37

38

Spatio-temporal analysis

Epidemiological data, in particular regarding infectious disease, are often spatially and

39

temporally correlated. This simply means that incidence in one area is related to

40

incidence in nearby areas, and incidence at one point in time is related to incidence in

41

the past. Mapping VL incidence at the block level highlights spatial correlation (Fig. 1),

42

with concentrated regions of high incidence appearing in East Bihar and Jharkhand.

43

This could be due to similar geographic and demographic characteristics of

44

neighbouring blocks, or the spread of infection by regular population movement. The

45

latter can induce a spatio-temporal pattern in which pockets of high incidence appear to

46

“step” between neighbouring blocks. The seasonal cycle of incidence and overall

47

decreasing trend (Fig. 2) are clearly evident in aggregated case counts.

48

Several statistical approaches have been developed to model count data in space and

aggregate level.

time. These methods have been largely developed and used for understanding the

50

drivers of patterns, often incorporating additional covariate information describing

51

climate, geography or demography [10]. Where aetiology is not the focus, analyses often

52

incorporate GIS data to identify hotspots and predict disease spread at a local village or

53

household level [11]. In the case of VL on the Indian subcontinent, the KA-MIS system

54

grants us reliable and near-complete date and location data for notified cases over the

55

past six years. However, on this scale, GIS data are not yet available, covariate data

56

beyond crude population estimates are sparse and time-varying information even harder

57

to come by. As such, statistical approaches to spatio-temporal analysis have been

58

broadly limited to specific study regions within which additional data were

59

collected [12]. Predictions on a regional level have so far been the remit of transmission

60

dynamic modelling [13]. We aim to make use of the available data for the whole state of

61

Bihar and the affected region of Jharkhand, focussing our attention on prediction and

62

not aetiology and building our approach purely from the spatial and temporal

63

correlations of case counts.

64

Often the model which best fits observed data is selected for forecasting, yet

65

goodness of fit does not guarantee predictive power. We therefore also investigate the

66

relationship between the fit and predictive power.

67

68

Model Framework

A natural modelling approach is to consider the cases in each month in each block as a

69

function of cases in the previous month and in neighbouring blocks. A model framework

70

has been developed in [14, 15] which decomposes the distribution of counts at each point

71

in space and time into three components (auto-regressive, neighbourhood and endemic):

72

• Auto-regressive (AR) The contribution of previous incidence in the same block
to current incidence. A choice must be made about time period of previous

74

incidence considered (i.e. the number of months).

75

• Neighbourhood (NE) The contribution of previous incidence in surrounding

blocks to current incidence. A choice must be made about both the time period and

77

spatial extent considered (i.e. neighbours, neighbours of neighbours etc.), with

78

indirect neighbours assigned decaying weights, for example, according to a power

79

law.

80

• Endemic (END) A function describing the intrinsic incidence related to block
factors (such as geography or demography) or seasonality.

82

The sum of these components forms the mean structure for a negative binomial

83

distribution used to model the count in each block and month. The epidemic

84

component consists of both auto-regression and spatial/spatio-temporal regression. The

85

maximum distance in space or time at which we assume one block-and-month count

86

affects another is referred to as the maximum spatial or temporal lag. The endemic

87

component attempts to explain any remaining variation, potentially due to overall

88

temporal trends, population size and other unit-specific factors.

89

In addition to the genuine epidemiology of VL, there is an intermediary process of

October 21, 2019

81

90

detection and reporting which contributes to the distribution of case counts. A new case

91

in a previously unaffected area triggers active case detection (ACD) which continues for

92

twelve months, therefore contributing to the pattern of temporal correlation. In other

93

words, one case is likely to be promptly followed by more cases - not only because of

94

transmission but also as a result of increased, localised detection effort. We therefore

95

explored a flexible, distributed lag structure [16] which extends the range of

96

spatio-temporal interaction by allowing incidence over multiple previous months to

97

contribute to both the auto-regressive and spatial elements. The selection of an optimal

98

lag length has been investigated for distributed lag models in one dimension (i.e. time

99

alone) [17], but the impact of introducing a spatial component has not been thoroughly

100

discussed. A strong interdependence between the autoregressive and neighbourhood

101

components is introduced by simultaneously incorporating past information from the

102

same block and the neighbourhood of that block in a distributed lag model; each block

103

affects subsequent incidence in its neighbours, which in turn affects subsequent

104

incidence in the original block. We apply a systematic approach which attempts to

105

optimise the temporal and spatial lags simultaneously such that one does not mask the

106

effect of the other.

1.4

Evaluation of forecasts

108

The three components described in the previous section have arbitrary complexity and

109

lead to a large number of candidate models. A key issue is therefore to identify the

110

best-fitting model, or a set of well-fitting models, and to assess to which degree good

111

in-sample (or retrodiction) performance translates to out-of-sample forecasting

112

performance. In-sample performance is widely assessed via the Akaike information

113

criterion (AIC). The AIC balances the model fit and complexity, and has been

114

recommended for model selection for prediction purposes [18]. To assess predictive

115

performance it is common to use proper scoring rules [19]. These measure

116

simultaneously calibration and sharpness of forecast distributions, where sharpness

117

describes the concentration of the predictive distribution and calibration describes the

118

statistical consistency between forecasts and observations. An ideal forecast maximizes

119

sharpness subject to calibration [20]. We use the ranked probability score (RPS) [19]

120

averaged over all blocks and predicted months, which for a predictive distribution P

121

and an observation x is defined as

122

RPS(P, x) =

∞
X

[FP (k) − 1(x ≤ k)]2

(1)

k=0

Here, FP is the cumulative distribution function of P and 1 is the indicator function.

123

The RPS thus compares the cumulative distribution function of P to that of an “ideal”

124

forecast with all probability mass assigned to the observed outcome x. We use this score

125

rather than the logarithmic score as it is considered more robust [20], and we wish to

126

assign some credit to forecasts near the observed value. The score is negatively oriented,

127

meaning that smaller values are better.

128

Calibration can in addition be assessed using probability integral transform (PIT)
histograms. The PIT histogram shows the empirical distribution of FP ;i(xi ) for a set of

130

independent forecasts i = 1, ..., I. We here use an adapted version for count data

131

suggested by Czado et al [19]. If the forecasts are calibrated, the histogram should be

132

approximately uniform. U and inverse U-shaped PIT histograms indicate that the

133

forecasts imply too little or too much variability, respectively.

134

A closely-related summary measure which is easy to communicate are empirical
coverage probabilities [20]. We will provide coverage probabilities of central 50% and

80% prediction intervals (reaching from the 25% to 75% and 10% to the 90% quantiles

137

of the predictive distribution, respectively). For a calibrated forecast, the empirical

138

coverage probabilities should be close to the nominal levels. However, in the context of

139

sparse, low counts the discreteness of the data often prevents achieving exactly the

140

nominal coverage level. Prediction intervals can then either be slightly conservative (too

141

high coverage), which is usually preferred in practice, or slightly liberal. Initially, we

142

examine and discuss the relationship between model complexity, its ability to describe

143

past data (i.e. its fit) and its ability to predict the next month. We then apply this

144

understanding to systematically select an optimal model for prediction, before

145

comparing its predictive ability for different time horizons.

Materials and methods

2.1

Data

148

Access to the KA-MIS database of VL cases was provided by the National Vector Borne

149

Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) and facilitated by CARE India. Individual case

150

records were downloaded for Bihar and Jharkhand, restricted to diagnosis date between

151

01/01/2013 and 31/12/2018 and then aggregated by block and diagnosis month. This

152

gave reported case counts for 441 blocks. The KA-MIS data were merged with data

153

from the 2011 census [9] (compiled by CARE India) for the two states to produce the

154

final data set, including endemic blocks which had no reported cases during the study

155

period and hence did not appear in KA-MIS. Because we incorporate spatial correlation

156

into the model, it is necessary to not have “holes” of missing data in the map. For

157

individual blocks within the assumed “endemic” region without any reported cases in

158

certain months, case counts were assumed to be “true zeros” since detection efforts

159

should be consistent with the affected neighbouring blocks. The time series for these

160

blocks were imputed with zeros and therefore contributed to the fit of the model. Four

161

entire districts of Bihar, at the edge of the “endemic” region, (Gaya, Jamui, Kaimur and

162

Rohtas) had no reported cases during the period, and were excluded from the analysis.

163

The final analysis data set included 502 blocks across 38 districts of Bihar and

164

Jharkhand over 72 months.

2.2

Model Structure

166

Due to considerable temporal variation in incidence within blocks, as a result of

167

detection effort and cases arising in “clumps”, the block-level monthly case counts are

168

widely dispersed. A negative binomial distribution was therefore used to model the

169

block-level case counts throughout.

170

All models fitted conform to the same negative binomial structure for case counts Yit

Investigating fit and prediction

186

Thirty random models were drawn from the set of possible formulations (where all three

187

of the endemic-epidemic components are included in some form) and compared on the

188

metrics of interest. This informed the subsequent selection process for the final

189

prediction model.

190

Code used to produce the results in this paper is available from

191

https://github.com/esnightingale/VL_prediction_paper, along with a simulated

192

version of the dataset from the final selected model.

193

2.3

194

Model selection

During the selection process, all models were fit to the subset of months 5 to 48 in order

195

to make comparisons between temporal lags up to four months. The remaining 24

196

months were then predicted sequentially in a “one-step-ahead” (OSA) approach to

197

assess predictive power, either with rolling updates to the fit (incorporating each

198

month’s data into parameter estimates to predict the next) or without (using only the

199

training set of data for all predictions) [19]. The RPS of these predictions was compared

200

to the AIC from the training period fit to assess the relationship between fit to the

201

“observed” data and future prediction.

202

Starting with a basic, endemic-only model (including a population offset and linear

October 21, 2019

203

trend in time), potential extensions of the three core components were added in turn

204

and measures of fit and predictive power were calculated. The addition which yielded

205

the best improvement in the RPS of OSA predictions, subject to calibration (p not less

206

than 0.1 for test of calibration based on RPS), was selected and then all remaining

207

options tested again. This process was repeated until no further extension of the model

208

made a significant (p ¡ 0.001) improvement to predictive power (as determined by a

209

permutation test on the RPS). This stringent criterium was employed in order to

210

prioritise simplicity over complexity. If at any point an individual model parameter lost

211

significance, the element associated with this parameter was removed in subsequent

212

models.

The following elements were considered for inclusion:

214

• Log of population density as an offset in the endemic component, in place of

215

population fraction.

216

• Seasonality and linear trend in all three components.

217

• Distributed temporal lags up to 4 months, with decaying weights according to a

218

geometric distribution.

219

• Spatial lags up to maximum of 7th order neighbours, with weights decaying

220

according to a power law (wij = o−d
ij , where oij is the neighbourhood order of

221

blocks i and j, and the decay exponent d is to be estimated).

222

• Intercept of log population density in the neighbourhood component (Gravity

223

Law ), to reflect that blocks of high population density are more strongly

224

influenced by their neighbours due to migration.

225

• District and state-specific dispersion, allowing the variation in incidence to differ
between spatial units.

227

It was not feasible to allow a block-specific dispersion parameter since many blocks

228

had too few cases to obtain stable estimates.

229

2.3.1

230

Empirical Coverage Probabilities

Again using a one-step-ahead approach, the 25th and 75th quantiles of the predicted

231

distribution were calculated and a score of 0 or 1 assigned if the observed value fell

232

inside or outside this quantile range respectively. This binary score was assigned for

233

each block and each month in the test set, such that we could subsequently calculate a

234

proportion of prediction intervals which did not capture the true count. Thus, the

235

overall score, C, is given by

236

C=

1 X
1[yit ≤ qi,t,0.25 |yit ≥ qi,t,0.75 ]
ni nt i,t

(8)

where yit is the observed count for block i at month t, ni and nt the total number of
blocks and months respectively, and qi,t,p the pth quantile of the predicted distribution.

For an ideal forecast this score will match the nominal level. We also investigated such a

239

score using 10th and 90th quantiles, to ascertain whether these could be used as

240

approximate lower and upper bounds for case counts.

242

For the final model, further predictions were calculated based on a rolling window of

243

three and four months. As with the rolling OSA approach, the model was initially fit to

244

the training set (months 1, . . . , t) and this fit used to predict month t + 3. The model

245

was then updated with the data from t + 1 in order to predict t + 4, and so on. The

246

RPS of one, three and four month ahead predictions were compared to assess the loss in

247

accuracy with a longer time horizon.

Dispersion

251

District-specific dispersion parameters were investigated, but ultimately not considered

252

a viable option to be included in the model. Four districts in particular (Aurangabad,

253

Banka, Jehanabad and Nawada) demonstrate extended periods of zero incidence with

254

occasional sporadic cases or large spikes, which lead to very large dispersion estimates

255

for these districts and therefore unrealistically high predictions. See S1 Fig for an

256

illustration of these patterns. Due to the neighbourhood effect, these high predictions in

257

turn influence the predictions of any bordering blocks. Changes in detection effort could

258

go some way to explaining these unusual patterns, however it is also likely that such

259

patterns will become more common as elimination is approached. This suggests that an

260

alternative modelling strategy will become necessary as cases become more sparse in

261

space and time.

Distributed temporal lags

By sequentially adding further distributed lags to the best-fitting single-lagged model,

264

neither a clear minimum nor an “elbow” in RPS was attained up to twelve months. The

October 21, 2019

weights assigned to each lag did not show a rapid “drop-off” as a result of a high

266

estimated decay parameter, and months substantially far back in time were still

267

assigned non-negligible weight. PIT histograms of predictions from these lagged models

268

are included in 4. We found that adding higher orders of distributed lags consistently

269

improved both predictive power and fit. This appears to contradict analysis of

270

individual block time series which suggested significant auto-correlation no more than

271

four months back in time. In the current form of “hhh4addon”, it is not possible to

272

specify a different temporal lag length within the AR and NE components (for example,

273

to incorporate neighbouring incidence from further back in time than within-block).

274

Therefore, the contribution of distributed lags to both components had to be considered

275

and a balance had to be drawn. Comparing the PIT histograms of solely auto-regressive

276

models, the very highest counts are vastly underestimated for all lag lengths. Since the

277

highest values in each block often reflect sudden jumps they cannot be captured by

278

auto-regression; more information - potentially from the surrounding area - is required

279

to anticipate them. Models with no auto-regression but which incorporate neighbouring

280

incidence are better able to reach the highest counts but in doing so over-estimate the

281

moderate-to-high range. It was concluded that beyond four months of lags the

282

improvement in prediction was small enough to discount, and much longer lags were

283

difficult to justify epidemiologically. Therefore only four months of lags were considered

284

for the final model.

285

286

Random model assessment

According to the thirty random models drawn, fit and prediction were found to be

287

strongly correlated (Fig. 3A). Predictions were calculated based on either a rolling fit

288

(incorporating each month’s data into parameter estimates to predict the next month)

289

or fixed fit (using parameters fit to the training set only for all predictions). The scores

290

for both prediction approaches were very similar for most models, suggesting that the

291

processes defined in these models are consistent over time and hence the quality of

292

prediction does not depend on regular model updates (Fig. 3B). This is noteworthy

293

since in practice it may not be possible to update the fits on such a regular basis.

294

Selecting the model based on RPS of predictions from a fixed model fit would best

295

reflect the constraints of reality and be the more conservative approach.

Fig 3. Comparison of predictive performance and model fit, and predictive performance for training period
fit and rolling fit updates, for models with randomly selected components. (A) AIC versus RPS for 30 randomly
selected models. AIC is calculated from the fit to the training period only (months 13 to 48) and RPS from one-step-ahead
predictions (months 49 to 72) based on the same fit. According to this random sample, fit and prediction are strongly
correlated; the model which fits best to the observed data produces the best one-step-ahead predictions. (B) RPS of
predictions based on the fixed training set fit versus rolling fit updates. Predictive power is very similar between the two

3.2

Systematic model selection

297

As was found with the random model set, the systematically selected model which

298

demonstrated the highest predictive power as measured by RPS also achieved the

299

closest fit to existing data. Initially, no more than two distributed AR lags could be

300

added to the model without yielding evidence of miscalibration in the predictions.

301

However, once the neighbourhood component was added in the third stage of selection,

302

increasing the AR lags to four months significantly improved both AIC and RPS with

303

no evidence of miscalibration. At this point the endemic linear trend lost significance

304

and therefore was removed in subsequent models. The AIC, RPS and empirical

305

coverage probabilities for all models considered in the selection process are shown in Fig.

306

307

and PIT histograms compared in Fig. 5.

308

Fig 4. Measures of fit and predictive power throughout the model selection
process. Figures illustrate the models tested in chronological order from left to right,
with each stage indicated by a different colour. Models were selected at each stage
based on the biggest reduction in RPS, subject to calibration; these are identified by
hollow points, and the final selected model by a star. For the two variants on the
coverage probability, average quantile interval width (representing uncertainty in the
predicted case count) is shown on the right axis and by the grey dashed line. Interval
width is determined by the count at the upper quantile minus the count at the lower,
hence an interval width of two covers three possible count values (e.g. 2, 3, 4).

final model. Model 52 offered minor improvement in RPS with additional complexity.

October 21, 2019

An empirical coverage probability cannot be considered “strictly proper” [15, 19, 20],

309

as the RPS score is, and hence does not favour sharpness in addition to calibration. By

310

tightening the predicted distribution and hence tightening the interval in absolute terms,

311

the chance of capturing the observed value in that interval is lessened. Moreover, with

312

very low counts across the majority of the region, the interval from 25-75% often consists

of only a single value. It would be more interpretable to simply report the median.

314

We found that as RPS and AIC were improved, the empirical coverage probabilities

315

of prediction intervals were increased far beyond their nominal level. With the final

316

model (Model no. 42), only 5.4% (652/12048) of observations fell outside the 10-90%

317

interval, with an average interval width of just three possible case counts. This

318

predicted distribution is much more conservative in its coverage than a simple linear

319

trend model (coverage 10-90% = 0.905) but attains substantially better fit and RPS,

320

suggesting that more of the improvement comes in the form of calibration. The

321

conservative 90% predicted quantile provides a reliable upper limit for the next month’s

322

incidence, to which a management plan could be defined accordingly.

The model fit is dominated by auto-regression; the majority of information with

329

which to predict the current month comes from incidence in the previous four months.

330

Since the contribution of each component is modelled on a log scale these parameters

331

have a multiplicative effect, hence the range of the seasonal AR component (approx.

332

[0.6, 0.8]; see Fig. 6) indicates that each month’s count is expected to be a certain

333

fraction of the weighted average of the counts over the last four months. This occurs

334

over all blocks and therefore amounts to an overall decreasing trend. After accounting

335

for auto-regression, it was found that the neighbourhood effect did not extend beyond

336

directly bordering blocks with respect to prediction. Seasonality within this component

also serves to vary the magnitude of the effect throughout the year.

338

Fig 6. Fitted seasonal waves in the auto-regressive (AR) and
neighbourhood (NE) model components. Both reflect the first-quarter peak in
reported cases but the magnitude of the waves differs, with the contribution of the AR
component varying more than that of the NE.

The contribution of an endemic trend was found to be negligible, reflecting the lack

339

of homogeneity across blocks, and was therefore not included; the reduction in total

340

incidence comes entirely from each block’s autoregressive pattern. Block-specific

341

covariate data (e.g. relating to socio-economic or geographic features of the area) would

342

contribute to this component and potentially reveal associations which are consistent

343

across blocks. Random intercepts were tested in the endemic component to capture

344

unexplained block variation, yet did not improve predictive power in a basic model and

345

caused convergence issues in more complex, distributed-lag models.

346

The relative contributions of the three model components are illustrated for the four

347

blocks with highest average monthly incidence (Gopikandar, Kathikund, Boarijor and

348

Sundarpahari) in Fig. 7.

of the endemic component is negligible therefore barely visible. The fitted value from

Predictive performance

350

The final model achieved an overall RPS of 0.420, with individual block-wise averages

351

ranging from 4.3 × 10−5 to 3.47. The histogram in Fig. 8 demonstrates that the final

352

model is able to predict accurately and sharply across the majority of the region, yet

353

there is a small subset of blocks with more widely varying RPS. It should be noted that

354

the overall performance of the model is strongly influenced by blocks with almost no

355

incidence as these yield the very lowest scores. Similarly, there is some correlation

356

between the blocks for which the model performs least well, and the blocks which have

357

historically demonstrated the highest average incidence since higher counts are harder

358

to predict than zeros or single cases. The blocks with the highest RPS also tend to

Pakur, Maheshpur, Boarijor and Sundarpahari in Jharkhand (RPS = 3.47, 2.70, 2.58

364

and 2.58, resp.) experienced substantial jumps in incidence between May and July 2017,

365

constituting differences of up to 27 cases from one month to the next. Paroo (RPS =

366

3.07) showed a particularly erratic pattern of cases within the test period, with spikes of

367

21 and 19 cases separated by a few months of ∼5 cases and a subsequent fall to just one

368

case by December 2018. Incidence in Garkha has also been inconsistent and appeared to

369

have been on the rise in recent years, until a similar fall at the end of 2018. It should be

370

noted that additional case detection efforts in Jharkhand at the start of 2017 will likely

371

have contributed substantially to the observed spikes at this time.

372

This highlights a limitation of fitting such a model over a large number of highly

October 21, 2019

373

heterogeneous units with minimal unit-specific information. Model selection was

374

performed based on an average score over all blocks and time points for which

375

predictions were made; a model is therefore chosen which predicts well overall, but in

376

doing so sacrifices predictive power for a minority of blocks which do not follow the

377

general trend. Zero counts dominate over all time and space, and the variance of the

378

negative binomial distribution with a universal dispersion parameter is still too

379

restrictive to account for blocks with the highest counts. It is in these areas where

380

additional information on potential predictors of incidence could prove most valuable.

384

substantial loss in predictive power, with block-wise RPS very similar for the majority

385

of blocks. When compared over the same predicted months, the differences in RPS

between one-month-ahead prediction and three-/four-month-ahead were found to be

Discussion

397

We have presented the evaluation of a predictive model of VL in Bihar and four

398

endemic districts in Jharkhand. We have empirically investigated the performance of

399

different models on prediction performance rather than model fit and produced a

400

statistical model that is capable of accurate forecasting. To the best of our knowledge,

401

this is the first time the spatio-temporal correlation of incidence at block level across all

402

the endemic districts of Bihar and Jharkhand has been quantified. Methods such as

403

these can be an important tool for management of endemic diseases.

404

Given the lack of an effective vaccine and evidence that indoor residual spraying of

October 21, 2019

405

insecticide fails to significantly reduce sandfly densities and VL incidence in sprayed

406

villages [24, 25], rapid diagnosis and treatment is currently our best method of control.

With a block-level estimate of the likely number of cases to arise over the next few

408

months, local management teams could take steps to ensure they are prepared. For

409

example, the 90% quantile of the predicted distribution could be used to inform

410

block-specific minimum stock levels for drugs.

411

In practice, the prediction interval is constrained by the efficiency of the reporting
process; the time taken to process diagnosis reports and input the information into the

413

database sets a minimum horizon at which predictions would be genuinely prospective

414

and therefore of practical use. In this paper we have assumed a delay of two months

415

until a month’s data can be considered complete, which would necessitate making

416

predictions at least three months ahead of that point. However, conservative predictions

417

based on preliminary month totals would still likely be of use to the programme.

418

We have demonstrated here that rolling three-month-ahead predictions are a

419

reasonable approximation to one-month-ahead, but confidence is sacrificed for a

420

minority of blocks as the time horizon is increased. There is a need for discussion with

421

local disease management teams to determine the optimal balance between practicality

422

and uncertainty. Moreover, the way in which we quantify the accuracy and utility of

423

predictions would benefit from some public health insight; it is highly likely that over-

424

and under-estimation would need to be weighted differently, which may alter which

425

model is deemed preferable. Ideally, the model structure would have been optimised

426

according to predictive power on this slightly longer time horizon, but this is not a

427

trivial task and was deemed beyond the scope of this paper.

428

There are also potential issues with movement of VL cases across international

429

borders; in particular, the international boundary with Nepal cuts through a VL

430

endemic area, artificially removing some aspects of spatial correlation. Ideally, we would

431

take a regional perspective and also include areas in neighbouring states that have some

432

more sporadic VL reporting.

433

It could be argued that the block-level is too coarse a spatial scale for modelling the

October 21, 2019

412

434

spread of an infectious disease. Outbreaks of VL occur on a smaller spatial and

435

temporal scale than has been applied here, therefore cannot be anticipated by this

436

model. The transmission dynamic models which are usually employed for this type of

437

problem can be defined on a village, household or even individual level [26], yet this

438

more detailed picture demands many more assumptions which are difficult to justify in

this context. The sparseness of cases at this point in the elimination process also means

440

that aggregation at a finer temporal scale might lead to issues with parameter

441

estimation. The block is the unit at which control efforts are co-ordinated, disease

442

burden is monitored, and control targets are set, therefore predictions at this level could

443

prove to be a worthwhile compromise while more realistic transmission models are out

444

of reach. With more detailed location data, the spread of disease can be modelled as a

445

point process at the village or household level, potentially giving insight into the size

446

and movement of disease clusters or “hot-spots” over time. This technique has

447

previously been applied to the case of VL [27] and may be possible to extend to a larger

448

study region in the near future, following a recent effort to collect GPS co-ordinates of

449

affected villages across Bihar.

450

In this case the best-fitting model was found to be the best-predicting model. The

October 21, 2019

451

similarity of prediction and fitting results perhaps reflects the continuity of the

452

processes creating the data. However, consideration of predictive power across the whole

453

range of possible values was key to determining an optimal temporal lag length for

454

short-term prediction. Fit and overall predictive power favoured a high number of lags

455

in order to best capture the spatio-temporal correlation between neighbouring block

456

counts, which appears to contribute to prediction of sudden changes in incidence.

457

However, auto-regression is the dominant model component and appears to be captured

458

by lags up to four months. It would be preferable to specify a different lag length for

459

the auto-regressive and spatial components but this is not currently implemented in the

460

surveillance framework. By inspection of PIT histograms, we were able to select the lag

461

length which balanced overall predictive power with capacity to predict at the upper

462

end of the range.

463

The model selection approach taken in this analysis is pseudo-systematic; it was not

464

feasible to assess every possible combination of model components. Therefore we aimed

465

to home in on a suitable model by adding components which gave the biggest

466

improvement in predictive performance out of a range of likely options. It was found

467

that once the major components were included in some form, further adjustment largely

468

had the effect of redistributing the variation attributed to each component and did not

469

substantially alter fit or prediction. There is only so much information within the time

470

series of cases to feed the model, so predictive power quickly reaches a limit.

The model presented here aims to demonstrate the best that can be done with the
minimal information routinely collected by the current programme, but there is

473

evidence that this model still cannot fully account for the heterogeneity in incidence

474

across the region. The lack of geographic and/or demographic covariates beyond

475

population size means that the endemic component in this model is negligible; almost

476

all our information comes from the spatio-temporal correlations, underlining the need

477

for up-to-date data in order to make accurate predictions. Associations between VL

478

incidence and, for example, age and socio-economic quintiles have been

479

demonstrated [12, 28], which may give rise to varied endemic patterns at the block level.

480

This unknown variation could in theory be quantified by random effects within this

481

model framework, but convergence issues (likely due to the large number of zero-counts)

482

made this infeasible in practice.

483

The variation in case counts may be better explained by a zero-inflated process, and

October 21, 2019

472

484

the extent of zero-inflation will likely become more prominent as elimination is

485

approached. Bayesian hierarchical models can be used to distinguish sources of

486

variation at different levels and have the benefit of accommodating any informal or

487

incomplete understanding of the transmission process within prior distributions for

488

model parameters. These models have until recently been commonly implemented using

489

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [29], which is computationally intensive for data

490

rich in both space and time. They are however becoming increasingly accessible as a

491

tool for inference and prediction, thanks to user-friendly wrappers which take advantage

492

of fast computation using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) [30]. We

493

hope to explore this approach in future work.

494

Conclusion

495

We have demonstrated a framework for forecasting VL incidence at subdistrict level in

496

India which achieves good predictive performance based on the available routinely

497

collected surveillance data. This framework could be used to make short-term forecasts

498

to provide an early indication of where case numbers are higher (or lower) than

499

expected and to support the logistics of the elimination programme.

Fit and prediction metrics for selected model at each stage. The reported AIC is for the fit to training data only,

508

and RPS is of predictions made without updating this fit (i.e. fixed instead of rolling). C2575 and C1090 refer to the

509

coverage of 50% and 80% quantile intervals, respectively, alongside the average interval width in cases. Model no. 42 is the
