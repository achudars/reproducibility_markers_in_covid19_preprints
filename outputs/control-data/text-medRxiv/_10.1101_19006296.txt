Abstract

20

Objective: Many observational studies have identified that gout patients are often comorbid

21

with dyslipidemia, which is typically characterized by a decrease in high-density lipoprotein

22

cholesterol (HDL) and an increase in triglycerides (TG). However, the relationship between

23

dyslipidemia and gout is still unclear.

24

Methods: We first performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the

25

causal effect of four lipid traits on gout and serum urate based on summary association

26

statistics available from large scale genome-wide association studies (up to ~100,000 for lipid,

27

69,374 for gout and 110,347 for serum urate). We adopted multivariable Mendelian

28

randomization to estimate the causal effect independently. We also assessed the mediated

29

effect by serum urate between lipids and gout with a mediation analysis. The MR results were

30

validated with extensive sensitive analyses.

31

Results: Genetically lower HDL was positively associated with the risk of gout and serum

32

urate concentration. Each standard deviation (SD) (~12.26 mg/dL) increase was genetically

33

associated with an odds ratio of gout of 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 ~ 0.91, p = 3.31E-3) and with a

34

0.09 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.12 ~ -0.05, p = 7.00E-04) decrease in serum urate concentration.

35

Genetically higher TG was positively associated with the serum urate concentration. Each SD

36

(~112.33 mg/dL) increase was genetically associated with a 0.10 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.06 ~ 0.14,

37

p = 9.87E-05) increase in serum urate concentration. Those results were robust against

38

various sensitive analyses. In addition, the multivariable Mendelian randomization confirmed

39

the independent effect of HDL and TG on the gout/serum urate after adjustment for the other

40

lipids. Finally, the mediation analysis showed that both HDL and TG could indirectly affect

41

gout morbidity via the pathway of serum urate. The mediation effect accounted for about

42

13.0% or 28.0% of the total effect of HDL and TG, respectively.

43

Conclusion: Our study confirmed the causal associations between HDL/TG and gout/ serum

44

urate. Furthermore, the effect of HDL or TG on gout could also be mediated by serum urate.

Key Messages

49

Epidemiological studies have identified an accompanying association between lipid and

50

gout. However, whether the association is causal is unclear.

51

Mendelian randomization with genetic variants as instrumental variables is a useful tool

52

facilitate the validation of a causal relationship for modifiable risk factors.

53

The direct and indirect effects of lipids on gout, controlling for the serum urate

54

concentration, can be estimated by a mediation analysis with serum urate serving as a

55

mediator.

56

We confirmed that elevated HDL levels can directly and indirectly lead to the decreased

57

risk of gout, whereas elevation of TG levels can directly and indirectly elevate the risk of

58

gout.

Introduction

61

Gout is a common and complex form of arthritis with anyone at risk. It is characterized by

62

sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in the joints, usually resulting

63

from the chronic elevation of uric acid levels and the deposition of urate crystals in the body

64

(e.g. joints and kidneys). Gout is manifested as rheumatism, gouty arthritis or gouty

65

nephropathy, and is predominantly related to hyperuricemia due to metabolic disorders or

66

reduced excretion of uric acid. Gout is typically an acute onset of single-joint synovitis in

67

peripheral joints, causing extreme pain, whereas it is self-limiting and usually resolves within

68

a few days (1-3). The global burden of gout is substantial, with the prevalence of gout ranging

69

from 0.1% to 10% and the annual incidence from 30 to 600 cases per 100,000 individuals. In

70

addition, gout is associated with several complex diseases (e.g. metabolic syndrome (4),

71

cardiovasculopathy (5) and nephropathy (6)). Recently, gout per se was identified to be an

72

independent risk factor in cardiovascular diseases (7, 8).

73

Beyond sustained hyperuricemia (9-11), many factors as genetic, environmental and social,

74

e.g. diet, medication, comorbidities and exposure to heavy metals as cadmium and lead (12),

75

are also involved in the pathogenesis of gout(13). In addition, some empirical studies have

76

indicated a positive correlation between dyslipidemia and the risk of gout (14, 15), as

77

evidenced in the increased prevalence and incidence of gout in people with dyslipidemia (16).

78

Dyslipidemia is characteristic of aberrant blood lipids, including abnormalities of

79

high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total

80

cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). The third National Health and Nutrition Examination

81

Survey of the United States reported that in gout patients the risk of hypertriglyceridemia was

82

doubled and the odds ratio (OR) of low HDL was 1.60 after adjustment for age and gender (4),

83

implying elevated HDL may lead to the decreased risk of gout. A cross-sectional study in

84

4,053 young adults revealed that the elevation of serum urate was associated with metabolic

85

abnormalities (e.g. hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity) (17). In a study

86

of the Japanese population, glucokinase regulatory protein was associated with decreased

87

fasting blood glucose levels, elevated TG and serum urate concentrations, and was associated

88

with dyslipidemia (18). On the contrary, some studies indicated that there was no significant

89

difference in blood lipid levels between gout patients and normal controls (19).

90

These controversies over the relationship between dyslipidemia and gout may be partly

91

attributable to uncontrolled/unmeasured confounders in observational studies. Additionally,

92

doubt remains as to whether dyslipidemia is subsequent or consequent to gout. In case of

93

limited observational evidence, Mendelian randomization with genetic variants as

94

instrumental variables can facilitate the validation of a causal relationship for modifiable risk

95

factors (20-22). In brief, Mendelian randomization holds that genetic variants associated with

96

an exposure would also be associated with an outcome through the exposure route if the

97

exposure is causally associated with the outcome.

98

Mendelian randomization employs genetic variants as instruments, and is often less

99

susceptible to confounders compared with conventional observational studies in that genetic

100

variants are randomly allocated at conception (23). This randomization process is analogous

101

to the profile in a randomized controlled trial wherein participants are subjected to

102

randomized classification and varied exposure. The substantial variation of outcome between

103

groups provides evidence of the putative causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. In this

104

sense, Mendelian randomization is at the interface of experimental and observational studies

105

and is also referred to as the natural randomized trial (24, 25) to generate evidence in support

106

of the potential causal effect of an exposure.

107

Indeed, Mendelian randomization has become a potent and effective statistical method for

108

causal inference in observational studies, owing to recent achievements of genome-wide

109

association studies (GWASs) (26-34). In the present study, we employed single nucleotide

110

polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with lipid traits as instrumental variables to determine their

111

causal associations with gout. We conducted the largest and most comprehensive two-sample

112

Mendelian randomization analysis to date with summary statistics from large-scale GWASs

113

with ~180,000 individuals for lipid traits (i.e. HDL, LDL, TC and TG) (35), ~2,100 cases for

114

gout (36) and ~110,000 individuals for serum urate (36).

Materials and Methods

116

GWAS data

117

The genetic data sets of the four lipid traits (i.e. HDL, LDL, TC and TG) were available from

118

the Global Lipids Genetics consortium (GLGC) (35) (http://csg.sph.umich.edu/). After

119

stringent quality control of genetic variants and individuals, ~2,250,000 SNPs remained

120

including genotyped and imputed from 188,577 individuals of European ancestry. Each of the

121

four lipids was adjusted for available covariates (e.g. age, age2 and gender) and then the

122

resultant residuals were quantile normalized to be a standard normal distribution. The

123

association was finally performed for each SNP with a linear additive regression model. For

124

each lipid trait we yielded its summary association statistics (e.g. effect allele, effect allele

125

frequency, marginal effect size, standard error, p value and sample size).

126

We acquired genetic data sets for gout and serum urate concentration from the Global Urate

127

Genetics Consortium (http://metabolomics.helmholtz-muenchen.de/) (36). After stringent

128

quality control, a total of 69,374 (2,115 cases and 67,259 controls) European individuals and

129

2,538,056 genotyped and imputed SNPs remained for gout, and 110,347 individuals and

130

2,450,547 genotyped and imputed SNPs were reserved for serum urate. The association

131

between each SNP and gout/serum urate was analyzed with an additive logistic/linear

132

regression while adjusting for other available covariates (e.g. age and gender). Again, the

133

summary association statistics of gout/serum urate (e.g. effect allele, marginal effect size,

134

standard error, p value and sample size) were downloaded and refined. The GWAS genetic

135

data sets used in our study are summarized in Table 1.

136

Selection of instrumental variables

137

Based on our prior studies (28, 37), we selected instrumental variables for lipids with the use

138

of the clumping procedure of PLINK (version v1.90 b3.38) (38). When clumping, we set both

139

the primary significance level and the secondary significance level for index SNPs to 5.00E-8,

140

the linkage disequilibrium and the physical distance to 0.01 and 1,000 kb, respectively. We

141

then selected the lipid-specific index SNPs as instrument variables and finally generated 103

142

SNPs for HDL, 50 SNPs for LDL, 60 SNPs for TC and 60 SNPs for TG. As per previous MR

143

literature (28, 31, 39-48), we further examined pleiotropic association by removal of SNPs

144

which may be potentially associated with gout or serum urate. Specifically, we excluded index

145

SNPs which had an adjusted p value of less than 0.05 after Bonferroni correction or residing

146

within the gout- or serum-urate- associated loci (i.e. 1 Mb in the physical distance). Of note,

147

the removal of SNPs with pleiotropic effects is an authenticated manner to ensure the validity

148

of Mendelian randomization (37).

149

Estimation of causal effect and sensitivity analyses

150

We subsequently employed Mendelian randomization to determine the causal relationship

151

between lipids and gout/serum urate. First, we calculated the proportion of phenotypic

152

variance explained (PVE) by instruments and computed the F statistic for the four blood

153

lipids to quantitatively verify whether the selected index SNPs were strong instruments (28,

154

37, 49, 50). For the four lipid traits, we initially conducted the inverse variance weighted

155

(IVW) method to estimate their causal effects on gout/serum urate (51). We then conducted

156

several sensitivity analyses to assess the validity of our IVW Mendelian randomization results:

157

(1) weighted median-based method (52) and maximum likelihood method (53); (2)

158

leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation analysis (37, 49) to validate whether there were

159

instrumental outliers that can substantially impact the causal effect estimates; (3) MR-Egger

160

regression to further evaluate horizontal pleiotropic effects of instrumental variables (54); (4)

161

reverse causal analysis to assess whether gout/serum urate exhibited a causal effect on lipids

162

using instrumental variables of gout or serum urate, since the determination of the causal

163

direction is very important in Mendelian randomization (55); (5) multivariable Mendelian

164

randomization analysis (28, 37, 56) to investigate the relationship between one lipid trait (e.g.

165

HDL) and gout/serum urate while adjusting for the effects of other lipids (e.g. LDL, TC and

166

TG).

167

Mediation analysis to explore the mediation effect of serum urate in the path from lipids

168

to gout

169

Emerging evidence demonstrated that elevated serum urate is the most important single-risk

170

factor and urate-lowering therapy is frequently recommended in the clinical management of

171

gout patients (57). Nonetheless, on the grounds of the causal relationships between lipids and

172

serum urate identified in our analysis, a natural and immediate problem arose as to whether

173

serum urate can mediate the effect of lipids on gout (Fig. 1 C), or rather, do lipids have an

174

indirect effect on gout via serum urate? To address this problem, we further performed a

175

mediation analysis with serum urate serving as a mediator and estimated the mediating effect

176

of serum urate (i.e. the indirect effect of lipids) (58-62). The estimation and hypothesis testing

177

of the mediation effect were also implemented within the framework of Mendelian

178

randomization based on summary association statistics of lipids, serum urate and gout (Table

179

1 and Fig. 1 D). Briefly, we estimated the causal effect of lipids on serum urate with IVW

180

methods, and estimated the causal effect of serum urate on gout by the multivariable

181

Mendelian randomization analysis. Such an analysis is also referred to as network Mendelian

182

randomization (63, 64). The mediation effect was evaluated with the product method and was

183

tested with the Sobel test (65) or the Bootstrap test (66). The details of the mediation analysis

184

were demonstrated in Additional file 1.

185

Our statistical analysis was mainly conducted within the R (version 3.5.2) software. As there

186

were four exposures and two outcomes in our Mendelian randomization analysis, the

187

statistical significance level was adjusted to 6.30E-03 (= 0.05/8) to incorporate the issue of

188

multiple hypothesis testing. In addition, since participants had provided written informed

189

consent for data sharing as described in each of the original GWASs; ethical review was

190

omitted in our study.

Result

192

Causal effect of lipids on gout

193

We screened out 92, 48, 58 and 53 lipid-specific instrumental variables for HDL, LDL, TC

194

and TG when evaluating their associations with gout. Together, these instrumental variables

195

accounted for a total of 5.7%, 3.1%, 2.6 % and 4.3% phenotypic variances for HDL, LDL, TC

196

and TG, respectively. The F statistics for all these SNPs were greater than 10 (Additional file

197

2: Tables S1-S4), suggesting that weak instrument bias was potentially null in our analysis.

198

The Cochran's Q test (67, 68) showed that there was little evidence of instrumental

199

heterogeneity for HDL (p = 0.945), TC (p = 0.179) or TG (p = 0.379). However, an

200

instrumental heterogeneity was observed for LDL at the marginal significance level of 0.05 (p

201

= 0.047). Therefore, we employed the fixed-effects IVW method for HDL, TC and TG, and

202

applied the random-effect IVW method for LDL when estimating the causal effects on gout.

203

Among the four lipids we identified that only HDL was associated with gout (Fig. 2A-C and

204

Fig. 3). Specifically, the estimated odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) increase of

205

HDL (~12.26 mg/dL) on gout was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 ~ 0.91, p = 3.31E-3) and was

206

statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. The OR per SD increase of LDL (~30.25

207

mg/dL), TC (~36.32 mg/dL) or TG (~112.33 mg/dL) for gout was 0.81 (95% CI 0.61 ~ 1.07,

208

p = 0.079), 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 ~ 1.06, p = 0.604) and 1.16 (95% CI 0.93 ~ 1.45, p = 0.186)

209

(Fig. 3 and Additional file 3: Table S5), respectively.

210

Causal effect of lipids on serum urate

211

We generated 87, 45, 57 and 49 lipid-specific instrumental variables for HDL, LDL, TC and

212

TG when evaluating their associations with serum urate. These instrumental variables

213

explicated a total of 5.0%, 3.0%, 2.5 % and 3.7% phenotypic variances for HDL, LDL, TC

214

and TG, respectively (Additional file 2: Tables S6-S9). Thereafter, we used the random-effects

215

IVW method to estimate the causal effects due to the heterogeneity observed for all the four

216

sets of instruments (the p values of the Cochran's Q test were 5.37E-10, 6.95E-04, 3.41E-06

217

and 2.67E-03 for HDL, LDL, TC and TG, respectively). HDL is negatively associated with

218

serum urate after Bonferroni correction (estimated causal effect = -0.09, 95% CI -0.12 ~ -0.05,

219

p = 7.00E-04) (Fig. 2D-F and Fig. 3). In addition, a positive association existed between TG

220

and serum urate (estimated causal effect = 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 ~ 0.14, p = 9.87E-05) (Fig. 2G-I

221

and Fig. 3). However, no association was observed between LDL/TC and serum urate

222

(Additional file 3: Table S5 and Fig. 3).

223

Sensitivity analyses to validate the estimated causal effects

224

We subsequently performed sensitivity analyses to validate the causal association observed

225

above. Herein, we relegated the results of serum urate to Additional file 4 and focused only on

226

gout in the following paragraphs. Due to the insignificant association between LDL/TC and

227

gout/serum urate, we only summarized their results in Fig. 3 and Additional file 3: Figures.

228

S1-S3, but did not pursue any of these two sets of traits further.

229

With the maximum likelihood method, the estimated OR per SD increase of HDL on gout was

230

0.75 (95% CI: 0.62 ~ 0.91, p = 3.31E-03), in line with the IVW estimate; while the weighted

231

median method identified a consistently inverse but insignificant association (OR = 0.81, 95%

232

CI 0.59 ~ 1.11, p = 0.197). The LOO analysis showed that none of the instruments of HDL

233

could individually affect the substantial causal effect estimates (Additional file 3: Figure S4).

234

However, Fig. 2A delineated that two instrumental variables of HDL with large effect sizes on

235

gout seemed to be potential outliers (i.e. rs2566091 in gene ALDH1A2 and rs9989419 in gene

236

AC012181.1). However, they did not exert any substantial impact on the estimated causal

237

effect of HDL on gout. Specifically, after removal, the OR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60 ~ 0.91, p =

238

4.18E-03), similar to that obtained with the instruments in total (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the

239

funnel plot of HDL for gout exhibited a symmetric pattern around the causal effect point

240

estimates (Fig. 2C), offering little evidence for horizontal pleiotropy. The MR-Egger

241

regression also precluded the possibility of pleiotropy of instrument variables (the intercept =

242

-0.013, 95% CI -0.028 ~ 0.003, p = 0.113). We further performed a multivariable Mendelian

243

randomization analysis to estimate the association between HDL and gout while adjusting for

244

LDL, TC and TG. The result showed HDL a de facto inverse relationship with gout even after

245

controlling for the residual three lipid traits (Additional file 3: Table S10), implying the

246

independent causal role of HDL in the risk of gout.

247

In the reverse causal analysis, we kept one instrumental variable for gout in estimation of its

248

causal effect on HDL, and 24 (or 22) instrumental variable of serum urate when estimating its

249

effect on HDL (or TG) (Additional file 2: Tables S11-S13). With the fixed-effects IVW

250

method, the causal effect of gout on HDL was estimated to be -0.019 (95% CI: -0.018 ~

251

3.20E-03, p = 0.173), and the causal effects of serum urate on HDL and TG were estimated to

252

be -0.033 (95% CI -0.065 ~ -7.31E-04, p = 0.045) and 0.016 (95% CI: -0.016 ~ 0.048, p =

253

0.330), respectively. All of estimates were insignificant in case of multiple hypothesis testing.

254

Therefore, this analysis excluded the probability of reverse causation from gout/serum urate

255

to lipids, indicating that dyslipidemia (e.g. decreased HDL and/or increased TG) was a causal

256

factor rather than a clinical manifestation of gout or serum urate.

257

Results of the mediation analysis

258

To estimate the possible mediation of serum urate in the progression from dyslipidemia and

259

gout, we combined both the instrumental variables of lipids and serum urate, and reserved 116,

260

65, 76 and 73 lipid-specific instrumental variables for HDL, LDL, TC and TG in the

261

mediation analysis (Additional file 2: Tables S14-S18). Notably, the following reported

262

effects were corrected for the same scales (Additional file 1).

263

In the mediation analysis we observed that the summation of the mediation effect and the

264

direct effect was approximately equal to the total effect (Table 2), indicating that our

265

correction strategy used for those effects was justifiable. The total effect of HDL on gout was

266

estimated to be -0.154 (95% CI: -0.256 ~ -0.051, p = 3.31E-3; Fig. 3) and the direct effect of

267

HDL on gout was estimated to be -0.106 (95% CI: -0.189 ~ -0.022, p = 1.35E-02). More

268

importantly, the mediation effect of HDL on gout was estimated at -0.020 (95% CI: -0.033 ~

269

-0.008, p = 1.67E-03), which accounted for about 13.0% (= 0.020/0.154) of the total effect,

270

indicating that serum urate was a promising mediator between HDL and gout, and that HDL

271

could indirectly affect the risk of gout via serum urate in addition to the direct impact.

272

Likewise, the total effect of TG on gout was estimated at 0.082 (95% CI: -0.039 ~ 0.202, p =

273

1.86E-01) and the direct effect of TG on gout was estimated at 0.048 (95% CI: -0.057 ~ 0.152,

274

p = 3.71E-01). Furthermore, the mediation effect of TG on gout was estimated at 0.023 (95%

275

CI: 0.010 ~ 0.037, p = 8.39E-04), accounting for about 28.0% (= 0.023/0.082) of the total

276

effect. TG also served as a mediator between TG and gout and could indirectly increase the

277

risk of gout via serum urate. However, the mediation effects of serum urate between LDL/TC

278

and gout were insignificant (Table 2).

Discussion

280

A summary of our study

281

Many observational studies have reported that gout patients are often comorbid with

282

dyslipidemia (15, 69-72). However, the relationship between the two clinical disorders still

283

remains masked. To explore whether the association between dyslipidemia and gout is

284

causative, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis in the present study.

285

To our best knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to investigate the causal

286

relationship between lipid/serum urate and gout by employment of summary association

287

statistics obtained from large-scale GWASs with Mendelian randomization within the

288

framework of instrumental variable approaches (20).

289

With the IVW method, we observed that HDL was negatively associated with gout and TG

290

positively associated with serum urate. These inferred causal relationships were robust against

291

the designation of statistical methods. A series of sensitivity analyses (e.g., MR-Egger

292

regression) excluded the probability of instrumental pleiotropy that can contribute to bias in

293

the causal effect estimation. We also removed the reverse causality and confirmed that the

294

variations of HDL and TG levels were the premises of gout/serum urate rather than

295

consequences. Furthermore, the multivariable Mendelian randomization confirmed the

296

independent effect of HDL and TG on the gout/serum urate after adjustment for the other

297

lipids. With a mediation method, we identified a mediation effect between HDL and gout

298

mediated by serum urate, which indicated that elevated HDL could decrease the serum urate

299

and, in addition to the direct influence, indirectly relieved the risk of gout. Moreover, a

300

positive mediation effect was detected between TG and gout, i.e., though not a causal

301

contributor of gout, TG could indirectly exacerbate the risk of gout by elevating serum urate.

302

Additionally, we confirmed the positive association of serum urate with gout, which indicated

303

that elevated serum urate concentrations can causally increase the risk of gout. Overall, our

304

study affirmed that elevated HDL levels can directly and indirectly lead to the decreased risk

305

of gout, whereas elevation of TG levels can directly and indirectly elevate the risk of gout.

306

Mechanism underlying the association between dyslipidemia and gout/serum urate

307

The association between dyslipidemia and gout/serum urate is very complicated, implicated in

308

a number of mechanisms. Dyslipidemia may lead to an increase in ketone body and reduce

309

the acid-discharging ability of the kidneys, with the renal arteries and the micro-arteries of the

310

glomeruli impaired. Consequently, stenosis and occlusion of the diseased blood vessels

311

develop, with the excretion of uric acid from the kidneys is largely discounted (73).

312

Furthermore, hyperuricemia is reportedly associated with metabolic syndrome, which is

313

characteristic of hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance. An increase in TG or a decrease

314

in HDL may result in insulin resistance, consequently leading to the increased serum urate

315

during glycolysis and free fatty acid metabolism (74). Meanwhile, due to the increased

316

reabsorption of uric acid by the kidneys, serum urate directly contribute to hyperuricemia

317

(75).

318

The negative association between HDL and gout/serum urate may be attributable to the

319

anti-atherosclerotic, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects of HDL

320

(76-78). Our mediation analysis revealed that, beyond the direct effect, HDL can directly

321

abate the risk of gout by decreasing serum urate concentration. The positive correlation

322

between TG and serum urate may be exemplified by the finding that TG promotes the

323

synthesis whereas decreases the normal excretion of serum urate. Indeed, TG can indirectly

324

affect the gout via serum urate. Since excessive intake of TG-rich food (e.g. fructose and

325

fat-rich food) may cause hyperthyroidism and further increase uric acid levels (79), overmuch

326

fat metabolism-related products will inhibit the excretion of serum urate. Furthermore, the

327

synthesis of triglycerides requires NADPH, which possibly increases the concentration of

328

serum urate (80). Intriguingly, clinical studies have validated that patients with hyperuricemia

329

or gout have a 19% reduction in serum urate concentration at end of a three-week regimen of

330

oral lipid-lowering drugs, and serum urate concentration rebounded to its original level after

331

discontinuation of the agents (81), the mechanism for which awaits further investigation.

332

Limitations

333

Like other Mendelian randomization methods, our research has certain limitations. First, as

334

mentioned above, due to the small sample size of cases in gout GWAS, the statistical power

335

in our Mendelian randomized analysis was limited. For example, in our study, the sample size

336

of adult gout was 70,000 and the proportion of cases was only 3.1%; the power calculation

337

results showed that we had a small to moderate power to detect the causal association

338

between lipids and gout (Fig. 4)(82). The estimated statistical power was 28% or 15% to

339

detect an OR of 0.70/1.30 or 0.80/1.20, respectively. Second, we hypothesized that the

340

relationship between blood lipid levels and gout was linear in our analysis, but this linear

341

association might not be present in the clinical scenario, and thus we could not completely

342

eliminate the non-linear effects of lipids on gout. Third, as individual-level datasets were not

343

available; therefore, we could not evaluate the effects of extreme lipid levels on gout/serum

344

urate or conduct a stratified analysis (e.g. gender). In addition, again due to the unavailability

345

of individual-level data, we could not investigate the relationship between the TG-HDL ratio,

346

a known indicator of insulin resistance (83), and gout. Fourth, we adopted the multivariable

347

Mendelian randomization method to remove the effects of pleiotropic effects, but this method

348

was not applicable to the unknown or unmeasured pleiotropy (56).

349

Conclusion

350

In conclusion, our study confirmed the causal associations between HDL/TG and gout/serum

351

urate levels. Furthermore, serum urate can serve as a mediator for the effect of HDL or TG on

352

gout.
