Abstract
Estimating seasonal influenza prevalence is of undeniable public health importance, but
remains challenging with traditional datasets due to cost and timeliness. Digital epidemiology has the potential to address this challenge, but can introduce sampling biases that
are distinct to traditional systems. In online, participatory health surveillance systems, the
voluntary nature of the data generating process must be considered to address potential
biases in estimates. Here we examine user behaviours in one such platform, FluTracking,
from 2011 to 2017. We build a Bayesian model to estimate probabilities of an individual reporting in each week, given their past reporting behaviour, and to infer the weekly
prevalence of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in Australia. We show that a model that corrects
for user behaviour can substantially effect ILI estimates. The model examined here elucidates several factors, such as prior reporting of ILI and consistency of prior reporting, that
are strongly associated with the likelihood of participating in online health surveillance
systems. This framework could be applied to other digital participatory health systems
where participation is inconsistent and sampling bias may be of concern.

Influenza is a substantial public health concern. There are many challenges in estimating
influenza activity and forecasting the spread of influenza, given that disease transmission in
the general population is largely unobserved. Traditional influenza surveillance relies on public
health system monitoring, such as through hospital admissions, notifications of laboratory
confirmed cases, or voluntary reporting from local physicians [2, 11]. However, in these systems,
estimates of disease prevalence can be limited by the time taken to collect, collate and publish
through public health systems.
Online participatory health surveillance systems attempt to address these challenges by
providing a convenient, simple and near real-time platform for self-reporting of symptoms.
FluTracking [13] is one such system for monitoring influenza-like-illness (ILI), with a principal
aim to contribute to community level ILI surveillance in Australia and New Zealand. Similar
platforms exist in the US (Flu Near You [10]) and Europe (Influenzanet [22]).
These platforms often publish estimates of the incidence or prevalence of ILI in the population, usually derived as a proportion of the total number of reports received that week. These
estimates have been found to correlate well with clinical surveillance by public health bodies
[4, 21, 24], including across different definitions of ILI cases [22].
While systems such as FluTracking show promise in estimating the incidence of ILI in the
population, there is evidence that these systems can be effected by user participation [4, 12, 23].
Very little is known about how these biases could affect disease prevalence estimates and there
is a clear lack of studies that attempt to quantitatively adjust for them. Attempts to correct
for these biases have all been based on the removal of data, such as only considering users
who frequently participate [7, 19, 21, 22], removing the first report of a user, or by creating
noise filtering algorithms that minimise sudden departures from sentinel data due to changes
in participation [25]. While not unreasonable, these methods do not give insight into user
behaviour, and do not examine the effect of their corrections on the estimates they examine.
Some examinations of the heterogeneity of users and their behaviours have been conducted,
such as inferring significant predictors for and classifying users on their participation levels [3,
5], and examining the demographic representativeness of the participating population [5, 7,
16]. However, user behaviour has not been analysed within a systematic, statistical modelling
framework, in particular one which can simultaneously correct disease prevalence estimates.
This work addresses this gap by using information about how individuals behave with regard
to survey completion to inform our estimate of the weekly prevalence of ILI.

FluTracking Data
Participants can register in FluTracking at any stage of the year, and upon registration, they
provide various demographic details about themselves, including age, gender, and postcode.
Participants can optionally register and report on behalf of others in their household. Those
participants who are submitting reports, on behalf of themselves and/or their household, will
henceforth be referred to as ‘masters’, while any individual observed, master or not, will continue
to be referred to generally as ‘participants’. After registering, masters are sent an email on the
Monday of each week during the influenza season to respond to an online questionnaire about
the presence of fever or cough that they or their household members may have experienced in

the week prior, and whether they have received the influenza vaccine this year.
Surveys can be submitted for up to 5 weeks from their first reminder. Note that FluTracking
often publishes estimates of ILI incidence to examine the spread of new cases of ILI [8]. In
this study, we will focus on estimates of prevalence in order to determine if user behaviour is
influenced by ILI status.
If a participant reports both a fever and a cough, follow up questions are revealed, such
as enquiring about any health-seeking behaviour taken or if a sore throat was experienced. In
this study, we define an ILI case as a survey response with a fever and a cough, which closely
resembles the World Health Organization surveillance case definition [26].
Note that a report, and therefore an observation of ILI status in a household, is generated
by the action of the master, and so it is the report of the master and subsequent reports on
behalf of the rest of the household that is the outcome of interest. Also note that in order to
build a framework for near real-time prediction, we have chosen to define a report submitted
less than 7 days after the initial request as an ‘on-time’ report and not a ‘late’ report. This
is the interval of time before the subsequent request for the next survey is sent. However, if
symptoms are submitted in a late report, this information is not excluded, but used in the
derivation of predictor variables for subsequent survey weeks, irrespective of submission date.
FluTracking operates between May and October every year in the winter season in the
Southern Hemisphere. We examine all Australian reports submitted between 2011 and 2017,
totalling 3,459,339 unique reports from 30,564 households and 52,773 participants. Of these
reports, 352,287 (approx. 10%) are late reports.
Using the registration date of individuals, we can infer the weeks in which household reports
were missed and never submitted as survey weeks without a report after their registration date
for each season. This includes another 496,175 missed surveys.

The Model
We develop a framework to adjust ILI prevalence estimates by correcting for user behaviour,
and construct a model to predict the probability of a user reporting in a given week, based on
their prior behaviour and demography (Figure 1). An individual household i in a given week w
will receive a survey request to participate, and will then proceed to either report and provide
information on their symptoms, or not report. Given that they report, and their symptoms are
therefore known, they will either report on-time, or report late. We will compare the following
two estimates of the prevalence of ILI:
• the naı̈ve estimate (an extension of the conventional estimate); and,
• a behaviour corrected estimate, (our new framework).
The conventional estimate in the literature is given by the total number of individuals that
have reported with ILI, divided by the number of on-time reports in the given week. Our naı̈ve
estimate extends this by considering a Bayesian estimate, which respects the same mode value
as the conventional estimate (see Materials and Methods). The behaviour corrected estimate
is inferred from a framework that incorporates an observation process in the model, whereas

Materials and Methods
Naı̈ve Model
The conventional estimate takes the total number of individuals that have reported with ILI this
week Xw and divides this by the number of on-time reports this week Nw . If we consider that
each individual in the population has an equal probability π̂w of having ILI in week w, then Xw
can be modelled with a binomial likelihood with probability π̂w and trials Nw . Note that this
interpretation does not consider any uncertainty in Nw . Given a uniform prior Beta(1, 1) and
a binomial likelihood, the posterior distribution of π̂w is then Beta(Xw + 1, Nw − Xw + 1). This
results in the mode of the posterior distribution of π̂w as Xw /Nw , which is the conventional point

estimate often used in the literature (See [18, 21, 22, 25]). We define this posterior distribution
of π̂w as the naı̈ve estimate, which is an estimate for the prevalence of ILI in the population,
without consideration of user behaviours. In this work, we will split the cohort by vaccination
status, and compare naı̈ve estimates for the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations to the
behaviour corrected estimates from the model proposed below.

Behaviour Model
We construct a model (Figure 1) that accounts for user behaviour and informs an estimate
for the prevalence of ILI in the population, for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. For
a household i in week w, let Yi,w be a binary indicator of an on-time report submitted by the
master of the household and Πw the probability of an individual having ILI in a given week w.
Then Yi,w can be modelled as a Bernoulli random variable,
Yi,w ∼ Ber (pi,w ) ,

(1)

where pi,w is the reporting probability.
Logistic regression can then be used to estimate a household’s probability of reporting pi,w ,
where for some set of predictors xi,w and parameter vector γ. The link function is defined as

Let Ii,w be a binary indicator of at least one participant of the household having ILI. Then,
given that a household i has reported in week w, the household may have at least one participant
reporting ILI symptoms, or the household has no participants reporting ILI.
Assume each household member has an independent probability Πw (V ) of having ILI in
week w given V , where V is a binary indicator for their vaccination status. Then let

and the probability a household has no participants with ILI (Ii,w = 0) is 1 − φi,w .
Given that a household i reports in week w and has ILI status Ii,w , we can then model the

where ωi,w is a vector of predictors and θI is a vector of parameters dependent on I .
So for every household in every week, there can be one of five outcomes zi,w :
• zi,w = 1: A household submits a report on-time, and no participants report having ILI
(Yi,w = 1, Ii,w = 0, Li,w = 1),
• zi,w = 2: A household submits a report late, and no participants report having ILI
(Yi,w = 1, Ii,w = 0, Li,w = 0),
• zi,w = 3: A household submits a report on-time, and at least one participant reports
having ILI (Yi,w = 1, Ii,w = 1, Li,w = 1),
• zi,w = 4: A household submits a report late, and at least one participant reports having
ILI (Yi,w = 1, Ii,w = 1, Li,w = 0), or
• zi,w = 5: A household does not submit a report (Yi,w = 0).
Therefore, we can describe the outcome zi,w as following a categorical distribution:
zi,w ∼ Categorical(p),

P(γ, θI , π, λ|X, y) ∝ P (y|γ, θI , π, λ, X) P (γ, θI , π, λ) .

(7)

Prior distributions for the parameters were:
γ ∼ Norm(0, 0.7I),
θI ∼ Norm(0, 0.7I),
π, λ ∼ Unif(0, 1),

where 0 is the zero vector and I is the identity matrix.
The variance of the prior distributions for γ and θI were chosen to provide a near uniform
prior density for the probability of reporting and reporting on-time, given the distribution
of the training set predictors. Figure S1 in the Supplementary Information shows the prior
distribution transformed from the log odds scale to the probability scale, after multiplication
with samples from the training set predictors. Results were not sensitive to this choice of
variance.
All predictors ωi,w and xi,w were scaled to be between 0 and 1, to allow for simplicity in
comparing the predictive strength of each parameter. The set of predictors used for regression
were derived from variables listed in Table 1, and the complete set of predictors used can be
seen in Table S1.
To estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the model, we used Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (HMC) implemented in the software package Stan (version 2.18) [9]. HMC is
particularly effective over other Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as Random Walk
Metropolis-Hastings, in high dimensional parameter spaces such as in this analysis, and the
Stan implementation uses adaptive tuning of algorithm parameters, reducing the need to tune
the inference algorithm [6].
For model training and inference of results, 80% of the households in each year were used in
the training set for the model, and the remainder left in a test set for cross-validation of model
predictions. For each season examined, the first week of reports was used in determining the
prior behaviours of users and used in calculating predictor values, but were not used to infer
parameters of the model, as predictors involving prior behaviours could not be well defined in
the first week.

have nearly all their probability density higher than the distribution of the behaviour corrected
estimates for the ILI prevalence in vaccinated individuals λw and for unvaccinated individuals
πw (Figure 2). The effect is greatest for unvaccinated individuals. This bias was found to be
greatest when prevalence of ILI was greatest, and implies that users may be more likely to report
when they have ILI. This trend was observed for every year of analysis (see Supplementary
Information). Figure 2 shows the results from training the model on the year 2017. While it
can be tempting to use the difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated estimates as a
measure of influenza vaccine effectiveness, in this study we examine cases of ILI, not influenza.
Any examination of vaccine effectiveness will require further modelling.

Reporting Behaviour
Predictors of reporting behaviour were determined from chronological, epidemiological and
demographic data (Table 1). Given a consistent identification number for each individual and
each household, predictors such as the week of the survey, whether the individual reported
having a single symptom previously this year, and whether an individual is reporting on behalf
of others can be determined. A full list of predictors used and their explanations can be found
in Table S1.
Unsurprisingly, the greatest predictor for reporting behaviour was found to be the proportion
of reports submitted on-time in the year so far for an individual, with all posterior samples of
log odds ratio greater than 4 (see Figure S10). Here we will present predictors of interest, and

the marginal densities of all predictors are presented in the Supplementary Information.
A comparison of marginal posterior densities of regression coefficients for predicting the
probability of reporting (pi,w ) can be seen in Figure 3. Those reporting on behalf of others
were not found to be much more likely to report, inconsistent with analysis in other studies
[3, 5]. These studies did not consider the past reporting behaviour of users in their analysis,
and this may have confounded this predictor in previous work. Individuals who have reported
being vaccinated for this season were also found to be more likely to report in any given week.
Individuals who had reported having ILI in previous weeks were much more likely to submit
a report. However, the increasing number of weeks since the ILI occurred was a strong predictor
for not submitting a report. Given no other differences, the model then predicts an increase in
probability for an individual to report when they have reported having ILI, with the increase
decaying over time as the number of weeks since reporting ILI increases. This relationship
was also seen in later years (2015 to 2017), when there is a report of a participant, excluding
the master, reporting having ILI. However, this effect was small. The posterior densities are
remarkably consistent across the years, with the direction of the effect of the predictor consistent
in all years, with the exception of those with small effects.
The current week was also used as a predictor for the probability a user will report, and
their marginal probabilities of reporting declined sharply in the first third of the season, before
a more shallow decline as the season continues (Figure 4). This could be explained by user
fatigue, where dedication to participating in a voluntary system wanes through the year. This
trend was also seen in every year studied (see Supplementary Information).

Reporting On-time
A comparison of densities of the log odds ratio of the regression coefficients for predicting the
I
probability of an on-time report given a report was submitted (αi,w
) is presented in Figure 5.
During school holidays, individuals were less likely to report on-time, with the effect stronger
for those who did not have ILI at the time. This may be due to disrupted schedules during
the school holidays where emails may not be checked (and thus the reminder missed), before
observing the emails once returning to work. The effect may be stronger for those who have ILI
as they are reminded to report due to their symptoms. Reporting on behalf of others was a small
predictor of reporting on-time in the earlier years (2011 to 2013), especially those reporting ILI.
In later years (2014 to 2017), the effect was mixed based on ILI status. Households reporting
with ILI were more likely to report on-time, while those who did not have ILI were more likely
to report late.
Those who had reported having ILI previously in the year did not appear to be more or
less likely to report on-time, despite being more likely to report in general, as discussed earlier.
Individuals who identified as having an occupation that works with patients were slightly less
likely to report on-time.

Model Validation
To validate the model, 20% of the households in each year were excluded from training the
model and kept as a test set. Model predictions were compared to observations in the test
set by taking 1000 samples of the parameters from the posterior distribution, and simulating
outcomes from the model for each sample and each household in the test set. The simulated
data classified each household in each week into one of the five outcomes (Figure 1).
The proportion of reporting households with at least one participant with ILI, and the
participation rate of households of the simulated data, were compared to observations from
the test set. The proportion of reporting households with at least one participant with ILI
was calculated by dividing the number of households reporting on-time with ILI by the total
number of households reporting on-time. The participation rate of households is determined by
dividing the number of households reporting by the total number of households registered who
have submitted at least one report in that year. Both summary statistics from the data were
similar to simulations from the model on the test set, and these comparisons can be seen in the
Supplementary Information Figures S20 to S26. The simulated data from the model matches
well to the actual observations from the test set and appears to retain the autocorrelation or
time dependence of the actual test outcomes, without time dependence being explicitly included
in the model. As the model predictions correspond well to outcomes observed in the test set
in both summary statistics, the model shows no indication of bias of observable outcomes at a

population level.

Discussion
Online participatory health surveillance systems strive to provide near real-time estimates of
disease prevalence, and yield complementary insights to traditional public health systems. However, the voluntary nature of these systems, and the reliance on user participation, need to be
considered.
In this work we find that history of ILI in the year, as well as other demographic factors,
impacts the probability a user will submit a report. At a population level in FluTracking,
this results in overestimation of the prevalence of ILI in the population when using the naı̈ve
estimate. This difference is greatest near the peak prevalence of ILI. This may be due to users
being triggered to report by their symptoms, and being more likely to report in voluntary health
surveillance systems when directly affected by the illness.
Participation in FluTracking, derived as the number of on-time reports divided by the
number of registered users reporting at least one in a given year, generally ranges between 70%
and 90% for any given year and any given week. This is much higher than rates observed in
Influenzanet and Flu Near You, where previous studies have shown that 70% and 35% of users
respectively submit more than 3 reports in a season [3, 5]. This is despite FluTracking having
proportionally much higher numbers of participants than the European and US systems, relative
to the respective populations of these regions. While the variance of participation over time
has not been examined in the other systems, correcting for user behaviour would potentially
be even more critical than observed here.
The prevalence of ILI was higher for those who were unvaccinated compared to those who
were vaccinated in the peak weeks of prevalence. However, this should not be seen as a measure
of influenza vaccine effectiveness. The vaccine is not targeted to ILI, and the difference in
prevalence over time does not consider the population size, or the number of cases of influenza
reduced in a season.
However, there exists the potential to construct a measure of vaccine effectiveness by comparing the two groups. The conventional metric of test-negative cases [17] does not extend
simply to the behaviour corrected estimates presented here. However, with the potential to
correct for potential bias in the data and reporting behaviour across different years, further
studies may help inform vaccine effectiveness estimates in near real time.
Whilst past behaviours and illness status were used to predict user participation within the
season, this study did not attempt to train the model across seasons. Training the model across
every season would allow for users’ behaviour in past years to inform behaviour in later seasons.
However, the computational difficulty in substantially increasing the size of the training data,
and the number of parameters involved, remains a challenge left for further work.
Predictors for user behaviour have only been taken from within the FluTracking data set.
Social media and news coverage [20] and public awareness [14] are some examples where external
factors can influence behaviour during an epidemic. Inclusion of these factors in the model may
further improve estimates of disease prevalence where user behaviour may be significant.

This analysis assumes each individual has an equal probability of having ILI in a given week.
Incorporating a spatial mechanistic model, particularly given the postcode and demographic
information in the data set may enable further insights into the mechanisms that drive the
transmission of influenza and ILI in Australia. Recent analysis has shown the onset of influenza
epidemics is largely synchronised across regional areas [15].
With this model we have shown that user behaviour can have a significant effect on disease
prevalence estimates drawn from the data. The framework developed herein, which elucidates
drivers of user reporting in voluntary health surveillance systems and improves estimates of
disease prevalence, should prove useful as digital data streams burgeon in epidemiology.

Methods
Table S.1 presents all predictors used in the analysis. Figure S.1 depicts the choice of prior
distribution for the regression coefficients.

Results
All figures are presented in reverse chronological order, as the more recent years have the most
directly comparable populations of participants to 2017, the year that was primarily discussed in
the main paper. Figures S.2 to S.7 compare the naı̈ve estimate to model posterior distributions
of ILI prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals across all years studied. 2017
results are presented in the main article. Figures S.8 to S.11 show the marginal posterior
densities of the log odds ratio of all regression coefficients for predicting the probability of
an individual reporting across all years examined. Figures S.12 to S.14 show the marginal
posterior densities of the log odds ratio of all regression coefficients for predicting the probability
of an individual reporting on-time given they have reported and their ILI status, across all years
examined. Figures S.15 to S.21 compare the model predictions against summary statistics of
the test sets across all years examined.

Figure S.12: The marginal posterior densities of the log odds ratio of the first half of regression
coefficients for predicting the probability of an individual reporting on-time given they have
reported and their ILI status, across all years examined. The upper density is the density of
the regression coefficient given that the household has no participant with ILI, and the lower
density is the density given the household has at least one participant with ILI.
