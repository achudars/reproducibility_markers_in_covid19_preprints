Abstract
In addition to biological sex, gender, the sociocultural dimension of being a woman or a man, plays a
central role in health. However, there are so far no approaches to quantify gender in a retrospective
manner in existing study datasets. We therefore aimed to develop a methodology that can be
retrospectively applied to assess gender in existing cohorts. We used baseline data from the Berlin
Aging Study II (BASE-II), obtained in 2009-2014 from 1869 participants aged 60 years and older. We
identified 13 gender related variables and used them to construct a gender score (GS) by primary
component and logistic regression analysis. Of these, 9 variables contributed to a gender score:
chronic stress, marital status, risk taking behavior, agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion,
loneliness, conscientiousness, and education. GS differed significantly between females and males as
defined by sex. Next, we calculated linear regressions to investigate associations between sex, GS,
and selected biological and well-being variables. Sex, but not GS was significantly associated with
LDL-C and TC. GS, but not sex, was significantly associated with cortisol levels, CES-depression,
negative affect, life satisfaction. Thus, we were able to develop a GS in a retrospective manner from
available study variables that characterized women and men in addition to biological sex. This
approach will allow us to introduce the notion of gender retrospectively into a large number of
studies.

Introduction
Biological sex and gender, the sociocultural dimension of being a woman or a man, play a central role
in health.1-4 Unlike sex, which is biologically based, gender incorporates the sociocultural dimension of
being a woman or a man in a given society.1, 2 It determines interaction of patients with doctors and
the health care system, help-seeking behavior and access to care. Since biological sex and gender
overlap, but are not identical, gender is likely to influence health differently from biological sex.1, 2
Whereas sex is relatively easy to quantify, few possibilities exist to quantify gender in a reproducible
manner.
Recently, the Canadian members of our group and their partners constructed a gender score (GS) in a
prospective manner. This GS included a variety of carefully selected psychosocial and sociocultural
variables, in order to characterize and distinguish women and men from one another over and above
biological sex in cohort studies.1, 2 In a prospective study in patients with ACS, the GS was more strongly
associated with several important cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and one-year mortality than
biological sex. 1, 2
It was concluded that the GS can be used to evaluate the effect of gender independent from the effects
of sex on disease presentation, processes of care, and relevant outcomes. Including such a gender
dimension into clinical studies may thus add new explanatory value to understand clinical outcomes.
Therefore, it would be desirable to calculate a GS in as many study databases as possible.
Since the majority of existing studies did not include a GS in a prospective manner, we aimed in the
present study to develop a methodology that could be retrospectively applied so as to assess gender
in existing study cohorts. This should be possible since most study databases include a large number
of psychosocial and/or socioeconomic variables that are potentially gender-related and could be used
to construct a GS. We therefore decided to use, in a paradigmatic approach, the Berlin Aging Study II
(BASE-II) to develop a strategy to construct a GS in a retrospective manner. We used the data, obtained
in BASE-II from 2009-2014, and selected potentially gender-related variables from the initial
investigation that covered the different dimensions of gender and that were as close as possible to
those included in the prospectively developed score from GENESIS-PRAXY. We then tested the
distribution of this score between women and men and analyzed its independent associations with
clinical disease indicators and biological risk factors.

Methods
We used baseline data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), obtained in 2009-2014 from 1869
participants aged 60 years and older.5 Because of the larger BASE-II sample of n=2200 participants

was tested in different years from different research units, not all data were available in all cases and
we focused on those data available in more than 65 % of cases.
First we selected potentially gender related variables from the study database that reflect different
aspects of the gender construct (e.g. gender roles, gender typical behavior) in which women and men
traditionally differ.6, 7 These variables were selected to replicate as close as possible the items used in
the GENESIS-PRAXY study, related to social roles and social support related variables (employment
status, family status, level of Education) as well as gender related personality traits: chronic stress
(assessed using the Trier Chronic Stress Inventory, TICS); perceived stress (assessed using the
Perceived Stress Scale, PSS)8 loneliness (assessed using the UCLA Loneliness Scale)9; Big five
personality traits (using the BIG Five Inventory with its dimensions “openness to experience”,
“conscientiousness”, “extraversion”, “agreeableness” and “neuroticism”)10; risk-taking behavior11. All
were measured using validated self-report questionnaires.
When possible, we calculated scores according to questionnaire standard. For the BFI, TICS, and
UCLA-Loneliness, mean scores across items were used (for details, see Gerstorf et al., 2015; Kühn,
Düzel, Drewelies, Gerstorf, Lindenberger, & Gallinat, 2018).12, 13
All participants gave written informed consent. The Ethics Commission of the Berlin Chamber of
Physicians (Ärztekammer Berlin) approved the BASE study prior to the first assessments in 1990 (the
approval was not numbered), and the Ethics Committee of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin
approved the BASE-II study (approval number EA2/029/09)14.
Overall strategy and statistical approach:
Our approach was divided in 3 steps (figure 1): GS development, GS calculation in individual cases
and GS application.
GS Development
For step 1 all 1869 cases were used. First, a bivariate correlation analysis was performed and for each
significantly correlated pair of variables with a correlation coefficient equal or greater than 0.80, one
of the two variables was randomly removed. Next, PCA analysis was conducted with a varimax
rotation method to validate the component matrix results. In interpreting the factor analysis, an item
was said to load on a given component if the factor loading was 0.40 or greater for that component
and was less for other components.
Based on the remaining variables, Logistic regression (LR) models for the association with sex were
calculated one by one and all non-significant variables were removed in a descending order based on
the size of their non-significant p-value.

GS calculation in individual cases
For step 2, the coefficient estimates of these variables associated with sex were used for GS
calculation case by case. For this step, the presence of all variables was required in each study
subject. This reduced the number of cases available for calculation of individual GS to 1089 (Fig 1).
GS Application
In a 3rd step, the association of GS with clinical and psychosocial variables was tested using
parametric and non-parametric tests as well as linear regression analyses. This step required the
presence of GS and the clinical/ psychosocial investigation in all cases. This reduced the number of
cases to 1045.
Statistical tests
SPSS version 25 was used to perform statistical analysis. For the comparison of means Chisq. Test or
T-test and Mann-Whitney U test was used where appropriate. Bivariate correlations were calculated
with 0.80 as the cut off values. Logistic models were used to model the probability of associated
variables. To look for an index of sensitivity and specificity the Curve statistic was performed for GS
(0-100) as the test variable and sex (0 = men, 1 = women). Significance level was determined for p <
0.05 for the group differences and LR models.

Results
Development of the gender score (GS)
To calculate the GS in the BASE II cohort, we considered a total of 13 variables (table 1). In the first
step, we estimated a correlation matrix to test for the existence of highly correlated variables. Since
none of the correlations exceeded r = 0.58 (Table S1), we retained all 13 variables for the next step of
PCA, assessment of factor loading. The 13 variables loaded onto five components (Table 2, PCA,
factor loadings).
In the next step, the 13 variables were used to perform a LR analysis with sex as a dependent
variable. Non-significant variables were removed one by one in a descending order of their p-value
(0.05). In total, 5 models were explored, the final model is presented in Table 3. The nine statistically
significant variables were retained. They were: chronic stress (TICS mean), marital status, risk taking
behavior, BFI agreeableness, BFI neuroticism, BFI extraversion, loneliness (UCLA-Loneliness mean),
BFI Conscientiousness, and education.

Calculation of gender score (GS) in individual cases
The coefficients of the final logistic regression analysis were used to calculate the gender score (GS),
with a range from 0 to 100. Our whole cohort of participants evenly spread over the score. The GS in
the 1st, 2nd, 3rdtertile ranged from 2-37, 38-68, 69-98 %, for women and men (table S 2). However, the

frequency distribution of women and men differed. 55 % of men were located in the first tertile with
more masculine GS and 51 % of women in the 3rdtertile with the more feminine scores. At the same
time, the distributions showed considerable overlap with a 36% and 31% of women and men in the
middle tertile and 13 % of women and 14 % of men having score values of the opposite gender (Fig 2,
table S2).
To look how well GS separated women and men, a ROC analysis with 1089 participants was
performed that had a gender score available. The Area Under the Curve statistic was .795, p < .001,
95% CI [.769, .821] which indicates fair-to-good sensitivity/specificity (test values ranged between 0.5
and 1).

Association of the GS with clinical and psychosocial variables
Next, we tested the association of the GS with clinical parameters and measures of well-being,
including lipid levels, total cholesterol (TC), HbA1c, CES-Depression, cortisol levels, grip strength,
negative affect, and life satisfaction. Table 4 and Table 5 show the distribution of these variables
according to biological sex and GS tertiles. Most of the variables with significant differences between
women and men (Table 4a) were also significantly different across GS tertiles (Table 4b). Body mass
index and family history of cardiovascular disease were exceptions, with significant differences when
analyzed by sex, but not by gender.
In a next step, we performed linear regressions to further investigate associations between sex, the
GS, and biological and well-being variables. Different linear models were performed to determine the
impact of sex and gender separately (Table 5 a ) and in combination (Table 5 b). These models
revealed that sex was significantly associated with LDL-C and TC, with the GS not additionally
showing any association in the models. In contrast, the GS was significantly associated with cortisol
levels, CES-depression, negative affect and life satisfaction, with sex not associated with these
parameters. Interestingly, hand grip strength was associated with both sex and GS. The associations
with hand grip strength, cortisol and life satisfaction were negative suggesting that a more feminine
score is associated with lower levels of these parameters, whereas all other parameters were
positively associated. That is, independent of sex, a GS associated with more traditionally feminine
characteristics was associated with exhibiting lower hand grip strength and cortisol as well as
reporting lower levels of life satisfaction. At the same time, independent of sex, a GS associated with
more traditionally feminine characteristics was also associated with reporting more depressive
symptoms and higher levels of negative affect. HbA1c was not associated with either sex or GS (Table
5b).

Discussion
Our study is the first to construct a GS in a retrospective manner from available study variables. The
developed GS was differently distributed in women and men. Biological sex and GS had different
predictive power for a number of biological and sociocultural variables, with sex being a better
predictor for biological phenotypes and gender being a better predictor for sociocultural ones; for
the most part independently of the biological sex of the participants.
We used the BASE-II cohort that provided data on older predominantly healthy adults in and around
Berlin, Germany5, to construct a GS in analogy to the score that was developed in a mainly Canadian
cohort of younger patients with acute coronary syndrome. The novelty of our approach was the fact
that we were developing the GS in a completely retrospective manner. BASE-II was primarily not
designed to analyze the impact of sex and gender on study data. So, in the primary data assessment in
BASE-II, we identified 13 psychosocial and socioeconomic variables that we believed to be associated
with the four dimensions of gender7. We used these to construct a GS, ranging from 0 (purely
masculine) to 100 (purely feminine). The GS of the individual cases in the whole group were almost
evenly distributed over the total range from 0 to 100 which was different from the distribution of GS
in the only other cohort published so far1, where the whole first tertile of patients was clustering in the
left corner (GS from 0-10). However, we obtained a similar but not identical frequency distribution of
women and men as the previous study, with 55 % of men in the first tertile with more masculine GS
and 51 % of women in the 3rd tertile with the more feminine scores1. In our cohort, the distributions
showed a considerably stronger and more symmetrical overlap with almost a third of women and men
in the middle tertile and 13 % of women and 14 % of men having score values of the opposite gender.
Thus, the GS gives information clearly different from biological sex, but its distribution is different in
the Canadian young diseased and the German healthy aged cohorts.
When constructing the GS, fewer socioeconomic variables than desired were available as may be the
case in many clinical and medically focused epidemiological studies. The limited availability of
variables may explain differences in the variables that constitute the GS in women and men between
our study and previously published data1. Furthermore, in the aged cohort of BASE-II, with mainly
retired persons, other variables may be gender relevant than in younger cohorts with CVD disease.
Psychological parameters, such as perceived stress, loneliness, agreeableness, neuroticism,
contributed significantly to the psychosocial differences among women and men.
Furthermore, family status and education, reflecting institutionalized gender, also had a high impact
in GS calculation. Family status probably scored high since a large percentage of women in this
generation were living as widows or as singles. The influence of education is also well
understandable: The traditional role of a daughter in Germany in the 1950’s or earlier, when many of

our study participants were born, was to marry, not to go to the university or achieve any higher
education.
To assess the impact of GS, we tested the associations of GS with biological variables and with two
well-being indicators. Sex was more strongly associated with the more biological variables, i.e. lipid
levels and grip strength. Interestingly enough, lipid levels were higher in women, in individuals with
female sex and female gender characteristics. This may have been due to chronic undertreatment of
high lipid levels in women as reported previously15, 16. HbA1c levels were not associated with sex or
gender and we assume that the effect of individual treatment may have contributed to this
phenomenon.
Gender, in particularly female gender, was more strongly associated with the life style factors,
depression, mood-related hormone cortisol, negative effects, and low life satisfaction, than sex. This
is in agreement with previously published results17.

Limitations of the study
Our approach has strengths and weaknesses. Limitations result from the retrospective nature of our
analysis and the limited number of gender-related variables available in our study. This is, however,
an inherent component of our approach: we wanted to develop a method that enables researchers
to measure gender in a retrospective manner since we feel that many studies exist in which an
estimate of gender, even if retrospective, could uncover new aspects and reveal important insights.
Second, we chose to use reported sex as a dependent variable in our logistic regression analysis
because there is no gold standard for the gender, reported sex is likely the closest measure of gender
available in most surveys. BEM sex role inventory could have been used as a dependent variable
instead of the sex. However, this scale only includes personality traits that are only encompass the
gender identity aspect of the gender construct and was not present in our retrospective dataset.

Conclusions and future aspects
With our strategy, we were able to develop a gender score (GS) in a retrospective manner from
available study variables that characterized women and men in addition to biological sex. This means
that the notion of gender can be retrospectively introduced into a large number of studies. In future
approaches, we will test how sex and the gender score respectively predict clinical outcomes in this
predominantly healthy cohort. If we find that the gender score acts as an outcome predictor beyond
clinical parameters, new preventive options may arise.

Dependent variable

We used linear regression models to determine the association of sex and gender with biological and
psychosocial variables. For each of the biological and psychosocial (dependent) variables a linear
model was calculated, all including sex or the GS as the only independent variable. The R2was used
to assess how much of the variability was explained by sex or the GS. The number of available data is
indicated in Table 4 for each of the dependent variables explored. Information on gender score were
available for all 543 men and 502 women. β*, unstandardized regression coefficient beta.

Dependent variable

We used linear regression models to determine the association of sex and the GS with biological and
psychosocial variables. For each of the biological and psychosocial (dependent) variables a linear
model was calculated, all including sex and the GS as independent variables. All models explained
less than 10% (R2) of the variability, with the exception of the model for hand grip strength, in which
65% of the variability in grip strength was explained by sex and the GS. β*, unstandardized regression
coefficient beta.
