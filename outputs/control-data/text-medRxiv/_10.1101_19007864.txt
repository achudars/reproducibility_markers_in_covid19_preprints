Abstract
Background: A lower allergy and asthma prevalence in farm
children has been described three decades ago in Switzerland.
Objective: After years of research into bacterial exposure at farms,
the origin of the farm effect is still unknown. We now hypothesize,
that there is no such an effect in large industrial cattle farms with
slatted floors indoors but in small farms only where animals are
grazing outdoors and are having a higher endoparasite load.
Methods: We re-analyze an earlier epidemiological study by
record-linkage to later agricultural surveys. The Asthma and
Allergy Study in 1989/90 was a cross-sectional study of 1714 ten
year old children in 63 villages covering ten different districts of
Upper Bavaria. The farm effect is defined here as the association of
number of cows per villager on lifetime prevalence of allergic
rhinitis prevalence in the children of this village.
Results: The farm effect is restricted to small villages only.
Furthermore, districts with higher Fasciola infection rates of cows,
show a significant stronger farm effect than districts with lower
infection rates.
Conclusions: The results warrant further research into human
immune response to endoparasites in livestock.

Introduction
The lower allergy prevalence in the farming population has been
described already in one of the very first allergy text books in
1873 (1): „These statistics of the occupations of hay-fever patients bring
out prominently the very curious circumstance that the persons who are
most subjected to the action of pollen belong to a class which furnished
the fewest cases of the disorder, namely, the farming class“. A direct
allergy preventive effect by farming conditions remained unlikely
as occupational asthma is frequently increased in farmers due to
exposure to grain dust, animal dander and various chemicals (2).
In 1989, however, the „farm effect“ was re-discovered by Gassner
in the Canton of St. Gallen in the Swiss Alps (3), followed by
studies of Braun-Fahrländer (4) and several other groups (5). We
already noticed the effect 1989 in the Asthma and Allergy Study in
Upper Bavaria, Germany (6) but attributed it to rather trivial
reasons.
A healthy worker effect is likely in farmers, as allergy to grass or
dust would leave to a drop-out of farming. Not unexpected farm
children have a much lower family history of „hay fever“ (4)
possibly related to genetic differences in the farming population
(7). Farm children may have experienced some kind of autodesensitization due to the extreme allergen exposure (8).

Furthermore, farmer’s children are known to supplement less
vitamin D which means avoiding a known risk factor (9).
None of these objections have not been thoroughly addressed so
far. While the „farm effect“ has had little value in explaining the
temporal rise of allergy, it may represent, however, an interesting
observation where indeed an environmental substance may modify
the allergic reaction. It has been reported several times that dust
collected from cow stables has suppressive effects on the allergic
sensitization in laboratory animals (10), (11). Although this could
be an artifact as well either by the high allergen doses used or by
the different immune reaction of mice, it raises the possibility that
there is an indeed a protective factor of stable dust.
As IgE production in the human host is usually related to helminth
exposure and not so much of bacterial load as being used as
explanation (11 - 13), we now ask if cattle endoparasites could be
responsible for an allergy modifying effect.

Participants, materials and methods
Data of the Asthma and Allergy Study in Upper Bavaria 1989/1990
are used for an ecological re-analysis. Methods have been
reported elsewhere including informed consent and ethics
procedures (14 - 15). Briefly, we approached primary grade

schools of 65 villages where 63 schools could visited in a semirandom order. 1714 of 1958 children participated in the study
(87.5%). Parents filled in a self-administered questionnaire,
children were tested by several allergens on the skin along with
baseline lung function and lung function after inhalation of cold
air. For the current analysis we did not any exclude any children.
Geocodes data for school districts have been obtained from
geoportal.bayern.de/bayernatlas. Number of village inhabitants
and assignment to districts was obtained of de.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Oberbayern. The number of farm animals per village was imported
from the official survey 1999 („Agrarstrukturerhebung“,
www.statistikdaten.bayern.de/genesis, tables 41121-xxxx ) where
all farms with an area >2 ha or >8 cows are being recorded. Cow
Fasciola infection ratio by districts was taken of a German thesis
who tested between 2003 and 2005 milk samples from 80 farms
in Bavaria for being positive in an anti-f2 Fasciola hepatica IgG
assay. Altogether 5278 tank milk samples were examined and
mean values calculated per district (16). Although most data here
were acquired 10-15 years after the initial survey, farm size
usually does not change and also conditions of wet farm ground
with continuous re-infection remain unchanged. Life expectancy of
cattle is around 20 years.

Data were visualized using the R libraries ggplot2, cross-tabulated
and analyzed by logistic regression (17, 18).

Results
Mean age of the children was 10 years with an age range of 9-13
years. There were 836 males, 870 females, while in 8 children sex
was not known. Lifetime prevalence of physician diagnosed allergic
rhinitis was 8.3% and of asthma 2.6%.
Supplemental Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of the
villages. As school sizes ranged from 6 to 63 children, mean
rhinitis prevalence by village may be misleading in particular when
villages are small.
Village size ranged from 858 to 8,578 residents, with a mean of
3,445 residents. Cow numbers ranged from 147 to 7,078 with a
mean of 2,707 animals. The cows/resident ratio in the villages was
found between 0 to 2.4 mit a mean of 0.9.
Allergic rhinitis prevalence decreased with increasing number of
cows per village inhabitants, however, this effect was restricted to
small villages (Supplement Figure 2) leading to the known
30%-40% reduction of allergic rhinitis.

Fasciola infection rate was found to be highly variable in the 10
districts with a prevalence between 18% and 98%. The prevalence
of allergic rhinitis decreased with increasing Fasciola infection,
however, only in those villages that have >1.5 cows/resident
(Supplement Figure 3).
In a last step we analyze the data using separate logistic
regression equations for each district (table). Fasciola infection
was not significant on the p<0.05 level in any district while in the
total sample the cows/resident ratio was a significantly protective
factor (p=0.004, Figure).

Discussion
In this ecological analysis we replicate the known negative
association of cattle farming and allergic rhinitis and find some
preliminary evidence that cow endoparasites may be involved in
this association. As there were no effects by other farm animals
like pigs, goats, horses and chicken (data not shown) it may
indeed be a cow derived factor that could explain the farm effect.
Ecological studies are studies of risk-modifying factors on health
defined either geographically or temporally. As risk-modifying
factors and outcomes are averaged for the populations in each
geographical unit and then compared using standard statistical

methods, this study is useful for quickly generating a hypotheses
as it could use already existing data. As an ecological analysis it
may fail, however, for reasons already delineated in the
introduction, and will need further clinical and experimental
support.
At least it seems straightforward to relate IgE biology to helminthic
exposure rather than to bacterial load while Fasciola may be just
an indicator of mixed infections usually found in cattle. Infected
cattle rarely demonstrate clinical disease, while it is known that
Fasciola has numerous immunosuppressive functions in the host.
IgE is not always raised (19) probably as Fasciola can degrade
human immunoglobulins (20) and even induce eosinophil
apoptosis (21).
So far, the possibility of any helminth effect has been excluded
(22) due to the fact, that farm children do not show raised
eosinophils or high IgE levels. If, however, already contact to eggs
or other secreted protein is being sufficient as observed for
example with Schistosoma eggs (23), this argument may not be
conclusive.
This may be also the case with another recent study (24) that
found remarkable differences in the asthma prevalence between
Amish and Hutterite populations. The lifestyle of both
communities is similar but their farming practice is distinct as the

Amish follow a more traditional style of outdoor grazing whereas
the Hutterities use more industrialized farming practices. Gene
expression data in the Amish children have been interpreted as
„intense exposure to microbes“ because protection of
experimental asthma by Amish derived house dust was nearly
abrogated in mice deficient for MyD88. But even here the
argument for any bacterial effect is not convincing as for example
Schistosome egg antigen can activate both MyD88 dependent and
independent pathways (24). Interestingly the gene-expression
profile in the Amish children (11) look very much like the profile
obtained after Fasciola infection (25).
This ecological study can not answer any of the critical questions
in the introduction. It raises again the question of possible healthy
worker effect as smaller herd size was a significant predictor of
quitting farming (26). But even if we believe in any farm effect, cow
endoparasites provide a new research strategy as DNA based
identification of most helminths is now possible (27). Studies of
helminth load would be needed in cattle, as well as in
environmental dust, in experimental animal models using
controlled exposures, as well as detailed immune profiling in
humans.
Parasite effector molecules have been largely underrated so far
with numerous candidates are being available for experimental

and clinical testing (28). This may be even in line with the current
„One Health Initiative“ of the WHO addressing the connections
between health and the environment by multidisciplinary research.
