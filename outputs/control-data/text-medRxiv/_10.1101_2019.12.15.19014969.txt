Abstract
Metacognition is the set of reflexive processes allowing humans to evaluate the
accuracy of their mental operations. Deficits in synthetic metacognition have been
described in schizophrenia using mostly narrative assessment and linked to several key
symptoms. Here, we assessed metacognitive performance by asking individuals with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N=20) and matched healthy participants (N =
21) to perform a visual discrimination task and subsequently report confidence in their
performance. Metacognitive performance was defined as the adequacy between visual
discrimination performance and confidence. Bayesian analyses revealed equivalent
metacognitive performance in the two groups despite a weaker association between
confidence and trajectory tracking during task execution among patients. These results
were reproduced using a bounded evidence accumulation model which showed similar
decisional processes in the two groups. The inability to accurately attune confidence to
perceptual decisions in schizophrenia remains to be experimentally demonstrated,
along with the way such impairments may underpin functional deficits.

Introduction
Metacognition refers to a spectrum of mental activities whose objects are the subject’s own
thoughts. Some of these mental activities can be described as discrete (recognition and
monitoring of ongoing thoughts or percepts), others as more transversal and synthetic,
integrating a subject's assumption of thoughts, sensations, intentions or links between events to
form more complete and lasting representations (Lysaker et al., 2013 ; Bob et al., 2016 ; David,
2019). Regarding the latter, individuals with schizophrenia have persistent difficulties in
considering thoughts as essentially subjective, in recognizing complex mental states in others,
in viewing events from perspectives other than their own, and in using their metacognitive
knowledge to manage their distress ​(Hasson-Ohayon et al., 2015; Lysaker & Dimaggio, 2014)​.
These deficits have been linked to core features of the illness like positive and negative
symptoms ​(McLeod, Gumley, MacBeth, Schwannauer, & Lysaker, 2014)​, disorganisation ​(Vohs
et al., 2014)​, functioning ​(Lysaker et al., 2010)​, and quality of life ​(Arnon-Ribenfeld,
Hasson-Ohayon, Lavidor, Atzil-Slonim, & Lysaker, 2017)​. Synthetic metacognition is usually
measured through structured interviews and self-reported questionnaires that evaluate multiple
processes such as emotion recognition, theory of mind and verbal abilities. In contrast, discrete
metacognition is measured by focusing on a specific cognitive domain: participants are asked to
perform a cognitive or perceptual task (sometimes referred to as the first-order task), and
subsequently assess how well they performed (i.e., a second-order task consisting of a
confidence

judgment,

error detection, or post-decisional wagering). In this context,

metacognitive performance is defined as the capacity to adapt second-order judgments to
first-order performance ​(Fleming & Lau, 2014)​.
Studies relying on such combinations of first and second-order tasks reported deficits in
metacognitive performance in schizophrenia across several domains, such as perception
(Moritz, Woznica, Andreou, & Kother, 2012)​, agency ​(Metcalfe, Van Snellenberg, DeRosse,
Balsam, & Malhotra, 2012) and memory ​(Moritz, Woodward, Jelinek, & Klinge, 2008)​. Although
these studies have provided valuable insights regarding putative deficits in discrete
metacognition, several biases might interfere with the assessment of metacognitive
performance in schizophrenia. First, it is important to consider that metacognitive performance
depends on first-order performance: it is easier to provide confidence judgments or detect errors
for simple than for difficult tasks. Thus, it is crucial to control for first-order task performance,

which is usually lower in schizophrenia compared to controls. Other biases might influence
metacognition in schizophrenia such as depression which has been associated with better
metacognition ​(Lysaker et al., 2005) and cognitive deficits that have been associated with
metacognitive impairments with a small-to-moderate effect size ​(Davies & Greenwood, 2018)​.
Considering the many stages of processing leading from first to second-order decisions, poor
metacognitive performance in a given task may be due to deficits at any of these levels.
Here, we sought to pinpoint the putative origins of metacognitive deficits in schizophrenia and
describe how first and second-order cognitive processes unfold over time by analyzing
behavioral responses together with trajectory tracking, and by reproducing them using a
bounded evidence accumulation model of decision-making. Namely, we continuously tracked
the position and kinematics of the mouse that participants used to indicate their first-order
response during a motion discrimination task ​(Dotan, Meyniel, & Dehaene, 2018; Dotan,
Pinheiro-Chagas, Al Roumi, & Dehaene, 2019)​. In addition, we modeled first and second-order
responses as derived from a bounded evidence accumulation process starting when
participants initiated a mouse movement ​(Pereira et al., 2018; Pleskac, Busemeyer, & others,
2010; Resulaj, Kiani, Wolpert, & Shadlen, 2009; Van Den Berg et al., 2016)​. Together, these

decision-making and metacognitive monitoring in schizophrenia in relation to clinical traits while
avoiding the typical confounds that may have contaminated previous results in the field.

Results
1. First and second-order performance
Twenty-three healthy volunteers (15 males, 8 females) from the general population and twenty
individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (16 males, 4 females) took part in this study.
Two healthy volunteers were excluded from the analysis, respectively due to a convergence
failure during the staircase procedure, and an estimated IQ < 70. On each trial, participants
were asked to indicate the mean motion direction of a random-dot kinetogram (RDK) by clicking
within a circular frame located on the top, to the right or to the left of the stimulus (first-order
task), and report how confident they were in their response (second-order task, see methods).
The analysis of first-order task performance revealed that individuals with schizophrenia had a
tendency to judge the RDK as moving rightward more often (criterion schizophrenia: -0.32 ±
0.15, criterion controls: 0.00 ± 0.21, t(37.7) = 2.50, p = 0.02, BF = 3.24). However, the two
groups had similar discrimination performance (d’ schizophrenia: 1.29 ± 0.08, d’ controls: 1.38 ±
0.11, t(36.7) = 0.85, p = 0.40, BF = 0.41). The variance in motion direction corresponding to
such performance as titrated with an adaptive procedure (see methods) was higher in controls
(2.01 ± 0.20) than in patients (1.59 ± 0.17, t(38.9) = 3.09, p = 0.004, BF = 10.60), indicating that
patients had reduced perceptual abilities.
At the second-order level, average confidence ratings were similar between groups
(schizophrenia: 0.71 ± 0.05; controls: 0.70 ± 0.06, t(38.4) = 0.12, p = 0.91, BF = 0.31), as well
as confidence bias defined as B-ROC (patients: -1.93 ± 0.26; controls: -2.06 ± 0.21, t(36.5) =
0.54, p = 0.59, BF = 0.35). We then estimated metacognitive efficiency (i.e., ratio between d’
and meta-d’) to capture the amount of perceptual evidence used by participants when
computing confidence estimates. We made the prior assumption that controls had higher
metacognitive efficiency (i.e., prior with Gaussian distribution of mean = 0.2 and SD = 1), based
on the difference in metacognitive accuracy between first-episode psychosis and healthy
controls recently reported by Davies and colleagues (2018). Results showed that the two groups
had similar metacognitive efficiency (schizophrenia: 0.52, highest posterior density interval =
[0.40 0.65], controls: 0.49, highest posterior density interval = [0.37 0.64]), with a Bayes factor of
0.18 supporting the absence of difference between groups (Figure 2B). Another metric of
metacognitive performance was computed, namely metacognitive sensitivity which corresponds

to the slope of the logistic regression between first-order accuracy and confidence. A similar
prior assumption for higher metacognitive efficiency in the control group was made, represented
by a steeper slope (i.e., Gaussian distribution with mean = 1, SD = 5). We chose a weakly
informative prior in the absence of published evidence. No interaction between group and
confidence was found (estimate = 0.06, highest posterior density interval = [-0.15 0.27], Bayes
factor = 0.02) (Figure 2C). Importantly, Bayes factors smaller than 0.3 both for metacognitive
efficiency and sensitivity support the null hypothesis, according to which individuals with
schizophrenia have no impairment while adjusting confidence to their performance.
Following our pre-registered plan, we then sought to assess how motor behavior related to
first-order responses modulated confidence ratings. As a first step, we quantified the
relationship between confidence, first-order accuracy and standardized reaction times between
groups using a mixed-effects linear regression including perceptual evidence as a regressor of
interest. We found a negative relationship between confidence and standardized reaction times
(estimate = -0.05 [-0.07 -0.04], evidence ratio > 4000), which indicates that confidence was high
following fast first-order responses. This relationship was modulated by first-order accuracy
(interaction accuracy * reaction times: estimate = -0.01 [-0.02 -0.01], evidence ratio = 221.22)
and group (interaction group * reaction times: estimate = 0.02 [0.00 0.04], evidence ratio =
22.26) indicating that the slope between confidence and standardized reaction times was
steeper for correct responses and for the control group. Interestingly, a similar pattern was
found for standardized second-order reaction times, with a main effect (estimate = -0.02 [-0.03
-0.01], evidence ratio = 71.73) which was stronger in the control vs. schizophrenia group
(interaction group * second-order reaction times: estimate = 0.02 [0.00 0.04], evidence ratio =
12.51). Together, these results indicate that standardized first and second-order reaction times
covary with confidence to a lesser extent in individuals with schizophrenia, suggesting they may
rely less on this input to form confidence estimates. Of note, raw first and second-order reaction
times per se did not differ between groups (t(39.0) = 1.07, p = 0.29, BF = 0.49 and t(36.0) =
1.41, p = 0.17, BF = 0.66, respectively).

were presented with a random dot kinetogram stimulus moving rightward or leftward and were asked to
report motion direction by moving the mouse cursor towards a circle presented at the top-left or top-right

response by moving a cursor on a visual analog scale (second-order response). Exemplar mouse

purposes dots and error bars that represent mean ± 95% confidence interval over participants after
rounding standardized confidence (C) and reaction times (D). The size of each dot is proportional to the
number of represented trials.

2. Trajectory tracking
Beyond reaction times, we quantified how mouse trajectories leading to first-order responses
predicted subsequent confidence judgments (see Figure 2A for raw trajectories). First, we
isolated trials in which a change of mind occurred, that is when participants started moving
towards one response circle and later changed direction towards the other (see methods).
Changes of mind corresponded respectively to 7.9 ± 2.7 % and 7.3 ± 2.9 % of total trials in the
patient and control groups (t(37.9) = 0.32, p = 0.75, BF = 0.32). Interestingly, a mixed-effects
logistic regression revealed that changes of mind were associated with lower first-order
accuracy in both groups (main effect: estimate = -0.32, z = -2.07, p = 0.04, see Figure 2B),
without significant interaction between group and accuracy (estimate = 0.18, z = 0.84, p = 0.40).
Conversely, a mixed-effects linear regression revealed that changes of mind were associated

with lower confidence (F(1,30.3) = 32.05, p < 0.001), and that this decrease was more
pronounced in controls vs. patients (interaction term: F(1,30.33) = 5.03, p = 0.03). Together,
these findings suggest that patients revised less their confidence following changes of mind that
lead to errors. Of note, the relationships between confidence, first-order accuracy and
standardized reaction times were similar to the ones mentioned above when excluding trials
with changes of mind.
Next, we assessed how the slopes of individual trajectories covaried with confidence. We found
a negative relationship between slopes and confidence (F(1,50.5) = 5.7, p = 0.02), independent
of groups and first-order accuracy (Figure 2A). This suggests that both patients and controls
moved the mouse more laterally for responses associated with high confidence, whether correct
or not. In addition, we fitted a linear model to individual trajectories and found a positive
relationship between the goodness of fit (R²) and confidence (F(1,40.1) = 17.5, p < 0.001)
independent of group and first-order accuracy, revealing that confidence ratings were higher
after responses following more linear trajectories. Of note, a trend suggested lower R² in the
patient group (F(1,37.1) = 3.73, p = 0.06). Besides spatial trajectories, we quantified how
velocity and acceleration profiles related to confidence, by fitting mixed-effects linear
regressions for each time sample across individual trials, with confidence and group as fixed
effects. Of note, we centered data to zero to account for potential motor impairment in
schizophrenia ​(Manschreck, Maher, Rucklos, & Vereen, 1982)​. For velocity, we found a main
effect of confidence indicating that velocity reached higher peaks in high confidence trials, and
an interaction between confidence and groups indicating that the positive correlation between
velocity and confidence was significant in the two groups, but stronger in the control than in the
schizophrenia group (p < 0.05 fdr-corrected, Figure S1). This interaction was explored by fitting
velocity models for each group, which showed a sustained correlation between confidence and
velocity at movement onset and offset among the control group, and a short-lived correlation at
movement onset in the patient group (Figure 2D). For acceleration, we found a main effect of
confidence, by which acceleration at movement onset reached higher values in high confidence
trials, and an interaction between confidence and group close to movement offset, by which
movement acceleration reached more negative values for healthy controls in high confidence
trials (p < 0.05 fdr-corrected figure S1). As for velocity, this interaction was explored by fitting
acceleration models for each group, which showed that the correlation between confidence and
acceleration was significant both at movement onset and offset among the control group (Figure

2D). Among patients, only a weaker correlation following movement offset was found. Together,
these results confirm the existence of kinematics correlates of confidence at the motor
execution stage, and suggest that they may be stronger predictors of confidence in healthy
individuals compared to schizophrenia patients.

To compare the underlying decision mechanisms between groups, we fitted a bounded
evidence accumulation model (Vickers, 1977; Usher & McClelland, 2001; Kiani & Shadlen,
2009; van den Berg et al., 2016) to movement onset timings and the accuracy of the initial
direction of the mouse trajectories. The decision process was modeled using two anticorrelated
race accumulators (one accumulating evidence for left choices and one for right choices).
Confidence ratings were simulated by extending the evidence accumulation process after the
initial decision ​(Pleskac et al., 2010)​. The model comprised five free parameters. The
non-decision time was the sum of the time needed before visual information started being
integrated by the evidence accumulation process and the delay between the decision and the
actual movement initiation. The ​decision bound corresponded to the amount of evidence
needed to initiate a movement and the ​drift rate to the average slope of the evidence
accumulation process. Finally, two ​confidence criteria were used to define three confidence
quantiles as used above. Similar levels of goodness of fit were obtained between groups, both
regarding first-order (log-likelihood patients: -0.41 ± 0.13; log-likelihood controls: -0.59 ± 0.13)
and second-order outcomes (log-likelihood patients: -29.50 ± 1.72; log-likelihood controls:
-25.80 ± 1.14). No differences across groups were found for the five parameters (non-decision
time: t(35.7) = 0.46, p = 0.75, BF = 0.39; decision bound: t(37.5) = 0.05, p = 0.96, BF = 0.31;
drift rate: t(35.1) = 0.01, p = 0.99, BF = 0.31; confidence criterion 1: t(37.6) = -0.04, p = 0.97, BF
= 0.31; confidence criterion 2: t(36.2) = -0.29, p = 0.77, BF = 0.32, see Figure 4). In addition,
metacognitive efficiency resulting from these simulated data was equivalent in individuals with
schizophrenia (mean estimate = 0.52, highest posterior density interval = [0.40 0.65]) and
healthy controls (mean estimate = 0.58, highest posterior density interval = [0.40 0.88]),
mimicking our behavioral results.

3. Cognitive and clinical variables
The two groups did not differ in terms of gender (χ² = 0.45, p = 0.50), age, education, premorbid
intelligence levels, and neuropsychological performance, except for the total score in the Six
Elements Test which was marginally lower for patients (mean 801.0 ± 101.4) than in controls
(mean 920.8 ± 86.4, t(37.1) = 1.76, p = 0.086, see Table 1). Two other variables differed
between patients and controls: depressive symptoms which were higher in patients (mean 0.5 ±
0.4) compared with controls (mean 4.5 ± 1.8, t(21.2) = -4.3, p < 0.001), and cognitive insight
scores which were higher in patients (mean 5.8 ± 3.2) than in controls (mean -0.6 ± 1.7, t(28.7)
= -3.4, p = 0.002). Of note, the latter difference was not significant anymore when taking into
account depression as a covariate: a linear model of insight as a function of group and
depression scores revealed a main effect of depression (beta = 0.75 ± 0.30, t(37) = 2.52, p =
0.02, BF = 102.86), but no effect of group (t(37) = 1.55, p = 0.13, BF = 1.21), suggesting that the
difference in insight between groups was explained by depression. Depressions scores were >=

6 for 45% of patients indicating a possible major depressive disorder in these participants
(Addington, Addington, Maticka-Tyndale, & Joyce, 1992)​. The CDS total score was < 6 for all
participants in the control group. Behavioral results (confidence, B-ROC) remained unchanged
when CDS total score was entered as a covariate. In the patients’ sample, the intensity of
schizophrenia was measured with the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The
mean PANSS total score was 78.5 ± 6.8, the mean positive symptoms score was 17.2 ± 2.2, the
mean negative symptoms score was 20.5 ± 2.3 and the mean general psychopathology score
was 40.9 ± 3.8. The mean illness duration was 14.7 years ± 3.7 and the mean chlorpromazine
equivalent was 439.7 mg/24h ± 118.4. The mean score on PSP was 55.7 ± 5.4 and the mean
total score on BIS was 10.8 ± 1.1. The group of patients included 13 participants with
schizophrenia and 7 with schizo-affective disorders.

We examined the relationship between second-order behavioral measures (confidence,
M-Ratio) and these cognitive and clinical variables using Bayesian robust regressions (see
methods). Regarding cognitive variables, we found that M-Ratio covaried positively with the
WAIS matrix subtest (r = 0.46, HDP = [0.20 0.70], Bayes Factor = 13.88) on the whole group of
participants, indicating that participants with good perceptual reasoning also had high
metacognitive performance. No other correlation was found significant (see Supplementary
Table S1). No significant correlation was found between second-order behavioral measures and
clinical variables specific to the patient population (see Supplementary Table S2).

Discussion
The current study sought to systematically assess the quality of metacognitive monitoring in
perceptual decision-making in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, using bias-free measures of
metacognitive performance combined with trajectory tracking and bounded evidence
accumulation models of decision-making.
Metacognitive performance
No significant difference in metacognitive efficiency and sensitivity was found between groups,
with Bayesian analyses favoring the null hypothesis rather than inconclusive results. In addition,
a bounded evidence accumulation model suggested that both groups relied on equivalent first
and second-order decisional mechanisms when compensating for first-order perceptual deficits
in patients. The absence of a difference between groups is unlikely due to abnormally poor
metacognitive performance in our control population, as healthy participants performed similarly
to participants from previous studies involving a coherent motion discrimination paradigm (e.g.,
mean M-Ratio = 0.66 in ​Konishi, Compain, Berberian, Sackur, & de Gardelle, 2019)​. Plus, the
unexpected worse cognitive insight found in patients compared to controls can not explain the
lack of difference in metacognitive performance between groups since cognitive insight was
related neither with metacognitive efficiency nor metacognitive sensitivity. One might argue that
including individuals with schizo-affective disorders might have compensated for a potential
deficit

in

metacognition in individuals with schizophrenia, by increasing depressive

symptomatology, which has been associated with better metacognitive efficiency ​(Rouault,
Seow, Gillan, & Fleming, 2018)​. However, the prevalence of possible depression (based on the
CDS cut-off) in this sample of individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was close to
the 40% value reported in another study investigating outpatients with schizophrenia only ​(an
der Heiden, Leber, & Häfner, 2016)​.
Recent studies reported lower visual metacognitive performance in individuals with a first
episode of psychosis relative to age-matched controls ​(Alkan, Davies, Greenwood, & Evans,
2019; Davies et al., 2018)​. Here, we tested individuals with a chronic disorder and found no
deterioration of metacognition relative to controls, but a negative relationship between
metacognitive efficiency and illness duration (Table S2). This suggests that metacognitive
performance in patients may evolve non-linearly over time, with prevalent deficits at the early

and late stages of schizophrenia. Longitudinal studies with large sample sizes and varying ages
of onset will be needed to assess this possibility.
Regarding chronic schizophrenia, a study reported lower metacognitive performance in a source
memory task compared to psychiatric control groups (obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic
stress disorders) with similar type-1 accuracy ​(Moritz & Woodward, 2006)​. However, our results
are in line with previous studies investigating metacognitive performance controlling for
first-order accuracy in chronic schizophrenia, which reported equivalent metacognitive sensitivity
(area under the type 2 ROC curve) between patients and controls for facial emotion recognition
(Pinkham, Klein, Hardaway, Kemp, & Harvey, 2018)​, comparable metacognitive sensitivity
(strength of the association between first-order accuracy and confidence) for episodic memory
(Bacon & Izaute, 2009)​, and comparable metacognitive efficiency (M-Ratio) during a detection
task ​(Powers, Mathys, & Corlett, 2017)​. In contrast, many studies reported a metacognitive
deficit in chronic schizophrenia without controlling for concomitant lower first-order performance
(Eifler et al., 2015; Köther et al., 2012; Moritz et al., 2008; Moritz et al., 2012)​. Therefore, an
important aspect of future studies quantifying confidence and metacognitive performance in
schizophrenia will be to systematically control for potential confounds in terms of first-order
performance.
Relationships between action execution and metacognitive performance
Reaction times were not longer in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, nor were
mouse movement onsets, maybe as a consequence of the artefactual matching of task difficulty
and accuracy between the two groups. Both groups featured a negative relationship between
reaction times and confidence, but significantly stronger in the control group. This result is in line
with a previous report showing a lack of correlation between reaction times and confidence in
emotion recognition for individuals with schizophrenia whereas reaction times were negatively
associated with confidence in controls ​(Jones et al., 2019)​. Together, these results suggest that
decisional parameters such as reaction times have less influence on subsequent confidence
ratings in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
The analysis of reaction times with a bounded evidence accumulation model revealed no
difference in parameters between groups. This is at odds with the first study employing this
technique in schizophrenia, showing that patients had an increased non-decisional time, higher

boundary separation and lower drift rate in a punishment learning task ​(Moustafa et al., 2015)​.
Longer non-decisional time and lower drift rate were also recently found for speeded judgments
among individuals with schizophrenia and their siblings compared to healthy controls ​(Fish et
al., 2018)​.
Beyond mere reaction times, we found that velocity and acceleration during the decision
movement were more closely linked to confidence in the control than in the schizophrenia
group. The link between confidence and trajectories in the control group corroborates the view
that sensorimotor signals shape confidence estimates. Indeed, previous studies showed that
electromyographic activity ​(Gajdos, Fleming, Saez Garcia, Weindel, & Davranche, 2019) and
alpha power over somatosensory scalp regions ​(Faivre, Filevich, Solovey, Kuhn, & Blanke,
2018) covary with confidence, and that altering sensorimotor signaling by increasing movement
speed ​(Palser, Fotopoulou, & Kilner, 2018) or by inducing sensorimotor conflicts ​(Faivre,
Vuillaume, et al., 2019) disrupt metacognitive accuracy. The weaker link between trajectories
and confidence in schizophrenia may be related to slower and noisier motor behavior, or to the
tendency of patients to neglect relevant internal cues to control motor actions ​(Frith, Blakemore,
& Wolpert, 2000)​. The fact that metacognitive performance was preserved in schizophrenia
despite a decreased link between confidence and trajectories suggest that sensorimotor signals
may globally up or down-regulate confidence estimates, with no influence on the calibration
between confidence and first-order performance as reported recently ​(Filevich, Koß, & Faivre,
2019)​.
Relationships between behavioral and neuropsychological outcomes
No difference was found between patients and controls according to premorbid IQ, perceptual
and verbal reasoning and working memory. Executive functions were marginally lower in
patients. In contrast, coherent motion discrimination was significantly worse in patients
compared to controls in line with previous studies ​(Chen, 2011) thus suggesting a deficient
integration of spatially distributed motion signals in patients. In the group of patients,
schizophrenic symptomatology was moderate ​(Leucht et al., 2005) and the level of depression
slightly higher than what is usually reported in stabilized outpatients sample ​(Roux et al., 2018;
Tanaka et al., 2012)​. Depressive symptomatology was also higher in patients than in controls
for the current study. Patients reported mean clinical ​(Ehrminger et al., 2019) and cognitive

Phalen, Viswanadhan, Lysaker, & Warman, 2015) insights which were comparable to those
reported in previous studies including stabilized outpatients. In contrast, cognitive insight was
markedly lower in the controls we had recruited compared to previous studies ​(Kao & Liu, 2010;
Martin, Warman, & Lysaker, 2010; Uchida et al., 2009)​, which however included much younger
and educated non-clinical participants than the ones included in the current sample. The higher
level of depression found in patients compared to controls and the low cognitive insight found in
controls regarding the level usually reported both converged to explain that cognitive insight was
unexpectedly better in patients than in controls. This difference was indeed not significant
anymore when depression was entered as a covariate. We found a significant correlation
between metacognitive efficiency and visual reasoning on the whole group of participants, which
suggests that metacognition and reasoning abilities depend on partially overlapping cognitive
mechanisms ​(Mäntylä, Rönnlund, & Kliegel, 2010)​. Previous studies reported that metamemory
correlated with executive function, visual recognition memory ​(Chiu, Liu, Hwang, Hwu, & Hua,
2015) and working memory ​(Eifler et al., 2015)​. Contrary to a previous study reporting a
significant association between poor insight and metacognitive deficits in schizophrenia ​(Koren
et al., 2004)​, we found no correlation between illness insight and metacognitive performance or
confidence bias. Plus, metacognitive performance did not correlate with psychosocial
functioning in patients. Our study thus does not confirm the significant association between
synthetic metacognition (drawing upon a broad range of social, executive, linguistic, and
metacognitive processes, such as the Metacognitive Assessment Scale) and functioning
previously reported ​(Arnon-Ribenfeld et al., 2017)​.
Conclusions
Controlling for the accuracy of first-order decisions and other important cognitive confounds like
perceptual reasoning, we found equivalent decision-making and metacognitive processes in
individuals with schizophrenia and healthy matched controls. However, confidence was less
related to the speed of decision and to motor response parameters like velocity and acceleration
in individuals with schizophrenia. This study emphasizes the importance to run future studies
controlling for first-order accuracy and reasoning before concluding that individuals with
schizophrenia have a specific metacognitive deficit.

Methods
The experimental paradigm and analysis plan detailed below were registered prior to data
collection (​NCT03140475​) and are available together with anonymized data and analyses
scripts on the open science framework (​https://osf.io/84wqp/​).
Participants
Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder)
were recruited from community mental health centers and outpatient clinics in the Versailles
area. The control participants were recruited from the volunteers' panel at the ​Centre
d’Economie de la Sorbonne and Versailles Hospital. Exclusion criteria for both groups were a
moderate-to-severe substance use disorder (DSM-5 criteria) within the 12 months preceding the
study, and a current or prior untreated medical illness, including neurologic illness, an IQ < 70
based on three subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (see below), and an age > 60
years. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders were diagnosed by M.R. based on the
Structured Clinical Interview for assessing the DSM-5 criteria ​(First, Williams, Karg, & Spitzer,
2016)​. Another licensed psychiatrist (patient’s treating psychiatrist) confirmed the diagnosis for
each patient according to the DSM-5 criteria. The control group was screened for current or past
psychiatric illness, and individuals were excluded if they met the criteria for a severe and
persistent mental disorder.
All participants were right-handed, had normal hearing and normal or corrected-to-normal
vision. They were naive to the purpose of the study and gave informed consent. The study was
approved by the ethical committee ​Sud Méditérannée II (217 R01). Our plan at pre-registration
was to collect data until we reach a Bayes Factor of either 1/3 or 3. We halted data collection
when evidence for the null hypothesis in our main test of interest was obtained (i.e., M-Ratio,
see analyses below).
Neuropsychological and clinical evaluation
Both individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and healthy controls were evaluated on
the following neuropsychological domains :

Procedure
Among multiple perceptual paradigms, coherent motion discrimination was chosen because it
had been recommended as a promising perception paradigm for translation for use in clinical
trials due to good psychometric validity ​(Green et al., 2008)​. All stimuli were prepared and
presented using the psychophysics toolbox under Matlab ​(Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007;
Pelli, 1997)​, based on a previous study ​(de Gardelle & Mamassian, 2015)​. Participants started
each trial by clicking on a 1.2° x 3.6° box placed at the bottom of the screen (Figure 1). The
mouse click triggered the display of a 0.1° fixation dot presented in the middle of a circular
frame (3° radius) for 250 ms over a gray background, followed by the display of a random dot
kinetogram (RDK), consisting of 100 dots (radius 0.1°) moving pseudo randomly at a constant

speed of 3°/s. The motion direction of each dot was drawn every 16 ms from a von Mises
distribution that determined both the mean (± 45° relative to the vertical) and variance of the
motion direction. Visual transients at stimulus onset were smoothed using a linear ramp in
contrast. On each trial, participants were asked to indicate the mean motion direction by clicking
within a circular frame (radius 1.35°) located on the top, to the right or to the left of the RDK.
Responses slower than 6 s were discouraged by playing a loud alarm sound. The task difficulty
was adjusted by a one-up two-down staircase procedure to make the first-order performance
rate converge to 71 % ​(Levitt, 1971)​. Perceptual evidence was defined as the inverse of
variance in motion direction, increasing after one incorrect response and decreasing after two
consecutive correct responses. After providing their first-order response, a visual analog scale
appeared, and participants were asked to report how confident they were about it by moving a
slider vertically using the mouse. The scale was presented until a response was provided, with
marks between 0 % (certainty that the first-order response was erroneous) and 100 % (certainty
that the first-order response was correct) with 5% steps. The initial position of the cursor was
always 50 %. The experiment was divided into 10 blocks of 30 trials and lasted about 1 hour.
The perceptual difficulty was pre-tuned to individual perceptual abilities by performing 80 trials
without confidence ratings prior to the main experiment.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed with R (2018). We compared groups’ characteristics using the
Welch t-test or χ2 test when appropriate. Trials in which reaction times were above 6 s or below
200 ms were excluded (first-order responses: 2.2 ± 0.9 % of total trials; second-order response
1.5 ± 0.7 %). All Bayesian models were created in Stan computational framework
(​http://mc-stan.org/​) accessed with the brms package ​(Bürkner, 2017)​, based on four chains of
10000 iterations including 2000 warmup samples. We report the highest density probability for
all estimates, which specifies the range covering the 95% most credible values of the posterior
estimates. Mixed-effects models included random intercepts by participants and full random
effects structure. Metacognitive sensitivity was quantified using a mixed-effects logistic
regression between first-order accuracy and confidence, including a fixed effect of group
(controls vs. patients). Metacognitive efficiency was quantified in a Bayesian framework as the
ratio between meta-d’ and d’ (M-Ratio) ​(Fleming, 2017; Maniscalco & Lau, 2012)​. Confidence
bias quantified differences in the tendency to use high or low confidence ratings. It was
calculated based on the second-order receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) which

determines the rate of correct and incorrect responses at given confidence levels. Namely,
confidence bias corresponded to the log-ratio between the lower and upper area separated by
the minor diagonal (B-ROC) ​(Kornbrot, 2006)​. Mouse spatial trajectories (X, Y), and kinematics
(instantaneous velocity and acceleration) associated with first-order responses were smoothed
using a Savitzky-Golay filter of order 2 and length 5. Trajectories were temporally realigned with
respect to movement onset, defined as the time when velocity reached 20% of the maximal
velocity in a given trial. Trajectories were spatially realigned with respect to the spatial
coordinate at movement onset (i.e., starting point). Spatial coordinates were fitted using a model
II linear regression with the major axis method ​(Legendre, 2018)​. Kinematics (velocity,
acceleration) were standardized across participants (z-score) and analyzed as a function of
confidence using mixed-effects linear regressions. Changes of mind were defined as trials in
which the sign of the trajectory angle at movement onset was opposite to that of the landing
point (i.e, when participants started moving towards one side of the screen but ended
responding on the other side). Only initial angles with an absolute value between 10 and 80
degrees were considered to exclude trials with vertical or horizontal trajectories at movement
onset. Robust Bayesian correlations were computed using Stan with 10000 iterations including
2000 warmup samples and non-informative priors, assuming that pairs of psychometric and
behavioral outcomes followed a bivariate Student’s t-distribution.
Bounded accumulation model
To reduce the degrees of freedom of the model, we fixed the standard deviation of the
non-decision time to 60 ms, the standard deviation of the within-trial noise to 1 and the
correlation of the two accumulators to -sqrt(0.5) as in previous works ​(e.g. Van Den Berg et al.,
2016)​. The accumulation process was bounded negatively to zero. We used Euler’s method to
simulate 1000 trials of the evidence accumulation process and the corresponding response
times (i.e. movement onsets) and choice accuracies (i.e. accuracy of the movement direction at
the onset), which were fitted to the observed data for every participant. For this, we maximized
the log-likelihood using a Nelder-Mead simplex method. The log-likelihood was computed using
a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the simulated and observed movement onset times,
inverting their sign when the direction was incorrect. We repeated this procedure with a wide
range of initial parameters to avoid local minima. We fitted confidence ratings in a second stage;
we simulated 1000 paths of the evidence accumulation process and discretized the winning
accumulator (at a fixed readout time after the decision) into three confidence levels using two

criteria. The values of the two criteria were initialized to approximate the proportion of high and
low confidence ratings and then fitted to the data using a Nelder-Mead simplex method. For this,
we computed the log-likelihood using a Bernoulli probability distribution for each confidence
level and choice accuracy. We repeated this procedure using readout timings going from 0 s
after the initial decision to 1 s after the initial decision by steps of 100 ms and used the model
with the best likelihood. Of note, our results still held when using fixed readout times across
participants or when fitting confidence ratings to the state of the loosing accumulator ​(Kiani &
Shadlen, 2009) or to the difference between the winning and losing accumulator
