ABSTRACT

Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a frequent pathology that causes significant

harm to the well-being and quality of life of pregnant women. This study aimed to

measure the prevalence and to identify factors associated with the occurrence of UI

during pregnancy in women living in the municipality of Rio Grande (RS), Southern

Brazil,

in

2016.

BACKGROUND

Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as any involuntary loss of urine

(1)

. It occurs

in both genders and increases with age. Among women, its occurrence ranges from

40% to 60% and among men from 10% to 20%

(2)

.

This higher occurrence among women is generally due to their reproductive

life

(3)

. Hormonal changes, enlargement of the uterus, pelvic floor changes during

gestation and trauma suffered during delivery lead to involuntary loss of urine

(4-6)

.

UI during gestation is an important predictor for its presence in subsequent

pregnancies and at a later age

(7)

. This makes it a chronic disease with a substantial

deterioration of the quality of life, whether due to discomfort, the need for constant

personal hygiene or insecurity, among others. At a later age, UI leads to isolation,

which favors depression and more severe psychiatric conditions

(8,9)

.

While very prevalent, UI has been poorly studied at the population level in

Brazil. The few available studies are performed with a very small number of pregnant

women, usually from a single health service, without any type of representativeness

at the population level

(10-12)

. In addition to preventing the establishment of actions

and programs due to lack of knowledge of the real magnitude of the problem, this

hinders prevention at the primary level of health care, which contributes to the

persistence and severity of this disease, increases suffering and worsens the quality

of life of these women, especially in the gestational period and in the older age.

This study aims to measure the prevalence and to identify factors associated with

the

occurrence

of

UI

in

the

gestational

period

among

puerperae

living

in

the

municipality

of

Rio

municipality of Rio Grande (RS), Southern Brazil during 2016.

METHODS

With

a

little

more

than

210

thousand

inhabitants,

the

Grande is located in the southern coastal strip of the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS),

about 300 km from the capital, Porto Alegre. Agribusiness, port activity and fishing

are the main economic activities of the municipality. By 2015, its economy generated

a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of approximately US$ 12,000. In that

same year, the infant mortality rate was 15 per thousand live births

since

2007.

These

evaluations aim to monitor the quality of gestation and delivery assistance provided

in this municipality.

municipality of Rio Grande (in urban or rural areas), must have had a child in one of

the two local maternity hospitals (Santa Casa de Misericórdia or University Hospital)

from January 1 to December 31, 2016 with a birth weight equal to or greater than

500 grams or with at least 20 weeks of gestational age.

The cross-sectional design was used, and mothers were approached only once

in the maternity ward within 48 hours after delivery.

Regarding the sample size, two calculations were performed, namely, one to

estimate prevalence and the other to identify associated factors. In the first case,

using the expected prevalence of UI of 15%, error margin of 1.5 percentage points,

level of significance of 95% and losses of 10%, the study should include at least 2,334

puerperae. Regarding the identification of associated factors, for alpha error of 0.05,

If in the municipality of Rio Grande, they would receive information on the study and,

if they agreed to participate, they would sign two copies of the Informed Consent

Form (ICF) and retain one copy. The other copy would be filed at the headquarters of

this study. At least once a month, the team would meet with the project coordinator

(JAC) to address any unclear issues, evaluate the application of questionnaires and

review data collected via REDCap.

Questionnaires were uploaded daily through the REDCap Web platform

them had UI until the end of gestation.

Table 2 shows that the prevalence of UI ranged from 8.3% among adolescents

(under 20 years) to 39.2% among those who reported frequent urinary urgency.

In

the adjusted analysis, the PR for puerperae aged 30 years or older was 2.05 (95% CI:

1.39-3.01) in relation to adolescents; mothers who had their first pregnancy aged 30

years or older, or before the age of 20, had PR=1.59 (95% CI: 1.01-2.51) and 1,36

(95% CI: 1.04-1.76), respectively, compared to those who had their first pregnancy at

20-29 years. In this same table, it is possible to verify that the greater the weight at

the end of pregnancy, the higher the PR for UI occurrence. PR for the occurrence of

Finally, regular physical exercise during pregnancy and reporting frequent urinary

DISCUSSION

This study found a prevalence of UI in the gestational period of 14.7%. It also

showed that the probability of this disease, even after adjustment, is significantly

higher among pregnant women who got pregnant and/or had a child in adolescence,

who weighed 90 kg or more at the end of gestation, who performed regular physical

exercises and who reported frequent urinary urgency during the gestational period.

The prevalence of UI found in this survey is low compared to other studies,

ranging from 15%

(21)

to 71%

(11)

. This enormous discrepancy arises from different

characteristics of the participants, such as the inclusion of nulliparous alone, and the

diagnostic criteria used, often based on a single question of the event of involuntary

urine loss

(22-24)

.

Maternal age is an inexorable marker of the occurrence of UI. The greater the

age, the greater its prevalence. This is due to the loss of innervation and gradual

reduction in the contraction capacity of muscle fibers and increased permeability of

the urethral sphincter

(25)

. This leads to a lower pressure of its closure

(26)

, resulting in

the involuntary loss of urine. A recent systematic review conducted in the European

population found OR=1.4 (95% CI: 1.3-1.5) for UI among those 35 years of age or

older compared to younger age

(21)

. A similar result was found in this study. Mothers

aged 20-29 years and 30 years or older showed a PR for UI of 1.64 (95% CI: 1.13-2.38)

and

2.05

(95%

CI:

1,

39-3.01),

respectively.

This

evidences

the

strength

of

the

variable age as a risk factor for this condition.

Maternal age at the time of the first gestation was also significantly associated

with the probability of UI in the studied population. A similar finding was found in a

cross-sectional study conducted in Norway with about 11,000 women

(27)

. In this

study, women with gestation before 25 years of age showed a prevalence of UI of

23% versus 28% among those who had a child at a later age (p> 0.001). In this study

from

Rio

Grande,

having

a

child

at

20-29

years

showed

the

lowest

risk

of

UI

compared to those who had it before the age of 20 or after the age of 30. This is

probably due to pelvic floor trauma at younger ages and loss of muscle fibers and

urethral sphincter pressure at later ages.

In this study, weighing over 90 kg at the end of gestation showed PR=1.63 (95%

CI: 1.17-2.27) in relation to the others. The relationship between body mass index

(BMI)

and

established

UI

is

usually

directly

proportional.

This

risk

factor

is

already

well

(28,29)

. This may not only be due to the relationship between weight and

height, but also that the gestational period shows an increased bone density and

peripheral edema, in addition to the influence of hormonal factors and fetal weight.

This set of factors may be responsible for increased weight gain being an important

risk factor for UI.

In Rio Grande, regular physical exercise, even after adjustment, appeared as a

predisposing factor to UI in relation to the other pregnant women. This is even more

worrying

because,

during

pregnancy,

it

is

common

for

obstetricians

to

indicate

physical exercise, called "fitness", for pregnant women. They claim the benefits of

this practice to maternal-fetal health and, because of this, are included in several

guidelines as a healthy measure for gestation

(30)

.

It is well known that, even at a young age, elite female athletes have a higher

prevalence of UI. This prevalence can affect about half of them

(31)

. A Norwegian

study conducted among academy instructors, including Pilates and Yoga teachers,

found a prevalence of UI of 26.4% among instructors with a mean age of 32.8 years

musculature training (PFMT), it has been effective in reducing the occurrence of UI,

with RR=0.71 (95% CI: 0, 54-0.95) compared to those who did not perform this type

of training

(33)

. Also on this subject, a meta-analysis showed that PFMT, by reducing

labor time, especially in the first and second stages reduces pelvic floor trauma and,

therefore, can prevent the occurrence of UI

(34)

.

About 40% of pregnant women in this study reported urinary urgency, that is,

a sudden sensation that makes it very hard to postpone urination. Of these, about

six percent referred to this condition as very frequently. The PR for the probability of

UI of this group among those who did not report urinary urgency was very high at

2.90 (95% CI: 2.10-4.00). The association between urgency and incontinence is so

close that it was set in the immediate upper level of the endpoint, showing the

relevance of this condition to the occurrence of UI.
