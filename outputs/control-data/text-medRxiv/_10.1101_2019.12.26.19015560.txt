Abstract
Background: Within many sub-Saharan African countries including Malawi, HIV prevalence
varies widely between regions. This variability may be related to the distribution of population
groups with specific sociobehavioural characteristics that influence the transmission of HIV
and the uptake of prevention. In this study, we intended to identify groups of people in Malawi
with similar risk profiles.
Methods: We used data from the Demographic and Health Survey in Malawi from 2016, and
stratified the analysis by sex. We considered demographic, socio-behavioural and HIV-related
variables. Using Latent Class Analysis (LCA), we identified clusters of people sharing common
sociobehavioural characteristics. The optimal number of clusters was selected based on the
Bayesian information criterion. We compared the proportions of individuals belonging to the
different clusters across the three regions and 28 districts of Malawi.
Results: We found nine clusters of women and six clusters of men. Most women in the
clusters with highest risk of being HIV infected were living in female-headed households and
were formerly married or in a union. Among men, older men had the highest risk of being HIV
infected, followed by young (20-25) single men. Generally, low HIV testing uptake correlated
with lower risk of having HIV. However, rural adolescent girls had a low probability of being
tested (48.7%) despite a relatively high HIV prevalence. Urban districts and Southern region
had a higher percentage of high-prevalence and less tested clusters of individuals than other
areas.
Conclusions: LCA is an efficient method to find clusters of people sharing common HIV risk
profiles, identify particularly vulnerable population groups, and plan targeted interventions
focusing on these groups. Tailored support, prevention and HIV testing programmes should
focus particularly on female household heads, adolescent girls living in rural areas, older
married men, and young men who have never been married.

Introduction
Diagnosis of HIV infected people is a critical step to improve access to treatment and control
the HIV epidemic. In Eastern and Southern Africa, where HIV prevalence is the highest in the
world [1], progress has been made to scale up HIV testing. The proportion of people living
with HIV who know their status increased from 77% in 2015 to 85% in 2018[1]. In order to
keep up with the progress and identify the remaining HIV infected people, testing programs
should better target those who are most at risk of having HIV.
Within many sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, HIV prevalence varies widely between
regions. This heterogeneity may result from the spatial distribution of population groups with
specific sociobehavioural characteristics that promote or impede the transmission of HIV and
the uptake of preventive measures. Improving our understanding of the characteristics of
different groups in the population, their risk of being HIV infected and their uptake of HIV
testing is essential to design more targeted and tailored prevention and care programs.
Clustering analysis, which is an unsupervised machine learning technique, allows us to identify
similarity patterns and find hidden sub-groups of people with potentially different risk levels
and drivers of having or acquiring HIV[2]. In a previous study, we investigated differences
between SSA countries and identified sociobehavioural profiles that coincided with a high HIV
prevalence and incidence at the country level[3]. However, this past study did not consider
sub-national differences. Moreover, previous studies on high-risk groups in SSA countries
mainly focused on women and excluded men[4–6]. Most of these studies also did not analyse
the spatial distribution of the identified groups across the country. A recent study mapped
high-risk men and women across Malawi to study whether their distribution could explain the
spatial variability of HIV prevalence in the country, but the definition of high-risk behaviour
was based only on the total number of lifetime sexual partners of individuals[7].
In the present study, we aimed to identify and characterize vulnerable groups who are most
at risk of being HIV positive in Malawi. We used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify clusters
of men and women with different sociobehavioural characteristics, based on the latest
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)[8] of Malawi. We also compared the most common
clusters across the three regions and 28 districts of Malawi.

Methods
Data
We used data from the latest available DHS (2015-2016) for Malawi. The DHS programme
collects nationally representative data and covers a wide range of indicators for population
and health.
We considered datasets (Table S1) that contained the survey responses of men (aged 15-54
years) and women (15-49), and their HIV status (positive, negative, unknown). Two
researchers (AM and OK) preselected the following variables because they covered topics that
could be related to the HIV epidemic: place of residence (rural; urban), age (≤19; 20 to 25; 26
to 35; >35 years), literacy (can read a complete sentence: yes; no), access to media at least
once a week (yes; no), currently employed (yes; no), marital status (formerly married or lived
in a union; currently married or living in a union; never married nor lived in a union), sex of
household head (female; male), age at first sexual intercourse (<16; 16 to 18; 19 to 21; >21),
condom use (wife justified to ask husband to use a condom when he has a sexually transmitted
infection (STI); not justified), wife beating (at least one reason justifies wife beating; no reason
justifies it), comprehensive correct knowledge about AIDS (yes; no), and prior HIV testing (ever
been tested; never tested). We also considered the district and region of residence of
respondents for mapping.

Analysis
We conducted separate analyses for women and men. Since our study focused on sexual
transmission of HIV, we excluded persons who never had sexual intercourse. We used multiple
imputation by chained equations (MICE)[9,10] to complete missing data (Supplementary
Material). Some implausible or inconsistent values were set to missing before imputation.
We identified clusters of people sharing common sociobehavioural characteristics using
LCA[11], a multivariate technique that groups individuals with similar characteristics in latent
(i.e. not directly observable) classes (clusters). We used maximum likelihood estimation to
calculate the probability of an individual belonging to a cluster. We selected the number of
clusters that minimized the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)[12]. We performed the final
analysis based on a subset of variables identified as the most important for clustering
(Supplementary Material). We selected these variables for men and women separately based
on the overall variance of their categories’ probabilities across the clusters, similarly to the
method by Dean and Raftery[13]. Reducing the number of variables allows us to reduce the
number of clusters, thus facilitating interpretability.
We analyzed the HIV prevalence and the uptake of HIV testing in each LCA cluster. We
defined HIV prevalence as the proportion of positive tests among the positive and negative
tests results. We also analyzed the distribution of the clusters across regions and districts,
and assessed whether it could help to explain the wide spatial variability of HIV prevalence.
We conducted the analysis using the open source R language, version 3.5.1. We used the
implementation of LCA provided in the poLCA package, version 1.4.1[14,15]. The code is
available on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/AzizaM/dhs_malawi_lca).

Results
The survey we used included 24,562 women and 7,478 men. After imputing incomplete data
and removing respondents who never had sexual intercourse, we performed the analysis on
21,564 women and 6,379 men. The HIV status was known for 6,750 women (5,889 HIV
negative; 861 HIV positive) and 5,642 men (5,168 HIV negative; 474 HIV positive).

Women’s clusters
We found an optimal number of nine clusters for women based on seven variables: age,
literacy, marital status, location of residence, sex of household head, having ever been tested
for HIV, and employment (Table 1). Two clusters had a high HIV prevalence (Clusters 2 and 8).
Cluster 8 had an HIV prevalence of 37.2%, and was predominantly urban (100.0%) and literate
(87.8%). Cluster 2 had a prevalence of 21.2%, and was predominantly rural (96.6%). In
comparison, other clusters had a median HIV prevalence of 10.0% (IQR 7.9%-12.3%). Clusters
2 and 8 both had high proportions of female-headed households (100.0% and 83.2%,
respectively) and most women had lived in a union before (76.2% and 59.1%, respectively).
HIV testing uptake was relatively low in Clusters 1 and 9 (48.7% in Cluster 1; 47.1% in Cluster
9) compared to other clusters where the median HIV testing uptake was 96.8% (IQR 94.1%99.1%). Cluster 9 had a low HIV prevalence (2.1%) and consisted mainly of older (46.5% over
35 years) women who lived in rural areas (97.3%) and had a low level of literacy (29.4%). These
women generally lived in a union (95.4%) and their household was male-headed (88.7%). In
Cluster 1, the HIV prevalence was higher (7.7%). This cluster included literate (73.3%),
adolescent (77.8% under 20 years) girls who lived in rural (84.6%) areas and had never been
in a union (94.2%). HIV testing uptake was approximately two-fold higher (96.8%) in Cluster 4
than Cluster 1 (48.7%), although their HIV prevalence were similar (8.0% in Cluster 4 vs. 7.7%
in Cluster 1). Cluster 4 was characterized by young (83.1% aged between 20 and 35), rural
(100.0%) and married (95.3%) women.
Figure 1 and Table S2 present the distributions of the clusters of women in the Northern,
Central and Southern regions of Malawi. The Southern region included a higher percentage
(7.2%) of rural, literate, adolescent girls, who had never been in a union and who had a low
uptake of HIV testing (Cluster 1); and a lower percentage (10.8%) of well tested married
women aged over 20 (Cluster 6) than the Central (Cluster 1, 6.0%; Cluster 6, 16.7%) and
Northern (Cluster 1, 3.3%; Cluster 6, 15.1%) regions. The Southern region had also a higher
percentage (17.0%) of rural divorced/widowed women with a female household head and a
high HIV prevalence (Cluster 2) than the other regions (13.1% in the Central and 9.6% in the
Northern regions). In contrast, the Northern region had a higher percentage (32.5%) of young
rural married women (Cluster 4) with a high HIV testing uptake than the Central (21.6%) and
Southern (23.2%) regions.
The distribution of clusters of women varied also across the 28 districts of Malawi (Table S3).
Figure 2 presents the proportion of the nine clusters in five selected districts that cover all
three regions of the country: Chitipa (Northern), Salima (Central), Lilongwe (Central), Blantyre
(Southern) and Chikwawa (Southern region). We selected two neighbouring districts from the
same region (Salima and Lilongwe in the Central region; Chikwawa and Blantyre in the
Southern region) because they had remarkably different HIV prevalence (5.2% in Salima vs

9.2% in Lilongwe; 9.1% in Chikwawa vs 24.1% in Blantyre). Table S4 and Figure S1 present the
HIV prevalence per district for women and men. In both Central and Southern regions, the
districts with higher HIV prevalence (Lilongwe and Blantyre) contained the two largest cities
of Malawi, and therefore were characterized by a lower level of rural clusters (Clusters 1, 2, 3
and 4), and a higher percentage of more urban clusters (Clusters 5, 6, 7 and 8). In the Southern
region, Cluster 9, which is 97.3% rural and has the lowest HIV prevalence, was substantially
more common in Chikwawa than in Blantyre (7.2% vs 1.0%), unlike in the Central region where
its proportion was similar in Salima and Lilongwe (2.4%; 3.1%). Similarly to districts with lower
HIV prevalence in the Central and Southern regions of Malawi, in Chitipa (Northern region) a
relatively high percentage of people belonged to rural clusters, such as Cluster 3 (33.9%),
Cluster 4 (29.4%) and Cluster 9 (5.6%), whereas urban clusters, such as Cluster 5 (1.7%), Cluster
7 (2.2%) and Cluster 8 (1.7%), were much less common. But Chitipa had also a lower
percentage of Cluster 1 (1.7%; less tested and mainly rural with relatively high HIV prevalence,
vs. 10.0% in Salima and 7.0% in Chikwawa) and a lower percentage of Cluster 2 (7.8%; rural
with high HIV prevalence and female-headed households, vs. 16.9% in Salima and 12.2% in
Chikwawa). Chitipa also had a higher percentage of women from Cluster 6 (16.1%; well tested,
literate, employed women, who were living in union, with a male household head, vs. 9.6% in
Salima and 5.9% in Chikwawa).

Men’s clusters
The optimal number of clusters for men was six based on 11 variables: age, age at first sex,
marital status, location of residence, having ever been tested for HIV, media access,
employment, literacy, sex of household head, wife beating justification, and willingness to use
condom (Table 2). Compared to women, men had a lower HIV prevalence (8.4% vs 12.7%);
and a lower uptake of HIV testing. The percentage of men who had never been tested for HIV
was three times higher than for women (22.5% vs 7.6%). Two clusters of men, Clusters 3 and
5, had a particularly low testing uptake (52.5% and 35.0%; vs. a range of 80.5% to 92.2% in
other clusters). Although literacy was substantially different between these clusters (97.7% in
Cluster 3; 29.7% in Cluster 5), men in both clusters had many similar characteristics: they were
mainly adolescents (77.7% under 20 years in Cluster 3; 70.3% in Cluster 5), had never lived in
a union (96.0% in Cluster 3; 98.2% in Cluster 5), and lived in rural settings (80.3% in Cluster 3;
97.2% in Cluster 5). These clusters also had the lowest HIV prevalence (0.8% and 0.5%).
The clusters of men with the highest HIV prevalence were Clusters 1 and 4 (10.0% in Cluster
1; 13.0% in Cluster 4). These clusters represented 31.2% and 31.7% of all men, respectively,
and had a relatively high HIV testing uptake (80.5% in Cluster 1; 86.6% in Cluster 4). They both
had a high proportion of older men (48.3% aged over 35 in Cluster 1; 59.0% in Cluster 4), who
were mainly living in a union (92.0% in Cluster 1; 97.6% in Cluster 4). The household heads
were also mostly men (93.6% in Cluster 1; 97.6% in Cluster 4). In contrast, Cluster 4 was more
urban than Cluster 1 (25.4% vs 3.2%), and access to media in it was better (74.4% vs 33.0%).
The cluster with the third highest HIV prevalence was Cluster 2 (6.4%). This cluster had a high
proportion of young men (72.7% between 20 and 25 years old), who were literate (87.1%) and
had never lived in a union (83.1%). In comparison to Cluster 2, Cluster 6, which included mainly
men who were literate (97.8%), aged between 20 and 35 (96.1%), had regular access to media
(77.2%), and were living in a union (100.0%) and in rural settings (79.3%), had a lower HIV
prevalence (3.9%) and a higher HIV testing uptake (92.2% in Cluster 6 vs. 86.3% in Cluster 2).

Figure S1 and Table S5 present the percentage of each cluster of men in the Northern, Central
and Southern regions of Malawi. The distribution of these clusters did not vary much between
the three regions. It varied more between districts (Table S6). Figure 3 presents the proportion
of the six clusters in the districts of Chitipa (Northern), Salima (Central), Lilongwe (Central),
Blantyre (Southern) and Chikwawa (Southern region). In both Central and Southern regions,
the districts with higher HIV prevalence (Lilongwe; Blantyre) were characterized by a lower
proportion of older men (over 35) living in rural areas, who were in a union and did not have
regular access to media (22.8% of Cluster 1 in Lilongwe vs 36.5% in Salima; 15.0% in Blantyre
vs 30.7% in Chikwawa). Lilongwe and Blantyre also had a lower percentage of rural, illiterate
adolescents with a low HIV prevalence (4.9% of Cluster 5 in Lilongwe; 3.3% in Blantyre) than
Salima and Chikwawa (14.5% of Cluster 5 in Salima; 12.2% in Chikwawa). Higher HIV
prevalence coincided also with a higher percentage of young, literate men, who had never
lived in a union (18.5% of Cluster 2 in Lilongwe vs 9.4% in Salima; 23.0% in Blantyre vs 7.8 % in
Chikwawa), and a higher proportion of older (over 35) men, who were living in a union and
had regular access to media (36.3% of Cluster 4 in Lilongwe vs 21.0% in Salima; 42.0% in
Blantyre vs 35.1% in Chikwawa). Both districts of the Southern region (Blantyre and Chikwawa)
were characterized by a lower proportion of literate, married men, who were aged 20-35 and
lived in rural settings (4.7% of Cluster 6 in Blantyre; and 4.9% in Chikwawa vs 10.2%),
compared to Chitipa (Northern region). In contrast, Chitipa was characterized by a lower
percentage of rural, illiterate, adolescent men (5.1% of Cluster 6) than the rural districts of
Southern and Central regions (12.2% in Chikwawa; 14.5% in Salima).

Discussion
Using LCA, we categorized Malawian women into nine clusters and men into six clusters with
common sociobehavioural characteristics. Among these clusters, we identified profiles of
women and men who were most at risk of being HIV infected and less tested for HIV. Female
household heads bore the heaviest burden of HIV infection, and rural adolescent girls had a
significantly lower HIV testing uptake despite a relatively high HIV prevalence. Among men,
older ones were the most affected by HIV, followed by young men who had never been
married. Mapping the identified clusters across the regions and districts of Malawi showed
that the clusters most vulnerable to HIV (higher prevalence and lower testing) were more
frequent in the Southern region and the urban districts of the country.
The clusters of women with the highest HIV prevalence were characterized by an older age
(over 25 years), living in a female-headed household and having lived formerly in a union. This
finding is consistent with earlier studies that showed that women who were no longer in a
union were most-at-risk of being HIV infected in Malawi[4]. The most common group of
female household heads in Malawi are widows[16], and it is well possible that their husband
died of AIDS. Indeed, the proportion of widows and orphans increased over time in the most
HIV-affected countries[17]. Female household heads were also shown to live more frequently
in poverty, requiring support from dedicated programmes[16,18].
The uptake of HIV testing in the identified clusters was generally consistent with the risk of
being infected by HIV, with more persons being tested for HIV when HIV prevalence was high.
Adolescents (<20 years) were tested much less frequently than adults[19–21]. The low HIV
testing uptake among adolescents is concerning, because the proportion of young people (1524) among all AIDS-related deaths in Malawi increased from 3.1% to 11.5% between 2004 and
2018[1]. In particular, rural adolescent girls, who have never lived in a union, were tested
about half as much as older (20-35 years), rural, literate women, who were living in a union,
and had a similar relatively high HIV prevalence. Yet, adolescent girls are a vulnerable cluster
that often lack knowledge about HIV[19], tend to perceive themselves as being at low risk of
HIV[22], and are prime targets of gender-based violence[23]. These observations confirm the
need to accelerate tailored HIV prevention programming among adolescents in general, and
specifically among rural adolescent girls[24].
Men tended to have a lower HIV prevalence than their female counterparts, confirming the
gender disparity in HIV infection in SSA[25,26]. Men were also less often tested for HIV, which
could be influenced by harmful masculinity stereotypes and cultural norms that inhibit men
from seeking care[27,28]. It may also result from the focus of HIV prevention in recent years
on women and girls, and HIV testing being routinely performed in antenatal care. UNAIDS’
report released in 2017[29] highlighted the low utilisation of health services by men and
qualified it as a blind spot in the response to HIV. Men have therefore a higher risk of HIV
transmission to their partners, and eventually a higher mortality rate due to AIDS-related
illnesses, affecting directly their families.
HIV prevalence was associated with the age and partnership status of men across the clusters.
Older men (>35 years) had the highest HIV prevalence regardless of their place of residence,
literacy, or access to media. Compared to 2016, HIV incidence in Malawi was nearly three

times higher in year 2000[1], which can explain the higher risk of HIV acquisition among men
who were young adults at that time. The current lower willingness to condom utilisation
among rural, less educated, older and married men[30,31] may also contribute to higher risk
of recent HIV acquisition. Among young men, living in a union and in a rural setting was
associated with a reduced risk of HIV. This finding is in agreement with a recent study
performed in South Africa, where single never married men had a high risk of being HIV
infected, which may be associated with a higher frequency of less stable relations and multiple
sexual partners[32].
Clusters of women and men with high prevalence of HIV and low HIV testing coverage were
more frequent in urban areas of Malawi. Palk and Blower[7] showed that urban areas of
Malawi also had a higher density of individuals with a high number of lifetime sexual partners.
Women and men in the mostly rural Northern region were generally well tested. Our finding
is in agreement with a recent study, which also reported a regional variance of HIV testing
uptake in Malawi, with a better testing uptake in the North, although the latter study focused
on men only[13].
Our work has some limitations. The analysis was based on a limited number of factors that
were selected by the researchers based on prior knowledge from the available literature. In
order to avoid the subjective selection of the variables in the future, we are working in parallel
on an automatic method to select the most important variables to predict individual HIV
status. Our preliminary results showed that most of the variables that we selected in this study
were highly relevant to predict HIV. Our analysis allowed us to identify clusters of men and
women with associated probabilities of being HIV infected and tested for HIV, but the crosssectional nature of our analysis does not allow us to draw causal relations. There are other
methods, such as Bayesian network analyses, that attempt to determine the possible causal
pathways between various risk factors and HIV[33]. The data we used are also potentially
biased because they are self-reported (ex. more educated people may be less keen to admit
gender-based violence or non-willingness to use condoms).
In conclusion, using LCA to identify and map vulnerable clusters of women and men can
provide key information to policy makers, enabling them to strategically design tailored
support and prevention programs that target people who are most in need. Our results clearly
demonstrated that rural adolescent girls, young single men, and married men aged over 35
years have a particularly high risk of being infected by HIV. Efforts should be made to increase
the coverage of HIV testing in particular among these sub-populations.
