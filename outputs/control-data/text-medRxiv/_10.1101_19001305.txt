Abstract
Meta-analytic methods are powerful resources to summarize the existing
evidence concerning a given research question, and are widely used in many academic
fields. However, meta-analyses can be vulnerable to various sources of bias, which
should be considered to avoid inaccuracies. Many of these sources can be related to
study authorship, as both methodological choices and researcher bias may lead to
deviations in results between different research groups. In this work, we describe a
method to objectively attribute study authorship within a given meta-analysis to different
research groups by using graph cluster analysis of collaboration networks. We then
provide empirical examples of how the research group of origin can impact effect size in
distinct types of meta-analyses, demonstrating how non-independence between withingroup results can bias effect size estimates if uncorrected. Finally, we show that
multilevel random-effects models using research group as a level of analysis can be a
simple tool for correcting biases related to study authorship.

Introduction
The scientific process is prone to several types of bias that can undermine the
reliability of the research literature1. The origins and consequences of this problem have
been extensively described; however, attempts at solutions have so far been insufficient,
as recent analyses of the literature indicate that issues such as publication2,3 and
sponsorship4 biases are still widespread. Moreover, intrinsic aspects of the current
publication, peer-review and reward systems have been shown to lead to bias towards
overly positive and inflated results5–7.
As a consequence of bias in the original studies, summarizations and metaanalysis of the existing literature can lead to misleading outcomes8,9. Moreover, the
meta-analytic process itself can be biased by the selective inclusion of studies10. On the
other hand, meta-analyses can also be used to detect and quantify sources of bias. A
number of methods have been created for this purpose, focusing mainly on publication
and reporting biases11,12, as well as study quality assessment13. However, other sources
of bias have received less attention, and new approaches are needed for their systematic
study.
A possible source of bias in meta-analyses is the non-independence between
study results, which violates the assumptions usually required by statistical models used
for data synthesis. When groups of non-independent results are easily identifiable (e.g.
outcomes from the same experiment or experiments within the same article), these can
be accounted for by diverse methods14 When analyzing articles containing several
experiments or cohorts, using multilevel models is a way to consider the dependencies
within articles15. If different outcomes from the same subjects within an experiment are
included, leading to non-independence between sampling errors as well, multivariate
meta-analyses can be applied16. Nevertheless, other sources of non-independence can
be harder to detect or approach objectively.

The research group of origin of a study is an obvious source of non-independence
between results. Certain authors or groups might be more prone to find certain
outcomes, either due to methodological factors (i.e. use of particular protocols, methods
or populations) or to biases in performing, analyzing or reporting experiments17. As
different research groups will not contribute equally to a meta-analysis, this
phenomenon, which we will refer to as authorship bias, can potentially distort metaanalytical results. Nevertheless, objective detection of authorship bias is hampered by
the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a research group. As academic mobility
is high, collaboration is frequent and authorship criteria are flexible, it is unlikely that two
sets of studies from a group will have exactly the same set of authors. At the same time,
it is not clear at what point differences between author lists become large enough to
attribute studies to different groups.
In this work, we describe a straightforward method to define research groups
based on collaboration graphs, which can be used to assess and quantify authorship
bias in a meta-analysis. To demonstrate its usefulness, we apply this procedure in
different meta-analyses to show that results coming from the same research group can
impact results in various ways, leading to potential misinterpretations of the data. We
then demonstrate how the use of multilevel random-effects models based on author
networks can correct effect size estimation in these cases. The use of these tools might
not only increase precision in data synthesis, but also provide a window to study the
impact of authorship on results in different fields of research.

Methods
Selection of meta-analyses examples and data extraction
As shown in the study outline presented in Fig. 1, we extracted data from four
meta-analyses to test our method for research group definition and evaluation of
authorship bias. We chose meta-analyses from different fields of biomedical science
(e.g. clinical trials, cross-sectional studies in humans, experimental animal studies) with

open or available raw data as examples, but did not use systematic sampling in this
process. The studies are referred to in the text by their article reference, although the
specific meta-analyses analyzed were usually one of many included in the original
studies (Table 1). The first one, from Chen et al.18, describes the effects of eyemovement desensitization and reprocessing therapy on the symptoms of posttraumatic
stress disorder. Mathie et al.19 performed a meta-analysis on double-blind, placebocontrolled trials of homeopathic treatment. Kredlow et al.20 studied the post-retrieval
extinction effects on fear memories of rodent models. Finally, Munkholm et al.21
estimated levels of BDNF in bipolar disorder patients (irrespective of affective state).
We obtained the effect size, sample size and standard error for each study from
figures in the articles (Fig. 2 in Chen et al., 2014, Kredlow et al., 2016 and Mathie et al.
2017; Fig. 1S in Munkholm et al., 2016) except for Kredlow et al., 2016, in which standard
error data was obtained by contact with the first author. The data extracted from the
figures was fed into the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.3 (CMA, Biostat Inc.),
which converted the data, when necessary, to Hedges’ g estimates and computed
sampling variances. From the reference sections, we obtained the PubMed ID (or DOI,
when PubMed ID was not available) of the original studies included in the meta-analyses,
which we used to generate author networks for each of them. We used the R metafor
package to obtain estimates of between-study variance (I2 for quantification and Q-test
for hypothesis testing), as well as indicators of small-study effects suggestive of
publication bias (Egger’s regression and trim-an-fill-analysis, with funnel plots presented
in Supp. Fig. 1). The choice of trim-and-fill was made following the analyses used in the
original articles, but currently there are other recommended options, as selection model
approaches.

22,23

The original features of these meta-analyses can be found in Supp.

Table 1. Note that the effect sizes in the original studies may diverge from our
calculations due to the use of different estimators, as we chose to use a uniform
approach for all meta-analyses rather than following the original models.
Construction of author networks

We developed two methods for the construction of the graph networks describing
connections between authors (Fig. 2): (a) a MATLAB code, available as supplementary
material, that uses the PubMed ID or DOI of the original studies and accesses PubMed
to search for the authors of each study, connecting those with common publications
within the meta-analysis; and (b) manual search of articles in the Web of Science
database and data processing with VOSviewer software24. Both methods are described
in detail hereafter.
MATLAB code
Network creation using the MATLAB code uses a list of each result in the metaanalysis and either the respective PubMed ID or DOI of its study of origin as input. This
information is used to search PubMed for the author list of each article. A list of authors
and related study identifiers is then created by the code. If there is no match for a specific
search, the DOI number will be listed as an author by itself, which will ultimately become
a cluster with no connections. The code uses this output to generate a relationship
adjacency matrix of the searches, weighing every connection between authors by the
number of co-authored results within the meta-analysis. Both the list of authors and the
matrix are saved as CSV files. All routines are available as supplementary material with
running examples and brief instructions.
VOSviewer software
In order to increase the accessibility of our method, we also explored other
software resources for alternative ways to build authorship networks. For this, we
manually searched the Web of Science database using the PubMed ID (or DOI, when
PubMed ID was not available) of all articles in the meta-analysis (a search string example
for Munkholm et al. is provided as supplementary data). The retrieved results were saved
as a non-formatted text file for VOSviewer handling. In the software, we chose the option
of creating a map based on bibliographic data to generate a co-authorship network.
Software options were set to (a) full counting (so that each co-authorship would weigh
equally), (b) not ignoring documents with large number of authors, and (c) reducing first

names to initials. We did not use any minimum threshold for number of publications or
citations per author. The output was saved as a GML file.
An advantage of this method compared to the MATLAB code is that it allows the
use of other databases besides PubMed, such as Web of Science and Scopus.
Moreover, it may be more user-friendly to some researchers. Despite minor differences,
both methods achieved a similar number of clusters in our example search (Supp. Fig.
2). However, in VOSviewer there is no automatic handling of search errors (i.e.: not
finding a DOI number) and the methods to weigh connections between authors are
different (i.e.: edges are weighed by the number of shared articles in VOSviewer, while
our MATLAB code weighs them by shared results within the meta-analysis; these
methods may diverge when there are multiple results within articles), which can cause
some changes in clustering. Thus, we decided to use the MATLAB-generated networks
for further analyses.
Lifetime PubMed connections
When exploring ways to consider author networks, we also attempted to base
connections on the full range of PubMed publications of each authors, in order to identify
collaborations outside of the meta-analyses under study. For this purpose, we used a
code that, after downloading the full article list for each author name with initials as
retrieved from a DOI or PMID search from PubMed itself, crosschecked each pair of
authors within this article list, creating new connections or adding weight to existing ones
according to the matched names if collaborations were found within the PubMed
database (Supp. Fig. 3). However, after manually revising the retrieved articles for
establishing author identity, we found that this method created a prohibitive number of
spurious associations between researchers due to articles from homonyms (Supp.
Table 2). Using author’s full names as retrieved from articles instead of initials as search
seeds did not fully solve this problem. Thus, we chose to maintain the approach of using
connections within the meta-analysis for the subsequent steps in order to prevent
spurious clustering of unrelated authors. We note that, albeit infrequently, homonyms

can also be an issue within a meta-analysis. Thus, we recommend to manually check for
them among included studies before constructing co-authorship networks. Automated
methods for author disambiguation have also been described in the literature25, but for
individual meta-analyses manual screening is likely to be sufficient.
Modularity analysis
To define author clusters, we used Gephi 0.9.2 to perform modularity analysis of
author networks. We used the software’s default settings (i.e.: random decomposition;
using weights from edges; resolution = 1), which uses the Louvain method for community
detection26. After separation of authors into clusters, we manually assigned results from
studies to their respective clusters. If a study had authors from different clusters, its
results were assigned to the cluster with the most authors in the study. In the case of a
tie (something that did not happen in our examples), effect sizes can be attributed to both
groups, halving the sample size in each of them so as not to distort the meta-analytic
effect estimate; alternatively, they can also be attributed to a separate cluster. As
described previously, if a DOI did not retrieve any authors from PubMed, the results from
this study became a cluster by itself. In our sample of meta-analyses, it only occurred in
Mathie et al., where six studies included in the meta-analysis did not have any DOIs or
PMIDs. The obtained clusters were used to build the collaboration networks in Fig. 2 and
the histograms showing the distribution of results among articles and clusters in Fig. 3.
R² estimation for articles and clusters
Data extracted from meta-analyses (effect size, sample size and standard error)
was fed into Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.3 (CMA, Biostat Inc.), which
computed point estimates and variances for the studies. We then calculated the
proportion of the variance explained either by (a) articles or (b) author clusters using two
separate mixed-effects meta-regression models, using restricted-maximum likelihood
(REML) estimator, with either the article or cluster as a categorical moderator (Table 2).

τ2𝑅𝐸 − τ2𝑀𝐸
),
τ2𝑀𝐸

The computation of R2 follows the equation 𝑅2 = (

where τ2𝑅𝐸 is the total

amount of heterogeneity, as estimated based on a standard random-effects model, and
τ2𝑀𝐸 is the amount of residual heterogeneity, as estimated based on the mixed-effects
meta-regression model. Using this calculation, the sampling distribution of R² values is
dependent on the number and size of subgroups (i.e. the distribution of individual results
among articles or clusters): the fewer and smaller the subgroups, the greater the chance
of finding spurious high values of R² by chance alone, due to inaccurate estimation of
variance within them. As the grouping structure varied widely across meta-analyses, we
used a bootstrapping method for inferring the p-value. We constructed an R code to
perform a Monte Carlo permutation test, randomly reshuffling study results within each
meta-analysis 1000 times, while maintaining its structure in terms of number and size of
subgroups. We then estimated p-values for the R² values found in each meta-analysis
by calculating their correspondent percentile in the generated R² probability density
distributions (Supp. Fig. 4). The files for all meta-analyses in CMA and the R codes for
p-value calculations are available as supplementary material.
Detecting deviant author clusters
To detect research groups with results differing from the rest of the literature
(Figs. 4-7), we used the R package metafor27 to compare the estimates of each author
cluster with the meta-analytical estimate of the remaining studies. For each comparison,
we assumed that the cluster and the remaining studies each represented an independent
random-effects model and calculated the estimate and standard error for both, using the
REML estimator for τ². We then combined these two estimates in a fixed-effects model,
using these two estimates as a moderator and testing for its significance using a Waldtype test of the difference between the two estimates. This approach is similar to a
multiple random-effects meta-regression, as both have similar performance in terms of
Type I error rates and statistical power, and it is preferable when residual betweenstudies variances are clearly different28,29. We adjusted all p-values for the number of

tests conducted within each meta-analysis using a Bonferroni-equivalent p-value
correction. The R codes for these comparisons are also available as supplementary
material. Finally, it is important to notice a distinction from this method to the traditional
sensitivity analysis, in which a meta-analysis is compared with and without a given result.
Instead, our method compares the cluster itself with the meta-analysis without it.
Correction of estimates by multilevel analysis
After clustering results from the meta-analyses, the effect size estimates obtained
across studies are nested within two higher-level grouping variables (i.e. article and
research group), whose impact on heterogeneity can get tangled up when they are
analyzed separately. Moreover, unbalanced representations between different articles
or research groups can bias meta-analytic estimates towards the effects found by a
highly-represented research group, making them less representative of the literature as
a whole. To control for this, we used the metafor R package to employ the multilevel
meta-analytic model described by Konstantopoulos15. We calculated the overall estimate
and variance components for this multilevel model, adding random effects both at the
level of articles and author clusters (Supp. Table. 3). This analysis, as well as our
previous R2 calculation (Table 2), demonstrated that the article level had negligible
influence on three of the four meta-analyses; moreover, since these had few articles with
more than one results, the multi-level model runs the risk of being distorted by inaccurate
estimation of within-article variances. Thus, for our main multilevel analysis, we
considered only the author cluster level. We then compared these results with those
obtained with a standard random-effects model that did not consider the group of origin.
(Table 3). A forest plot showing article-level estimates for Kredlow et al. 2016 is shown
in Supp. Fig. 5. The codes for these analyses are provided as supplementary material.

Results
Meta-analysis features
We initially extracted data from the four meta-analyses to use as case studies.
Two of them18,19 were of clinical intervention studies, one concerned behavioral studies
in rodents20, and the other comprised biomarker studies in patients21. There was
significant heterogeneity in all four, as reflected by Q-tests and I² values (Table 1).
Egger’s regression indicated small-study effects suggestive of publication bias for two of
the meta-analyses, but only one had a high number of missing studies according to trimand-fill analysis, as shown by the funnel plots in Supp. Fig. 1.
Defining research groups by collaboration networks
To define research groups, we constructed graph networks using individual study
authors in each meta-analysis as nodes, with the weights of edges defined by the
number of studies coauthored within the meta-analysis. Modularity analysis separated
these authors into clusters representing research groups, represented in different colors
in Fig. 2.
Histogram distributions for the number of results per article and research group
(Fig. 3) show that the majority of clinical studies had a single result per article. On the
other hand, in the meta-analysis of rodent studies by Kredlow et al., a much higher
number of results per article is found. After aggregating results by author cluster in Chen
et al. and Mathie et al., we could identify only a few groups with more than one study,
and none with more than three. On the other hand, after applying the same procedure in
Kredlow et al. and Munkholm et al, we observed the appearance of author clusters
contributing up to 15 results.
Influence of article and author cluster of origin on effect sizes
To measure how much of the heterogeneity in each meta-analysis could be
attributed to the author cluster and/or to the article of origin, we calculated the amount of
the total between-results variance that could be explained by grouping the results
according to either cluster or article membership (Table 2). In meta-analyses where most

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19001305; this version posted December 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

articles contributed a single result, the article of origin explained none of the overall
heterogeneity. However, in Kredlow et al., the article of origin explained most of the
observed heterogeneity across experiments, an influence that was also captured at the
author cluster level. For Chen et al. and Mathie et al., there was no statistically significant
influence of authorship on the variance. In Munkholm et al., on the other hand, the
amount of heterogeneity explained by authorship was smaller, but statistically more
significant.
Detecting deviant author clusters
The approach described above allowed us to quantify the influence of authorship
on heterogeneity, but not to attribute this effect to specific author clusters. In order to do
that, we compared the effect estimates of each author cluster with that of the remaining
studies within the meta-analysis. When applying this method to Chen et al. (Fig. 4) and
Mathie et al. (Fig. 5), in which the authorship effect is small, just one cluster out of 16
(6.2%) in the former and 3 out of 40 (7.5%) in the latter were significantly different from
the rest of the results after controlling for multiple comparisons. Conversely, in Kredlow
et al. (Fig. 6), where the number of clusters was smaller and there was a high impact of
authorship on heterogeneity, 4 out of 6 clusters (66.7%) were significantly different from
a meta-analysis excluding their own results. In Munkholm et al. (Fig. 7), there was also
evidence of authorship bias, with 5 of 21 clusters (23.8%) differing significantly from the
rest of the meta-analysis.
Correcting effect estimates by multilevel analysis
After quantifying the amount of variance attributable to articles and author
clusters, we used random-effects multilevel models using either cluster (Chen et al.,
Munkholm et al., Mathie et al.) or both cluster and article (Kredlow et al.) as nested levels
to summarize the results. This allowed us to correct for the effects of non-independence
on effect size estimates, as well as to differentiate the effects of article and author cluster
membership when both were present. Table 3 shows the estimates obtained with these

models, comparing them to a standard random-effects model that does not take
authorship into account.
For meta-analyses with no significant authorship effect on heterogeneity (Chen
et al. and Mathie et al.), the multilevel model showed negligible influences of the clusterlevel component of heterogeneity, leading to effect estimates that were almost identical
to those of the standard two-level model. On the other hand, for Kredlow et al., in which
strong evidence of authorship bias was found, we observed a twofold change in the
estimate of the multilevel model when compared to the standard one. For this metaanalysis, multilevel modelling showed that variance was explained both by the cluster
and article levels, with a higher value for the cluster component (Supp. Table 3), as can
be observed in a forest plot with estimates grouped by article (Supp. Fig. 5). Lastly, for
Munkholm et al., the cluster component maintained its effect on heterogeneity, slightly
changing the multilevel model effect estimate and leading to a wider confidence interval
and a higher p-value than the standard model.

Discussion
Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been used for decades to synthesize
scientific data, shaping evidence-based policies, and guiding medical decisions31. For
these summaries to be reliable, however, meta-analyses should not simply summarize
the literature, but also help to identify biases and other pitfalls in order to correct for
them32. Many of these methods are used routinely nowadays, such as Egger’s
regression, funnel plots33, and trim-and-fill analysis34 to detect small study effects
suggesting publication bias, I² calculations to evaluate heterogeneity35, and excess
significance tests36 to detect preferential reporting of significant findings and/or phacking.
In this work, we describe a simple method to detect and correct for authorship
bias in meta-analyses. This phenomenon happens when results from the same
laboratory or research group are summarized without proper correction for non-

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19001305; this version posted December 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

independence, potentially giving excessive weight to results from a single group in
estimate calculations. This type of bias has mostly gone unattended in the available
literature, perhaps because most clinical meta-analyses are performed based on a small
number of studies, usually containing a single result each37.
Isolated evidence has suggested the presence of authorship bias in specific fields
of research. For instance, in a meta-analysis of violence risk assessment tools, it was
shown that tool designers found more positive results than independent investigators
evaluating other researchers’ tools38. A recent meta-regression study on randomized
trials on the safety of hydroxyethyl starch also identified that a specific research group,
with a history of retractions due to data manipulation, had significantly different effect
sizes when compared to other groups39. Nevertheless, these investigations have been
carried out on an individual basis, using different methodologies in each case. We
believe that having a standard method for automatically attributing authorship to different
groups can allow this kind of analysis to be performed more systematically in metaanalyses.
The problem of non-independence among results is much more marked in metaanalyses from preclinical studies, which have been on the rise in recent years40. These
types of studies often have smaller sample sizes and greater heterogeneity among them
than clinical studies; moreover, each article frequently contributes with several different
experiments to the same meta-analysis40,41. Thus, it is not uncommon for a single lab to
account for a large fraction of the research in a given area. Accordingly, in our example
of a preclinical meta-analysis20, we identified a strong influence of both the article and
research group of origin on effect sizes. We believe that this kind of non-independence
may be the rule for meta-analyses of non-human biomedical research; thus, tools that
can detect and account for this phenomenon can be especially useful in this field.
The main contribution of our method is to provide an objective, unbiased definition
of a research group. This definition is usually highly subjective, as group affiliation and
collaboration patterns are variable and dynamic. We have circumvented this issue by

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19001305; this version posted December 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

creating a collaboration network graph based on the meta-analysis itself and using
modularity algorithms to detect author communities within it. This method is based on
collaboration between researchers – thus, even scientists who are not currently in the
same research group or laboratory can be aggregated if they are highly collaborative.
We believe that this method can capture groups of researchers with similar views,
methodological preferences and interpretations, and thus provide an objective, datadriven approach to detect authorship bias. The fact that authorship influence was
detected in 2 out of 4 meta-analyses evaluated in our study shows that this form of
clustering captures real sources of heterogeneity, and provides initial validation of our
method as a useful tool for further analyses of the literature.
An arguably intuitive option for our method would be adding a moderator variable
that reflects the place where the study was conducted; however, we believe that there
are several limitations in this approach. First, an article with authors from different
institutions likely means that experiments took place in different locations. In this case,
one should make a choice on which is the main place for that investigation (e.g.: by the
affiliation of the corresponding author, or by the number of authors related to one
location), adding subjectivity to the analysis. Second, it is somewhat common that a
researcher develops a body of literature in one institution but later move places,
maintaining the same methods and analyses from the former laboratory. Third, there is
the case of multicenter clinical studies, where patients of diverse locations across the
globe provide samples for analysis in a single laboratory, which could even be different
from the research group that designed the study. Thus, the idea behind the cluster
analysis is precisely to provide an objective, data-driven approach to define authorship
communities. Moreover, although it is probable that the authorship cluster will
occasionally reflect the laboratory location, we believe that in most settings it would be
more useful than adding a location-based moderator, as the latter ignores the influence
of authors’ experimental and analytical handling.

Nevertheless, our method of creating graphs has limitations. As it was fully based
on co-authorship within the studies included in the meta-analysis, it is likely that many
collaborations will go undetected, as authors can work together in articles outside of this
sample. We attempted to avoid this issue and improve our detection of collaborations by
using PubMed searches of single authors in order to construct lifetime collaboration
graphs (Supp. Fig. 3). However, the sheer lack of specificity of names and initials –
which are still the seeds for most database searches in science – generated a prohibitive
amount of false-positive collaborations that distorted the resulting graphs (Supp. Table
2). As unique author identifiers such as ORCID42 become more popular, however, it is
likely that such approaches will be more feasible in the near future – and in that case,
lifetime collaborations might ultimately yield better authorship maps than individual metaanalyses.
A simple tool such as ours might plausibly be incorporated in meta-analysis
packages to provide a simple assessment of authorship bias. Although it currently runs
on partly on proprietary software (i.e. MATLAB), similar implementations can be obtained
using other platforms – a preliminary analysis shows that using VOSViewer, a tool for
constructing bibliometric networks24, leads to very similar results (Supp. Fig. 2). The
clustering algorithm itself is built with open-source software (Gephi) and based on wellknown mathematical algorithms for dealing with graph clustering26. Thus, although our
initial implementation and validation of the tool has been performed on different software
platforms, a plausible short-term development is to incorporate these different functions
within a unified package.
In this work, we have focused on the immediate advantages of detecting
authorship bias within an individual meta-analysis. After detecting and quantifying the
percentage of heterogeneity due to authorship, we showed that this effect could be
attributed to individual clusters in some meta-analyses. This resembles sensitivity
analysis, a procedure that is routinely performed in meta-analyses43, but is based on
groups rather than individual results, thus providing a way to detect research groups

yielding results that deviate from the remaining ones. The interpretation of these
discrepant results can vary, but an objective way to prevent the output of a single
research group from inappropriately distorting meta-analytical estimates is to perform
multilevel modeling based on author clusters. In our work, we show that this approach
can have a large effect on individual estimates, especially in situations with high
clustering of results, as in the case of preclinical research.
Although we have referred to the effect of authorship on effect sizes as
‘authorship bias’, it should be clear that such bias is not necessarily due to authors’
perceptions and beliefs. There are myriad sources of variability that can occur due to
methodological choices that, if consistent within a research group, can lead to bias
towards smaller or larger effects. Studies of inter-laboratory variability in basic science
have shown that, even when careful measures are taken to ensure methodological
homogeneity, a large amount of the variance among experiments is attributable to the
laboratory where they are performed44,45. The same is true for clinical populations, which
are likely to be more similar within the work of a single research group than across
groups. Meta-regression of specific methodological variables within studies can help to
assess whether these variables can account for the effect of authorship; nevertheless,
even if no such moderators are found, one cannot rule out the possibility that unassessed
methodological factors can be responsible for variability in results among research
groups.
Finally, although our work was focused on the application of authorship clusters
to provide insights on the meta-analyses themselves (e.g. effect estimate correction and
detection of deviant groups), a tool for evaluating authorship bias can also have more
widespread applications in understanding how authorship influences results in different
fields of science. Although our limited sample does not allow us to generalize our
conclusions, it is interesting to note that the impact of authorship on effect sizes was very
different between meta-analyses of clinical and preclinical data. Whether these and other
patterns of authorship bias hold true in larger, representative samples of meta-analyses

from different fields of research is an open question that tools such as ours can help to
tackle, providing wider insights on the interactions between authorship and study results.

Highlights
What is already known:


Meta-analyses are prone to various types of bias that can influence effect size
estimations;



One of the source of bias in meta-analyses is non-independence between study
results from the same research group;

What is new:


We develop a method to automatically define research groups, by creating a
collaboration network graph based on studies in a meta-analysis and using
modularity algorithms to detect author communities;



We demonstrate that the research group of origin can impact effect size in distinct
types of meta-analyses;



We show that multilevel random-effects meta-analytic models can be used to
correct this type of bias.

Potential impact for RSM readers outside the authors’ field


The described method can be applied to any kind of meta-analysis to estimate
authorship bias, regardless of research field;

Supplementary Table 2. Analysis of differences between networks built using different
methods. For each method, we plot the number of (a) lost edges, (b) spurious edges, (c)
edges with reduced weight due to lost papers, and (d) edges with increased weights due to
spurious collaborations when each of the 3 automated methods shown on Supp. Fig. 3 is
compared to a manually verified ‘gold standard’ network of lifetime collaborations. Lifetime
DOI-based search for articles in PubMed using last names and initials added a significant
number of new connections, leading to the spurious aggregation of clusters that were
separated in the verified network. Full-name search on PubMed was able to reduce this effect,
but still led to the formation of many spurious edges. As expected, within-meta-analysis
searches did not detect many of the edges formed by lifetime collaboration graphs; on the
other hand, it did not lead to the formation of any spurious connections.

Supplementary Table 3. Multilevel random-effects model analyses including article as a level.
We applied a multilevel model considering both the author cluster and article as levels (with article
nested within author cluster) for all meta-analyses. The table shows the effect estimate, 95%
confidence interval and p-value for both models, the separate within-level variance components (σ2)
for author cluster, article and individual results in the multilevel analysis.

Figure 1. Study flow diagram. After study selection, we used modularity algorithms from graph
networks to define author clusters within each meta-analysis. We then adopted different approaches
to measure authorship bias: i. Evaluating the influence of author cluster in meta-analysis
heterogeneity by R2 estimation through mixed-effects meta-regression; ii. Detecting clusters with
results diverging from the remaining studies by a Wald-type test between estimates from randomeffects models of the cluster and of the aggregate of the remaining ones; iii. Using multilevel analysis
to correct meta-analytic estimates. Software tools used are shown for each individual step. CMA

Supplementary Figure 2. Author network generation using different software methods (A)
Author network in the Munkholm et al., 2016 meta-analysis (Fig. 1S in the original paper) built using
MATLAB code: Network has 202 nodes, 1010 edges, 21 clusters; (B) Same network built using
VOSviewer: Network has 194 nodes, 964 edges, 21 clusters. Although the first method identified
more nodes (and consequently more edges), the overall network structure was similar, with the same
number of author clusters. Equivalent clusters are similarly colored, although cluster positions are
randomly assigned.

Supplementary Figure 3. Comparison between distinct methods for identifying collaborations.
We built networks using four different approaches to detect co-authorships between authors within
all three meta-analyses included in Kredlow et al., 2016: (A) Within-meta-analysis connections, where
authors are connected only by articles included in the meta-analysis itself. Notice that this network is
different from that shown in Figure 2, which refers to a specific meta-analysis within the study.
Network contains 87 nodes, 248 edges and 14 clusters; (B) Lifetime DOI search, where we used DOI
numbers to retrieve researchers’ abbreviated names from PubMed, which were then used to search
lifetime publications for each author. Based on these lists, we identified connections between authors
by automated name crosschecking. Network contains 87 nodes, 293 edges and 9 clusters. (C)
Lifetime full name search, where we manually retrieved authors’ full names (i.e.: non-abbreviated first
names) from studies included in the meta-analyses and used these as search seeds to retrieve
lifetime publications in PubMed and identify collaborations, in an attempt to minimize spurious hits
caused by homonyms. Network contains 87 nodes, 284 edges, 11 clusters. (D) Lifetime verified
connections, where we searched each pair of researchers using abbreviated names in PubMed, and
then manually verified each article in the output to exclude spurious connections. Network contains
87 nodes, 272 edges, 11 clusters. For all graphs, cluster colors and positions are randomly generated
– thus, clusters of the same color in different graphs do not necessarily correspond to one another.

Supplementary Figure 4. R² probability density distributions. For each meta-analysis, we
randomly shuffled results among subgroups, while maintaining the subgroup structure for each metaanalysis in terms of subgroup number and size. For each reshuffling, we calculated R2 using a mixedeffects meta-regression model. Histograms show the random R² probability distributions when
grouping by article or authorship cluster using the structure of each meta-analysis, which were used
to estimate the p-value for the actual R2 values displayed in Table 2. For Chen et al. R2 calculation
for article grouping was not necessary, as each article contributed a single result.

Supplementary Figure 5. Outcome effect sizes from Kredlow et al. grouped by article. As the
meta-analysis from Kredlow et al. was the only one to indicate influence of article-level grouping on
heterogeneity, individual outcome effect sizes were grouped for visualization of trends within studies.
The plot shows the effect size (in Hedges’ g) and error (95% CI) of individual outcomes (squares),
andthe estimates of meta-analyses for each article (diamonds). Each subgroup was compared
against the remaining studies within the meta-analysis by a Wald-type test, yielding Bonferronicorrected p-values shown on the right column. Estimates and corrected p-values of clusters
significantly differing from the rest of the meta-analysis at an α of 0.05 are shown in red.
