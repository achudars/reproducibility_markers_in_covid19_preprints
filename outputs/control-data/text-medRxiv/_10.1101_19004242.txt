Causal mediation analysis of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in children with obesity and
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
Abstract:
Background: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a common co-morbidity of obesity.
Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), also associated with obesity, may contribute to the
dysmetabolic state that predisposes to NAFLD.
Objective: To assess the relationship between SH and NAFLD in children with biopsy-proven
NAFLD compared to controls.
Design and Methods: In this retrospective study of children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and
age-matched controls, the association of SH with NAFLD was assessed followed by causal
mediation analyses under the counter-factual framework.
Results: Sixty-six cases and 4067 age-matched controls were included in the study. Children
with NAFLD were more likely to be male (74.6 vs 39.4%, p < 0.001), have higher modified BMIz scores (2.3 ±1.6 vs 1±1.6, p < 0.001), and abnormal metabolic parameters (TSH, ALT, HDL-C,
non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex and severity of
obesity showed significant association between the 4th quartile of TSH and NAFLD. Causal
mediation analysis demonstrates that TSH mediates 44% of the effect of modified BMI-z score
on NAFLD. This comprises of 16.2% (OR = 1.1, p < 0.001) caused by the indirect effect of TSH
and its interaction with modified BMI-z, and 26.5% (OR = 1.1, p = 0.01) as an autonomous
effect of TSH on NAFLD regardless of the obesity.
Conclusions: The association of SH and biopsy-proven NAFLD is demonstrated in children
from predominantly Latino population. Further, a causal mediation analysis implicates an effect
of TSH on NAFLD, independent of obesity.

Introduction:
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology
without a secondary cause of hepatic fat accumulation1, has become the most common chronic
liver disease in children in parallel with the rising prevalence of obesity 2. NAFLD is considered
the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome which includes high blood pressure,
dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and truncal obesity3. The spectrum of NAFLD includes simple
steatosis through steatohepatitis. Simple steatosis may have a benign course, but
steatohepatitis can lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma4. The gold standard for the
diagnosis and staging of steatohepatitis is liver biopsy.
Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined as mildly elevated thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH 4.5-10 mIU/L) with normal levels of circulating thyroid hormone and commonly
occurs with obesity in both pediatric and adult populations. Thyroid hormone is an important
regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism through induction of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis,
coupling of autophagy to mitochondrial fat oxidation thereby leading to ketogenesis, and
causing reverse cholesterol transport5. Therefore, it is not surprising that a close relationship
has been seen between SH and cardiometabolic risk factors and NAFLD in adults6-8. A small
number of studies in Caucasian children, primarily from Europe, have shown the association
between SH and NAFLD in children and adolescents with obesity9-12. Using hepatic ultrasound
for the diagnosis of NAFLD, these studies demonstrated higher levels of TSH in individuals with
hepatic steatosis9-12.
The prevalence of NAFLD is higher in older males, especially those of Hispanic
ethnicity13,14. However, little is known about the association of NAFLD and SH in this population.
The goal of this study was to identify the relationship between SH and NAFLD in a cohort of
children of predominantly Latino ancestry with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Further, given the role of

thyroid hormones in lipid metabolism and NAFLD, we hypothesized that SH may be a causal
mediator for the development of NAFLD in children with obesity.
Materials and Methods
In this retrospective study, the cases were identified from a registry of children with biopsyproven NAFLD from the Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology program at Columbia
University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) between 2010-2018. The evaluation of the patients
referred to the program includes investigation for infectious, autoimmune and heavy metal
exposure as a cause of NAFLD in addition to the assessment of thyroid function. We selected
the cases where etiology other than obesity was ruled out and data were available on thyroid
function tests. All children underwent liver biopsy for persistently elevated serum
aminotransferase level despite lifestyle interventions1,4 to confirm the diagnosis as well as to
assess inflammation, fibrosis and the degree of hepatic fat deposition.
The control subjects were age-matched children attending the primary care clinics at the
same institution with available TSH and free T4/total T4 levels, ALT ≤ 45 IU/L, AST ≤ 40 IU/L,
bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl and alkaline phosphatase ≤150 IU/L, and absence of any acute or chronic
liver disease seen in the same time period, 2010-2018. Retrospective lifetime data was
collected from the electronic health records (EHRs) including prior physical examinations,
anthropometric parameters measured during routine clinical care, laboratory tests, imaging
studies and diagnoses codes. All subjects with ICD-codes consistent with renal disease,
diabetes, known thyroid or other endocrine disease were excluded. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kg/(height in m)2. BMI-z scores and modified BMI-z (mod-BMI-z) were
calculated as per the CDC guidelines15,16. BMI class was considered normal BMI between 5-85th
percentile for age, moderate obesity as BMI between the 85th percentile-120% of 95th percentile,
and severe obesity as BMI > 120% of 95th percentile for age17. The population served by
CUIMC is primarily children residing in the Washington Heights area of New York City with the
racial/ethnic background of 71% Hispanic, 7% non-Hispanic Black, 17% non-Hispanic Whites,

3% Asian and 1% others according to the U.S. Census Bureau Population estimates, 2013,
which is also the expected distribution of the population in this study. As the validity of individual
level data for race and ethnicity could not be assured, this data was not included in the
analyses.
Liver Biopsy:
Liver biopsy was performed in patients with evidence of hepatic steatosis on imaging with
excluded secondary causes of liver disease and persistently elevated aminotransferases
despite lifestyle interventions as per the standard of care guidelines1,4. Needle biopsy was
performed in a pediatric procedure unit with anesthesia. Biopsy specimen was sent to the
Columbia University pathology department for histological analysis of liver inflammation, fibrosis
and fat deposition based on hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as trichrome staining when
applicable. As per pathology guidelines, NAFLD was defined as macrovesicular steatosis in
greater than 5% of hepatocytes18.
Laboratory measurements:
Results of laboratory tests were ascertained from the EHRs. Serum concentrations of total
cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were
measured using routine enzymatic methods with Roche/Hitachi Cobas® c system analyzer
(USA). Value of low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using Friedwald equation.
Standard liver function tests, including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were
measured on the same day with an auto analyzer. Non-HDL cholesterol was calculated as TC
minus HDL-C. Serum samples were assayed for fT4, total T4 and TSH levels using an
automated chemiluminescence assay system on Roche e601 platform. Peak values for TSH,
ALT, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and non-HDL cholesterol were extracted from individuals’ lab test
results. Subjects were excluded if they have TSH value greater than 10 mIU/L or positive
antithyroid antibodies and/or received thyroid related medications.

A descriptive analysis of the cohort was performed by calculating absolute and relative
proportions for categorical variables, and the mean and standard deviation for continuous
variables. Distribution of continuous variables were examined for skewness and kurtosis and
were logarithmically transformed, when appropriate. Geometric means and SD are reported
where the variables were not normally distributed. To assess differences between the subjects
with and without NAFLD, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied for continuous variables and
the chi-squared test for categorical variables. TSH values were categorized into four equal
groups (quartiles) for the univariate and multivariate analysis. Univariate analysis was
performed to assess the association between TSH quartiles and NAFLD. Multivariate logistic
regression was used to determine the association between TSH quartiles and NAFLD adjusted
for age, gender and class of obesity. Similar methods were also used for association between
the individual lipid levels and TSH. For sensitivity analyses, the above analyses were also
performed with TSH as a binary variable using a level > 4.5 mIU/L as abnormal.
To explore causal mediation of SH in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, mediation analysis
using the counterfactual framework was performed between mod-BMI-z (continuous) with TSH
as the mediator and presence of NAFLD (binary outcome) using logit link along with exposure
mediator interaction 19,20. Mod-BMI-z was used as this has been shown to be a better measure
of adiposity than BMI-z in children with severe obesity15. Age and gender were used as
covariates in the causal mediation models. The mediation effect was decomposed into 4components: i) direct effect : the effect of exposure, mod-BMI-z, on NAFLD in the absence of
the mediator, TSH, ii) interactive effect : the effect of the mediator, TSH, on the outcome,
NAFLD in the absence of the exposure, mod-BMI-z, iii) a mediated interaction: the interaction of
exposure, mod-BMI-z and the mediator, TSH, and iv) pure mediated effect: mediation of TSH
between the exposure and the outcome21. TSH and non-HDL-C levels were log-transformed
and centered for these analyses. The analyses were performed in SAS v3.7 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) and R-statistical software v3.2 using libraries aov, dplyr, DescTools and

ggplot2. A two tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Medical Center as an
expedited exempt protocol due to the retrospective nature of the study.
Results:
From the registry of 78 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD, a total of 66 subjects with available
thyroid studies were included as cases. There were no differences in the age, gender, BMI or
lipoprotein profile of the excluded cases. Of the total 21,258 unique age-matched children seen
at the primary care clinic in the same time period, 4300 subjects had data available on thyroid
function tests and lipoproteins variables used in the study. One hundred eighty-three subjects
were eliminated for elevated liver enzymes, and 50 for biologically implausible anthropometric
values or chronic disease based on ICD-codes including thyroid disease. The final study cohort
comprised of 66 cases with biopsy proven NAFLD and 4067 age matched controls. The
demographic details of the cohort are provided in Table 1. Briefly, there were a higher number
of males in the NAFLD group, the BMI z-score, mod-BMI-z and the proportion of individuals with
severe obesity was higher in the NAFLD group compared to the controls. All the metabolic
parameters assessed in the study (TSH, ALT, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C and TG) were
significantly higher in the cases with NAFLD, and free T4 levels were similar (Table 1). The high
ALT levels of the cases are in keeping with the expectation of presence of Non-Alcoholic
Steato-Hepatitis (NASH) in the cases22.
The TSH levels were divided into 4 quartiles: TSH Q1 < 1.06, TSH Q2 1.06-1.59, TSH
Q3 1.59-2.35, TSH Q4 > 2.35 mU/L (Table 2). In the univariate analyses there were higher odds
of the presence of NAFLD in the 3rd and 4th quartile of TSH compared to TSH Q1. Controlling for
age, gender, and class of obesity, this association reached statistical significance in the 4th
quartile. ALT, non-HDL-C, and triglycerides showed a similar pattern but not LDL-C, HDL-C and
TC (Table 2). While the total number of children across the 4 quartiles are similar (Table 2), the
proportion of cases in the higher TSH quartiles is more compared to the controls (Fig. 1).

Sensitivity analyses with a TSH level of > 4.5 mIU/L considered as abnormal controlling for
age, gender and BMI class showed a statistically significant association with NAFLD (OR = 3.7
[95% CI 1.6,7.5], p < 0.001) that persisted while controlling for non-HDL-C (OR = 3.5 [95% CI
1.5,7.2], p = 0.002). A similar association was not noted between abnormal TSH category and
LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC or TG.
The causal mediation analysis showed 57.3% (OR = 1.3 [95% CI 1.1,1.5], p = 0.001)
direct effect of mod-BMI-z on the presence of NAFLD. The mediated effect of TSH on NAFLD
was 16.17% (OR = 1.05 [95% CI 1.0-1.1], p < 0.001) comprising of 9.4% of pure mediation and
6.8% of mod-BMI-z and TSH interaction. Interestingly, 26.5% (OR = 1.13 [95% CI 1.0-1.3], p =
0.01) of the effect was the reference interaction caused by TSH on NAFLD, without the
influence of mod-BMI-z (Table 3). The total interaction effect of TSH, both from its interaction
with mod-BMI-z and the independent effect, was 33.3% (p = 0.002). Of the total effect of modBMI-z on NAFLD, 44% can be eliminated by intervention on the mediator, TSH.
Discussion:
This study shows the association of SH and NAFLD in children of predominantly Latino ancestry
with biopsy-proven diagnosis of NAFLD. To our knowledge, this is the first study in children to
examine this relationship in cases with the gold-standard for diagnosis of NAFLD and explore
the causal mediation of TSH for NAFLD. The causal mediation analysis demonstrates a partial
mediation role of TSH in the relationship between the mod-BMI-z score and the presence of
NAFLD. Additionally, the 4-way decomposition of the causal mediation model shows an effect of
TSH on NAFLD independent of mod-BMI-z. Taken together these 2 effects provide statistical
evidence for the mechanistic role of SH in the association between mod-BMI-z and NAFLD.
SH is a common occurrence in adults with a tendency towards development of overt
hypothyroidism23. In adults, SH has been variably associated with adverse cardiometabolic
effects, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diastolic dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction,
coronary heart disease and heart failure6,24,25. On the other hand, SH among children has been

considered a benign and remitting condition, with the risk for progression only seen in
individuals with certain underlying causes, such as autoimmune disease26. The evidence on the
effect of SH on the growth and neurocognitive outcomes is conflicting27,28, but the evidence on
the proatherogenic and metabolic abnormalities is increasingly being recognized29-33.
In this study, the children with NAFLD had a higher degree of obesity (BMI-z, mod-BMI-z
and proportion of children with severe obesity) with higher levels of non-HDL-C and TG. This is
similar to the published reports. In a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 528 euthyroid
children, Aypak et al found an association of higher levels of TSH and fT3 levels with obesity, as
well as an association of increased level of dyslipidemia and higher systolic blood pressure with
higher levels of TSH29. In a cohort of 49 prepubertal children with SH for a minimum of 2 years
and age matched controls, Cerbone et al showed higher cardiometabolic risk factors, measured
in the form of waist to height ratio, atherogenic index (ratio of TC: HDL-C), TG: HDL-C ratio,
homocysteine levels, and lower HDL-C levels30. These findings were replicated in a cohort of
adolescents ascertained from the community-based Korea National Health and Nutrition
Examination surveys 33. Similar observations are made in a cohort of 22,147 children with Type
1 diabetes collected from multiple centers across Germany with or without the presence of
autoantibodies32. Pacifico et al extended the observations of the association of metabolic
findings with SH to NAFLD. Their study of 49 children with NAFLD and matched controls
showed that in addition to the association with hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance, SH
(TSH > 4.5 mIU/L) was also associated with NAFLD, while adjusting for age, gender, BMI and
free T3/T4 levels11. In a separate study, higher insulin resistance, carotid intimal thickness and
left ventricular mass was shown in children and adolescents with SH and NAFLD compared to
matched obese and lean controls34.
As many of the human studies on SH have been performed in children with obesity,
there is some debate about the directionality28. The inflammatory state in obesity is thought to
influence the sodium-iodine symporter causing hyperthyrotropemia that may resolve with weight

loss 35. It is not known whether hyperthyrotropinemia, dyslipidemia and NAFLD are driven by
similar (or serial) mechanisms and in what direction. The mediation analysis performed in this
study attempts to address this question. Given the known biology of the influence of thyroid
hormone on lipid metabolism5, we hypothesized that TSH is a mediator of the effect of obesity
on NAFLD. The causal mediation analysis under the counterfactual framework showed that the
association between obesity and NAFLD is partially mediated by TSH. The more interesting
finding from this analysis was the identification of the effect of TSH on NAFLD independent of
the mod-BMI-z. This raises the question of whether children with SH in absence of obesity are
also at a higher cardiometabolic risk. While studies of children with long-term untreated
autoimmune and idiopathic SH do not show higher overall adiposity, they may suffer from higher
visceral adiposity36. Indeed, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio were higher among
children with mild SH than among healthy euthyroid children matched for age, gender, height
and pubertal status36,37.
Thyroid hormones have direct effects on both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and
metabolism in a cell autonomous manner by transcriptional regulation of target genes involved
in several of the hepatic metabolism pathways. Animal studies have shown that mildly
hypothyroid mice develop NAFLD by impaired suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis as well as
upregulation of de novo lipogenesis due to breakdown in the complex metabolic pathways in the
liver38. Aside from this, TSH has been independently found to modulate lipid metabolism
through the TSH receptors on the hepatocytes to induce hepatosteatosis via sterol regulatory
element binding protein, SREBP39. TSH also suppresses the synthesis of hepatic bile acid via
an SREBP2-hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNFα)- CYP7A1 signaling pathway40. Moreover,
TSH inhibits cholesterol synthesis by increasing AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of
hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) to inhibit HMGCR activity41. Collectively, these
findings support the role of TSH itself in regulation of both hepatic lipid and cholesterol
homeostasis.

The strengths of this study are the availability of the large cohort of children with NAFLD
proven by liver biospy, and the matched control group that allowed the causal mediation
analysis in a population of children of predominantly Latino ancestry. The limitations are the
retrospective nature of the cohort, and data extraction from EHRs that precludes confirmation by
repeating the tests or performing additional ones. We were unable to include measures such as
race/ethnicity, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, waist circumference or pubertal status in this
analysis because either the data were incomplete, or the accuracy of ascertainment could not
be assured. Further, while we used the thyroid function tests obtained prior to the established
diagnosis of NAFLD, it is possible that undetected NAFLD was already present at the time, in
which case, the relationship is an association rather than mediation. Regardless, the results
make an important contribution to the growing body of evidence on the complex relationship
between thyroid hormone, lipid metabolism and its role in long-term cardiometabolic
consequences of obesity, raising the question whether there is a role of treating SH, either by
weight loss or medications, to improve the long-term health outcomes. The results of this study
can be considered as the preliminary data to spark further conversation and longitudinal studies
to understand these mechanisms in humans towards more effective clinical management
strategies in future.
