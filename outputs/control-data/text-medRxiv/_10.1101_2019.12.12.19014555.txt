Introduction

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable (~70%), common and

1

impairing neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex genetic architecture . Recent case-

control genome-wide studies point to the involvement of thousands of relatively common

2

single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) , very rare protein-truncating sequence variants

3

and likely pathogenic missense mutations , as

(CNVs)

well as

large, rare

copy number variants

4–6

. Although all of these classes of variant are associated with ADHD risk, identifying

specific risk alleles is an important next step. Studies of

offspring

trios

provide

an

especially

powerful

approach

de novo
to

mutations using parent-

gene

discovery

because

the

background rate in unaffected individuals is low, and therefore if an elevated rate in cases is

demonstrable, such mutations are likely pathogenic and can provide important insights into

7

disease biology .

De novo

likely-damaging mutations, that include CNVs which intersect genes, have been

identified for other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD),

Tourette disorder, developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID), and schizophrenia

12

. Individuals with ASD have a rate of

than

in

unaffected

siblings

or

disorder have a similar rate of

de novo

control

7–

CNVs that is between 3- and 5-fold higher

individuals

13

.

Individuals

with

simplex

Tourette

de novo CNVs to probands with ASD14 as do individuals with

7

schizophrenia . Of these neurodevelopmental disorders, the rate of

in individuals with DD/ID, at approximately 10%

de novo CNVs is highest

15

.

Trio-based genetic studies of ADHD are lacking. There has been only one small study and it

reported a rate of

de novo CNVs

(1.7% or 3 probands out of N=173) that was only slightly

elevated above previous reports of

de novo rates in controls16. In this study, we set out to

CNVs in parent-offspring trios of probands diagnosed clinically

with ADHD.

Method

Sample
Children with ADHD, aged 5 to 17 years old, were recruited from UK child and adolescent

mental health and paediatric clinics. ADHD diagnoses based on DSM-IV or DSM-III-R were

confirmed via a semi-structured research diagnostic interview (the Child and Adolescent

Psychiatric Assessment

using the WISC-IV

17

) by trained, supervised psychologists. Full-scale IQ was assessed

18

. A proportion of the probands in the sample (N=136 or 44.6%) have

been analysed in previous case-control CNV studies

4,5

. Approval for the study was obtained

from the North West England and Wales Multicentre Research Ethics Committees. Written

informed consent to participate was obtained from parents and children aged 16 years and

older and assent was gained from children under 16 years of age.

Genotyping, CNV calling and quality control (QC)
DNA was obtained from blood and Oragene (saliva) samples for ADHD probands and both

biological

parents.

were

sex check were retained. Only complete trios that passed QC and an additional Mendel

check in PLINK (to confirm biological relatedness) were used for CNV calling.

WF>0.05. Additionally, we applied further, more stringent criteria in ADHD probands and

excluded individuals with extreme scores on QC metrics (>4SD than the sample mean) as

follows: if they had an apparently excessive CNV load (NSEG>50.8 or KB>16593) or poor

(BAF-SD>0.063).

These

additional

steps

were

performed

to

ensure

that

de novo CNVs would be of high quality, while being conservative and not removing

potential

a whole trio based on reduced data quality in just one parent. N=305 complete trios passed

all of the above QC and were kept for analyses. After these steps, only CNVs of size >200kb

were retained for analysis, to ensure accuracy of calls.

CNVs were then annotated as ‘transmitted’, ‘non-transmitted’, or ‘likely

de novo’ based on

presence or absence of a call made in either parent and/or proband. All CNVs that were

genome build hg19. Overlap was defined as a CNV overlapping at least 50% of a previously

implicated region or a CNV affecting the coding sequence of a gene in the list of genes of

interest.

CNVs (N=9 that were >500kb and N=5 that were between

Two of the

de novo CNV carriers were female and the rest were male. The overall mutation

rate was 4.6% (14/305) and the per individual rate was 4.3% (13/305). Although we did not

have population controls available in this study, a recent study of control trios using similar

methodology reported a

de novo mutation rate of 1.0% for CNVs>200kb24; thus the rate in

ADHD was over four times higher than this comparable control rate. The mean IQ of

CNV carriers

, as summarised in Table 2. In addition,

previously in case-control CNV studies of ADHD

duplications at 16p13.11

25

and a

de novo duplication at 15q13.126 have also previously been

observed in people with schizophrenia. Given that a proportion of the current sample have

previously been included in published case-control CNV studies

of the

de novo

4,5

, we determined that eight

loci in our study overlap at least partially (≥50% overlap) with a previously

reported CNV in a person with ADHD, with six of these eight

de novo

CNV carriers having

taken part in the previous case-control studies. On the other hand, six of the loci in our

study

(4p16.3,

10q11.22-q11.23,

10q21.3,

10q22.2,

15q26.3,

and

16p13.3)

are

in

novel

regions and have not been previously reported in individuals diagnosed with ADHD in these

large case-control studies.

Discussion

In this study, we present observations on

de novo

CNVs from the largest published trio-

based study of ADHD to date. The overall mutation rate for

de novo CNV carriers was 4.6%,

which is a similar rate to that observed for two other DSM-5 childhood neurodevelopmental

disorders:

ASD

and

Tourette

disorder

13,14

,

and

somewhat

higher

than

observed

for

7

schizophrenia . Notably, the rate we observed is substantially higher than that which has

been

reported

for controls

24

and

observed an overall rate of 1.7%

the

previous

and

only

trio-based study

of

ADHD that

16

. Aside from the lower power of this previous, smaller

16

study, one potential explanation for the difference is that, unlike Lionel and colleagues

, we

did not exclude those with an IQ<70. However, in the current study, only three of the 13

individuals who were carrying

de novo

CNVs had an estimated IQ<70, with one further

individual who had missing IQ data.
