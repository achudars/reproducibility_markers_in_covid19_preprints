Abstract

22

Influenza epidemics cause substantial morbidity and mortality every year worldwide.

23

Currently, two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and type B viruses co-circulate

24

in humans and infection with one type/subtype could provide cross-protection against the

25

others. However, it remains unclear how such ecologic competition via cross-immunity and

26

antigenic mutations that allow immune escape impact influenza epidemic dynamics at the

27

population level. Here we develop a comprehensive model-inference system and apply it to

28

study the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the three influenza types/subtypes

29

in Hong Kong, a city of global public health significance for influenza epidemic and

30

pandemic control. Utilizing long-term influenza surveillance data since 1998, we are able to

31

estimate the strength of cross-immunity between each virus-pairs, the timing and

32

frequency of punctuated changes in population immunity in response to antigenic

33

mutations in influenza viruses, and key epidemiological parameters over the last 20 years

34

including the 2009 pandemic. We find evidence of cross-immunity in all types/subtypes,

35

with strongest cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2). Our results also suggest

36

that A(H3N2) may undergo antigenic mutations in both summers and winters and thus

37

monitoring the virus in both seasons may be important for vaccine development. Overall,

38

our study reveals intricate epidemiological interactions and underscores the importance of

39

simultaneous monitoring of population immunity, incidence rates, and viral genetic and

40

antigenic changes.

Introduction

45

Influenza epidemics recur annually in many regions of the world and cause significant

46

morbidity and mortality, leading to 3 to 5 million severe infections and 291,000 to 646,000

47

deaths worldwide each year (1, 2). These recurrent epidemics are a combined outcome of

48

viral antigenic changes, interactions among co-circulating influenza viruses, transmission

49

and host immune response. Influenza viruses undergo continual genetic mutations and

50

punctuated antigenic changes, which allow them to escape prior immunity and cause new

51

epidemics (3-6). In addition, currently two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1) and A(H3N2),

52

and influenza B co-circulate in humans; and infection of a certain type/subtype can result

53

in partial immunity to influenza strains of the same type/subtype as well as strains across

54

subtypes (7-15) and types (16-18). The latter cross-reactive immunity—termed cross-

55

immunity—leads to epidemiological interactions among influenza viruses that, along with

56

viral antigenic changes, shape influenza phylodynamics and epidemic dynamics (19-31).

57

Improving understanding of interactions among influenza viruses and the resulting impact

58

on epidemic dynamics will thus provide insights to aid public health efforts to mitigate the

59

burden of influenza.

60
61

As observed epidemic dynamics are the result of the aforementioned key

62

evolutionary and epidemiological processes, in this study, we utilized a long-term influenza

63

incidence surveillance dataset collected in Hong Kong since 1998 to estimate the timing of

64

punctuated antigenic changes, strength of cross-immunity, duration of immunity, as well as

65

other key epidemiological parameters for each of the three types/subtypes. Hong Kong is a

66

subtropical city located in Southeast Asia. Unlike the highly seasonal epidemics in

67

temperate regions, in the subtropics and tropics, influenza epidemics can occur at any time

68

of the year (32, 33) and, often, multiple types/subtypes co-circulate causing co-epidemics

69

of comparable magnitude. The long-term Hong Kong dataset with diverse epidemics thus

70

provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay of different influenza types/subtypes

71

at the population level.

72
73

These highly diverse epidemic dynamics, however, also present major challenges

74

for inference on transmission dynamics. In an exploratory analysis, we coupled a

75

commonly used multi-strain susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model (24)

76

with a particle filter (34-36), a Bayesian inference method, and applied it to the Hong Kong

77

dataset. While this model-inference system was able to reproduce the observed epidemic

78

pattern, the model state did not appear to converge (see Fig. S1). Three major challenges

79

exist. First, the seasonality of influenza in part shapes the epidemic dynamics and thus

80

should be accounted for in the model. However, unlike the winter-time epidemics in

81

temperate regions that have been well-characterized by seasonal forcing of climate

82

variables (humidity alone or with temperature) (37, 38), to date no models capable of

83

capturing the diverse seasonal pattern in tropical and subtropical climates exist. Second, to

84

estimate epidemiological parameters such as the duration of immunity, the inference

85

system must be able to preserve such long-term epidemic features. Single-pass filters (e.g.,

86

the particle filter) did not appear to do so as seen in our exploratory analysis. Multi-pass

87

filters (e.g., iterated filters (39-41)) have such built-in capability, however, are less adept in

88

modeling diverse epidemic dynamics (42). Finally, it is challenging to estimate a large

89

number of parameters needed to characterize the interactions between virus-pairs.

90
91

We therefore developed a model-inference system that addresses the above

92

challenges. The basic reproductive number R0 is a key epidemiological parameter

93

describing the transmissibility of an infection, defined as the average number of secondary

94

infections that arise from a primary infection in a naïve population. We thus first estimate,

95

for each influenza type/subtype, the average R0 in each week of the year based on the

96

average annual epidemic cycle, i.e. the empirical seasonal cycle. We then incorporate this

97

R0 seasonal cycle (as the prior distribution) in the model-inference system to control for

98

the seasonality observed in Hong Kong. For the second challenge, we combine the IF2

99

iterated filtering algorithm (41) with space re-probing (36, 43), a technique that allows

100

continuous exploring of state space. The combined SR-IF2 inference method coupled with

101

the empirical seasonal multi-strain SIRS model is thus able to preserve the long-term

102

epidemic feature while adeptly explore the state space to capture the epidemic dynamics.

103

To estimate parameters in high dimensional state space, we take a multi-round inference

104

strategy; in the first round, we parse the entire state space into subspaces and test each to

105

find the optimal subspace; subsequent rounds then build on the previous one until the

106

model estimates converge. Indeed, testing using model-generated mock epidemics

107

indicates that this model-inference system and optimization strategy is able to recover the

108

true model state variables and parameters (SI Appendix and Figs S2 and S3).

109
110

Here we apply the validated model-inference system to the Hong Kong dataset and

111

infer how major antigenic evolutions and cross-immunity affect influenza transmission

112

dynamics therein over the last 20 years. Our results reveal intricate ecological interactions

Results

117

Overall influenza epidemic characteristics and seasonal cycles in Hong Kong. During

118

Jan 1998—July 2018 (~20 years), there were 17 A(H1N1), 21 A(H3N2), and 18 B

119

epidemics, respectively (or 13, 19 and 14, respectively, if only counting larger epidemics;

120

see SI Appendix and Figs. S4 and S5 for divisions of individual epidemics). Figure 1 shows

121

the superimposed annual cycle for each influenza type/subtype in Hong Kong during the

122

study period and the average cycle excluding 2009 for the A(H1N1) pandemic in that year.

123

All three types/subtypes were able to circulate any time in the year. Epidemics of A(H1N1)

124

and A(H3N2) occurred in both winter and summer with similar magnitudes (Fig 1 A and

125

B). In comparison, for influenza B, major epidemics tended to occur in winter months (Fig

126

1C). As a result, the estimated R0 seasonal cycle has clear bimodal peaks for the two A

127

subtypes (Fig 1 D and E), although to a less extent for A(H1N1); and for type B, it has only

128

one peak in the winter.

Model-fits to influenza epidemic dynamics in Hong Kong (1998–2018). Figure 2 shows

131

the model-fits to the epidemic curves of the three influenza types/subtypes. Despite the

132

highly irregular epidemic timing and intensity, the model-inference system, run

133

continuously through the entire 20-year study period, was able to recreate the observed

134

epidemic dynamics for all three types/subtypes. Distributions of residuals were centered at

135

0, indicating no systematic biases of the model (Fig S6). In addition, the model-inference

136

system was able to accurately estimate the infection rates during both epidemic and non-

137

epidemic periods for all types/subtypes. In particular, over the 20-year study period,

138

epidemics of A(H1N1) were less frequent compared to the other two types/subtypes. For

139

instance, few A(H1N1) cases were reported during Jan 1998 – Dec 1999 (the entire 2-year

140

period) and May 2002 – Dec 2004 (the entire 2.5-year period). While R0 followed the same

141

seasonal cycle as years with epidemics (Fig 3A), the estimated infection rates remained at

142

near-zero over these extended time-periods when A(H1N1) was not in circulation (Fig 2A).

143
144

In addition to running the model continuously without re-initiation to correct for

145

model errors, we included a continuous seeding at a constant rate of 1 case per 100,000

146

population per 10 days for all types/subtypes. This epidemic seeding represents travel-

147

related importation of cases into local population, since Hong Kong is a transportation hub

148

highly connected to places worldwide. This seeding is also designed to test the accuracy of

149

estimates of key model state variables and parameters, as they are intricately linked to the

150

infection rate. Foremost, overestimation of population susceptibility would lead to

151

overestimation of cases during non-epidemic periods, as the seeded cases would lead to an

152

epidemic should the effective reproductive number Re (computed as R0 times population

153

susceptibility) be above unity and sustain so. Conversely, underestimation of susceptibility

154

would lead to underestimation of cases during epidemic periods or require unrealistically

155

frequent antigenic changes prior to an epidemic. Further, population susceptibility is also

156

linked to the duration of immunity and the strength of cross-immunity. Loss of immunity

157

(determined by the immunity period) replenishes the susceptible pool whereas gaining of

158

cross-immunity from infection by other types/subtypes (determined by the strength of

159

cross-immunity) can reduce susceptibility. As such, estimates of these related parameters

160

should also be accurate in order to achieve accurate estimation of infection rate. Taken

161

together, the accurate infection rate estimates suggest that the model-inference system was

162

also able to accurately estimate key state variable variables and parameters.

163
164

Population susceptibility, R0, infectious period, and immunity period. Table 1

165

summarizes the estimates of key epidemiological parameters for each influenza (sub)type.

166

Weekly estimates are shown in Fig 2 (susceptibility), Fig 3 (R0 and Re), and Fig S7

167

(infectious period, immunity period, and cross-immunity). During Jan 1998 – July 2018,

168

estimated population susceptibility was higher for A(H1N1) and B than A(H3N2) (Fig 2).

169

The mean levels and ranges were 66.6% (range: 50.9–90.3%) for A(H1N1), 60.8% (46.4–

170

89.0%) for A(H3N2), and 68.6% (50.6–87.8%) for B, respectively. These estimates were

171

consistent with the relative infection rates of individual types/subtypes. Note, however,

172

due to stringent public health interventions (i.e., case isolation, contact tracing, and school

173

closure) implemented from early May to mid-July 2009 (44) and self-protection (e.g.,

174

improved personal hygiene and social distancing) during that time (45), the pandemic in

175

Hong Kong unfolded relatively slowly and estimated population susceptibility at the

176

beginning of the 2009 pandemic was relatively low (~71% in mid-July; Fig 2).

177
178

The basic reproductive number R0 was in general higher for A(H3N2) (1.6; range:

179

1.3–2.0) than A(H1N1) (1.4; 1.1–1.8) and B (1.4; 1.1–1.8). Estimated R0 for the A(H1N1)

180

pandemic in mid-July 2009 was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3, 1.8), similar to previous estimates (46).

181

182

average to unity over the 20-year study period for all types/subtypes. The estimated

183

infectious period was slightly longer for A(H3N2) (3.0; 2.6–4.3 days) and B (3.1; 2.2–4.1

184

days) than A(H1N1) (2.6; 2.2–3.8 days).

185
186

The length of immunity period determines the duration of immune protection from

187

prior infection and is thus a key epidemiological parameter shaping the long-term

188

dynamics of influenza epidemics. However, it remains difficult to estimate due to the

189

complex nature of immunogenicity and lack of detail, longitudinal serological data (47, 48).

190

Given the uncertainty, we tested a wide prior range from 1 to 9 years. The posterior

191

estimate of immunity period (Table 1 and Fig S7) was about 3 years for both A(H1N1) (3.1;

192

2.6–4.0 years) and B (3.1; 2.7–3.5 years), and shorter for A(H3N2) (2.2; 1.8–2.6 years).

193

These estimates accounted for cross-immunity from infections of other types/subtypes, for

194

which, after conversion based on the strength of cross-immunity, was treated the same as

195

specific-immunity from the same type/subtype (see Eqn 1 in Methods).

196
197

Key ecological interactions via cross-immunity. The strength of cross-immunity may

198

modulate the ecological completion among co-circulating influenza viruses. Here we

199

estimated the pair-wise cross-immunity strength, relative to specific-immunity from the

200

same type/subtype (Table 1 and Fig S7; cij denotes cross-immunity against virus-i gained

201

from infection of virus-j). Three interesting features seem to characterize the interactions

202

between the three influenza types/subtypes. First, interactions are asymmetric (i.e., cij ≠ cji)

203

and cross-immunity appears to be weaker from types/subtypes with higher mutation

204

rates. In particular, among all virus-pairs, cross-immunity was the weakest when gained

205

from infection of A(H3N2) (the mean was 17% of the strength of specific-immunity against

206

A(H1N1) and 11% against B). Second, as expected, homotypic- is stronger than heterotypic

207

cross-immunity. Among all virus-pairs, cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2)

208

was the strongest (40%; 23–56%). Third, cross-immunity appears to mediate ecologic

209

competition among the three influenza types/subtypes, with B "controlling" A(H1N1) and

210

the latter further "controlling" A(H3N2). Specifically, the second strongest cross-immunity

211

was from B against A(H1N1) (32%; 26–40%); this, along with the strong cross-immunity

212

from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2), formed a control cascade of B → A(H1N1) → A(H3N2). The

213

higher mutation rate of A(H3N2) virus (4) then allowed it to escape prior immunity

214

including cross-reactive ones from A(H1N1) and B. On the other hand, cross-immunity

215

from A(H1N1) against B (23%; 19–32%) was comparable to the reverse, allowing the two

216

viruses to maintain a more balanced bidirectional ecologic competition.

217
218

As our estimates that cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2) is stronger

219

than the reverse appeared to contradict previous notion that A(H3N2) outcompetes

220

A(H1N1) (see, e.g., (49)), we further used model-simulation to test the long-term impact of

221

cross-immunity under three different scenarios: 1) As estimated here, i.e., setting all cross-

222

immunity terms to the posterior mean estimates; 2) A(H3N2) outcompeting A(H1N1) via

223

stronger cross-immunity, for which we set cH1←H3 to 0.5 (vs. 0.4 for cH3←H1); and 3) No

224

interactions, i.e., setting all cross-immunity terms to 0 (see details in SI Appendix and

225

simulated epidemics in Figs. S8-10). As shown in Fig. S11, scenario 1 most closely

226

reproduced the observed pattern of co-circulation. In contrast, scenario 2 (i.e., A(H3N2)

227

outcompeting A(H1N1)) largely underestimated the frequency of A(H1N1) epidemics,

228

whereas scenario 3 (i.e., no cross-immunity) largely overestimated the frequency of co-

229

epidemics caused by multiple types/subtypes.

230
231

Timing and frequency of punctuated antigenic changes. Analyses of the antigenic

232

evolution of influenza have shown that major antigenic changes occur in a punctuated

233

fashion, allowing substantial increases in population susceptibility and in turn surge of

234

influenza epidemic (4, 26, 50). To capture such punctuated antigenic changes, our model-

235

inference system allowed abrupt increases in population susceptibility in response to

236

unexpected epidemic surges that are potentially due to major antigenic evolutions in the

237

influenza virus. We then used the major increases in population susceptibility (i.e., >15%

238

increase relative to the preceding week; results using 10% as cutoff are consistent; see

239

Table S1) to identify potential punctuated antigenic changes. Over the 20-year study

240

period, we detected such major changes in population susceptibility 7 times for A(H1N1),

241

including two due to the 2009 pandemic (Fig 2A), 12 times for A(H3N2) (Fig 2B), and 4

242

times for B (Fig 2C). Table 2 shows the estimated timing of each potential antigenic

243

innovation. Based on these estimates, punctuated antigenic changes occurred every 4.6

244

(SD=4.6; exponential distribution) years in A(H1N1) (excluding the 2009 pandemic), 1.8

245

(SD=1.2; gamma distribution) years in A(H3N2), and 6.2 (SD=6.2; exponential distribution)

246

years in B during Jan 1998 – July 2018. These results are consistent with reported

247

estimates based on antigenic testing of influenza virus isolates (4, 50). Further,

248

interestingly, for A(H3N2), such potential antigenic innovations occurred with comparable

249

frequencies in both summers (7 times in May, June or July) and winters (5 times in Jan or

A(H1N1) and only in winters for B.

Discussion

254

Cross-immunity among different influenza viruses has been reported and its resulting

255

potential interactions have been modeled; however, to date, its strength and impact on

256

influenza transmission dynamics at the population level remains unclear. Utilizing a long-

257

term incidence surveillance dataset in Hong Kong since 1998, here we have quantified the

258

strength of cross-immunity among the two influenza A subtypes and B currently co-

259

circulating in humans and the pattern of viral interactions. We have also estimated the

260

timing and frequency of punctuated surges in population susceptibility representing

261

population-level response to antigenic innovations in influenza viruses over the last 20

262

years as well as identified key variations among three influenza types/subtypes. These

263

estimates, along with other key epidemiological variable estimates including the

264

population susceptibility and basic reproductive number, provide great insight into the

265

evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of influenza.

266
267

Comparing transmissibility of influenza in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Influenza

268

epidemics in subtropical Hong Kong are highly diverse and frequent (Fig1 and Figs. S4 and

269

S5). Nevertheless, R0 estimates across all three types/subtypes are in the range of 1.1 to

270

2.0, similar to previous estimates in other regions for influenza overall (51). Few studies

271

have estimated R0 for individual influenza types/subtypes, especially for inter-pandemic

272

seasons. Here we estimate that R0 was similar for A(H1N1) and B (range: 1.1–1.8 for both)

and was slightly higher for A(H3N2) (range: 1.3–2.0). Estimated simultaneously with R0,

274

the infectious period, or generation time, was slightly longer for A(H3N2) and B than

A(H1N1); these estimates were very close to those based on viral shedding curves—3.0 vs

276

3.1 days reported for A(H3N2), 3.1 vs 3.4 days reported for B, and 2.6 vs 2.3 days reported

277

for A(H1N1) (52). Together, the higher transmissibility of A(H3N2) (i.e., larger R0 and

278

longer infectious period) in part explains its larger seasonal epidemics and resulting lower

279

average population susceptibility (mean: 60.8% for A(H3N2) vs. 66.6% for A(H1N1) and

280

68.6% for B). Further, these consistent estimates indicate that our strategy using the

281

empirical R0 seasonal cycle in the model-inference system is effective in controlling for the

282

elusive influenza seasonality in Hong Kong and allows for estimation of other key

283

epidemiological features. Future studies could apply the same strategy to study the diverse

284

influenza dynamics in other subtropical/tropical regions or other infections with similar

285

challenges.

286
287

Cross-immunity and co-circulation pattern. Multiple lines of evidence have suggested

288

cross protection offered by infection of influenza viruses of the same type/subtype as well

289

as across types/subtypes (7-18). However, some studies have reported weak or no

290

heterosubtypic and/or heterotypic cross-immunity (47, 53). As noted by authors of those

291

studies, the cross-sectional serological surveys used therein may miss the window of cross-

292

immunity and/or immunity mechanisms not related to antibodies against the

293

hemagglutinin surface protein (e.g., from T cells mediated immunity). In this study, based

294

on the long-term type/subtype-specific incidence data, we estimate that there were

295

relatively strong cross-immunity against A(H3N2) by infection of A(H1N1) (~40% of the

296

specific-immunity) and moderate level of cross-immunity between A(H1N1) and B (20-

297

30%). Consistently, our simulations showed that interactions among the three

298

types/subtypes are needed to produce the pattern of co-circulation observed in Hong Kong

299

(Fig. S11 and Fig. S8 vs. Fig. S10).

300
301

However, our estimates of weak cross-immunities to A(H1N1) and B conferred by

302

infection of A(H3N2) appear to contradict the common notion that A(H3N2) outcompetes

303

A(H1N1) and B and, as a result, causes more frequent and larger epidemics. For instance,

304

Goldstein et al. (49) showed a negative correlation between early A(H3N2) incidence and

305

subsequent non-A(H3N2) incidence in the same season, suggesting A(H3N2) may interfere

306

with the other two types/subtypes. To test this discrepancy, we simulated epidemics under

307

both scenarios and showed that combining the frequent and large epidemics of A(H3N2)

308

with stronger cross-immunity conferred would likely drive A(H1N1) to extinction (see Fig.

309

S9; note epidemics of A(H1N1) were only possible after the imposed antigenic

310

innovations). Conversely, the strong cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2), as

311

estimated in this study, is consistent with the predominant circulation of A(H1N1) during

312

the 2009 pandemic despite the frequent circulation of A(H3N2) during inter-pandemic

313

seasons.

314
315

Thus, to understand the co-circulation pattern of influenza viruses, we need to take

316

into account other key epidemiological features. In particular, A(H3N2) confers shorter

317

immunity following infection and also undergoes more frequent genetic/antigenic

318

mutations. Based on the estimated mean immunity period and implicit assumption of

319

exponential distribution in the model (Eqn 1), the mean half-life of immunity (i.e. ln2 times

320

of the mean) was 1.6 years for A(H3N2), 2.2 years for A(H1N1), and 2.1 years for B. Note

321

our estimates were shorter than reported elsewhere (e.g., 3.5 to 7 years in (47, 48)), likely

322

because, unlike those studies based on titers of antibodies against specific strains, our

323

estimates broadly applied to the entire type/subtype. Nevertheless, the relative lengths of

324

immunity period for the three influenza types/subtypes were consistent. A recent cohort-

325

specific analysis (54) further showed that birth-cohorts whose first exposure was A(H1N1)

326

had long-term protection against subsequent infection by the same subtype whereas those

327

first exposed to A(H3N2) did not (See Table 4 in ref (54)). It is thus likely that A(H3N2)

328

virus' shorter/weaker immunity and more frequent mutations lead to more frequent

329

A(H3N2) epidemics, and that combining its larger epidemic size and weaker cross-

330

immunity (roughly, the product of these two factors is the decrease in susceptibility to its

331

complement types/subtypes) allows the two less frequently circulating influenza

332

types/subtypes to coexist in humans.

333
334

Estimating timing and frequency of antigenic innovations based on incidence data.

335

Unlike previous analyses of genomic and/or antigenic data, here we tentatively estimate

336

the timing and frequency of punctuated antigenic innovations based on incidence data

337

alone. The rationale is that punctuated antigenic innovations in influenza viruses would

338

lead to surge in population susceptibility and subsequently surge in incidence. That is,

339

incidence data encapsulate the population response to antigenic innovations and thus may

340

complement analyses of genomic and/or antigenic data (note the latter do not provide

341

information as to if an antigenic mutation would lead to an epidemic). Indeed, our results

342

are consistent with estimates from phylogenetic analyses. For instance, the two surges in

343

susceptibility to A(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic (i.e., around 9/13/09 and 1/5/10;

344

Table 2) roughly matched with the estimated timings of amino acid mutations from

345

NextStrain (55): 1) HA1: S185T and HA2: S124N around 10/1/09 (CI: 7/26/09-1/16/10)

346

and 2) HA1: D97N round 10/30/09 (CI: 09/03/09-02/07/10). In addition, previous

347

studies estimated that punctuated antigenic innovations occur roughly every 2 to 8 years in

348

A(H3N2) (26, 50), 4 to 9 years in A(H1N1), and 3 to 14 years in B (4), based on antigenic

349

analysis of influenza virus isolates. Consistently, we estimate that antigenic innovations

350

occurred very 4.6±4.6 years in A(H1N1), every 1.8±1.2 years in A(H3N2), and every 6.2±6.2

351

years in B during Jan 1998–July 2018. These consistent results suggest incidence

352

surveillance data could be an inexpensive alternative to support detection of evolutionary

353

changes in influenza viruses, especially since these estimates reflect changes in population

354

immunity in response to antigenic innovations and thus the potential of epidemic surge.

355
356

In addition, we note the different seasonal timing of antigenic innovations for

357

A(H3N2). While the identified antigenic innovations predominantly occurred in winters for

358

A(H1N1) and B, we find that A(H3N2) could undergo major antigenic changes in both

359

summers and winters. Further investigation is warranted, as, if confirmed, this seasonality

360

suggests that sampling A(H3N2) strains in the summer may be essential for selection of

361

vaccine strains.

362
363
364

Our study has several limitations. First, as B lineage data were only available since
2014 in Hong Kong, in this study, we did not differentiate the two B lineages (i.e. Yamagata

16

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19008987; this version posted October 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

365

and Victoria). Future work will extend the model-inference system to include and test the

366

epidemiological interactions with the two B lineages. Second, while using the empirical

367

seasonal cycle to account for the epidemic seasonality in Hong Kong has proven critical in

368

this study and may be applied to other subtropical and tropical regions with similar diverse

369

epidemics, better delineation of influenza seasonality in these climates is needed. Third,

370

we assumed that the probability of seeking medical attention for influenza is comparable to

371

other illnesses and, for simplicity, we did not consider the differences in health seeking

372

behavior among patients infected by different influenza (sub)types. Based on this

373

assumption, the estimated annual attack rates ranged from 13% in 2013 to 42% in 2005.

374

There is large uncertainty in estimated influenza attack rates. Recent estimates ranged

375

from 3-11% symptomatic infections among vaccinated and unvaccinated US residents

376

during 2010-2016 (56)to 32% confirmed infection among unvaccinated individuals during

377

2015 in New Zealand (57). In comparison, our estimates for Hong Kong are relatively high

378

but plausible given the longer epidemic duration and lower vaccination rates in Hong Kong

379

(~10% (58, 59) v. ~45% in the US (60)). It could also be due to overestimation of A(H3N2)

380

incidence rates, as patients infected with A(H3N2) may be more likely to seek treatment

381

due to more severe symptoms compared to A(H1N1) and B. Further, while we calibrated

382

the incidence rates of A(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic to the estimated attack rate from

383

serological data (see Methods), our model-inference system did not include public health

384

interventions implemented particularly at the beginning of the pandemic. As a result, our

385

model-inference system—entirely based on incidence data—likely underestimated the

386

increase in susceptibility at the onset of the pandemic. Nevertheless, the estimated timing

387

of antigenic innovations (6 July 2019) was very close to the observed onset of the pandemic

388

in Hong Kong (30 June 2019 (61)). Finally, due to a lack of age-specific incidence data and

389

for simplicity, we did not include age structure in our model. Recent studies have reported

390

differences in immune imprinting in children compared to adults (47, 48). Future work

391

may investigate such age differences further should age-specific incidence data become

392

available.

393
394

In summary, using a comprehensive model-inference system, we have revealed in

395

great detail the epidemiological interactions among the three influenza types/subtypes, the

396

antigenic innovations for each type/subtype, and their combined impact on the

397

transmission dynamics of influenza over the last two decades in Hong Kong, a city of global

398

public health significance for influenza epidemic and pandemic control. The intricate

399

epidemiological interactions among influenza viruses and key underlying population

400

features underscore the importance of monitoring population immunity to different

401

influenza viruses, incidence rates, and viral genetic and antigenic changes. Meanwhile, the

402

model-inference system developed here has proven powerful for estimating key

403

evolutionary and epidemiological characteristics of influenza viruses based on

404

type/subtype-specific incidence data and could be extended to study influenza epidemic

405

dynamics in other regions with limited antigenic data.

412

(62-64). In addition, the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch thereof conducts

413

laboratory testing for influenza viruses in samples submitted mainly from local hospitals

414

and also a small number of samples submitted by the sentinel outpatient physicians. We

415

obtained weekly records of ILI consultation rate and concurrent (sub)type-specific

416

influenza detection rate from the week ending 04 Jan 1998 to the week ending 14 July

417

2018. To obtain a more specific measure of the incidence of influenza virus infections in the

418

community, we multiplied the weekly ILI rate by the concurrent viral isolation rate for

419

A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B, respectively (42, 49, 65, 66). We refer to these combined

420

measures as A(H1N1)+, A(H3N2)+, and B+.

422

Converting ILI consultation rate to infection rate

423

The ILI consultation rate is the ratio of patients presenting ILI to all patient-visits and does

424

not measure true influenza incidence rate in the catchment population. Previously, we

425

showed that conversion to per-capita infection rate can be made based on Bayes' rule (65,

426

67). Briefly, ILI+ (here, ILI+ = A(H1N1)+, A(H3N2)+, or B+) estimates the probability that a

427

person seeking medical attention, m, has influenza, i.e., p(i|m). By Bayes’ rule, the incidence

428

rate, or probability of a person contracting influenza during a given week, p(i), is:

is known.

In our previous work, we estimated the conversion factor γ along with other model state

432

variables and parameters using a model-inference system without strain-interactions (36).

433

Here to reduce model uncertainty and complexity, we estimated γ separately based on

434

independent estimates of attack rate during the pandemic. Based on serological data,

435

estimated attack rates for the 2009 pandemic ranged from 16% (68) to ~20% (61, 69).

436

Using the upper end of these estimates and the cumulative pandemic H1N1+ rate over the

437

same time period (i.e., 42%), the conversion factor γ is ~0.5 for the pandemic. For the inter-

438

pandemic period, we set γ=1, which resulted in annual attack rates ranging from 13% in

439

2013 and 42% in 2005. The attack rate in 2005 was the highest due to epidemics of all

440

three types/subtypes in the same year (3.3%, 31.1%, and 7.4% attack rates for A(H1N1),

441

A(H3N2), and B, respectively). These estimates are higher than temperate regions but

442

plausible given the year-round circulation of influenza and low vaccination rates in Hong

443

Kong.

444
445

Estimating the empirical seasonal cycle of influenza epidemic. As discussed in the

446

Introduction, the seasonality of influenza epidemics in Hong Kong is weaker than in

447

temperate locations. To model this seasonality, we first computed the weekly average of

448

incidence rate over the study period, excluding year 2009 during which seasonality may be

449

altered due to the A(H1N1) pandemic. We then estimated the time-varying R0 for each

450

week of the year using a model-inference system we previously developed for Hong Kong

451

(36). This system used a basic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model and ran it

452

with a particle filter with space re-probing. We further smoothed the posterior estimates

453

of R0 using 3-week moving average and used these estimates as the prior in the multi-strain

454

SIRS model-inference system (described below) to represent the empirical seasonal cycle.

456

Multi-strain SIRS model. A number of mathematical models have been developed (19-29,

457

70-73) to study the interplay of influenza viruses. The central idea behind these models is

458

that cross-immunity can either reduce the chance of reinfection and transmission in any

459

individual with prior infection by a similar strain (i.e. leaky immunity) or protect a portion

460

of individuals with prior infection (i.e. polarized immunity). In particular, Gog and Grenfell

461

(24) developed a parsimonious status based multi-strain model by assuming polarized

462

immunity and cross-immunity acted to reduce transmission risk. This model is able to

463

generate evolutionary dynamics similar to that observed for influenza and is commonly

464

used as the backbone for more complex phylodynamic models (26, 28, 73, 74). The multi-

465

measures the strength of cross-immunity to virus-i conferred by infection of virus-j (e.g.,

population size is stable over the study period such that the birth rate and death rate are

equal and both are represented by parameter μ. The parameter α represents travel-related

477

variables/parameters were updated weekly at the arrival of observations.

478
479

Inference on transmission dynamics using the SR-IF2 algorithm. We applied a

480

modified IF2 algorithm (termed SR-IF2) to estimate the model state variables and

481

parameters for each week in the 20-year study period. The original IF2 algorithm,

482

developed by and described in detail in Ionides et al (41, 75), implements an iterated,

483

perturbed Bayes map for inference of partially observed dynamic systems. In each

484

iteration, it uses a particle filter (34) to estimate the likelihood of the observed time series

485

(here the A(H1N1)+, A(H3N2)+, and B+ time series altogether). The particle filter uses a

486

suite of model replicates, each is initially randomly drawn from the prior, to represent

487

samples of the latent dynamic variables. Over the course of filtering, the particles are

488

numerically integrated forward in time per the dynamic model (here the multi-strain

489

model in Eqn 1) and resampled based on the likelihood to update the distribution of all

490

model parameters/variables per Bayes' rule at each time step (here each week). At the end

491

of the time series, model parameters are recycled as starting parameters for the next

492

iteration. In theory, this procedure converges to the maximum likelihood estimate.

493
494

While the original IF2 incorporates perturbations of model parameters, our

495

preliminary tests showed that these perturbations alone are insufficient to capture the

496

unexpected surges in population susceptibility due to potential punctuated antigenic

497

changes in the influenza virus. To tackle this issue, we further incorporated space re-

498

probing (SR) in the IF2. Briefly, the SR step allows a small fraction (here 1%) of the model

499

ensemble to sample from the full prior range for key model variables/parameters (here,

500

the susceptibility), whenever filter divergence is detected (i.e., the likelihood drops below a

501

threshold); in addition, to capture other possible changes in parameters related to the virus

502

(e.g., R0 and strength cross-immunity), we set time points requiring SR as break-points, for

503

which larger perturbations are applied to all model parameters/variables (75).

504
505

The priors for initiating the SR-IF2 were uniform distributions as follows:

506

Si~U[50%, 90%] of total population and Di~U[2, 4] days for i=A(H1N1), A(H3N2), or B. To

507

account for seasonality of each (sub)type, the prior of R0 for week t of the year was drawn

508

from a uniform distribution with a range of the mean empirical estimate for that week

509

plus/minus one standard deviation. Correspondingly, the prior of transmission rate βi for

510

week t of the year was then computed as R0,i(t)/Di(t). For the immunity period Li, given the

511

wide range reported in the literature (from months to ~8 years (76, 77)), we tested prior

512

ranges from 1 to 9 years, divided into four 2-year segments (i.e., [1, 3], [3, 5], [5, 7], and [7,

513

9] years) for each type/subtype; this resulted in 43=64 combinations for the three

514

type/subtypes. Cross-immunity has been observed for influenza strains of the same

515

subtype as well as across types/subtypes (7-15) and types (16-18); however, the strength

516

has rarely been reported. We thus tested prior ranges from 0% to 80% of the strength of

517

specific immunity, divided into two levels: [0%, 40%] (low) and [40%, 80%] (high); this

518

resulted in 26=64 combinations for 6 virus-pairs (cij, i=H1N1, H3N2, or B and j

520

522

however, with perturbations in the IF2 procedure, the posterior estimates can go outside

523

the prior range. Together, we tested a total of 736 combinations of Li and cij priors in the

524

first round of search. We then selected the top ~1% runs with the best model-fits (highest

525

likelihood and fewest space re-probing needed) used their posterior estimates to compute

526

the prior range for subsequent round of search. We repeated this process until the

527

parameters converge. It took two rounds for the synthetic data and three rounds for the

528

observed data.

529
530

For each SR-IF2 model-inference run, we performed 50 iterations of filtering with

531

532

cluster (https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/information-for/information-

534

initiation, we performed 5 runs for each prior in the first round and 50 runs in the second

Estimating the timing and frequency of punctuated antigenic change. To identify

potential punctuated antigenic changes for each (sub)type, we computed the changes in

susceptibility for each week and considered weeks with a relative increase of 15% due to

542

punctuated antigenic changes. We also tested a cutoff of 10%, for which the identified

545

the study period and thus likely due to greater uncertainty in the model-inference system.

546
547

To estimate the mean time interval between punctuated antigenic changes, we

548

computed the time intervals between subsequent antigenic changes (right censored for the

549

last observation) and fitted these to four survival models (i.e., the exponential, Weibull,

550

gamma, and log-normal distribution) using the 'flexsurv' package (80) in R

551

(https://www.r-project.org). We selected the best model estimate based on the Akaike

552

Information Criterion (AIC).

Table 1. Estimates of key parameters. Posterior estimates from all runs and weeks are
pooled to obtain the mean and full range (in parentheses).
Table 2. Estimated timing and frequency of potential punctuated antigenic changes. Dates
(mm/dd/yy) of potential punctuated antigenic changes are identified based on above 15%
increases in susceptibility; the standard deviations are computed based on estimates from
all model-inference runs indicating punctuated antigenic changes around the same time.
The time intervals between subsequent antigenic changes are estimated based on four
different distributions; the best-fit estimates are shown in bold. For A(H1N1), numbers in
the parentheses show results when dates during the pandemic are included.

Table 2. Estimated timing and frequency of potential punctuated antigenic changes. Dates
(mm/dd/yy) of potential punctuated antigenic changes are identified based on above 15%
increases in susceptibility; the standard deviations are computed based on estimates from
all model-inference runs indicating punctuated antigenic changes around the same time.
The time intervals between subsequent antigenic changes are estimated based on four
different distributions; the best-fit estimates are shown in bold. For A(H1N1), numbers in
the parentheses show results when dates during the pandemic are included.

SI Appendix
Dynamic interactions of influenza viruses in Hong Kong during 1998-2018
Wan Yang, Eric H. Y. Lau, Benjamin J. Cowling
This supplemental document includes 1) Validation of the model-inference system using
model-generated mock epidemics; 2) Simulations to test the impact of cross-immunity on
long-term epidemic pattern; and supplemental table and figures.
1. Validation of the model-inference system
1.1 Method
We first tested our multi-strain SIRS model-SR-IF2 inference system using modelgenerated mock epidemics (i.e. synthetic data). Specifically, we tested its ability to
estimate three main epidemic features of interest: 1) The population susceptibility for each
virus over time, including timing of major susceptibility increase due to epochal antigenic
change. For the latter, we tested three levels of magnitude—small, medium, and large
change—with 10%, 15%, and 25% increase in susceptibility, respectively. 2) The strength
of cross-immunity between each virus-pair. For this, we tested two combinations of
heterosubtypic immunity (i.e., low H3N2→H1N1 and high H1N1→H3N2 cross-immunity for
the first synthetic dataset; high H3N2→H1N1 and median H1N1→H3N2 cross-immunity for
the second). and 3) The duration of immunity. Reported immunity period for influenza
varied substantially, ranging from months to ~8 years (1-4). Thus, we tested prior ranges
from 1 to 9 years.
To generate the mock epidemics for the above testing, we first generated 100,000
random combinations of initial conditions and model parameters except R0, using Latin
Hypercube sampling. Weekly R0 values were randomly sampled from a normal distribution
with the mean set to the empirical estimate for that week (Fig 1 in the main text) and
standard deviation set to 5% of the mean. To mimic punctuated antigenic changes, for each
(sub)type, we first identified the observed major epidemic peak weeks (peak ILI+ in the
upper ~75%, 60%, and 75% percentiles for the three (sub)types, respectively); for each
selected peak week, we increased the susceptibility at the 8th preceding week (i.e., roughly
the onset) by 15% for A(H1N1) (except for the pandemic) and A(H3N2), by 10% for B, and
by 25% for the A(H1N1) pandemic (see the selected weeks in Figs S2 and S3). We then ran
the multi-strain SIRS model (Eqn 1 in the main text) for each setting and selected 2
simulations that most closely resembled the observed epidemics in Hong Kong but had
different levels of cross-immunity between the two A subtypes: the first simulated time
series had high cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2) but low cross-immunity in
the reverse direction; and the second had moderate cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against
A(H3N2) and high cross-immunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1). We then added Poisson

random noise to the two simulated time series to mimic observational errors and used
these as mock data (termed synthetic 'truth') to test the model-inference system.
For each of the two synthetic truths, we performed two rounds of model-inference
using the same procedure and prior distributions for the Hong Kong dataset as described in
the main text. To evaluate the accuracy of the final posterior estimates, we computed the
root-mean-square-error and correlation with the 'truth'.
1.2 Results
Figures S2 and S3 show the posterior estimates of key model state variables (population
susceptibility for the three types/subtypes) and parameters (the basic reproductive
number R0, infectious period, immunity period and strength of cross-immunity) for the two
tests, respectively, compared with the true values. The relative root-mean-square-error
was 0.16 and the correlation was 0.83 combining all model variables/parameters from
both tests. These results suggest that our model-inference system and parameter
estimation strategy is able to accurately estimate the model state variables and parameters.
However, due to large fluctuations of R0 in the synthetic datasets (e.g., Fig S2B) and the
collinearity between R0 and susceptibility, the filter tended to compensate sudden
increases in infections (due to increases in susceptibility to mimic punctuated antigenic
changes) with increases in R0 rather than susceptibility. As a result, it failed to identify
some of the punctuated antigenic changes, in particular, for the two A subtypes with larger
variances of R0.
2. Simulating the impact of cross-immunity on long-term epidemic pattern
2.1 Method
To test the impact of cross-immunity, we simulated epidemics under three different
scenarios: 1) As estimated in this study, by setting all cross-immunity terms to the
posterior mean estimates; 2) Stronger cross-immunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1), by
setting cH1←H3 to 0.5, i.e., slightly above the mean estimate for cH3←H1 (i.e. 0.4); and 3) No
interactions, by setting all cross-immunity terms to 0. For each simulation, we initiated the
multi-strain SIRS model (Eqn 1 in the main text) using the posterior estimates at Week 4
(i.e., after discarding the first three weeks of filter spin-off) and ran the model
stochastically from Jan 1998 to July 2018. Weekly values of model parameters (i.e., the
infectious period, immunity period, R0, and cross-immunity terms) not specified in the
above scenarios were set to the mean posterior estimates from the Hong Kong dataset.
Weekly susceptibilities to the three types/subtypes were simulated by the model according
to model-simulated infections, loss of immunity, cross-immunity, replenishment from
newborns, and deaths; however, to simulate the impact from antigenic innovations, we
reset the susceptibility to the posterior mean estimate from the Hong Kong dataset for
weeks identified to experience punctuated antigenic changes (Table 1). As in the model44

inference runs, we set the epidemic seeding (α in Eqn 1) to 0.1 per 100,000 per day for the
all simulations. To account for model stochasticity, we simulated each scenario for 1000
times.
To compute the number of epidemics over the study period, as in (5), we defined the
epidemic baseline, for each type/subtype, as the 40% quantile of the non-zero
corresponding ILI+ records over the ~20 year study period. We then identified 1) all
epidemics including small ones, defined as periods with ≥3 consecutive weeks with ILI+
above the baseline and at least one of the weeks with ILI+ ≥3 times of the baseline; and 2)
all large epidemics, defined as periods with ≥6 consecutive weeks with ILI+ above the
baseline and at least one of the weeks with ILI+ ≥6 times of the baseline. If an identified
epidemic lasted for >1 year, we divided it into multiple epidemics at the year division(s).
Based on the 1st definition, there were 17 A(H1N1), 21 A(H3N2), and 18 B epidemics,
respectively (Fig. S4); and based on the 2nd definition, there were 13, 19, and 14 epidemics
of the three types/subtypes, respectively, during Jan 1998—July 2018 (Fig. S5). We used
the same baselines as observed and definitions to identify and compute the numbers of
epidemics in the simulations and compared them to the observed.
To compare the co-circulation patterns, we categorized the weeks into 8 possible
co-circulation types: 1) none in circulation, i.e., none of the three types/subtypes had ILI+
above their baselines; 2) A(H1N1) alone, i.e., only A(H1N1) had ILI+ above its baseline; and
similarly, 3) A(H3N2) alone and 4) B alone; 5) A(H1N1)+A(H3N2), i.e., only A(H1N1) and
A(H3N2) had ILI+ above their baselines; 6) A(H1N1)+B, i.e., only A(H1N1) and B had ILI+
above their baselines; 7) A(H3N2)+B, i.e., only A(H3N2) and B had ILI+ above their
baselines; and 8) All, i.e., all three types/subtypes had ILI+ above their baselines. We then
computed the percentages of weeks falling in each of the 8 co-circulation types and
compared them to the observed.
2.2 Results
Figures 8-10 show the model-simulated epidemic trajectories compared to the
observations in Hong Kong. As expected, without the constraints by observations (as in a
model-inference system), the errors grew quickly and thus the simulated epidemics
deviated from the observations. However, overall, simulations with cross-immunity in
place were able to better reproduce the observed epidemic pattern (Figs. S8 and S9 vs. Fig.
S10). In particular, those simulations were able to reproduce the long periods with nearzero A(H1N1) activities (e.g., 2002-2005) whereas simulations with no cross-immunity
(Fig. S10) overestimated the circulation of all types/subtypes, especially for A(H1N1).
Comparing the first two scenarios (i.e. both with cross-immunity), simulations with
stronger cross-immunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1) underestimated the circulation of
A(H1N1) and were only able to generate A(H1N1) epidemics following the simulated

punctuated antigenic changes when the susceptibility was reset (Fig. S9 vs. Fig. S8 as
estimated from the data).
Tally over the entire study period, the first two scenarios (i.e., with cross-immunity)
appeared to underestimate the total number of the epidemics (Fig. S11 A and B). However,
this was due to the challenge in generating clear bimodal epidemics within a year as those
observed in Hong Kong. For instance, there were two consecutive A(H1N1) epidemics in
2008; and similarly, A(H3N2) tended to cause two separate epidemics within a year, e.g.,
1999, 2000, 2003, and 2014. The underestimation of number of A(H1N1) epidemics was
severer for scenario 2 when stronger cross-immunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1) was
implemented in the model. Simulations with no cross-immunity were able to generate
more epidemics due to overestimation of circulation during periods without observed
influenza activity (Fig. S10).
Comparing the 8 co-circulation types (Fig. 11C), scenario 1 using the posterior mean
estimates most closely reproduced the observed pattern. In contrast, scenario 2 (i.e.,
stronger cross-immunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1)) largely underestimated the
frequency of A(H1N1) epidemics, whereas scenario 3 (i.e., no cross-immunity) largely
overestimated co-epidemics caused by multiple types/subtypes.

Fig. S2. Model validation using the first synthetic dataset. Posterior estimates for the
incidence rate and population susceptibility (A), basic reproductive number R0 (B),
infectious period (C), immunity period (D), and strength of cross-immunity (E), compared
to the true values. In (A) and (B), dots show the true incidence rates (in black; right y-axis),
susceptibility (in blue; left y-axis), and R0 (in blue; left y-axis); the lines and surrounding
areas show the mean and 95% credible interval (CI) estimates. In (A), vertical dashed black
lines show the true weeks with epochal antigenic changes and red lines show modelestimates. In (C)-(E), red stars show true parameter values; box plots show the median,
75%, and 95% CIs of posterior estimates by the model-inference system; orange dashed
lines show the prior ranges tested.

Fig. S3. Model validation using the second synthetic dataset. Posterior estimates for the
incidence rate and population susceptibility (A), basic reproductive number R0 (B),
infectious period (C), immunity period (D), and strength of cross-immunity (E), compared
to the true values. In (A) and (B), dots show the true incidence rates (in black; right y-axis),
susceptibility (in blue; left y-axis), and R0 (in blue; left y-axis); the lines and surrounding
areas show the mean and 95% credible interval (CI) estimates. In (A), vertical dashed black
lines show the true weeks with epochal antigenic changes and red lines show modelestimates. In (C)-(E), red stars show true parameter values; box plots show the median,
75%, and 95% CIs of posterior estimates by the model-inference system; orange dashed
lines show the prior ranges tested.

Fig. S9. Simulations assuming stronger cross-immunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1).
The cross-immunity parameter cH1←H3 was set to 0.5 and other parameters set to the
posterior mean estimates. Colored lines show simulated weekly infection rates from 1000
individual stochastic model runs (A(H1N1) in orange, A(H3N2) in red, and B in green);
dashed black lines show the weekly mean infection rates across 1000 simulations and solid
black lines show the weekly observations for comparison.

Fig. S11. Epidemic and co-circulation patterns under different strengths of cross-immunity.
Box and whisker plots show the distributions across 1000 simulations for each crossimmunity scenario: scenario 1 as estimated in green; scenario 2 with stronger crossimmunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1) in orange; and scenario 3 with no crossimmunity in grey. Horizontal thick black lines show the median; box edges show the 25th
and 75th percentiles; the whiskers show the full ranges and dots show outliers. Red
segments show the corresponding observations in Hong Kong.
