3 – Cardiotoxicity in Esophageal Cancer

Abstract
Purpose:
Preoperative radiation therapy improves outcomes for operable esophageal cancer
patients, though the proximity of the heart to the esophagus puts patients at risk of
radiation-induced cardiovascular disease. This study characterizes the impact of
radiation therapy and different radiation techniques on cardiovascular morbidity among
a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients.

Methods:
We identified 1,125 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 with
esophageal cancer who received surgery alone, or surgery preceded by either
preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation. We used Medicare claims
to identify severe adverse cardiovascular events in the perioperative and postoperative
periods. Multivariable logistic regression and Fine-Gray models were used to determine
the effect of pre-surgery treatment on the risk of perioperative and postoperative
cardiovascular disease.

Results:
Preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation did not significantly
increase the risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications compared to surgery
alone. Patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation had a 36% increased risk of
having a postoperative cardiovascular event compared to patients treated with surgery

alone (subdistribution hazard ratio [SDHR] 1.36; p=0.035). There was no significant
increase in cardiovascular events among patients treated with preoperative
chemotherapy (SDHR 1.18; p=0.40). Among patients treated with preoperative
chemoradiation, those receiving intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) had a 68%
decreased risk of having a cardiovascular event compared to patients receiving
conventional radiation (SDHR 0.32; p=0.007).

Conclusions:
This study demonstrates an increased risk of cardiovascular complications among
operative esophageal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation, though
these risks might be reduced with more cardioprotective radiation techniques such as
IMRT.

5 – Cardiotoxicity in Esophageal Cancer

Introduction
Radiation therapy represents a central component in the treatment of operable
esophageal cancer1. Among patients with localized or local-regional disease, clinical
trials demonstrate that the use of preoperative radiation delivered concurrently with
chemotherapy followed by surgery confers a survival benefit compared with surgery
alone2,3. The CROSS study in particular found a median survival of 49 months for
patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery compared to 24
months for patients treated with surgery alone3.
The location of the esophagus with respect to the heart puts the heart at risk of
receiving incidental radiation during treatment for esophageal cancer. With other cancer
types, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, large clinical
studies demonstrate a clear link between thoracic radiation and adverse cardiovascular
outcomes4-6. Multiple small institutional studies have demonstrated a potential link
between radiation and cardiovascular disease in esophageal cancer patients treated
with radiotherapy7-11. Additionally, a study evaluating patients within the Surveillance
Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry found increased cardiovascular
mortality among esophageal cancer patients receiving radiation 12. While these older
studies demonstrate increased risks associated with radiation, the delivery of radiation
in esophageal cancer has evolved over the past several decades 13. Modern conformal
treatment techniques, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), offer the ability
to decrease radiation doses to the heart14. The purpose of this large population-based
study was to characterize adverse cardiovascular events associated with radiation

among operable patients with esophageal cancer. Furthermore, this study will analyze
whether IMRT mitigates risks of radiation-induced heart disease.

Methods and Materials
Data Source
We identified esophageal cancer patients from the SEER-Medicare linked
database. The National Cancer Institute oversees the SEER program which collects
data on incident cancers diagnosed across the United States covering approximately
28% of the US population. Medicare provides federally funded health insurance for
people over the age of 65. The SEER-Medicare linkage provides Medicare claims data
for Medicare beneficiaries within the SEER database. Medicare claims indirectly capture
information about cancer treatments and long-term risks of adverse events associated
with treatment. The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Diego
found this study to be exempt from review.

Study Population
Our initial query of the SEER-Medicare database identified 10,353 patients with
histologically confirmed non-metastatic esophageal cancer diagnosed between 2000
and 2011. We included only patients with invasive adenocarcinoma or squamous cell
carcinoma histology. To help maintain focus on adverse outcomes associated with
esophageal cancer, we excluded subjects with a diagnosis of more than one cancer.
Patients were required to have continuous Medicare claims data from 1 year prior to
diagnosis (to calculate pre-existing comorbidity) through death or the end of follow-up.
This required patients to have continuous Medicare Part A and B coverage over this
period, and we excluded subjects with Part C coverage because managed care

organizations do not consistently submit detailed claims data. Additional selection
criteria are described below, and the final study cohort included 1,125 subjects (see
Figure 1 for selection schema).

Study Covariates
Patient demographic and tumor characteristics including histology, stage, and
year of diagnosis were extracted from SEER. We used the Deyo adaptation of the
Charlson comorbidity index to calculate pre-existing comorbidity from inpatient and
outpatient Medicare claims during the year prior to diagnosis15. This study separately
incorporated pre-existing cardiovascular disease as a study variable (described below),
therefore we modified the Charlson score by removing cardiovascular disease to avoid
double counting. We identified chemotherapy, radiation, and esophageal surgery using
previously established methods16-18 that rely on Medicare claims and International
Classification of Diseases 9th edition (ICD-9) Procedure and Diagnosis codes, as well as
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes (see Supplemental
Table 1 for codes). We identified individual fractions of radiation from radiation
treatment claims, and considered only definitive courses of radiation defined as 20 or
more fractions of radiation. We assumed that a break between fractions of radiation of
more than 30 days indicated a separate (and subsequent) course of radiation. We
identified patients who received IMRT through radiation planning and treatment claims
specific to IMRT. We defined concurrent chemoradiation as any administration of
chemotherapy during or within a 2 week window surrounding the course of radiation.

We excluded the few patients who received brachytherapy, or proton therapy.
Additionally, we excluded the small number of patients who received preoperative
radiation alone without concurrent chemotherapy (insufficient numbers for analysis), as
well as patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (see Figure 1).

Cardiovascular events
The primary study endpoint included clinically relevant cardiovascular events
potentially associated with radiation ascertained with ICD-9 and HCPCS codes
(Supplemental Table 1). This composite endpoint included hospitalization associated
with any of the following: acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve surgery, pericardial
disease, or congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy. We classified cardiovascular
endpoints as preexisting, perioperative, and postoperative based on timing with respect
to cancer diagnosis and surgery. Preexisting events occurred during the year prior to
cancer diagnosis. Perioperative events occurred between the date of esophageal
surgery and 30 days after discharge from the hospital. Postoperative events occurred
more than 30 days after discharge.

Statistical analysis
We characterized the study cohort with median follow-up time, calculated from
the date of surgery through death or last follow-up, and the median and 5-year survival,
estimated with Kaplan-Meier analyses. We categorized patients into three groups based

on the type of preoperative treatment received: preoperative chemotherapy alone,
preoperative chemoradiation, or no preoperative treatment. Among these three
treatment groups we assessed for differences in baseline patient and tumor
characteristics with Fisher’s exact tests. We used multivariable models to determine
whether the risks of perioperative and postoperative cardiovascular events varied by
preoperative treatment. Multivariable models incorporated potential confounding factors
including patient age, race, sex, marital status, year of diagnosis, tumor histology, stage
(localized vs. regional), Charlson comorbidity score, preexisting cardiovascular disease,
and the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. The impact of preoperative treatment on
perioperative cardiovascular events was assessed with a multivariable logistic
regression. The impact of preoperative treatment on postoperative cardiovascular
events was assessed with a multivariable Fine-Gray regression considering death as a
competing event, censoring at last follow-up. To determine whether the risk of
postoperative cardiovascular events varied by patient characteristics, we performed an
additional analysis introducing interaction terms with treatment and select variables into
the multivariable model. A significant interaction would indicate that the impact of
treatment on the risk of cardiovascular disease varied by that patient characteristic. The
5-year incidence of cardiovascular events were assessed with cumulative incidence
analyses. Due to the small number of cardiac deaths (N=58) we did not assess
cardiovascular mortality in this analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with p-values < 0.05 considered significant.

Results
Among the 1,125 esophageal cancer patients in this study the median follow-up
time was 1.5 years, and for the patients alive at the end of the study (N=355; 32%), the
median follow-up time was 5.3 years. The median survival for the entire cohort
measured from the date of surgery was 1.9 years, and the 5-year survival was 33%.
When considering preoperative treatment we found that 613 patients (54%) received
surgery alone, 137 (12%) received preoperative chemotherapy, and 375 (33%) received
preoperative chemoradiation. Table 1 demonstrates patient characteristics stratified by
treatment group. Compared to patients receiving surgery alone, the patients receiving
chemoradiation were younger, more likely married, diagnosed at a later time period,
were more likely to have regional disease on presentation, and were more likely to have
received chemotherapy after surgery.
In the perioperative period, 302 patients (27%) experienced a cardiovascular
event, with the majority of these classified as congestive heart failure (N=259; 23%), or
acute myocardial infarction (N=61; 5.4%). On multivariable analysis, we found that the
risk of perioperative cardiovascular events did not correlate with the type of preoperative
treatment. Compared to the surgery alone group, there was no increased risk of
developing a perioperative cardiovascular event among those receiving preoperative
chemotherapy (odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.27; p=0.50),
or among those receiving preoperative chemoradiation (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.67-1.26;
p=0.97).

12 – Cardiotoxicity in Esophageal Cancer

During the postoperative period, the 5-year cumulative incidence of
cardiovascular events among all patients was 25.7% (Figure 2), with most of the events
consisting of congestive heart failure, pericardial disease, or myocardial infarction
(Table 2). Multivariate analysis found that patients treated with preoperative
chemoradiation had a 36% increased risk of developing a cardiovascular event
compared to those undergoing surgery alone (sub-distribution hazard ratio [SDHR]
1.36, 95% CI 1.02-1.80; p=0.035). We did not find a significant increase in postoperative
cardiovascular events risk among those receiving preoperative chemotherapy (SDHR
1.18, 95% CI 0.80-1.75; p=0.40). The impact of preoperative chemoradiotherapy on
postoperative cardiovascular outcomes did not differ according to patient age, race, sex,
marital status, year of diagnosis, tumor histology, stage (localized vs. regional),
Charlson comorbidity score, or preexisting cardiovascular disease (all interaction pvalues >0.05).
Among the cohort of patients receiving chemoradiotherapy, 71 (19%) received
IMRT. The 5-year cumulative incidence of postoperative cardiovascular events was
12.1% (95% CI 5.1-22.2%) for patients receiving IMRT compared to 33.2% (95% CI
27.3-39.2%) for patients receiving conventional radiation (Figure 3). On multivariable
analysis, patients receiving IMRT had a 68% decreased risk of having a postoperative
cardiovascular event compared to patients receiving conventional radiation (SDHR
0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.73; p=0.007).

13 – Cardiotoxicity in Esophageal Cancer

Discussion
This study demonstrates a link between the receipt of radiation and long-term
postoperative cardiovascular outcomes among operable esophageal cancer patients
receiving curative intent treatment. Our key finding of a 36% increased relative risk of
adverse, clinically relevant cardiovascular events supports the existing literature
evaluating the risk of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity in esophageal cancer. A series of
single institution studies with sample sizes ranging from 15 to 123 have described a
similar association between radiation in esophageal cancer and a variety of
cardiovascular endpoints. This includes studies identifying a link between radiation and
increased myocardial perfusion defects7, decreased ejection fraction8,9, and clinically
significant cardiac toxicity10,11. Similarly, a study evaluating patients within SEER found
a 2.8% absolute increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease among
esophageal cancer patients treated with radiation 12. Clinical trial data support a cancerspecific survival advantage associated with preoperative radiation in esophageal
cancer3,19, though our study in conjunction with existing research highlights the potential
for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
The timing of cardiovascular events after radiation deserves further discussion.
Imaging research demonstrates that myocardial perfusion defects can occur as early as
6 months after treatment20-22. Furthermore, research in breast cancer demonstrates that
the long-term cardiovascular effects of radiation stretch over a patient’s lifetime 4,23. The
probability of long-term survival with esophageal cancer is lower than breast cancer,
though given the trend towards improved survival over time with esophageal cancer24,

one could argue that the clinical importance of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease
among esophageal cancer survivors will increase in the future.
Another key finding of this study relates to the observed reduction in
postoperative cardiovascular events among patients receiving IMRT. Research
evaluating radiation dosimetry demonstrates that the more conformal radiation dose
distributions with IMRT have the potential to reduce radiation doses to the heart
compared to conventional forms of radiation 14,25-28. Similarly, other retrospective
analyses have found potential reductions in cardiovascular toxicity associated with
IMRT compared to older radiation techniques29,30. Furthermore, a cancer registry study
found that IMRT was associated with a decreased risk of cardiac mortality compared to
conventional radiation31. The potential benefits of more conformal radiation modalities
raise the question about the possible utility of proton therapy in esophageal cancer,
which can further reduce radiation doses to the heart 32. A recent early report of a phase
II randomized trial comparing proton therapy to IMRT demonstrated reduced toxicity
among the proton therapy patients, though did not specifically report on cardiovascular
toxicity33. An ongoing phase III randomized trial with a co-primary endpoint of overall
survival and adverse cardiopulmonary events will help define the potential benefit of
proton therapy in esophageal cancer (NCT03801876).
An important consideration of this study relates to the potential contribution of
chemotherapy on the risks of adverse cardiovascular events. Combined chemotherapy
and radiation represents the standard approach in the definitive management of nonmetastatic esophageal cancer1. The typical chemotherapy doublets used concurrently

with radiation in esophageal cancer include 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, or carboplatin
and paclitaxel1. 5-fluorouracil can cause coronary spasms or ischemia, and paclitaxel
can cause bradycardia34. Furthermore, all of these chemotherapy agents have the
capacity for radiosensitization35, which could influence the adverse impact of radiation
on the heart. Whether different concurrent chemotherapy agents delivered with radiation
lead to different risks of cardiotoxicity remains an important but unanswered question.
This study has limitations worth mentioning. The SEER-Medicare linked
database lacks specific details of radiation including the radiation dose and target, both
of which could impact the amount and anatomic distribution of radiation received by the
heart, which could influence the patient-specific risks of cardiovascular disease.
Furthermore, this study lacked data on important cardiovascular risk factors including
smoking, obesity, exercise, and family history, any of which could mitigate or moderate
the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study included Medicare
beneficiaries over the age of 65, therefore the findings in this study may not generalize
to a younger population. Finally, with the increased knowledge and awareness
surrounding radiation-induced heart disease, one could hypothesize that radiation
oncologists treating patients today might prioritize cardiac sparing in their radiation
plans, which could decrease the risks of radiation-induced heart disease for patients
treated in current practice.
Despite these limitations, this population-based study demonstrates that
preoperative chemoradiation increases the risk of cardiovascular complications among
esophageal cancer patients treated with curative intent. Furthermore, this study

demonstrates the capacity of more advanced radiation techniques such as IMRT to
reduce these risks, which provides a rationale to use cardioprotective radiation
techniques. While additional research incorporating radiation dose is needed to quantify
patient-specific risks, the findings of this study can help patients and radiation
oncologists better understand the risks of radiation in esophageal cancer.
