Abstract
Background: Helicobacter pylori is responsible for gastric cancer in approximately tens of
millions of patients. Gastric cancer in Sudan represents one of the top causing death among
cancers with about 686 cases per year and a 2.7 % mortality rate. IL-1RN VNTR polymorphism
has been reported to increase the risk of gastric cancer.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the association of the 86 bp VNTR
polymorphism of IL- 1RN gene and the susceptibility to H. pylori infection and gastric cancer in
the Sudanese population.
Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 114 subjects. Of whom 60 had
gastritis and duodenitis, 26 had a peptic ulcer, 16 had gastric cancer and 12 had normal
gastroscopy findings. H. pylori infection was investigated by specific 16S rRNA. And IL-1RN
VNTR polymorphism at intron 2 was genotyped using the PCR method and direct sequencing for
random samples.
Results: The positive H. pylori infection rate among participants was 47.37%. There is a lack of a
significant difference in IL- 1RN genotype with H. pylori infection (p-value=1.0000). The IL-1 RN
L/L genotype was significantly more frequent in a patient with benign disorders (gastritis or
duodenitis or peptic ulcer), Odd=6.000 (95% CI =1.750-20.57, P=0.0056). While the heterozygote
genotype 2/L was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer with OR = 12.83 (95% CI =
1.261-130.6, P=0.0302).
Conclusion: Independently carriage of IL-1RN *2 allele was associated with increased risk of
gastric cancer in the Sudanese population. Notwithstanding the relatively small sample size of the
study population, our findings show that the host genetic can be a useful tool for identifying highrisk individuals among dyspeptic patients; and also underscore the role played by host genetics in
gastric carcinogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Sudan concerning
this issue.

1. Introduction
Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common human infection worldwide,
approximately 50% of the world’s populations are infected and this is made human the
main reservoir for H. pylori.(1,

2)

Although the high infection rates among the world

population, most of them develop no clinical symptoms and continue their life with
chronic gastritis.(3-5) Unfortunately, still high percentages of the infected populations
might develop severe gastric pathology. Approximately 17% of them will develop peptic
ulcers and one-quarter of such patients even experience ulcer complications,(6) while
(approximately 1%) will progress to gastric cancers.(6,

7)

In terms of numbers, it is

expected that several hundreds of millions will suffer from peptic ulceration and tens of
millions might progress to gastric cancer.(4)
The presence of a pro-inflammatory response and the level of gastric acid secretion
contribute significantly to the development of either peptic ulcer disease or atrophic
gastritis.(8,

9)

IL-1 family has a pivotal role in the innate immunity and regulatory

functions in the adaptive immune system.(10) IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β), is the most
influencing pro-inflammatory cytokine while IL-1RN is a naturally occurring antiinflammatory cytokine.(11-13) It is competitively bound to IL-1 receptors (IL-IR and ILIIR), and thereby regulates the biological activity of IL-1α and IL-1β and modulates their
potentially damaging effects.(14-18) However, the therapeutic administration of IL-1ra, as a
recombinant protein, has proven effective to prevent tissue damage(10) and IL-1ra
concentrations must be at least 100-fold higher than IL-1β concentrations to functionally
block the biologic effects of IL-1β on target cells; hence, considerable production of IL1ra is necessary for local tissues to stop the effects of IL-1β.(19)
The IL-1 genes cluster spanning approximately 430 kb, which is located on the long arm
of human chromosome 2q13-21, comprising IL-1A, IL-1B, and IL-1RN. IL-1RN
(Location: 2q14.1, MIM:147679) encodes IL-1ra, the endogenous receptor antagonist of
IL-1α and IL-1β, using the functional part of IL-1 thereby modulates their potentially
damaging effects on target cell.(15, 20, 21) The IL-1RN gene has been linked with a broad
range of chronic inflammatory diseases and enhanced IL-1β secretion.(11,

22-26)

The

imbalance between IL‐1 and IL‐1ra has a crucial impact in developing inflammatory

disorders in local tissues taking part in numerous illnesses, including infectious diseases,
through overproduction of IL-1α, β and/or underproduction of IL-1ra.(27-29)
Polymorphisms in IL-1 and IL-1RN have been reported to be related to variations in the
production levels of IL-1 (IL-1B and IL-1A) and IL-1ra.(13, 30, 31) The most intensively
studied IL-1RN polymorphism connected to susceptibility to H. pylori infection and
gastric cancer outcome is a penta-allelic 86-bp VNTR (variable number of tandem
repeats) polymorphism that is located in intron 2.(12,
contains four repeats

32-34)

The most typical variants

named allele IL1RN*1 and variants with 2 repeats (allele

IL1RN*2). While other alleles, 3 repeats (allele IL1RN*4), 5 repeats (allele IL1RN*3) and
6 repeats (allele IL1RN*5),(35) occur at a combined frequency of <5%.(14) Vamvakopoulus
et. al., in 2000, revealed the sixth variant of this polymorphism containing only one
repeat (allele IL1RN*0).(36) Studies from different ethnic groups have reported that in
individuals infected with H. pylori, IL-1RN*2 allele is associated with increased
production of IL-1β which leading to severe and sustained inflammation, gastric atrophy,
hypochlorhydria, and ultimately to the development of gastric cancer.(22,

31, 32, 37-39)

Contrariwise, Asian studies have been less conclusive on the relation between IL-1RN
polymorphism, H. pylori infection and gastric cancer.(40, 41) It seems that there is an ethnic
variability with regard to IL-1RN polymorphisms frequency and their association with H.
pylori infection and gastric cancer. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no
previous studies in Sudan have investigated the role of the IL-1RN polymorphisms in H.
pylori infection and gastric cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the
association of the 86 bp VNTR polymorphism of IL- 1RN gene and the susceptibility to
H. pylori infection and gastric cancer in the Sudanese population.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Ethical consideration
This study was approved by the Khartoum ministry of the health research department,
University of Khartoum and Research Ethics Committees of hospitals.
2.2 Study design and Study sittings
The study was conducted in major public and private hospitals in mainly Khartoum state
from June 2018 to January 2019. These hospitals include Ibin Sina specialized hospital
which is a public hospital. And three private hospitals which include Modern Medical
Centre, Al-Shorta hospital and Al Faisal Specialized Hospital. The distribution of
participants’ samples from hospitals in percentage is given in Figure1. All sample
processes were carried out in the Molecular biological lab at the Faculty of Medical
Laboratory Sciences at the University of Khartoum.
2.3 Study population
The study population composed of 114 subjects consisted of 54 H. pylori positive
patients (33 male) of whom 29 had gastritis or/and duodenitis, 16 had a peptic ulcer, and
4 had gastric cancer, and 60 were H. pylori negative subjects (34 males) who regarded as
controls, see Table 1. The subjects were recruited from the Endoscopy unit of public and
private hospitals in Khartoum state. The diagnosis of gastroduodenal diseases was based
on the assessment of an experienced gastroenterologist and the investigation of gastric
cancer was confirmed by histopathology. The distribution of participants according to
endoscopy series and clinical symptoms were presented in Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 2.
Each participant was interviewed using a structured questionnaire to seek information on
residence, gastroenterological symptoms, and other variables. All interviews were
conducted in the hospital before enrolling the participants. The selection criteria included
the Sudanese population from both sexes, no antibiotic or NSAIDS uses. All the
participants were informed with the objectives and purposes of the study and the written
informed consents were taken.

PCR amplification was performed with Maxime PCR PreMix Kit (i-Taq) (iNtRON
BIOTECHNOLOGY, Seongnam, Korea) and a PCR thermocycler (SensoQuest,
Germany). The reaction mixtures used for PCR contained 2.5U of i-Taq TM DNA
polymerase (5U/µl), 2.5mM of each deoxynucleoside tri- phosphates (dNTPs), 1X of
PCR reaction buffer (10X),1X of gel loading buffer and 1µl of DNA template. The
temperature cycle for the PCR was an initial step of 3min at 94°C, followed by
denaturation for 30sec at 94°C, annealing for 30sec at 53°C and primer extension for
45sec at 72°C. After the 40th cycle, the final extension step was prolonged for 5min to
complete the synthesis of strands.
PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis. 3µl of each PCR products was loaded
onto 2% agarose gels stained with 3µl ethidium bromide (10mg/ml) and subjected to
electrophoresis in 1x Tris EDTA Buffer (TEB buffer) (89mM of Tris base, 89mM Boric
acid and 2mM EDTA dissolved in 1Litter H2O) for 30 min at 120V and 50mA. The gel
was visualized under UV light illumination. A 100MW DNA ladder (iNtRON
BIOTECHNOLOGY, Seongnam, Korea) was included in each gel as a molecular size
standard. The amplified products for the specific 16SrRNA gene is 522bp.

and 5’-TCCTGGTCTGCAGGTAA-‘3. The amplification conditions were 94°C for
1min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 1min, 60°C for 1min, 72°C for 1min, and a final extension at
72°C for 7 minutes. The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2%
agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. A 1-kilobase DNA ladder was used to
standardize alleles’ sizes and code conventionally as follows: allele 1 (A1)=410bp (4
repeats), allele 2 (A2)=240bp (2 repeats), allele 3 (A3)=500bp (5 repeats), allele 4
(A4)=325bp (3 repeats), and allele 5 (A5)=595bp (6 repeats). For statistical analysis
purposes and in accordance with a previous report conducted by Machado et al., these
alleles are classified into the short (allele *2=*2) and long alleles (alleles *1, *3, 4, and
5=L). The genotyping patterns will classify as L/L, L/*2, and *2/*2 .(38, 44)
3.8 Sequencing and sequence analysis
DNA purification and Sanger dideoxy sequencing were performed commercially by

Macrogen Inc, Korea. For each sequence, two chromatograms (forward and reverse),

were visualized and analyzed by using the Finch TV program version 1.4.0.(45) The Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) was used to look
for and assess nucleotide sequence similarities; also to check the quality of our PCR
procedure for detecting of VTRP IL-1RN.(46)
2.9 Statistical analysis
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of genotype distributions was assessed by χ2 test or Fisher's
test. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed to calculate proportions, percentages,
means, and standard deviations. According to the prevalence of H. pylori infection,
differences in frequency distribution by age were assessed by the Mann-Whitney test.
While differences in frequency distribution among the categorical demographic
characteristics of the study population were examined with χ2 test or Fisher's test.
Associations of IL-1RN genotypes with H. pylori infection and endoscopic series were
assessed by odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional
logistic regression analysis. Differences were considered to indicate statistical
significance if P<0.05. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS version 19).

3. Result
The positive H. pylori infection rate among participants was 47.37%. No significant
differences were noted for H. pylori infection rates by age, gender, and residence. A
significant association was found with the type of hospitals (p=0.019) where participants
from private hospitals involved a high percentage of infection.
Fifty-four patients and fifty-seven of sixty uninfected subjects were successfully typed
for the IL-1RN polymorphism. In this study, six IL-1RN genotypes (1/1, 1/2, 2/2, 1/3, 2/3,
and 1/4) were included while allele 5 (6 repeats) and allele 6 (0 repeats) of IL-1ra and
homozygotes of the rare alleles (A3 and A4) were not detected in both groups of
participants (infected and uninfected), see Figure 3. The frequency of IL-1RN alleles is
presented in Table4. IL-1RN allelic distributions did not deviate significantly from those
expected in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for control subjects (for uninfected subjects
p=0.5923; and for subjects with normal gastroscopy series p=0.5983).
The present study found a lack of a significant difference in IL- 1RN genotype with H.
pylori infection (p-value=1.0000), as shown in Table 5. The homozygote allele 2* (2/2
repeats) and the heterozygote allele 3* and allele 4* were found only in patients infected
with H. pylori, one patient for each.
A profile of IL-1RN polymorphism in relation to gastric pathologies reveals that the IL1RN*L allele was significantly associated with gastric pathologies risk if all patients were
included (P=0.0261), see Table 6. The IL-1 RN L/L genotype was significantly more
frequent in a patient with benign disorders (gastritis or duodenitis or peptic ulcer),
Odd=6.000 (95% CI =1.750-20.57, P=0.0056), as shown in Table 7. Moreover, there is a
significant association between gastric cancer and the carriage of IL-1RN *2 allele
(P=0.0504), see Table 6. The homozygous ILRN 2/2 genotype was found in only one
patient with antral gastritis while the heterozygote genotype 2/L was associated with an
increased risk of gastric cancer with OR = 12.83 (95% CI = 1.261-130.6, P=0.0302). The
risk for IL-1RN*2 allele carriers increased by 15.75 (95% CI=1.448-171.3, P = 0.0235) as
shown in Table 8. The gastric cancer risk was more evident for IL-1RN 2/L with
OR=18.00 (95% CI =1.631-198.6, P = 0.0183).(data not shown). However, the

4. Discussion
In this study, the analysis of IL-1RN 86bp VNTR polymorphism at intron 2 showed a
significant association between gastric cancer and independently carriage of IL-1RN *2
allele (P=0.0504) in the Sudanese population. This finding is in agreement with other
studies from Portugal, Italy, and the UK which also found that the presence of IL-1RN *2
increased the risk of gastric cancer.(31, 38, 47, 48) Since 2000 when Omer et al., reported the
first significant association between gastric cancer risk and polymorphism in the genes
IL-1B and IL-1RN among Scottish and Polish patients,(31) a lot of studies from different
ethnic groups and populations have pointed out this relation as well.(32,

49, 50)

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no data regarding these polymorphisms are
available in Sudan where gastric cancer, according to GLOBOCAN 2018, represents one
of the top causing death among cancers with about 686 cases per year and 2.7 %
mortality rate.(51) However, most of the studies have observed this association with an IL1RN 2/2 homozygous genotype(31, 38, 48) but we found this association with a heterozygous
genotype (IL-1RN 2/L) with OR=12.83 (95% CI = 1.261-130.6, P = 0.0302) which is
consistent with other studies conducted in Italy,(47,

52)

Brazil,(53) Taiwan,(54) China,(55)

Turkey(39) and Arabic population (Omani and Algerian)(56,

57)

that found the same

association of gastric cancer with a IL-1RN 2/L heterozygous genotype.

Moreover, the risk for IL-1RN *2 carriers increased by15.75 (95% CI=1.448-171.3, P =
0.0235) in H. pylori infected patients. Similarly, a significantly increased risk of gastric
cancer with IL-1RN *2 carriers who infected with H. pylori was noticed with a moderate
increase among Hispanics, but not among the Asian population.

(23, 58-60)

In 2005, Ruzzo

et al. studied the potential etiologic role of IL-1RN VNTR polymorphism in H. pylorinegative, Italian gastric cancer patients. And he found that the IL-1RN*2 allele may
contribute to intestinal gastric cancer risk in the absence of concomitant H. pylori
infection which suggests that the IL-1RN*2 allele could contribute to disease risk
independently.(47) However, other dietary environmental mutagens and carcinogens may
interact with the pro-inflammatory cytokines on the gastric mucosa then induce gastric
cancer even in the absence of H. pylori infection.(61,

62)

N-nitroso compounds and

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been found to increase IL-1β production levels.
(63-65)

Moreover, IL-1RN and IL-1B have been reported to independently enhance cell

proliferation and tumorigenesis. (66, 67)
The variation in IL-1RN gastric cancer predisposition risk between studies could be due
to the different genetic backgrounds in different ethnic groups or due in part to the
variation in the frequency of the IL-1RN 2/2 homozygous genotype in the study
populations. In our study, only one patient had IL-1RN 2/2 homozygous genotype and
actually, a potential limitation of our investigation is the relatively small sample size. A
low prevalence of IL-1RN allele 2 has observed previously in African-American(68) and
black African populations.

(69, 70)

The frequency of the IL-1RN *2 allele in the Sudanese

study population was 9.4% which is low compared with 26% and 15% in Caucasian and
Omani populations, respectively but high in comparison with the Asian population for
whom frequencies of around 6% are reported.(31, 41, 52, 56)
In the African population, data are scarce regarding the effects of IL-1RN VNTR
polymorphism on gastric pathology. In this study, we found a significantly prevalent of
IL-1 RN L/L genotype in patients with benign disorders (gastritis or duodenitis or peptic
ulcer), Odd=6.000 (95% CI =1.750-20.57, P=0.0056). This finding is in concordance
partially with the result reported by Kimang’ a et al. in an African population in 2012 that

the IL-1RN L/L were significantly more frequent in H. pylori associated gastric
pathologies (gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastrointestinal reflux disease). (70)
With regard to the susceptibility to H. pylori infection, we found a lack of association
between IL-1RN 86bp VNTR polymorphism and susceptibility to H. pylori infection.
This negative finding is similar to those reported in Japanese and UK populations.

(44, 71)

The true nature of the relationship between the polymorphisms of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, susceptibility to H. pylori infection and development of gastric cancer is likely
to be extremely complex and still unclear. Although the high prevalence of H. pylori
infection (about 50% of the world’s population), only 15% of these individuals go on to
develop clinically significant diseases.(72) The accepted model for the variation in H.
pylori-associated diseases relates to the amount of stomach acid secretion, the site of H.
pylori colonization and the distribution of the infection; i.e., antral gastritis favors
duodenal ulcer formation whereas corpus-predominant gastritis favors the development
of a gastric ulcer and sometimes progressing to metaplasia and adenocarcinoma. The
sever impaired acid secretion that typically results from diffuse gastritis allows H. pylori
to colonize the corpus. (73, 74) However, IL-1B and IL-1RN polymorphisms increase IL-1β
production which suppresses gastric acid secretion and therefore potentially influences H.
pylori distribution within the stomach and predisposes individuals to gastric cancer. (31, 37)
These facts together lead us to suggest that the genetic association of IL-1RN
polymorphisms with gastric cancer is a result of the complex interaction between the host
inflammatory response and H. pylori but not primarily related to increased susceptibility
to H. pylori infection. Moreover, a number of studies conducted in different ethnic groups
showed an association between IL-1RN polymorphisms and H. pylori-mediated diseases
(gastritis, duodenitis, ulcer, and cancer), see Table 9 for more illustration.

H. pylori is an extremely common and highly genetically diverse bacteria that are able to
alter the host physiology and immune response allowing it to persist for the life of the
host. Eradication of H. pylori could be a double-edged sword, reducing the incidence of
gastric pathologies and gastric cancer while increasing the risk of esophageal diseases
and allergies. Many bacterial and Host genotypes act in concert to determine which
individuals are at the highest risk of disease. The findings of our study indicate that the
IL-1RN L/2 genotype is significantly associated with the risk of gastric cancer thus
intervention (i.e., eradication treatment) aimed at patients with this genotype has the
potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer substantially.
Notwithstanding the limitations of the present study which include the relatively small
number of participants, cross-sectional design, depending on 16S rRNA for H. pylori
investigation which did not exclude the previous infection of individual and the
investigation has been done in only one gene (IL-1RN) without invoking other
carcinogenic factors, our findings show that the host genetic can be a useful tool for
identifying high-risk individuals among dyspeptic patients; and also underscore the role
played by host genetics in gastric carcinogenesis. Further national studies with a large
sample size are needed to determine the effect of host- and H. pylori- related genotypes
on the development of gastric cancer.

In conclusion:
Independently carriage of IL-1RN *2 allele contributes significantly to the risk of gastric
cancer in the Sudanese population. And this risk is further increased with concomitant H.
pylori infection. Notwithstanding the relatively small sample size of the study population,
our findings show that the host genetic can be a useful tool for identifying high-risk
individuals among dyspeptic patients; and also underscore the role played by host
genetics in gastric carcinogenesis.
