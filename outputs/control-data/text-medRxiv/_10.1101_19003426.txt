Abstract. A cluster randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to

39

estimate protective efficacy of a spatial repellent against malaria infection at Sumba, Indonesia.

40

Following radical cure in 1,341 children aged ³ 6 months - £5 years in 24 clusters, households

41

were given transfluthrin or placebo passive emanators. Monthly blood screening and biweekly

42

human-landing mosquito catches (HLC) were performed during 10-months baseline (June 2015

43

to March 2016) and a 24-month intervention period (April 2016 to April 2018). Screening

44

detected 164 first-time malaria infections and an accumulative total of 459 infections in 667

45

subjects in placebo-control households; and 134 first-time and 253 accumulative total infections

46

among 665 subjects in active intervention households. The 24-cluster protective effect of 27.7%

47

and 31.3%, for time to first-event and overall (total new) infections, respectively, was not

48

statistically significant. Purportedly, this was likely due in part to zero to low incidence in some

49

clusters, undermining the ability to detect a protective effect from spatial repellent intervention.

50

Subgroup analysis of 19 clusters where at least one malaria infection occurred during the

51

baseline showed 33.3% and 40.9% (statistically significant at 1-sided 5% significance level; p

52

=0.0236) protective effect to first-infection and overall infections, respectively. Among 12

53

moderate- to high-risk clusters, a statistically significant decrease on infection by the spatial

54

repellent was detected (60% protective efficacy). Primary entomological analysis of impact was

55

inconclusive and proved not statistically significant. While this study suggests protective effects

56

of the intervention, additional evidence is required to demonstrate that spatial repellents provide

57

an operationally feasible and effective means of reducing malaria transmission.

INTRODUCTION
It has been nearly 75 years since the role of spatial repellency (deterrency or avoidance)

62

was first described as a potentially beneficial attribute in malaria control, showing chemicals

63

could effectively disrupt normal host-seeking mosquito behavior and interrupt contact with

64

humans, thus preventing disease transmission.1-3 Spatial repellency is used here as a general term

65

to refer to a range of insect behaviors induced by airborne, volatile chemicals that ultimately

66

result in a reduction in human-vector contact. These behaviors include movement away from a

67

treated space with chemical stimulus, interference with host detection (attraction-inhibition)

68

and/or interference with feeding response (feeding-inhibition).4-7 Spatial repellency can be

69

measured and distinguished from other chemical actions, primarily contact irritancy and toxicity,

70

in the laboratory8, 9 and in semi-field evaluations.10, 11 Which behavior is elicited by a volatile

71

chemical depends on the concentration or dose-exposure interaction by the mosquito in the

72

treated space. For example, toxicity occurs at higher chemical doses while deterrence (behavioral

73

avoidance) can result from lower, sub-lethal chemical concentrations.12 Currently, the majority

74

of commercial spatial repellent products utilize either low concentrations of short-duration

75

United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) registered synthetic pyrethroids

76

(pyrethrin, metofluthrin and more recently transfluthrin)13 or botanical-based compounds.14, 15

77

The World Health Organization (WHO) Vector Control Advisory Group (VCAG)

78

assesses evidence on the epidemiological effectiveness of new vector control interventions and

79

by doing so supports WHO’s development of policy recommendations, including the potential

80

use of spatial repellents as a public health vector control strategy.16 Reviewed by VCAG since

81

2014, the assessment of rigorous epidemiological evidence for endorsing a policy

82

recommendation of a spatial repellent intervention class remains limited and deemed

insufficient.17 A malaria prevalence study in China evaluating mosquito coils containing 0.03%

84

transfluthrin demonstrated a 77% reduction in human Plasmodium falciparum cases18 and the

85

use of coils containing 0.00975% metofluthrin provided 52% protective efficacy (PE) against

86

new (incident) malaria infections in Indonesia.19 Although primary outcomes from both studies

87

were encouraging, neither met the required VCAG evidence for full pubic health assessment

88

either due to lack of rigor in study design (small cluster number in Indonesia) and/or being

89

underpowered (both studies).20 The importance of a WHO policy for implementation of spatial

90

repellents in malaria control programs could dramatically increase investments by private

91

industry to develop chemicals that operate through modes of actions to elicit vector behavior

92

changes other than purely toxicity. This would potentially introduce a new generation of

93

effective active ingredients and product formulations into the disease control/eradication

94

arsenal.21, 22 In combination with existing WHO-recommended malaria control interventions,

95

spatial repellents have the potential to add significant protective benefit, especially where

96

traditional long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS) may not be

97

sufficiently protective (e.g. early-evening blood feeding vectors when LLINs are not in use

98

and/or where vectors do not or limit resting time indoors on insecticide-treated surfaces), be

99

unavailable, or are impractical and/or infeasible (emergency relief operations). Control or

100

elimination of malaria in these circumstances will require innovative approaches; as example

101

spatial repellents providing a highly beneficial protective role against transmission.23, 24

102

The current claim of a spatial repellent intervention class for public health value is

103

‘deployment of a spatial repellent will prevent human-vector contact to reduce pathogen

104

transmission’. The role of spatial repellency in public health is dependent on assessing whether

105

or not human protection is rigorously evidenced, thus the requirement of clinical trials using a

prototype spatial repellent product for the intervention class. With this epidemiological primary

107

endpoint in mind, the objectives of the current RCT were to build upon previous epidemiological

108

findings and provide rigorous evidence of a spatial repellent that provides a sufficient protective

109

effect against malaria infection risk and demonstrate risk reduction by decreasing relevant

110

entomological measures (e.g., anopheline human landing (biting) density, age-grading parity

111

and/or sporozoite infectivity rates) in endemic communities. The rationale for conducting the

112

RCT at Sumba Island stems from an essential requirement by WHO VCAG that more evidence

113

of human health impact is needed to recommend a WHO global public health spatial repellent

114

policy and that such evidence should come from varied malaria endemicity settings (low,

115

moderate and high).16 The underlying reason for integrating entomological measures (above) in

116

the RCT was to identify correlations, if any, with PE which could then be used in future trials

117

with appropriate minimum thresholds required to demonstrate non-inferiority of next-generation

118

spatial repellent products.

METHODS

121

The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02294188) and performed

122

according to The International Conference on Harmonisation's (ICH) Guideline for Good

123

Clinical Practice (GCP; document E6) (R1) and The OECD Principles of Good Laboratory

124

Practice (GLP) based on The National Agency of Drug and Food Control, Indonesia regulations.

125

There were no changes to methods after trial commencement.25, 26

the University of Notre Dame (Protocol #14-01-1448) and endorsed by the Eijkman Institute

130

Research Ethics Committee, Jakarta, Indonesia. Consent was obtained from parents or guardians

131

of child recruits following EC guidelines. For sentinel households participating in entomological

132

collections, signed consent was sought from the head-of-household. No data on individuals was

133

collected during the entomological collections. During the consenting process, the study was

134

described and the relevant consent form read in local dialect by study staff. The consent form

135

detailed the design of the study including radical cure, the purpose of collecting and storage of

136

blood samples (towards laboratory-based malaria diagnosis), descriptions of the study risks,

137

benefits, and procedures of therapeutic radical cure and follow-up. For households recruited for

138

entomology measures, the consent form detailed the design of mosquito collections and

139

descriptions of study risks, benefits and procedures of human landing catch (HLC).

140

Participants who were illiterate were asked to appose their thumbprint and, when

141

possible, a literate witness was asked to sign (i.e., a witness selected/known by the participant

142

and having no connection to the research team). All households were provided with a signed

143

copy of the consent form after agreeing to participate in the study. Adverse events were captured

144

during participant follow-up and entomological collections and reported to monitoring

145

authorities in accordance with the approved protocol. All participants were free to drop out of the

146

study at any time, regardless of reason or having to provide one, and without prejudice.

Study setting. The study was conducted in Southwest and West Sumba districts, East Nusa

149

Tenggara Province, Indonesia (Figure 1). The circa 400,000 residents of the two districts occupy

150

175 village ‘groups’ (desas) and several small-sized towns.27 Thirteen village groups, with

151

resident populations ranging between 1,067 and 3,904 (avg. 2,132), served as study locations for

the final selection of the 24 study clusters consisting of multiple desas. Organized bed net

153

campaigns were recently introduced with the last mass distribution occurring in February-March

154

2018 across the study area. A mass distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) occurred

155

in October-December 2014 in both districts (Olyset Net® (Olyset Net®, permethrin 2.0% w/w)

156

with a reported > 95% coverage of households provided 1-4 nets each. A second round of LLIN

157

mass distribution occurred February-March 2018 (PermaNet® 3.0, deltamethrin 180mg/m2 +

158

PBO synergist). The last round of focal IRS occurred in 2003 using a pyrethroid-based product.

159

The malaria prevalence based on microscopically diagnosed parasitemia drawn from a random

160

sample of 50% of residents present in 13 villages conducted in 2015, 10 months before the

161

intervention trial, averaged 15.5% (2.5% to 37.3%) (Table 1).

162

Although very little detail is known about the malaria vector distribution and bionomics

163

in this study area,28 an earlier (August 2007) entomologic survey documented 13 species of

164

anophelines occurring in West Sumba district: Anopheles aconitus (Dönitz), Anopheles annularis

165

Van der Wulp, Anopheles barbirostris s.l. (Satoto), Anopheles flavirostris (Ludlow), Anopheles

166

hyrcanus group (Reid), Anopheles indefinitus (Ludlow), Anopheles kochi (Dönitz), Anopheles

167

leucosphyrus group (Reid), Anopheles maculatus Theobald, Anopheles subpictus s.l. Grassi,

168

Anopheles sundaicus s.l. (Dusfour et al.), Anopheles tessellatus Theobald, and Anopheles vagus

169

Dönitz.29 These species vary spatially in relative abundance associated with presence of their

170

preferred aquatic larval habitats ranging from coastal brackish and freshwater marshes and

171

ponds, seasonally productive rice paddies, to forested hillsides with perennial running streams

172

and small rivers. At the time of the survey, human-landing collections revealed An. subpictus and

173

An. vagus as the predominant species in the upland interior locations, and An. sundaicus as the

174

most common species attracted to human along the coastal plain. The majority of residents in

study villages work as small-holder agriculturalist pursuits, typically lacking public supplied

176

electricity or articulated water supply systems. Homes are predominately traditional designed,

177

large, thatched-roof structures raised ~1m above ground, averaging ~70 m3 in size (6 m length x

178

6 m width x 2 m in height) and constructed with gaping bamboo walls and flooring that offer

179

little protection from mosquito entry (Figure 2).

180
181

Trial design. The study was a randomized cluster, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial

182

with a total of 24 clusters divided into 12 clusters per intervention arm. The primary outcome of

183

the study was to demonstrate and quantify the protective efficacy (PE) of a spatial repellent

184

product in reducing the incidence of malaria infection in a human cohort. The null hypothesis

185

was that there is no difference in malaria incidence between intervention and control arms.

186

Clusters were selected based on housing type, focusing on traditional houses (with or without

187

thatch roofing) (Figure 2), mitigation of potential chemical dispersion 'spillover' effect (i.e.,

188

distance between nearest homes in different clusters ~500 m apart), and logistical considerations

189

(i.e., distance from field-based satellite laboratories). About fifty-four households were recruited

190

within each cluster based on human sample size requirements. Households from 13 villages were

191

stratified into 24 clusters before randomization: Gaura (pop. 2,831; houses 432), Kahale (pop.

192

3,904, houses 253), Karang Indah (pop. 1,169, houses 139), Manutoghi (pop. 1,067; houses 165),

193

Matakapore (pop. 2,805; houses 209), Panenggo Ede (pop. 1,271; houses 90), Rada Malando

(pop. 1,842; houses 133), Tana Mete (pop. 2,124; houses 213), Waikarara (pop. 2,709; houses

446), Wailangira (pop. 1,878; houses 226), Waimakaha (pop. 2,334; houses 211), Waimaringi

196

(pop. 2,598; houses 116), and Weetana (pop. 2,670; houses 275) (Figure 3).

Sample size. Previous malaria incidence rates collected in a portion of the study area in coastal

199

Kodi Subdistrict were used to estimate the likely malaria attack rate in the current study villages

200

at 0.3 infections/person-year.19 Sample size determination was based on the hazard rate

201

comparison in the proportional hazards regression model.30 The required number of first-time

202

infections was estimated at 417 to permit detection of a 30% protective effect by the spatial

203

repellent intervention compared to placebo with 80% power at the type-I error rate, assuming a

204

between-cluster coefficient of variation (CV) of 30% and a baseline hazard rate of 0.3 per

205

person-year. With 12 clusters per treatment arm (active or placebo), with 2-month accrual and 22

206

months follow-up, and an estimated 20% loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) during intervention, a total

207

of 54 subjects per cluster was required (n=1,296). As entomology measures were used in

208

relationship analyses of PE rather than hypothesis testing, sample size was based on field

209

logistical capacity and not for statistical power.

210
211

Participants. The average number of children £5 years of age in each cluster was 68 (57-79).

212

From individual households in study clusters, one child, aged ³6 months - £5 years at time of

213

recruitment, were provided the opportunity to enroll as subjects in the study. Following informed

214

consent, medical screening consisted of physical examination by a study physician and a

215

qualitative NADPH spot test for G6PD deficiency (Trinity Biotech qualitative G6PD assayTM,

216

ref 345-UV, Trinity Biotech, St. Louis, MO).31 Additional to being G6PD normal status,

217

eligibility requirements included a bodyweight ³ 40 kg, hemoglobin > 5mg/dL (Hb201+,

221

travel during the study period.

222
223

Intervention. Immediately after completion of radical cure, intervention was simultaneously

224

initiated in all subject households and non-subject households that consented to receive

225

intervention. The spatial repellent intervention is a transfluthrin-based passive emanator

226

produced by S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc (SCJ) designed to release a volatile chemical into the air

227

and prevent human–vector contact by disrupting normal behavior of mosquitoes within the

228

treated space. The indoor placement of the intervention product was designed with the objective

229

to measure PE under indoor use conditions. Transfluthrin is a registered compound commonly

230

found in commercially available mosquito coils globally based on WHO specifications.33 The

231

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently approved transfluthrin products for

232

indoor use with the USA.34 Emanators (active and placebo) of identical packaging and color

233

were distributed by study personnel every 2 weeks at the individual household application rate of

234

2 units / 9m2 according to SCJ specifications. There was a median of 1 room (range 1,9) and 10

235

emanators (range 4,56) per household. Intervention devices were positioned indoors by hanging

236

individual emanators on two metal hooks specially attached to walls for this study. Each position

237

remained static throughout the study. The hooks facilitated stabilization of the interventions so

238

the chemical-treated surface was consistently exposed facing the interior space. Research staff

239

placed, removed and replaced emanators in households at set intervals and recorded attrition,

240

based on number of products removed from each structure during each replacement period, to

241

ascertain application rate for use in estimating cluster coverage. During the trial period, quality

242

control analysis was performed by Ross Laboratories, India on unused (in storage) emanators to

Randomization, allocation and blinding. Clusters were allocated to receive either active or

249

placebo treatment using a random number generator (https://www.random.org). The cluster

250

allocation code was made available from the intervention manufacturer to the Data Safety

251

Monitoring Board (DSMB) for use in safety assessments. The site database manager assigned a

252

unique identification number to each household (HIN) and the site intervention administrator

253

coordinated distribution of blinded active or placebo to enrolled households within each cluster

254

corresponding to the pre-labeled package code. Unblinded assignments were shared with a site

255

administrator in a sealed envelope placed in a secure location within the managing center of the

256

research project (Jakarta) for purposes of emergency unblinding related to adverse and serious

257

adverse events. Thus, the investigators, research team, study subjects, and residents were blinded

and piperaquine, respectively, once daily for 3 days. Primaquine (PT, Pharos Tbk, Semarang,

267

Indonesia) 0.25 mg/kg body weight was prescribed for the 14 days immediately before

268

implementing intervention. The DHA-P combination is currently the first-line antimalarial drug

269

for uncomplicated malaria treatment in Indonesia. All subjects were examined for Plasmodium

270

spp. infection by expert microscopy, and later confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

271

from matched filter paper blood spot samples.35 New malaria infections among the participants

272

were monitored every 4 weeks using microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films

273

according to WHO guidelines based on a minimum of 200 high magnification (1000x oil-

274

immersion) thick blood film fields.36 Two certified expert microscopists independently (blinded)

275

examined slides on-site at project-dedicated field laboratories. PCR detection of parasite DNA

276

was conducted at the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology (EIMB) central laboratory in

277

Jakarta for all four Plasmodium species.35 A blood sample was defined as malaria ‘positive’ for

278

inclusion in incidence analyses if meeting criteria of having two diagnostic outcomes indicating

279

presence of parasite (e.g., 2x microscopy; 1x microscopy + 1x PCR; or 2x PCR). All positive

280

and 10% randomly selected negative samples diagnosed at EIMB were re-tested at the

281

University of Notre Dame. Discordant microscopy and PCR results required reexamination of

282

both initial findings. Participants found malaria infected at point-of-care were immediately

283

treated with DHA-P and were removed from contributing further to person-time at risk of first-

284

time infection; however, they remained in the study to monitor cumulative incidence for analyses

285

of overall (total new) infections and estimate number of cases averted.

end of follow-up period in a subset of 12 clusters. Clusters for entomological sampling were

290

selected based on exhibiting highest HLC densities during baseline sampling, along with

291

existence of mosquito larval habitats. The 12 clusters were hierarchically stratified on criteria of

292

baseline human landing catch then blindly allocated to treatment arm to ensure a balanced

293

recruitment (6 clusters in each treatment group). Four neighboring sentinel houses within each of

294

the 12 clusters were randomly selected for mosquito collections (n=48). Collections were

295

conducted at sentinel houses for 1 night every 2 weeks from paired active/placebo clusters (e.g.,

296

3 pairs on Monday night and 3 pairs on Wednesday night) during intervention. Teams of two

297

collectors were assigned per house, one positioned indoors near the center of the house and one

298

located outside on the house verandah, approximately 1 m from the exterior wall. Collectors

299

removed all mosquitoes landing on their exposed lower legs using a mouth aspirator. Collections

300

were conducted from 1800 to 0600 h for 50 min every hour. Paired collectors rotated between

301

indoor and outdoor positions each hour. Samples were placed into individual holding containers

302

labeled by collection hour, unique house code (linked to blinded treatment code), and collection

303

location (indoor or outside). Captured mosquitoes were immediately killed by ether-soaked

304

cotton pads in the field and initially identified to species (or species complex) using

305

morphological characters.37 All specimens were transported to an on-site base laboratory upon

306

completion of the 12 h collection and a random sample of representative anopheline species (up

307

to 20% per cluster per indoor/outdoor location and hour of collection) were dissected for parity

308

and scored as either gravid/parous or nulliparous.38 Partial (head-thorax for those dissected for

309

parity) or whole anopheline specimens were placed singly into individual Eppendorf® 1.5ml

310

vials and stored over silica gel desiccant until further processing at EIMB, Jakarta, for detection

311

of malaria sporozoites and molecular-based species identification, where applicable.39, 40

Mosquito samples were evaluated for Plasmodium species infection using polymerase chain

313

reaction (PCR) methodologies to derive corresponding malaria sporozoite infection rates by

314

parasite and vector species.41 Together with time-adjusted HLC densities (anophelines/person-

315

night), matched sporozoite rates were used to derive the entomological inoculation rates (EIRs)

316

for each treatment arm.42 Anopheline species identification was verified at the University of

317

performed on F0 mixed anopheline species collected as immatures in 13 of the 24 study clusters

324

from across 23 habitat locations during baseline, intervention and 6-mo post-intervention period

325

(ending Oct 2018). Assays were conducted using non-bloodfed, 3-5 day old females according to

326

established guidelines.43, 44 After each test period, all chemical and control specimens were

327

stored individually over silica gel for analysis at EIMB to confirm species identification and for

Data management and verification. Data collection was designed around a tablet-based survey

339

platform linked to a custom-built database and web portal. CommCare (Dimagi Inc, MA, USA)

340

was selected as the frontend form application, providing critical capabilities, including: a parent-

341

child case structure, the ability to store forms when offline, update form versions after

342

deployment, build forms with complex logic in a web browser, and export form data to other

343

tools. Data was cleaned according to rules specified in the study protocol to ensure data

344

integrity. Study data related to participating subjects and households, intervention

345

(placement/replacement activity), mosquitoes collected, and lab analyses was cross-checked,

346

identifying missing, incomplete, or suspect data submissions. These data were relayed to the site

347

data manager to be resubmitted or corrected. Once data correction was complete, data was

Outcomes and statistical methods (S1. Statistical Analyses Plan). The primary endpoint for

351

estimating the protective efficacy (PE) of the spatial repellent intervention was malaria incidence

352

(time to first infection) among study participants in each of the 24 clusters. All participants, living

353

in separate households, received a directly observed, presumptive radical cure over a 14-day period

354

to clear them of any standing (patent, sub-patent, or latent) malaria infections. Subsequent

355

biweekly blood film examinations were conducted from subjects reporting fever within the

356

previous 48 hours (active case detection) with routine screening for malaria infection in all subjects

357

(passive case detection) occurring every 4 weeks for the duration of the study. Study participants

were excluded from analyses when lacking a blood sample during the intervention period or when

359

a household might have contributed more than two subjects. In the latter case, this occurred (rarely)

360

when there was loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) on the first recruited subject and a second subject was

361

recruited as a replacement; only the subject with a longer follow-up period was used based on per-

362

protocol allowing only one subject per household.

363

The primary hypothesis on PE against first-time malaria infection was tested by comparing

364

the hazard rates of the first-time malaria infection between active and placebo (blank) intervention.

365

The complementary log-log (cloglog) regression model log (− log'1 − 𝜃*+, -) = 𝛽1, + 𝒙,*+, 𝛽 +

366

𝑧* was.45-48 𝜃*+, is the discrete time hazard rate of subject 𝑗 in cluster I at time t, 𝒙*+, contains visit

367

(as a categorical predictor), the individual-level (age, gender), household-level (number of doors,

368

open eaves Y or N, wall type), and cluster-level (baseline incidence rate, cluster population size,

369

intervention group) covariates, and 𝑧* ~ 𝑁(0, 𝜎 ; ) is the cluster-level random effect. PE was

370

estimated by ((1 − exp'𝛽? -)100% with a 90% confidence interval (CI) based on the Wald test,

371

where 𝛽? is the estimated regression coefficient associated with the intervention group, and exp(βA)

372

is the estimated hazard ratio (HR) between active and placebo. The null hypothesis that PE is 0

373

was tested by the Wald’s test 𝑧 = 𝛽? /𝑠,, where 𝑠 is the estimated standard error of βA. It was

374

concluded that active intervention reduces the first-time malaria hazard rate compared to placebo

375

if 𝑧 < 𝑧1.1F = −1.645; otherwise, the study would not have sufficient evidence to suggest that

376

active intervention reduces the first-time malaria hazard rate compared to placebo at a one-sided

377

significance level of 5%. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves on time to first infection per cluster was

378

provided for the active and placebo arms, respectively.

of the first-time malaria infection except that the above cloglog model has additional term 𝑧+(*) ,

382

which is the random effect at the individual level to account for the dependence among multiple

383

malaria infections per individual. The same set of analyses as described above were performed in

384

a subgroup analysis in clusters with non-zero baseline incidence rates and those clusters with

385

entomology data.

386

The effects of active intervention on the secondary entomological endpoints were

387

estimated using a negative binomial regression model, if applicable. Specifically, the anopheline

388

landing rate (surrogate ‘bite’ based on HLC and indicator of human-vector contact) is defined as

389

the number of mosquitos captured during a 12-hr evening interval (1800-0600). The covariates in

390

the model include the fixed effects of intervention group, the interaction between treatment and

391

location of collection (inside or outside), visit (as categorical), baseline incidence rate, baseline

392

vector count, cluster population, and random effects for household nested within cluster and for

393

cluster. The percentage change in human landing rate by intervention was estimated from the

394

model. The frequencies and percentages of captured anophelines were also summarized by species.

395

The set of covariates in the model for analyzing the parity rate are similar to the landing rate

396

model, with an additional offset term for the daily landing rate. Due to data sparsity for the

397

sporozoite positivity rate (> 99% of tested mosquitos were uninfected), no model-based analysis

398

was performed and only summary statistics are provided. The entomological inoculation rate

399

(EIR) is defined as the number of malaria infective mosquito bites a person receives per a unit time

400

(typically annually) and calculated as EIR = sporozoite positivity rate × human biting rate. The

401

observed data sparsity experienced with low sporozoite positivity also impacts the EIR results, and

402

thus only summary statistics are provided for EIR.

Trial outcomes show baseline covariates regarding subject, house construction,

population and baseline malaria incidence between the active and placebo arms were balanced at

410

the individual-, household-, and cluster-level in the all 24 cluster analyses (Table 2). The

411

intervention coverage rate, defined as the proportion of actually placed emanators over the total

412

number required per household, ranged from 82.2% to 98.6% by cluster over the entire

413

intervention period, with a mean application rate of 93.2% and 92.3% for the active and placebo

414

arms, respectively. The percent of LLIN usage per household during the trial, defined as

415

responding ‘Yes’ to the question: “Did you use a bed net last night?", ranged from 14.6% to

416

99.8% in clusters that received active intervention and 17.4% to 99.8% in clusters that received

417

placebo (S2. LLIN Usage).

418

There were 134 first-time infections among 665 subjects in active intervention

households and 164 first-time infections in 667 subjects in placebo-control households, with a

420

27.7% decrease in the first-time malaria hazard risk using active compared with placebo (90%

CI: -21.3%, 56.9%) (Table 3). The 27.7% PE was not statistically significant at the 5% one-

427

A total of 164 first-time malaria infections occurred during approximately 1032 person-

428

years at risk in study participants whose households were given placebo, with a calculated

429

incidence density of 0.159 infections/person-year (Table 3, Figure 5).49 In contrast, 134 total

430

malaria attacks occurred in transfluthrin-active households with approximately 1079 person-

431

years at risk resulting in a calculated 0.124 infections/person-year. A cumulative 439 malaria

432

infections (first-time and subsequent) during approximately 1216 person-years at risk in

433

participants with households provided placebo, produced an incidence density of 0.361

434

infections/person-year. Contrastingly, 253 total (accumulative) malaria attacks occurred among

435

participants living in active intervention households with approximately 1216 person-years at

436

risk equaling 0.209 infections/person-year (Table 3).

438

Subgroup analyses of protective effect against malaria infection among non-zero incidence

and entomology clusters (not pre-planned).

440

Among the 24 clusters, there were five clusters with zero baseline incidence having had

zero to very low incidence rates during intervention. The first subgroup analysis used the 19

442

clusters with non-zero incidence rate as the remaining five clusters may have been excluded from

443

the intervention if baseline analysis had been performed before randomization. Excluding these

444

five clusters, the estimated PE for overall (total new) infections in the remaining subgroup of 19

445

clusters with non-zero baseline incidence rates was 40.9% (90% CI: 8.61, 61.8%) resulting in a

446

There was a numerical reduction in indoor and outdoor landing density from collections

472

performed in households provided active intervention (n= 3,883 and 4,373, respectively)

473

compared with placebo households (n= 4,897 and 4,834, respectively). The reduction in

474

anopheline attack rate on collectors positioned indoors and outdoors, at sentinel households with

475

active intervention compared with placebo houses was not statistically significant: 16.4% (95%

476

CI = -75.2%, 182.7%; p = 0.774) and 11.3% (95% CI = -73.7%, 199.4%; p =0.847), respectively

477

(Table 4).

479

Sporozoite positivity rate and Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR). A total of 11,928 and

480

17,986 anopheline samples from baseline and intervention follow-up periods, respectively, were

481

processed for malaria sporozoites. The frequency of sporozoite positive anophelines is provided

482

in Table 5. Only P. falciparum and P. vivax infections were detected in captured mosquitoes.

483

During baseline and intervention period, the sporozoite rate was less than 0.5% for both

484

treatment and placebo arms. Data sparsity regarding comparison of sporozoite rates precluded

485

inferential statistical analyses. The EIR was <1 bite per year in both treatment arms during

497

Insecticide susceptibility. A total of 5,091 adult female anophelines (chemical and control

498

bioassays) were evaluated for susceptibility: 700 samples during baseline, 1,805 during

499

intervention and 2,586 post-intervention. Anopheles vagus was the most widely distributed and

500

tested anopheline (56%), followed by An. sundaicus (12.6%) and An. subpictus, An. barbirostris,

501

An. kochi, An. aconitus, An. maculatus, and An. tessellatus (proportionally, all < 10%). In the

502

CDC bottle bioassay, baseline, intervention and post-intervention tests using permethrin

503

(21.5ng/ml) showed 100% knockdown between 15-30 min exposure and within the

504

recommended diagnostic time. In the WHO tube bioassay with rare exception, there was 100%

505

24hr mortality to permethrin 0.75% following 60 min exposure. Based on the assumption of

506

predominately pyrethroid-susceptible wild populations of Anopheles species present in trial sites,

507

there was no conclusive evidence of the development of phenotypic resistance to pyrethroid class

508

chemicals between pre-and post-intervention periods. Interestingly, in several clusters during the

509

post-intervention phase, there were indications of reduced permethrin susceptibility (WHO

510

bioassay) in a few An. barbirostris populations to permethrin. Follow-up investigations provided

511

inconsistent results, thus confirmation that these focal populations showed low levels of

512

resistance could not be verified. The determination of presence or absence of target-site

513

mechanisms for resistance will be reported separately.

Adverse Events (AE) and Severe Adverse Events (SAE).

518

Using government clinic health records, a total of 523 AEs were reported from non-participants

519

while 144 AEs were reported from the intervention study cohort captured by the study team. Of

520

subject AEs, 52 were reported from participants in the active intervention arm and 92 from

521

placebo clusters. General respiratory complaints were most common for all reported AEs,

522

followed by general fever. There were 6 total SAEs reported in the overall study cohort during

523

follow-up: one death due to suspected brain infection; one death from respiratory infection; one

524

death from malaria with concomitant bacterial or viral infection; one death by drowning, and two

525

deaths of unknown cause.

Intervention Quality Control.

528

A total of 180 unused emanator samples were analyzed in 2017. Samples were taken from 12

529

different active and placebo clusters with manufacturing dates ranging from April to November

530

2016 (15mo to 8mo-old samples). All sampled placebo interventions (n = 48) were found to be

531

absent for transfluthrin. The average transfluthrin quantity from all sampled active emanators (n

532

= 132) was 54.3 mg, which was within the specification range (55.0 mg ± 2.75 mg).

DISCUSSION

535

Malaria remains a significant global public health burden despite recent progress in reducing

536

transmission rates.50 The primary objective of this large-scale RCT conducted on Sumba Island,

537

Indonesia was to demonstrate and quantify the protective efficacy (PE) of a passive emanating

538

spatial repellent intervention (transfluthrin-treated), for reducing malaria incidence

539

(transmission) in humans. Such epidemiological evidence of health impact is a fundamental

requirement in the critical path of development of new vector control intervention classes being

541

assessed by the WHO VCAG.16 Sumba Island, Indonesia was selected as the study site based on

542

WHO VCAG requirements of assessing evidence from varied endemic settings where spatial

543

repellents are intended to be implemented if/when a policy recommendation is endorsed. In

544

addition, Sumba does not currently conduct routine IRS and LLINs were only recently

545

distributed.

546

The primary per-protocol analyses provide an estimate of 27% PE against malaria

547

infection, which is near the efficacy of 30% selected in the power calculations. This effect,

548

however, was not statistically significant with confidence intervals that include zero. There were

549

298 first-time infections, in contrast to an expected number of at least 417 assumed in the sample

550

size calculations, thus resulting on the trial being underpowered. The demonstration of spatial

551

repellency PE (66%) against total new infections in the subset of 12 clusters used for

552

entomological measures, which had approximately 4 folds greater malaria infection incidence

553

during intervention, indicates health impact where risk of malaria infection was greatest (i.e.,

554

locations with highest vector landing densities). Outcomes reported here are promising for

555

malaria control, despite the study being unable to demonstrate clear, statistically protective

556

efficacy on primary analysis, with data anticipated to be included in meta-analyses with other

557

clinical trials evaluating spatial repellents.

558

This study highlights three primary challenges for consideration in future spatial repellent

559

trials as well for new vector control intervention classes more broadly: 1) firstly, having

560

‘adaptive’ study designs, especially for evaluation of interventions in low to moderate malaria

561

transmission settings and/or settings with inherently large cluster-to-cluster variance on

562

transmission intensity; 2) defining and identification of the ‘key’ entomological correlates of

563

protection; and 3) ensuring reliability and feasibility in AE/SAE reporting for accurate safety

564

assessment. Regarding adaptive study designs, our assumptions for power and sample size

565

calculations were based on a previous proof-of-concept study that took place in an entirely

566

coastal location but was spatially very near (bordering) the current study area.19 The study

567

villages, both coastal and further inland, were selected with the assumption that all clusters

568

delineated from these villages would experience similar levels of malaria transmission during the

569

intervention period; however, this was not the case during the trial. As in all epidemiological

570

trials, underlying assumptions of incidence used for power and sample size calculations can vary

571

from actual incidence during intervention follow-up. Baseline data analyses indicated zero-

572

incidence for five of the 24 selected study clusters with a 5-folds higher between-cluster

573

variability than assumed in the original sample size calculation. The five clusters with zero

574

baseline incidence (two allocated to receive active and three allocated to receive placebo) also

575

had either zero or low incidence rates during intervention and ranked in the top 8 among the 24

576

clusters in terms of lowest in intervention incidence (data not shown).

577

In retrospect, a pre-planned interim and final analysis of the baseline data would have

578

allowed for consideration in adjustment of the study design by filtering out the zero-incidence

579

clusters, or increasing the study duration (time of follow-up), the number of subjects recruited

580

per cluster, or the number of clusters to better satisfy requirements of statistical power and

581

capture the necessary number of outcome events (infections). However, baseline incidence was

582

measured only for verifying hierarchical stratification and use as a covariate in statistical

583

analyses of PE. This therefore, resulted in: 1) the original sample size not accommodating for

584

interim and final analyses of baseline data; 2) timelines of grant period not being projected and

585

assured to include lag-time for baseline data analyses and outcome assessment; and perhaps most

25

586

importantly 3) baseline incidence analyses not being explored early to determine variations in

587

sample size /cluster number adjustments required to achieve sufficient study power and

588

subsequent study site viability.

589

Given the updated baseline incidence rate of 0.131 per person-year and 97.1% CV, to

590

maintain 80% power with the originally assumed 30% PE, 100 clusters per arm with 144

591

households (HHs; i.e. subjects) would have been required to be recruited to collect 5,550 first-

592

time malaria events – an unmanageable scale that could not have been supported due to

593

geographical, logistical and funding constraints. Moreover, increasing the follow-up time to

594

collect more first-time malaria events would have neither counterbalanced the large variability

595

nor the longer duration required to collect the additional events due to the seasonally-influenced

596

low to moderate malaria transmission among clusters. For this reason, when planning future

597

trials in low or moderate endemic settings, investigators should consider including a greater

598

number of clusters per arm and/or building into the statistical analyses plan an interim and final

599

analyses of baseline incidence with pre-determined study design adaptations, to include down-

600

selection of clusters with predetermined incidence thresholds. This may become most relevant

601

when considering proof of efficacy of an intervention in low transmission settings as a

602

component for malaria elimination goals. Early exercises of the impact of a lower than assumed

603

incidence (or greater CV) during study planning should be explored amongst investigators,

604

industry and funding partners to ensure that the study area context, intervention manufacturing,

605

program period and/or funding can sufficiently meet the demands of power requirements if

606

adjustments are to be made once the study begins. Stakeholders should also discuss supporting

607

and adopting adaptive designs thereby allow decision-making after planned interim analysis of

608

intervention data, to either stop the trial for futility or to continue the trial with adjusted design

609

parameters, such as sample size.51, 52 Perhaps just as important in the context of vector control,

610

although RCTs are rated as high-quality evidence,53 considerations to RCT alternatives are

611

prudent in the trial planning phase as these may offer assurances of adequate data rigor while

612

balancing cost and time constraints of traditional RCTs.54, 55 Alternative study designs include

613

large observational studies for detecting population-level effects using analytical cross-sectional

614

studies, or operational program-based evidence; the latter perhaps especially for interventions

615

containing an existing registered chemical active ingredient (i.e., meets human safety thresholds)

616

and where the intervention is implemented in pilot trials and impact monitored through case

617

reports, as compared to a contemporaneous control group.55

618

Albeit the study was not powered for entomology, the inclusion of entomological

619

endpoints in the Sumba RCT was, in part, to help understand and validate the intervention’s

620

mode of action for the VCAG claim of a health impact through a reduction in human-vector

621

contact. Spatial repellent chemicals may cause initial knockdown and mortality by exposure to

622

toxic doses at close range to the active ingredient, or a delayed kill through behavioral avoidance

623

response (i.e., blood-feeding inhibition), through exposure to sub-lethal doses at distances further

624

away from the stimulus source. Therefore, entomological measurements for detecting reductions

625

in human-landing density in clusters with active intervention, and a possible change in

626

anopheline age structure (parity rate) indicating older populations not surviving as long as in

627

placebo areas, was built into this study. Additionally, a reduction in sporozoite infection rates,

628

because of lower blood feeding success, and/or an inability to survive the required time interval

629

(parasite incubation period) to become infective (transmissible) from a vector to a host, represent

630

other endpoint measures of repellency impact. A causal relationship with one, several or all, of

631

these endpoints would allow future trials evaluating non-inferiority of a ‘second-in-class’ spatial

repellent to integrate entomological measures only to predict PE and provide assurances of

633

meeting minimum thresholds of acceptance for public health use.

634

Sporozoite positivity rates and EIR estimates from the current trial were low, with a total

635

of 42 of 11,650 (0.36%) anophelines tested during baseline (10mo) and 19 of 17,971 (0.11%)

636

found infected during intervention (24mo). These findings are not unusual or unexpected in low

637

to moderate malaria transmission settings.28 As example, the previous Sumba study (using

638

metofluthrin coils) reported just 15 out of 1,825 (0.82%) HLC anopheline samples sporozoite

639

infected.19 The challenges for assessing sporozoite infectivity and using EIR as a measure of

640

intervention effect in such settings should be factored into study pre-planning to carefully

641

balance cost of sample processing with potential useful information gained.

642

These study findings report a 16.4% numerical reduction in indoor-landing mosquitoes

643

exposed to active treatment compared to placebo-control. Just as important was an observed

644

numerical reduction (11%) on outdoor-landing collections on the exposed verandah of sentinel

645

houses, as Sumba residents often sleep on the verandah without the protection of a bed net. It is

646

noted, however, that both indoor and outdoor HLC outcomes showed wide CIs that overlap zero,

647

making results inconclusive. A previous proof-of-concept study on Sumba that evaluated a

648

metofluthrin-active coil resulted in a significant 32% reduction in An. sundaicus indoor landing

649

rates as compared to a blank-coil control;19 The minimal reduction in the human landing rate in

650

the current RCT may be the result of species-specific effects by active ingredient (i.e.,

651

metofluthrin vs. transfluthrin) but differences in HLC outcomes of the two studies on Sumba

652

should not be interpreted as the transfluthrin intervention being less efficacious than a coil. The

653

greater complexity of anopheline diversity may likely have contributed to the inconclusive HLC

654

outcomes based on aggregated anopheline data. It is expected similar results may occur in future

655

trials that are conducted in settings with diverse vector populations and/or as cluster size

656

increases thereby increasing the probability of greater habitat diversity.

657

Specifically, the previous Sumba study was smaller in scale and An. sundaicus was the

658

overwhelmingly predominate human-feeding anopheline collected; whereas in the current study

659

this species was relatively uncommon during the intervention trial. The range of ecologies

660

(coastal plains to upland forested hills) varied greatly across the 12 clusters used for entomology

661

collections in this trial compared to that of the earlier Sumba study where collections were

662

confined to only 4 adjoining clusters having similar coastal environments. This spatial variability

663

in ecology contributed to a broader range of species diversity. We report 19 species/group

664

species identified), each species with different bionomic and behavioral characteristics (e.g.,

665

biting habits, host preferences). Perhaps most important, the efficacy of an intervention is related

666

to epidemiological outcomes (reduced risk of infection); HLC outcomes reported from the

667

current study were inconclusive, but nevertheless showed impact against malaria.

668

Insecticide susceptibility monitoring was integrated into the study to characterize the

669

wild-type anopheline populations to estimate PE against resistant vector populations, if

670

resistance was expressed, and monitor changes in susceptibility due to continuous exposure to

671

transfluthrin. Our data indicates that continual use of transfluthrin as a spatial repellent during a

672

consecutive 24-mo period did not result in a change in phenotypic response to permethrin.

673

Although we are confident in the findings presented, there were limitations in sampling from

674

multiple sites and handling numerous species during pre-, within, and post-intervention periods.

675

This may have compromised the study’s ability to obtain a more robust and definitive profile of

676

susceptibility background and detection of any shift in phenotypic (and molecular) frequencies.

The third ‘lesson-learned’ from the current study relates to AE and SAE monitoring.

678

Reports of intervention safety in this study should take into account possible limitations of the

679

data collection. The DSMB was provided with clinic attendance data from January 2015 to

680

December 2018, for upper respiratory infection (URI), pneumonia, and malaria, as classified by

681

month, health center, and village within health center coverage. Although not gathered as part of

682

the study, the DSMB was keenly interested in these data because of the surprisingly low number

683

of illnesses/deaths reported from the study population during the 24-month intervention period.

684

For some periods, particularly for malaria infection, the case data were missing or the health

685

center totals were not available at the village level. Of the 13 villages represented in the dataset,

686

from which study clusters were formed, all but four comprised clusters (or parts of clusters) from

687

both study intervention arms (i.e., allocated active or placebo); therefore, it was not possible to

688

infer the allocation status of the corresponding cases. For this reason, the DSMB was unable to

689

make a reliable assessment of any possible association between active intervention and clinic

690

attendance for those reported health conditions. The respiratory illnesses in the clinic data are

691

more reflective of the magnitude of numbers of cases one would expect from this population;

692

however, the DSMB was again unable to parse them into test and control clusters due to reasons

693

stated above, and therefore the data was of little use for monitoring purposes. The number of

694

SAEs reported, a total of six, is well below the expected in a study population of this size. The

695

WHO estimates the crude death rate in Indonesia to be approximately 6.2 per thousand per

696

year.56 Based on this, for a population of 1,296 children enrolled (protocol sample size), the

697

probability of having zero deaths in a year is less than one in 1,000. Although open

698

commemoration of deaths is commonly practiced in the study area, it seems more likely deaths

699

were not completely reported/recorded as SAEs.

Syafruddin et al., Spatial repellent RCT, Sumba_RTR_30Oct2019
700

Overall, the point to apply for future spatial repellent trials (and perhaps other trials of

701

new vector control interventions) is to improve the mechanism for capturing and communicating

702

AEs and SAEs before the initiation of the study to better ensure reliable reporting and regular

703

monitoring for unusual numbers of complaints. If these studies are regarded as a clinical trial

704

with a placebo arm that requires comparative AE and SAE data, the scale could cause failure in

705

safety assessment simply on the mass of data, however imperfectly collected. Any safety signal

706

detected would most likely be due to bias in reporting and/or collection bias and unrelated with

707

the investigational intervention. Trials evaluating a spatial repellent intervention with a registered

708

active ingredient (i.e., a chemical meeting regulatory approvals for acceptable levels of human

709

risk) such as transfluthrin, could focus on a small number of complaints that might be expected

710

due to inhalation (i.e., volatilization) and develop a monitoring scheme that collects consistent

711

data across the study population. Clinic-based complaints of respiratory illness such as

712

pneumonia and asthma might be possible, but the variability in their method of collection (clinic

713

or survey) will likely be highly dependent on study site infrastructure.

714

In conclusion, while more evidence will be required to determine whether spatial

715

repellents can serve as a viable malaria control intervention, both the primary and secondary

716

results of this Sumba Island trial have generated valuable data and observations that can

717

contribute to the overall assessment and improvement of testing protocols of a spatial repellent

718

intervention class. The VCAG has recommended that data from at least one additional trial

719

evaluating the spatial repellent be generated,57 and once available, the panel will be able to assess

720

the available evidence for judging public health value. If the crude estimate of PE shown here,

721

near 30%, is replicated in future statistically robust cluster-randomized trials, the intervention

722

prototype evaluated in this RCT would approximate the benefit associated with LLINs.58 Perhaps

just as important, the difference in the overall (total new) infection rate between transfluthrin-

724

active and placebo-control, i.e., the number of cases averted, indicates 361 expected cases per

725

1000 persons per year (0.361*1000*1) without the spatial repellent and 152 less cases expected

726

when using the active intervention ((0.361-0.209)*1000*1). The cost-savings of averting these

727

152 less cases per 1000 person-years is an important consideration for health-systems

728

strengthening. These results have encouraged further and substantial investment to validate

729

spatial repellent efficacy through larger RCTs, including an investigation of possible vector

730

diversionary effects on human health (i.e., greater than expected malaria incidence in households

731

near intervention not receiving active product), and evaluation of the optimal delivery systems

732

for humanitarian assistance use-case scenarios.59
