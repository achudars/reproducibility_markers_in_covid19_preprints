Abstract
High pre-treatment values of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are strongly associated with
poorer survival outcomes in cancer patients. Here, we assess heterogeneity in the magnitude of this
association and the prognostic potential of the NLR between patient subgroups. We conducted a
random effects meta-analysis of 228 published studies (N=75,555 patients) relating NLR with overall
survival across 18 cancer types. Cochran's Q test and Higgins I2 statistic were used to assess study
heterogeneity. Pooled hazard ratios were compared between groups of studies classified by cancer
type, geographic region, therapy type, and cut-off for high NLR to identify study-level characteristics
associated with increased prognostic potential of the NLR. Pooled hazard ratios are highest in studies
of melanoma and breast cancer and lowest in studies of brain cancer and lung cancer. Radiation as
primary treatment also demonstrates a large pooled effect size as compared to other therapies. The
NLR has greater prognostic value in certain cancer types and therapeutic regimens. Efforts are
needed to comprehensively examine populations in which NLR has maximum prognostic power.
Clinically meaningful thresholds for risk stratification should be identified within these patient
subgroups to permit prospective validation of the prognostic potential of the NLR.

1. Introduction
Inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of cancer1-4, and there is a strong interest
in identifying easily obtainable and robust metrics of the systemic inflammatory status of cancer
patients for risk stratification at diagnosis. Immune cell components of the complete blood count
(CBC) offer an easily accessible measure of inflammation as the CBC is often collected as part of
standard clinical care at minimal cost and inconvenience to the patient.
One marker of systemic inflammation available from the CBC is the neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio (NLR), the quotient of the absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts5-8. Neutrophilia is a
common feature of cancer-associated chronic inflammation, and both tumor-promoting and immunesuppressive roles of neutrophil subpopulations have been documented9-13. In addition to producing
cytokines associated with tumor progression, the innate neutrophilic response can suppress the
activity of cytotoxic T cells and in turn promote metastasis14,15. Neutrophilia is commonly
accompanied by relative lymphocytopenia, representing a significant decline in the cell-mediated
adaptive immune response. The NLR captures the balance between the detrimental effects of
neutrophilia and the beneficial effects of lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immunity16.
Both systemic neutrophilia and lymphopenia are associated with reduced survival in cancer
patients17-20. Many previous studies have examined the prognostic value of pre-treatment NLR5,6, and
strong associations have consistently been demonstrated between high NLR and poor patient
outcomes across many cancer types. Despite this, heterogeneity in the strength of association
between NLR and overall survival has been observed6. Templeton et al. identified significant
differences in pooled hazard ratios for association between high NLR and overall survival among 8
cancer types and between metastatic versus non-metastatic disease6, suggesting the prognostic
potential of the NLR may be limited to specific patient subgroups.
Based on the rapid growth of existing literature in recent years, we conducted an updated
meta-analysis including 228 studies (N=75,555 patients) relating NLR with overall survival in 18

cancer types. We quantify between-study heterogeneity and compare pooled hazard ratios by cancer
type, as well as by region of study, therapy type, and cut-off for high NLR. We discuss publication
bias and other potential sources of heterogeneity in the reported literature, and address the
implications of this heterogeneity for translation of the NLR for clinical application.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Data sources & extraction
The methods and results of the meta-analysis are reported in accordance with the PRISMA
guidelines21. An electronic search of PubMed (including Medline 1974 to 1996) was conducted1 from
inception to the end of 2017. Search terms included “neutrophil” “lymphocyte”, “ratio” and “NLR”, as
well as “neutrophil:lymphocyte” and “neutrophil/lymphocyte”; details of the search strategy can be
found in Supplementary Material S1a.
All titles identified by the search strategy were screened manually for association with
cancerous diseases. After exclusion of non-cancer-associated manuscripts, remaining abstracts were
screened for site-specific original research articles, which then proceeded to full text screening. The
primary criteria for inclusion were: a) evaluation of the prognostic potential of the NLR as measured in
peripheral blood, and b) availability of hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for overall
survival based on multivariable regression analysis. Only studies in which NLR was obtained prior to
the index treatment were included. We excluded studies that did not control for clinical and
demographic covariates in the analysis (N=9), as well as studies published in non-English journals
(N=28) and those in which NLR was reported as a continuous variable in multivariable analysis
(N=10). All duplicates were omitted, including publications in which there was any potential overlap
with patients in other included reports (Figure 1).

Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome of interest. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was
not assessed in the meta-analysis as only 6 cancer sites had multiple eligible manuscripts for
analysis, as compared to 24 cancer sites with OS. Name of first author, year of publication, journal,
region of study, number of patients included in analysis, age and sex distribution of patients, disease
site, disease subtype(s), primary treatment type(s), average pre-treatment NLR, cut-off defining “high”
NLR, hazard ratio for OS from multivariable analysis, and HR-associated 95% confidence intervals
were extracted from each manuscript.

in the final 228 studies for inclusion in the analysis. Exclusion criteria included: not associated with cancerous diseases;

potential overlap of study subjects; no English full-text version available; no overall survival endpoint; no adjusted hazard
ratio provided; NLR treated as continuous; NLR evaluated after initiation of treatment.

We identified cancer type of interest, chosen cut-off for high NLR, geographic region of study
recruitment, and primary therapy type as study-level variables that were available for all contributing

studies. Strata for cancer type (N=18) were defined for all cancers with 2 or more studies included in
the meta-analysis. Cancers represented by only one study (N=6) were pooled into an “Other”
category. NLR cut-points were <3.5 or ³3.5, where the threshold of 3.5 was selected based on the
average NLR cutoff across all studies included in the meta-analysis, weighted by number of
participants per study (mean = 3.45, standard deviation = 0.85). Strata for region of study recruitment
were Europe, North America, Asia, and Other. Categories for primary treatment included surgery,
radiotherapy, chemotherapy and ‘other treatments’.

2.2. Statistical analysis
We quantified the range of HRs presented in all 228 studies and formally assessed betweenstudy heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q test and Higgins I2 statistic. A p-value <0.05 in Cochran’s Q
test and I2>50% were considered sufficient evidence of heterogeneity. Meta-regression was
conducted to evaluate whether study-level variables, i.e. cancer type of interest, chosen cut-off for
high NLR, geographic region of study recruitment, and primary therapy type, altered the magnitude of
HRs.
We then assessed between-study heterogeneity within strata of each variable, for example,
within all studies relating to lung cancer or within all studies in which patients received radiation
therapy. If heterogeneity was observed, we used random effects models featuring restricted
maximum-likelihood estimation to calculate the weighted and pooled HRs for this stratum by generic
inverse variance. If no evidence of heterogeneity was found, fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) models
were used. The pooled HRs for each cancer type, region of study, therapy type, and for NLR cut-off
above and below 3.5 were compared to identify subgroups in which NLR demonstrated stronger
associations with survival (increased HR). Additionally, where heterogeneity in effect size was
observed within a specific cancer type, we conducted univariate meta-regression analysis to evaluate
the association between other study-level variables (region of study, therapy type, NLR cut-off) and
study effect size within cancer type subgroups.

We evaluated publication bias by funnel plot visualization and the Egger bias test. This
analysis was repeated for groups of studies stratified by region and by year of publication to evaluate
whether certain groups were more prone to this form of bias.
All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All
statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R version 3.3.2
(R core development team, Vienna, Austria).
3. Results
A total of 228 studies were included in the final meta-analysis, incorporating 75,555 individual
patients. More than one study was available for 18 different cancers; 6 additional cancers had only
one eligible study and thus were grouped together into the “Other” category. A summary of the
included studies by cancer type is provided in Table 1, and a comprehensive list of all included
studies can be found in Supplementary Material S1b. While individual-level data was not provided in
any of the included manuscripts, where summary statistics were available for the distribution of age,
sex or NLR within a study population, they have also been included in Supplementary Material S1b.
These summary statistics varied dramatically across the included studies: median study-level patient
ages ranged from 37 to 79, and median study-level patient NLR ranged from 1.7 to 7.3. Each study
also defined a cut-off for high NLR, and these study-level cut-offs also varied significantly from 1.7 to
7.5. Weighted averages of these summary statistics by cancer type can be found in Table 1.
The association between NLR and OS was significant in 195 studies (86%). The HRs for
baseline NLR and overall survival across all included studies ranged from 1.02 to above 8, with an
overall pooled HR of 1.75 [1.69-1.82]. Cochran’s Q test also indicated a high level of heterogeneity
across studies (Q = 3696, p<0.0001), as did Higgins I2 statistic (I2 = 94.5%).

Table 1. Summary of included studies. Table 1 presents a summary of studies (N=228) and patients (N=75,555)
included in the meta-analysis, grouped by cancer type. Summary statistics represent a weighted average value based on
the number of participants in each contributing study.

Forest plots of pooled HRs for strata of cancer type, region of study, therapy type, and NLR
cutoff can be found in Figure 2. There was considerable evidence of heterogeneity across each of
these four variables, with pCochran < 0.001 and I2 > 80% in all cases. For cancer type, the pooled HR
for the association between baseline NLR and OS was weakest in patients with brain cancer (HR =
1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.1) and strongest in patients with melanoma (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.28-5.51).
European studies (HR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.80-1.88), studies in which radiation was the primary
treatment modality (HR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.84-2.08), and studies in which the threshold for high NLR
was above the overall median of 3.5 (HR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.87-1.95) all exhibited a higher pooled
HR than other strata within their respective variables. Despite this, with the exception of brain cancer
(p=0.04), meta-regression analyses for the association between study effect size and cancer type,
region of study, therapy type and NLR cutoff resulted in non-significant p-values for all strata (not
shown).

Forest plots for all studies sorted by cancer type, and the models used for calculating these
weighted and pooled hazard ratios can be found in Supplementary Material S1c. Heterogeneity of
effect was observed within cancer types, including studies of bladder, breast, gynecologic, kidney,
liver, lung and pancreatic cancer, as well as melanoma and mesothelioma. Significant findings from
univariate meta-regression analysis within these cancer type subgroups are summarized in Figure 3.
The choice of cut-off for high NLR appeared to moderate effect size in studies of breast cancer, liver
cancer and melanoma. Therapy type was also significantly associated with effect size in pancreatic
cancer, and region of study was significantly associated with effect size in melanoma. All other metaregression associations were not significant (not shown).

within cancer type subgroups. Panel B shows an alternative representation of results shown in A (significant differences in
study effect size according to study-level variables within cancer type subgroups) via pooled HRs. Note that the one study
from the USA is also the only study with an NLR cut-off below 3.5, leading to identical meta-regression coefficients and
pooled HRs.

The funnel plot (Figure 4) and Egger regression test (z=14.77, p<0.0001) suggested the
presence of publication bias. Publication bias was also significant (p<0.0001) after stratifying by year
of publication (strata defined as 2013 and earlier, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) and region of study,
with the exception of the “other” region category - only 9 studies were available for analysis within this
stratum (not shown).

4. Discussion
As previously noted by Templeton et al.6, the strength of association between NLR and overall
survival varies significantly between published studies. In our extended meta-analysis, the pooled
hazard ratio for the association between NLR and OS was highest in studies of melanoma and lowest
in studies of brain cancer. While this might initially suggest an association between the
immunogenicity of the cancer and prognostic potential of the NLR, breast cancer also demonstrates a
high pooled HR, and in lung cancer this association is comparably weak. Radiation as primary
treatment also demonstrated a large pooled effect size as compared to that for all studies; other
treatment types and region of study demonstrated only negligible differences.
While clear differences in strength of association are evident between study subgroups, a high
level of inter-study heterogeneity in effect size is also observed within many study subgroups, leading
to large confidence intervals for pooled estimates. Some of this variation may be attributable to
clinical differences that were captured in insufficient detail by the meta-analysis, for example variation
in histologic disease subtypes within one broad cancer type, multi-modality treatment regimens, or
within-region variation in race and ethnicity. The tendency of authors to use minimum p-value
methods for identifying optimal cutoffs for high NLR could also contribute to this observed
heterogeneity; our results suggested that a high threshold for classifying high-risk NLR led to a
significantly higher pooled HR. Further inflation of summary point estimates could be resulting from
publication bias, specifically the underreporting of studies with small effect sizes. As such, the
findings from this and other meta-analyses of the NLR in cancer patients should be interpreted with
caution.
While a large body of literature exists on the prognostic potential of the NLR, the translational
value of this marker in the clinical setting remains to be determined. Based on the results of the
present study, the NLR has greater prognostic value in certain cancer types and for different
therapeutic regimens. Some observations of the earlier meta-analysis by Templeton et al. are

supported in the present study, including that biliary tract, gastroesophageal, and lung cancers exhibit
relatively weaker associations between NLR and OS than kidney and pancreatic cancers. However,
some adjustments to the ranking of HR by cancer type are evident in this expanded analysis: liver
cancer no longer has a low NLR relative to other sites, for example. These discrepancies could be
attributable to the increased number of studies, or could be a result of the inherent weaknesses
outlined above. In either case, efforts are needed to comprehensively examine population subgroups
in which NLR has maximum prognostic power, and to identify clinically meaningful thresholds for risk
stratification within these populations. With this knowledge, prospective evaluation of the prognostic
power of the NLR within these groups can be conducted to determine whether clinical implementation
of the NLR as a prognostic tool is a realistic and attainable goal.
