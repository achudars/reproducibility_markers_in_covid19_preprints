Abstract

19

Background

20

Transcranial electrical stimulation has broad potential as a treatment for depression.

21

Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), which delivers randomly fluctuating current

22

intensities, may have greater cortical excitatory effects compared to other forms of

23

transcranial electrical stimulation. We therefore aimed to investigate the antidepressant

24

efficacy of tRNS.

25

Methods

26

Depressed participants were randomly assigned by computer number generator to receive 20

27

sessions of either active or sham tRNS over four weeks in a double-blinded, parallel group

28

randomized-controlled trial. tRNS was delivered for 30mins with a direct current offset of

29

2mA and a random noise range of 2mA. Primary analyses assessed changes in depression

30

severity using the Montgomery-Asperg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Neuroplasticity,

31

neuropsychological, and safety outcomes were analysed as secondary measures.

32

Results

33

69 participants were randomised, of which three discontinued treatment early leaving 66

34

(sham n = 34, active n = 32) for per-protocol analysis. Depression severity scores reduced in

35

both groups (MADRS reduction in sham = 7.0 [95%CI 5.0-8.9]; and active = 5.2 [95%CI

36

3.2-7.3]). However, there were no differences between active and sham groups in the

37

reduction of depressive symptoms, or the number of participants meeting response (sham =

38

14.7%; active = 3.1%) and remission criteria (sham = 5.9%; active = 0%). Erythema,

39

paraesthesia, fatigue, and dizziness/light-headedness occurred more frequently in the active

40

tRNS group. Neuroplasticity, neuropsychological and acute cognitive effects were

41

comparable between groups.

Conclusion

43

Our results do not support the use of tRNS with the current stimulation parameters as a

44

therapeutic intervention for the treatment of depression.

Clinical Trial Registration:

46

Clinical registration was obtained on the 15th February 2013 from clinicaltrials.gov

47

(NCT01792414) after recruitment of the first study participant on the 30th January 2013, but

48

prior to the participant’s completion of the four week sham-controlled phase of the trial. All

49

remaining participants were recruited following clinical registration.

Introduction
Although there are a number of established treatments for depression, a sizeable

59

proportion of patients still fail to adequately respond, with a conservative estimate of

60

approximately one-third of these not reaching remission even after four trials of different

61

antidepressant medication classes (Rush et al., 2006). In addition, many patients fail to

62

complete a course of antidepressants due to side effects (Trivedi et al., 2006). While

63

electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment, with response rates of

64

up to 70% (Haq et al., 2015), treatment uptake and adherence can be limited by patient

65

concerns over possible cognitive side effects and the need for general anaesthetic. Thus, there

66

has been interest in the development of novel, non-convulsive brain stimulation techniques

67

that are well-tolerated and have a benign side effect profile, such as transcranial electrical

68

stimulation. These neuromodulatory techniques could have the greatest potential for

69

translation into widespread clinical use, being relatively inexpensive, easy to use, portable,

70

and safe (Bikson et al., 2016; Nikolin et al., 2017). Here we report an investigation of the

71

efficacy of one such technique, transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), for the

72

treatment of depression.

73

Transcranial electrical stimulation involves applying a weak electrical current to

74

cerebral tissue via scalp electrodes, resulting in modulation of neuronal membrane potentials

75

and spontaneous firing rates (Nitsche et al., 2008) that can lead to long term changes in

76

cortical excitability and plasticity (Nitsche and Paulus, 2001; Player et al., 2014a). Applying

77

a direct current between the electrodes, referred to as transcranial direct current stimulation

78

(tDCS), has been demonstrated to have antidepressant effects in clinical trials (Loo et al.,

79

2012a; Brunoni et al., 2013b; Brunoni et al., 2017). Recent meta-analyses of randomised,

80

sham-controlled trials have found tDCS to be more effective than sham stimulation, with

81

significantly higher remission and response rates as well as a greater reduction in depressive

82

symptoms (Brunoni et al., 2016; Mutz et al., 2018). As depression has increasingly been

83

conceptualised as a disorder underpinned by disrupted neuroplasticity (Pittenger and Duman,

84

2008; Liu et al., 2017), cumulative changes to synaptic functioning may underlie the

85

therapeutic effects observed in clinical trials of tDCS (Szymkowicz et al., 2016). Modifying

86

stimulation parameters to enhance cortical excitability effects may therefore present a

87

pathway to increase treatment efficacy.

88

tRNS is a more recently developed transcranial electrical stimulation technique that

89

involves randomly fluctuating current intensities over a broad frequency spectrum (between

90

0.1 to 640 Hz). There is some evidence that tRNS has comparable, if not greater, cortical

91

excitatory effects as compared to tDCS (Moliadze et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2015b; Inukai et al.,

92

2016). A single session of 10 minutes of 1 milliampere (mA) tRNS to the motor cortex has

93

been found to produce a greater increase in cortical excitability than tDCS, lasting up to 60

94

minutes beyond the stimulation period (Moliadze et al., 2014; Inukai et al., 2016), although

95

tDCS may lead to a longer period of excitation of at least 90 minutes post-stimulation

96

(Moliadze et al., 2014). tRNS may also be applied with a direct current offset so that the

97

stimulation incorporates neuromodulatory features of tDCS, in addition to limiting

98

homeostatic responses via randomly fluctuating current intensities. Results from Ho et al.

99

(2015b) suggest that tRNS with a direct current offset may be more effective in increasing

100
101

motor cortical excitability than the more common application of tRNS without an offset.
There has been a burgeoning growth in recent years of studies investigating the

102

application of tRNS to enhance sensory processing (Ghin et al., 2018; Rufener et al., 2018;

103

Contemori et al., 2019), motor performance (Abe et al., 2019; Jooss et al., 2019), and

104

cognition (Snowball et al., 2013; Popescu et al., 2016; Mammarella et al., 2017; Shalev et al.,

105

2018; Tyler et al., 2018) in healthy participants with largely promising results. To date,

106

however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of tRNS for clinical/therapeutic uses,

107

with such studies typically characterised by small sample sizes and/or varying efficacy (Chan

108

et al., 2012; Haesebaert et al., 2014; Palm et al., 2016a; Hayward et al., 2017; Kreuzer et al.,

109

2017; Salemi et al., 2019). Regarding the effects of tRNS on mood, there is currently only

110

one report involving treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Chan et al. (2012)

111

reported a case of a patient diagnosed with MDD who had responded to two trials of tDCS (2

112

mA, 20 minutes, 15 sessions over 3 weeks) prior to trialling a 4-week course of open-label

113

tRNS (2 mA range with 1 mA direct current offset, 20 sessions lasting 20 minutes each). It

114

was found that by the 15th session, there was a 63% reduction from baseline in the severity of

115

depressive symptoms, compared with a reduction of 31% and 25% at the end of the acute

116

treatment phase in the two prior trials of tDCS. For all three trials, depression scores at

117

baseline were similar but the patient reported faster improvement with tRNS and lesser skin

118

sensations compared to tDCS. Given this encouraging case report finding, and the potential

119

theoretical advantages of tRNS relative to tDCS, further investigation of the antidepressant

120

effects of tRNS is warranted.

121

The primary aim of this study, therefore, was to conduct the first randomised, sham-

122

controlled trial of tRNS in depression. It was hypothesised that tRNS would have significant

123

antidepressant efficacy compared with a sham control over a 4-week treatment phase. A

124

secondary aim of this study was to examine whether antidepressant effects of tRNS were

125

mediated by restoration of brain neuroplasticity. We hypothesised that antidepressant

126

response to tRNS would be associated with increased brain plasticity, given prior findings of

127

reduced neuroplasticity in depressed individuals compared to healthy matched controls

128

(Player et al., 2013), and findings suggesting a normalisation of neuroplasticity following

129

antidepressant treatment using tDCS (Player et al., 2014b). Lastly, as this is the first treatment

130

trial of tRNS for depression, a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was designed

specifically to be sensitive to symptom changes, measure any adverse cognitive effects, and

132

to assess any potential acute cognitive enhancing effects.

133

Materials and Methods

134

Trial design

135

The main study phase used a double-blinded, parallel, randomized, sham-controlled

136

design. Participants were assigned by a computer-generated random number sequence to one

137

of two groups: active tRNS or sham tRNS. Randomization was stratified according to

138

whether participants were diagnosed with unipolar or bipolar depression. Participants were

139

required to attend a total of 20 tRNS sessions over four weeks conducted on consecutive

140

weekdays during the sham-controlled phase. Participants who missed five or more sessions

141

during the sham-controlled phase were withdrawn from the trial, and were excluded from

142

analyses using a per-protocol approach. All participants were offered an additional 20

143

sessions of open-label active tRNS over four weeks, also administered every weekday. After

144

treatment in the acute daily treatment phases, participants entered a taper phase during which

145

they received once weekly tRNS treatment for four weeks with the final taper session

146

coinciding with a 1-month follow-up visit. Participants were then followed up at 3, 6 and 9

147

months. Participants and raters were blinded to tRNS condition and blinding was maintained

148

until the study was completed and the dataset locked.

149

Mood, neuroplasticity, and neuropsychological function were assessed at the intervals

150

shown in Supplementary Table S1. Adequacy of blinding to treatment was assessed at the end

151

of the sham-controlled phase by asking participants and raters to guess the tRNS condition

152

administered during the first four weeks of treatment. To investigate whether treatment

153

expectations may be a predictor of response, participants completed the Treatment

154

Expectancy Questionnaire (TEQ; see Supplementary Figure S1) at baseline before the first

155

tRNS session.

156

The study was powered for the primary aim of testing efficacy over the sham-

157

controlled phase. From pilot data, it was assumed that tRNS would be at least as effective as

158

tDCS when tested in a sham-controlled trial, given that sampling criteria were very similar.

159

Means and standard deviations of the active and sham treatment groups from our previous,

160

sham-controlled, 3-week trial of tDCS (Loo et al., 2012b) were used, with outcomes

161

extrapolated for a 4-week comparison period. This resulted in an effect size of Cohen’s d =

162

0.7. For 80% power and α = 0.05, a sample of 33 subjects per group was required to

163

demonstrate a difference between active and sham treatment.

164
165
166

Participants
At study entry, participants were at least 18 years old; in a current major depressive

167

episode (as part of a MDD or Bipolar Disorder) of a minimum four weeks duration, defined

168

according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition, text

169

revision; DSM-IV-TR) criteria and established using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric

170

Interview (MINI; Version 5.0.0) (Sheehan et al., 1998) and study clinician assessment; and

171

had a total score of at least 20 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale

172

(MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979). Participants were free of antidepressant

173

medications, or continued on stable doses of antidepressant medications to which they had

174

failed to respond after an adequate course of treatment, with dosage unchanged for at least

175

four weeks prior to study entry. Bipolar participants were required to be on a mood stabilizer

176

medication (e.g. lithium) as prophylaxis against treatment-emergent mania or hypomania for

177

the duration of the study.

178

Exclusion criteria included: psychotic disorder as per DSM-IV-TR; drug or alcohol

179

abuse or dependence within 12 months of study entry; inadequate response to ECT in the

180

current depressive episode; current benzodiazepine medication; rapid clinical response

181

required (e.g., due to high suicide risk); clinically defined neurological disorder or insult;

182

metal in the cranium; skull defects; skin lesions on the scalp at electrode sites; or pregnancy.

183

The study was approved by the human research ethics committee of the University of

184

New South Wales and was conducted at the Black Dog Institute in Sydney, Australia.

185

Participants provided written informed consent for this study. Recruitment began in January

186

2013 and the last follow-up was conducted in 2017. The study was registered with the

187

ClinicalTrials.gov website (Identifier: NCT01792414).

188
189
190

Transcranial random noise stimulation
A DC-Stimulator Plus device (NeuroConn GmbH, Germany) applied high frequency

191

tRNS (100-640 Hz) via two 7 x 5 cm saline-soaked sponge-covered electrodes held in

192

position by a headband. Active tRNS was administered for 30 mins per session with a range

193

of 2 mA and an offset of 2 mA. The anode was placed over F3 (as per the 10-20 international

194

electroencephalogram system), corresponding to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

195

(LDLPFC), and the cathode over F8. For sham stimulation, the current was ramped up over

196

10 s, left on for 30 s, then gradually ramped down over 10 s, so that both treatment groups

197

experienced an initial tingling sensation. The tRNS machine was then left on until the end of

198

the session to preserve blinding. This sham procedure resulted in adequate blinding for tDCS

199

in previous trials (e.g., (Loo et al., 2010; Loo et al., 2012b)), and was therefore expected to be

200

sufficient for tRNS, which produces milder skin sensations compared to tDCS (Ambrus et al.,

201

2010). Participants were comfortably seated at rest and did not engage in any particular tasks

202

during stimulation.

205

Clinical outcome measures
The primary outcome measure for comparing active and sham tRNS was the MADRS,

206

which was administered by trained raters with established inter-rater reliability (intraclass

207

correlation coefficient > 0.7). Secondary measures were the Clinician Global Impression –

208

Improvement (CGI-I) (Guy, 1976), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (Beck et al., 1996) and

209

Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire – Short Form (Q-LES-SF)

210

(Endicott et al., 1993) scales.

211
212

Neuroplasticity outcome measures

213

As an optional study offered to participants in the main tRNS trial, a paired

214

associative stimulation (PAS) paradigm previously described in Player et al. (2012) was used

215

to assess the effects of tRNS on neuroplasticity. The PAS testing was conducted at baseline

216

before the first tRNS session, and again after completion of the sham-controlled and open-

217

label phases. Briefly, the PAS paradigm involves measuring motor evoked potentials (MEPs)

218

following single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) via electromyography

219

(EMG) before and after applying a stimulation protocol (i.e., PAS) to the motor cortex to

220

assess changes in motor cortical excitability (see the Supplementary Material for a detailed

221

description of PAS methodology).

222
223
224

Neuropsychological outcome measures
The following neuropsychological battery was administered to comprehensively

225

assess cognitive function: California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) (Delis et al., 2000) –

226

verbal learning and memory; Ruff 2 & 7 (Ruff and Allen, 1996) – attention processes;

2008) – simple auditory attention and working memory; Symbol Digit Modality Test

229

(SDMT) (Smith, 1991) – psychomotor processing speed; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function

230

System (D-KEFS) Verbal Fluency test (Delis et al., 2001) – phonemic fluency, semantic

231

fluency, cognitive flexibility; and Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (Broadbent et al., 1982) –

232

subjective cognitive functioning. Alternative versions of the CVLT-II, D-KEFS Verbal

233

Fluency, and SDMT were used to minimize practice effects. In addition, computer

234

administered cognitive tests were used to assess safety and acute effects. A simple reaction

235

time test, in which participants were instructed to press a space bar as soon as they saw a

236

cross appear in the middle of a computer screen, was administered immediately before and

237

after the first tRNS session. An Emotion Recognition Task (Montagne et al., 2007), which

238

assessed recognition of six basic facial emotions, was also administered after the first tRNS

239

session.

240
241
242

Physical adverse events
As an additional safety outcome measure, physical adverse events were assessed each

243

session using a tRNS Side Effects Questionnaire (Supplementary Figure S2), adapted from

244

Brunoni et al. (2011), which collected information regarding the type of adverse event, its

245

severity, and its causality.

246
247
248

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics 25

249

for Windows; SPSS Inc.). Outcome measures were analysed for change over the sham-

250

controlled phase using a mixed-effects repeated measures (MERM) model with a restricted

251

number of covariates. Time was entered as a repeated measures factor with an unstructured

252

covariance matrix, tRNS Condition (active or sham) was a between-subjects factor, and

253

subjects were included as a random effect. For mood and quality of life outcomes, covariates

254

were selected based on prior reports of their significant effect on antidepressant response to

255

transcranial electrical stimulation; these included treatment resistance (Brunoni et al., 2016)

256

(assessed by the Maudsley Staging Method (Fekadu et al., 2009)), and presence of concurrent

257

antidepressant medications (Brunoni et al., 2013a; Brunoni et al., 2013c). A MERM model

258

was similarly used for neuropsychological outcomes, with MADRS mood scores at the

259

respective time points included as a covariate. Acute cognitive effects following the first

260

session were examined using a two-way repeated measure analysis of variance

261

(RMANOVA), with factors of tRNS Condition and Time (pre and post session 1). For the

262

Emotion Recognition Task, a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was conducted with the

263

between-subject factor of tRNS Condition.

264

Additional MERM analyses were conducted for the primary outcome measure

265

(MADRS). Baseline scores on the TEQ were added as a covariate to the MERM analysis to

266

test whether treatment expectations modified mood outcomes. To assess whether medication

267

use affected outcomes, each medication class (antidepressants, benzodiazepines,

268

antipsychotics, lithium and anticonvulsants) was entered as the only covariate in separate

269

MERM analyses.

270

The number of responders (defined as a reduction in MADRS total score of ≥ 50%

271

from baseline) and remitters (defined as a final MADRS total score < 10) at the end of the

272

sham-controlled phase were compared between active and sham tRNS groups using a

273

Fisher’s exact test.

274

The association between participant or rater guesses (active or sham) and the

275

participant’s assigned tRNS condition (active or sham) was tested using a Pearson Chi-square

276

test with Yates’ continuity correction. Cohen’s kappa statistic was used to assess agreement

277

Results

281

A total of 69 participants met inclusion criteria and were randomized to receive either active

282

or sham tRNS during the sham-controlled phase (see the CONSORT flow diagram,

283

Supplementary Figure S3). A total of 66 participants (sham: 34, active: 32) completed the

284

sham-controlled phase and were analysed using a per-protocol approach. Table 1 shows

285

demographic and clinical characteristics for active and sham tRNS groups at baseline.

Table 2 shows the results for all MERM analyses of mood and quality of life outcome

measures during the sham-controlled phase. MERM analysis of MADRS scores showed a

296

significant effect of Time (p < 0.001). There was, however, no effect of tRNS Condition (p =

297

0.630), and no significant Time ´ Condition interaction (p = 0.445; see Figure 1). Results

298

from intention-to-treat analyses are also reported for all planned outcomes in Supplementary

Table S2, in accordance with CONSORT guidelines for parallel group randomised control

300

trials (Schulz et al., 2010). Repeating the analysis while incorporating scores from the

301

Treatment Expectations Questionnaire as an additional covariate did not modify outcomes.

302

Concurrent medications did not significantly affect outcomes when entered as covariates in

303

separate MERM analyses (see Supplementary Table S3). Supplementary Table S4 shows

304

results from MERM analyses of all outcome measures acquired during the acute daily

308

One participant in the active tRNS group (3.1%), and five participants receiving sham

309

tRNS (14.7%), were considered treatment responders after completion of the sham-controlled

310

phase (i.e. following 20 sessions of tRNS). Only two participants met the remission criterion,

311

both in the sham tRNS condition (5.9%). Fisher’s exact tests revealed no statistically

312

significant differences between active and sham tRNS conditions for response (p = 0.198)

313

and remission (p = 0.493) rates.

Neuroplasticity outcome measures

328

A total of 44 participants (sham: 25, active: 19) completed the optional PAS study to

Blinding integrity

365

Participants were asked to guess their treatment condition at the end of the double-

366

blinded sham-controlled phase. 75% of participants in the sham condition correctly guessed

367

they received sham tRNS, and 55% of participants in the active condition correctly guessed

368

they had received active tRNS. A Pearson Chi-square test of participant guesses was

369

significant (χ2 = 4.68; p = 0.031), suggesting that participants were not adequately blinded to

370

their treatment condition. To determine whether participant guesses of treatment condition

371

may have influenced mood outcomes, we performed a post-hoc simple linear regression

372

analysis; percent change in MADRS score over the 4-week sham-controlled phase was

373

selected as the dependent variable, and participant guess (active, sham) as the independent

374

variable. This analysis was not statistically significant (R2 = 0.023, F = 1.43, p = 0.237).

375

Blinded study raters were similarly asked to guess participants’ treatment condition at

376

the end of the sham-controlled phase. Raters correctly guessed that participants had received

377

sham tRNS 56% of the time, and active tRNS 31% of the time. A Pearson Chi-square test

378

found this difference not to be statistically significant (χ2 = 0.492; p = 0.483). Furthermore,

379

Cohen’s kappa showed no agreement between participant and rater guesses (κ = 0.134; p =

380

0.329).

Discussion
Here we report the results of the first randomized control trial to examine the efficacy

383

of tRNS for the treatment of depression. Although there was a significant reduction of

384

depressive symptoms over the duration of the study period, there was no difference in the rate

385

of improvement between sham and active tRNS conditions. Further, there was no significant

386

effect of tRNS on neuroplasticity measures in the subset of participants that completed the

387

PAS paradigm, suggesting that stimulation did not increase global cortical excitability. tRNS

388

was found to be safe with no adverse acute cognitive, neuropsychological or severe phyisical

389

side effects. However, tRNS resulted in a higher incidence rate of skin redness (erythema)

390

and paraesthesia (tingling, itching, and burning sensations) in the active condition, as well as

391

fatigue and dizziness/light-headedness, which occurred in fewer than 10% of sessions.

392

Nevertheless, the stimulation protocol was well-tolerated with only one participant dropping-

393

out due to adverse effects, which were not conclusively associated with tRNS.

394

The results of this study do not support the use of tRNS with the current stimulation

395

parameters as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of depression. Despite encouraging

396

initial evidence of significant reductions in depression scores in patients with fibromyalgia

397

(Curatolo et al., 2017), and a case report of improvement in MDD (Chan et al., 2012), mood

398

and quality of life outcomes in the active tRNS group were no different from the placebo-

399

controlled response in the sham group at all time-points. The size of reductions in depressive

400

symptoms observed in both conditions of the present study is broadly similar to the sham

401

condition of previous trials of tDCS for depression (Blumberger et al., 2012; Loo et al.,

402

2012a; Palm et al., 2012; Brunoni et al., 2013b; Bennabi et al., 2015). Of these previous

403

tDCS trials, our study design was most similar to a recent international multisite investigation

404

conducted by our group, which observed improvements in depression scores of 27.8% and

405

22.3% in sham and active tDCS conditions, respectively, as compared to 24.1% and 18.0% in

21

406

sham and active tRNS conditions (Loo et al., 2018). We recruited participants using

407

analogous inclusion/exclusion criteria, participant demographic and clinical characteristics,

408

and adopted comparable stimulation parameters, at least in terms of treatment duration (30

409

minutes), session number and frequency (20 daily weekday sessions), and direct current

410

intensity (2 mA direct current offset in the present study vs a marginally stronger current

411

intensity of 2.5 mA in the tDCS study). Interestingly, the present tRNS trial and Loo et al.

412

(2018) have used the highest total number of sessions and strongest stimulation parameters,

413

including current intensity, compared to other investigations of the antidepressant effects of

414

transcranial electrical stimulation (Blumberger et al., 2012; Loo et al., 2012a; Palm et al.,

415

2012; Brunoni et al., 2013b; Bennabi et al., 2015), with both studies reporting no advantage

416

of active stimulation over sham.

417

The synaptic plasticity hypothesis of depression purports that MDD is characterized

418

by a partial reduction in long-term potentiation-like processes (Player et al., 2013; Kuhn et

419

al., 2016), suggesting that impaired synaptic plasticity, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, is

420

a key feature of the pathophysiology of depression (Goto et al., 2010; Duman et al., 2016;

421

Noda et al., 2018). This hypothesis is supported by evidence that the therapeutic efficacy of

422

antidepressants is, at least partly, due to their capacity to increase neural plasticity (Santarelli

423

et al., 2003; Castrén and Hen, 2013). Similarly, prior work from our group has demonstrated

424

that a course of tDCS increases neuroplasticity and mood outcomes in depression. However,

425

a correlation between these measures could not be confirmed due to the limited sample size

426

(n = 18) (Player et al., 2014b). Despite a larger sample size from which to detect small effects

427

of the intervention, we did not see an increase in neuroplasticity levels following tRNS.

428

Previous research has shown that tRNS can induce acute neuroplastic after-effects, measured

429

by investigating changes to motor cortex excitability using TMS motor evoked potentials

430

(Terney et al., 2008; Chaieb et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2015a). However, there is no evidence to

431

date to suggest cumulative changes in neuroplasticity following a course of multiple repeated

432

sessions of tRNS, as assessed in this study. An important caveat to our results is that only a

433

subset of participants (44/69) completed the PAS study. It is theoretically possible that the

434

subset of participants who underwent the PAS protocol had different clinical, physiological,

435

or behavioural characteristics (e.g. greater levels of motivation) and may thus not be

436

representative of the larger sample.

The exact purported mechanisms of action for prolonged cortical excitation following

438

tRNS are unclear, but may include either 1) temporal summation of neural activity when

439

random noise stimuli and ongoing endogenous neuronal activity occur in close succession

440

(Fertonani et al., 2011), and/or 2) enhancement of neuronal signalling via the principle of

441

stochastic resonance (van der Groen and Wenderoth, 2017). The latter refers to signals that

442

are too weak to exceed a threshold being amplified by adding a random noise stumulus,

443

improving the signal-to-noise ratio and the synchronization and coherence of neuronal

444

networks (Moss et al., 2004; Pavan et al., 2019). Though more research is required to

445

determine which of these mechanisms dominates, the action of tRNS appears to rely heavily

446

on detection and propagation of weak ongoing endogenous neuronal signals. The notion of

447

stochastic resonance has been demonstrated in several tRNS experiments aimed at enhancing

448

sensitivity to sensory inputs, including visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli (van der Groen and

449

Wenderoth, 2017). Interestingly, investigations of auditory (Rufener et al., 2017) and visual

450

(Van der Groen et al., 2018) perceptual thresholds have shown that tRNS has its largest effect

451

on near-threshold stimuli, whereas stimuli clearly above and below threshold were

452

unaffected. It may be for this reason that the only positive randomized control trials using

453

tRNS in clinical populations have stimulated the sensory and motor cortices, specifically in

454

the treatment of tinnitus via the auditory cortex (Vanneste et al., 2013), or stimulation of the

455

motor cortex for chronic pain in fibromyalgia (Curatolo et al., 2017). tRNS may restore the

456

dysfunctional activity in these cortical structures by normalizing their capacity to filter weak

457

signals amidst background neural noise. In complex disorders such as depression, however, it

458

is unclear what the depressed ‘signal’ might be. Studies seeking to use tRNS for other

459

complex disorders by stimulating prefrontal cortical regions have also reported negative

460

findings, i.e. for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Palm et al., 2016b), and vegetative state

461

(Mancuso et al., 2017). Similarly to depression, these illnesses do not consist of a well-

462

defined neural signal whose signalling properties can be augmented by tRNS to revert

463

pathophysiological dysfunctions of brain activity.

464

Although the present study reports null findings for the use of tRNS in depression, it

465

provides valuable information regarding the safety and tolerability of multiple repeated

466

sessions of tRNS. To the best of our knowledge, the previous longest delivery of tRNS was

467

15 sessions (Chan et al., 2012), whereas participants in the current study experienced up to 40

468

sessions over eight weeks if allocated to the active tRNS condition. Adverse events of

469

erythema and paraesthesia were reported more frequently in the active tRNS condition as

470

compared to sham. These results are comparable to those observed in the tDCS literature, in

471

which meta-analyses similarly suggest a greater frequency of erythema and paraesthesia

472

(Moffa et al., 2017; Nikolin et al., 2018). Of interest, fatigue and dizziness/light-headedness

473

were also noted more frequently during active tRNS sessions. These side effects are not a

474

common adverse effect of tDCS and might be unique to the tRNS stimulation parameters

475

used in the current study, for example, due to the current intensity ranging as high as 3 mA (2

476

mA direct offset with ±1 mA amplitude fluctuation). Importantly, fatigue and dizziness/light-

477

headedness occurred rarely, in only 9.2% of sessions for fatigue, and 4.8% for light-

478

headedness. Additionally, these adverse events were transient, resolved on their own shortly

479

after cessation of stimulation, and were not reported to be severe in intensity.

480

A limitation of the present study is that blinding was not preserved, possibly due to

481

the increased incidence of adverse events during active tRNS compared to sham. One would

482

expect inadequate blinding to reduce placebo effects for participants in the sham condition,

483

and potentially enhance them for participants receiving active tRNS, thereby increasing the

484

likelihood of observing a difference between groups. This was not the case in the present

485

study. Indeed, scores for mood outcomes were quantitatively (but not significantly) better in

486

the sham condition compared to active tRNS, suggesting that inadequate blinding did not bias

487

results in favour of the active treatment. Future studies may consider alternative methods to

488

adequately blind participants, including the use of a topical salve beneath the site of

489

stimulation to reduce paraesthetic effects and erythema (McFadden et al., 2011; Guarienti et

490

al., 2015), or comparisons against an active control condition (Fonteneau et al., 2019).

491

A major strength of the present study is the research design, which included double

492

blinding of participants and raters, examination of mood outcomes in addition to

493

neuroplasticity changes, comprehensive assessment of adverse events using

494

neuropsychological and physical measures, reporting of long-term follow-up outcomes up to

495

9-months following completion of the open-label phase, and rigorous statistical analysis

496

methodology informed by CONSORT guidelines.

Conclusion
This study represents the first randomised control trial for the use of tRNS to treat

500

depression. Our findings do not lend support for the use of tRNS as a therapeutic intervention

501

for depression. Antidepressant response was similar between active and sham tRNS

502

conditions. tRNS did not increase motor cortical excitability, a measure of neuroplasticity

503

associated with antidepressant response in other successful therapeutic clinical trials of

504

depression (Santarelli et al., 2003; Castrén and Hen, 2013). The profile of adverse events for

505

tRNS was similar to that of tDCS, with a significantly greater likelihood of erythema and

506

paraesthesia in the active tRNS condition, in addition to a higher incidence rate of fatigue and

507

dizziness/light-headedness. Participant blinding was not preserved and may be related to the

508

increased frequency of side effects in the active condition. Overall, the treatment was well-

509

tolerated by participants.

Paired associative stimulation methods

778

Participants sat in a comfortable, relaxed position with both hands on a pillow. The

779

optimal site for eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the right first dorsal interosseous

780

(FDI) muscle was first established and marked on the scalp. Each participant’s resting motor

781

threshold (RMT) – defined as the minimum stimulus intensity to evoke MEPs of ⩾50 µV in

782

the relaxed FDI in 5 out of 10 consecutive trials of single-pulse TMS – was then measured.

783

TMS intensity for evoking test MEPs was adjusted individually for each participant to elicit

784

an average 1 mV response. TMS intensity for testing MEPs was limited to a maximum of

785

130% of RMT even if the actual intensity needed to elicit a 1 mV response was greater.

786

For the stimulation protocol, single-pulse TMS (130% of RMT) to the FDI

787

representation on the left motor cortex was combined with electrical stimuli (200 µs duration,

788

300% perceptual threshold, DS7 stimulator; Digitimer Co. Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) to the

789

right ulnar nerve proximal to the wrist. Two hundred pairs of stimuli (TMS and ulnar nerve)

790

were given at 0.25 Hz over ∼13 minutes. In each pair, ulnar nerve stimulation preceded TMS

791

by 25 ms. Electrical stimuli were delivered occasionally to the right index finger during PAS.

792

Participants counted the stimuli and reported the number at the end of the session to ensure

793

sensory attention to the hand (Stefan et al., 2004). The MEPs recorded before and after PAS

794

to assess cortical excitability consisted of testing blocks of 20 MEPs at a rate of 0.1 Hz. Two

795

blocks of MEPs were recorded at baseline. A block of MEPs was recorded immediately after

796

PAS and then every 10 mins for one hour. During all stimulation, EMG from the FDI was

797

monitored to ensure muscle relaxation. MEPs were discarded if EMG showed substantial

798

muscle activity (i.e. peak-to-peak amplitude ³ 50 µV) in the time window prior to the TMS

799

stimuli. Additionally, block-averaged MEP amplitudes were considered outliers if they were

more than 4 standard deviations from the mean for active and sham tRNS conditions

801

combined.

802

EMG activity was recorded through Ag/AgCl surface electrodes over the right FDI. EMG

803

was amplified, bandpass filtered (16–1000 Hz), and digitized (2000 Hz) (Cambridge

804

Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK). TMS (Magstim 200 stimulator, Magstim Co.,

805

Whitland, UK) was applied using a 70-mm figure-of eight coil oriented with the handle

806

posterolateral, 45° to the parasagittal plane.
