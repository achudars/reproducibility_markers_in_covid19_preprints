Abstract

2

Introduction: Lifestyle interventions have been shown to produce favorable changes in some

3

health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, few such studies,

4

employing “real world” methods have been completed in patients with CKD.

5

Objective: This study tested the effectiveness of a comprehensive, multicomponent, lifestyle

6

intervention, delivered through individualized counseling on a variety of health outcomes in pre-

7

dialysis CKD patients.

8

Methods: Eligible patients were assigned randomly to the intervention (TR) or usual care group

9

(UC). A six-month home-based program involving personalized counseling to increase physical

10

activity to recommended levels among stage G3a to G4 CKD patients while exchanging plant

11

proteins for animal proteins was implemented. Physical function, cardiovascular function,

12

dietary intake, medication use, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were assessed at

13

baseline and after 1-month, 3-months (M3) and 6-months (M6).

14

Results: Forty-two, patients (age 60.2 ± 9.2, BMI 34.5 ± 7.8) participated in this study (TR=27

15

UC=15). The intervention reduced (p<0.05) brachial (bSBP) and central systolic blood pressures

16

(cSBP) at month 3 (M3) but both were attenuated at month 6 (M6). Scores on the effect of

17

kidney disease subscale of the HRQOL measure improved in the intervention group at M3 and

18

M6. There was no change in the other measures of HRQOL or in any physical function scores.

19

Conclusions: This personalized multi-component lifestyle intervention enabled CKD patients to

20

self-report fewer concerns with how CKD affected their daily lives independent of changes in

21

physical function.

22

Key words: Home-based exercise programs, plant-based nutrition

Introduction
Thirty million adults within the United States are estimated to have chronic kidney

25

disease (CKD)(1),(2). Lifestyle interventions can improve health outcomes in chronic

26

diseases(3)(4). Navaneethan et al(2) reported that a 1-year pilot program among predialysis

27

participants led to a 6% reduction in weight that was associated with favorable changes in

28

various biomarkers. They also showed a slower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

29

decline in the intervention group(2). Howden et al.(3) examined the impact of a lifestyle

30

intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD)

31

in stage 3-4 CKD participants. They found that CRF can be improved in CKD participants when

32

appropriate lifestyle interventions are employed(3).

33

Among the studies that have incorporated lifestyle interventions involving CKD

34

participants, apart from Howden et al.,(5) most, have focused on diet and exercise interventions

35

only(3)(6). Few have utilized behavioral interventions, although some have also included

36

behavioral counseling, delivered in a group setting Howden et al., 2013, (5) or individually via

37

telephone (7). Few have reported using behavioral counseling delivered in person on an

38

individual basis. Furthermore, many have used in-center programs which have the advantage of

39

offering direct patient supervision, but may not be practical to implement in clinical practice.

40

Providing participants with instructions to follow at home is seen as a pragmatic approach(8).

41

The aim of this 6-month randomized controlled trial was to determine the effectiveness of

42

an individualized, comprehensive, lifestyle intervention program including dietary, physical

43

activity, pharmaceutical, and behavioral counseling, on physical function, cardiovascular

44

function, dietary intake, medication adherence, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life

45

(HRQOL) in a sample of pre-dialysis CKD patients. We hypothesized that individuals who

46

participated in the intervention program (TR) would show greater improvements in all dependent

47

variables compared to individuals in the usual care (UC)group.

48

Materials & Methods

49

Participants were recruited from a nephrology practice in Western Massachusetts and

50

were cleared by their nephrologists prior to participation. Eligible (stage G3a-G4, eGFRs 15-59

51

ml/min/1.73m2 18-75 years, and currently inactive) participants signed a consent form that had

52

been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both Springfield College and Western New

53

England University. Exclusionary criteria included contraindications to exercise as defined by

54

the American College of Sports Medicine (9), current use of patiromer, contraindication to

55

patiromer use, and current involvement in an exercise program.

56

Individuals were assigned randomly to either TR or UC in a 2:1 ratio. Serum potassium

57

(K+) levels were monitored on a monthly basis since participants were encouraged to adopt a

58

plant-based diet. For individuals in TR, if K+ was greater than 5.2 mEq/L, they were prescribed

59

patiromer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. UC received the current standard

60

of care. They were allowed to take patiromer, if prescribed independently by their physician.

61

Testing: Participants were tested on four occasions; baseline (BL), month 1 (M1), month

62

3 (M3) and month 6 (M6). During the morning of each test day, participants were assessed for

63

anthropometrics, brachial (bBP), central blood pressures (cBP), augmentation index (AIx@75)

64

using the SphygmoCor Excel device (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Other

65

assessments included medication adherence, using the Morisky 8-point scale (MMAS-8), the

66

functional movement screen (FMS), the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the short physical

67

performance battery (SPPB), and leg extension, leg curl strength, and power using a

68

computerized dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). Participants also completed

69

the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life (KDQOL) - Short Form (10), the Self-Efficacy to

70

Regulate Exercise Habits Questionnaire (11), and the Self-Efficacy to Regulate Eating Habits

71

Questionnaire. (12) Identical procedures were followed at BL, M1 and M3. At BL and M6, when

72

blood samples were taken for (K+), some was also used for the assessment of other biomarkers.

73

Blood parameter analysis: The inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and

74

interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified by immunoassay using commercially available kits. Other

75

analytes (i.e., K+ and Phos) were analyzed using standard laboratory methods.

76

Individual counseling: Following testing sessions, individuals assigned to TR received a

77

counseling intervention. These participants were instructed as to how to prepare a plant-based

78

meal and subsequently ate a plant-based meal for lunch. Following lunch, participants received

79

one-on-one counseling for nutrition, physical activity, pharmacy, and behavior change. UC were

80

told to follow the normal instructions of their nephrologist.

81

Nutrition: Participants kept a 3-day food log prior to each visit. The logs were analyzed

82

and then individually reviewed with the participant during their nutritional counseling session.

83

Specific attention was paid to the amount and quality of protein, sodium (Na) and Phos in the

84

diet. Recommendations for dietary modifications were based on a vegan approach. Participants

85

in TR were encouraged to decrease the animal protein consumed and choose more plant-based

86

meals. Individual barriers to success in achieving the suggested dietary modifications were

87

addressed, and strategies to implement the changes were discussed based on the participant’s

88

individual circumstances. During the first session, participants watched a cooking demonstration

89

video in which a chef prepared a vegan meal. Strategies to enhance the flavor and appeal of

90

plant-based meals were presented. Participants in TR had an unrestricted K+ diet.

91

Physical fitness methods: Based upon the results of the FMS, individuals were advised

92

as to the types of exercises they should perform. The recommended exercises were demonstrated

93

for each participant along with a set of stretches. Participants in TR received a packet with

94

instructions and illustrations of how to correctly perform the recommended movements. They

95

were also instructed to walk for at least 30 minutes, 5 times per week at a moderate intensity to

96

comply with standard physical activity recommendations(9). Participants were instructed to

97

avoid prolonged periods in sedentary behavior (SB) by aiming to reduce sitting time (13).

98

The study coordinator attempted to contact the participants weekly during the

99

intervention period to review the exercise program and to discuss any challenges that they might

100

have encountered.(14). Participants were encouraged to contact the study coordinator if they had

101

questions or needed clarification regarding their home-based exercise program.

102

Pharmacy: Participants were specifically asked to bring all prescription (including those

103

only taken as needed), and over-the-counter medications with them on test days (see Table 1).

104

Participants provided their medications to the pharmacist who documented each medication

105

including dosage directions and evaluated each medication for nephrotoxic effects, interactions,

106

contraindications, and medication appropriateness in CKD. At BL, this was done for each patient

107

without the pharmacist’s knowledge of patient group assignment. Any potentially nephrotoxic

108

medication was addressed with the Medical Director of the study.

109

Once participants were randomized, those assigned to UC were excused without

110

pharmacy associated changes as long as they were not taking medications identified as

111

potentially harmful or nephrotoxic. Participants in TR met individually with the

112

pharmacist. Based upon the information gathered, the pharmacist made evidence-based

113

suggestions as part of the intervention. Medication schedule was based on pharmacokinetic and

114

pharmacodynamic considerations as well as therapeutic guideline recommendations. Participants

115

were educated about medication indication, benefit of nocturnal dosing of at least one

116

antihypertension medication, and over-the-counter and herbal medications to eliminate or avoid

117

(e.g., NSAIDs). PharmD investigators utilized study blood pressures and lab results to

118

recommend initiation or dosing changes for ACEI, ARBs, and Aldosterone blocking agents.

119

These recommendations were provided to the participant’s nephrologist for approval.

120

Participants indicated for patiromer, per study protocol, received education about the

121

drug. The administration of the patiromer complied with the package insert. The pharmacists

122

designed medication schedules incorporating patiromer and allowing for appropriate spacing

123

from other medications.

124

125

126

127

128

129

130

For participants in TR, the pharmacist utilized the following algorithm based on the 2012
KDIGO guidelines (15) and with medical provider approval:
1) If the participant was on a RAS blocker, the dose was titrated up to a maximal dose in
order to achieve a BP <130/80.
2) If the patient had an elevated urinary albumin excretion, the RAS inhibitor dose was also
titrated to the maximal dose.
3) If K+ was >5.2 mEq/L, patiromer was provided and dosed according to the package

131

insert.

132

Behavior: From a behavior change perspective, the key features of the intervention were:

133

an assessment of current physical activity and dietary habits, an assessment of the perceived

134

benefits, barriers, and costs of behavior change, and patient participation in goal setting and

135

developing personalized strategies to overcome barriers and prevent relapse. Regular self6

136

assessment was used to empower participants to take responsibility for their own decisions and

137

to make informed choices.

138

The study coordinator aimed to make follow-up contact with the participants on a weekly

139

basis post-assessment, however she was unable to reach some participants as scheduled. This

140

contact focused on the extent to which participants had achieved their goals since last contact,

141

and offered reinforcement and assistance in problem-solving utilizing additional strategies as

142

appropriate. Participants also received written materials tailored to their current concerns.

143

Statistics

144

Data on the primary outcomes at 6 months (M6) were analyzed using a 2 (group: TR/UC)

145

x 2 (time: baseline/M6) mixed factor ANOVA, with a focus on the interaction between group

146

and time. Similar separate analyses were conducted at secondary endpoints of M1 and M3 . All

147

data were screened for violations of assumptions for these statistical tests. The alpha level was

148

set at p < 0.05 for all analyses.

149

Results:

150

Patient characteristics

151

Forty-two patients consented and started the study (see Figure 1 consort diagram). The baseline

152

characteristics and demographic data of the participants are presented in Table 2. Following

153

randomization, 27 were assigned to TR and 15 to UC. Analyses were conducted on 37

154

participants since 5 were eliminated due to only having BL data. Over the course of the study

155

there were no changes in any anthropometric variables (see Table 3).

157

Physical function

158

The intervention had no effect on any of the functional measures or indices of muscle strength or

159

power (see Table 3).

160

Sedentary time

161

The assessment of sedentary time was completed at BL, M3 and M6. Participants in both groups

162

spent 67-69% of their waking day being sedentary. This did not change over time and was not

163

different between the two groups (See Table 3)

164

Cardiovascular Function

165

There was a reduction in both brachial (bSBP) and central systolic blood pressures (cSBP) at M3

166

(p = .01) in TR, which was not apparent at M6. Central diastolic blood pressure (cDBP) was

167

reduced by M3 while brachial diastolic blood pressure (bDBP) was not different between the two

168

groups at M3. M6 readings were not different from BL or between groups. Central pulse

169

pressure values did not differ over time or between groups during the duration of the study.

170

Augmentation index (AIx@75) did not change from BL to M6 in TR but dropped in UC (p <

171

0.05) (see Table 3).

172

Nutritional information

173

Total caloric intake (kcals) was reduced in TR at M6 (p = 0.03), but not in the UC group. Protein

174

intake did not differ over time or between groups during the study. Sodium (mg) intake was

175

different between groups at M1 with the UG group increasing their intake while TR had a

176

modest reduction. Phosphorus (mg) intake trended downwards at M6 compared to BL in TR

177

compared to the UC group (p=0.05) (See Table 3).

178

Blood parameters

179

Serum K+ (mmol/L) remained stable throughout the study in both groups. Though not reaching

180

statistical significance, serum Phos (mg/dl) levels trended downward in TR by M6, while there

181

was a tendency for it to rise in UC. Neither IL-6 nor CRP changed over the study (see Table 3).

182

Behavioral information

183

Neither self-efficacy to adhere to exercise nor self-efficacy to adhere to dietary recommendations

184

changed over time or between groups over the course of the study. Of the five subscales of the

185

KDQOL, the Effects of Kidney Disease on Daily Life showed significant findings (p=0.02).

186

Changes in Effects of Kidney Disease on daily life for TR compared to UC did not show a

187

significant difference in change from BL to M1 but did show a significant difference for the

188

change from BL to M3 and M6. UC decreased from BL to M3 and M6, while TR increased. (See

189

Table 3).

190

Medication use

191

Eleven participants in TR were administered patiromer, according to administration guidelines,

192

and 2 stopped taking their ACE/ARB medication at 3 months. Of the 37 participants with data in

193

the study, 5 had changes to their ACE/ARB medications across the 6-month time period. One

194

participant in UC stopped taking their ACE/ARB medication between 3 and 6 months. Two

195

participants who were in TR and were not taking patiromer, at any time during the study started

196

taking ACE/ARB at the 3-month assessment and continued through to M6.

200

pharmaceutical, and behavioral counseling on physical function, cardiovascular function, diet,

201

and HRQOL in a sample of pre-dialysis CKD patients. We found that within the timeframe of

202

this study, our intervention had no measurable effect on physical function, modest effects on

203

cardiovascular function and nutritional intake but a major impact upon HRQOL in our sample of

204

patients with CKD.

205

The most notable finding in this study was the significant and sustained impact of the

206

intervention on self-reported effects of CKD. Efforts to make health care more patient-centered

207

require greater knowledge of patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life (QOL), where

208

information comes directly from a patient without clinician interpretation. Such information

209

provides meaningful insight as to the impact of disease and therapeutic interventions on daily

210

life. CKD patients place tremendous value on their HRQOL, even over survival, and reportedly

211

use impact on QOL to guide their therapeutic choices (16)

212

The QOL of CKD patients is a frequently overlooked yet critical consideration when

213

evaluating their overall medical care (17). People living with CKD experience a high symptom

214

burden with progressively impaired physical function and physical activity levels which can

215

negatively affect HRQOL(18). In this study we found that CKD patients randomized to TR

216

experienced significant improvements in their ability to live with CKD in their daily life.

217

Positive changes that are clinically meaningful were also found for other aspects of HRQOL,

218

including mental functioning, symptoms and problems associated with CKD and the perceived

219

burden of CKD. Interestingly, these improvements in HRQOL were reported even in the absence

220

of significant changes in physical function.

221

222

Most lifestyle studies involving CKD participants have focused on supervised exercise in
association with dietary modification(3)(6). Howden et al. (5) utilized a comprehensive
10

223

approach, involving frequent patient contact. They used a combination of supervised training (8

224

weeks) followed by a 10-month home-based program. This hybrid program produced

225

improvement in the 6MWT distances in the intervention group. In contrast, our 6-month home-

226

based program resulted in no improvements in any functional measures. However, despite this,

227

we still observed meaningful changes in HRQOL.

228

Another notable finding in this study was the reduction in bSBP and cSBP that occurred

229

at M3 in TR. Such a reduction in blood pressure is medically important due to the role that

230

elevated blood pressure plays in the development of cardiovascular disease and progression of

231

CKD. However, this reduction in blood pressure was not statistically significant at M6. We

232

speculate that the gap in direct patient contact between M3 and M6 may have had an impact

233

upon the attenuation of the BP reduction that was observed in TR by M6.

234

The pattern of change in blood pressure that was observed in this study is similar to what

235

has been reported by Meuleman et al. (19) regarding Na restriction in a group of CKD

236

participants. Similar to our study, Meuleman et al. (19) used a behavior change approach to get

237

CKD participants to reduce their Na intake. As was seen in this study, the results of their

238

intervention diminished between M3 to M6. In the current study, participants were contacted by

239

the study coordinator over the phone or via email during the M3 to M6 period but there was no

240

other direct in-person contact. Perhaps our findings suggest that there is need for study personnel

241

to have direct contact with the participants to increase the probability of the latter adhering to the

242

positive behavioral changes made. In contrast to the poor adherence to the home-based

243

programming that we and others report, Van Craenenbroeck et al. (20) (21)reported excellent

244

compliance to their 12-week, home-based exercise program. This could have been influenced by

245

the fact that participants in the intervention group received an exercise bike (21).

246

One unusual finding in this study was a decrease in AIx@75 in UC at M6 with no change

247

in TR. AIx@75 is a surrogate measure of arterial stiffness(3)which is a positive non-traditional

248

risk factor for CVD (21). Researchers have reported mixed findings regarding the impact of

249

exercise training on indices of arterial stiffness. In supervised studies lasting from 16 weeks to 12

250

months, researchers have found little evidence for exercise training affecting arterial stiffness as

251

measured by either pulse wave velocity, or AIx75(3) (21). However, Mustata et al.(22)have

252

reported a reduction in AIx in a sample of CKD participants after a 12-month hybrid

253

supervised/home based program.

254

The intervention resulted in some important changes in nutritional intake. Participants

255

randomized to TR decreased their intake of Na and by M6 they also consumed 300 mg less Phos

256

than at BL. This change in Phos intake was reflected in their serum Phos levels which trended

257

downwards at M6. Participants had been counseled to decrease their intake of animal protein but

258

from the analyses performed it was impossible to decipher their protein source, (i.e., animal or

259

plant). No restriction was placed upon their K+ intake which we assumed would be higher if they

260

transitioned to a more plant-based diet.

261

Another observation that was noted in those randomized to TR was evidenced by the fact

262

that at M6 participants in TR consumed 346 kcals less than at BL. The change in kcals, however

263

was not enough to translate into changes in body weight or body composition. This is in contrast

264

to what Howden et al. (5)found for their intervention at the 6-month mark.

265

Over the course of the study we carefully monitored both the doses and types of

266

medications used by the participants. We found a slight increase in the use of ACE/ARB in TR

267

with a slight decrease in UC. These changes did not reach statistical significance but the

268

observation of a trend toward higher use of ACE/ARBs in TR, might suggest that the availability

269

of patiromer to this group had an influence.

270

A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this study.

271

The study duration was relatively short; a longer time period is needed to see changes in some of

272

the parameters examined. We opted to use a totally home-based approach, thereby attempting to

273

assess the effectiveness of our approach under ‘real-world’ (unsupervised) conditions. However,

274

this meant that our results were affected by patient compliance to the tailored recommendations

275

and though the study coordinator made a great effort, it was difficult to contact all patients as

276

frequently as we had intended(8).

277

In conclusion, we have shown that a comprehensive, individualized, multicomponent

278

program with behavioral counseling and close patient follow-up enables patients with CKD to

279

feel better about managing their disease even without substantial changes in physical function.

280

We believe this finding is unique; previously reported improvements in HRQOL following

281

lifestyle intervention programs are coupled with changes in physical function (23). We also

282

report modest changes in blood pressure and some aspects of nutritional intake, but patients

283

feeling less bothered by their disease was the most important finding of this short trial. The

284

importance of HRQOL is underscored by the association between QOL measures and mortality

285

and hospitalization rates in dialysis patients(24). Future long-term studies (at least 24 months)

286

are needed to explore the possibility that a comprehensive lifestyle intervention might result in

287

favorable changes to key physiological parameters that impact upon cardiovascular disease and

288

the progression of CKD, in addition to sustained improvements in the HRQOL of CKD patients.
