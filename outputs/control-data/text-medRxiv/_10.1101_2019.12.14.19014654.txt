Abstract
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative

3

treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate

4

patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on

5

similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present

6

study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized

7

prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner. We succeeded in

8

generating personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival (OS),

9

progression-free survival (PFS), relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality

10

(NRM) adjusted for new allo-HCT candidates by eight pre-transplant factors using our

11

interactive web application

12

(https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). A random

13

survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our

14

institution was applied to develop this application. To assess its predictive

15

performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) to

16

develop the predictive model and test cohort (30%) to confirm its performance

17

time-sequentially. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for

18

1-year OS, PFS, relapse/progression, and NRM in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73,

19

and 0.77, respectively. In conclusion, the new web application could allow transplant

INTRODUCTION

2

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is an advanced

3

therapeutic intervention required for high-risk malignant hematological disorders [1].

4

Various complex and intertwined pre-transplant factors affect patient prognosis after

5

allo-HCT [2-5]. Transplant clinicians need to estimate individual prognosis after

6

allo-HCT in clinical practice by combining not only certain indices that can stratify the

7

prognosis after allo-HCT, such as refined Disease Risk Index (DRI-R), EBMT risk

8

score, and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) [6-8], but

9

also individual factors (e.g., age, performance status [PS], disease status, or the

10

number of transplantations) and transplant procedures (e.g., donor source or

11

conditioning regimen). However, the predictive capacities of these prognostic indices

12

remain suboptimal [2]. Furthermore, prognosis prediction based on the empirical

13

integration of multiple patient-specific factors by the clinician is not always objective

14

due to the complexity of allo-HCT treatment.

15

A random survival forest (RSF) is an ensemble machine learning method for

16

right-censored time-to-event data analysis. Recently, RSF has become increasingly

17

popular for survival data analysis in various medical fields because of its

18

high-precision predictions [9-11]. It is possible to develop a prognosis prediction

19

model integrating multiple factors to compute patient-specific prognosis prediction

curves such as survival or cumulative incidence adjusted for individual factors of a

2

new patient using RSF [12]. Although the most popular model for survival analysis is

3

the Cox proportional hazard (Cox PH) regression, RSF has some advantages over

4

the Cox PH model. First, RSF can easily deal with non-linear effects, correlated

5

parameters, and variable interaction. Second, while the Cox PH model may be limited

6

due to the proportional hazards assumption, RSF is non-parametric and completely

7

independent of model assumptions [11, 13]. Therefore, survival prediction analysis by

8

RSF may provide novel insights into the allo-HCT field.

9

Although objective and accurate patient-specific prognosis prediction using a

10

machine learning model can be quite informative for clinicians and patients in clinical

11

decision-making, it has not been applied in a clinical setting. A user-friendly tool for

12

constructing accurate personalized prognosis prediction curves after allo-HCT is

13

lacking. Such a tool could allow transplant clinicians to inform patients of

14

patient-specific prognosis prediction objectively derived from past patient data, and

15

build an optimal personalized treatment strategy.

16

Here, we developed a web application tool with a graphical user interface (GUI)

17

capable of plotting the personalized survival and cumulative incidence prediction

18

curves after allo-HCT adjusted by eight patient-specific factors, which are known as

19

prognostic predictors, using RSF and assessed their predictive performances.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

3

Patients and Definition

4

This study, comprising retrospective prognostic modeling, analyzed a group

5

of consecutive patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution between January

6

2008 and November 2017. All pre-transplant factors were recorded in the medical

7

chart within 28 days prior to conditioning. The conditioning regimen containing either

8

total body irradiation in fractionated doses greater than 8 Gy, an oral busulfan dose of

9

9 mg/kg or more, an intravenous busulfan dose of 7.2 mg/kg or more, or a melphalan

10

dose of 140 mg/m2 or more was defined as myeloablative in line with a previous

11

report [14]. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility was defined by DNA typing

12

for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DR. This study was approved by the Osaka City

13

University Hospital Certified Review Board.

15

Supportive Care

16

Prophylactic antibiotics, either levofloxacin or polymyxin B oral tablets, an

17

antifungal agent, and acyclovir were routinely administered from the start of

18

conditioning. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also administered from the start of

19

conditioning to 2 days prior to allo-HCT and after neutrophil engraftment to prevent

Predictors and Outcomes

7

Eight pre-transplant factors known as prognostic predictors for allo-HCT,

8

including recipients’ age, DRI-R, HCT-CI, PS, donor source (related bone marrow

9

[rBM], related peripheral blood [rPB], unrelated bone marrow [uBM], cord blood [CB],

10

or haploidentical peripheral blood [haplo-PB]), HLA compatibility, conditioning

11

intensity (myeloablative conditioning [MAC] or reduced intensity conditioning [RIC]),

12

and the number of allo-HCT were used as predictive variables [2-5].

13

The predictive objectives were prediction of 1-year overall survival (OS),

14

1-year progression-free survival (PFS), and 1-year cumulative incidences of

15

relapse/progression and non-relapse mortality (NRM). An OS event was defined as

16

death from any cause. PFS was defined as survival without relapse/progression.

17

NRM was defined as death without relapse/progression. We considered cases that

18

never achieved complete remission after allo-HCT as relapse/progression on day 1

19

after allo-HCT. Relapse/progression and NRM were treated as competing events with

Statistical Analysis

6

The following is a summary of the analysis outline: (i) preprocessing data

7

quality assurance, (ii) development of a web application tool, and (iii) assessment of

8

the predictive performance for OS, PFS, relapse/progression, and NRM in

9

accordance with the Type 2b (nonrandom split-sample development and validation)

10

of prediction model studies covered by the Transparent Reporting of a prediction

11

model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement [16]. We had no

12

missing data. The number of trees to develop the RSF model was set as 500. A

13

log-rank splitting rule was used to grow survival trees of a forest.

14

We used R package randomForestSRC [17] for analysis of the RSF model, R

15

package timeROC [18] for calculating AUCs, and R package shiny/R for development

16

of the web application. All analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. We adhere

17

to the TRIPOD statement [16].

All predictive performances were calculated using the time-dependent area

2

under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) [18]. First, the entire cohort

3

was split into a training cohort (70%) and test cohort (30%) time-sequentially. Second,

4

the optimal number of variables randomly selected as candidates for splitting a node,

5

which is a hyperparameter in the RSF model, for each outcome was tuned using

6

5-fold cross-validation method in the training cohort [19]. It was defined as the one

7

with the highest AUC value. Third, we assessed the predictive performances of the

8

RSF, Cox PH model, DRI-R, and HCT-CI for 1-year OS and PFS, and of RSF, DRI-R,

9

and HCT-CI for 1-year relapse/progression and NRM in test cohort. We plotted

10

time-sequential AUCs per month from 3 to 12 months after allo-HCT in the test cohort

11

to assess the continuous predictive performances in each prognosis prediction curve.

The schema of the assessment method for these predictive models is shown in

RESULTS

4

Patients and Transplantations

5

Three hundred and eighty-four patients underwent allo-HCT. One patient who

6

underwent transplant from unrelated peripheral blood stem cells was excluded due to

7

insufficient sample for analysis. Since DRI-R cannot be scored when there is benign

8

or rare disease, 21 patients were also excluded (aplastic anemia, 11; Idiopathic

9

cytopenia of undetermined significance, 1; chronic active Epstein–Barr virus disease,

4;

plasma

cell

leukemia,

1;

chronic

myelomonocytic

leukemia,

2;

11

myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, unclassifiable, 1). In total, 363

12

patients were analyzed in this study. The clinical characteristics of the entire cohort

13

are listed in Table 1. The median follow-up period for the survivor in the entire cohort

14

was 51.9 months (range; 2.4-127.9 months). The 1-year OS and PFS after allo-HCT

15

of the entire cohort were 62.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 57.5-67.5) and 49.6%

16

(95% CI; 44.3-54.6). The 1-year cumulative incidences of relapse/progression and

17

NRM in the entire cohort were 40.5% (95% CI; 35.4-45.5) and 9.9% (95% CI;

18

7.1-13.3), respectively. The clinical characteristics and outcomes in the training

19

cohort (254/363) and test cohort (109/363) are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Interactive Web Application for Plotting Personalized Prognosis Prediction Curves

3

The interactive web application that shows the personalized 1-year prognosis

4

prediction curves after allo-HCT is shown in Fig. 1. Users choose an outcome they

5

intend to predict among OS, PFS, relapse/progression, or NRM in the select box at

6

left-top (a). Next, after users set eight patient-specific factors in the left side-panel (b)

7

and click the “prediction” button (c), the personalized 1-year prognosis prediction

8

curve is displayed in the main panel (d). For example, Fig. 1 shows the personalized

9

1-year OS prediction curve after allo-HCT for a patient whose eight pre-transplant

10

factors are as follows: age, 50; DRI-R, high; PS, 1; HCT-CI, 1; conditioning intensity,

11

MAC; HLA compatibility, matched; donor source, rPB; the number of allo-HCT, 1. This

12

patient’s 1-year OS rate after allo-HCT is predicted at 59.1%. Users can also see the

13

personalized 1-year PFS curve and cumulative incidence prediction curves of

14

relapse/progression and NRM after allo-HCT. We provided an online interface to use

are shown in Fig. 2. The predictive performances of RSF for OS and PFS were

15

comparable to those of the Cox PH model at any time-point. The predictive

We succeeded in developing an interactive web application tool with GUI

2

capable of accurately, objectively, and rapidly generating the four types of

3

personalized 1-year prognosis prediction curves after allo-HCT in just a few steps

4

using machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous

5

reports regarding the development of a similar interactive tool that can provide

6

various types of patient-specific prognosis prediction curves in allo-HCT.

7

Some predictive indices of prognosis after allo-HCT such as DRI-R, HCT-CI,

8

EBMT risk score, and pre-transplantation assessment of mortality score have been

9

reported [2, 6-8, 20]. Although these indices can stratify prognosis after allo-HCT,

10

transplant clinicians need to empirically consider various additional factors, such as

11

age, PS, donor source, or conditioning regimen, to estimate patient-specific

12

prognosis in clinical practice. Our web application tool can calculate and plot

13

personalized prognosis prediction curves more objectively than a clinician’s empirical

14

estimate and more accurately than any single prognosis index.

15

Shouval et al. developed a website to predict prognosis after allo-HCT using

16

the alternating decision tree (ADTree), which is a machine learning model [21]. Users

17

can obtain personalized prognostic predictive information such as day 100 mortality

18

by providing certain individual pre-transplant factors for a new transplant candidate.

19

However, the ADTree model cannot treat time-to-event data, whereas the RSF is a

1

machine learning algorithm for survival analysis that can take the right-censored data

2

or competing risks into consideration [12, 22]. Hence, our web application can not

3

only provide prognosis prediction value for a fixed time point but also plot continuous

4

survival and cumulative incidence prediction curves until 1 year after allo-HCT (Fig. 1).

5

Moreover, users can simulate various transplant settings for a particular patient

6

intuitively with just a few clicks using mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones

7

as well as computers because our web application was developed using shiny/R

8

library to ensure interactivity. Consequently, our web application can help transplant

9

clinicians inform a new allo-HCT candidate of their personalized prognosis estimate in

10

clinical practice, and it can provide both the clinician and candidate with valuable

11

information to help make clinical decisions.

12

Shouval et al. also reported on the prognosis prediction performance after

13

allo-HCT by ADTree using registry data in European Group for Blood and Marrow

14

Transplantation (EBMT) and Italian Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation (GITMO)

15

and showed that the time-dependent AUCs for 2-year OS were 0.66 and 0.65,

16

respectively [21, 23]. Their prediction model developed using large amounts of patient

17

data is quite relevant, because it can be used widely as a generalized prediction

18

model in allo-HCT fields. However, various biases related to transplant institutes or

19

countries are inherent in allo-HCT. For example, there are differences in the

1

indications for allo-HCT, transplant experiences, patient characteristics, and strategy

2

for donor source selection, conditioning regimen, or transplant-related complications

3

among the transplant institutes or countries. Therefore, some reports have shown

4

that there is a significant difference in prognosis after allo-HCT among transplant

5

centers or countries [24, 25]. The prediction model developed using data from a

6

single institution is protected from bias based on the differences among the transplant

7

institutes as long as it is used within that institute, because the patient characteristics

8

or transplant procedures similar to those of the training cohort by which the prediction

9

model was developed are likely to be inherited by future patients at that institute.

10

Furthermore, the noise of data collected from a single institute may be less than that

11

of multicenter data, because the methods of clinical assessment or data collection

12

could be consistent in a single institute. Hence, an in-house developed prognosis

13

prediction model may have more advantages for prognosis predictive performance

14

after allo-HCT in a particular institute than the prediction model based on data

15

sourced from multiple institutions. Supporting this idea, Fuse et al. also showed that

16

the predictive performance of relapse in a single institute where the predictive model

17

was developed using ADTree was better than that in another institute using the

18

identical predictive model (AUC; 0.75 vs 0.67) [26]. We have published the source

19

code of our web application on the Internet. Each transplant center can also develop

predictive performances for 1-year OS, EFS, relapse/progression in the test cohort

9

were worse than those in the training cohort (Table 2, 3). These results could be

10

attributed to the difference in the year of allo-HCT between the training and test

11

cohorts. The predictive performances of the RSF model trained by the entire cohort,

12

which was used in the web application, is shown in supplementary table 2. However,

13

the predictive performances for the new allo-HCT candidates in this web application

14

may not be as high as those shown in supplementary table 2 because the allo-HCT

15

procedures and patient characteristics may have changed over time.

16

This study has several limitations. First, the predictive performance of our web

17

application for new allo-HCT candidates in other institutes is unknown since our

18

model has not obtained external validation. However, as mentioned above, we

19

suppose it would be suitable for a transplant center, which contains many allo-HCT

data, to develop an in-house model for more accurate prognosis prediction. Therefore,

2

we provide the source codes, which will help each transplant institute to develop an

3

in-house web application for personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT and

4

assess its predictive performance. Second, as a retrospective analysis, this web

5

application may be susceptible to selection bias, which may limit the interpretation of

6

the prediction results. The predictive accuracy is unreliable in cases where

7

user-provided transplant settings were not included in the training cohort for model

8

development. Third, a different combination of pre-transplant factors might be

9

considered to develop a better predictive model. We restricted the number of

10

pre-transplant predictors to eight to ensure the usability of this web application tool.

11

These refined eight pre-transplant parameters could be easily and non-invasively

12

obtained at a low cost. However, there may be other combinations, including

13

molecular minimal residual disease, that are better for prognosis prediction.

14

Therefore, further studies are required.

15

In conclusion, we developed an interactive web application tool capable of plotting

16

four kinds of personalized prognosis prediction curves after allo-HCT objectively

17

through the integration of eight pre-transplant factors using RSF, and confirmed their

18

promising predictive performances. The predictive information obtained by this web

19

application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of
