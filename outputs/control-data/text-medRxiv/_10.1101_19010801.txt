Abstract
Background
Indoor air pollution (IAP) from solid fuels for cooking has been considered as a public health
threat, particularly for women and children in low- and lower-middle-income countries
(LMICs). We investigated the effects of solid fuel use (SFU) on neonatal, infant and underfive child mortality in Myanmar.

Materials and Methods
We used data from Myanmar’s first Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2016. The
sample consists of ever-married mothers with under-five children in the household (n=3249).
We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to investigate the effects of SFU on neonatal,
infant, and under-five mortality using multivariable logistic regression model accounting for
survey weight and clustering. Additional analysis was conducted using an augmented measure
of the exposure to IAP accounting for both SFU and the location of cooking (high exposure,
moderate, and unexposed).

Results
The prevalence of SFU was 79.0%, and the neonatal, infant and the under-five mortality rates
were 26, 45 and 49 per 1,000 live births, respectively. The odds of infant (aOR 2.17, 95% CI:
1.21, 3.88) and under-five child mortality (aOR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.95) were higher in
households with SFU compared with households with clean fuel use. When applying an
augmented measure of exposure to IAP by incorporating both SFU and the kitchen’s location,
the likelihood of infant and under-five mortality was higher among moderately and highly

exposed children compared to unexposed children with similar trends. Neonatal mortality was
not associated with both SFU and levels of exposure to IAP.

Conclusion
Infants and under-five children are at higher risk of mortality from exposure to IAP. The
findings suggest that the risk of infants and under-five child mortality may be reduced by
increasing access to clean cookstoves and clean fuels in LMICs, especially in Myanmar.

1. Background
Indoor air pollution (IAP) is one of the world's major environmental threats, causing about 4
million premature deaths annually (1). IAP related mortality is disproportionately higher in low
and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2017, almost 70% of all deaths related to IAP
occurred in LMICs (2). About 3 billion people use solid fuels for cooking, including coal and
biomass (wood, animal dung, lignite, charcoal, wood, straw/shrubs, grass, and agricultural
crop) (3,4), which are the major sources of IAP (1).

In contrast, alternative fuel (clean fuel) such as liquefied petroleum gas and electricity is often
unavailable and/or unaffordable in LMIC (5). Therefore, households opt to collect solid fuels
(3), which are burned indoors in conventional cookstoves as a pit, pieces of brick, or U-shaped
mud construction. These solid fuels emit damaging airborne pollutants, including PM10, NOx,
CO, SOx, formaldehyde and many toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic
matter due to inefficient combustion (6–8). The amount of exposure to an individual in such
settings has been measured to be much higher than the World Health Organization (WHO)
guidelines and standards (9).

In LMICs, women and children are at higher risk of exposure to SFU (10,11) due to women’s
role in household chores, cooking, and caring for infants in most South Asian culture. Women
spend about three to seven hours per day near the stove, sometimes carrying their infants for
care and warmth during cooking that leads children exposed to biomass fuel at similar levels
(3). This exposure level increases in households with limited ventilation and poor design of the
stove that do not have flues or hood to move out the smoke from living places (12).

The majority of the population in Myanmar use solid fuels for cooking as easy access to
biomass for domestic cooking is a convention (13). Clean Cooking Alliance, Myanmar
estimated that more than 95% of the rural and 88% of the urban population use solid fuels for
cooking, which might be one of the causes of more than 3,500 yearly infant and children death
from ALRIs and pneumonia in Myanmar (13,14). It could also be one of the reasons that
Myanmar could not achieve the Millennium Development Goals (between 2000 and 2015)
targets of reducing infant and child mortality (15). Importantly, this indicates an important area
to address for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of reducing neonatal (12 per
10000 live birth) and infant (25 per 10000 live births) deaths between 2015 and 2030.

No study, to our knowledge, has evaluated the effect of IAP from SFU on infant and underfive mortality rates using nationally representative data of Myanmar. The first Demographic
Health Survey (DHS) in Myanmar was conducted in 2016 that provides an opportunity for us
to examine the effect of SFU in the household on neonatal, infant and under-five mortality,
comparing the magnitude of the effect based on the exposure levels.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Study design
Given the focus on improving maternal and child health, Myanmar Demographic and Health
Survey (MDHS) 2016 was the first nationally representative survey conducted in Myanmar in
2015-16. Data were collected from 12,885 women from the sampled households based on
stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. Using the 2014 Myanmar census sampling units,
442 clusters (123 urban, 319 rural) were selected in the first stage from 4,000 clusters through
the probability proportional to the unit sizes. In the second stage, 30 households from each

selected cluster were selected in the first stage by using systematic random sampling. The
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded the DHS program, and
the Ministry of Health and Sports, Myanmar, implemented MDHS 2016. Three Millennium
Development Goals (a national level organization supported by the seven bilateral donors;
Australia, Denmark, the European Union, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States of America). Technical support was provided by the ICF international. Detail of
the survey sampling procedure has been published in the MDHS report (16).

2.2 Data Source
From 12,885 surveyed women, a sub-sample of 3,249 women were included in the analysis.
The inclusion criteria were: i) women had at least one child born within five years before the
date of survey; ii) respond to the question on survival status (alive/death at the time of survey)
of this child; iii) respond to the question about the date of child death if applicable; and iii)
respond to the question on household cooking fuels use.

2.3 Measures of Outcomes
We considered neonatal mortality (deaths occurred during the first 28 days of life), infant
mortality (deaths occurred during the first one year (0-11 months) of life), and under-five
mortality (deaths occurred during the first five years (0-59 months) of life) as outcome
variables.

2.4 Measures of Exposure to IAP
The analysis was carried out for two exposure variables: Solid Fuel Use (type of clean fuel vs.
solid fuel), and level of exposure to SFU induced IAP (unexposed, moderate exposure, and

high exposure). The MDHS collected information on the type of cooking fuel by asking
women, what type of fuel does your household mainly use for cooking? Responses were
recoded as clean fuel =0 (if responses were electricity, liquid petroleum gas, and natural gas)
and solid fuel =1 (if responses were coal, lignite, charcoal, wood, straw/shrubs, grass, and
agricultural crop). Children's levels of exposure to IAP was generated from the women's
responses to the place of cooking and the type of cooking fuel use. The responses were
categorized as unexposed =0 (if women reported not using solid fuel), moderate exposure =1
(if women reported using solid fuel, but in a separate building or outdoors), and high exposure
=2 (if women reported using solid fuel inside the house).

2.5 Confounder adjustment
Different sociodemographic factors that contribute to the neonatal, infant, and under-five
mortality were also included as confounders. These were age at child deaths, child sex,
women’s education, interval of last two succeeding births, household wealth quintiles,
urbanity, geographic regions, and seasons. The birth interval variable was generated based on
women’s response on the date of births of the last two-child and categorized by following the
World Health Organization guidelines (16). The wealth quintile was generated from the
women’s household durable and non-durable assets (e.g., televisions, bicycles, sources of
drinking water, sanitation facilities and construction materials of houses) using principal
components analysis.

2.6 Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the demographic profile of the respondents of
the study. Differences in occurring neonatal, infant and under-five deaths across

sociodemographic factors were also presented. The associations between exposure to IAP and
child mortality outcomes were investigated using both univariable and multivariable logistic
regression models. The univariable models included only the exposure variable and the
outcome variable. These associations were then adjusted for potential confounders in the
multivariable model. For each model, we used appropriate survey weights to adjust
stratification and cluster variations in the survey data. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR)
with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). All statistical tests were two-sided, and a p-value
< 0·05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out using statistical
software packages Stata version 15.1 (Stata Corp: College Station, TX, USA).

3. Results

3.1 Sample characteristics

Characteristics of sample, exposures, and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The mean (SD)
age of the mothers was 31(±6.0) years. The mean years of education was 4.43 (±3.5) years
(SD±3.5). The mean age of the child was 2.11(±0.04) months, and nearly 48% of the child was
female. More than three-quarter (77.8%) of the study households used solid fuel for cooking,
of which 61.5% used solid fuel inside the house. About two-thirds (64.5%) of the women’s
reported indoor place of cooking. Nearly half of the children and women (47.7%) were highly
exposed to indoor air pollution during the survey (Table 1).

mortality, and 2.17 % (aOR 95% CI: 1.21-3.88) higher likelihood of infant mortality for the
child of the women used solid fuel for cooking than women did not use solid fuel. The
likelihoods were even higher when we considered the augmented measure of exposure to IAP.
We found that the odds of occurring under-five mortality around 2.20 (95% CI: 1.19-4.06) and
2.25 (95% CI: 1.21-4.19) times higher among moderately and highly exposed children

4. Discussion

The risk factors of under-five child mortality, especially in the context of Myanmar, are underinvestigated despite their high child mortality rate. Additionally, no study, to our knowledge,
has examined the effect of IAP on child mortality in Myanmar. To address this gap, this study
examined the associations of SFU and exposure to IAP with neonatal, infant, and under-five
child mortality using first-ever nationally representative demographic and health survey data
collected in 2016.

Our study suggests that the under-five mortality rate was high (48 deaths per 1,000 live births)
in Myanmar. The majority of the households were dependent on SFU for cooking and heating
purposes, and almost half of the study children were highly exposed to IAP in Myanmar. The
study demonstrates that SFU and both moderate and high levels of exposure to IAP increased
the risk of infant and under-five child mortality in Myanmar.

Previous studies reported comparable results that SFU and exposure to IAP increase the risk
of infant and child mortality in LMICs (17–22). Evidence suggests that the combustion of SFU
emits multiple pollutants such as fine particles, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and many
more toxic chemicals, which increase the risk of mortality from ALRIs, asthma, and pneumonia
among infant and young children exposed to these pollutants (3,6,7,23–29). Exposure to these
toxic pollutants also increases the risk of low birth weight, stillbirth, and preterm birth,
including acute and chronic health problems, all of which are considered as leading causes of
child mortality (20,22,30,31).

Previous studies emphasized to consider cooking place along with SFU for examining the
association between IAP and child-mortality because cooking inside the house with solid fuels
maximizes the concentrations of airborne toxic pollutants in the household and ambient air
(20,23,32,33). Following the previous study, we employed an inclusive SFU exposure measure
combining both SFU and cooking place and found stronger associations of high exposure to
IAP with infant and child mortality (23). Consistent with our study, previous studies showed
that children were exposed to higher concentration of pollutants from SFU because of high
proximity to pollutants and spending much time in the kitchen during heating and cooking,
which intensifies the risk of child mortality from ALRI including other adverse health
outcomes (17,23,24). The plausible explanation is that infants at their early age are often carried

on their mother’s back or placed to sleep or stand beside their mother when they are cooking
because this is common practice in South-East Asian countries, including Myanmar
(20,21,32,34).

Furthermore, young children are more susceptible to IAP induced mortality compared to the
older child for their underdeveloped epithelial linings of the lungs (23,35). However, women
might be careful of IAP induced health effects on neonates. In a healthy condition, infants and
young children have higher respiration, and they breathe 50% more polluted air due to their
narrower airway and large lung surface. Also, children have a weak immune system in their
early years of life which makes them vulnerable to IAP induced mortality, especially from
ALRI (35–38).

However, neonatal mortality was not significantly associated with SFU and exposure to IAP,
and these results are consistent with previous research conducted in LMICs (17,39). Several
biological factors, such as low birth weight, prematurity, and complications associated with
pregnancy and delivery, might be responsible for the null association between IAP and neonatal
mortality (20,30,40). Additionally, breastfeeding could work as a protective factor diminishing
the effect of IAP on neonatal mortality. Moreover, neonates and mothers might live in a
conducive environment right after delivery, as well as mothers, usually stay away from any
cooking activities during the neonatal period, which is also a cultural practice in Asia.
However, few studies claim that neonates are at higher risk of IAP induced mortality and those
were inconsistent across studies (22,41).

Strength and weakness

The main strength of the study was based on the first-ever conducted a nationally representative
survey with 98% response rate. Moreover, the analysis of large-scale data with appropriate
statistical adjustments for confounders makes this study findings more reliable for
policymaking. The temporal association between IAP exposure and child mortality outcomes
cannot be established due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. Besides, the associations
could be affected by unmeasured confounders as well as different health outcomes such as
preterm birth, low birth weight, and other morbidity factors could be associated with underfive child mortality despite the exposure to IAP. Third, information related to birth and death
of the children was reported by mothers that may introduce recall bias, but it is unlikely that
the mother would incorrectly report the birth and death of their children. Fourth, there might
be a source of exposure measurement error as we used two proxy measures such as SFU and
combining SFU and cooking place to measure the associations between IAP exposures (23)
and under-five child mortality. However, this is the available robust and established
measurement of exposures for IAP because DHS does not objectively measure the level and
duration of IAP exposures (23,32). Further studies may include questions related to ventilation
in the kitchen, duration of cooking, proximity to the kitchen, or heating areas for the better
measurement of children’s exposure to IAP.

5. Conclusion

The study demonstrates that SFU is a significant risk factor for infant and under-five child
mortality but not for neonatal mortality. Furthermore, both moderate and high levels of
exposure to IAP, such as the combination of SFU and cooking inside the kitchen, increase the

risk of child mortality in Myanmar with a stronger effect among the children who had a high
level of exposure to IAP. Policymakers should take both short-term and long-term strategies
through socio-environmental pathways for addressing the problem of high child mortality rate
in Myanmar. The government could decrease child mortality in Myanmar by implementing
national policies related to clean fuels, cookstoves and green energy as well as reducing the
level of exposures to IAP, which will ultimately help them to meet several sustainable
development goals.
