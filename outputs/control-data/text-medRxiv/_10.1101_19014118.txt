Abstract
Background
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Recent
studies demonstrated low survival rates in Middle Eastern countries. Anecdotally there are
unique demographic, cultural and logistical challenges in this region. However, there remains
a paucity of data published on OHCA in the Middle East. In order to address OHCA in a
meaningful manner in the region, we first need to quantify the issue.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review of published and grey literature on OHCA in the Gulf
Cooperative Council region that utilised Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. Electronic
databases and grey literature sources were identified and searched. Subject matter experts in
the region were consulted. All types of studies in English and Arabic were included.
Results
A total of 24 studies were included from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar.
No literature was identified from the state of Bahrain. OHCA victims in the region are
younger, predominantly male, and more co-morbid than those in Western studies. We
observed low Emergency Medical Service utilisation, low bystander cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, return of spontaneous circulation, and survival to discharge rates across the
region. There are differences in characteristics of OHCA among ethnic groups.
Discussion and conclusions
We identified unique characteristics associated with OHCA in the region, variances in
processes and outcomes when compared to Western studies, and a lack of coordinated effort
to research and address OHCA. We recommend creating lead agencies responsible for
coordinating and developing strategies such as community response, public education, and
reporting databases.

Introduction
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of mortality worldwide, with variable
survival reported across countries and systems. In particular, Middle-Eastern and South Asian
countries report low survival rates1. Reported reasons for low OHCA survival in these
contexts include unique demographic, cultural, and logistical challenges related to the
management of OHCA. Such contexts may also present a challenge when we attempt to
implement evidence produced for the most part in Western systems. Characteristics and
outcomes of OHCA in Middle Eastern countries remains poorly researched, compounding
these challenges. The resulting lack of knowledge prevents us from understanding the issue,
and thereby prevents us from improving the issue. Thus, to meaningfully address OHCA in
the Middle East, we first need to understand the issue within its context.
Within the Middle East, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, also known
as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC, ‫ ) ا ون ا‬was established in 1981, and
comprises the governments of the states of the Kingdom of Bahrain, Kuwait, the Sultanate of
Oman, Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The
countries in the GCC are predominantly Islamic, and they share a common cultural and
historical background2. Another shared trait is their economic reliance on expatriate
workforces3, estimated at 48% of the total regional population of 53 million4,5. Within this
regional population life expectancy has risen dramatically since the 1960s to 77 years
(2017)5. However, increased population numbers, the healthcare needs of different
demographics and increased life expectancy have led to a rise in healthcare demands. This
rise is predominantly due to high rates of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and obesity, attributable to unhealthy lifestyles and a general lack of
coordinated public health programmes4,6. In order to reduce the risk associated with such
morbidity, the majority of GCC member countries have initiated public health strategies
which include the recording and reporting of non-communicable diseases
Sasser et al. first reported on out-of-hospital emergency care in Abu Dhabi in 20047, when
emergency medicine in the GCC was rudimentary at best. They observed no real medical
control, no treatment policies, a lack of training and education, and no quality assurance
policies, which echoed the situation across the region. However, emergency medicine and
prehospital care have developed across the GCC in the last 15 years. Reporting of OHCA
rates, response, and outcomes are also considered benchmarks of emergency medical
response readiness. As a result, we elected to conduct a review of OHCA studies in the GCC
in order to collectively summarise their characteristics and properties, as well as to identify
any gaps and areas for further research.

Methods and analysis
We conducted a scoping review, which enabled us to identify, map and present an overview
of a heterogeneous body of literature8,9. We deemed a scoping review to be appropriate given
the predicted lack of published data, the anticipated heterogeneity among studies and the

expected variability in reporting. We performed a systematic literature search for studies that
investigated OHCA in the GCC region. We utilised Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage
framework which included (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant
studies, (3) refining the study selection criteria, (4) collecting relevant data from each article,
and (5) collating, summarizing, reporting, and interpreting the results. We also implemented a
recommended additional stage, (6) consultation with experts. We reported our process
according to the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews10.
1. Identify the research questions
1. What are the characteristics of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases in the GCC region?
2. How do these studies differ from cases in Western countries which are predominantly
used to inform resuscitation guidelines?
3. What insights can be gained from these findings in order to better inform policy and
practice in the GCC region?
Ethics and dissemination
This is a scoping study of completed studies and hence no ethics approval was required.
2. Identify relevant studies
Systematic search
An information scientist (MA) developed the search strategy. We used this to search the
electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE from 1990 until
June 2019. The search strategy was modified accordingly for each database. Relevant nonindexed journals were identified and searched, and we performed multiple Google web and
Google Scholar searches. We searched the grey literature with guidance from the Grey
Matters checklist11. References of included studies were scanned for relevant articles. See
Appendix I for search terms and a list of non-indexed sources.
3. Select the studies
Eligibility criteria
Studies in English and Arabic were eligible for inclusion if they reported OHCA in the GCC.
We excluded studies that were not related to OHCA (e.g. in-hospital cardiac arrest), casereports, studies that reported only on traumatic OHCA, studies that were related to
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, and those not conducted in GCC countries.
Title and abstract screening
Initial screening comprised of a review of title and abstracts by two reviewers (AB and CL).
We resolved disagreements through discussion until consensus was achieved. Where
disagreement remained or there was insufficient evidence to make a decision, we included the
citation for full text review and subsequent decision.

4. Chart the data
To support the full-text review, we developed a standardised data extraction form to organize
information, confirm relevance, and to extract study characteristics (See Appendix II)12. The
information we collected included general study characteristics such as authorship, year of
publication, country, study design, sample size, outcomes measured, and OHCA
characteristics. We compiled all data into a single spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel 2013
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA) for analysis.
5. Collate, summarize, report and interpret
Data summary and synthesis
Due to variations in study designs, terminology used, and reporting conventions, it was
necessary to identify common areas for reporting summarised results. We selected a number
of demographic, process and outcome measures that reflect key components of effective
OHCA response and management. We abstracted and reported the findings for each measure
per study where possible, and we report on them under the headings of characteristics,
process and outcomes measures.
Critical appraisal
In line with the scoping review framework, we did not conduct a critical appraisal8.
6. Consultation (optional stage)
In addition to our own experience and expertise with OHCA in the region, we conferred with
a number of OHCA subject matter experts (SMEs) in the GCC, and invited them to
contribute additional materials and unpublished studies. Two of these individuals
subsequently joined the research team (DA and AA).

Results
Search results and study selection
The search yielded 590 citations. We identified an additional 57 citations through searches of
grey literature and hand searching. After elimination of duplicates, we screened 284 citations
at the title and abstract level. This led to the exclusion of 236 citations. After full-text review
of 48 citations, we included 24 full-texts for data extraction and analysis. See Fig 1 for an
illustration of these findings using PRISMA Diagram, Appendix III for details of adult
OHCA studies, and Appendix IV for details of paediatric OHCA studies.

Characteristics of included studies
Included studies were published between 1999 and 2019. Studies comprised full-text articles
(both published and unpublished manuscripts) (n=16), technical reports or theses (n=3),
conference abstracts (n=3), and letters to the editor (n=2). Studies were from the UAE
(n=10), Qatar (n=6), Saudi Arabia (n=4), Kuwait (n=3), Oman (n=1), and the region (n=1).
We did not identify any literature from the state of Bahrain despite consultation with an SME
in the country. A total of 20 studies described adult cases or all cases of OHCA. Four studies
specifically or independently described paediatric OHCA and we reported these separately in
our results; Conroy (1999)13 is reported as both an adult and a paediatric OHCA study.

Adult OHCA victims in the GCC region were consistently younger, predominantly male, and
more co-morbid than their counterparts in Western studies. Most OHCA cases occurred at
home (ranging from 54% to 85% of all OHCA cases), consistent with international
findings14. See Table 1, Fig 2 and Fig 3 for further characteristics, and Appendix III for full

details.

We observed differences in the characteristics of OHCA among ethnic groups in the region
(e.g. Arab, South Asian and North African). For example, compared to GCC patients, South
Asian and North African patients were more likely to smoke, but had lower levels of
comorbidities18,23. Despite this, South Asian and North African patients were generally
younger, and accounted for a large percentage of total OHCA cases in a number of
studies17,19,22, possibly attributable to population demographics.

Process and outcome characteristics
We observed low levels of EMS utilisation, low bystander CPR rates, low return of
spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rates, and lower survival to hospital discharge rates across
the region when compared to Western studies. EMS utilization rates were rarely reported, and
ranged from 1.4%24 to 31%21. Bystander CPR (bCPR) rates ranged from 5.1%13 to 30%19.
Bystander AED (bAED) rates were reported at under 2% for any study which reported such
data. ROSC rates ranged from 1.6%16 to 39.4%24 while most studies reported ROSC rates
under 10%. Survival to hospital discharge rates were often not reported, and ranged from
2%16 to 40.2%24; however, most studies reported rates under 10%. See Fig 4 for information
on process and outcome results.

Characteristics of paediatric OHCA cases
A small number (4) of paediatric OHCA (POHCA) studies were identified. Despite the
limitations associated with such a small number of studies, we report them here nonetheless
in order to provide some collective insight into POHCA in the GCC. POHCA victims in the
GCC region were predominantly male, and a significant percentage were due to non-medical
aetiologies (23.5%-45%), including drowning. Most POHCA cases occurred at home,
ranging from 36%29 to 87%30 of all POHCA cases. Despite this, and similar to adult OHCA
findings, we observed low levels of bystander CPR. See Table 1, Fig 5 and Fig 6 for further
characteristics, and Appendix IV for full details.

5.9%31 and 14%29. Two studies reported a survival to discharge rate of approximately 6%13,31.
Pre-existing medical conditions were reported for POHCA patients in several studies and
varied from 23.5%31 to almost 70%30. See Fig 7 for information on process and outcome
results for POHCA.

Discussion
The causes of lower OHCA survival in the GCC are anecdotally related to unique
demographic, cultural and logistical contexts of the region. Given these challenges, and the
lack of synthesized literature, we sought to describe and explore OHCA in the GCC via a
scoping review methodology. Included studies reported low out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
survival to discharge rates (1-13%) when compared to Western studies (e.g. 10-23% reported
in Gräsner32). After we examined studies from multiple countries in the GCC region, we
suggest several unique characteristics are associated with OHCA in the region; variances
exist in both OHCA processes and outcomes when compared to Western studies; and, despite
the mortality associated with OHCA in the region it remains poorly researched, with an
observed lack of coordinated effort to improve process and outcomes.
Unique characteristics of OHCA in the region
OHCA victims in the GCC are younger, predominantly male, and more co-morbid than their
counterparts in Western studies. We suggest a number of reasons for these findings. One
proposed cause for the observed increase in cardiac conditions is oil wealth–induced
“obesogenic urbanization” that has occurred rapidly in the region33. A number of studies in
our review reported high rates of cardiac risk factors including diabetes mellitus,

hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, chronic renal failure, and acute coronary syndrome
18,19,23,24,26,28,34
. Additionally, the high rate of expatriate populations living in some GCC
17,19,22
countries
, and their unique lifestyle risk factors (such as high rates of smoking) may
have contributed to the observed young age and male dominance of OHCA cases in our
review. We also observed differences in OHCA demographics in these populations compared
to the national populations. For example, expatriates were normally younger, and more likely
to smoke compared to locals18,23.
Variances in pre-hospital resuscitation processes and outcomes
Cardiac arrest cases in public places have generally demonstrated better outcomes in Western
studies, likely due to an increased rate of witnessed arrests, early activation of EMS and early
provision of bystander CPR and AED. Existing evidence acknowledges this portion of care
prior to EMS arrival is crucial in OHCA outcomes, i.e. recognising OHCA, calling for help
and providing bystander CPR and AED35,36. We observed lower levels of EMS utilisation
(reported in 2 studies; range 1.4-35%), lower bystander CPR rates (reported in 10 studies;
range 3-30%), and very low bystander AED rates in the studies included in our review.
Variation in response times, and a noteworthy absence of integrated community response
systems means that mortality from OHCA in the GCC likely occurs on scene. These findings
highlight a significant weakness in the early access and public response to OHCA in the
region. Anecdotal reasons for such challenges in the GCC include a lack of defibrillators in
public places, “Good Samaritan” laws that stipulate only certified people should provide
medical assistance, lack of governing bodies to oversee all aspects of medical emergency
response, rurality, and cultural norms19. Cultural challenges include a lack of knowledge of
CPR, a lack of confidence to intervene, and barriers to CPR and AED use, especially on
female OHCA patients37. We also observed over-reliance on private transport rather than
EMS to transport OHCA patients, mirroring results in non-OHCA studies in the region38.
Attempts to address such challenges are yielding results, as evidenced in the reported
increased use of EMS for OHCA17,19,20; however, public perceptions related to recognising
and intervening in OHCA remain unstudied in the GCC.
Elsewhere, developing integrated community response models has yielded significant
improvements in OHCA measures. The Republic of Ireland is a good exemplar, and it shares
characteristics of rurality in common with GCC countries39,40, despite their obvious
geographical differences. In 2018 national figures for Ireland (OHCA n=2,442) were reported
as: 81% bCPR (excluding EMS witnessed cases), 22% bAED, 26% ROSC and 7.2% (n=176)
survival to discharge, the majority with cerebral performance score of 1 or 241. These results
represent significant improvements when compared to national figures from only five years
prior (n=1,885): 69% bCPR (excluding EMS witnessed cases), 16% bAED, 23% ROSC and
6% survival to discharge (n=120)42. In that five year period, Ireland further developed a
national network of integrated community response schemes, focused on the provision of
early CPR, including dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR). As a result, continued
improvements in OHCA measures are likely to be realised in the future. Due to the
challenges we observed in this review in relation to access to EMS, bCPR, bAED, and

cultural and logistical barriers, we observed low ROSC rates, and subsequent low levels of
survival to hospital discharge across the region. In other words, lower survival as an outcome
is reflective of process issues in the resuscitation attempt, particularly in the pre-arrival phase.
Lack of research and coordinated effort
The processes and outcomes related to OHCA are well-researched in Western countries, in
part due to established, coordinated cardiac arrest registries. These may be national (e.g.
OHCAR in Ireland40) or regional (e.g. EuReCa in Europe32), and they allow researchers to
examine trends, correlations and concerns related to OHCA with large prospectivelycollected datasets. Another example is the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study
(PAROS25), an international cardiac arrest registry study of which the UAE is a reporting
member. Our review also demonstrated that OHCA research efforts are sporadic across the
GCC, and even within countries, such research efforts are not strategically coordinated. For
example, none of the existing UAE PAROS-member studies reported on OHCA in the
Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and thus these publications do not present a complete account of
OHCA in the UAE. The heterogeneity of populations within PAROS across Asia and the
Middle East presents a challenge when we attempt to utilise it as a solution for the GCC34. In
some GCC countries, OHCA outcomes remain unknown due to a complete lack of reporting.
Despite a previous call for a regional initiative for data collection and sharing43, there has
been no concerted effort to create OHCA reporting databases in the GCC. As a result of this
lack of coordinated effort, we cannot provide scientific answer to research questions, which
creates a barrier to evidence-informed policy and decision making in the GCC. Additionally,
the provision of public education, coordination of public information campaigns, bystander
and community response to OHCA, strategic planning of emergency medical response, and
the coordination of research efforts are (where they exist) spread across multiple local or
national agencies within each country. This may lead to a lack of coordinated effort in
relation to the management of OHCA. Without such strategic oversight, there is potential for
duplication of effort, missed opportunities, and lack of compatibility, both within and
between countries in the region.
Recommendations

The low OHCA survival rates and characteristics observed in our review highlight the
regional challenges when we attempt to implement existing OHCA management strategies
produced by Western systems. Regional challenges include pre-existing morbidity of
patients, immigrant populations, unclear “Good Samaritan” laws, low levels of EMS
utilisation, lack of AED response, low bystander CPR rates, cultural challenges, and an
unknown OHCA recognition rate. As a result, the traditional cardiac arrest ‘chain of survival’
faces challenges as a ‘one size-fits all’ strategy within the region due to such differences in
context. Therefore countries within the GCC region may need to customise their
implementation of accepted OHCA management strategies to reflect cultural, logistical and
demographical variations. To inform such approaches, it is first necessary to highlight
regional OHCA characteristics, identify potential OHCA management challenges, and
subsequently propose areas for consideration and improvement. Based on our review, we

provide several recommendations to reduce the OHCA burden in the region (see Textbox 1),
largely reflective of the recommendations of the Global Resuscitation Alliance44. In the first
instance, and essential in order to implement additional recommendations, we recommend
that a lead agency should be established within each country to coordinate and manage
OHCA response within the community. This agency should advocate for the passing of
"Good Samaritan Law" equivalents within the region to encourage and protect community
responders and bystanders, and may provide leadership on the integration of trained
responder dispatch systems45,46. This agency would continue to develop EMS response, in
particular through the creation of integrated community response models, and the provision
of DA-CPR to improve OHCA process and outcome measures. Community response models
empower the local community, and may work to alleviate cultural barriers and the increased
response times associated with rurality. Additionally, advocating for uniform emergency
numbers, coordinated dispatch centres, and compatible EMS system designs are essential
components of early recognition and response in OHCA47,48.
Public health initiatives should be developed and implemented (or continued where already
present) to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, and
preventable trauma in paediatrics, including drowning. We also recommend targeted public
health interventions aimed at improving public health concerns highlighted in expatriate
populations. Additionally, in light of the proportion of OHCA that occurred at home in the
region (similar to Western studies), the lead agency should implement widespread
information campaigns through various media, that inform the public on the existence of
“Good Samaritan Law” equivalents, the importance of early OHCA recognition, how to
access EMS, and the importance of early CPR (which can be further supported via provision
of DA-CPR). Furthermore, the lead agency should promote improved access to AEDs in
public places that have high incidence of OHCA49, as well as develop and maintain a national
registry of publicly accessible AEDs50. This focus on improved care prior to EMS arrival is
crucial in improving OHCA outcomes in GCC countries35. Finally, in order to improve our
understanding of OHCA in the region, we advocate for the creation of a reporting database
within each GCC country, and a further cooperative database within the region. The lead
agency for each country should oversee the development of such a registry, which will enable
continued research into the characteristics and management of OHCA in the region. Such
databases should align with international data collection and reporting conventions to
facilitate data sharing and collaboration51.
Limitations
Our findings need to be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. We may not have
identified all relevant studies despite our attempts to be comprehensive. Our search and
review was restricted to articles published in English and Arabic, but this does not inherently
bias a review52. The Google Scholar searches were limited to the first 300 results which is
considered adequate for grey literature searches53. Further grey literature sources may exist
that we did not identify; however, we attempted to minimize this risk by using the GreyMatters Checklist11, contacting SMEs in the region, and searching non-indexed sources. A

number of studies included data on presumed cardiac aetiology as well as traumatic OHCA.
We attempted to identify and report only non-traumatic OHCA data where possible, but this
was not always possible. We noted in our data where we were able to perform this. Finally,
there are a limited number of POHCA studies in our review. Despite these limitations, we
propose that our review offers the first comprehensive overview of OHCA in the GCC
region.
Textbox 1. Summary of recommendations.

1. Create a lead agency in each country for strategic oversight of OHCA preparedness,
response, management and research
2. Develop community response models, including dispatcher-assisted CPR, and
community responder dispatch models
3. Advocate for the legislation of ‘Good Samaritan Law’ equivalents
4. Implement (or continue) public health initiatives to reduce risk factors, including
cardiac related health checks for immigrant populations
5. Coordinate widespread public information campaigns related to recognition and
management of OHCA, early EMS access, and early CPR
6. Improve access to AEDs in high-risk locations, and create national AED registries
7. Establish and maintain OHCA registries in each country and the GCC region which
align with international conventions

Conclusion
Our review is the first to collate and comprehensively report data on OHCA in the GCC
region. We highlighted unique demographic traits, and challenges related to OHCA processes
and outcomes in the region. We also acknowledged where countries have implemented
strategies to address OHCA, and process and outcome measures are improving. Finally,
despite the significant burden associated with OHCA in the region, we observed a concerning
lack of research and a lack of coordinated effort. In order to address these concerns, we
recommend the creation of lead agencies responsible for coordinating and developing OHCA
strategies. Such strategies may include implementing community response models including
dispatcher-assisted CPR, advocating for “Good Samaritan Law” equivalents, coordinating
mass public education campaigns targeted at cultural and logistical issues, supporting public
health risk-reduction initiatives, and establishing OHCA reporting databases.
