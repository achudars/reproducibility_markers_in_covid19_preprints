Introduction
In

realm of

scientific

research,

study

results

should be

made available

and

accessible to the broader research community to assess the evidence around the

and

of

interventions.[1]

Emanuel

et

framework defines seven ethical guidelines for clinical research involving human
subjects.[2]

The

from

results as “Only if society will gain knowledge, which requires sharing
results, whether positive or negative, can exposing human subjects to risk in clinical
research be justified”.

A number of studies have examined the ramification of publication bias and debated
a number of contributing factors to non-publication of clinical trial results such as
recruitment challenges, funding sources and study design.[3-10] Other challenges

The

notion

of

clinical

trial

registration

was

conceived

in

1986,

when

Simes

suggested that the act of registration would help control the risk of publication bias
by providing a new data source for trial information and results.[13-15] The trial

Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) introduced a new mandate to promote prompt
registration of all clinical trials.[22] In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO)
started an

initiative to standardize

trial

registrations and

trial registry

datasets

across multiple national and international registries.[23] In October 2008, the 7th
revision of the Declaration of Helsinki was adopted with new requirements focusing
on the importance of prospective registration of clinical trials and reporting of their
results.[24] The prospective registration of clinical trial means that investigators
should register their trials prior to the enrollment date of the first trial participant,
otherwise, the registration would be considered retrospective. In 2015, the WHO
announced a new statement on public disclosure of clinical trial results with more
guidelines on trial registration, publication of results, and the inclusion of the trial

Two studies reported publication rates between 66% and 68% for clinical trials
registered in the US-based clinical trials registry, ClinicalTrials.gov.[27,29] Another
study reported publication rates at 73% for clinical trials registered in at least one
of several clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, WHO
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinical Study Register, and Indian,

and

prospective registration of digital health clinical trials. We sought to examine, at the
global level, the non-publication and prospective trial registration rates in digital
health trials across the seventeen WHO ICTRP registries.

Research Objectives
The primary research objective was to examine the prospective trial registration
and publication rates of digital health randomized clinical trials registered in any
registry that is part of the WHO ICTRP registries. The secondary research objectives
were (1) to investigate the compliance with recruitment and inclusion of the TRN in
the published trials, (2) to explore the relationship between publication rates, the

as

of

We

utilized the advanced search functionality on the ICTRP search portal to apply our
86 search terms and phrases including all trial phases and recruitment status. There
were 22,859 unique trials that matched our search terms, within which, 15,096
trials were randomized, and 1,018 trials were enrolled in 2012. After screening
against our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 417 trials were included, and 601 trials
were excluded as per the following breakdown:

Discussion
The primary objectives of this study were to examine the non-publication rate and
prospective registration of digital health randomized clinical trials registered in any
of the seventeen WHO ICTRP registries. A total of 417 randomized clinical trials met
our

inclusion

criteria,

were

in

forty

different

countries,

and

were

registered

in

eleven trial registries.
We found that 34.5% of all included trials remain unpublished six years after the
enrollment

of

trial

participants.

Nearly

half

of

our

included

trials

56.1%

were

registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, of which 36.3% remain unpublished.
Our non-publication rate was higher compared to a 2018 study that reported 27%
non-publication

rate

for

digital

health

trials

registered

in

ClinicalTrials.gov.[60]

Although both studies focused on examining non-publication rates in digital health
trials, their study design, data source and approach were quite different, hence a
direct

of

the

seventeen WHO registries. The former 2018 study included 556 trials that were
registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry only and were completed within three
years, between 2010 and 2013.[60]
Our finding is also higher than that reported in another study with a non-publication
rate at 29% for large randomized clinical trials, i.e. trials with at least 500 enrolled
participants.[3] Other studies reported that nearly half of the included trials were
not

published,

which

is

considerably

higher

than

our

own

findings.[1,4,28]

To

explain these differences in non-publication rates, we postulate that the rapidly
evolving

technology

elements

of

digital

health

trials

could

introduce

extrinsic

motivation to investigators to publish their results and stay ahead of the technology
innovation curve.
Our results also showed that the vast majority 96.6% of digital health trials are
funded by non-industry sponsors, such as universities, hospitals, medical institutes
and research centers, that are more disciplined and obliged by scholarly ethics to
publish their results. We speculate that industry sponsors would be more interested
in the broader opportunity in the digital health marketplace beyond the realm of
academia and best practices of randomized trials design.
We

found

statistically

significant

relationships

between

prospective

trial

registration and their funding sources. The lowest compliance with prospective trial
registration was at 14.3% for industry-funded trials. In contrast to our present
study, other studies assessing the prospective registration of clinical trials found
that industry funded trials were more likely to be compliant with prospective trial
registration

compared

to

non-industry-funded

trials.[61-70]

However,

we

also

found that only 14 (3.4%) trials of the included 417 trials were industry-funded
which may limit the generalizability of our finding in comparison to other studies.
For the 273 trials with identified publication in our study, the compliance in trial

with recruitment than larger trials. We suspect that it would be easier to adequately
recruit,

and

of

smaller

trials

with

a

logistical,

operational and feasibility advantages over larger trials. We also found that trials
funded by university sponsors were 1.5 times more compliant with trial recruitment
compared

to

by

any

other

sponsors.

This

finding

indicates

that

investigators of university sponsored trials are exceling at adopting best practices
and strategies in trial design to improve participant recruitment, which is to be
expected within the academic context of the university sponsors.

Retrospective Registration of Digital Health Clinical Trials
Despite the emphasis on prospective trial registration introduced by the 2004 ICMJE
mandate and the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki, we found that only 38.4% of all
included trials were registered prospectively.[22,24] Similar findings were reported
by

two

independent

studies

indicating

that

compliance

with

prospective

trial

registration was at 31%.[75,76] We hypothesize that investigators may be more
inclined, or biased, to registering their trial only when submitting their results to
peer-reviewed journals for publication.

Selective Registration Bias of Digital Health Clinical Trials
We found a statistically significant relationship (P<.001)

between

retrospective

registration and the registration-to-publication duration in digital health clinical
trials, for which we coined a new term as “Selective Registration Bias”, or simply
“Registration Bias”.
Within

our

sample

of

273

published

trials,

the

vast

majority

95.7%

of

trials

registered within one year before publication were registered retrospectively. Our
results showed that investigators, who did not register their trials promptly prior to
enrollment,

were

required

or

motivated

to

do

so

only

when

they

submit

their

results to scholarly journals. There may be a number of contributing factors to this
selective

registration

bias.

Firstly,

the

investigator

may

have

deferred

the

trial

registration task until the completion of the trial and only when the results are
finalized and ready to be published. Secondly, the investigator may also be not
aware of

the

ethical

expectation to

register

their

trial

promptly.

Lastly,

journal

editors and peer-reviewers are likely to suggest registration of the submitted trial
publication prior to accepting the publication submission. It’s important to establish
and

broaden

the

adoption

of

prompt

trial

registration

requirement

in

ethical

approval and guidelines of clinical trial design at the institutional and academic
level.

oncology trials at 63.2%. The significantly higher underreporting of oncology trial
results suggests challenges in conducting oncology studies in the realm of digital
health trials. These challenges may align with other studies indicating a number of
barriers to conducting traditional oncology trials including eligibility, recruitment,
follow-ups, and oncologist and patient attitudes.[62-64] However, we postulate that
there may be a few other challenges that are specific to digital health oncology trials,
particularly in the recruitment and enrollment stage of those trials. These explicit
barriers may be explained by the treating oncologist, or patient, preferences to
enroll in other non-digital health trials, such as experimental drug trials, with more
measurable clinical outcomes. The results from our study validate this postulate
through two distinct data points. First, we found only one oncology trial in our study
that was funded by a pharmaceutical sponsor, indicating the lack of interest from
pharmaceutical sponsors to invest in digital health trials. Second, we reported the
lowest recruitment compliance rate for oncology trials at 42.9%, which is a clear
indicator to enrollment barriers to digital health oncology trials.

Compliance with Prospective Trial Registration in The Australian New Zealand Clinical
Trials Registry (ANZCTR)
The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) leads with 89.7%
compliance with prospective trial registration. Also, trials from Australia and New
Zealand were leading with 89.5% compliance with prospective trial registration
(the 0.2 percent decline is due to one trial that was registered in the ANZCTR
registry and was not located in Australia or New Zealand). The high compliance with
prospective trial registration in the ANZCTR registry was acknowledged by another
study indicating an incremental trend in prospective trial registration from 48% to
63% for trials registered in the ANZCTR registry between 2006 and 2012.[61]

Recruitment Compliance in the Middle East
Digital health trials in the Middle East had the lowest non-publication rate and the
highest recruitment compliance at 26.7% and 81.1% respectively. These results
were driven by Iranian trials registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials
(IRCT). Compared to other WHO registries in our study, the IRCT trials had the
lowest non-publication rate and the highest recruitment compliance at 25% and
88.9% respectively. Several studies reported to the legacy of the IRCT and its role in
upholding best practices and ethical guidelines in the field of clinical research in
Iran.[65-67] However, we found that prospective trial registration was the lowest at
8.3% for trials registered in the IRCT. Our results support findings from another
study that reported on the rationale behind the low prospective trial registration
rate at 8.3% for trials registered in the IRCT between 2008 and 2011.[68] All trials
registered in the IRCT were funded by university sponsors. This finding aligns with
another study that analyzed all trials registered in the IRCT until the end of 2015

that inclusion of the TRN in respective trial publications was the lowest for trials

22.2%.

Combined

with

the

lowest

registration of those trials, we postulate that investigators of trials registered in the
IRCT

may

be

unaware

of

the

ICMJE

recommendation

for

prospective

registration and the WHO re-affirmation to include the TRN in the trial publication
to

enable

the

easy

between

the

and

of

the

respective trial.

Recruitment Compliance in Low and Middle-Income Countries
We found significant differences (P=.002) in the relationship

between recruitment

compliance and trial location. We grouped Asia, the Middle East and the Americas
without the U.S. as low and middle-income countries, and grouped high-income
countries as Europe, U.S., Australia and New Zealand. The average compliance with
trial

recruitment

in

low

and

middle-income

countries

was

at

51%,

which

is

significantly higher than that in high-income countries at 30%. The significantly
higher compliance in trial recruitment in low and middle-income countries may be
explained by differences in clinical, regulatory, and economical standards in these
countries, such as (1) access to a large population of potential trial participants
(often with lower socioeconomic status and medical literacy), (2) lower cost of
research resources, (3) less enforced, or developed, regulatory standards, and (4) if
participation

in

a

trial

would

provide

access

to,

otherwise

unavailable

or

unaffordable, medical care for the participants.[73,74,82] These differences raise
ethical concerns in conducting clinical trials in these countries. These concerns are
best described in article 20 of the Declaration of Helsinki emphasizing on the ethics
in

participant

recruitment,

and

on

the

relevance

and

tangible

benefits

of

the

research outcomes to the participants population.[24,82] Local regulatory agencies,
and ethics committees in low and middle-income countries need to be cautious
about these ethical concerns and ensure the scientific integrity of digital health trials
in their respective countries.

Adherence to Best Practices in Clinical Trials from Europe
Europe was the region with the largest number of digital health trials in our study.
European trials constituted 182(43.6%) of our included trials, and had the highest
compliance with the inclusion of the TRN at 68.7%, and the second lowest nonpublication rate at 28% tied with the Middle East. The overall lead in European
trials

is

influenced

by

strong

demonstrated

by

the

investigators of digital health trials in the Netherlands. The Netherlands National
Trial Register (NTR) had the second lowest non-publication rate at 25%, and the
highest

the

that

indicated

that

the

compliance with reporting the TRN in respective trial publications was at 60%.[69]

Time to Publication
The majority (88.3%) of the published trials in our study were published within five
years after enrollment. Our finding is comparable to the results of a 2007 study

indicating that trials with positive results were published within five years after
enrollment and trials with negative results were published in six to eight years.[43]
We postulated that small trials would be easier to conduct as they have fewer
recruitment and enrollment challenges, hence they would likely be completed and
published in a shorter time compared to large trials. To validate our postulate, we

P=.002),

analyzed the relationship, and found statistically significant differences (

between trial size and enrollment-to-publication duration. We observed a reversed
trend in publication between large and small trials at the fourth-year mark after
trial enrollment. Small trials published their results 1.3 times more than large trials
within the first four years after enrollment, after which large trials published their
results 2.2 times more than small trials. This trend is likely driven by the longer
amount of time required for the investigator of the larger trials to complete the
enrollment and intervention for a larger group of participants.

Limitations
Our study is the first to our knowledge that analyzed global digital health clinical
trials registered in all the WHO recognized trial registries.[26] Our study did not
consider

any

other

registries

that

are

not

part

of

the

seventeen

WHO

primary

registries, such as the federal office of public health’s portal for human research in
Switzerland, and the Philippine health research registry.[78,79] We acknowledge
that not considering trials registries other than the WHO primary registries may
have impacted the external validity of our study results.
Despite the ICMJE and WHO emphasis on trial registration, not all randomized trials
are registered.[73,76] We did not include unregistered trials in our analysis, which
may impact the internal validity of our study results.
We

included

trials

that

are

registered

and

started

the

enrollment in

2012.

We

considered the enrollment and/or trial start date as provided in the registration
information of the included trials. The registration information is provided manually
and voluntarily by the registering investigators who are often overwhelmed with
competing priorities and limited resources. Therefore, the enrollment date provided
in the trial registries may not always be up-to-date or maintained promptly.
Lastly,

our

study

only

included

registered

trials

enrolled

in

2012.

Our

findings

predate the recent 2015 WHO calls for improving public disclosure of trial results
and the linkages between these results and the respective trial registry entries.[25]

Conclusion
In the field of digital health randomized clinical trials, the adherence of investigators
to the best practices of trial registration and result dissemination is still evolving.
We analyzed digital health randomized clinical trials that were registered in the
seventeen WHO recognized trials and started their enrollment in 2012. Within our
included 417 trials, non-publication rate and retrospective trial registration were
prevalent at 34.5% and 61.6% respectively. Our study indicated low compliance
rate with recruitment and inclusion of the TRN in publication of the 273 trials, with
identified publication, at 59.3% and 52% respectively. It would be advisable for the
research community, from research ethics boards to journal editorial boards, to
promote and advocate for better adherence to trial publication and registration. In

We included trials irrespective of their recruitment status or trial phases. We limited our
inclusion criteria to trials that started in 2012. We considered the enrollment date in the
trial registries to indicate the start date of the included trials.

Enrollment Date Justification
We aimed to allow for longer publication cycles to account for late publications of
included trials. We reviewed existing studies that reported that investigators of
clinical trials may take up to three years to complete their trials and another two to
three

years

before

they

would

publish

their

results.[27,40-42]

A

2007

study

indicated that clinical trials with positive results were published four to five years

Data Extraction
We downloaded the XML files for the 417 matching clinical trials in the ICTRP
search portal. We transformed these files into a tabular format and imported them
into a local SQL Server Database for further data preparation and analysis.

Conditions
The content of the condition field in the ICTRP dataset is a free-text description of
the trial conditions. We were able to consolidate a total of 375 unique condition
descriptions of the 417 included trials to 5 distinct condition groups as described in
Appendix II - Classification of Trials Condition Groups.

Prospective Trial Registration
The data export from the ICTRP dataset did include a field to indicate whether a trial
was registered retrospectively.[44,45] However, our analysis showed that this field

Identification of Randomized Trials
We were able to identify randomized trials through a text match search in the
following three fields in the data export from the ICTRP dataset: “Study_design,”
“Public_title,” and “Scientific_title”. We searched for matching words that included
the term ‘Random’ and did not include the term ‘Non-Random’.
