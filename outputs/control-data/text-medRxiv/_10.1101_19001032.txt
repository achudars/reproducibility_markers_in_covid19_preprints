ABSTRACT

10

Current guidelines recommend BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing for individuals with a

11

personal or family history of certain cancers. Three BRCA1/2 founder variants — 185delAG

12

(c.68_69delAG), 5382insC (c.5266dupC), and 6174delT (c.5946delT) — are common in the

13

Ashkenazi Jewish population. We characterized a cohort of more than 2,800 research

14

participants in the 23andMe database who carry one or more of the three Ashkenazi Jewish

15

founder variants, evaluating two characteristics that are typically used to recommend individuals

16

for BRCA testing: self-reported Jewish ancestry and family history of breast, ovarian, prostate,

17

or pancreatic cancer. Of the 1,967 carriers who provided self-reported ancestry information,

18

21% did not self-report any Jewish ancestry; of these individuals, more than half (62%) do have

19

detectable Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry. In addition, of the 343 carriers who provided

20

both ancestry and family history information, 44% did not have a first-degree family history of a

21

BRCA-related cancer and, in the absence of a personal history of cancer, would therefore be

22

unlikely to qualify for clinical genetic testing. These findings provide support for the growing call

23

for broader access to BRCA genetic testing.

MAIN TEXT

28

BACKGROUND

29

Pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are linked to an increased risk for female

30

breast and ovarian cancer (including early-onset breast cancer), male breast cancer, prostate

31

cancer, pancreatic cancer, and certain other cancers [1]. These variants are highly penetrant:

32

Women with a variant have a 45-85% chance of developing breast cancer and up to a 46%

33

chance of developing ovarian cancer by age 70 [2]. However, increased surveillance and

34

prophylactic surgery (mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy) can greatly reduce the risk of

35

breast and ovarian cancer in women carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation [3].

36
37

The prevalence of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants is estimated to be between 1 in 300

38

and 1 in 800 in the general population [1,2]. Among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent,

39

three BRCA1/2 founder variants — 185delAG (c.68_69delAG), 5382insC (c.5266dupC), and

40

6174delT (c.5946delT) — are present at a frequency of ~1 in 40 [1].

41
42

Current U.S. guidelines limit BRCA1/2 genetic testing to individuals with a personal or family

43

history of a relevant cancer, including early-onset breast cancer, multiple primary breast

44

cancers, ovarian cancer, and certain other cancers [1,2,4]. In addition, Ashkenazi Jewish

45

ancestry is sometimes used to recommend screening for individuals with a personal or family

46

history of a single breast cancer at any age [1]. However, recent studies have found that about

47

50% of BRCA carriers have little or no family history of a relevant cancer [5-8]. These

48

individuals would likely not qualify for clinical genetic testing unless they developed cancer

49

themselves, representing a missed opportunity for cancer prevention. Because BRCA variants

50

predispose to very high breast and ovarian cancer risks even among carriers without a family

51

history [5,9], these findings have spurred calls for broader access to BRCA genetic testing,

52

among Ashkenazi Jews and in the general population [5-7,10,11].

53
54

The 23andMe database provides an ethnically diverse, generally unselected group of

55

genotyped individuals. We sought to characterize a cohort of individuals who carry one or more

56

of the three Ashkenazi Jewish founder variants as related to two characteristics that are typically

57

used to recommend individuals for BRCA testing: self-reported Jewish ancestry and family

58

history of breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer. We focused on these two

59

characteristics because they can enable individuals to learn their BRCA status before

60

developing cancer, thus providing opportunities for cancer prevention and/or early detection.

61
62

METHODS

63

Consented participants were drawn from the customer base of 23andMe. Data on Jewish

64

ancestry and family cancer history were collected by self-report via online surveys. See

65

Declarations for informed consent and protocol details; see Supplementary Information for

66

survey questions. Analyses were run on phenotypic data collected before October 10, 2017.

67
68

DNA extraction and genotyping were performed on saliva samples by CLIA-certified and CAP-

69

accredited clinical laboratories of Laboratory Corporation of America. Samples were genotyped

70

on one of four custom Illumina genotyping arrays: the HumanHap550+ Bead chip (two

71

versions), the OmniExpress+ Bead chip, or a fully custom array; see [12] for additional details.

72

Proportions of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry were estimated via an analysis of local

73

genetic ancestry as described in [13]. To account for imprecision in genetic ancestry estimates,

74

we characterized estimates of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry <1% as "not detectable."

91
92

One possible explanation for the large fraction of carriers who did not report Jewish ancestry is

93

that they were unaware of their Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. To test this hypothesis, we explored

94

the relationship between self-reported ancestry and genetic ancestry. As expected, individuals

95

with a greater proportion of estimated Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry were more likely to

96

report Jewish ancestry (Table 3 and Figure 1); fewer than half of individuals with less than 20%

97

Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry (roughly equivalent to one grandparent or great-grandparent

98

who was Ashkenazi Jewish) reported Jewish ancestry. Furthermore, most (62%, 258 of 415) of

99

the BRCA carriers who reported no Jewish ancestry did have at least 1% Ashkenazi Jewish

100

genetic ancestry. However, a lack of knowledge of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry could not fully

101

account for the 21% of carriers who did not report Jewish ancestry, as 8.4% (166 of 1,967) of

102

individuals carrying an Ashkenazi Jewish founder variant had no detectable Ashkenazi Jewish

103

genetic ancestry. This is consistent with the finding that at least two of these variants are also

104

found in people of other ethnicities [14]. Nine individuals reported Jewish ancestry but had no

105

detectable Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry.

The primary criterion for BRCA genetic testing is a personal or family history of breast, ovarian,

115

or certain other cancers (including prostate and pancreatic cancer). We therefore assessed

116

whether the carriers in our cohort had any family history of cancer. 393 carriers provided family

117

history information.

118
119

Among participants who reported Jewish ancestry, 41% reported no first-degree family history

120

of a BRCA-related cancer (Table 4). Similarly, 54% of participants who did not report Jewish

121

ancestry reported no first-degree family history of cancer. Although our family history data

122

differs substantially from guidelines used to determine genetic testing eligibility (which often

123

include age of diagnosis and more than one cancer of certain types), this number is consistent

124

with previous reports that about 50% of BRCA carriers would not be eligible for genetic testing

125

based on family history alone [5-8].

DISCUSSION

133

In this study, we describe a largely unselected cohort of ~2,800 individuals who carry one or

134

more of the three Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/2 founder variants. In characterizing the ancestry

135

and family cancer histories of these individuals, we made two key observations.

136
137

First, we found that a sizeable proportion (21%) of the carriers in our cohort do not self-report

138

Jewish ancestry. Of these individuals, more than half (62%) do have detectable Ashkenazi

139

Jewish genetic ancestry, although frequently in very low percentages (Table 3 and Figure 1).

140

Interestingly, 8% of all carriers have no detectable Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry,

141

consistent with reports that BRCA1 185delAG and 5382insC are found in women of other

142

ethnicities who are referred for clinical genetic testing [14].

143
144

Second, we observed that nearly half of individuals carrying an Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA variant

145

have no first-degree family history of a BRCA-related cancer and, in the absence of a personal

146

cancer history, would therefore be unlikely to qualify for clinical genetic testing. This percentage

147

is consistent with published reports that about 50% of BRCA carriers lack a strong family history

148

of cancer [5-8].

149
150

Limitations of this study include a potential ascertainment bias related to family cancer history,

151

as individuals with such histories may be more likely to answer questions about family cancer

152

history. In addition, due to the limited depth of our family history survey, we defined family

153

history as having a first-degree relative with breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer;

154

clinical testing criteria are typically stricter, requiring an early age of diagnosis and/or more than

155

one affected family member. Together, these two points suggest that our estimate of the fraction

156

of individuals who would be ineligible for testing based on family history alone under existing

157

screening guidelines is likely lower than the true fraction. Finally, because not all individuals in

158

this study provided ancestry and family history information, the number of individuals included in

159

some analyses is fairly small.

160
161

Our data suggest that a sizeable fraction of individuals with detectable Ashkenazi Jewish

162

genetic ancestry are unaware of that ancestry. This phenomenon is likely not unique to

163

Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. In addition to BRCA-related cancers, many other conditions are

164

more common in specific ancestral groups, including Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and

165

Gaucher disease type 1 in Ashkenazi Jews; sickle cell anemia in individuals with African

166

ancestry; and beta-thalassemia in individuals with Mediterranean and certain other ancestries.

167

For individuals who are unaware of their genetic ancestry, perceived risk for diseases could thus

168

differ substantially from actual risk, which could lead to missed opportunities for genetic

169

screening, prevention, and early intervention.

170
171

In recent years, several groups have called for broader access to BRCA genetic testing among

172

Ashkenazi Jews and among women in the general population [5-7,10,11]. Among Ashkenazi

173

Jews, where testing for the three founder variants can identify most BRCA carriers, population-

174

wide screening is cost-effective or even cost-saving [15]; in other ethnicities, more

175

comprehensive genetic testing would be required to identify most individuals carrying a BRCA

176

variant, but depending on the source of testing, this may also be cost-effective [16]. Our data

177

provide support for this growing call for expanded BRCA testing. Such testing would enable

178

women and men with a BRCA variant to learn their status, take steps to reduce their cancer

179

risk, and encourage cascade testing of close family members.
