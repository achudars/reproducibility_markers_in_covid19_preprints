Objective: To understand better the public perception and comprehension with medical

technology such as artificial intelligence and robotic surgery. Additionally, to identify sensitivity
to, and comfort with, the use of AI and robotics in medicine a in order to ensure acceptability
and quality of counseling and to guide future development.

Subjects and Methods: A survey was conducted on a convenience sample of visitors to the

Minnesota State Fair (n = 264). The survey investigated participant beliefs on the capabilities of
AI and robotics in medicine and their comfort with such technology. Participants were
randomized to receive one of two similar surveys. In the first a diagnosis was made by a
physician and in the second by an AI application in order to compare confidence in human and
computer-based diagnosis.

Results: The median age of participants was 45 (IQR 28-59), 58% were female (n=154) vs. 42%

male (n=110), 69% had completed at least a bachelor's degree, 88% were Caucasian (n=233) vs.
12% ethnic minorities (n=31) and were from 12 states in the US with most from the Upper
Midwest. Participants had nearly equal trust in AI vs. physician diagnoses, however, they were
significantly more likely to trust an AI diagnosis of cancer over a doctor's diagnosis when
responding to the version of the survey that suggested an AI could make medical diagnosis (p =
9.32e-06). Though 55% of respondents (n=145) reported they were uncomfortable with
automated robotic surgery the majority of the individuals surveyed (88%) mistakenly believed
that partially autonomous surgery was already being performed. Almost all (94%) stated they
would be willing to pay for an AI to review their medical imaging, if available.

Conclusion: Most participants express confidence in AI providing medical diagnoses, sometimes
even over human physicians. Participants generally expressed concern with surgical AI, but
mistakenly believe it is already happening. As AI applications make their way into medical
practice, health care providers should be cognizant of patient misconceptions and the
sensitivity that patients have to how such technology is represented.

Introduction

Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have introduced a new wave of
technologies to enhance the care of patients. Applications such as automatic measurement of
spatial features from medical imaging [1], precision medicine [2] and predictive methods
describing the potential course of a disease [3] are being actively developed. With such a wide
variety of new applications there has been much activity in development of data sets and
methods however relatively little research has been done on the public’s perception of artificial
intelligence in the care they receive. As a comparison, research into autonomous vehicles has
been similarly rapid and much has been written about the public perception of autonomous
vehicles and the potential implementation [4][5]. Small scale initial research has been done on
the intersection of medicine and AI from a consumer perspective [6]. This research found a
negative association with AI and medical care in the minds of consumers. This seems to indicate
a tension between the widespread research interest and the public interest in AI.
The technological advancement of AI has paralleled the development and introduction of
robotic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery in urology has been on the forefront of new surgical
technology with the use of robotics in procedures such as nephrectomy, prostatectomy and
cystectomy [7]. Previous studies which examine patients’ comfort and perception of such
surgery[8] [9] provide useful precedent when examining patients’ view of AI. A common thread
in this research has shown that there is misunderstanding about capabilities and extend of
current use, but there is a general optimism and prestige associated with new technologies.
Boys et al. found that almost 20% of the respondents believed the robot itself had some degree
of autonomy, offering a natural topic in which to investigate individuals' perceptions of AI in
medicine. The aim of this work is to explore public perceptions of AI in medicine, and evaluate
relationships between demographic characteristics and disposition toward AI and robotics in
the treatment and diagnosis of cancer.
Subjects and Methods

A questionnaire was developed to investigate attitudes and acceptance of new technologies in
medicine such as AI and robotic surgery. The survey was administered to a convenience sample
of attendees at the Minnesota State Fair on two days in 2019. Inclusion criteria were individuals
18 years or older who volunteered for and completed our questionnaire. Those who
participated were given a nominal prize valued at less than $5. The survey was selfadministered digitally on tablets.
Demographic information was collected including information on gender, age, level of highest
education, race, ethnicity, occupation and zip code. Additional demographic information
relevant to the zip code as recorded in the 2017 American Community Survey [10] was
incorporated. These variables include the median household income, a designation of whether

the zip code falls in a majority rural county, and the proportion of households that report
having a broadband internet connection.
Participants were asked a series of questions relating to the use of robotic surgery and artificial
intelligence (AI) applications in the treatment of cancer. The questions fall into four topics:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Active Surveillance
Autonomous Surgery
Conflicting Diagnosis Between a Doctor and AI
Consumer Facing Image Reading by AI

Each participant randomly received one of two versions of the survey. The only difference
between the two versions was the first question, which (paraphrasing) was either (1) “a
radiologist believes there’s a 25% chance your renal mass is cancer” or (2) “an AI believes
there’s a 25% chance your renal mass is cancer”. In both cases, the participant was told that the
recommended course is Active Surveillance. They were then asked whether they would pursue
a second opinion. If a participant responds with “yes” they were given a follow-up question
asking at what estimated confidence in benignity would they feel comfortable with active
surveillance. Options included: ’76-80%’, ’81-85%’, ’86-90%’, ’91-95%’, ’96-99%’ and ’>99%’.
A second set of questions investigated the participants’ perceptions of robotic surgery. First,
they were asked to estimate what proportion of a standard operation involving the surgical
robot is performed autonomously, and then they were asked to rate their comfort with robotic
surgery on a Likert Scale.
The next question asked the participant to select the diagnosis in which they have the highest
confidence between an AI and a doctor when the doctor believes a mass is cancerous while an
AI predicts that it is benign. The last question asked if the participant would be comfortable
with using a web service that evaluated their medical imaging in real time using an AI algorithm
in order to get a second opinion whether a mass was cancerous or not. If they indicated that
they would be comfortable with such a service, they were then asked what they would be
comfortable paying for such a service. Options were ‘$0’, ’$1-10’, ’$11-20’, ’$21-50’, ’$51-100’
and ’>$100’.
Responses were captured and stored in a REDCap (REDCap; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN,
USA) database through the University of Minnesota and then exported for analysis in R version
3.4.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Multivariate regressions and
multivariate logistic regressions were used as appropriate to identify associations between
demographic factors and responses. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant.
This survey was administered with the approval and oversight of the Institutional Review Board
of the University of Minnesota and informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Responses were collected from 298 participants over two days of data collection. After
removing incomplete responses, there were a total of 264 participants included in our study.
Demographics of the participants are outlined in Table 1 for both survey versions 1 and 2.
Survey response counts by question are found in Table 2.

Active Surveillance
Of the 264 responses, 163 individuals (62%) indicated that they would seek a second opinion
given the recommendation to wait on a surgery and watch the growth of the mass via imaging
and the rest indicated that they would follow the recommendation. Of those that received the
version of the question indicating that the recommendation was based on the evaluation of an
AI algorithm 67% indicated that they would seek a second opinion compared to 43 % when the
recommendation was based on a physician recommendation, however this was not found to be
significant in a chi-square test (p = 0.098). In multivariate analysis no demographic features
were found to be significant in predicting whether the participant would seek a second opinion.
Of those who indicated that they would seek a second opinion, a plurality of 42 out of 101
(42%), indicated that they would prefer a confidence level between 96-99%. See Table 2 for a
complete summary of responses. Lower levels of education were correlated with lower levels of
confidence required: (in order increasing absolute value of coefficients) those with some
college education (p = 0.032), those with an associate's degree (p = 0.024) and those with a high
school or GED (p = 0.0074) (see Table 3).

Autonomous Surgery
Despite the fact that there are no FDA approved autonomous robotic surgical systems in the
United States, when asked to estimate the percentage of a standard robotic surgery that was
autonomous, participants selected values ranging from 0% to 100%. The median value selected
was 31.5% and the mean 38.4%. No demographics were found to be significant in multiple
regression against this estimation.
With regard to comfort with robotic surgery, 47 participants (18%) indicated that they were
‘completely uncomfortable’ with robotic surgery, 98 (37%) ’somewhat uncomfortable’, 25 (9%)
’neither comfortable or uncomfortable’, 68 (26%) ’somewhat comfortable’ and 26 (10%)
’completely comfortable’. Results of multiple regression can be found in Table 4. Older
respondents and those whose zip codes had a higher percentage of households with a
broadband internet subscription were significantly more likely to choose ’completely
uncomfortable’ vs other responses. The odds ratio of age was 1.03 (p = 0.0061) and percentage
of households with broadband internet had odds ratio 1.13 (p = 0.032). Those who indicated zip
codes with higher median incomes were much less likely to select ’completely uncomfortable’,
with odds ratio 0.57 (p = 0.00078). Higher median incomes were more likely to select
’Somewhat comfortable’ vs other options (OR = 1.03, p = 0.014). Being male (OR = 5.02, p =
0.0010) and having an associate's degree (OR = 4.36, p = 0.037) were significant among those
selecting ’Completely comfortable’ vs all other options.

Taken together as a continuous measure of comfort (ranging from 1-5) being male (p = 0.0017),
having an associate’s degree (p = 0.041) and indicating a zip code with a higher median income
(p = 0.0012) all again had a positive relationship with comfort with robotic surgery. Selecting a
race other than white (p= 0.014) and neighborhoods with higher number of households with a
broadband internet subscription (p= 0.035) were both negatively related to comfort with
robotic surgery.

AI vs Physician
Given the scenario that a physician and an AI algorithm disagree in their estimation that a mass
is benign (the doctor believing it to be cancerous and the AI believing it to be benign) roughly
half of respondents, 144 out of 264, indicate a higher confidence in the AI. Those who randomly
received the second version of the survey, where an earlier question suggested AI can provide
recommendations, were much more likely to trust the AI’s diagnosis over the doctor (OR = 3.45,
p = <0.001). The majority of participants who received the first survey had greater confidence in
the doctor’s diagnosis while the reverse was true for those who received the second, as
highlighted in Figure 1. No other predictors were found to be significant. Complete multiple
regression results can be found in Table 5.

Second Opinion AI
Almost all participants (94%) indicated that they would be comfortable with sending their
medical imaging to an AI algorithm for review via a website. Of those individuals, 92% indicated
that they would be willing to pay for such a service.From lowest to highest: 11 (4%) selected
’$1-10’, 21 (8%) selected ’$11-20’, 46 (18%) selected ’$21-50’, 82 (33%) selected ’$51-100’ and
69 (28%) indicated they would be willing to pay more than $100. No significant relationships
were found between demographic variables and individuals’ responses in this category.

Discussion

The results of this survey show a great diversity in opinions on AI and robotic surgery in the
diagnosis and treatment of cancer. We did not find evidence to support a relationship with
many demographic features such as age, gender, rural vs. urban for most questions. Lower
levels of education were correlated with lower certainty required in the benign nature of a
mass in order to be comfortable with waiting on surgery. A number of factors were significantly
associated with comfort with robotic surgery, including lower age, Caucasian race, lack of
broadband internet connections, higher median income areas, having only an associate's
degree, and male gender. The most notable relationship found in this survey was the positive
association between receiving the version of the survey that posited an AI estimate in the first
question and having higher confidence in the diagnosis of an AI when it disagreed with the

physician. These results suggest an optimism toward medical applications of AI, but poor
understanding of its current capabilities and use.
In spite of the extensive adoption of robotic surgery in the US, there is still significant
misunderstanding about its nature. Even though surgical robots do not currently operate
autonomously in standard practice, 88% of participants believe that it does, at least to some
degree. While our sample is a convenience sample, individuals of every race age and education
overestimated the presence of autonomous behavior.
Also, in contrast with initial customer surveys [6] we found evidence to suggest a certain
openness to artificial intelligence applications. This finding aligns with recent research
suggesting that public perception and optimism of AI as a whole has risen markedly [11]. A third
of all participants believed that robotic surgery contained some autonomous behavior and
indicated that they were either ’Somewhat comfortable’ or ’Completely comfortable’ with such
a procedure.
Almost a third of individuals who received a recommendation to wait and monitor a tumor’s
growth based on an AI estimation were comfortable with following the recommendation. Many
patients could feel that an AI gives them additional certainty in their diagnosis which has been
shown to be predictive of quality of life in individuals undergoing monitoring of small renal
tumors [12].
The significant priming effect of first question suggests a sensitivity in overall opinion to how an
AI diagnosis is presented. Those that receive an indication that an AI can make a diagnosis show
greater confidence in it. Given the widespread research into AI applications in medicine, there
has been significant media coverage. In May 2019, the New York Times published an article
headlined "A.I. Took a Test to Detect Lung Cancer. It Got an A" [13]. Recently Google AI
announced a partnership with the Mayo Clinic [14]. Such media coverage has the possibility of
increasing the public's confidence in and perhaps inflates the capabilities of such technology.
Given public optimism about AI and the significant confusion about current technological
capabilities, there is a great need for careful patient counseling. There is unquestionably a large
number of promising applications for artificial intelligence in medicine, but current
implementations of AI are scarce and media representations of AI are often far beyond what is
currently robust in practice, which likely contributes to the optimism that we observe. This
optimism might be beneficial for early adoption, but the associated misperceptions could
hinder informed decision making and eventually damage trust. It’s therefore important to
discuss with patients the role that technology is playing in their care, along with its limitations.
Conclusion

There is significant variance in population perception and understanding of AI and robotic
surgery. Proactive conversations with patients who might be undergoing robotic surgery may
be beneficial. Ongoing research at both commercial and academic institutions, technology

companies and medical institutions, inevitably spurs media attention on medical AI. Our results
suggest that individuals’ opinions and confidence in AI are sensitive to such representations,
and if patients overestimate the capabilities of AI in medicine, it could lead them to take bigger
risks and accept greater uncertainties than they might be otherwise comfortable with. In
addition, an initial overestimation of AI capabilities may lead to early disappointment causing
techniques with real potential to be abandoned due to unmet expectations. As research
continues in AI applications, there is a need for clear communication going forward about the
strengths and limitations of such techniques.

Appendix B: Survey Text
Questions and responses for Survey 1 are as follows.

Questions on Active Surveillance
“Suppose you begin to experience stomach pain and decide to visit a medical
clinic. Your doctor orders an abdominal CT scan which shows a 3 cm (1.5 inch)
mass that could be a kidney cancer (see image below). She then refers you to a
urologist for a consult for surgical removal of the mass, which would have a 99%
chance of cure if it is cancer. The urologist explains that masses with CT
characteristics like yours are unlikely to be cancerous, estimating the chance this
mass is a kidney cancer is only 25%. He suggests that you undergo follow-up
imaging every six months moving forward, and that if the mass changes
considerably he will surgically remove it. Would you seek a second opinion?”

“Yes, I would seek another opinion”,

“No, I would follow the recommendation to watch the mass”

All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

“If you feel uncomfortable not treating a mass with a 25% chance of cancer, what
level of certainty do you need to have before your feel comfortable not treating a
mass?”

“76-80%”, “81-85%”, “86-90%”, “91-95%”, “96-99%”, “>99”

Autonomous Surgery
“Today, many surgical procedures are done with the assistance of a robot. In the
average robotic assisted surgery, what proportion of the procedure do you
estimate that the robot is operating autonomously (or in other words, by itself
without guidance from the surgeon)? ”

(User input slider 0-100)

“If a robot were developed to perform a cancer surgery completely autonomously
(in other words, the robot performs the surgery by itself without guidance from a
surgeon). What would your comfort level be to undergo that type of operation?”

“Completely uncomfortable”, “Somewhat uncomfortable”, “Neither comfortable
or uncomfortable”, “Somewhat comfortable”, “Completely comfortable”

AI vs Physician
“Suppose you visit your clinic for nausea and your doctor orders a CT scan of the
abdomen. Your doctor then reviews your imaging and doesn’t find an explanation
for your nausea, but unexpectedly finds an adrenal mass which she believes is
cancer. However, an artificial intelligence computer algorithm also reviews your
imaging and concludes your adrenal mass is benign. In which diagnosis do you
have a higher confidence? ”

“The doctor”, “The artificial intelligence/computer algorithm”

Second Opinion AI
“If there was a website where an artificial intelligence/computer algorithm was
able to read your CT scan to give you a second opinion on whether a mass is
cancer or not, would you allow your CT scan to be read by a computer?”

“Yes”, “No”

“If you would allow a computer to read your CT scan how much would you be
willing to pay for that service?”
“$0”, “$1-10”, “$11-20”, “$21-50”, “$51-100”, “>$100”
