Abstract
Treatment response assessment for patients with advanced solid tumors is complex and existing
methods require greater precision. Current guidelines rely on imaging, which has known
limitations, including the time required to show a deterministic change in target lesions. Serial
changes in whole-genome (WG) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were used to assess response
or resistance to treatment early in the treatment course. 96 patients with advanced cancer were
prospectively enrolled (91 analyzed and 5 excluded), and blood was collected before and after
initiation of a new, systemic treatment. Plasma cell-free DNA libraries were prepared for either
WG or WG bisulfite sequencing. Longitudinal changes in the fraction of ctDNA were quantified
to retrospectively identify molecular progression (MP) or major molecular response (MMR).
Study endpoints were concordance with first follow-up imaging (FFUI) and stratification of
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with MP (n=13) had shorter
PFS (median 62d vs. 310d) and OS (255d vs. not reached). Sensitivity for MP to identify clinical
progression was 54% and specificity was 100%. MP calls were from samples taken a median of
28d into treatment and 39d before FFUI. Patients with MMR (n=27) had longer PFS and OS
compared to those with neither call (n=51). Molecular response assessment can potentially
enable early switching to potentially effective therapies, therefore minimizing side effects and
costs associated with additional cycles of ineffective treatment. MMR may present a novel
endpoint to target to improve long-term patient outcomes.

Introduction
The current standard of care for clinical evaluation of treatment response for advanced solid
tumors is based on physical exams, patient reported symptoms, and periodic radiographic tumor
assessments that are compared with baseline scans to determine whether the patient is
responding or progressing while on active treatment. However, there are limitations to these
approaches as subtle changes in disease are often asymptomatic, and considerable costs,
uncertainty, and anxiety can be associated with frequent imaging. In clinical trials, imaging
response criteria are standardized to guide evaluation by comparing a baseline scan before
treatment initiation with periodic follow-up imaging with pre-specified criteria for response
(Eisenhauer et al. 2009; Seymour et al. 2017). These criteria can be limited by the reliability of
measurements over time, difficult to measure sites of disease (e.g., bone or pleural effusions),
and challenges distinguishing pseudoprogression from true progression (Erasmus et al. 2003;
Nishino et al. 2017; Chiou and Burotto 2015). In addition, inter-operator variability in comparing
serial scans remains a limitation in response assessment (Kuhl et al. 2019). Therefore, novel
methods for monitoring response to treatment are needed given the emergence of new treatment
modalities with ongoing questions regarding how best to manage treatment, minimize toxicity,
and control costs.
Liquid biopsy assays in cancer patients may analyze circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA),
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), RNA, exosomes, or proteins (Wan et al. 2017; Siravegna et al.
2017). ctDNA likely originates from cancer cells undergoing apoptosis, necrosis, or potential
active mechanisms involving nucleic acid secretion to facilitate metastasis and gene expression
at distant sites (Heitzer et al. 2015). The amount of ctDNA correlates with more advanced stages

of disease and is also affected by tumor type, origin, location of metastasis, and treatment (Chen
et al. 2016; Merker et al. 2018). There are several distinguishing features between ctDNA and
non-tumor cfDNA. Specifically, as compared with cfDNA, ctDNA contains tumor-specific
somatic point mutations, structural variations, shorter fragment lengths, biased fragment start and
end positions, and changes in epigenetic patterns (Murtaza et al. 2013; Chan, Jiang, Zheng, et al.
2013; Mouliere et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2015; Underhill et al. 2016; Snyder et al. 2016; Jiang et
al. 2018; Sun et al. 2015).
Copy number aberrations (CNA), which consist of either deletions or duplications of portions of
the genome, are a common form of structural variation that are observed in patients with
advanced disease at various sites across the genome (Beroukhim et al. 2010). Prior studies have
demonstrated that CNAs can be detected in cfDNA from patients by low-pass next-generation
sequencing (NGS) with CNAs detected at a higher rate in patients with advanced
disease (Mouliere et al. 2018; Adalsteinsson et al. 2017). To date, changes in CNAs over time in
advanced cancer patients remain understudied.
Global hypomethylation is a hallmark of tumor genomes (Sun et al. 2015; Hon et al. 2012), and
an increase in global methylation levels in cfDNA might be associated with non-progression as it
would indicate a decreased proportion of ctDNA. Importantly, the epigenetic patterns observed
in tumors, including overall global hypomethylation can be detected in ctDNA and could
therefore have potential for tracking patients over time (Chan, Jiang, Chan, et al. 2013; Usadel et
al. 2002).
Recently, there has been significant interest in evaluating the potential clinical utility of ctDNA
in advanced solid tumors. In the adjuvant setting, residual ctDNA after surgery (e.g., minimal
residual disease) has been associated with disease recurrence across multiple tumor types (Pantel
and Alix-Panabières 2019; Abbosh et al. 2018; Chae and Oh 2019; Merker et al. 2018; Rossi and
Ignatiadis 2019). In advanced disease, the most well validated clinical use is to identify driver
mutations with known drug targets (Lanman et al. 2015; Diaz and Bardelli 2014; Reckamp et al.
2016; Juric et al. 2019). Additionally, resistance mutations have been identified in the blood with
the goal of guiding clinical management (Fribbens et al. 2016). While prior studies have
evaluated the potential role of tracking ctDNA for tumor response assessment in several solid
tumor types, typically tracking mutant allele frequencies or acquired resistance mutations, the
clinical utility for routine assessment has not yet been established (Diehl et al. 2008; Dawson et
al. 2013; Murtaza et al. 2013; Tie et al. 2015; Pécuchet et al. 2016; Hrebien et al. 2019; Merker
et al. 2018).
Here, in a prospectively enrolled, advanced stage, pan-cancer cohort, we performed WG cfDNA
analysis to use ctDNA as a molecular marker for response assessment earlier in the treatment
course compared with routine clinical and radiographic assessment of disease. In contrast to
analyzing particular genes, our approach utilized CNAs and fragmentation patterns across the
genome, a technique with broad potential clinical applications across multiple tumor types.
Furthermore, for a subset of patients, we performed bisulfite conversion as part of the assay,
which provided insight into genome-wide methylation changes. We hypothesized that early
changes in cancer-associated signals in the blood would be predictive of response status at the

time of FFUI and that the magnitude of the dynamic change in signal would provide longer-term
prognostic information across a variety of solid tumor types and treatments.

Patients and Methods
Study subjects
The study sample here represented a subset of a currently accruing longitudinal observational
study. From May 2017 to December 2018, participants (age >18 years) were prospectively
enrolled from five oncology centers in the USA (TMPN - Cancer Care, Redondo Beach, CA;
Scripps - California Cancer Associates, San Diego, CA; Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego,
CA; Summit Cancer Centers, Post Falls, ID; Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of
Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) and followed through September 2019 (Table 1). Though
five centers were enrolled in the study, only participants from four sites were included in this
analysis because one site only enrolled sarcoma patients, which were held for future studies.
Eighty percent of the participants in this analysis came from one center (Supp. Table S1).
Eligibility criteria were:
1. Diagnosis of a non-hematologic and surgically unresectable advanced tumor (stage III or

higher) at presentation
2. Commencement of a new systemic treatment regimen of the physician’s choice
3. Presence of either measurable or evaluable disease by imaging

To be included in this cohort, the participants needed to have venous blood samples from at least
two time points: a baseline (T0, before treatment initiation) and another one before cycle 2 (T1)
and/or cycle 3 (T2, Fig. 1A). This timing for our assay, in line with the standard clinical visits
was designed to assess whether it could be of use if integrated into current practice without
adding additional appointments. The timing in our study was in line with prior work optimizing
the collection timing of liquid biopsy samples for use as a surrogate for PFS (Hrebien et al.
2019). The study reported here was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and approved by Northwestern University, Sharp Memorial Hospital and Western Institutional
Review Boards. An informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to participation in the
study.

Evaluation of response status
Participants were radiologically assessed at baseline and again at first follow-up as determined
per standard of care routine clinical assessment. The primary endpoint of the study was evidence
of radiographic progression as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) or clinical response evaluation. Measurable
disease changes by imaging were interpreted by an independent radiologist, who was blinded to
the assessment of molecular response. Radiographic assessments were categorized as progressive
disease (PD) or non-progressive disease (nonPD) which included both partial response (PR) and
stable disease (SD). When RECIST outcome could not be ascertained due to either non4

evaluable or missing imaging scans, clinical response evaluation was used with PD defined
based on the physician’s outcome assessment before a treatment change.
OS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to death due to any cause. PFS was
defined as the time from the start of treatment to first documentation of PD, or death due to any
cause, whichever occurred first. Patients last known to be alive and progression-free were
censored at the date of last follow-up. Patients were considered as lost to follow-up if they were
no longer part of the study and their status after FFUI was unknown.

Sample preparation
At each time point, 10 mL of whole blood was collected in Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT. Plasma
was separated via centrifugation at 1600 x g for 15 minutes followed by 2500 x g for 10 minutes
within 7 days from the time of collection. cfDNA was extracted from plasma using the Qiagen
QIAmp MinElute ccfDNA kit and stored at -20C until library preparation. For each patient,
libraries were prepared using the KAPA HyperPrep library prep kit for whole genome
sequencing (WGS; n=53 patients) or the Nugen Ovation Ultralow Methyl-Seq whole genome
bisulfite sequencing kit (WGBS; n=38 patients). Average input cfDNA into the library
preparation was 20 ng. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X to an average depth of
20X (range 6-29X).

Bioinformatics methods
Reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh37) with a custom bioinformatics pipeline
based on BWA (Li and Durbin 2009), sambamba (Tarasov et al. 2015), and samtools (Li et al.
2009). WGBS libraries were processed with an adapted pipeline to align sequencing data to a
bisulfite-converted human genome (Krueger and Andrews 2011). Reads were then de-duplicated
and GC biases were corrected using the deepTools software package (Ramírez et al. 2014).
Sequencing quality was validated using Picard (Broad Institute 2019) to assess mapping
efficiency, GC bias, and duplication rate, as well as MethylDackel (Ryan 2017) for WGBS
libraries to measure bisulfite conversion efficiency.
Tumor fraction ratio (TFR) was measured to assess changes in ctDNA using CNAs and local
changes in cfDNA fragment length, both assessed from sequencing data. CNAs were detected
using a pipeline based on ichorCNA (Adalsteinsson et al. 2017) and custom algorithms.
Normalized fragment length was computed by normalizing by library and genomic location.
Background signals for CNA and fragment length were established for each sequencing protocol
using healthy normal samples taken from 44 individuals with no current or prior diagnosis of any
malignancy (Supp. Table S2). In order to maximize sensitivity of CNAs while preventing false
positive detections, Spearman’s rank correlation between local mean fragment length and copy
number was used as a disqualifier of CNA call sets (Hellwig et al. 2018; Mouliere et al. 2018).
To assess changes in ctDNA over time, direct comparison of the CNA-derived estimate of
absolute tumor fraction between a patient’s time points was not always reliable because there
was ambiguity in which read depth levels correspond to which structural events. For example,

two regions might be called as either a neutral region and a duplicated region, or a heterozygous
deletion and a neutral region, in a highly mutated tumor where there was an ambiguous neutral
level. To circumvent this, CNAs detected at multiple time points were compared longitudinally
with a linear model to quantify TFR. In order to determine confident calls, measured changes
were compared to a simulated background model and required to exceed a Z-score threshold of
3. No longitudinal comparisons of samples from 44 healthy participants (Supp. Table S1)
showed a significant change in TFR (e.g. Supp. Fig. S1). Cases that showed a confident increase
in tumor fraction indicated by TFR greater than 1 at either time point were retrospectively
classified as molecular progression (MP). A confident increase was defined to be a TFR between
a follow up time point and the baseline of 1 plus a confidence interval equivalent to three
standard deviations based on the variation in depth in the copy number altered regions in an
unaffected participant library. Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as a TFR < 0.1, an
arbitrary cutoff (1 log reduction) selected prior to PFS and OS assessment.

Statistical Analysis
For the purposes of calculating sensitivity and specificity, true positives were defined as cases
where the assay showed a molecular progression which were also evaluated as PD either
clinically or radiographically at FFUI; true negatives were cases with no MP and clinical or
radiographic nonPD at FFUI. False positives and false negatives were cases where molecular
response assessment disagreed with the clinical or radiographic assessment at FFUI of PD or
nonPD, respectively. Confidence intervals on these metrics were computed with the Wilson’s
score interval method.
Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method for PFS and OS. The Cox
proportional hazards model was used to analyze the association of assay results and clinical
covariates to PFS and OS. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated with a score test
on Schoenfeld residuals (Grambsch and Therneau 1994). Differences in survival were assessed
with the Wald test. For two groups in the subset analysis, the Cox regression did not converge
due to the small number of events in these subgroups (Immunotherapy PFS and
Endocrine/Targeted therapy OS), so a ridge penalty was applied to assay results (Verweij and
Van Houwelingen 1994). For multivariable analysis, line of therapy was grouped into treatment
naive (1st line of therapy) and previously treated (2nd or greater line). All P values were twosided. Statistical analyses of survival were performed with the R survival package version 2.41-3
and other statistical analyses were determined using the python scipy package version 1.1.0.

Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 96 patients with advanced cancer, who met the inclusion criteria of the study and had
at least FFUI, were sequenced for the analysis (Supp. Fig. S2). Baseline blood samples failed
sequencing for five participants and were therefore excluded. The remaining 91 patients with
NGS and clinical outcome data were included in this analysis. The median age was 70 years and

55% were females (Table 1). About half of the participants received a first-line therapy (53%)
and 25% received a second-line therapy. The majority of patients had lung cancer (44%) or breast
cancer (26%), with the remainder of the cohort representing gastrointestinal cancers (GI, 15%,
specific types in Supp. Table S3), genitourinary cancers (GU, 7%), melanoma (7%) and sarcoma
(1%). During the study, 46% of all participants received chemotherapy (+/- antibody treatment,
i.e. trastuzumab, pertuzumab, panitumumab, ramucirumab, bevacizumab, olaratumab) and 37%
received immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy or a histone deacetylase inhibitor (Table
1, Supp. Table S4). FFUI occurred a median of 69 days after treatment start (Fig. 1B, min=26
days, max=208 days). Three participants received an outcome assignment based on clinical
evaluation. Of these three participants, one had a non-evaluable imaging study and was assessed
as clinical nonPD at week-12, and two did not have an imaging study prior to treatment change,
and these patients were assessed as clinical PD at week-9 and week-19 by the treating physician.
The median follow-up time of the full cohort was 384 days (min=60 days, max=754 days).
Baseline blood samples were collected prior to treatment start for all patients (Fig. 1B, median=0
days after treatment start, earliest 19 days before treatment start). One or two post-treatment
samples were collected for each patient, with T1 collected prior to the second cycle of therapy at
a median of 21 days after treatment start (n=85, min=14 days, max=40 days) and T2 collected
prior to the third cycle of therapy at a median of 42 days (n=66, min=37 days, max=84 days).
Most blood samples were from before FFUI; however, there were some exceptions with three T1
samples taken the same day or later (median 44 days before FFUI) and 12 T2 samples taken the
same day as or later (median 26 days before FFUI). Both post-treatment samples were collected
for 60 patients.

Serial measurements of ctDNA show rapid changes early on
treatment
We assessed changes in tumor fraction using WG analysis to quantify the TFR between baseline
and post-treatment samples. Substantial changes in TFR were observed early after treatment
initiation (Fig. 2). Patient LS030178 is included as an example of a rapid increase in TFR to 2.4
at T1 following the first cycle of therapy, indicating a major increase from baseline, followed by
an even greater increase at T2 (Fig. 2A-D). This patient had a somatic gain of the long arm of
chromosome 1 (1q), which has been shown to be one of the most common arm-level aberrations
in breast cancer (Berger et al. 2018). Additionally, the strong pattern of CNAs was corroborated
by the fragmentation pattern (Fig. 2B-C). Conversely, patient LS030093 showed a decrease in
TFR at T1 and then a larger decrease at T2, indicating response to treatment (Fig. 2E).
A subset of samples had both WGS and WGBS and were used to test whether TFR could be
quantified equivalently across sequencing protocols (Supp. Fig. S3). TFR values were highly
concordant between WGS and WGBS, enabling analysis of the full cohort including samples
analyzed with both protocols.

Changes in tumor fraction at early time points predict
radiographic progression
At FFUI, 24 of 91 patients had PD and 67 had nonPD. To evaluate the predictive value of the
ctDNA assay, we compared the classification of MP to FFUI for all patients (Fig. 3A). All 13
patients with an MP at either T1 or T2 had PD, and of the 66 patients who were nonPD, none had
MP. The sensitivity of the assay including time points T1 and T2 was 54% and specificity was
100%. The sensitivity was 41% at T1 and was 65% at T2 (Fig. 3B). While the sensitivity at
individual time points increased between T1 and T2, there was no statistically significant
relationship between sensitivity and timing of the blood draw (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
P=0.077, Supp. Fig. S4). In cases where MP was called, the time point where it was first
identified preceded the detection of progression by imaging as scheduled by standard practice by
a median of 39 days (Fig. 3C).
Among the 11 patients with PD at FFUI for whom MP was not called on either time point, three
had no confident CNAs detected, two had no significant change in tumor fraction, and six had a
decrease in tumor fraction. For the discordant cases with a decrease in tumor fraction, there were
a variety of cancer types represented (three breast, one lung, one renal, one sarcoma), treatments
(three chemotherapy, one immunotherapy, one endocrine therapy, one targeted therapy alone),
and lines of therapy (two first, two second, one third, one fifth). Additionally, there were no
major differences in predictive performance between WGS and WGBS (Supp. Table S5).

Molecular response assessment correlates with PFS and OS
We examined PFS and OS to evaluate the predictive value of early molecular response
assessment. The full cohort of patients (n=91) had median PFS of 255 days and median OS of
600 days (Supp. Fig. S5). Patients with MP at either T1 or T2 (n=13) had significantly shorter
PFS (HR=11.5 [95% CI 5.4-24.9], P=4.2×10 ), with a median PFS of 62 days vs. 310 days for
patients with no MP (n=78; Fig. 3D). These patients also had significantly shorter OS (HR=5.0
[95% CI 2.3-10.6], P=3.6×10 ), with 255 days median OS for patients with MP (n=13) and OS
median not reached for those with no MP (n=78; Fig. 3E).

Clinical covariates may also contribute to survival in our heterogeneous cohort. In univariate
analysis (Supp. Table S6) prior treatment was the only clinical variable associated with PFS
(P=0.0038), and none of the clinical covariates were significantly associated with OS. In
multivariable analysis, we found that after controlling for line of therapy (Supp. Table S7), MP
remained strongly associated with both PFS and OS.
We explored the predictive performance in subgroups based on tumor origin (Fig. 3F, Supp. Fig.
S6) and treatment type (Fig. 3G, Supp. Fig. S7). Cancer type subgroups included lung cancer
(n=40), breast cancer (n=24), and the remainder of mixed tumor types (n=27) including GI, GU,
melanoma, and sarcoma. We found that MP was significantly associated with both PFS and OS
in both lung cancer and breast cancer subsets, and with PFS but not OS in the remaining cases.
Subgroups based on the type of systemic therapy received included immunotherapy (with or
without chemotherapy or histone deacetylase inhibitor, n=34), chemotherapy (with or without

targeted or endocrine therapy, n=42) and other patients (n=15), who were on targeted and/or
endocrine therapy alone. While MP was significantly associated with OS for the immunotherapy
and chemotherapy subgroups, the association did not reach significance for the smaller subgroup
of endocrine and/or targeted therapy. However, MP was significantly associated with PFS for all
treatment type subgroups. Additionally, we found that MP was significantly associated with both
PFS and OS for subsets of patients who were treatment naive or had prior lines of treatment
(Supp. Fig. S8). Predictions of radiographic progression also had comparable performance across
these subsets (Supp. Table S8).

Major molecular response early on treatment predicts long-term
outcome
We hypothesized that a large quantitative reduction early in the treatment course would be
associated with an improved outcome. Of the 78 patients with no MP, 27 had an MMR at either
post-treatment time point, defined as a 10-fold decrease in TFR. Notably, in all cases where an
MMR was identified at T1, this finding was also observed at T2, if that time point was available
(n=12). In seven cases the TFR from baseline did not reach a 10-fold reduction at T1 but did at
T2, for example for patient LS030093 (Fig. 2E).
We found that patients with an MMR (n=27) had longer PFS (Fig. 4A, median PFS of 749 days)
compared to patients with no MP and no MMR (n=51; median PFS of 211 days), a difference
that was significant (MMR: HR=0.45 [95% CI 0.22-0.92], P=0.028, Supp. Table S9). These
patients also had significantly longer OS (Fig. 4B; MMR: OS median not reached, HR=0.116
[95% CI 0.027-0.496], P=0.0036) compared to patients with no MP and no MMR (median OS of
546 days). A multivariable analysis controlling for line of therapy (Supp. Table S10) showed that
MMR remained strongly associated with OS. However, the association was marginal for PFS.
Next, we sought to assess the predictive value of an MMR in the context of radiographic
response monitoring. For patients with radiographic PR or SD at FFUI (n=66), the radiographic
assessment of PR or SD had limited prognostic value for PFS (Fig. 4C; HR=0.62 [95% CI 0.301.30]) or OS (Fig. 4D; HR 0.50 [95% CI 0.19-1.36]). Among the same subset, patients with an
MMR (n=25) had substantially longer PFS (HR=0.46 [95% CI 0.20-1.02]) and OS (HR=0.160
[95% CI 0.037-0.699]) than patients with no MP and no MMR (n=41; Fig. 4E-F, Supp. Fig. S9).
These results indicate that early quantitative ctDNA dynamics have value for predicting long
term treatment efficacy, beyond what is known from initial radiographic assessment.

Longitudinal changes in methylation levels may complement
tumor fraction changes
To assess the potential of methylation changes for identifying early response to therapy, the
change in genome-wide methylation levels from baseline to post-treatment was examined

was observed in LS030078 (Fig. 5B). For patient LS030078, a clear molecular progression was
observed based on CNAs and local fragmentation changes (TFR=2.01), while no CNAs were
detectable in LS030083.

Discussion
Patients with advanced malignancies require careful treatment monitoring to assess therapeutic
efficacy, promote quality of life, and limit drug toxicity. Current methods for disease monitoring
using clinical and radiographic assessment often require several months to confidently determine
treatment response. Learning this result with high predictive value at an earlier date would be a
major improvement in the management of advanced cancers by significantly accelerating the
feedback loop regarding therapy effectiveness.
Here, we assessed the utility of a novel, whole-genome cfDNA molecular response assay, which
analyzed longitudinal ctDNA measurements at baseline and during the initial cycles of treatment
to identify response to therapy. In addition to showing a strong association with survival as
observed in previous studies, this technique identified disease progression with a specificity of
100%, so there was high confidence and reliability for these calls. Moreover, MP calls were
performed at a median of 6 weeks before clinical or radiographic methods confirmed these
assessments. A number of prior studies have evaluated longitudinal ctDNA dynamics to assess
tumor response to systemic therapy. Several of these have found strong concordance with
survival endpoints (Diehl et al. 2008; Tie et al. 2015; Pécuchet et al. 2016; Murtaza et al. 2013).
Additionally, ctDNA biomarkers have been shown to be associated with outcome assessed by
standard of care imaging (Tie et al. 2015; Pécuchet et al. 2016; Jensen et al. 2019). Together,
these and our findings indicate that ctDNA changes in the blood reflect treatment response and
resistance early in the course of treatment, likely before changes in the shape, density, or size of
the target lesions on imaging.
Further, we demonstrated that patients with an MMR had a longer PFS and OS compared to
those with no change or a smaller decrease in TFR, indicating that there was quantitative value in
the degree of initial response to therapy. The additional prognostic value of identifying an MMR
supports the potential to integrate imaging and analysis of serial cfDNA samples to provide an
early indication of an extended duration of disease control.
We have also found that the blood-based, WG ctDNA molecular assay detected disease
progression consistently across a variety of tumors, in the context of any systemic therapy, by
looking beyond targeted assessment of tumor-specific point mutations and fusions. Specifically,
subset analyses of the two cohorts with the largest number of patients by cancer type (lung and
breast cancer) and by treatment modality (chemotherapy and immunotherapy) demonstrated a
strong association between MP and PFS and OS. For other subgroups of cancer site and
treatment type, MP was only associated with PFS but not OS. These groups were more
heterogeneous and had smaller sample sizes compared to breast and lung cancers and
chemotherapy and immunotherapy groups. Further studies based on more homogeneous cohorts
with appropriate sample sizes are needed to validate the utility of this assay in each of these
clinical settings.

Many prior studies have focused on point mutations, tracked by ultra high depth NGS or digital
PCR (dPCR). A challenge for these methods is that they must reliably select driver or truncal
mutations in each individual case, a process that may need to be calibrated for cancer and
treatment type. A common approach is based on tumor tissue sequencing to identify mutations
for tracking, but access to adequate tissue varies by tumor type and may be limiting in an
advanced disease setting. Biopsies at this stage are often difficult to perform and run the risk of
missing relevant clonal mutations, given the genetic heterogeneity of metastatic lesions. In
contrast, low-coverage WG approaches can be used to detect (Adalsteinsson et al. 2017;
Mouliere et al. 2018) and track changes (Jensen et al. 2019) at low cost based on blood samples
alone. A single assay with consistent performance across multiple cancer types and treatment
modalities, as we have observed in this study, could facilitate the broad application of a
molecular approach to treatment monitoring.
This study has several limitations. First, despite this being a prospectively enrolled study, there
were a number of protocol deviations reflecting a wide range of clinical practice patterns. About
30% of participants were not properly enrolled or followed. The study was purposefully designed
not to disrupt the flow of clinical care. We made every effort to include participants who met the
inclusion criteria and had blood collections from at least two timepoints to avoid introducing
bias.
Second, while the specificity of the assay was very high, which is the critical performance metric
for clinical utility in the advanced setting, sensitivity to identify clinical progression early in the
treatment course was relatively low. Sensitivity, particularly at the earliest time point, may be
improved by including other features such as cancer-associated epigenetic signals. For example,
in patient LS030083, there was a marked increase in genome-wide methylation levels from
baseline to post-treatment, consistent with a nonPD call at FFUI, but no CNAs were detected
(Figure 5A). In future work, we plan to incorporate these methylation-based signals into the
assay, along with fragment length and copy number information with the goal of increasing
assay sensitivity. However, even with additional orthogonal signals, there will still be a residual
false negative rate from a) tumors that do not generate sufficient ctDNA (i.e. non-shedding
tumors), b) tumors that have not yet progressed during the earliest cycles of treatment and, c)
tumors in which molecular progression by ctDNA analysis and imaging are not in agreement.
Third, the study was not powered to conduct subgroup analysis. However, since there was a
significant main effect, we explored the assay’s predictive ability across different cancer and
treatment types. We hypothesized that the dynamics of early changes in cancer-associated
signals in the blood identified by WGS are agnostic to cancer type as the results of this study
suggest. Prospective validation studies are planned to confirm the observed findings to give
clinicians the confidence to use this assay to manage treatment.
Molecular response monitoring with serial measurements of cfDNA has potential clinical
benefits for both assessing disease progression and disease control, if further validated in an
adequately powered prospective clinical validation study. An early call of MP would lead
oncologists to consider discontinuation of ineffective treatments, thereby reducing avoidable side
effects and financial toxicity. By accelerating the clinical feedback loop, patients would be

afforded the opportunity to change to an alternative, potentially effective therapy. In contrast,
MMR would provide confidence in the current treatment plan, and encourage clinicians and
patients to maintain the course. Clinicians could also potentially reduce the frequency of imaging
in these cases. In addition, new adaptive approaches should be considered with MMR as the
interim endpoint in clinical trials. Moreover, a blood-based assay provides convenience for
patients as blood samples are collected routinely during the course of therapy. Patients may have
improved outcomes by limiting side effects and costs associated with ineffective treatments,
trying alternate potentially effective treatments earlier, and feeling encouraged with early
exceptional response to maintain the course.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that identifying disease progression through earlier low-pass
WG ctDNA-based monitoring was concordant with standard of care clinical assessment and the
degree of ctDNA reduction was strongly correlated with long-term outcome. These findings
were consistent across multiple tumor and treatment types. The assay captured changes in tumor
biology that occurred early in the course of systemic therapy, which may be observed before
confident radiographic detection of these changes is possible. If validated prospectively, this
non-invasive tool would allow oncologists and patients to understand response and resistance to
treatment in a more precise and timely way.
