ABSTRACT

2

Background

3

Insecticide-treated Nets (ITNs) and house modifications are proven vector control tools, yet

4

full coverage has frequently not been achieved. This study investigates factors associated

5

with ITN access and use of house modification in Tanzania.

6

Methods

7

Baseline data from cross-sectional surveys was analysed from 7,240 households in

8

Bagamoyo (60km north of Dar es Salaam) and 1,241 households in Ulanga (a remote rural

9

area), from previous studies on spatial repellants and indoor residual spray evaluation. We

10

estimated the associations between the outcomes: population access to ITNs, ITN per

11

sleeping spaces, presence of window screens and closed eaves, and the covariates household

12

size, age, gender, pregnancy, education, mosquito entry (doors and windows), house

13

modification (window screens & closed eaves), mean distance to mosquito breeding sites and

14

wealth using regression models.

15

Results

16

Population access to ITNs (households with one ITN per two potential people that stayed in

17

the house the previous night of the survey) was 64% (56 - 71) and ITNs per sleeping spaces

18

(households with enough ITNs to cover all sleeping spaces used the previous night of the

19

survey) was 63% (54 - 72) in Bagamoyo, three years after the last Universal Coverage

20

Campaigns (UCC). These findings are both lower than the 80% coverage target of the

21

Tanzania National Malaria Strategic Plan (Tanzania NMSP). In Ulanga, population access to

22

ITNs was 84% (78 - 91) and ITNs per sleeping spaces was 93% (89 - 97), one year after the

23

last UCC. Household size was significantly associated with lower access to ITNs even shortly

24

after UCC. House modification was common in both areas. In Bagamoyo, screened windows

1

were more common than closed eaves (61% vs 14%) whereas in Ulanga more houses had

2

closed eaves than window screens (55% vs 12%). Households in the poorest quintile were

3

less likely to adopt window screening and closing eaves in Bagamoyo, this contrasts with

4

Ulanga district where a greater proportion of poorer households blocked eaves with mud but

5

were less likely to adopt screening.

6

Conclusion

7

Population access to ITN was substantially lower than the targets of the Tanzania NMSP after

8

three years and lower among larger households after one year following ITN campaign.

9

House modification was common in both areas, motivated by wealth. Improved access to

10

ITNs and window screens through subsidy, especially among larger households, uptake of a

11

combination of these two interventions may be maximized.

BACKGROUND

15

Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs) have made the greatest contribution to the reduction in

16

malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa [1], through both individual and especially community

17

effects that reduce the proportion of mosquitoes living long enough to transmit malaria [2].

18

ITNs work best when applied at high (>80%) coverage [2]. Hence, ITNs are recommended

19

by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be universally and continuously distributed to

20

all people at risk of malaria [3]. Multiple ITN delivery strategies and campaigns have been

21

implemented across sub-Saharan Africa, either targeting specific malaria risk populations

22

(children under 5 years of age and pregnant women), or targeting the entire population using

23

health facilities, antenatal clinics (ANC), schools, markets, door-to-door and other methods

24

[4]–[7]. Despite more than a decade of ITN campaigns, 60% of the population in malaria

1

endemic areas, including Tanzania still do not have access to an ITN [8], which means that

2

far greater malaria control could be attained with improvement in access of this highly

3

efficacious intervention.

4

House modification using window screens or blocking eaves (Figure 1) which serve as

5

barriers against mosquito entry has been shown to be associated with lower malaria infection

6

[9] and a control tool for other vector borne diseases [10]. However, house modification is

7

not currently delivered operationally as a vector control tool, being generally considered too

8

costly or difficult to implement [11]. Perhaps, because of high installation cost [12], there is

9

limited support from government or other organisations [13] to promote house modification

10

as a public health tool even though it provides protection from mosquito vectors when people

11

are indoors but outside of sleeping hours (i.e. when people are not protected by ITNs) [14],

12

and thereby can prevent malaria and other vector-borne diseases such as dengue. There is

13

evidence of houses with window screens and closed eaves among the urban Tanzanian

14

population due to their effectiveness in improving house ventilation and preventing mosquito

15

entry and nuisance [15], [16].

16

This paper reports the drivers of access to ITNs and the use of house modification between

17

two rural populations: one far from and one close to an urban centre, as it is known that

18

access to economic centers affects the economic, education, and health status of populations

19

[17]. As the NMCP in Tanzania is now stratifying vector control delivery systems (Tanzania

20

ITN Plan 2016-2020, unpublished) in line with WHO policy [18]. This work is aimed to

21

provide useful information to policy makers in maximising access to and use of these existing

22

malaria control tools.

Study area and demographic characteristics

2

The study was conducted in Bagamoyo and Ulanga districts (Figure 2). Bagamoyo district is

3

located on the east coast of Tanzania, approximately 60 km north of Dar es Salaam, the

4

economic hub of the country [19] and Ulanga district is located in rural south east Tanzania,

5

300km from the regional city of Morogoro and 500km from Dar es Salaam [20]. In

6

Bagamoyo and Ulanga, the average household size was 4.4 and 4.9 persons per household,

7

respectively in the 2012 Tanzania National Census [21]. Adult literacy in Bagamoyo was

8

58% and 66% in Ulanga [22]. The average rainfall and temperature are 1200 to 2100 mm per

9

year and approximately 28°C in both districts, with slightly higher average rainfall per year

10

and temperature in Bagamoyo due to its coastal location. Above 70% of the residents in both

11

districts own pieces of land and majority of them engage in subsistence farming [19], [23].

12

The pattern of climatic conditions and land use are contributing factors toward the persistence

13

of the perennial breeding sites for mosquitoes and other diseases vectors [24].

Study Design

4

The study is a secondary analysis of two baseline cross-sectional surveys from a trial on

5

spatial repellents in Bagamoyo [25], and an insecticide residual spray (IRS) evaluation in

6

Ulanga [26]. The surveys were conducted randomly in nine villages in Bagamoyo district

7

from the year 2014 to 2015 and eight villages in Ulanga district from the year 2016 to 2017.

8

Household survey data collection

9

Data were collected using a structured questionnaire upon written informed consent from an

10

adult household member. The questionnaire surveyors collected information on ITN coverage

11

1

enough ITN for all sleeping spaces) [27] and 2) proportion of the population with at least 1

2

ITN for every 2 people that slept in the household on average [28].

3

Information was collected on demographic and socio-economic characteristics (age, sex,

4

household size, house structure, livestock ownership, asset ownership, source of light,

5

occupation, level of education, and presence of pregnant occupants), household geographical

6

coordinates (longitude, latitude and elevation) and house structure (wall materials, roof

7

materials, ceiling materials, opened or closed eaves, floor materials, number of windows, if

8

windows were screened, and number of outside doors were noted based on visual observation

9

by the interviewers). The surveys were delivered using similar questionnaires in the two sites

10

except that in Ulanga, data on age, sex and educational status of heads of households and the

11

geographical coordinates were not collected.

12

Data Management and Analysis

13

The paper questionnaires were double-entered using EpiData software [29] and analysis was

14

carried out using STATA 14.2 [30].

15

Socioeconomic status of each household was derived from a weighted score using principal

16

component analysis (PCA),

17

highest [31]. The binary outcomes of presence of window screens and presence of closed

18

eaves were analyzed using a logistic regression model, while the count outcomes, ITN access

19

and ITN per sleeping spaces were analysed using Poisson regression model. The associations

20

between the outcomes and the covariates, household size, age, sex, pregnancy, education,

21

mosquito entry (doors and windows), house modification (window screens and closed eaves),

22

mean distance to breeding site and socioeconomic quintiles were estimated. Village was

23

included in the regression model as a random effect to account for clustering. The age of the

categorized into quintiles: poorest, poor, middle, high and

heads of households was categorized into three levels: young adults “18-24”, adult “25-49”

2

and old adults “50-99”.

3

All covariates and interaction between education and wealth status were considered in the

analysis based on findings from past literature [32]–[37]. Indicator of ITN access and enough

each breeding sites was done by larval dipping (Adam Saddler pers. comm). Shapefiles for

2

the Tanzania districts were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) website

3

and the Ruvu river shapefile was extracted from OpenStreetMap [40]. The mean distance of

4

each surveyed households to breeding sites was categorized into two levels: ≤ 609.5 metres

5

and > 609.5 metres, maintaining the mean travel distance of culex [41], as it is noted that

6

most of the breeding sites contain Culex quinquefasciatus [42].

RESULTS

Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households

9

A total of 7,240 households in Bagamoyo and 1,241 in Ulanga districts were surveyed and

10

their demographic characteristics detailed [Additional file 1]. Roughly 28% [95% CI 27 – 30]

11

of households in Bagamoyo and 22% [16 – 29] in Ulanga consisted of more than five

12

members. From data only collected in Bagamoyo, fewer households (9% [8 – 10]) were

13

headed by young adults (18 to 24 years). There were more male headed households than

14

female (24% [21 – 27]) and most of the respondents had primary education (71% [66 – 76]).

15

The proportion of houses with more mosquito entries (windows and doors) were greater in

16

Bagamoyo (44% [39 – 49]) than Ulanga (26% [18 – 37]), indicating more larger houses and

17

wealthy households in Bagamoyo (23% [18 – 28]) than Ulanga (7% [5 – 11]). About 46% [6

18

- 91] of the houses in the population were located within a mean distance of 609.5 metres to a

19

mosquito breeding site (Table 1).

ITNs access in the population

6

Population access to ITNs (mean of households with an ITN for 2 potential users that stayed

7

in the house the previous night) was estimated as 64% [95% CI 56 – 71]. ITNs per sleeping

8

spaces (mean of households with enough ITNs to cover all sleeping spaces used the previous

night) was also estimated as 63% [54 – 72] in Bagamoyo after 3 years of mass campaign.

1

except in Ulanga where population access to ITN was 84% [78 – 91] and ITN per sleeping

2

spaces was 93% [89 – 97] after 1 year of mass campaign. Differences between ITN access in

3

the two locations are related to the timing of the survey.

4

Factors associated with ITNs coverage in Bagamoyo and Ulanga

5

Univariate analysis revealed that on access to ITN was on average lower among households

6

with fewer people and which head of house was younger, male, had little formal education,

7

and poor, as well as in houses that had fewer number of windows and doors, and far from a

8

breeding site in Bagamoyo and only lower among households with fewer people in Ulanga.

9

While in multivariable analysis, all factors estimated were not significantly associated with

10

access to ITNs except household size (Table 2). The consistent determinant of access to ITN

11

was larger household size.

12

Similar to access to ITNs, on average enough ITNs per sleeping spaces was less common in

13

Bagamoyo among poor households whose head had no formal education, as well as houses

14

with fewer numbers of doors and windows located above 609.5 metres from a breeding site in

15

the univariate analysis. However, there were no significant differences among the

16

demographic and socioeconomic factors regarding ITNs per sleeping spaces in both

17

Bagamoyo and Ulanga in the multivariable analysis (Table 3). Most households had even

18

distribution of ITNs per sleeping spaces on average.

19

Association of other covariates access to ITNs and ITNs per sleeping spaces were not

20

statistically significant in the univariate analysis [Additional file 2] and multivariable analysis

21

[Additional file 3].

Use of house modifications (window screens and closed eaves) in the population

2

Of the households visually observed for house modification, 61% [46 - 74] had window

3

screens in Bagamoyo, while only 12% [8 - 17] had window screens in Ulanga. Some houses

4

had closed eaves, 14% [10 - 20] of houses in Bagamoyo and 55% [45 - 64] in Ulanga. About

5

half (49% [38 - 59]) of the sampled houses with screened windows in Bagamoyo also used an

6

ITN and in Ulanga, 53% [44 - 63] of houses with closed eaves used an ITN. However, the

7

proportion of houses in both districts with the combination of screened windows and closed

8

eaves that reported use of an ITN the previous night of the surveys was less than 10%.

9

Factors that are associated with the use of house modification in the population

10

In the univariate analysis, use of window screens was lower in poor houses in which head of

11

household was older, female and had little education as well as houses with lower numbers of

12

doors and windows close to a breeding site in Bagamoyo. Similar results were found in

13

Ulanga, except that houses with fewer members were less likely to have a window screens.

14

Of these findings, only household size, age and wealth of head of household, mosquito entry

15

(higher numbers of doors and windows) and mean distance to breeding sites were strongly

16

associated with the use window screens in both Bagamoyo and Ulanga in the multivariable

17

analysis (Table 4).

18

Larger households and those headed by older individuals, female and in the poor quintile

19

were less likely to use closed eaves in Bagamoyo and similarly in Ulanga, except that

20

households in the rich quintile had low usage of closed eaves in the univariate analysis.

21

Although, only wealth and gender were significantly associated with the use of closed eaves,

22

the proportion of houses with closed eaves was lower among poor households headed by

23

make in Bagamoyo and higher in Ulanga as the poor households blocked their eaves with

24

mud the multivariable analysis (Table 5). Other co-variates explored were not statistically

DISCUSSION

2

ITNs coverage in the population

3

Population access to ITNs after 3 years of mass distribution was lower than targets of the

4

Tanzania National Malaria Strategic Plan. The difference between the access to ITNs in

5

Bagamoyo and Ulanga (64% vs 84%) estimates that access declines at an average of 10%

6

after the first year, this suggests that a minimum interval of two years ITN distribution

7

campaigns is necessary to maintain high coverage of ITN, this is a concern as the average

8

interval between campaigns in Tanzania is at least 4 years. Population access to ITNs is a

9

more robust indicator of measuring ITN coverage [28] and was lower among large

10

households even in Ulanga where the survey was conducted shortly after residents received

11

ITNs from the national campaign. This finding has also been observed in the lake region of

12

Tanzania where household numbers are on average larger, (Ikupa Akim pers. comm).

13

Therefore our study also demonstrates that limiting the number of ITNs distribution by not

14

necessarily taking into account individual household size in the population will continue to

15

serve as hindrance to achieving high ITN coverage [28]. The Universal Coverage Campaign

16

(UCC) implemented in Tanzania to cover all sleeping spaces [4] resulted in a higher access

17

measured by ITNs per sleeping spaces (93%) rather than access to ITNs (84%) in Ulanga,

18

this demonstrates that more than two people are using a single sleeping space. This is

19

consistent as it was found that larger households had more children (< 5 years old), who were

20

more likely to share sleeping space with their parent or a sleeping space occupied by more

21

than two children. This has been found to decrease the durability of ITNs due to stretching of

22

the net resulting in damage [43], [44]. Additional efforts are required to improve household

23

access in order to maintain effective malaria control seen in previous years due to universal

24

ITN coverage campaigns.

1

Family size is an important factor that needs to be considered when planning ITNs

2

distribution campaigns. The last campaign in Tanzania achieved high coverage in Ulanga,

3

considering the indicator of population access to ITNs, but it is necessary to ensure that the

4

ITNs are actually where they are most needed, and in sufficient number in the larger

5

households which are most likely to have the most malaria vulnerable groups (children under

6

5 and pregnant women). Mosquitoes are more attracted to households with an increased

7

number of people [45], thus households with larger family size need to have adequate ITNs to

8

impact malaria. ITNs distribution in schools may be a good idea for a keep up strategy [46].

9

School age children tend to have lowest access to ITNs [47], which emphasizes the utility of

10

the school nets program in Tanzania. The slight influence of wealth was observed in

11

Bagamoyo, which may suggest that rich people purchased ITNs when the ones they were

12

given

13

Communication (BCC) strategy at the community level may be targeted towards all

14

households to encourage care of ITN to last longer and continue the usage of damaged ITNs

15

as against discarding while waiting for campaigns, as it has been shown that damaged nets

16

remain insecticidal [48]. It is clear, however that more effort is needed in improving access to

17

ITNs.

18

House modification in the population

19

A possible explanation for the higher usage of window screens in Bagamoyo could be

20

attributed to more economic development and availability of low cost screening as reported

21

in a study conducted in Dar es Salaam – close proximity to study area [15], as compared to

22

Ulanga, a remote rural area with low income and lack of access to window screening

23

suppliers. Building materials are likely to be more expensive far from economic centres due

24

to transport cost. The majority of the houses in Bagamoyo had opened eaves possibly due to

25

low awareness of closed eaves as a tool to reduce indoor mosquito density [12] and high

the

non-functional.

1

temperature during the daytime as found in neighbouring coastal Kenya (Mombasa) [49]. The

2

use of open eaves is an efficient means of cooling houses [11] which is also a plausible

3

explanation for the observed pattern, especially since Bagamoyo has an average temperature

4

2oC higher and greater humidity than Ulanga due to its proximity to the ocean. Wealthy

5

households in Bagamoyo were more likely to have closed eaves where window screens were

6

also in common use, while in Ulanga, the poorest households were more likely to close their

7

eaves but were unable to afford window screens that gives protection from mosquitoes [50].

8

As window screening is clearly a function of wealth, it would be prudent for screens to

9

receive a subsidy and for insecticide treated screens to be made more widely available as a

10

long-term vector control intervention to protect individual users as well as the community –

11

through killing vectors that contact the screens. The acceptance of closed eaves in the rural

12

areas do not seem worrisome as it is already a common housing structure among modern

13

houses owned by wealthy people in Tanzania [51]. However, in houses with indoor fires,

14

mostly found in the remote areas, closing eaves is not advisable as may increase exposure to

15

biomass particulate matter and induce respiratory illness [52]. There is evidence of high

16

densities of indoor mosquitoes in houses with more entry points [16], which has led to the

17

observed increased use of window screens in the population as the number of windows and

18

doors increases.

19

Households headed by young individuals had more window screens installed. This group had

20

more years of formal education and were wealthier than the older age group, as access to

21

education in Tanzania has steadily improved over the last decades [53]. This might have

22

made them more knowledgeable about the importance of the tool in preventing indoor

23

mosquito entry and their wealth afforded them the opportunity to install them in their houses.

24

Window screens are useful because they 1) require no compliance, 2) tend to be long-lasting

25

and 3) protect all members of a household. This also serves as an indicator that younger

1

people are adaptive to the uptake of new tools for controlling malaria. However, the use of

2

window screens alone is not sufficient to control malaria [54]. The incorporation of

3

insecticides into window screens would improve the efficacy of this tool against mosquitoes

4

as it has improved the protective efficacy of conventional bednets and other vector control

5

tools [55]. In addition, It is logical that maximising the concurrent use of multiple vector

6

control tools, i.e. combination of ITNs and insecticidal house screening may assist in

7

transiting the current malaria phase in Tanzania to elimination [56], [57] and may also protect

8

against other vector-borne disease such as dengue [10].

9

The study area in Tanzania provides conducive breeding sites based on ecological conditions

10

and human behaviour, hence high mosquito density notable for nuisance biting [58]. Our

11

study found that window screens were less common among households at an average of

12

609.5 metres to a breeding site. This is because the poorest households were located at closer

13

proximity to breeding sites and couldn’t afford the installation of window screens, which

14

means that poorer households are exposed to higher risk of mosquito bites. It is reported in

15

another study conducted in Tanzania that most of the breeding sites contain Culex

16

quinquefasciatus which are notable for nuisance biting [42] and transmission of other human

17

pathogens such as viruses and filarial worms [59]. This supports the essence of providing a

18

subsidy for window screens to reduce the exposure of the poor households to vector-borne

19

diseases.

Our study was affected by non-response bias as shown in Figure 3 and desirability bias, that

22

might have influenced ITNs access estimates [60]. It was suspected that respondents denied

23

owning at least one ITN in the household due to an expectation of compensation in the form

24

of ITNs after the study. Therefore, it was necessary to use number of ITNs reported to be

used the previous night as a proxy for ownership, it was more adequately measured as

2

interviewers asked the use of each ITN in respect to where it was used in the household.

3

Ideally, surveys of ITN access should visually inspect the presence of nets in households

4

whenever possible to reduce the possibility of respondents giving misleading answers. The

5

study was unable to establish a detailed comparison between the study areas because the age,

6

sex and educational status of head of households as well as the geocoordinates of the

7

breeding sites in Ulanga district were not collected. Nevertheless, the study recruited a very

8

large number of participants which gave the study strong power to correctly establish

9

association between the outcomes and covariates. House structures which included window

10

screens and closed eaves were visually recorded by interviewers, and thus accurately

11

observed.

12

CONCLUSION

13

This study demonstrates the need to improve access to ITNs especially among larger

14

households in the population, due to the fact that access already dropped within 3 years of

15

distribution and among larger family even just after recent government distribution. Our

16

study suggests that large family households should be specially targeted in keep-up and

17

universal coverage campaigns. It is evident in the study that the wider use of window screens

18

could largely be improved by government subsidies. Therefore, it is necessary to put

19

strategies in place to improve access to window screens widely through low cost screens and

20

insecticidal screens to maximise the use of the combination of ITNs and insecticidal house

21

screening to further control malaria as well as other vector-borne diseases.
