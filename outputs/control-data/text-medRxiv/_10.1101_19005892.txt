ABSTRACT
Importance: The causality of the association between physical activity and risk of breast and
endometrial cancers is uncertain because available evidence is based exclusively on
observational studies, which are potentially susceptible to confounding and reverse
causation.
Objective: To investigate whether increased physical activity is causally associated with
decreased risk of breast and endometrial cancers, using a two-sample Mendelian
randomization study design.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Genome-wide association studies of physical activity,
breast cancer, and endometrial cancer, published up to April 31, 2019, were identified using
PubMed and the GWAS catalog. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) known at P
< 5 x 10-8 to be associated with accelerometer-assessed or self-reported physical activity
served as instrumental variables. Genetic summary data from four large consortia provided
SNP-outcome associations [Breast Cancer Association Consortium; Discovery, Biology and
Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer Consortium; Endometrial Cancer Association
Consortium].
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were risk of breast cancer and risk
of endometrial cancer. Secondary outcomes were estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ERbreast cancers. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per mean acceleration
in milli-gravities of accelerometer-assessed physical activity and per one standard deviation
(1-SD) increase in metabolic-equivalent (MET)-minutes/week of self-reported moderate-tovigorous physical activity were computed using the inverse variance weighted method. A
series of sensitivity analyses addressed the potential impact of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and
outliers.
Results: Summary data were available for 122,977 breast cancers and 12,270 endometrial
cancers. Genetic predisposition to increased accelerometer-assessed physical activity was
associated with lower risk of breast and endometrial cancers. The associations (ORs [95%
CI] per 1-SD increase in mean acceleration) were 0.88 (0.85-0.91) for breast cancer and

0.90 (0.83-0.97) for endometrial cancer. In addition, genetic predisposition to increased
accelerometer-assessed physical activity was associated with lower risk of ER+ breast
cancer. We found no evidence for an association between genetic predisposition to selfreported physical activity and risk of total breast cancer, breast cancer subtypes, or
endometrial cancer.
Conclusion and Relevance: This first Mendelian randomization study shows that
objectively-assessed physical activity plays a causal role in protecting against breast and
endometrial cancers.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy and endometrial cancer is the sixth
most common female malignancy in high-income countries 1. Given the large burden of
breast and endometrial cancers, it is imperative to identify modifiable risk factors for effective
prevention. For example, several non-genetic risk factors have been established for
endometrial cancer, including obesity, insulin resistance, and certain reproductive factors 2.
Although the causality of some of those factors, such as obesity 2,3, is well accepted,
relations with other potential risk factors remain uncertain.
The association between physical activity and risk of breast and endometrial cancers has
received considerable attention in recent years, with umbrella reviews and meta-analyses of
observational studies providing evidence for protective associations with both breast cancer
4-6

and endometrial cancer 2,6,7. Those associations have been confirmed by reports of the

World Cancer Research Fund 3 and the 2018 U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory
Committee 8. All of the evidence underpinning physical activity guidelines has come from
observational studies linking physical activity data to cancer risk 8. However, observational
studies often cannot distinguish true, causal associations from artefactual associations that
may be a consequence of confounding or reverse causation 9.
By comparison, randomized controlled trials can provide unequivocal evidence for causality,
but are often infeasible given the long latency periods for many cancers 10. Genetic variants
can be useful to infer causality because they are present from birth and are therefore unlikely
to be confounded by environmental factors 11. Mendelian randomization is a method that
uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to uncover causal relationships in the
presence of observational study bias 11. Previous Mendelian randomization studies have
confirmed obesity as a causal risk factor in the development of both breast and endometrial
cancers 12-14. In the current study, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization
analyses to assess the causal association of physical activity with risk of breast and
endometrial cancers.

Methods
The current study design comprised of three components: (1) identification of genetic variants
to serve as instrumental variables for physical activity; (2) acquisition of summary data for the
genetic instruments from genome-wide association studies on physical activity; (3) acquisition
of instrumenting SNP-outcome summary data from genome-wide association studies of breast
cancer and endometrial cancer.
Selection of Instrumental Variables for Physical Activity
We searched the GWAS catalog 15 and PubMed for studies published up to April 31, 2019, to
identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with physical activity (eTable 1).
We used a previous genome-wide association study of 91,084 UK Biobank participants that
identified three SNPs associated with accelerometer-assessed physical activity (mean
acceleration in milli-gravities) at genome-wide significance (P < 5x10-8)

16

. We also used nine

SNPs previously associated with 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in metabolic-equivalent
(MET)-minutes/week of self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at genome-wide
significance in 377,234 individuals

. The estimated ‘Chip-heritability’ for accelerometer-

16

assessed and self-reported physical activity was 14% and 5%, respectively 16.
Outcome Data
We used publicly available summary statistics data for genetic associations with breast
cancer and endometrial cancer 17,18. Specifically, the meta-analysis of genome-wide
association studies of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium and the Discovery, Biology
and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer Consortium included data from 122,977
female cases and 105,974 female controls of European descent 17. Cases were subtyped
according to estrogen receptor (ER) positive (n = 69,501) and ER negative status (n=
21,468). The Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium provided summary statistics for
from their recent genome-wide association meta-analysis 18 with the UK Biobank strata
removed (total dataset 12,270 endometrial cancer cases and 46,126 controls of European

descent) (eTable 2). The study consortia data for breast cancer did not include the UK
Biobank.
Statistical analysis
The principal analysis was conducted using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method,
under a fixed effects model, alongside other methods to overcome violations of specific
instrumental variable assumptions: weighted median, MR-Egger and MR-Pleiotropy
RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) 19,20. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per mean acceleration in milli-gravities of accelerometerassessed physical activity and per 1-SD increase in MET-minutes/week of self-reported
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. We used the Cochran Q statistic to test for
heterogeneity 19,21. Higher levels of heterogeneity in the estimated effects from each SNP
indicate potential pleiotropy, which potentially introduces bias in Mendelian randomization
estimation 21. We performed leave-one-out analyses for accelerometer-based and selfreported activity to address potential heterogeneity. We assessed potential directional
pleiotropy by testing the intercepts of MR-Egger models 19. Analyses were performed using
the TwoSampleMR (version 0.4.22) 20 and MR-PRESSO (version 1.0) packages in R
(version 3.5.3).
Results
Mendelian randomization analyses revealed inverse associations of accelerometer-assessed
physical activity with both breast and endometrial cancers. Specifically, genetically predicted
accelerometer-assessed physical activity was associated with a 12% lower odds of breast
cancer (IVW OR per mean acceleration in milli-gravities: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85-0.91, P=5.7x1016

) (Table 1). Analyses according to breast cancer subtype showed an inverse relationship of

accelerometer-assessed physical activity to ER+ breast cancer (IVW OR: 0.86; 95% CI:
0.83-0.89; P=1.7x10-15) but no association with ER- breast cancer (IVW OR 0.99; 95% CI:
0.94-1.05; P=.788). Genetically predicted accelerometer-assessed physical activity was also
associated with a 10% lower odds of endometrial cancer (IVW OR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83-0.97,

P=6.5x10-3) (Table 1). By comparison, genetically predicted self-reported physical activity
showed no associations with total breast cancer, ER+ breast cancer, ER- breast cancer, or
endometrial cancer (Table 2).
We performed sensitivity analyses to examine potential pleiotropy and outliers. The Cochran
Q statistics indicated horizontal pleiotropy for the associations of accelerometer-assessed
physical activity with total breast cancer and ER+ breast cancer, but not with ER- breast
cancer and endometrial cancer (eTables 3). Analyses also suggested horizontal pleiotropy
for the relations of self-reported activity to overall breast cancer and endometrial cancer
(eTables 3). Results from the leave-one-out analyses of accelerometer-assessed and selfreported activity did not substantially alter the results (eTables 4 and 5). There was no
indication of directional pleiotropy (all P >.21, eTable 6). MR-PRESSO did not detect any
outlier for models of self-reported physical activity in relation to breast cancer, but it detected
two outliers (rs2854277, rs429358) for models of self-reported physical activity in relation to
endometrial cancer (Table 1). Due to the limited number of available SNPs, MR-PRESSO
was not performed for accelerometer-assessed physical activity.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the current study represents the first Mendelian randomization
analysis of genetically determined and objectively assessed physical activity in relation to
cancer risk. Our investigation provides strong support for causal inverse associations
between accelerometer-assessed physical activity and risks of breast and endometrial
cancers. Specifically, our analyses show that an increase in genetically determined,
accelerometer-assessed physical activity is associated with a 12% lower risk of breast
cancer and a 10% lower risk of endometrial cancer. We also detected a 14% risk reduction
for ER+ breast cancer associated with an increase in genetically determined, accelerometerassessed physical activity. By comparison, we found no association between genetically
determined, accelerometer-assessed physical activity and ER- breast cancer. In addition, we

found no associations between genetically determined, self-reported physical activity and
risks of breast or endometrial cancers.
Our findings are largely consistent with previous prospective observational investigations of
physical activity and risk of breast and endometrial cancers 4-8. A large pooled analysis of 10
European and US cohort studies including 35,178 breast cancer cases reported a risk
reduction of 10% comparing high versus low levels of self-reported physical activity (hazard
ratio: 0.90; 95%: 0.87-0.93) 22. Similarly, the most comprehensive available meta-analysis of
self-reported physical activity and breast cancer comprising 38 prospective studies and
116,304 breast cancer cases found that the highest compared to the lowest level of physical
activity was associated with a 12% risk reduction (relative risk: 0.88; 95%: 0.85-0.90) 5. In
addition, high versus low self-reported physical activity was associated with a 11% reduced
risk of ER+ breast cancer (relative risk: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83-0.95) 5. A pooled analysis of nine
cohort studies including 5,347 endometrial cancer cases reported a risk reduction of 21%
(hazard ratio: 0.79; 95 CI: 0.68-0.92) for high versus low self-reported physical activity 22. A
recent meta-analysis found a 20% reduction in risk of endometrial cancer when comparing
the highest versus the lowest amounts of self-reported physical activity (relative risk: 0.80; 95
CI: 0.75-0.85) 7. Of note, although our Mendelian randomization estimates are similar in
magnitude to those obtained from pooled analyses and meta-analyses of previous
observational studies, Mendelian randomization investigations generally provide estimates of
cumulative, long term exposure, whereas risk estimates from observational studies more
typically reflect recent past or current levels of physical activity 23.
Numerous investigations have evaluated physical activity in relation to breast and
endometrial cancers but previous studies have relied exclusively on observational study
designs. Therefore, it has been difficult to discern whether associations between physical
activity and cancer risk are truly causal 9. The ongoing debate about whether physical activity
causally protects from cancer has in part been inconclusive due to a lack of instrumental
variables 9. The current Mendelian randomization study closes this gap by utilizing newly

available instrumental variables, thereby improving causal inference and overcoming
potential biases of traditional observational studies 11.
Mendelian randomization studies have shown that physical activity lowers the risk of
adiposity 24 and that obesity increases risks of breast and endometrial cancers

12-14,25

, which

led us to hypothesize that physical activity causally acts as a protective factor for breast and
endometrial cancers. The validity of the causal estimates derived from Mendelian
randomization approaches requires several assumptions to be satisfied 11. When the genetic
variants selected as instrumental variables are unassociated with potential confounders and
are not linked to the outcome via any alternative pathway, Mendelian randomization analysis
provides evidence for rejecting the sharp causal null hypothesis of no effect of the exposure
of interest 11,26. We selected the most significant independent SNPs as instrumental variables
such that all SNPs were robustly associated with physical activity. However, although we
used the largest genome-wide association study available, only few genome-wide significant
instrumenting SNPs were available, leading to wide CIs of the risk estimates.
A major assumption underlying the validity of our Mendelian randomization analysis was that
the genetic variant affects breast or endometrial cancer only through physical activity. We
conducted a large range of statistical analyses to rule out potential pleiotropy and we applied
methods that are particularly robust to horizontal pleiotropy. Although horizontal pleiotropy
biases Mendelian randomization estimates, vertical pleiotropy (where the instrument affects
a mediator along the causal pathway) does not 11,19. For example, although it is often
assumed that obesity mediates the inverse association between physical activity and cancer
risk (vertical pleiotropy), obesity could also confound that association by rendering physical
activity difficult to perform (horizontal pleiotropy) 9. We performed sensitivity analyses to
address horizontal pleiotropy and found that the exclusion of potentially pleiotropic SNPs did
not alter our main findings.
In order for the two-sample Mendelian randomization method to be valid, the two analytic
samples should derive from the same underlying population. The discovery genome-wide
association study of physical activity consisted of UK Biobank participants of European

descent, aged 40 to 70 years 16. Data on sex-specific SNP-physical activity associations
were unavailable. By comparison, SNP-outcome associations were derived from female
samples with an age range broader than 40 to 70 years. Given the limited age range of the
UK Biobank and inclusion of European ancestry individuals only, our results may not be
generalizable to other age groups or ancestral populations. Therefore, replication of our
findings in other age groups and non-European populations is warranted. By using nonspecific effects, our analyses assumed that the effects of SNPs on physical activity are not
sex-specific and do not vary by age. We expect sex differences were small for the majority of
associations. Thus, our Mendelian randomization analysis estimated the risks of breast and
endometrial cancers resulting from “life-long” exposure to physical activity-increasing SNPs,
which is the effect of the genetic variant determined at conception and assumes that the
association between the genetic variants accumulates over time and does not change with
age 23. However, this may not be an entirely tenable assumption given that the heritability of
physical activity has been shown to decrease with age 27.
Because available data on SNPs associated with physical activity were limited to moderateto-vigorous physical activity, we were unable to consider specific types, durations, or
frequencies of physical activity. Our analyses showed that accelerometer-assessed physical
activity was related to reduced risks of breast and endometrial cancers, whereas selfreported physical activity yielded null associations. One explanation for this finding is that
objective measures of physical activity show less random variation than do subjective
measures 28, which may have generated more precise estimates of accelerometer-assessed
as opposed to self-reported physical activity. Furthermore, because some genetic loci for
self-reported physical activity are also related to cognitive function, self-reported physical
activity measures may be prone to information bias 16,29. In contrast, associations based on
accelerometer-assessed physical activity are unrelated to cognitive performance, which
essentially rules out any impact cognitive biases could have had on our results 16,29.
In conclusion, our Mendelian randomization study suggests that increased physical activity is
causally related to decreased risk of breast and endometrial cancers. Our results, in

combination with previous literature, provide strong evidence that increased physical activity
plays an important role in the prevention of breast cancer and endometrial cancer. Future
research may identify if the effects of physical activity vary with age to identify critical time
windows for designing prevention strategies.
