ABSTRACT
Objectives
The diagnosis of repeat syphilis and its follow-up remains challenging. We aimed to
investigate if IgM testing may assist in the diagnosis of syphilis reinfection/relapse and its
treatment follow-up.
Methods
Sera were collected from 120 individuals with a new diagnosis of syphilis (72 with repeat
infections) and 30 syphilis negative controls during a cohort study investigating syphilis
biomarkers conducted at a STI/HIV clinic in Antwerp, Belgium. Syphilis was diagnosed
based on a simultaneous positive treponemal and non-treponemal assay result and/or
positive serum PCR targeting polA. Specimens collected at visit of diagnosis, and 3 and 6
months post-treatment were tested by two enzyme immuno assays (EIAs), recomWell
(Mikrogen; MI) and Euroimmun (EU), to detect anti-treponemal IgM. Baseline specimens
were also tested for anti-treponemal IgM using a line immuno assay (LIA) recomLine
(Mikrogen). Quantitative kinetic decay curves were constructed from the longitudinal
quantitative EIA results.
Results
An overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of syphilis of 59.8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI):
50.3-68.7), 75.0 % (95 %(CI): 66.1-82.3) and 64.2 % (95 %(CI): 54.8-72.6) was obtained for
the EU, MI EIAs, and MI LIA, respectively. When only considering repeat syphilis, the
diagnostic sensitivity decreased to 45.7 % (95 %(CI): 33.9-58.0), 63.9 % (95 %(CI): 51.774.6) and 47.2 % (95 %(CI): 35.5-59.3), respectively. IgM seroreverted in most cases 6
months after treatment. Post-treatment IgM concentrations decreased 30 % faster for initial
syphilis compared to repeat infection. The IgM EIAs and IgM LIA agreed from fairly to
moderately (Cohen’s kappa (κ): 0.36 [EU EIA]; κ: 0.53 [MI EIA]; κ: 0.40 [MI LIA]) with the
diagnosis of syphilis.

INTRODUCTION
Syphilis has reemerged during the last 15 years as a major public health problem with
increasing incidence particularly amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) in the
northern hemisphere. [1] It is a multistage chronic disease caused by Treponema pallidum
subspecies pallidum, and can be challenging to diagnose, especially very early and repeat
infections. Diagnostic strategies remain reliant on serological testing, however, deficiencies
in assay performance and persistent anti-treponemal antibody presence following initial
infection often hamper diagnostic accuracy. [2]

As the epidemics progress, an increasing proportion of all infections have been noted to be
reinfections. [3] Since reinfections are more likely to present asymptomatically [4,5], timely
diagnosis depends on the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests.

Since treponemal tests (TT) remain positive for life, the diagnosis of reinfections typically
depends on fourfold or greater rises in non-treponemal test (NTT) titers, such as the Rapid
Plasma Reagin (RPR) test. Conversely, a fourfold decline in NTT titers is used to determine
the success of syphilis treatment. Due to the aspecific nature of NTTs, that relies on
antibody binding to lipoidal components released during host cell destruction and also
present in low quantities in the T. pallidum cell wall [6], other biological, infectious or
immunological mechanisms can also result in fluctuations in NTT leading to false positive
results. [7]

Following an initial infection, immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies are the first class of
antibodies produced. Early detection of IgM could therefore help with the diagnosis of early
syphilis. Current European syphilis guidelines [8] mention that IgM testing is useful in the
assessment of newborns and cerebral spinal fluid. These guidelines also note that a

negative IgM result cannot exclude the diagnosis of congenital or neurosyphilis. A study
published in 2013 [9] evaluated three commercially available IgM enzyme immune assays
(EIAs) using 307 serum samples from individuals with active syphilis. It found that these IgM
assays had a median sensitivity of 84.5 % with specificities in the range of 91.4 - 100 %. In
23/59 (39 %) of cases the IgM EIA test was positive in suspected very early infection where
the NTT was negative. A recently published prospective analysis of IgM among a cohort of
MSM demonstrated generally low EIA IgM test performance for repeat syphilis diagnosis,
namely only 38.5 % of repeat syphilis cases were diagnosed correctly with IgM testing [10].
The number of patients with repeat syphilis in the study was only 13.

In this study we investigated the clinical utility of IgM detection in the diagnosis of syphilis
and post-treatment follow-up in a prospective cohort of 120 individuals with a new episode of
syphilis. In addition we evaluated the performance of three commercially i.e. two EIAs and
one Line Immmuno Assay (LIA), IgM assays.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This sub-study was conducted in the context of a syphilis biomarker discovery study
(ClinicalTrials.gov Nr: NCT02059525). Potentially eligible study participants 18 years or
older, in whom a new syphilis diagnosis was made, were consecutively screened and
prospectively recruited between January 2014 and August 2015 at a sexually transmitted
infection/ HIV clinic in Antwerp, Belgium. Study exclusion criteria were the use of betalactam, doxycycline or macrolide antibiotics during the 28 days preceding enrollment.
Syphilis diagnosis and disease staging was performed according to the Centers for Disease
Control guidelines. [11] Reinfection was defined as previously described. [3] Stageappropriate treatment was administered according to European guidelines. [12] All
participants with syphilis were followed-up at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. The study

physician recorded clinical details and laboratory results in a standardized fashion during
each study visit. HIV-infected controls with both negative NTT and TT results were included
during the same recruitment period.

Clinical serological testing during routine workout
Blood was drawn into serum gel tubes (Sarstedt Monovette, Nümbrecht, Germany). Sera
were divided and either 1) stored at 4-8 °C until routine syphilis serological testing within four
days or 2) stored at -80 °C within three hours for later testing. Routine serological testing
included Macro-Vue RPR Card (RPR) (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, United States (US))
and TPA assay (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY, US) testing following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Positive RPR results were determined to a titer endpoint.
Sera obtained at baseline were also tested with the SERODIA-TPPA (Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo,
Japan) assay and an in-house T. pallidum PCR targeting polA. [13]

EIA and LIA testing for IgM serum antibodies
In order to investigate if assays from different manufacturers or using another method
performed differently and thus would have an impact on our study outcome, we evaluated
side by side two IgM EIAs and one LIA.
The anti-Treponema pallidum IgM EIAs were provided by Euroimmun (Lübeck, Germany)
and by Mikrogen GmbH (Neuried, Germany), henceforth referred to as ‘EU EIA’ and ‘MI
EIA’, respectively. Both assays use microplate wells coated with a mixture of four antigens of
T. pallidum: Tp15, Tp17, Tp47 and TmpA. Testing was performed following the
manufacturer’s

instructions

(EI_2111M_A_UK_C07.doc;

version:

08/09/2011

and

GIRETP011DE.doc; version April 2010). All quantitative EIA results were expressed in
International Units (IU)/mL.
The recomLine Treponema line immune assay (LIA) kit (MI LIA) (Mikrogen GmbH) was used
for the qualitative determination of the IgM antibodies for baseline samples. This test uses
recombinant T. pallidum antigens fixed on nitrocellulose membrane strips. Testing was

performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GARLTP002EN, version 2012/08).
Objective reading of the strips was done by scanning the strips with a flatbed scanner and
analysis software Recomscan (Mikrogen). The density of the antigen was compared to a
positive control and ratio’s were calculated. The assay was reported negative of no antigen
was detected ( ratio <1), was borderline only one random antigen was detected (ratio ≥ 1)
and positive if at least two random antigens were present (ratio ≥ 1).

Quality control
The samples were analyzed by a research and diagnostic laboratory unit, both are
ISO15189 accredited. One single lotnumber was used for all EIAs and LIAs. Two laboratory
technicians performed the analyses during two batch testing periods of 14 days in 2016.
Evaluative testing of the EIAs took place maximum 974 days after the samples of interest
were collected. Samples were thawed, tested and refrozen on the same day with a
maximum of two freeze thaw cycles.
Due to the prolonged testing period and nature of the routine diagnostic laboratory setting,
the reagents used for the TPPA, TPA and RPR tests were from different lot numbers.
The laboratory technicians were blinded from the patient’s clinical information and any other
syphilis serology result.
Data was manually double entered into the database.

Statistical analysis
In the absence of a single gold standard test for syphilis, a positive RPR test, or in the case
of reinfection a four-fold increase in RPR titer, together with a positive TPPA/TPA results or
a positive T. pallidum PCR test were used to define a new syphilis episode (‘syphilis
diagnosis’).
Percentage agreement and Cohen’s kappa (κ)-coefficient value [14] were calculated to
estimate agreement between the IgM test results. The sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV)

and negative (NPV) predictive values with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
using the baseline visit samples. Borderline results for the EIA and LIA testing were included
for the first set of analyses as negative (specific scenario) and the second dataset included
all borderline results as positive (sensitive scenario).
Continuous variables were expressed as median values and interquartile range (IQR).
Associations between categorical variables were assessed with the chi-squared test (χ2) and
Fisher’s exact test for small numbers. A student t-test was performed to compare the
quantitative results of the IgM assays between initial and repeat syphilis groups. Analyses
were performed in Stata 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, US). The statistical
significance level was set at 0.05.
Non-linear models were used to visually assess the decay of the IgM concentrations and
RPR titers over time. The exponential decay curves were of the form Y = a*e -b*X, where Y
was the measurement of the EIA tests and X the time in months. The exponential decay
curves and the graphics were designed using R version 3.4.4. [15]

RESULTS
Study participants
In total 150 individuals were included in the study, 120 diagnosed with syphilis and 30
controls. [16] Study subject characteristics are described in Table 1. Of those who had
active syphilis at the time of study enrollment 48/120 (40 %) presented with a first episode of
syphilis (henceforth referred to as ‘initial infection’) and 72/120 (60 %) presented with a
repeat infection. Previous NTT results were available for 107/120, the remaining 13
individuals without previous serological test results were classified as having an initial
infection based on the fact that they had never had a diagnosis of or symptoms suggestive
of syphilis before. Initial infections were more often symptomatic 34/48 (71 %) compared to
the repeat infections 39/72 (54 %) (P = 0.09). [5]

IgM test performs suboptimally for diagnosis of syphilis
The overall diagnostic performance for the two IgM EIAs and LIA assays evaluated was
moderate. Table 3 summarizes the assay performances in the specific case scenario. The
diagnostic sensitivities of the evaluated assays ranged from 80.9 % to 91.7 % when applied
to samples collected at baseline from individuals with initial syphilis. When baseline analyses
were stratified per initial or repeat infection, the diagnostic sensitivity decreased significantly
in repeat infections for all assays evaluated compared to initial infection (P=0.002 (MI EIA);
P=0.003 (EU EIA);P<0.0001 LIA MI).

LIA IgM testing of baseline samples
The overall performance of the LIA test was moderate (Table 2 & 3). Of the six antigen lines
evaluated, Tp47 and TmpA were the most frequently positive. No samples were positive for
the marker Tp257. A heat map was created comparing the RPR titer and MI LIA
(Supplementary figure S2).

Quantitative assessment of baseline samples with EIA
When considering the quantitative results of the two EIAs, a significant difference was found
between the initial and repeat syphilis groups (EU P < 0.001; MI P = 0.001) with repeat
syphilis having lower IgM concentrations. Moreover, the concentrations were significantly

lower for individuals presenting with latent stage syphilis compared to primary and
secondary stage (EU EIA P = 0.02; MI EIA P = 0.004).

Longitudinal post-treatment follow-up at 3- and 6- month and kinetic decay
curve characteristics of EIA testing
At 6 months post-treatment seroreversion of IgM test results occurred in 57/70 (81 %)
samples tested by the EU EIA and 66/90 (73 %) tested by MI EIA. Among the month 6
samples for which a seroreversion was not observed, 6/13 and 7/24 tested with the EU EIA
and MI EIA, respectively, did not show a decrease in RPR titer either. Overall, in a total of 19
individuals a decrease in RPR titer post-treatment was not observed. Individuals with an
initial syphilis infection demonstrated a faster decrease in analyte concentration for every
additional time unit (0.55 (95 % CI: 0.36 – 0.68)) compared to a repeat syphilis (0.74 (95 %
CI: 0.62 – 0.83))(Figure 1).

and RPR titers over time.

Agreement between the commercial IgM tests
The overall agreement was substantial between the two EIA tests when considering all
samples i.e. samples from baseline, M3, and M6, tested by both assays (N = 339). The
Cohen’s kappa was κ: 0.69 (85.3 %) and κ: 0.74 (86.7 %) for the specific-case and sensitivecase scenarios, respectively.
There was a strong agreement between the LIA and the EIAs: 90.7 % (κ: 0.81) between the
MI EIA and MI LIA, and 95.3 % (κ: 0.91) between EU EIA and MI LIA in the specific-case
scenario. In the sensitive-case scenario the agreement between MI EIA and MI LIA
increased further up to 99.3 % (κ: 0.91) but decreased between EU EIA and MI LIA to 88.7
% (κ: 0.77).

DISCUSSION
We aimed to determine whether testing for IgM could aid in the diagnosis of new syphilis
infections, including repeat infections, and if it could be useful for post-treatment follow-up.
Detection of IgM may help in the diagnosis of syphilis but its diagnostic sensitivity is poor, it
was notably low in participants diagnosed with repeat syphilis. Our results are, however,
congruent with previous reports of suboptimal IgM test performance overall and for repeat
syphilis in particular. [10] The lower diagnostic sensitivity of IgM in repeat syphilis is
compatible with results from other infections where reinfections lead directly to increases in
IgG without initial increases in IgM. [17]
This study represents the most comprehensive evaluation of EIA and LIA IgM testing on
serum from individuals with syphilis that we are aware of. We found that both EIA agreed
substantially, albeit that the Mikrogen EIA performed in terms of diagnostic sensitivity better
than the Euroimmun assay. The difference between both sandwich EIAs lays in the pre-

treatment of serum with the IgG/RF absorbant included in the EIA reagent kit of Euroimmun.
The absorbant removes the antibodies of the IgG classes and the rheumatoid factors, known
to be possible interferences in IgM EIA. False positive reactions may occur in pathogen
specific IgM detection when the IgM rheumatoid factors bind to IgG immune complexes. On
the other hand, false negative results may appear when pathogen specific IgM antibodies
are displaced by stronger binding IgG. [18] We cannot rule out that this extra IgG/RF
removal step may have contributed to the differences in test performance found between
both EIAs.
The general performance of the LIA for the baseline syphilis diagnosis was similar to the
EIAs. The antigen line reaction varied by sample and in some samples only a few antigens
could be demonstrated. Since no particular single antigen or line can be attributed to a stage
or profile, an overall qualitative result should be considered.
In the majority of the IgM positive cases detected at baseline the IgM antibodies
disappeared 6 months after treatment. Interestingly the decline in IgM concentrations
occurred faster in initital syphilis compared to repeat syphilis. Our study hints but remains
inconclusive and additional studies are required to investigate whether IgM concentration
measurements may be a more objective, usefull and high throughput method compared to
RPR for the follow-up of syphilis treatment.
More studies are needed to investigate the role of IgM in syphilis diagnosis on a more
diversified and larger scale (e.g. women, non-MSM populations). Since our study only
included individuals with a dual positive NTT/TT we were unable to evaluate if IgM values
might precede NTT/TT seroconversion. A previous study did find that IgM could be useful in
the early diagnosis of syphilis in the subset of patients with equivocal TT and negative NTTs.
[9]
Strengths of this study include the comprehensive characterization of sera and its
prospective nature. Limitations to this study include the fact that the study population was

mostly HIV infected. We did not control for possible effects of HIV-infection such as viral load
and CD4+ T-cell count, although notably most HIV-infected participants were taking ART and
had a high immune cell count thus the likelihood of this having an effect on the test outcome
is unlikely. The study was not designed to adequately evaluate the assays’ specificity. [19]

Conclusions
In conclusion, the clinical utility of IgM testing for syphilis diagnosis is suboptimal. Low
diagnostic sensitivity, especially in the case of repeat syphilis could lead to missed
infections. However, IgM might have some utility in the follow-up of treatment.
