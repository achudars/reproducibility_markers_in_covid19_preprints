Abstract
Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at
increased risk of complications and death following surgery. Pulmonary complications
are particularly prominent. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a course of physical exercise
and education that helps people with COPD manage their condition. Although proven
to improve health outcomes in patients with stable COPD, it has never been formally
tested as a pre-surgical intervention in patients scheduled for non-cardiothoracic
surgery. If a beneficial effect were to be demonstrated, pulmonary rehabilitation for
pre-surgical patients with COPD might be rapidly implemented across the National
Health Service, as pulmonary rehabilitation courses are already well established
across much of the United Kingdom (UK).
Methods: We performed a feasibility study to test study procedures and barriers to
identification and recruitment to a randomised controlled trial testing whether
pulmonary rehabilitation, delivered before major abdominal surgery in a population of
people with COPD, would reduce the incidence of post-operative pulmonary
complications. This study was run in two UK centres (Oxford and Newcastle upon
Tyne).
Results: We determined that a full randomised controlled trial would not be feasible,
due to failure to identify and recruit participants. We identified an unmet need to
identify more effectively patients with COPD earlier in the surgical pathway. Service
evaluations suggested that barriers to identification and recruitment would likely be the
same across other UK hospitals.
Conclusions: Although pulmonary rehabilitation is a potentially beneficial intervention
to prevent post-operative pulmonary complications, a randomised controlled trial is
unlikely to recruit sufficient participants to answer our study question conclusively at
the present time, when spirometry is not automatically conducted in all patients
planned for surgery. As pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended treatment for all
people with COPD, alternative study methods combined with earlier identification of
candidate patients in the surgical pathway should be considered.

Introduction
In the United Kingdom, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects
approximately 3.7 million people (1), is responsible for approximately 30,000 deaths
per year, and is the fifth most common cause of death (2). COPD is an independent
risk factor for postoperative complications (odds ratio OR 1.35 (CI 1.30-1.40)) and
death (OR 1.29 (CI 1.19-1.39))(3-6). Complications include pulmonary and cardiac
events, sepsis, renal insufficiency and an increased reoperation rate (3). Surgical
patients with COPD thus represent a high-risk group in whom there is an unmet need
to improve post-operative outcomes.

Pulmonary rehabilitation
Pulmonary rehabilitation is “A physical exercise and education programme, tailored for
each person. It includes information on looking after the body and lungs, advice on
managing symptoms, including feeling short of breath, nutrition and psychological
support. People who smoke are given advice on how to stop." (7)

Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually delivered in an outpatient setting, consisting of one
hour of exercise and one hour of education, twice weekly for six weeks. It has profound
benefits on breathlessness, exercise capacity and quality of life (number needed to
treat (NNT)=2) (8), no side effects are reported (9). Pulmonary rehabilitation is
associated with decreased hospital admissions (NNT=3-4), and mortality (NNT =~6)
following COPD exacerbations (10-13). Crucially, pulmonary rehabilitation is
inexpensive (9). Its effect is so powerful that it has a negative cost per quality adjusted
life year (QALY), meaning it saves money for the NHS (14). The main challenges
facing pulmonary rehabilitation are the barriers to its uptake as attendance and
completion of the programme is often poor (15, 16).

Improving post-operative outcomes
Despite adoption in NICE guidelines (17) for stable COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation is
not regularly offered to pre-surgical patients with COPD(18). We believe that
pulmonary rehabilitation merits investigation as a potential means to improve
postoperative outcome in people with COPD undergoing surgery for the following
reasons:
•

A handful of small surgical studies suggest beneficial effects of pulmonary
rehabilitation on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (1923). Differing endpoints, small sample sizes and restriction to specific surgical
groups limits conclusive interpretation.

•

In the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) (24, 25), lung volume
reduction surgery was compared with medical management of COPD. All
patients underwent pre-operative pulmonary rehabilitation. In the thoracic
surgical population of NETT similar outcomes (in terms of functional exercise
capacity and health related quality of life, assessed prior to surgery) were
observed to what would be expected in the treatment of non-surgical patients
with COPD. In fact some participants in NETT decided against lung volume
reduction surgery because they felt so much better after pulmonary
rehabilitation.

•

Shortened durations of pulmonary rehabilitation are efficacious (26, 27). This
is important, because an adapted course may be necessary to fit within surgical
time frames.

•

Pulmonary rehabilitation is widely available and standardised across the NHS
in over 200 UK centres. This has important implications for scalability.

Pre-operative pulmonary rehabilitation needs sufficient time between the decision to
operate and the operation, requires cross specialty working, and involves patients with
two conditions (COPD and a surgical condition). A randomised controlled trial is
therefore justified, as the current evidence base is either not specific to a surgical
population or is case series based and therefore subject to selection bias.
Furthermore, it is unclear whether a randomised controlled trial of pulmonary
rehabilitation before surgery would be practical. This study investigated the feasibility
of running such a large randomised controlled trial. The feasibility study design
matched the expected full study design except in scale.
Methods
This feasibility study was conducted across two research sites (Oxford and Newcastle
upon Tyne), chosen as two areas with different demographics and incidence rates of
COPD. Ethical approval was granted by the South Yorkshire Research Ethics
Committee (approval number 17/YH/0220). Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants prior to the start of the study. The primary aim of the study was to
determine feasibility for a randomised controlled trial and focused on recruitment rate,
barriers to recruitment and uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation.

Study procedures: The main inclusion criteria were
1. Patients scheduled for elective major (body cavity) surgery excluding
cardiothoracic and orthopaedic surgery. In practical terms this meant that
recruitment focused upon patients undergoing surgery for abdominal cancer.
2. A diagnosis of COPD. COPD was defined as post bronchodilator
FEV1/FVC<0.70, FEV1≤ 80% normal. Patients with a physician diagnosis of
COPD were included even if spirometry was not immediately available.

The main exclusion criterion was patients who were unable to participate in pulmonary
rehabilitation according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines (28). Full inclusion
and exclusion criteria can be found in the appendix.

Participant identification and recruitment: To determine the best point in the
surgical pathway to recruit participants, research nurses tested feasibility of screening
for study participants from the following sources.
•

From the surgical multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings

•

In oncology clinics

•

From the electronic patient record for patients scheduled for surgery

•

From hospital anaesthetic preoperative assessment clinics

•

From cardiopulmonary exercise testing clinics

The study aimed to collect 48 full data sets (24 in each centre, 12 pulmonary
rehabilitation, 12 control arm). To achieve this 48 dataset target, based on known dropout rates from pulmonary rehabilitation (18) and potential further data loss due to
surgical scheduling, we anticipated that we would need to recruit 72 patients.

Pulmonary rehabilitation: A pragmatic, exploratory approach was used to explore
what is practically deliverable and tolerated by patients, working closely with local
pulmonary rehabilitation teams in Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne. The aim was for
patients to be enrolled in 3 pulmonary rehabilitation sessions per week, for 3 or 4
weeks, depending on timing of surgery. Pulmonary rehabilitation of this shortened
duration has been shown to be effective(27). Patients were to attend standard NHS
pulmonary rehabilitation groups run for patients with COPD.

Control arm: Patients randomised to the control arm would receive standard care
including advice on smoking cessation, exercise and appropriate referral and
education for those with newly diagnosed COPD.

Research assessments are described in full in the Appendix. Randomisation was
1:1 to either pulmonary rehabilitation or control with self-report questionnaires and
clinical outcome scores collected during the hospital stay and with a 6-week and 6month follow up.

Feasibility measures collected details of barriers to participant identification,
recruitment and retention, the demographics of recruited participants and the feasibility
of delivering pulmonary rehabilitation in the time available.

We assessed study

logistics, performance of research measures, the effectiveness of randomisation. The
full list of feasibility measures is detailed in the appendix.

Outcome measures: We anticipated that the primary research outcome measures for
a future randomised controlled trial would be morbidity, mortality, length of hospital
stay and hospital readmissions so we collected data on this to help with future study
design.

Results
Recruitment commenced in Oxford in January 2018 and in Newcastle upon Tyne in
May 2018. A total of 266 patients were screened of which 65 met the inclusion criteria.
As of January 2019, one participant had been recruited in Oxford and two in Newcastle
upon Tyne. At this point it was determined that running a randomised controlled trial
of pulmonary rehabilitation would not be feasible and the study was terminated.
Further details are presented in Figure 1. We have not presented the research data

here due to interpretability and confidentiality issues arising from only acquiring two
datasets.

We found that the main barrier to study recruitment in both centres was associated
with the way the surgical pathway is organised, especially with regards to two specific
aspects; surgical timelines and identification COPD.

Barriers to identification of study participants

before surgery.

It was challenging to identify patients with COPD at surgical clinics and
multidisciplinary meetings as patients had just received a diagnosis of cancer but a
definitive treatment plan had yet to be instituted. At this point the focus is on the
surgical condition rather than medical conditions such as COPD. Medical records
focused mostly upon surgical condition and respiratory records were often in separate
(unavailable) notes and smoking histories were rarely present. This made screening
laborious and time inefficient.

The definitive decision on whether to operate would only be made following
neoadjuvant treatment. Oncology clinics were assessed as an identification point, but
we found that potential participants attended too many different clinics to find a suitable
point for screening.

Screening the electronic patient record for patients scheduled for surgery did not
successfully identify additional people with COPD. Therefore, COPD was often not
formally diagnosed until the following the anaesthetic preoperative assessment clinic
which usually occurred 2-3 weeks before surgery, with CPET testing taking place a
similar time before surgery.

The difficulty in identifying potential participants with COPD was somewhat
unexpected. As audit data from the pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing
clinics in both Oxford and Newcastle-upon-Tyne suggested that COPD was present in
10 to 15% of the 2,000 to 3,000 patients each year passing through those clinics. This
meant that our pool of potential participants was around 300 in each centre each year.

Vascular surgery clinics were also assessed; these non-cancer patients have a more
clearly defined pre-surgical pathway. However, we found that due to changes in
surgical practices, most patients with respiratory disease were treated endovascularly
and thus recruiting from this clinic was also deemed low yield.

At anaesthetic pre-assessment clinics, the main challenge was that potential
participants with undiagnosed COPD may not have been formally diagnosed after the
pre-assessment clinic (when patients were sent for lung function tests); this made
confirmation of eligibility difficult, and further lessened time for study inclusion.

Barriers to recruitment of study participants
In Newcastle upon Tyne, surgical patients attend the anaesthetic pre-assessment
clinic about one month before surgery, this is in contrast to Oxford where the time
between anaesthetic assessment and surgery is often much shorter. In Newcastleupon-Tyne we were more successful at identifying patients with COPD, but despite
this only two patients were recruited into the study (one of whom subsequently
withdrew).

National survey of preassessment clinics.
We discussed increasing the number of sites for the study with three other potential
UK sites (two teaching hospitals and one large district general hospital) who performed
evaluations of their services, taking into account the preliminary findings of this work.
This would help us evaluate whether the identification and recruitment issues were
generalisable to other centres. However, we found that in all three centres main point
of identifying COPD was found to be at anaesthetic pre-assessment clinics, which
occur two to three weeks prior to operation date (similar to Oxford).

assessment clinics in 110 hospitals in England over the course of 2017 (29). This piece
of work found that the usual time interval between anaesthetic preassessment and
surgery was often only 2-3 weeks, but with wide variability (unpublished observations).
This is equivalent to current practice in Oxford.

Discussion
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a potentially valuable treatment for improving the health
status of people with COPD prior to surgery. We established that a full randomised
controlled trial is not feasible. As a result of this study we have identified an unmet
need in the early identification of COPD in patients presenting for surgery.

Although the study was only run in two UK centres, further scoping work in three
additional centres and a related England-wide survey of anaesthetic services means
that we are reasonably confident that similar challenges in identification and
recruitment would be found if a randomised controlled trial were to run across the UK.
However, on-going developments in the reorganisation of perioperative medicine
services, such as joint surgical and anaesthetic clinics and longer time intervals
between anaesthetic assessment and surgery in the medium term (next 5 years) such
trial may be possible.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is an integral part of the NICE guidelines for the treatment of
COPD, and therefore every person with COPD should be offered this treatment
(alongside the other components of therapy recommended by NICE). This raises the
question about whether a randomised controlled trial is actually the most appropriate
methodology for future work. Barriers to pulmonary rehabilitation are well recognised,
even when implemented a clinical treatment (15, 16). These barriers can be even more
pronounced when tested as an optional research intervention (30). We provided free
transport and offered flexible scheduling for potential participants. These were
recommended by our patient liaison group during the study design phase to help
overcome barriers to taking part in pulmonary rehabilitation, but clearly were
insufficient to enable us to recruit at a sufficient rate.

We therefore speculate that if it we could identify COPD at the beginning of the
patient's surgical journey, patients would be much better placed to have appropriate
management and optimisation of their COPD. Spirometry is cheap, widely available
and reliable and thus perfect for a simple primary care test which should be offered
much more widely and would allow for early optimisation of drug therapy. Pulmonary
rehabilitation could occur in a more timely fashion as this intervention could be
integrated and planned alongside chemo- and radio- therapy, rather than in the weeks
immediately preceding surgery. Patients with COPD would benefit even if they do not
eventually proceed to surgery, with potential cost savings for the NHS(34, 35).
Potential solutions to this are illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2. A summary of the challenges to identification (and thus treatment) of COPD for surgical patients
and potential solutions

This study has demonstrated the considerable challenge in performing additional
interventions in the immediate period before surgery. However, the duration of the
patient’s journey from referral to surgery can take several months and remains an ideal
period to optimise COPD if appropriate patients are identified earlier in the process.
Some UK hospitals have recently implemented initiatives to ‘re-design’ this surgical
pathway, which may help overcome this barrier (36). The importance of identifying and
engaging with patients early after the “moment of contemplation” of surgery is clearly
a critical success factor for interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation; which are
known (from other contexts) to require a defined period of time to implement and
provide benefit. However, we should take caution from evidence from studies in lung
cancer which show that the time of diagnosis is a difficult time to consider pulmonary
rehabilitation (31).

Although there may be an opportunity to provide pulmonary

rehabilitation whilst neo-adjuvant therapy is being provided patients often do not want

to engage with pulmonary rehabilitation at a time when they are dealing with a new,
life changing diagnosis and having burdensome, potentially toxic cancer treatment
(31). Thus it might turn out that pulmonary rehabilitation can only really feasibly
delivered once cancer treatment has finished. There is emerging evidence that
exercise therapies enhance cancer survival (32, 33) and that a recommendation from
the oncologist may be influential in the view patients might take.

Pulmonary rehabilitation represents an important part of the NICE guidelines for the
treatment of COPD and is readily available in the NHS. We know that patients will
benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation, even if it is consequently shown not to have a
specific

effect

upon

postoperative

pulmonary

complications.

Patients

who

consequently do not require surgery will still benefit. We have shown that a randomised
controlled trial is not feasible, so we need to approach this in a different way using
alternate methodologies.

Appendix

Patient involvement in study design: As we anticipated that recruitment to this study
may be challenging, we discussed the study design with patient groups consisting of
people with COPD who had either undergone surgery, or those who had experienced
pulmonary rehabilitation. The key messages from these patient representatives were
to ensure that transport to and from pulmonary rehabilitation would be provided, and
that a flexible approach to scheduling would be necessary so pulmonary rehabilitation
could fit with other appointments.

Inclusion Criteria:
•

Adult patients aged 18 years or older with COPD

•

Has capacity to take part in this study

•

Scheduled for elective major (body cavity) surgery OR laparascopic surgery

•

anticipated to last longer than 2 hours

•

People with more than 20 pack years smoking history were approached to take
part in the study if spirometry subsequently confirmed COPD.

Exclusion Criteria
•

Inability to give informed consent

•

Insufficient command of English to understand the study documentation

•

Unable to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation treatment according to British

•

Thoracic Society guidelines.

•

Patients scheduled cardiac, thoracic and orthopaedic surgery and orthopaedic
surgery

Feasibility measures collected throughout the study:
Key feasibility measures:
•

Can we recruit at a sufficient rate to run an RCT?

•

What is severity (GOLD/MRC) of the recruited patients and how does this
compare with the screened patients

•

Whether it is feasible to deliver the pulmonary rehabilitation intervention in the
time available. This will include assess the impact of changing surgical dates,
e.g. earlier (so insufficient rehabilitation delivered), later (so effect of
rehabilitation wearing off).

•

Number of complete data sets collected

•

Scheduling of pulmonary rehabilitation sessions within the surgical waiting time

•

Effectiveness of transport to/from pulmonary rehabilitation. Although we plan
to contribute transport costs for the study there needs to be consideration for
when pulmonary rehabilitation is offered as a treatment.

•

Factors relating to scheduling, including effect of changes in operation date.

•

Feasibility of tracking patients postoperatively-either in person and/or via
electronic and paper based patient records

•

Is the drop-out rate from study similar in both groups?

•

Does the randomisation system work?

Health economics. We know there is health economic benefit for pulmonary
rehabilitation in the treatment of COPD - does this translate to a surgical population?
•

EQ-5D-5L measured at baseline, at day 5, 6 weeks and 6 months post
operatively

•

Resource use will be measured, including primary care, pulmonary
rehabilitation, hospital services(e.g. before during and after surgery)

Plans to mitigate against bias / Outcome integrity:
•

Assessors will be blinded to treatment group.

•

We will trial ways to ensure that the outcomes chosen are as fair as possible
and are collected in a way that avoids bias. This will include objective criteria
scoring by blinded individuals.

Research assessments:
Recruited participants were randomised 1:1 to either pulmonary rehabilitation or
treatment as normal, minimised for study site and Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage, using an online randomisation service
(Sealed Envelope Limited, London, UK).

Participants were assessed prior to

pulmonary rehabilitation or control treatment (preoperative assessment) and following
surgery during hospital inpatient stay on postoperative days 3, 5, and 8 and again at a
6-week and 6-month follow-up. The data collected at each time point can be found in
the appendix. Other than a 6-minute walk test, the research data consisted of selfreport questionnaires on mood, symptoms, and quality of life. Data obtained from the
NHS clinical record included various perioperative risk scores, co-morbidity scores,
and measures relating to the operation and outcomes.

Pulmonary rehabilitation
This section gives further information on the composition of standard course of
pulmonary rehabilitation that is used for the treatment of COPD in the non-surgical
setting. The courses are preceeded by an assessment session to check suitability for
pulmonary rehabilitation and collect baseline clinical measures (based around
functional exercise capacity, quality of life and symptom measures, and spirometry).
The final session repeats these assessments.

The courses usually consist of two hour sessions performed twice weekly for six
weeks. These consist one hour exercise and one hour education. The exercise
sessions include both aerobic and strengthening exercises and are tailored to the
individual's ability and there may be variation between courses.

Aerobic exercises may include:
•

Step-ups

•

Walking on the spot

•

Treadmill walking

•

Exercise bicycle

Strengthening exercises (3 sets of 10) include:
•

Sit-to-stand

•

Biceps curls

•

Upright row

•

Leg extensions
