ABSTRACT

Background
With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting
monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the
current monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention
programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued.

Methods
To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission
model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating
the model to seven years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We
determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive
suite of intervention programmes.

Findings
Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 2-14% of
infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively
and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with longacting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around
£4,350 but dropping to £200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or £90 for all infants. A
seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than £85 to be cost-effective and
affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective
relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable.
Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if
priced less than £80.

Interpretations
In a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology, maternal protection conferred to newborns is also
seasonal, an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV. For a
country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England, seasonal programmes rather than yearround intervention programmes are always optimal.

Introduction

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory
infection in children under five years of age globally, causing 48,000-74,500 deaths annually.1
The sole pharmaceutical prevention strategy, a monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab), is costly
and only available to infants in high-income countries and only to those at most risk of RSVrelated complications.2 This gap in prevention strategies leaves the majority of infants
vulnerable to infection.
There are currently over 40 RSV prophylactic candidates in pre-clinical or clinical trials,3 those
furthest along in development include long-acting monoclonal antibodies (e.g. MEDI8897 by
MedImmune),4 and maternal, childhood, and elderly vaccines (e.g. RSV F-nanoparticle vaccine
by

Novavax,

respectively).

Although missing its primary endpoint, a recent Stage III trial of the Novavax

RSV F-nanoparticle vaccine showed promising results, preventing RSV-related lower
respiratory tract infections and hospitalisations in babies born to vaccinated mothers in the
South Africa site.5 While, Stage II trial results suggest that the MedImmune MEDI8897 longacting monoclonal antibodies are effective at preventing RSV-disease in neonates for at least
150 days post-administration—five times longer than a single dose of Palivizumab.4 Stage II trial
results for the adenovirus vectored vaccines GlaxoSmithKline ChAd155-RSV and Jensen
Ad26.RSV.preF suggest that they are well tolerated and safe in their respective target groups of
infants and the elderly respectively, though we currently lack efficacy results.6

Deciding which, if any, of this suite of pharmaceutical prophylactics to adopt requires an
integrated approach in which all the health benefits accrued by targeted specific subpopulations
(intervention strategies)—both by direct and indirect protection and across all ages—can be
accurately compared. Moreover, with multiple new prophylactics likely to arrive to license at a
similar time, understanding the relative efficiency of potential intervention strategies at
controlling RSV burden, and therefore what we should be willing to pay for them, will dominate
decision-making on future RSV intervention strategies.

In this study we developed such an integrated approach by combining a novel age-stratified
epidemiological transmission model for RSV into a cost-effectiveness framework. The model
was calibrated using a Bayesian inference framework to seven years of RSV incidence data

Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) reference case.7 Using this approach, we were able to
determine the maximum purchasing prices for the next generation of RSV intervention
strategies to be cost-effective and affordable.

METHODS

RSV model structure

We modelled the number of individuals in six different epidemiological states (M, S, E, I, A and
R). When a susceptible individual (S) acquires infection, they move to an exposed but not
infectious state (E) for an average of 1/σ days, after which they become infectious with either
symptomatic (I) or asymptomatic (A) infection. After an infectious period of 1/γ days, individuals
move to a protected state (R) for a period of 1/ω days, after which they become susceptible to
reinfection (S). We assume that only babies born to mothers who have recently been infected
with RSV and who therefore have high levels of antibody (and thus, in state R) are maternally
protected (M) for a period of 1/ξ after birth, with the remaining babies born susceptible to
infection (S) (Supplementary Information 1 Figure S1). We tested this assumption to the
alternative where all babies are born with temporary maternal immunity, similar to previous
models (e.g. Kinyanjui et al.8) using the deviance information criterion (DIC) (Supplementary
Information 1 Section 1.1, Figure S2). We stratified individuals into 25 age groups (monthly up
to 11 months of age, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–
74, 75+ years) and also tracked the number of individuals had experienced zero, one, and two
or more previous infections (denoted by the subscripts 0, 1, 2, 3). Consistent with empirical
data, we assume that the proportion of individuals who experienced asymptomatic infection is
dependent on age9 and the duration of infection and susceptibility to infection are dependent on
the number of previous RSV infections.10,11 We assume that the contact rate between two age
groups is proportional to the mean number of daily physical and conversational contacts made
between those age groups—parameterised using empirical data from England and Wales
(Supplementary Information 1 Section 1.2).12,13 We captured the strongly seasonal dynamics
of RSV in temperate climates by multiplying the per-contact transmission rate with a seasonal
forcing term (Supplementary Information 1 Section 1.3).

To capture the current impact of administering Palivizumab, we tracked very high risk (VHR)
infants aged between 0-8 months who are eligible for a course of Palivizumab during the RSV
season, that is those born premature with Chronic Lung Disease or Congenital Heart Disease
during the months of October to February, the RSV season).2 For these VHR infants, we
assumed that 90% receive Palivizumab with 33.8% acquiring immediate protection which lasts

Model parameterisation and calibration
We used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach15 to fit the model to the
confirmed number of positive weekly RSV samples in England collected via the Respiratory
DataMart System (RDMS) between July 2010 and June 2017.16 We used a binomial likelihood
function that assumes an age-specific reporting rate of RSV positive samples. To estimate how
the reporting rates of RSV infection varied across ages, we tested five different assumptions
about the age stratification (number and age grouping) using the Deviance Information Criterion
(DIC) (Supplementary Information 1 Section 3, Figure S5, Table S4). We constructed the
prior distributions for all epidemiological parameters after a comprehensive synthesis of the
literature (Supplementary Information 1 Section 2, Figures S4 and Tables S3).9–11,17–26 The
output of the calibration is a joint posterior distribution for all the fitted parameters of the
transmission model. To compare our model to the weekly number of RSV positive samples we
multiplied the model-predicted weekly incidence of symptomatic cases with the fitted agespecific reporting rates.

Intervention model structure

Status quo: We assume that Palivizumab is currently administered to 90% of VHR infants at
birth between October to February inclusive (PAL-VHR-S, Supplementary Information 1
Section 4 Figure S6). We compare this status quo to the following three alternative intervention
strategies.

Long-acting monoclonal antibodies: We tracked the number of infants protected by long-acting
monoclonal antibodies, VM, who remain protected after birth for an average of 1/ωmab = 250 days
after which they return to S0 (Supplementary Information 1 Section 4 Figure S7). However,
we relaxed this assumption in an uncertainty analysis. We evaluated three seasonal
programmes that administer a single dose of long-acting monoclonal antibodies at birth i) to
those who are currently eligible for Palivizumab (MAB-VHR-S), ii) to both VHR infants and
infants who are at heightened risk (HR) of developing complications due to respiratory disease
(MAB-HR-S), iii) to all infants regardless of risk (MAB-ALL-S). We evaluated two additional

seasonal programmes that extend administration (iv) to all VHR and high-risk (HR) infants under
six months (MAB-HR-S+) and v) to all infants under six months (MAB-ALL-S+) throughout
October only.6 We assume that these programmes would replace the existing Palivizumab
programme; that they all achieve the same coverage as Palivizumab and that the efficacy per
course is 70.1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 52.3–81.0%).4,27

Childhood/elderly vaccination: We assumed that a single dose of a vaccine conferred the same
protection as that of a natural infection, such that 83.0% (95% CI 75.0–88.0%) of vaccinated
individuals in the ith previous infection group who are susceptible (Si) are moved to respective
recovered group (Ri) after a delay reflect the build up of antibody immunity (Supplementary
Information 1 Section 4 Figure S8).28 We considered two vaccination programmes aimed at
infants aged 2 months old; one administered seasonally (VAC-INF-S) and one year-round
(VAC-INF-A),

considered two seasonal vaccination programmes aimed at elderly persons: one for those aged
75 years and older (VAC-75-S) and one for those aged 65 years and older (VAC-65-S), both
achieving a coverage of 70%, consistent with vaccination coverage for the elderly influenza
vaccine programme.29,30 Finally, we considered three seasonal programmes aimed at preschool
children (aged 2–4 years, VAC-2-4-S) and school-age children (aged 5--9 years, VAC-5-9-S,
and aged 5–14 years, VAC-5-14-S), that achieve a coverage of 45% and 60% respectively,
consistent with the live attenuated influenza vaccination programme in England.29 We assumed
that all these vaccine programmes would be administered in addition to the existing Palivizumab
programme in the UK.

Maternal vaccination: To evaluate the direct effect on infants of vaccinating pregnant women,
we used the results of Novavax’s maternal vaccine Stage III trial that found 41.4% (95% CI 4.1–
64.2) of infants born to these mothers are protected against infection for the first 3 months of life
(Table 2).5 Consistent with the trial, we assume pregnant women are vaccinated at any point
between 28 and 32 weeks gestation (Supplementary Information 1 Section 4 Figure S9).

To evaluate the indirect effects of maternal vaccination while maintaining computational
tractability and epidemiological realism, we used a previously published method for evaluating
the impact of parental vaccination.31 In brief, this method tracks the number of mothers of
infants less than one year of age, and the number of these women who are participating in a

maternal vaccination programme. The contact rate between mothers and their children is
explicitly modelled using the number of household and non-household contacts, as reported by
the Great Britain arm of the POLYMOD study.12,13 Accordingly, the force of infection between
mothers and their infants is updated to reflect the vaccination status of the mother. We assume
that the vaccinated mothers are themselves temporarily protected from infection consistent with

assumptions

above

(Supplementary Information 1 Section 4 Figure S9). We considered two maternal
vaccination programmes, which are given in combination with the existing Palivizumab
programme: a seasonal programme (MAT-S), and one administered year-round, (MAT-A) with a
coverage of 60% as observed for prepartum Tdap vaccination in England.5,29

Optimising seasonal administration: To allow an unbiased comparison of the seasonal
programmes, our framework assumes the programmes are given continuously for five months.
For programmes that administer Palivizumab and long-acting monoclonal antibodies, we
assume administration occurs during the Palivizumab-recommended time period of October to
February. To determine the period of administration for the remaining intervention programmes,
we chose the five-month period that resulted in the largest QALY gain relative to status quo.

Economic model

Clinical outcomes: For each intervention strategy, the economic model estimated the number of
cases averted for five different RSV-associated clinical outcomes: symptomatic infection, GP
consultations, hospital admissions, hospital bed days and deaths. The number of symptomatic
cases averted is estimated directly from the transmission model. To estimate the number of
cases averted for the remaining four outcomes, we first calculated the per-infection probability
that an individual experiences each clinical outcome by dividing the reported annual incidence
rates for each outcome taken from previous burden studies in England32–38 (Supplementary
Information 1 Section 5.1, Figure S10) by the transmission-model-estimated annual incidence
for RSV under the status quo. Then, to calculate the number of cases averted for each outcome
under each intervention strategy, we multiplied the estimated number of RSV-cases averted
from the intervention model by the per-infection probability of each outcome.

Quality of life loss: In line with our previously estimated quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss
estimates per RSV episode for England, we assume that each GP consultation or

hospitalisation resulted in a QALY loss of 4.098 × 10-3 (0.624 × 10-3–13.141 × 10-3) and 2.990 ×
10-3 (0.346 × 10-3–11.387 × 10-3) for under fives and over fives respectively, while other
symptomatic non-healthcare seeking infections resulted in a QALY loss of 2.336 × 10-3 (95% CI
0.269 × 10-3–9.255 × 10-3) and 1.448 × 10-3 (95% CI 0.135 × 10-3–5.928 × 10-3).39 QALY loss due
to death was commensurate with the remaining number of expected healthy years of life
remaining in the individual (Supplementary Information 1 Section 5.2).

Costs: Costs were calculated in 2018 GBP, from the perspective of the NHS. The cost per GP
consultation was calculated by assuming an average GP consultation time of 9 minutes at a
cost of £4.00 a minute (£36.00).40,41 The cost per hospital bed day for children less than five
years of age was calculated using the non-elective costs for paediatric Bronchitis (Health
Resource group (HRG) PD15A–D)—the main cause of RSV-associated hospitalisations.42,43
The cost per hospital bed day for children five years and older was determined using the nonelective costs for unspecified Acute Lower Respiratory Infection (HRG DZ22K–Q).43 We
assumed maternal, infant and elderly vaccines take 15 minutes to administer in a GP clinic at a
cost of £9 per course (assuming one dose per course).41 Similarly, we assumed long-acting
monoclonal antibodies and Palivizumab, take 15 minutes to administer in hospital by a nurse at
a cost of £11.50 per course for long-acting monoclonal antibodies and £57.50 per course (5
doses) for Palivizumab.41 A course of Palivizumab costs £4035 (5 doses at £807 each).43

Cost-effectiveness analysis: We conducted three separate cost-effectiveness analyses. First,
we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of replacing the Palivizumab with
any of the long-acting monoclonal programmes (MAB-VHR-S, MAB-HR-S, MAB-HR-S+, MABALL-S, and MAB-ALL-S+). Second, we calculated the ICERs of supplementing the Palvizumab
programme with the childhood or elderly vaccine programmes (VAC-INF-S, VAC-INF-A, VAC2-4-S, VAC-5-9-S, VAC-5-14-S, VAC-75-S, VAC-65-S). Third, we calculated the ICER of
supplementing the Palivizumab programme with the maternal vaccine programmes (MAT-S,
MAT-A). For each of these three cost-effective analyses, using the non-dominated programmes
only, we calculated the maximum price per course that would make each strategy cost-effective,
assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY (Supplementary Information 1
Section 5.3). All costs and effects were discounted at a rate of 3.5% over a 10-year time
horizon.7

For each intervention strategy, we calculated the credibility intervals using 1,000

Monte Carlo samples. For each Monte Carlo sample, we first estimated the number of RSV
cases averted over the time horizon per outcome for an intervention strategy by sampling from

the joint posterior distribution and running the intervention model for 10 years. Then, by
sampling from the per-infection probability of each outcome occurring, we converted the number
of RSV cases averted to the number of outcomes averted. Finally, we combined sampled
values from the cost distributions with the number of each clinical outcome averted to calculate
the distribution of the maximum price per prophylactic course.

Affordability: An intervention strategy is considered affordable if it costs less than £20 million
annually during the first three years of implementation.44 Using this definition, we calculated the
affordable purchasing price per course for each non-dominated programme, by subtracting the
total, undiscounted cost of administering the intervention strategy for the first three years from
£60 million (3 years at £20 million each) and dividing by the total number of courses given
during this period.44

RESULTS

RSV Epidemiology

Our model comparison analyses suggested that maternal immunity was conferred seasonality
according to the prevalence of recently infected pregnant mothers (Supplementary
Information 2 Figure S1). Furthermore, we found that there is a likely exponential decrease in
the reporting rates between the ages of 0-5 years, and fixed reporting rates for 5-55 years and
55 years and over (Supplementary Information 2 Figure S2).

The model reproduces the age distribution of RSV incidence (Figure 1a-c, Supplementary
Information 2 Figure 3–4). Using the calibration method, we are able to estimate parameters
that have been difficult to evaluate directly from epidemiological studies (Supplementary
Information 2 Figure 5). First, our model predicts that between 68-81% of infants experience
an RSV infection in their first year of life, with subsequent infection risk generally decreasing
with age (Figure 1d). Deviations away from this decreasing trend occur in age groups which
have the highest number of daily contacts (Figure 1d). Second, we estimated the average
duration of maternal immunity and post-infection immunity as 134 days (95% CrI 120–146) and
359 days (95% CI 351–365), respectively. Third, the model estimated that asymptomatic
infections are 63% (95% CrI 54%–72%) as infectious as symptomatic infections (Table 1), and
finally, we found that 14% of babies are born with protection to RSV during March, compared
with 2% prior to the RSV season in September and October (Supplementary Information 2
Figure 2).

Probability of clinical outcomes

The average probability of consulting a GP due to RSV infection is highest in children less than
5 years of age (0.006–0.065) and adults 65 years and older (0.103–0.132). The average
probability of death per-infection is highest in adults over 75 years (0.002) and rare in children
and other adults in the remaining age groups (less than 3 in every 100,000 infections). The
average probability of hospitalisation is highest in infants below 1 year of age (0.010–0.097),
with peak risk occurring at 1 month of age, and lowest risk in persons aged 5-45 years of age
(less than one in every 10,000 infections). HR and VHR infants have an increased risk of

hospitalisation of 0.0138–0.129 and 0.14–0.37 respectively, compared with other infants
(0.010–0.097). Similarly, the average number of bed days experienced per hospitalisation is
greatest in infants less than 1 year of age (1–5) with the longest stays occurring at 1 month of
age, and HR and VHR infants seeing an increase in the number of bed days of 5–7 and 8–25
respectively. (Supplementary Information 2 Figure 6).

Impact of intervention strategies

Long-acting monoclonal antibodies: The seasonal programmes aimed at VHR infants or VHR
and HR infants (MAB-VHR-S and MAB-HR-S, respectively) are the most efficient at preventing
RSV hospitalisations, preventing 51 (95%CI 43–55) and 36 (95% CI 30–39) hospital cases per
1,000 administered courses. These intervention programmes are not effective in raising the
median age of primary infection. (Figure 2b).

Childhood/elderly vaccination: We found that to maximise the health benefit of the seasonal
vaccination programmes, the optimal period of administration is between November and March
for elderly programmes, October to February for the VAC-2-4-S and VAC-5-9-S programmes,
and August to December for the VAC-5-14-S programme. (Supplementary Information 2
Figure 7). Vaccinating individuals 65 years and over is the most effective programme at
preventing the total number of GP consultations, hospitals, bed days and deaths (23%, 25%,
26% and 49% reductions respectively) (Figure 2a). However, the large size of the target group
means this programme is inefficient, preventing 19.03, 1.63, 4.34, and 0.25 cases of GP
consultations, hospitals, bed days and deaths respectively per 1,000 vaccine courses. The most
effective school-age programme is the 5–14 year old programme, preventing 4.5% (95% CrI
3.9–5.4) of hospitalised cases. School-age programmes confer considerable herd protection,
with 91.5% of the 5-9 year old programme and 94.9% of 5-14 year old programme of averted
hospitalised cases due to indirect protection (Figure 2c, Supplementary Information 2 Figure
8).

Maternal vaccination: Our results suggest that, to maximise the health benefit for a seasonal
third trimester maternal programme, the optimal period of administration is from August until
December (Supplementary Information 2 Figure 7). Such a programme prevents 8.5 (95%
CrI 7.4–10.3) hospitalised cases per 1,000 vaccine courses administered, with 22-30% of the
hospitalised cases prevented in infants less than 1 year of age attributable to indirect protection

from vaccinated mothers (Figure 2d). Though the seasonal maternal programme is more
efficient than its year-round counterpart, it is less efficient at preventing hospitalised cases than
any of the long-acting monoclonal antibodies programmes.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention strategies

Long-acting monoclonal antibodies: The maximum purchasing price per course for the longacting monoclonal antibodies programme to be cost-effective when administered seasonally to
only the VHR infants is £4,342.97 (95% CrI £4,126.31–4,462.25) (Figure 3). For this seasonal
programme to remain cost-effective after extending to HR neonates (MAB-HR-S), and then to
all HR infants less than 6 months at the start of season (MAB-HR-S+), requires substantially
lower maximum purchasing prices per course of £201.15 (95% CrI £149.61–243.42) and £87.03
(95% CrI £64.80–116.99) respectively (Figure 3a). If the duration of protection varies between
150 and 365 days, the maximum purchasing price for the MAT-HR-S programme would also
vary between £185.79-215.02, respectively (Figure 3b).

Maternal vaccination: The year-round maternal vaccination programme was dominated by the
seasonal strategy. The maximum purchasing price per course for the seasonal maternal
vaccination to be cost-effective is £85.27 (95% CrI £77.79–93.80) (Figure 3a).

Childhood/elderly vaccination: The year-round vaccine programme aimed at infants 2 months of
age is dominated by its seasonal counterpart, while the 65 years and over programme is
dominated by the 75 years and older programme. Further, the pre-school, and school-age
programmes are subject to extended dominance by the 75 years and older programme. For the
seasonal vaccine programme aimed at infants aged 2 months of age, the maximum purchasing
price per course to remain cost-effective is £94.76 (95%CrI 89.09–99.24). Targeting those aged
75 years and older requires a lower purchasing price per course of £20.71 (95% CrI 10.32–
34.64) (Figure 3a).

Affordability: The long-acting monoclonal antibodies programmes: MAB-VHR-S, MAB-HR-S,
and MAB-HR-S+ and the seasonal maternal programme (MAT-S) are affordable if implemented
for a cost-effective purchasing price per course (affordable thresholds are £9,395.75, £1,712.46,
£873.08, and £121.02 respectively). The seasonal infant programme aimed at 2-month-olds and

DISCUSSION

This study used a mathematical modelling approach calibrated to seven years of RSV incidence
data to evaluate RSV epidemiology and surveillance in a developed country. Integrating this
model into a cost-effectiveness framework, we evaluated the likely maximum dose prices of the
new generation of RSV preventive pharmaceuticals to make them cost-effective and affordable
in England. Our epidemiologic analysis found that maternal protection for infants is likely
seasonal, with more babies born with protection against RSV towards the end of the RSV
season in March. Our economic analysis found that replacing the existing seasonally
administered Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies would be costeffective and affordable at a maximum course price of £4403 (95% CrI 4338–4511). Extending
the programme to heightened risk or all infants would remain cost-effective and affordable at
approximately £200 and £90, respectively. A seasonal maternal vaccination programme would
be cost-effective and affordable with a maximum purchasing price per course of £85 (95% CrI
79–91).

This is the first study to use a dynamic transmission model to evaluate how Palivizumab,
monoclonal antibodies, and maternal vaccines impact the incidence of RSV-related healthcare
outcomes within a single framework. Consequently, this model gives a comprehensive overview
of the impact of all currently proposed RSV programmes. This study is also the first to directly
link the impact of potential programmes from a dynamic transmission model to a costeffectiveness analysis (CEA) according to the NICE reference case—the gold standard
approach for CEA in England and Wales, and the first to use EQ-5D-based QALY estimates for
RSV. The CEA accounts for both the direct and indirect effects of intervention strategies. This
approach is of particular importance when comparing the health benefits of vaccinating schoolage children through which all reductions in hospitalisations are through indirect protection of
other high-risk groups, with those of providing direct protection to newborns where all averted
cases are in the newborns themselves.

Our model is the first to test the hypothesis that maternal protection to newborns is seasonal,
contrary to the routine assumption in models in which all babies are born with protection to RSV.
We found evidence for our alternative hypothesis. This seasonal change in the number of
protected new-borns could provide an explanation for previous findings that hospitalisation rates
increase for babies born at the start of the RSV season, when our model predicts the lowest

fraction of maternally-protected infants, and infants born at the end of the RSV season when the
maternal protection is highest experience the lowest risk of RSV-related hospitalisation.46
Epidemiological evidence for seasonal changes in maternal protection has also been provided
in studies looking at seasonal changes in RSV-specific antibody level from cord titres at birth.17
As cord titre influences the rate of severe infections in the first year of life,24 seasonal changes
could indicate temporal vulnerability in the infant population.

The maternal vaccine in this model is based on Novavax ‘s RSV F-nanoparticle formulation.
Recent stage III trial results for this product failed to meet its primary end point of 40% efficacy
against RSV lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) during the first three months of life across
all trial sites. However, variations in efficacy were observed depending on region and gestation
age at administration. Regional variation in efficacy saw South Africa with promising efficacy
estimates of 57% (95% CI 33%–73%) against RSV LRTI, whereas the US site saw no evidence
of efficacy.5 Although in this analysis, we assume the efficacy of the maternal vaccine is as
estimated across all sites, we acknowledge that care should be taken when these results are
projected onto the UK, which experiences seasonal RSV similar to the US trial site. Efficacy was
also found to vary with gestational age at administration, with vaccination at the start of the third
trimester (28-32 weeks) experiencing an efficacy of 54% (95% CI 23%–72%) against RSVassociated hospitalisation and showing superior antibody transfer when compared to
administration later in the third trimester (efficacy of 26% (95% CI -23–56). In our study we have
chosen the efficacy given at 28-32 weeks gestation as the health care delivery system in
England is such that specific uptake periods are feasible in GP clinics if individuals are notified
at the relevant time. However, uptake during this specific window may be less feasible in
countries with differing healthcare policy and thus lower coverage rates may be observed than
used in this study.

Though the results of this analysis suggest that the long-acting monoclonal antibodies and
maternal programmes are cost-effective, implementation of these programmes will present
clinical and logistical challenges that this analysis has not considered. For example, we assume
the same administration price per dose for all the monoclonal antibody programmes. However
administration of monoclonal antibodies to the under 6 months, rather than just newborns, will
likely be more expensive and achieve lower rates of uptakes, all else equal, as they will need to
make a separate appointment at a GP or hospital setting for dose administration. Consequently
our results may overestimate the impact and cost-effectiveness of these programmes. Further,

in estimating the per-infection risk for RSV-related outcomes, there were no clinical-risk-specific
estimates for death and for GP consultations available in the literature, meaning the probability
of these outcomes occurring may be underestimated in VHR or HR infants, implying costs and
QALY burden of some of the intervention strategies may be conservative. Further studies which
help estimate the burden of specific outcomes in England would help reduce uncertainty and
increase the accuracy of the model predictions.

In this study, we have used a Bayesian approach to synthesise existing epidemiological and
clinical information to estimate the uncertainty in the model parameters and to incorporate
uncertainty arising from these parameter estimates to help inform decision-makers about the
implementation of new RSV intervention strategies. Our analysis finds that, regardless of the
intervention strategy, seasonal administration of a programme is always optimal. Moreover, we
found little evidence that strategies aimed at children 2 years and older and those targeted at
the elderly would be cost-effective or affordable, respectively. In contrast, long-acting
monoclonal antibodies and maternal vaccines may be a cost-effective replacement or addition
to the existing Palivizumab programme, respectively. The scope of the intervention programme
however will depend on the purchasing price at when these pharmaceuticals are made
available.
