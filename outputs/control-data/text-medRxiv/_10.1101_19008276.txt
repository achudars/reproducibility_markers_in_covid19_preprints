Abstract
Hyperosmolar solutions are widely used to treat raised intracranial pressure (ICP) following severe traumatic
brain injury (TBI). Although mannitol has historically been the most frequently administered, hypertonic
saline (HTS) solutions are increasingly being used. However, definitive evidence regarding their comparative
effectiveness is lacking. The Sugar or Salt (SOS) Trial is a UK randomised, allocation concealed open label
multicentre pragmatic trial designed to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of hypertonic saline
(HTS) compared with mannitol in the management of patients with severe TBI. Patients requiring intensive
care unit admission and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring post-TBI will be allocated at random to receive
equi-osmolar boluses of either mannitol or HTS following failure of routine first line measures to control ICP.
The primary outcome for the study will be the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) assessed at 6
months after randomisation. Results will inform current clinical practice in the routine use of hyperosmolar
therapy as well as assess the impact of potential side effects. Pre-planned longer term clinical and cost
effectiveness analyses will further inform the use of these treatments.

Background
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and severe disability with sixty-nine million individuals
worldwide estimated to sustain a TBI each year.1 In the United Kingdom, approximately 3,500 patients have
moderate to severe TBI requiring treatment in intensive care units (ICUs) each year.2 Resource use in these
patients is high with an average length of stay in ICU of 9 days.2 Long term outcomes from TBI remain poor –
with reported mortality as high as 26% at 6 months and significant disability in survivors.3
Following TBI, intracranial pressure (ICP) may be increased by a mass effect from intracranial haematomas,
contusions, diffuse brain swelling, or hydrocephalus. A number of studies have shown an association
between raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and poor neurological outcomes.4,5 As a result, the treatment of
elevated ICP has been a central focus of both the medical and surgical management of patients with severe
TBI on the ICU.
The intensive care management of patients with severe TBI and raised ICP usually takes a stepwise approach.
Patients receive “stage 1” interventions (sedation, artificial ventilation, blood pressure and temperature
control, and head-up positioning) as part of routine ICU care. If these measures fail to limit ICP to
approximately 20-25mmHg, medical management with either the drug mannitol (a sugar alcohol) or
hypertonic saline (HTS) is used alongside other “stage 2” measures. If these drugs (osmotherapy) fail to
control ICP, “stage 3” measures include surgical decompression and barbiturate-induced coma.
Both mannitol and HTS are thought to have a similar core mechanism of action. They both increase the
osmotic pressure of plasma in a dose-dependent fashion. The increased plasma osmotic pressure draws
water from extracellular spaces in brain tissue, decreasing the volume of both oedematous and normal brain
tissue and thereby decreasing ICP. The increased plasma osmolality also draws water into the circulation
from all tissue extracellular spaces and so increases circulating volume, cardiac output and possibly blood
pressure, whilst decreasing blood viscosity by haemodilution. These effects all increase cerebral blood flow
and oxygen delivery. Mannitol also causes an osmotic diuresis with increased free water clearance and a
further secondary increase in plasma osmolarity.
While mannitol has been the traditional hyperosmolar agent of choice, use of HTS is increasing. This has been
supported by several recent small but heterogeneous, studies.6-8 A number of systematic reviews have also
been published recently reviewing trials investigating the use of osmotherapy in TBI.9-11 The included trials
were limited by moderate to high risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision and indirectness, and spanned three
decades during which management of traumatic brain injury evolved. Although reduction in ICP has been
consistently demonstrated with both mannitol and HTS, there is a suggestion that HTS provides a more
robust and durable effect in lowering ICP.6,7

To provide a definitive answer to whether mannitol or HTS is the better agent for osmotherapy, the National
Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has commissioned the “Sugar or Salt” (SOS) trial (HTA reference
17/120/01). This is a UK randomised, multi-centre, allocation concealed, open label trial designed to assess
the relative effects of mannitol or HTS on long-term neurological outcome when used to treat raised
intracranial pressure in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). This paper provides a summary of the trial
protocol.

Study objectives
Primary objective
The primary objective of the SOS Trial is to determine whether hyperosmolar therapy regimes involving
hypertonic saline or mannitol improve neurological function at 6 months (as assessed by the GOS-E
questionnaire) following severe TBI with raised ICP.

Secondary objectives
Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of hyperosmolar therapy with either hypertonic saline or
mannitol on clinical, patient-centred and economic outcomes in the ICU, in hospital and up to 12 months
follow-up post randomisation. These will address all the outcomes identified in the HTA commissioning brief
and provide a definitive assessment of the clinical and cost effectiveness of hyperosmolar treatments.

Methods and design
This protocol manuscript was written in concordance with the SPIRIT guidelines.12

Trial design
The SOS trial is an allocation concealed, open label, randomised controlled clinical and cost effectiveness trial
with an internal pilot and blinded assessment of primary outcome at 6 months. The main trial will be
preceded by a six-month internal pilot study in 8-10 ICUs to test recruitment feasibility and compliance with
assigned treatment. The progression of the pilot will be informed by the recently published best practice
guidelines.13 The trial will be conducted and managed by the Warwick Clinical Trials Unit (WCTU) and
sponsored by the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust.
The funding is provided by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) following a commissioned call
from the Health Technology Assessment programme (HTA study reference 17/120/01). The trial will be
conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

Participants, interventions and outcomes
Study setting
The main trial will take place in at least 25 UK NHS hospitals with ICUs that routinely manage patients with
severe TBI and where medical staff managing the patient have clinical equipoise for the use of protocolised
hyperosmolar therapy and agree to maintain trial allocation in randomised patients.
Staff should also demonstrate and document a willingness to comply with the protocol, the principles of GCP
(Good Clinical Practice) and regulatory requirements and be prepared to participate in training. Sites will
need to establish experience with receiving and acting on protocolised advise in relation to the
administration of hyperosmolar therapy. This will be addressed with a ‘run-in’ period while the pilot phase is
ongoing with all sites having access to an educational package.

Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria
Patients will be included who:
•

Are aged >16 years old

•

Have been admitted to ICU following TBI within 10 days from initial primary head injury

•

Have an abnormal CT scan consistent with TBI

•

Have an ICP >20mmHg for more than 5 mins despite stage 1 procedures

Exclusion criteria
Patients will be excluded if they meet one or more of the following criteria:
•

Devastating brain injury with withdrawal of life sustaining treatment anticipated in the next 24 hours

•

Pregnancy

•

Severe hypernatraemia (serum Na > 155 mmol/L)

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are designed to include those who reflect the general population of
patients with severe TBI and raised ICP who may benefit from the therapeutic intervention and exclude those
patients who are unlikely to benefit owing to their underlying condition or disease trajectory.

Trial interventions
Providing the patient meets the inclusion criteria above, they will be randomly assigned to boluses of either:
-

2ml/kg 20% mannitol intravenous bolus (osmolarity = 1100 mOsm/L) – or equivalent osmolar dose
using the concentration used locally by participating study centres

-

2ml/kg 3% hypertonic saline intravenous bolus (osmolarity = 1026 mOsm/L) – or equivalent osmolar
dose using the concentration used locally by participating study centres

The IMP will be administered by clinical staff in accordance with local policy. If the ICP remains >20mmHg,
boluses of each IMP can be repeated until serum sodium reaches 155 mmol/L. If there is a second spike in
ICP to >20mmHg, allocated IMP should continue to be used.

Sample size
The planned size of this trial is 638 patients. This is based on a superiority hypothesis of a difference between
the two interventions, using 90% power, two-sided significance level of 5% with a dropout/withdrawal rate
of 6%. In order to detect a treatment reduction of 13% (63.5% to 50.5%) in the proportion of patients having
an unfavourable neurological outcome (GOS-E: dead, vegetative state, lower severe disability, upper severe
disability) compared to favourable outcome (GOS-E: lower moderate disability, upper moderate disability,

lower good recovery, upper good recovery) between mannitol and hypertonic saline, 319 patients will be
required on each arm.
The sample size was informed by the following evidence. The GOS-E is an 8-point ordinal scale (1= death and
8=upper good recovery). In studies carried out in TBI patients, this scale is often used as a dichotomous
outcome, with GOS-E categories 1-4: poor versus 5-8: good.14-17 In calculating the sample size for an ordinal
scale, there is a requirement for a proportional odds over the categories.18 Currently, there is some indication
of the violation of this proportional odds assumption (e.g. Hutchinson PJ et al.16) and for this reason the
sample size using the ordinal approach will have limitations. In light of this, for the purposes of the SOS Trial,
the GOS-E has been dichotomised in the conventional way. In addition to this, the binary approach is a more
conservative approach and analysis using the ordinal categories will furtherincrease the statistical power of
the study.
The proportion of patients with unfavourable neurological outcome on the mannitol arm range from 37%70% across trials in patients with TBI.14-17 For our trial, we have taken the worse outcome as 63.5% which is
representative of the larger trial samples as illustrated in the Rescue ICP study (Hutchinson PJ et al., 2016 60% in the mannitol arm16) and EUROTHERM trial (Andrews PJ et al., 2015 - 63.5% in the mannitol arm14).
The clinically important difference ranges from 10% to 20%.14-17 Our clinically important reduction of
proportion of patients with an unfavourable neurological outcome fits in with an achievable sample size of
638 patients as well as aiming to minimise the difference that would be considered relevant.
Finally, loss of follow-up in UK critical care trials is often low (<3%). The EUROTHERM trial (Andrews PJ et
al.14) reported a 1% withdrawal rate and the drop-out rate for the Rescue ICP study was 6% (Hutchinson PJ
et al.16). Many of the studies of patients with TBI reviewed report no withdrawal rates. In line with the Rescue
ICP study16 we have estimated a drop-out rate of 6% for the SOS Trial.

Assignment of interventions
Randomisation
Patients will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to either mannitol or HTS using a secure web-based and allocation
concealed randomisation system. In the event that the web-based system cannot be used, an emergency
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) randomisation system will also be in place.
Blinding
As key clinical parameters (urine output and serum sodium levels) monitored in TBI patients will be
influenced by the IMPs, it will not be possible or safe to blind clinical staff on the ICU as to the patient’s

treatment allocation. Investigators assessing the primary and secondary endpoints will be blinded to
treatment allocation though.

Data collection, management and analysis
Data collection
Data will be entered via an electronic case report form (eCRF). Clinical data will be collected during the ICU
stay up to 28 days after randomisation (outlined in the study schematic in Figure 1 and detailed in Table 1).
Baseline characteristics collected include patient demographics, comorbidities, pre-admission function,
inclusion/exclusion criteria, consent, GCS motor score, date/time and mechanism of TBI, temperature at
hospital admission, CT scan appearance (Marshall category 1-6), details of injuries to head and other body
systems. Daily data captured following randomisation will include core temperature, ICP, blood pressure,
ICU/hospital admission status, resource use (Critical Care Minimum Dataset (CCMDS)), AEs (treatment
failure, need for other treatments, electrolytes, renal function, renal replacement therapy), survival status.
After discharge, data will be collected on GOS-E, survival status and utilisation of community care resources
after acute hospital discharge up to 12 months after randomisation. These data will be collected by
telephone questionnaire assessment of either the patient or primary carer. Health related quality of life up
to 12 months after randomisation will be collected using the EQ-5D-5L – a generic preference-based measure
of health that is recommended by NICE for economic evaluations).
Mortality will be reported from hospital records up until discharge and tracked after discharge using the NHS
Digital tracking service, hospital records and GP records. ICU and hospital length of stay will be obtained from
local centres.

Statistical analysis
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed during the trial, submitted to the DMEC for review
and made publicly available prior to the database lock and commencement of analysis. The timing and
frequency of the interim analyses will be discussed and agreed with the DMEC members and a detailed SAP
will be written by the trial statistician and approved by the DMEC prior to any interim analysis. It is anticipated
that no more than one formal interim analysis will take place during the course of the study. In making a
decision to terminate the clinical trial, the DMEC will use the statistical evidence as guidance to their decision
making and will be also presented with a 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference.
Primary outcome analysis
The primary analysis will be conducted on all outcome data obtained from all participants as randomised and
regardless of protocol adherence, i.e. intention to treat analysis – unless a patient has specifically withdrawn
their consent regarding the use of their data. A complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis will be used to

address the issue of non-compliance.19 For the primary outcome analysis, the proportion of patients with
favourable versus unfavourable 6-month GOS-Ewill be compared between the two intervention arms using
the logistic regression model. This analysis will be adjusted for key clinically important co-variates. Odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be presented. As a supplementary analysis, the ordinal nature of the
8-point GOS-E questionnaire will also be assessed using appropriate ordinal regression models. Stacked bar
charts will be used to display the ordinal GOS-E questionnaire data.
Secondary outcomes analyses
Survival status to hospital discharge will be examined in a similar way to the binary GOS-E questionnaire. In
addition to this survival status over the course of the study (3, 6 and 12 months) and to time to discharge
(ICU and hospital) will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots. The survival curves will be assessed using the
log-rank test (unadjusted) and the Cox-proportional Hazards model (adjusted).
Continuous variables will be examined using linear regression models and summarised using mean, standard
deviation, median and range values. Categorical data will be assessed using logistic regression models and
summarised using the number of patients and proportions. Where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals will
be presented with the appropriate point estimates.
Economic analyses
A detailed Health Economics Analysis plan (HEAP) will be developed during the trial, submitted to the DMEC
for review and made publicly available prior to the database lock. Analysis will be conducted from an NHS
and personal social services perspective, adhere to the recommendations of the NICE Reference Case.20
Resource use will include intervention, hospital (ICU, HDU and ward days) and community costs (primary
care and social care costs) in the first 12 months following intervention. Resources will be costed using
national reference unit costs where available, reflated to current prices. Health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5L) responses will be used to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the value set
recommended by NICE at the time of analysis. Baseline EQ-5D-5L values will be imputed to reflect the
unconscious health state and applied to all patients, minimising potential bias in the QALY AUC
calculation.21,22
Within-trial analysis (to 12 months) using bivariate regression of costs and QALYs will inform a probabilistic
assessment of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio,23 cost-effectiveness acceptability and value-ofinformation of further research. Following best practice, missingness mechanisms will be explored and
multiple imputation methods will be used within the analysis.24 Costs and outcomes arising during the trial
will be undiscounted, reflecting the 12-month time horizon. Sensitivity and sub-group analyses will be predetermined. More extensive economic modelling using decision-analytic methods may be considered,

extending the time horizon and decision context, if costs and benefit profiles are non-convergent at 12
months.
Exploratory Bayesian analysis
In order to obtain more insight into the primary outcome, Bayesian methods will be used taking various
information from the literature.

Missing data
Every effort will be made to minimise missing baseline and outcome data in this trial. A further exploratory
analysis to assess the impact of any missing outcome data on the GOS-E questionnaire will be examined using
multiple imputation techniques.

Data monitoring
The WCTU will be responsible for trial monitoring and visits will be conducted in accordance with the trial
monitoring plan and will comply with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). On-site monitoring visits
during the trial will check the accuracy of data entered into the clinical trial database against the source
documents, adherence to the protocol, procedures and GCP, and the progress of patient recruitment and
follow-up.

Patient and public involvement
This application is informed through a series of meetings with survivors and carers of patients with previous
brain injury, facilitated through Headway West Midlands (https://www.headway.org.uk). The group are
supportive of this trial. Patient and public contributed to the trial proposal, protocol development and design
of patient facing materials. We discussed and decided together our joint position on the use of placebo, trial
outcomes and how to optimise the process for approaching, informing and consenting relatives (including
the use of professional legal representative) and optimising follow-up. During the conduct of the trial two
PPI members will join the trial management group and two will join the independent Trial Steering
Committee.
We will follow INVOLVE best practice guidance in our approach. We will meet with the PPI group at the start
of the study and regularly thereafter (monthly initially and then 3 monthly) to enable full involvement
through the trial and have included funds to support this. We will work with our PPI group to ensure that we
are all clear about expectations and jointly agree a role description, terms of reference and organisational
responsibilities including payments. Our PPI leads will be readily accessible to the group. We will provide
training and support through informal mentorship with experienced PPI and formal training through our

CRN PPI group. The PPI group will help keep patients and public informed through the progress of the trial
and lead the dissemination of the trial findings to lay persons.

Safety, ethics and dissemination
Adverse outcomes
The occurrence of adverse events related to hyperosmolar therapy are poorly reported in the published
clinical trials. The main anticipated potential adverse events are electrolyte disturbance and acute kidney
injury. Adverse event/reactions will be assessed for seriousness and reported in accordance with MHRA
guidelines.

Regulatory and ethics approvals
The East of England - Essex Research Ethics Committee (REC: 19/EE/0228 - flagged for trials involving clinical
trials in patients without capacity) and Medical Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA) (EudraCT:XXXXXXX)
have approved the study protocol. The trial registration number is XXXXXXX. The study will comply with the
principles for sharing clinical trial data from publicly funded clinical trials.

Confidentiality
In order to maintain confidentiality, all CRFs, questionnaires, study reports and communication regarding the
study will identify the patients by the assigned unique trial identifier and initials only. Patient confidentiality
will be maintained at every stage and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws and regulations.

Dissemination
The study will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
guidelines.20 The study findings will be presented at national and international meetings with abstracts online. Presentation at these meetings will ensure that results and any implications quickly reach all of the UK
and international intensive care community. In accordance with the open access policies proposed by the
NIHR, we aim to publish the clinical findings of the trial as well as a paper describing the cost-effectiveness
in the NHS setting in high quality peer-reviewed open access (via Pubmed) journals. The NIHR HTA also
requires that a detailed study report is published in the HTA journal. Finally, an on-going update of the trial
will also be provided on the Warwick Clinical Trials Unit website and social media platforms e.g. Twitter
(@sos_trial).

Discussion
While mannitol has been the traditional hyperosmolar agent of choice in the management of raised ICP, use
of HTS as first line therapy is increasing in the UK. The reasons for this shift remain unclear and may relate to
perceived benefits in cardiovacscularly unstable polytrauma patients. However, what is clear is that there
remains limited high quality trial evidence to support this change and potential for harm e.g. hypernatraemia.
The SOS Trial has therefore been designed as an open and pragmatic clinical trial to determine the
comparative clinical and cost effectiveness of mannitol vs HTS in adult patients with TBI and raised ICP.
Results will also complement the French COBI trial comparing continuous hypertonic saline therapy against
mannitol21 and will allow the possibility for an individual patient data network meta-analysis in the future.
The study protocol has been carefully designed with the support of clinicians in recruiting study centres to
reflect and mirror ICP management pathways in routine clinical use. Through this, we hope to maximise
patient recruitment and clinician engagement. As a range of concentrations of HTS are in use nationally to
treat raised ICP, recruiting study centres will be allowed to use the standard concentration of HTS in use
locally but in an equi-osmolar dose to match 2ml/kg of 3% HTS. We have also chosen an ICP threshold of
20mmHg for >5 minutes based on ICP management pathways acquired from recruiting study centres and
previous large randomised controlled trials in this area.14,22 The sodium threshold for cessation of
osmotherapy was set at 155mmol/l following discussions with experts in the field and recruiting centres. We
acknowledge this is potentially lower than some clinicians would consider unsafe to proceed with further
boluses of osmotherapy but feel this reflects routine clinical practice. However, we will monitor the effect
this has on the study during the pilot stage of the study and review the threshold if required by the data
monitoring committee or trial steering committee.
As with other trials in this clinical area, blinding to the intervention drugs was considered to be impractical
and costly.9 This is because as highlighted, mannitol has a signature side effect causing a marked diuresis and
hypertonic saline administration results in a rise in serum sodium levels. It would therefore not be possible
to conceal treatment allocation without adversely affecting overall care of the patient (i.e. it would not be
safe or practical to hide urine output or sodium levels in a critically ill patient with TBI) which is a potential
limitation of the study design. To overcome this potential bias, the study design therefore includes blinded
assessment of primary and other outcomes to minimise bias from knowledge of treatment assignment.
The inclusion of a placebo arm for the study was also carefully considered but also rejected for a number of
reasons. In a survey of ICU, emergency medicine and neurosurgical clinicians conducted in advance of the
HTA application, 80% of respondents were willing to randomise to mannitol or hypertonic saline but only
10% were willing to randomise to placebo. This would adversely affect enrolment and would risk
contamination/cross over. This lack of equipoise is also consistent with the latest Brain Trauma Foundation

guidelines which state “the committee is universal in its belief that hyperosmolar agents are useful in the
care of patient with severe TBI”. It was also considered unlikely that the in the setting of current practice and
beliefs, that the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive could be fulfilled in demonstrating a “direct
clinically relevant benefit” for placebo. Finally, discussions with patient and public partners involved in the
trial, indicated there was discomfort regarding the inclusion of a placebo arm.
In conclusion, it remains unclear whether there is a treatment benefit to the use of either mannitol or
hypertonic saline in the management of raised ICP after severe TBI. If results from the SOS Trial show the
superiority of hypertonic saline over mannitol in improving neurological long term outcomes, then this has
the potential to change clinical practice in the acute management of patients with raised ICP.
