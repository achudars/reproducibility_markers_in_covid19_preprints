Abstract
Objective
In some patients with apraxia of speech (AOS), we observed impaired perceptual timing
abilities, which lead us to propose a shared mechanism of impaired perceptual timing
underlying impaired rhythm discrimination (perceptual processing) and AOS (motor speech
output). Given that considerable white matter damage is often observed in these patients, we
here investigate whether white matter changes are related to impaired rhythm processing as one
possible mechanism underlying AOS.
Methods
We applied deformation-based morphometry (DBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 12
patients with the nonfluent variant (NFV) of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) with AOS, as
well as 11 patients with the semantic variant and 24 controls.
Results
Seventy-five percent of the patients with NFV displayed impaired rhythm processing and the
severity of their impairment correlated with their degree of AOS. Moreover, left frontal white
matter volume loss adjacent to the supplementary motor area (SMA) correlated with impaired
rhythm processing. In addition, we obtained tract-based metrics of the left Aslant tract, which
is typically damaged in NFV. The structural integrity of the left Aslant tract also correlated with
rhythmic discrimination abilities in NFV.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that a shared white matter substrate adjacent to the SMA contributes to
impaired rhythm perception and motor speech impairments. This indicates that impaired
perceptual timing may be one of the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying AOS. Our

Introduction
The nonfluent variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (NFV) is characterized by apraxia of
speech (AOS) or agrammatism and impaired sentence comprehension1–3. NFV is
phenotypically heterogeneous: impaired AOS and agrammatism can arise in combination or
isolation and hence give rise to three possible subtypes: primary progressive apraxia of speech
(ppAOS), progressive agrammatic aphasia or mixed agrammatism and AOS4–7. This clinical
heterogeneity suggests a diversity of underlying neuroanatomical substrates. The present work
focuses on the in-depth characterization of the mechanism and substrate underpinning AOS.
Previously, grey matter atrophy has been consistently found in NFV in the left opercular part
(BA44) of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula, premotor and the supplementary motor areas
(SMA)1,8. Involvement of the SMA and the left lateral superior premotor cortex is linked to
ppAOS4,9,10. In the ppAOS phenotype, more focal neurodegeneration of the (pre)motor cortex
was observed compared to widespread atrophy extending to the frontotemporal regions in
progressive agrammatic aphasia6,7.
Neuropathologically, NFV is somewhat heterogeneous, with a dominance of tau pathology in
up to 88% of patients (either Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal degeneration
(CBD) or Pick’s disease) and otherwise TDP43 proteinopathy or Alzheimer’s disease11–14.
Frontal white matter changes are more common in NFV caused by tauopathies15, especially in
CBD16. At present, in-depth knowledge about the relation between phenotype, structural
changes and neuropathology are lacking, whereas a better understanding of this relationship is
necessary for targeted development of pharmacological therapy and the implementation of
potential clinical trials. So far, neuroimaging studies have mainly focused on grey matter
changes. It has been postulated that also white matter changes will contribute to the NFV
phenotype, for instance to executive dysfunction17 or impaired speech production18,19. Here, we
specifically test whether white matter changes in NFV relate to impaired non-linguistic

processing using non-verbal rhythmic auditory stimuli which do not convey meaning. This is
motivated by our previous finding that processing of short sequences of auditory stimuli, more
specifically the discrimination of metrical sequences, is significantly impaired in NFV20.
Because impaired rhythm discrimination co-occurs with AOS, we hypothesized that both
deficits are related through a common impairment in a “temporal scaffolding mechanism”,
which structures input and output in time20,21. Consistent with this finding, grey matter atrophy
in the left SMA and in the right caudate was associated with impaired performance on a
temporal regularity task using spoken syllables22. However, prior studies were not designed to
evaluate the possible contribution of white matter damage.
In the current study, we have expanded our previously published dataset20 to now include 12
NFV patients who received auditory testing and volumetric imaging. By focusing on white
matter abnormalities, we aim to elucidate the neuroanatomical correlate of the hypothesized
temporal scaffolding mechanism. This will aid us in understanding the neurocomputational
abnormalities which give rise to AOS. We investigate a correlation between rhythm perception
deficits and tensor-based deformations of the whole brain (deformation-based morphometry,
DBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In the current study, we opted for DBM rather than
voxel-based morphometry (VBM) because automated segmentation in regions of abnormal
grey and white matter might be unreliable and because DBM in addition allows visualization
of changes in subcortical structures containing grey and white matter23. Furthermore, we
complement DBM with DTI. DTI is sensitive to white matter damage caused by tau pathology,
which frequently underlies the NFV phenotype24,25. We focused on the left frontal Aslant tract,
which connects BA44 to medial frontal areas including the SMA26. Damage of the left Aslant
tract is considered specific for the NFV phenotype19,27. Because it connects IFG with SMA,
which has been previously identified as a gray matter correlate of temporal regularity
processing in NFV28, the left Aslant tract might also play a role in temporal scaffolding. Our

approach aims to clarify the relationship between AOS, rhythm discrimination and their
potentially overlapping anatomical substrate to elucidate the phenotypical heterogeneity in
NFV.

Methods
Participants
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee, University Hospitals Leuven. All
participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
PPA patients were recruited via the memory clinic University Hospitals Leuven. A consecutive
series of 38 patients who fulfilled the international consensus criteria for PPA1 enrolled for the
experiment (2011-2019). The first 23 patients are the cohort which was described in 20, and the
same case numbers will be used for consistency. Seven of the 38 patients had to be excluded
for the following reasons: hearing loss (n = 3); lack of ability to perform the experimental tasks
according to practice runs due to disease severity (n = 2); lack of cooperation (n = 1); unique
phenotype (foreign accent syndrome, n = 1). The remaining 31 patients were able and
sufficiently cooperative to undergo the extensive psychoacoustic testing and produce reliable
data. Before the study, each patient was classified according to the 2011 recommendations1.
The classification relied on the clinical evaluation by an experienced neurologist (R.V.), in
combination with neurolinguistics assessment and clinical MRI, as well as, where available,
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET ([18F]-FDG PET), CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease and
[11C]-Pittsburgh compound B amyloid PET. Twelve cases were classified as NFV (Table 1),
11 as the semantic variant of PPA (SV), and 8 as the logopenic variant (LV). The LV group
will not be discussed further because of the smaller sample size compared to the NFV and SV
groups. Of the 12 NFV cases, all exhibited AOS on clinical examination and 5 patients (case

20-23 and 31) also displayed single-word comprehension deficits upon testing and would also
fit the more recently described criteria for the “mixed variant”2,29. All patients received a
volumetric MRI scan and 7 NFV and 7 SV DTI imaging. Twenty-nine healthy controls (15
male, age range 51-76, education range 9-22 years) underwent psychoacoustic testing, 24 of
these controls received volumetric MRI and 20 DTI imaging. Hearing sensitivity was measured
in all participants using a clinical Bekesy-type audiometer for frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and
8Hz, on the left and right ear, respectively. In the pure-tone audiograms, all participants were
able to detect stimuli of up to 1000 Hz below a hearing level of 30 dB on at least one side.

Behavioral testing
Neuropsychological testing consisted of confrontation naming by means of the Boston Naming
test using Dutch Norms. Non-verbal executive functioning was evaluated by means of the
Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices. Repetition was assessed using the Akense Afasie test.
To assess AOS, the Diagnostisch Instrument voor Apraxie van de Spraak (DIAS) was added to
the cognitive test battery when it became available (for this reason it was not performed in cases
6, 13, 15 & 21). The DIAS consists of vowel and consonant repetition (15 trials each) and
diadochokinesis testing. During the latter task, the examiner first reads three successive
alternating syllables aloud, e.g., “pa ta ka” and asks the patient to repeat these once. If the patient
was able to repeat this sequence correctly, he/she was asked to repeat it as many times as
possible during a period of 8 s. The diadochokinesis severity score is then the total sum of
correctly repeated syllables in this period. Grammaticality was assessed using the auditory
sentence comprehension test of the Werkwoorden en Zinnen Test (WEZT). This test consists
of 40 sentence-picture matching trials, using active or passive sentences with possible role
reversal (e.g. “the horse was kicked by the cow”).

Rhythm perception
The psychoacoustic testing session comprised 4 pre-existing tasks of perceptual rhythm and
timing (r1-r4)20(Fig 1). The rhythm tasks followed a two-alternative forced choice algorithm.
Depending on preference and ability, participants responded verbally or by pointing to a
graphical scheme showing the possible options. Instruction, verbally and graphically, were
repeated until the subject confirmed they understood the task. Five practice trials were repeated
until five consecutive correct responses were recorded, and if needed, instructions were
repeated and the nature of the errors was explained. If the subject indicated during the test phase
that they had forgotten the instructions, the instructions were repeated, the practice trials run
again and the test phase then restarted.
All tasks used 500 Hz 100 ms pure tones. Outcome measures were the thresholds obtained by
adaptively adjusting the difference between reference and target stimuli. The difference was
varied as a relative proportion of the duration or tempo of the reference. The basic ‘Single timeinterval duration discrimination’ task (r1) required participants to indicate which of two tone
pairs comprised the ‘longer gap’ than the reference of varying duration (inter-onset interval of
300–600 ms). In the ‘Isochrony deviation detection’ task (r2; 50 trials), participants were
required to indicate which of two otherwise isochronous five-tone sequences contained a
lengthening or ‘extra gap’. The reference sequence had an isochronous interonset interval
ranging from 300 to 600 ms, the target had one lengthened interonset interval between the third
and fourth tone. In the ‘Metrical pattern discrimination’ tasks (r3, r4; 50 trials), participants
were required to decide which of three rhythmic sequences (the second or the third) of seven
tones each sounded ‘different’, or ‘wrong’, based on a distortion (or change) in the rhythm. The
reference sequence had a strongly (r3) or a weakly (r4) metrical beat of 4.

Statistical analysis
The analysis of the rhythm tasks was identical to the procedure we have described in prior
work20. Outcome measures were log-transformed to allow for parametric analysis at the group
level. At the individual level, each PPA patient’s performance was analyzed in comparison to
the group by using a modified Crawford t-test30. For the comparison between each individual
patient and the controls, to facilitate comparison between tasks and to enable Bonferroni
correction, the exact P values (estimated percentiles) calculated according to Crawford and
Garthwaite were transformed into normalized Z-scores using the standard normal cumulative
distribution function. The significance threshold was set to Z = 2.24 equaling a one-tailed
significance level of P<0.05, Bonferroni-corrected for the number of tests (n = 4). We compared
the rhythm test scores between NFV and SV using a Student’s t-test (one-tailed significance
level of P<0.05). In 8 NFV, behavioral measures of AOS and grammaticality were obtained.
We correlated these measures to the rhythm test scores to evaluate the link between impaired
rhythm discrimination and AOS (one-tailed significance level of P<0.05).

Twenty-three patients (12 NFV and 11 SV), and 24 healthy controls received a high resolution
T1-weighted structural MRI. All controls and 13 patients were scanned on a 3 T Philips Intera
system equipped with an 8-channel receive-only head coil (Philips SENSitivity Encoding head
coil). Ten patients were scanned on a 3T Philips Achieva dstream scanner equipped with a 32channel head volume coil. For structural imaging, an identical 3D turbo field echo sequence
was used on both systems (coronal inversion recovery prepared 3D gradient-echo images,
inversion time (TI) 900 ms, shot interval = 3000 ms, echo time (TE) = 4.6 ms, flip angle 8
degrees, 182 slices, voxel size 0.98 x 0.98 x 1.2 mm³). The diffusion weighted images consisted
of 45 directions of diffusion weighting with a b = 800 as well as 1 non-diffusion weighted image
(B0), acquired in the axial plane, with isotropic voxel size of 2.2 mm, TR 9900 ms, TE 90 ms,
flip angle 90, fold over direction AP, fat shift direction A (anterior), in-plane parallel image
acceleration (SENSE) factor 2.5.

Deformation-based morphometry
DBM was performed using the CAT12 toolbox (Structural brain mapping group, Jena,
Germany, http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat), an extension of SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre
for Neuroimaging, London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Segmentation was
performed in CAT12 using a default tissue probability map. Local adaptive segmentation was
used at default strength (medium) and Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through
Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) was used for registration to the default template
(IXI555_MNI152). Voxel size for normalized images was set at 1.5 mm (isotropic) after
internal resampling at 1mm. Local deformations were estimated using the Jacobian
determinant, while ignoring the affine part of the deformation field. Thus, additional correction
for total intracranial volume is not required31. Images were smoothed using a 8 x 8 x 8 mm³
Gaussian kernel. Deformation fields of healthy controls and both PPA subtypes were compared

using a one-way between-subject ANOVA. Multiple linear regression was used to correlate
rhythm tests (r1-r4) at the individual level to local deformations of the grey and white matter
within each PPA subtype group. Scanner type and age were introduced as a nuisance variable
in all analyses. Threshold of significance was set at voxel-level uncorrected P<0.001 and
cluster-level FWE-corrected P<0.0520. To confirm that these changes were related to white
matter involvement, a supplementary VBM analysis using segmented white matter maps was
performed in which total intracranial volume (TIV) was added as a nuisance variable and the
outcome of the DBM analysis was used for small volume correction.

Diffusion Tensor Imaging
Diffusion images were preprocessed and analyzed with MRTRIX3. The preprocessing pipeline
included the following steps in order of use: first, the data were converted from DICOM to MIF
using mrconvert. Using dwidenoise, diffusion data were denoised; subject motion, eddy current
artefacts were corrected for as well using dwidenoise (which relies on FSL eddy); following
these two steps, the preprocessed diffusion data were bias-corrected with dwibiascorrect. The
diffusion data were rigidly aligned to the subject’s T1-weighted volume space using Advanced
Normalization Tools (ANTs) and tensor reorientation was performed. Fractional anisotropy
(FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) was calculated in subject-space and normalized to MNI space.
The calculated tensors were then used to carry out a whole brain tractography using the
probabilistic Tensor (Tensor_Prob), combined with anatomically constrained tractography with
seeding along the grey/white matter interface, and 2 million streamlines to be selected 32. The
whole brain tractogram was then segmented using volumes of interest (VOIs) acquired from
the Freesurfer aparc+aseg parcellation33,34. These VOIs were pars opercularis of the IFG and
the superior frontal gyrus, specifically selecting the Aslant tract on diffusion MR data26.

Freesurfer aparc+aseg parcellation was performed to obtain these subject-specific VOIs. For
this reason preprocessing of T1-weighted structural MRIs was repeated using FMRIPREP35,36,
a Nipype37 based tool. T1-weighted volume was corrected for intensity non-uniformity using
N4BiasFieldCorrection v2.1.038 and skull-stripped using antsBrainExtraction.sh v2.1.0 (using
the OASIS template). Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all from FreeSurfer
v6.0.139, and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the
method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray
matter40. Spatial normalization to the ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version
2009c was performed through nonlinear registration with the antsregistration tool of ANTs
v2.1.0 using brain-extracted versions of both T1-weighted structural MRI and template. Brain
tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and gray matter was performed on the
brain-extracted T1-weighted structural MRI using fast (FSL v5.0.9).
MD and FA were compared between controls and PPA subtypes using a between-subject
ANOVA on the smoothed FA and MD maps using the same threshold as before. Scanner type,
TIV and age were introduced as a nuisance variables. A template for the left Aslant tract was
generated for healthy controls using the 75% overlap threshold26. FA and MD of the left Aslant
tract were extracted for each PPA patient by averaging values from all voxels included in the
template derived from healthy controls26. We compared the FA and MD between the NFV and
SV by means of a Student’s t-test (one-tailed P<0.05). FA and MD were correlated to the
rhythm test scores within the NFV group to confirm the DBM findings (one-tailed P<0.05).

Results

Rhythm perception results
Performance on the rhythm tasks was poorer in NFV compared to controls (Fig 2AB): mean Z
scores were above the preset threshold (P<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected) in NFV for
discrimination of strongly metrical sequences (r3, mean Z: 2.94), discrimination of weakly
metrical sequences (r4, mean: 2.93) and isochrony deviation detection (r2, mean: 2.46) (Fig
2B). We compared the rhythm test scores between the NFV and SV. This confirmed worse
scores in NFV for the discrimination of weakly metrical sequences (r4, P = 0.001) (Fig 2AB),
with. A trend was further found for single-time interval discrimination (r1, P = 0.051).
At the individual level, deficits were observed mainly in NFV after correction for the number
of perceptual timing tasks performed (Z > 2.24) (Fig 2C). On the weakly metrical pattern
discrimination task (r4), 7 NFV (Fig 2C) and 2 SV were significantly impaired. Similarly,
strongly metrical pattern discrimination (r3) was impaired in 6 NFV (Fig 2C) and 4 SV, as well
as isochrony deviation detection (r2) in 6 NFV (Fig 2C) and 2 SV patients. Single time-interval
discrimination (r1) was impaired in 4 NFV (Fig 2C) and 1 SV patient. In summary, 75% of
NFV were impaired in one or more of the rhythm and timing tasks and 36.4% of SV.

Correlation with behavioral measures of speech
A subset of 8 patients with NFV performed specific behavioral tests to quantify the severity of
AOS and agrammatism. In these participants, repetition of consonants was more difficult when
single time-interval duration discrimination (r1, r = -0.84, P = 0.009), isochrony deviation
detection (r2, r = -0.73, P = 0.040) and strongly metrical pattern discrimination (r3, r = -0.75, P

diadochokinesis. Grammaticality scores were lower when single time-interval duration
discrimination (r1, r = -0.81, P = 0.014) and strongly metrical pattern discrimination (r3, r = 0.73, P = 0.039) were impaired. Repetition of consonants was highly correlated with
grammaticality scores in our cohort (r = 0.90, p = 0.002).

White matter changes: Deformation-based morphometry
A comparison between healthy controls and PPA subtypes displayed the expected pattern of
changes of the local deformation field. In NFV, loss of volume was observed mainly in the
frontal lobes, with left-sided predominance (Fig 3AB). In SV, loss of volume was localized to
the anterior temporal lobes (Fig 3A). In the NFV group, voxel-wise multiple linear regression
showed that impairment on the strongly metrical rhythm discrimination task (r3) negatively
correlated with changes in the deformation field in the left frontal white matter (MNI = -20,20,36; -17,8,48; -9,39,50; kE 2426 voxels, Z score: 4.92) (Fig 4AB). This negative correlation
indicates that poorer discrimination is linked to more volume loss. For illustrative purposes, we
plotted the individual NFV thresholds for the strongly metrical discrimination task (r3) versus
volume loss in this region (Pearson’s R = -0.316, P < 0.001) (Fig 4C). This loss of volume was
more regional than the widespread loss of volume observed at the level of the between-group
comparison (Fig 3AB). An additional VBM analysis using segmented white matter maps of the
NFV patients confirmed that the loss of volume was related to white matter changes (5 clusters
surviving the preset significance threshold, largest cluster: MNI = -8,48,30; kE 203 voxels, Z =
3.74). In the SV group, DBM analysis yielded no significant correlations with the rhythm test
scores.

White matter changes: Diffusion Tensor Imaging
A comparison between NFV, SV and controls showed reduced FA in NFV in the left inferior
frontal region, the corpus callosum and the anterior cingulate (Fig 5A). MD was widely
increased in NFV, with a predominance in the both frontal lobes (Fig 5B). In SV, FA was
reduced and MD was increased compared to controls in both anterior temporal lobes (not
shown). We then compared FA and MD between NFV and SV specifically within the template
of the left Aslant tract calculated on 20 healthy controls. FA was similar between NFV and SV
(P=0.175, Fig 5C). MD was higher in NFV compared to SV (P = 0.038, Fig 5D). In NFV, MD
in the left Aslant tract was increased when the performance on the strongly metrical rhythm
discrimination task was weaker (r3) (r = 0.815, P = 0.026) and a trend was observed with FA (r
= - 0.708, P = 0.075). FA and MD in the left Aslant tract did not correlate with performance on
any other rhythm task in NFV (r1,r2,r4, all P>0.231). Visual inspection of the left Aslant tract
in NFV showed that this tract overlapped with the region in which also DBM identified white
matter volume changes (Fig 5E).

Discussion

By investigating whether white matter changes are linked to perceptual timing impairments in
AOS, we aim here to elucidate the link between the clinical heterogeneity and structural
abnormalities. We proposed a shared mechanism for impaired rhythm discrimination and
AOS20, whereby the impact of disrupted temporal scaffolding might well extend beyond the

linguistic domain. Behaviorally, we here observed a correlation between impaired rhythm
discrimination and the degree of AOS. Using DBM, we found atrophy in the left frontal lobe
to be correlated with the rhythm discrimination impairment in NFV. We complemented the
DBM analysis with DTI in order to provide an independent measure of structural integrity of
white matter. Specifically, we focused on the left Aslant tract because this tract has been
implicated in motor speech deficits in NFV specifically19,26,27. DTI results further confirmed a
correlation between damage to the left Aslant tract and impaired rhythm perception in our NFV
cohort. Our findings link impaired perceptual timing of incoming non-linguistic auditory
signals to degeneration of the left frontal Aslant tract. Given the prior work implicating the left
Aslant tract to motor speech production deficits in NFV19,26,27, we here identify it as a relevant
(part of a) common anatomical substrate for impaired rhythm discrimination and AOS. This
observation provides additional insight into the neurocomputational mechanism of distorted
speech, namely how temporal irregularities are introduced into the spontaneous speech patterns
in NFV.
While we used metrical sequences to test rhythm discrimination in NFV20, impaired regularity
discrimination was also observed in NFV using spoken syllables22. The observation that
impaired regularity discrimination in NFV also applies to syllables was viewed by the authors
as additional support for the hypothesis that a disrupted generic temporal scaffolding
mechanism would also have an impact on linguistic processing in NFV. Here, we observed a
concrete shared white matter substrate, the left frontal Aslant tract, which might contribute to
impaired rhythm perception as well as motor speech impairments. In particular, our DBM
findings locate the relevant white matter degeneration in the left frontal Aslant tract close to the
SMA, which was previously linked to temporal regularity discrimination41 and AOS6,9. The
Aslant tract connects the superior frontal gyrus/SMA to IFG, the region which displays the most
pronounced atrophy in early NFV42. Agrammatism has been linked to grey matter damage in

left BA4443 and white matter damage in the adjacent left anterior inferior and middle frontal
regions and uncinate fasciculus7, which connects IFG to the temporal lobe18,26. Greater white
matter changes anterior to the motor regions were found in patients with primary agrammatic
aphasia compared to patients with both agrammatism and AOS7. The close anatomical
proximity of IFG and the left Aslant tract could explain why agrammatism and AOS often occur
simultaneously in NFV (as evidenced once more by behavioral testing in our cohort), but also
why these deficits can occur in isolation5,44. Our findings suggest that temporal processing
impairment implies white matter involvement of the left frontal Aslant tract adjacent to the
premotor regions. Our work about the neurocomputational mechanism of perceptual timing and
AOS as such complements the notion that the neuroanatomical substrate of agrammatism is in
closer proximity to IFG6,7,9. The clinical relevance of our study and related neuroimaging
research is that regional variations in left frontal lobe atrophy are linked to the phenotypical
heterogeneity in NFV. Some have advocated a fairly strict separation between ppAOS and
progressive agrammatic aphasia4–7. Evidence for the existence of separate subgroups was also
derived from data-driven clustering analysis, which grouped isolated agrammatism as separate
group of PPA44. Whether lumping AOS and agrammatism into one phenotype or not, a detailed
clinical evaluation, namely specifying whether AOS and/or agrammatism occurs in NFV, can
be considered useful both from the clinical and scientific viewpoint.
White matter damage is at least part of the underlying cause of impaired rhythm perception and
speech apraxia in NFV, which we interpret as a disrupted shared mechanism of temporal
scaffolding. We hypothesize that these white matter changes reflect tau pathology. Tau
pathology is the most frequently found pathology in NFV13,14 and white matter abnormalities
have been reported extensively in tauopathies. White matter atrophy has previously been linked
to behavioural changes in tauopathies45,46 using VBM. However, even though voxelwise
analysis is generally accepted, normalization errors cannot be completely excluded when using
20

VBM or DBM47. For this reason, we complemented our investigations with tract-based statistics
from diffusion-weighted imaging. DTI imaging is sensitive to changes caused by tau pathology
at the single-subject level24, presumably because of underlying glial pathology48, e.g. by severe
myelin injury or a change in other structures that create barriers for water diffusion18. However,
neuropathological data to unequivocally link our findings to tau pathology is lacking in all but
2 patients, nor can we discriminate between the neuropathologically different types of tau
pathology, i.e. PSP, CBD or Pick’s disease.
In conclusion, left frontal white matter changes were found to correlate with impaired rhythm
discrimination in NFV. The left Aslant tract was identified as the anatomical substrate of this
impaired temporal scaffolding mechanism. By revealing a shared white matter substrate in
temporal processing of auditory input and speech output, we increase the mechanistic
understanding of the neurological origin of motor speech impairment, specifically AOS, and
provide additional evidence that generic processing impairments explain part of the NFV
phenotype.
