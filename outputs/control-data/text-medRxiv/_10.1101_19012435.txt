Abstract

Background

Asthma diagnosis in the community is often made without objective testing.
Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a stepwise objective
diagnostic verification algorithm among patients with community-diagnosed asthma in the United
States (US).
Methods

We developed a probabilistic time-in-state cohort model that compared a stepwise asthma
verification algorithm based on spirometry and methacholine challenge test against the current
standard of care over 20 years. Model input parameters were informed from the literature and with
original data analyses when required. The target population was US adults (≥15 y/o) with physiciandiagnosed asthma. The final outcomes were costs (in 2018 $) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs),
discounted at 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were undertaken to examine the
effect of alternative assumptions and uncertainty in model parameters on the results.
Results

In a simulated cohort of 10,000 adults with diagnosed asthma, the stepwise algorithm resulted in the
removal of diagnosis in 3,366. This was projected to be associated with savings of $36.26 million in
direct costs and a gain of 4,049.28 QALYs over 20 years. Extrapolating these results to the US
population indicated an undiscounted potential savings of $56.48 billion over 20 years. Results were
robust against alternative assumptions and plausible changes in values of input parameters.
Conclusion

Implementation of a simple diagnostic testing algorithm to verify asthma diagnosis might result in
substantial savings and improvement in patients’ quality of life.

Introduction

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease, globally and in the United States (US) . According to
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma prevalence continues to rise; the agestandardized prevalence increased by 1.5% per year since 2001, reaching 8.4% in 2010 . There are
approximately 11 million patients with physician-diagnosed asthma in the US , and total costs of
asthma in the US was estimated to be $81.9 billion in 2013 . The annual incremental direct medical
costs of adult asthma were reported to be $3,266 per patient per year (in 2016 $) .

Evidence-based guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of asthma be made based on objective
testing for reversible airflow obstruction or variability in lung function . In some patients spirometry
testing may be inconclusive; such patients may require provocative testing to document the presence
of airway hyper-responsiveness. In reality, for many Americans, the diagnosis of asthma is made on
clinical grounds alone . This approach can be inaccurate and can result in labelling individuals with
asthma who otherwise have occasional respiratory symptoms without airflow obstruction. In
addition, many asthma patients experience spontaneous clinical remission . While the underlying
inflammatory process can remain active, such patients may not experience symptoms of asthma for
long periods of time even if they discontinue their therapies . Due to these factors, a significant
proportion of asthma patients in the community might be inappropriately treated. In a multicenter,
population-based prospective Canadian cohort study, Aaron et al followed 613 participants who
reported a physician diagnosis of asthma within the previous five years and applied an objective
algorithm to verify the existing asthma diagnosis. They found that more than 30% of participants
could have their current diagnosis of asthma ruled out and safely discontinue their medications .

Extrapolating these figures to the US indicates that there are potentially more than 3 million adults
with an over-diagnosis of asthma. As such, the economic burden of over-diagnosed asthma warrants
attention. Medication costs are the largest component of the direct economic burden of asthma,
contributing to over half of the disease-related costs . Patients with misdiagnosed asthma will incur
these costs without gaining benefit, and are subject to harm due to the adverse effects of therapy as
well as the lost opportunity to appropriately treat other health conditions that might be responsible
for their symptoms.

In this context, a pressing public health question is whether a secondary verification of asthma
diagnosis can be considered an efficient use of healthcare resources. A previous study on the
economic impact of asthma screening strategies was limited to assessing asthma-related cost savings
from implementing a secondary screening program in Canada . This study did not evaluate the
effects on health outcomes, such as asthma control and quality of life.
12

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of objective diagnostic testing
for asthma among previously diagnosed adults in the US. We calculated the incremental average costs
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the implementation of objective diagnostic
testing. We extrapolated the results to the entire US adult asthma population to evaluate the
population-level impact of implementing such a strategy.
Methods

In reporting on the study’s methodology and results we followed the Consolidated Health Economic
Evaluation Reporting Standards . The target population for this cost-effectiveness analysis was US
adults (≥15 y/o) with self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma. The diagnostic verification was
assumed to be conducted during routine outpatient encounters (e.g., during a scheduled follow-up
visit). The main outcomes of the analysis were the incremental costs and QALYs associated with the
use of diagnostic verification, compared with the current standard of care (status quo: no further
verification of diagnosed asthma). We adopted a third-party payer’s perspective (e.g., a Health
Maintenance Organization) in the main analysis, and a societal perspective in a secondary analysis.
The time horizon was 20 years, and costs and QALYs were discounted at the rate of 3% based on
recommendations of the US Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine .

The intervention

The comparator, the status quo, was the continuation of asthma management without any further
evaluation of diagnosis. The intervention was defined as a two-stage diagnostic verification algorithm,
as illustrated in Figure 1. In accordance with care standards set by the Global Initiative for Asthma
(GINA) , the first step is spirometry with reversibility testing before and after inhaled

bronchodilation. Asthma is verified in this step if the forced expiratory volume in the first second of
expiration (FEV ) improves by at least 12% and by 200 millilitres . Those who do not exhibit
reversible airflow obstruction undergo a single methacholine challenge test (MCT) at a second visit.
Individuals whose FEV decreases by 20% or more after breathing up to 8 mg/ml of methacholine (in a
stepwise fashion based on doubling the methacholine dose) are considered to have their asthma
confirmed. Individuals whose MCT is negative are considered to have their asthma ruled out and it
was assumed that their asthma-related medications could be tapered off. The use of one MCT, as
opposed to up to three MCTs implemented in the research context, was considered to be the most
realistic scenario for clinical practice.

Modeling approach

We constructed a decision tree to model the diagnostic steps, and a time-in-state model to follow
individuals at terminal branches of the tree over the analysis’ time horizon in annual cycles. The
model stratified US adult (≥15 years old) with diagnosed asthma into age (with 5-year intervals) and
sex groups. A schematic illustration of the decision tree, with point estimates of branch probabilities,
is provided in Figure 2. The major input parameters for the model are provided in Table 1.
The proportion of individuals at each branch of the decision tree was directly taken from the
population-based study by Aaron et al . In the status quo scenario, 33% of individuals were assumed
not to have asthma. These are the individuals who responded negatively to spirometry and three
subsequent MCTs in the above-mentioned study. Given that there will be no verification of diagnosis,
these individuals remained ‘over-diagnosed’ throughout the time horizon of the study (and as such
continued to be treated for asthma) under the status quo strategy.
10

In the diagnostic verification scenario, 15% of patients will have their asthma confirmed through a
positive spirometry; of the remaining, 48% will have their asthma confirmed through a positive MCT.
A diagnosis of asthma in individuals with a negative spirometry and a negative MCT will be considered
to have been ruled out and these individuals will be advised to taper their medications. In the study
by Aaron et al, in 10% of such individuals the asthma diagnosis was later confirmed with a positive
second or third MCT, after tapering of controller medications (Table 1 – section 1.1). This figure is
similar to the study by Luks et al (9%) and reflects imperfect sensitivity of MCT especially when the

patient is receiving asthma medications . Given that only one MCT is modeled in the diagnostic
verification scenario in the present study, such individuals constitute the ‘false negative’ subgroup
(those in whom an asthma diagnosis was erroneously reversed), with the rest of individuals under this
branch of the decision tree constituting the ‘true negative’ subgroup (Figure 2). Compared to their
counterparts in the status quo scenario, individuals in the false negative asthma subgroup will cease
their controller medication, and as such will generally have worse asthma control.
16,17

Modeling asthma status over time

At terminal branches of the decision tree, each of these sub-populations was linked to its
corresponding time-in-state model. Such models simulated the transition of a sex- and age-stratified
population across mutually exclusive health states. For individuals with either true asthma or
misdiagnosed asthma (true positive and false negative subgroups in Figure 2), the model contained
three states pertaining to the three levels of asthma control were assigned, in addition to a state
representing death. The distribution of levels of asthma control within a given sex and age group was
derived using calibration techniques from a recent study based on US National Health and Wellness
Survey, as described in our previous work (see distribution of asthma control in Online Repository
Materials - Section A). The levels of asthma control were defined based on the asthma control test
(ACT). This test classifies a patient’s asthma status into “poorly controlled” (scores ≤ 15), “not well
controlled” (score 16-19), and “well controlled” (score 20-25) . In addition to asthma control, we
modeled asthma exacerbations for individuals with true asthma as an event that are likely to be
affected by controller therapy (see modeling asthma exacerbation in Online Repository Materials Section B). On the other hand, in the subgroup with true negative and false positive asthma, the
model consisted of only two states of “alive” and “dead”. Aside from mortality due to severe
exacerbations, the probability of transitioning to death for all populations was equal to the age- and
sex-specific background mortality rates, derived from the US life tables .
18,19

It is likely that the degree of airway reactivity is an independent determinant of asthma control. As
such, the distribution of asthma control levels can be different among individuals whose asthma can
be confirmed using spirometry, those whose asthma verification requires an MCT, and those who
have asthma but do not display reversibility or have a positive MCT. To elucidate such potential

differences, we used data from the Economic Burden of Asthma (EBA) study . This longitudinal study
used population-based sampling and followed 622 adult individuals with physician-diagnosed asthma
over one year. Asthma status was verified with one pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and one
MCT (similar to the protocol evaluated in this study). Asthma control was verified during baseline and
each of the three-monthly visits. Using these data, we constructed a generalized linear model (with
multinomial distribution and cumulative logit link) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of having controlled
asthma compared with uncontrolled asthma, as well as having partially controlled asthma compared
with uncontrolled asthma, among the three-aforementioned groups. The exposure was asthma
verification status (response to spirometry, response to MCT, no response to spirometry and MCT).
The model was adjusted for sex, age at baseline, and whether the individual used any controller
medication in the 12 months before the study began (see Online Repository Materials-Section C and
Table 1 – section 1.2 for distribution of asthma control).
22

Modeling asthma treatment

A major benefit of the objective diagnostic verification would be the removal of asthma therapies in
patients who do not need them. We modeled the utilization and short-term effects of inhaled
corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), namely in terms of improving
asthma control and reducing exacerbation rates. We assumed that 51% of diagnosed asthma patients
are on maintenance ICS therapy at any given time , while an additional 5% are on LTRAs . The use of
reliever (rescue) medication was not directly modeled as their costs are embedded within the costs
assigned to each control level, and it was assumed their usage will not have any direct impact on
asthma control. To model the association between the use of controller medications and asthma
control, we used the indirect evidence on the effect of ICS or LTRA use and asthma exacerbations, as
performed in our previous modeling study . We did not include the longer-term adverse events
associated with controller medications, but in a sensitivity analysis modeled the increased risk of
acute pneumonia as an adverse effect of ICS .

Details on the cost parameters are provided in Table 1 – section 1.3. In the base case analysis, costs
included the cost of stepwise asthma verification testing, controller medication costs, direct asthmaattributable costs across levels of control, and direct medical costs resulting from asthma
exacerbations. The costs of spirometry testing and MCT were derived from American Thoracic Society
Coding and Billing Quarterly for hospital-based lung function testing. In the intervention scenario,
we assumed that interpreting the results of spirometry and MCT will each require one additional
based physician visit were derived from the Medical Expenditure
physician visit. The costs of

practitioner and specialist visits as observed in the MEPS data . In a sensitivity analysis, we varied this
costs across the entire range of speciality types to cover scenarios that are based on general
practitioner or specialist management only. Annual per-person direct medical costs of asthma
(including healthcare provider visits, emergency visits, hospitalizations, and medication use) across
levels of control (not including exacerbation costs or costs of controller use, as they were explicitly
modeled) were derived from our previous work . Costs of exacerbations were obtained from the
literature .

All costs were adjusted to 2018 USD ($) using historical inflation rates . In the base case analysis we
excluded indirect costs based on the recommendation of the US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health
and Medicine . In a scenario analysis, we adopted a societal perspective and included costs due to
asthma-related productivity loss (indirect costs). Indirect costs due to sub-optimal asthma control
were derived from multiple sources . These included costs due to total cessation of work as well
as loss of work time. Indirect costs per level of control included loss of productivity due to
exacerbations. We did not include in the base case analysis the costs of work-up required for
alternative diagnoses when asthma diagnosis was reversed. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we
considered the firs-year costs of six common and major alternative diagnoses as reported by Aaron et
al . These costs were derived from a dedicated analysis of 2017 MEPS data (details are provided in
Online Repository Materials - section D).

The health state utility values (utilities) associated with asthma across levels of control were derived
from a study conducted on 2011–2013 US National Health and Wellness Survey . We assigned USspecific general population utilities to individuals whose asthma was ruled out . Utilities associated

Analysis

In the base case analysis, we ran the model separately in the intervention and status quo scenarios
and estimated total discounted costs and QALYs over the 20-year time horizon. We standardized the
results such that they pertain to the outcome of a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 representative
individuals.
Deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of key
parameter values and assumptions on the base case results. In addition, we performed two threshold
analyses, one on the prevalence of asthma overdiagnosis, and another on the first-year diagnostic and
management costs of alternative diagnoses. These analyses identified the critical value of their
respective parameters around which the overall findings on the cost-effectiveness of the intervention
would change. To fully account for uncertainty in all parameters, probabilistic sensitivity analyses
were conducted through Monte Carlo simulations. Uncertainty in each of the underlying parameters
was characterized by assigning a probability distribution to the parameter, and the model was run
10,000 times; within each run a new random value from each distribution was drawn and results were
recalculated. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by using willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds
of$50,000/QALY.
Furthermore, we extrapolated the result to the entire US asthma population, using the general
methodology as described in our recent work estimating the burden of uncontrolled asthma in the
US . In summary, projections of US population by state were derived from the Census Bureau Population Division . The prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma stratified by age and sex was

Results

provides the results of base case analysis for a cohort of 10,000 adults with physiciandiagnosed asthma under the diagnostic verification versus status quo scenarios. In the diagnostic
verification scenario, in 1,500 patients asthma diagnosis will be confirmed through spirometry alone.
Among the 8,500 that will undergo a subsequent MCT, asthma diagnosis will be confirmed in 4,760.
Asthma will be ruled out in the remaining 3,740 patients in whom spirometry and MCT will be
negative. Among these, in 374 the asthma diagnosis will be erroneously reversed. The total costs of
spirometry and MCT in the diagnostic verification scenario will be $2,480,000 and $3,774,000,
respectively.
Table 2

Total patient-years on asthma controller medications will be 62,906 in the diagnostic verification and
98,402 in the status quo scenario. Total savings in medication costs will be $49.85 million. Under the
diagnostic verification scenario, there will be an extra 3,314 patient-years with uncontrolled asthma
compared with the status quo, and as a result there will be 1,595 more exacerbations. Combining
these results, for the diagnostic verification scenario, total discounted costs and QALYs will be
$279.06 million and 105,324, respectively. The corresponding values for the status quo scenario will
be $315.32 million and 101,275. As such, the implementation of the objective asthma verification
algorithm will be associated with $36.26 million reduction in direct costs and a gain of 4,049 in QALYs,
compared with the status quo over the next 20 years.
Sensitivity and scenario analyses

depicts change in incremental costs for different analyses. Diagnostic verification remained
cost-saving in all one-way sensitivity analyses. Table 3 presents the results of scenario analyses. Again,
the overall conclusion remained the same when several alternative assumptions were explored. The
threshold analysis indicated that when the proportion of falsely diagnosed to overall asthma was 6%
or lower (compared with 33% in the main analysis), the diagnostic verification was no longer costFigure 3

saving. As well, the first-year costs of major alternative diagnoses had to be at least 3 times higher
than their original estimates for the diagnostic intervention not to be cost-saving. The inclusion of
indirect costs only slightly reduced the difference in costs between the two strategies, and diagnostic
intervention remained dominant. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis are provided in Figure
4. In >99% of all simulations, the intervention remained dominant.
Extrapolating the results to the entire US population

In 2019, there will be 15.55 million adolescents and adults with asthma in the US; this value will
increase by 13% by 2038. After the implementation of diagnostic verification algorithm, during the
2018–2038 period a diagnosis of asthma will be reversed in 70.29 million individuals. The total
undiscounted cost saving in the intervention scenario versus status quo will be $56.48 billion, and
there will be a cumulative gain in QALYs of 6.14 million (see analysis by year for the entire US
population in Online Repository Materials-Section E and Table E3).
Discussion

Our results indicate that the implementation of a stepwise diagnostic verification algorithm at point
of care among US adults with a self-reported diagnosis of asthma might be associated with significant
savings in costs and improvements in quality of life over twenty years. In the main analysis as well as
the sensitivity and scenario analyses, this strategy was dominant against the strategy of continuing
asthma management; i.e., it was associated with reduced costs and improvements in quality of life.
Extrapolating these results to the entire US population suggested that over 20 years, there could be a
saving of $40.51 billion in direct asthma-related medical costs.
These results are despite the fact that our modeling approach was based on several conservative
assumptions against diagnostic verification. For one, in patients whose asthma is ruled out, the
possible causes of underlying symptoms are more likely to be verified. As such, it is likely that there
will be benefits to patients and reductions in costs due to the proper management of the underlying
disease. In the study by Aaron et al., more than 50% of patients whose asthma was ruled out were
ultimately diagnosed with other conditions. The most common alternative diagnoses were allergic

rhinitis, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, anxiety disorders, acute bronchitis, Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease, and Ischemic heart disease. To some extent, the overall efficiency of the asthma
verification algorithms is influenced by the efficiency of management of these conditions. It is likely
that the additional costs of diagnostic workup and disease management will be offset by better
outcomes and increase in quality of life under proper treatment of such conditions. In a sensitivity
analysis that explored this aspect, asthma verification test remained cost-saving by incorporating the
first-year costs of diagnostic and management of the six most common alternative diagnoses (a
finding that remained valid when the prevalence of such conditions were assumed to be up to three
times higher than their original values).
Further, we assumed that in around 4 % of individuals asthma will be ruled out incorrectly due to the
imperfect sensitivity of spirometry and a single MCT. In such individuals we assumed that controller
medications will be discontinued and as result asthma control status will deteriorate. This results in
reduced quality of life and a higher rate of exacerbations that will last throughout the time horizon of
the study. However, in reality it is likely that the intensification of symptoms and occurrence of
exacerbations upon treatment withdrawal will result in further assessments and a re-establishment of
the diagnosis. When we modeled this aspect in a sensitivity analysis, the diagnostic intervention
scenario was even more cost-saving.
We are aware of one previous economic evaluation of secondary verification of asthma . In the study
by Pakhale et al, which was performed in the Canadian context, implementation of an asthma
verification algorithm was associated with an average cost savings of $35,141 per 100 screened
individuals. The main source of cost saving was medication costs but the authors did not consider the
impact of diagnostic verification and subsequent medication changes on asthma control,
exacerbations, and quality of life.
38

The strengths of our study includes its reliance on hierarchy of evidence in estimating model
parameters, considering multiple sources of evidence about the burden of uncontrolled asthma and
the association between asthma control, treatment, resource use, and quality of life. Nuanced
modeling of asthma control over time and how it is affected by diagnostic verification and changes in
treatments further enhances the generalizability of our results compared with previous evidence. The

incorporation of uncertainty in model inputs and assumptions into the results should provide
reassurance that the overall findings are not materially affected by uncertain evidence.
The limitations of our study should also be acknowledged. The main source of evidence on the rate of
asthma overdiagnosis was a Canadian study . We could not find any US-based study, but a recent
systematic review on this topic reported that studies across different jurisdictions have consistently
reported an overdiagnosis rate between 29%-34% . Our threshold analysis also indicated that
overdiagnosis rate in the US should be implausibly low for the diagnostic verification not to be costsaving. We assumed that diagnostic verification will take place in the context of routine clinical
practice, as such our results do not pertain to alternative schemes such as a systematic screening
program. As well, a strict adherence to the diagnostic verification algorithm might not be achieved in
the real world. For example, if the spirometry fails to establish the diagnosis, the physician might
decide on a trial of medication cessation and re-evaluation of symptom burden before embarking on
the assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness. Such departures from the verification protocol will
inevitably affect the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic verification. Furthermore, in extrapolating the
results to the entire US, we assumed immediate uptake of the diagnostic verification algorithm while
in reality there will be gradual adoption of such a program and imperfect implementation. We did not
consider alternative diagnostic strategies such as using the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide as
the data for such a diagnostic strategy is less robust. Finally, changes in risk factors as well as future
innovations in asthma diagnosis and care can impact the efficiency of the proposed intervention.

There are several opportunities for future research in this area. We evaluated the implementation of
objective diagnostic verification in patients with a previous diagnosis of asthma. Objective diagnostic
testing might also be beneficial in individuals who are suspected of having asthma for the first time.
The cost-effectiveness profile of objective testing for such a population may be different than for
individuals with an existing diagnosis. Further, we did not investigate to what extent individual
characteristics can be used to refine the population for whom diagnostic verification will be
beneficial. For instance, performing a diagnostic workup only among patients whose asthma
diagnoses were not initially made through objective verification might further improve its costeffectiveness. We did not have access to a reliable source of evidence to infer the performance of

diagnostic verification across such subgroups. However, previous objective verification testing should
not necessarily preclude an objective re-evaluation of asthma, due to potentially inaccurate recall of
the initial diagnosis, as well as the fact that asthma may become clinically dormant for extended
periods of time, justifying treatment cessation among individuals in whom reversible airway
obstruction cannot be reproduced.
In summary, our results indicate that secondary diagnostic verification of asthma during routine
clinical encounters among adults with a self-reported asthma diagnosis may be cost-saving and may
improve quality of life of patients. The overall conclusions made in this study about the merits of such
diagnostic verification remained robust against changes in assumptions and parameter values.
Nevertheless, evidence on the performance of diagnostic verification largely comes from research
settings, some of which from countries other than the US. As the ‘real-world’ adherence to, and
performance of, stepwise diagnostic algorithms remain untested, future implementation of such
algorithms should also be coupled with subsequent evaluations.

ICER: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
†In this scenario we investigated increased risk of pneumonia. The probabilities of pneumonia according to ICS exposure were obtained from a recent
systematic review and meta-analysis (23). Pneumonia-related death rate, direct costs of pneumonia and utilities associated with pneumonia were
derived from literature (37-39) see table 1.
‡In this scenario we adopted a societal perspective by including costs due to loss of productivity
§In this Scenario we assumed the Individuals whose asthma will be incorrectly ruled out will be re-diagnosed over time (50% re-diagnosis over 20 years)
due to unresolved symptoms and exacerbations after treatment withdrawal;
)We modeled a general decline in ICS use (from 100% in year one to 60% in year 20) derived from previous reports (13).
#We selected six major alternative diagnoses in patients whose asthma were ruled out See text and Tablw1 for details. We estimated the mean annual
cost of first-time diagnosis for above-mentioned diseases from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data for 2017.
