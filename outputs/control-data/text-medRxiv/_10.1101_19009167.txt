Abstract
Race is an established risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD). We sought to determine
whether the association of electrophysiological (EP) substrate with SCD varies between black
and white individuals. Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study with
analyzable ECGs (n=14,408; age 54±6 y; 74% white) were included. EP substrate was
characterized by traditional 12-lead ECG and vectorcardiographic metrics. Two competing
outcomes were adjudicated SCD and non-sudden cardiac death (nonSCD). Interaction of ECG
metrics with race was studied in Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models,
adjusted for prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk factors, and incident non-fatal CVD.
At the baseline visit linear regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and study center, showed
black individuals had larger Spatial Ventricular Gradient magnitude by 0.30 (95%CI 0.25-0.34)
mV, SAI QRST by 18.4 (13.7-23.0) mV*ms, Cornell voltage by 0.30 (95%CI 0.25-0.35) mV
than white individuals. Over a median follow-up of 24.4 years, SCD incidence was higher in
black (2.86; 95%CI 2.50-3.28 per 1000 person-years) than white individuals (1.37; 95%CI 1.221.53 per 1000 person-years). Black individuals with hypertension had the highest rate of SCD:
4.26; 95%CI 3.66-4.96 per 1000 person-years. Race did not modify associations of EP substrate
with SCD and nonSCD. EP substrate does not explain racial disparities in SCD rate.

Introduction
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) disproportionately affects black individuals, with a nearly twofold increased risk of SCD in black as compared to white individuals.1-3 Socioeconomic
disparities and the burden of cardiovascular (CV) risk have been proposed as factors that may
underlie the observed racial differences in SCD.1 However, adjustment for socioeconomic and
behavioral measures of health does not fully explain an excess of SCD risk in black individuals.1,
2, 4

Moreover, the large prospective community-based cohort the Atherosclerosis Risk in

Communities (ARIC) study showed that race modifies an association of several major risk
factors with SCD. Prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD) and body mass index (BMI) carried
greater risk of SCD in white as compared to black individuals.1 In contrast, hypertension carried
significantly larger risk of SCD in black as compared to white individuals.1 The mechanisms
behind these observed interactions remain unclear but pose the question of differences in EP
substrate metrics between the two racial groups.
A conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) characterizes global electrophysiological
(EP) substrate of SCD,5 which can be assessed by traditional [QRS duration, QTc interval, ECGleft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)] and novel metrics, such as global electrical heterogeneity
(GEH).6, 7 GEH is measured by spatial QRS-T angle, magnitude and direction (elevation and
azimuth) of the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) vector, and its scalar value sum absolute
QRST integral (SAI QRST). The addition of GEH to known CV risk factors improves
reclassification of SCD.8 The SVG vector describes the magnitude and direction of the steepest
gradient between the areas of the heart with the longest and the shortest total recovery time.9-11
The SVG is related to global heterogeneity of action potential duration and morphology12, 13
through the heart. While racial differences in ECG-LVH diagnostic criteria are recognized14, it is

unknown whether there are racial differences in association between EP substrate and risk of
SCD.
The self-identified race is a social construct. Recently, the Public Health Critical Race
Praxis15 was developed as a theoretical framework for studies of racial disparities. Our goal was
to apply the Public Health Critical Race Praxis15 approach to the epidemiological study of SCD
substrate. We hypothesized that (1) there are racial differences in global ECG measures of EP
substrate, and (2) self-identified race modifies the association of EP substrate with SCD.
Methods
The ARIC Study data are available through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s
Biological Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC)16 and
the National Center of Biotechnology Information’s database of Genotypes and Phenotypes
(dbGaP).17
Study population
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study recruited 15,792 participants (age
45-64 y) in 1987-1989. All participants underwent standardized examinations.18 In this study, we
included ARIC cohort participants with recorded resting 12-lead ECG and measured global
electrical heterogeneity (GEH)8; n=15,777. We excluded participants who self-identified
themselves as non-white or non-black race (n=48), or as black at the Washington County, and
Minneapolis field centers (n=55), those with missing covariates (n=1,220), outcome (n=1), and
non-sinus median beat (n=45). The final sample of participants with normal sinus median beat
included 14,408 participants.

Exposures of race and electrocardiographic global electrical heterogeneity
The race was self-reported. We analyzed resting 12-lead ECGs of the first five study visits.
Visit 1 was conducted in 1987-1989, visit 2 in 1990-1992, visit 3 in 1993-1995, visit 4 in 19961998, and visit 5 in 2011-2013. Traditional ECG amplitudes and intervals were measured by the
12 SL algorithm as implemented in the Magellan ECG Research Workstation V2 (GE Marquette
Electronics, Milwaukee, WI), and Cornell voltage was calculated.
GEH was measured by spatial QRS-T angle, SVG magnitude, azimuth, and elevation, and
SAI QRST.19 Both area and peak SVG vectors and QRS-T angles were measured.19 We used
normal sinus time-coherent median beat with identified isoelectric heart vector origin point.20
The MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) open-source software code for GEH
measurement and the heart vector origin definition is provided at
https://physionet.org/physiotools/geh and https://github.com/Tereshchenkolab/Origin.
Primary outcome: sudden cardiac death
Follow-up of ARIC participants21 and determination of SCD has been described in prior
reports.22 SCD, the primary study outcome, was defined as a sudden pulseless condition in a
previously stable participant without a non‐cardiac cause of arrest if it occurred outside of the
hospital or in the emergency department. It was classified as definite, probable, or possible based
on physician-adjudication.
Competing mortality outcome: non-sudden cardiac death
Competing non-sudden cardiac death (nonSCD) was defined as an SCD exclusion, a
composite of fatal CHD, heart failure (HF) death, death in a participant with baseline HF, or
incident hospitalized HF. Fatal CHD cases were adjudicated by the ARIC Morbidity and
Mortality Classification Committee.21, 23 Baseline prevalent HF was based on Gothenburg

criteria (stage 3 symptomatic HF with both cardiac and pulmonary symptoms and current
medical treatment24), or self-reported use of HF medication. Incident HF was defined as presence
of HF codes in a death certificate or an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9)
discharge code, as previously described.25 All other deaths were included in the noncardiac death
outcome.
Baseline clinical characteristics
Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5
to <25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0 to <30.0 kg/m2) or obese (≥30.0 kg/m2). Hypertension was
defined as blood pressure (BP) of ≥140/90 mm Hg, or self-reported antihypertensive medications
at visit 1. Diabetes was defined as nonfasting blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, fasting blood glucose
≥126 mg/dL, self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes, or self-reported medications for
diabetes or high blood sugar at visit 1. Stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were based on
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the CKD Epidemiology
Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI).26 Participants were classified into stage 1 CKD (eGFRCKD-EPI
≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2), stage 2 CKD (eGFRCKD-EPI 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2), Stage 3 CKD
(eGFRCKD-EPI 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), stage 4 CKD (eGFRCKD-EPI 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73
m2), and stage 5 CKD (eGFRCKD-EPI <15 mL/min/1.73 m2) or established kidney failure. Baseline
serum electrolytes concentrations were measured in the central laboratory.
Prevalent stroke was based on a previously reported stroke and transient ischemic attack
diagnostic algorithm27. Prevalent CHD included a self-reported physician diagnosis of
myocardial infarction (MI), baseline ECG evidence of MI by the Minnesota code28, or a history
of coronary revascularization (either via coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous
coronary intervention). The use of antiarrhythmic drugs included self-reported and validated by

medications inventory use of class I, II (beta-blockers), III, IV (phenylalkylamines, and
benzothiazepines calcium channel blockers), or V (digoxin) antiarrhythmic agents.
Socioeconomic factors
Socioeconomic status was assessed during a home interview at visit 1. Total combined
family income for the past 12 months (in 1987-1989 values) was self-reported in one of the
following categories: under $5,000; $5,000-$7,999; $8,000-$11,999; $12,000-$15,999; $16,000$24,999; $25,000-$34,999; $35,999-$49,999; over $50,000, or not reported. Lifetime
educational level was defined as the highest grade or year of school completed. The most recent
occupation was recorded in one of the following categories: (1) Managerial and Professional
Specialty Occupations; (2) Technical, Sales, and Administrative Support Occupations; (3)
Service Occupations; (4) Farming, Forestry, and Fishing Occupations; (5) Precision Production,
Craft, and Repair Occupations; (6) Operators, Fabricators, and Laborers; (7) Homemakers; (8)
Retired; (9) Others.
Baseline physical activity was measured at work, in sport, and during leisure time, using the
modified Baecke questionnaire29, which defined semicontinuous indices ranging from 1 (low) to
5 (high). Current cigarette smoking and consumption of alcoholic beverages was used as selfreported at visit 1. Self-reported health insurance status was ascertained at visit 1.
Incident non-fatal cardiovascular events
Incident non-fatal CV events included atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, CHD, and HF. Incident
AF included AF detected on follow-up 12-lead ECG or hospital discharge records (ICD-9 code
427.3).30 Physician-adjudicated definite or probable incident strokes were included.31 Incident
CHD was physician-adjudicated and included definite or probable MI or a coronary
revascularization procedure.21, 23 Incident HF was defined above.25

Statistical analyses
Cross-sectional analyses of visit 1 data
To investigate differences in global ECG metrics between black and white individuals, we
performed cross-sectional linear regression analyses using visit 1 data. Model 1 was adjusted for
age, sex, and study center. To determine whether racial differences in GEH could be explained
by racial disparities, including differences in socioeconomic, traditional and novel clinical risk
factors, Model 2 was additionally adjusted for prevalent cardiovascular (CV) disease (HF, CHD,
stroke), known CV risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, current smoking and alcohol intake,
work, sport, and leisure physical activity levels, levels of total cholesterol, high density
lipoprotein, and triglycerides, BMI), use of antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic medications,
serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and uric acid,
total protein and albumin, blood urea nitrogen, CKD stage classified by eGFRCKD-EPI, traditional
ECG characteristics (mean heart rate, QRS duration, Bazett-corrected QT interval, Cornell
voltage), and socioeconomic factors (education level, occupation category, income, health
insurance).
Analysis of circular variables
Circular variables were analyzed as previously described.32 SVG azimuth was transformed
by doubling its value and then adding 360º.33
Survival analyses
We built Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risks models. The proportionalhazards assumption was verified using stcox PH-assumptions suite of tests implemented in
STATA (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) for all predictors of interest in most models.
Exceptions were stated. To standardize comparisons, all continuous ECG variables were

expressed as by their z-score. To adjust for confounders, we constructed two models, performed
a statistical test for interaction with race in each model, and constructed race-stratified models
for white and black individuals. Relative hazard ratio (RHR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI)
of SCD risk for black relative to white individuals was reported, assuming HR for white
individuals is a reference.
Model 1 was adjusted for demographic characteristics (age, sex, and study center), prevalent
CV disease (HF, CHD, stroke), baseline CV risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, levels of total
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, BMI, use of antihypertensive and
antiarrhythmic medications, serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,
phosphorus, and uric acid, total protein and albumin, blood urea nitrogen, CKD stage classified
by eGFRCKD-EPI,), and measured at visit 1 socioeconomic factors (smoking and alcohol intake,
work, sport, and leisure physical activity levels, education level, occupation category, income,
health insurance). Time-updated model 2 included time-updated ECG predictors (one-by-one),
all baseline covariates included in model 1, and time-updated incident nonfatal CV events (AF,
HF, CHD, and stroke). Race-stratified associations of continuous ECG variables with SCD were
also studied using adjusted (model 1) Cox regression models incorporating cubic splines with 4
knots.
To compare competing risks of SCD and nonSCD, we constructed two Fine and Gray’s
competing risks models34 for SCD and nonSCD outcomes, using the same covariates as in Cox
models. We calculated the relative sub-hazard ratio (RSHR) with 95% CI of SCD risk for black
relative to white individuals, assuming SHR for white participant is a reference.
Based on a recent study demonstrating a significantly stronger association of hypertension
with SCD in black as compared to white individuals,1 we additionally constructed a set of

models that included interaction with both race and hypertension categories. The white
hypertension-free subgroup was the reference.
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA MP 16.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX). Considering the many multivariate analyses performed, statistical significance at the 0.05
level should be interpreted cautiously.
Results
Study population
Black study participants (Table 1) were slightly younger, with a higher prevalence of HF,
stroke, and major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking) than white individuals. White
participants had a higher prevalence of CHD, higher level of triglycerides, were less physically
active at work, but more physically active at leisure and sport than black participants. There were
large disparities between races in access to healthcare, income, education, and occupation.
Differences in ECG metrics between black and white participants
SVG magnitude, SAI QRST, and Cornell voltage were significantly larger in black than
white individuals, even after adjustment for confounders (Table 2 and Figure 1). The spatial
QRS-T angle and direction of SVG, as well as QTc were similar in white and black individuals
(Supplemental Figure 1).
Association of EP substrate with sudden cardiac death in black and white participants
Over a median follow-up of 24.4 years, there were 522 SCDs (incidence 1.74; 95% CI 1.591.89 per 1000 person-years) and 2,147 nonSCDs (incidence 7.14; 95% CI 6.85-7.45 per 1000
person-years). SCD incidence was two times higher in black (2.86; 95%CI 2.50-3.28 per 1000
person-years) than white participants (1.37; 95%CI 1.22-1.53 per 1000 person-years). Incidence

of nonSCD was higher in black (9.60; 95%CI 8.92-10.33 per 1000 person-years) than white
participants (6.33; 95%CI 6.01-6.67 per 1000 person-years).
All traditional ECG metrics, SVG direction, and SAI QRST were associated with a similar
risk of SCD in black and white individuals, a finding that was consistent both in Cox regression
(Supplemental Table 1A) and competing risk models (Supplemental Table 2A).
Time-updated Cox regression model 2 revealed significant interaction with SVG magnitude.
However, competing risk analysis found no effect modification by race of SVG magnitude –
SCD association (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 2). Continuous hazard functions looked
similarly for white and black individuals (Supplemental Figure 2), suggesting an absence of
meaningful effect modification.
Race did not modify associations of ECG measures with nonSCD (Supplemental Table 2).
Race and hypertension modify an association of spatial QRS-T angle with SCD
The lowest SCD incidence was observed in hypertension-free white (0.95; 95%CI 0.82-1.11
per 1000 person-years), followed by hypertension-free black (1.31; 95%CI 0.98-1.75 per 1000
person-years), and then by white individuals with hypertension (2.59; 95%CI 2.20-3.04 per 1000
person-years). Black individuals with hypertension had the highest rate of SCD: 4.26; 95%CI
3.66-4.96 per 1000 person-years.
Race significantly modified an association of spatial QRS-T angle with SCD, both in Cox
regression (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 1A) and competing risk models (Figure 2 and
Supplemental Table 2A). In white individuals, the spatial QRS-T angle was associated with
approximately 20% greater risk of SCD than in black individuals. Adjustment for incident
nonfatal CVD in Cox model 2 attenuated the effect modification (Figure 2). In race-stratified
Cox regression (Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 1B) and competing risk models 1 and 2

(Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 2B), spatial QRS-T angle was associated with SCD in white,
but not black individuals (Figure 5).
Further analysis of the interaction with both race and hypertension showed that spatial QRST angle was associated with SCD similarly in white and hypertension-free black individuals
(Figure 6 and Supplemental Table 3), but not in black individuals with hypertension. Effect
modification by race and hypertension remained significant after adjustment for incident CV
events in both Cox regression and competing risk models.
Discussion
This large, prospective community-based cohort study of more than 14,000 participants
showed several important findings. Apart from the QRS-T angle, the association of EP substrate
with SCD was similar in black and white individuals. In this study, race did not modify an
association of EP substrate with SCD, supporting the recognition of race as a product of social
practices, but not an inherent characteristic of individuals. Similar strength of the association of
global ECG metrics with SCD in black and white individuals implies that EP substrate does not
explain racial disparities in SCD rate.
Furthermore, we observed that black individuals with hypertension experienced 4.5-fold
higher SCD incidence than hypertension-free white individuals. Black race in the presence of
hypertension is associated with very high SCD risk regardless of QRS-T angle, which explains
the weaker association of QRS-T angle with SCD in black than white individuals. However,
relative risk of SCD carried by QRS-T angle did not differ in hypertension-free black and white
individuals with or without hypertension. We also observed that black individuals had larger
amplitude-based ECG metrics (SAI QRST, SVG magnitude, Cornell voltage) as compared to

white individuals. The difference of approximately 0.3 mV was robustly observed even after
accounting for socioeconomic status and other confounders. This finding is consistent with
previous studies35, 36 and supports use of race-specific thresholds for abnormal SAI QRST,8 SVG
magnitude,8 and ECG-LVH.14, 37
Race does not modify an association of EP substrate with SCD
Our study found that all traditional ECG metrics (QTc duration, QRS duration, and Cornell
voltage), SVG direction, and SAI QRST were associated with a similar risk of SCD among black
and white individuals. There is little existing literature studying the association of ECG metrics
and risk of SCD by race, and this study provides new insight into racial differences and
similarities. In a prior study on sex differences,32 we found that Cornell voltage, SVG magnitude,
and SAI QRST are associated with a 16-24% greater risk of SCD in women as compared to men.
Sex is biologically determined and therefore may cause differences in EP substrate in contrast to
race, which is a complex social construct.
There has been growing recognition of the Critical Race Theory38, which aims to better
account for the effects of institutionalized racism on health. Critical Race Theory aims to
acknowledge inequities in the biomedical field and bring to light both discrimination and health
consequences that result from discrimination and inequalities in access to healthcare. Race is a
product of social processes of power. The Critical Race Theory defines race not as an inherent
characteristic of a person, but as a product of social practices.38 Results of our study support the
Critical Race Theory postulate. Many previous studies recognized race as an independent and
strong risk factor of SCD even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors but attributed it - at least
partially – to underlying biological differences between black and white individuals.1, 2, 4 In
contrast, our comprehensive study of EP substrate did not find meaningful effect modification by

race. Results of our study call attention to structural racism as an important determinant of the
increased SCD rate in black as compared to white individuals.39
A number of studies investigated the effects of racism on physical health. These studies
showed that self-reported daily discrimination and stress was associated with increased waist
circumference, increased waist to hip ratio, and higher fasting glucose level.40-42 Not only does
daily stress increase potential risk factors for SCD, but long-term negative emotions also increase
vulnerability to life-threatening arrhythmias43 and can potentially contribute to racial disparities
in SCD.
When thinking about race and potential biological differences determining health, it is
important to consider that race is not equivalent to genetic ancestry, but as mentioned above is a
social construct. In our study, participants self-identified as black or white, but no ancestry
information was analyzed. Ancestry analyses of the self-reported racial and ethnic identity in the
US have shown that self-identified black individuals carry up to 24% of European ancestry, and
about 1 in 10 self-identified white individuals in the US South have at least 1% of African
ancestry.44 Association of genetic ancestry with EP substrate of SCD4 deserves separate
investigation.
Clinical implications for the finding of no meaningful effect modification by race suggests
that there is no need for race-specific risk stratification of SCD. Instead, race should be included
in the SCD risk models as a potent risk marker.8
Race-specific thresholds of ECG voltage measurements
Racial differences in ECG voltage and ECG-LVH definition have been previously
reported.35-37 This study showed consistent results: voltage-based ECG metrics (SVG magnitude,
SAI QRST, Cornell voltage) were larger in black than white individuals, by 0.2-0.3 mV.

Comprehensive adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors in this study did not affect the racial
differences in SVG magnitude, SAI QRST, and Cornell voltage. Similarly, the Dallas Heart
Study reported45 that after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and body composition, both
black race and African ancestry were associated with approximately 0.25 mV larger ECG
voltage. Of note, in our study, racial differences in SVG magnitude, SAI QRST, and Cornell
voltage did not translate into different strengths of their associations with SCD.
A recent genome-wide association study of GEH revealed 10 GEH-associated loci.46 Four
loci (11p11.2 cluster, near ACTB, LUZP1-KDM1A, and IGF1R) were associated with increase in
both SAI QRST and SVG magnitude. IGF1R is a key signaling step in physiologic
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy47, which can potentially explain why increased SAI QRST, SVG
magnitude, and Cornell voltage in black individuals did not translate into stronger association of
these ECG measures with SCD. SAI QRST – associated locus near LUZP1-KDM1A has higher
effect allele frequency46 in African ancestry (0.92) as compared to European ancestry (0.59),
which can potentially contribute to larger SAI QRST in a black population. Further studies are
needed to test these hypotheses.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of our study included the sizeable community-dwelling cohort, the extended
follow-up, and the rigorous adjudication of SCD. We were also able to adjust for time-varying
ECG measurements and incident nonfatal cardiovascular events and conduct competing risk
analyses. However, our study has limitations, as previously acknowledged.8 While efforts were
made to differentiate SCD from nonSCD, it is possible than some SCD events were secondary to
sudden non-cardiac catastrophy as opposed to ventricular arrhythmias. However, these events
likely compromise a small fraction of SCD events and therefore should not significantly affect

study results. This study did not include resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to
difficulty accurately differentiating its cause. Another important consideration is the inclusion of
only black and white individuals, which limits generalizability to the multiethnic populations.
Further studies in other races and ethnicities are needed to validate our findings.

in white participants are at 22 – 48 – 69 – 112 degrees, and in black participants are at 21 – 48 –
69 - 118 degrees.
Figure 6. Adjusted (model 1) risk of SCD associated with area and peak QRS-T angle in
black participants with and without hypertension. Restricted cubic spline with 95% CI shows a
change in hazard ratio (Y-axis) in response to QRS-T angle change (X-axis). 50th percentile of
QRS-T angle is selected as reference. Knots of peak QRS-T angle are at 10 – 29 – 45 - 120
degrees. Knots of area QRS-T angle in black participants with hypertension are at 21 – 50– 72 130 degrees, and in hypertension – free black participants are at 20 – 46 – 66 - 103 degrees.

Supplemental Figure Legends:
Supplemental Figure 1: Estimated adjusted marginal (least-squares) means and 95%
Confidence Intervals of (A) area QRS-T angle, (B) peak QRS-T angle, (C) area SVG azimuth,
(D) peak SVG azimuth, (E) area SVG elevation, (F) peak SVG elevation, (G) QRS duration, (H)
QTc interval for white and black participants. Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, and study
center. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for HF, CHD, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, current
smoking and alcohol intake, work, sport, and leisure physical activity levels, levels of total
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, BMI, use of antihypertensive and
antiarrhythmic medications, serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,
phosphorus, and uric acid, total protein and albumin, blood urea nitrogen, and CKD stage
classified by eGFRCKD-EPI, heart rate, QRS duration, Bazett-corrected QT interval, Cornell
voltage, education level, occupation category, income, and health insurance.
Supplemental Figure 2: Adjusted (model 1) risk of SCD associated with an area (A) and
peak (B) SVG magnitude in black and white participants. Restricted cubic spline with 95% CI
shows change in hazard ratio (Y-axis) in response to SVG magnitude change (X-axis). 50th
percentile of SVG magnitude is selected as reference. Knots of area SVG magnitude in black
participants are at 1.2 – 1.7 – 2.1 – 2.9 mV, and in white participants are at 1.0 – 1.4 – 1.8 – 2.4
mV. Knots of peak SVG magnitude in black participants are at 1.1 – 1.6 – 2.0 – 2.6 mV, and in
white participants are at 0.9 – 1.4 – 1.7 – 2.2 mV.
