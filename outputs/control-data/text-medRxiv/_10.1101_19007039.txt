Abstract

35

One way to address the current crisis in opioid use is to improve our understanding of the

36

biological mechanisms of opioid use disorder (OUD). We completed a primary GWAS of

37

electronic health record-defined OUD in European-ancestry participants in the Million Veteran

38

Program (MVP) sample, which included 8,529 affected subjects and 71,200 opioid-exposed

39

controls. In the MVP alone, there were no genome-wide significant (GWS) associations. We

40

then subjected the MVP and additional OUD GWAS results from the Yale-Penn and SAGE

41

samples to meta-analysis (in total, 10,544 OUD cases and 72,163 opioid-exposed controls). A

42

functional coding variant (rs1799971, encoding Asn40Asp) in OPRM1 (mu opioid receptor gene,

43

the main biological target for opioid drugs) reached GWS (p=1.51×10-8); then replicated in two

44

independent samples (each at p<0.05). The final meta-analyzed p-value for this variant in all

45

samples was 7.81×10-10. SNP-based heritability of OUD was 11.3%. OUD was genetically

46

correlated with 83 traits, including multiple substance use traits, psychiatric illnesses, cognitive

47

performance, and others. Mendelian Randomization revealed possible causal effects on OUD

48

risk from tobacco smoking, major depression, neuroticism, and cognitive performance. Despite

49

the inclusion of data from the MVP, discovery of a significant association depended on including

50

other purpose-collected samples as well. Recruitment of additional opioid dependent subjects

51

for future studies – especially of non-European ancestry – is a crucial next step.

Introduction

53

Opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose are at epidemic levels in the United States. Opioids are

54

the leading cause of overdose deaths, and their use has increased dramatically in recent

55

decades [1]. A multifaceted approach is needed to address the opioid crisis, including improving

56

our understanding of the biological mechanisms of opioid addiction. Opioids exert their

57

biological effects primarily by binding (mainly in brain and peripheral nervous tissues) to the

58

opioid receptors mu (μ), kappa (κ), and delta (δ), which are encoded by OPRM1, OPRK1, and

59

OPRD1, respectively [2]. Numerous candidate-gene association studies of these genes

60

(especially OPRM1) and those encoding related proteins have been conducted in the past two

61

decades (reviewed in ref [3, 4]), but prior studies have failed consistently to demonstrate

62

association (e.g., studies on OPRM1*rs1799971 are reviewed in ref [5]). However, a prior

63

genome-wide association study (GWAS) of opioid dosing reported a genome-wide significant

64

(GWS) association mapping upstream of the OPRM1 locus [6].

65

Rs1799971 (A118G, encoding Asn40Asp) [5, 7], a functional variant, is one of the most

66

studied candidate variants for substance use traits. While no consistent results were observed,

67

this could reflect limited power and population heterogeneity of previous studies (allele

68

frequency varies greatly in different populations [8, 9]). Several kinds of evidence support

69

possible functional effects of this SNP: rs1799971 reportedly alters beta-endorphin binding and

70

activity [7], may be associated with cortisol response to naloxone blockade [10], and may be

71

associated with neurobehavioral functions in a mouse model [11, 12] and human induced

72

pluripotent stem cell lines [13].

73

Several GWAS of DSM-IV opioid dependence [OD] yielded significant findings [14-16];

74

one included internal replication [16] but none reported clear external replication, probably due

75

to the limited sample sizes available (the largest study so far included 2,015 OD cases [16]).

76

The risk variants identified map to APBB2, PARVA, KCNC1, and KCNC2 [14] in African3

77

American (AA) samples, and CNIH3 [15] and RGMA [16] in European ancestry samples. There

78

have also been GWAS of related traits including therapeutic opioid dose (noted above) [6], and

79

opioid overdose (which identified one variant near MCOLN1 in AAs) [17]. Of these, only the

80

study on opioid dosing included an external validation. No GWAS yet has been sufficiently

81

powered to estimate the SNP-based heritability (h2) of OD.

82

We conducted GWAS on ICD (International Classification of Diseases)–9/10-diagnosed

83

opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid-exposed controls) in 79,729 European Americans (EAs)

84

from the Million Veteran Program (MVP). Then we meta-analyzed for OUD combining MVP,

85

Yale-Penn, and the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) samples [18]. The

86

latter two samples were included in our previous publication [16], but were reanalyzed here as a

87

binary diagnostic trait rather than a criterion count for better congruence with available MVP

88

information. Rs1799971 was the only variant that was GWS (p=1.51×10-8) in this meta-analysis.

89

We then replicated the result in two independent samples. We estimated the h2 and detected

90

genetic correlations between OUD and a variety of psychiatric traits. Causal effects of

91

substance use, psychiatric diseases, and educational attainment on liability to OUD were also

92

detected.

Methods

95

MVP datasets. The MVP is a cross-sectional mega-biobank supported by the U.S. Department

96

of Veterans Affairs (VA). Enrollment in MVP began in 2011 and is ongoing. Phenotypic data

97

were collected using the VA electronic health record (EHR), and blood samples were obtained

98

for genetic studies [19]. Two phases of genotypic data have been released according to their

99

genotyping epochs and were included in this study. MVP phase1 contains 353,948 subjects, of

100

whom 209,020 were defined previously as EAs [20]. MVP phase2 contains 108,416 subjects.

101

We used the same process as in MVP phase1 for quality control and to define EAs (see

102

Supplementary Methods) [20]; there were 67,268 EA subjects.

103

Cases were participants with at least one inpatient or two outpatient ICD-9/10 codes for

104

OUD (Supplementary Table 1) between 2000 and 2018. In MVP phase1, there were 6,367 OUD

105

EAs (3.04% prevalence), and 2,162 OUD EAs (3.21% prevalence) in MVP phase2 were

106

included in this study. Stringent criteria were applied to define incident opioid-exposed controls

107

(see details in ref [21]). In short, we started with all MVP participants and excluded subjects with

108

exposure to a prescription opioid <7 consecutive days, or with VA follow-up less than 6 months

109

after baseline, or with cancer diagnosed before or after baseline, or with baseline opioid

110

dosage >90 mg morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), or with OUD diagnosis or OUD

111

treatment at baseline. For the remaining participants, a latent growth mixture model was applied

112

to identify the major classes of opioid dose (measured by MEDD) trajectories that assigned

113

each individual to the trajectory with the highest probability of membership. Four resultant

114

MEDD trajectories were designated as low, moderate, escalating, and rapidly escalating. To

115

minimize the potential rate of false negatives in the control group, subjects assigned to the low-

116

dose trajectory without an incident OUD diagnosis during follow-up were defined as controls,

117

yielding 55,429 and 15,771 EA controls in MVP phaes1 and MVP phase2, respectively.

118

Genotyping in MVP was performed using a customized Affymetrix Biobank Array.

119

Imputation and quality control metrics for MVP phase1 were as described previously [20].

120

Similar processes were used for MVP phase2 (see Supplementary Methods). GWAS was then

121

performed on the MVP datasets. We used logistic regression implemented in PLINK v1.90b4.4

122

[22] for the OUD GWAS correcting for age, sex, and the first 10 principal components (PCs).

138

The calculated effective sample sizes in MVP were used in meta-analyses and all downstream

analyses. Only variants present at least in MVP phase1, which is the largest sample (~75% of

140

the total), and with heterogeneity test p-value >5×10-8 were retained, leaving 5.7 M variants.

142

Replication in independent samples. In Yale-Penn, 4,817 subjects were recently added and

143

not included in any prior analysis. We genotyped them using the Illumina Multi-Ethnic

144

Genotyping Array (San Diego, CA) which includes ~1.7 M SNPs. Subjects with mismatched

145

genotypic and phenotypic sex were removed, as were subjects with excessive heterozygosity.

146

Duplicate subjects with respect to the Yale-Penn discovery samples were removed. The

147

remaining subjects were classified into population groups as for MVP. Among the 2,041

148

genetically classified EAs, 508 were diagnosed as DSM-IV OD cases, and 206 were opioid

149

exposed controls. GEMMA was used for an association test only for rs1799971 (i.e., no other

150

markers were evaluated) and corrected for age, sex, and the first 10 PCs.

151

In the UK Biobank (UKB), we looked up the association between rs1799971 (only this

152

marker, as for the other replication sample) and buprenorphine treatment (mostly used to treat

153

OUD; treatment/medication code: 20003_1140871732) in the UKB. We examined GWAS

154

summary data released by the Neale lab (information available at http://www.nealelab.is/uk-

155

biobank) for 240 cases and 360,901 controls differentiated based on buprenorphine treatment.

157

SNP-based h2. LD Score Regression (LDSC) [24] was used to estimate the SNP-based h2

158

using 1000 Genomes Project Europeans [8] as the LD reference panel. The major

159

histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (chr6: 26–34Mb) was excluded. Effective sample size

160

was used in LDSC.

161
162

Genetic correlation. We estimated the genetic correlation (rg) between OUD and 715 publicly

163

available traits from LD Hub [25] or other resources using LDSC (Supplementary Table 2) [26].

164

Among the tested traits, 232 were published previously, and 483 from the UKB were

165

unpublished, but integrated in LD Hub. Bonferroni correction was applied and correlation was

166

considered significant at a p-value threshold of 6.99×10-5.

168

Mendelian Randomization. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate whether

exposures (based on 18 published traits that were significantly correlated with OUD [rg

170

p<6.99×10-5]) have causal effects on the liability to OUD. For instrumental variants missing in

171

the OUD summary data, we used the results of the best proxy variant in highest LD (r2>0.8) with

172

the missing variant. If the MAF of the missing variant was <0.01, or none of the variants within

173

200 kb had LD r2>0.8, we removed the instrumental variant from the analysis. Palindromic

174

SNPs (A/T or G/C alleles) with MAF [0.4, 0.5] in the OUD summary data were also removed or

175

replaced with the best proxy variant. For robust causal effect inference, we limited the traits

176

studied to those with >30 available instruments. Accordingly, 12 exposures were analyzed. We

177

used weighted median [27], inverse-variance weighted (IVW, random-effects model) [28], and

178

MR-Egger [29], implemented in the R package “MendelianRandomization v0.3.0” [30] for MR

179

inference. Evidence of pleiotropic effects was examined by the MR-Egger intercept test, where

180

a non-zero intercept (p<0.05) indicates directional pleiotropy [29]. Whereas MR analyses

181

require the beta (effect size) and standard error, we calculated these using Z-scores (z), allele

182

frequency (p) and sample size (n) from the OUD meta-analyses [31]:

individuals, Table 1), and no variant reached GWS (p<5×10-8, Supplementary Figure 1). The

Replication in independent samples

215

In total, 714 EAs (508 OD cases and 206 opioid-exposed controls) were analyzed in the new

216

Yale-Penn samples, and rs1799971*G was associated with reduced OD risk (i.e., in the same

217

direction as the discovery meta-analysis) (beta=-0.074, se=-0.038, p=0.049). In the UKB,

218

rs1799971*G was negatively associated with buprenorphine treatment status (240 cases and

219

360,901 controls, beta=-1.90×10-4, se=9.13×10-5, p=0.038), also consistent with the direction of

effect in the discovery sample. Meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohorts for this variant

yielded a p-value of 7.81×10-10.

Genetic correlations with other traits

226

unpublished and derived from UKB data. OUD was significantly correlated with 83 of these traits

227

(Supplementary Table 2). Figure 1 depicts 18 correlated traits from published literature

228

(Supplementary Methods). Among the correlated substance use-related traits, “ever smoked

229

regularly” showed the highest correlation with OUD (rg=0.51, se=0.06, p=3.37×10-19), followed

230

by “opioid medication use” in UKB (rg=0.48, se=0.07, p=1.61×10-11). Both “problematic alcohol

231

use” (measured by alcohol dependence and AUDIT-P [Alcohol Use Disorders Identification

232

Test–Problems] score) and “alcohol use quantity” (measured by drinks per week) showed high

233

genetic correlations with OUD. “Unable to stop smoking” (current vs. former smoker), and

234

“earlier age of smoking initiation” were also correlated with OUD. However, correlations with

235

AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption), total AUDIT, cigarettes per

236

day, and lifetime cannabis use were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Several

237

psychiatric traits were correlated with OUD, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

238

(ADHD, rg=0.36, se=0.07, p=6.78×10-7), major depressive disorder (MDD, rg=0.35, se=0.06,

239

p=1.62×10-10), schizophrenia (rg=0.29, se=0.05, p=1.93×10-8), neuroticism (rg=0.27, se=0.05,

240

p=8.65×10-8), and neuroticism subclusters. OUD was positively correlated with risk-taking

241

behavior and insomnia, and negatively correlated with cognitive traits and age of first birth.

242

These finding are consistent with the known adverse medical, psychiatric, and social

243

consequences of OUD.

Mendelian Randomization

254

Using MR, we explored possible causal effects of exposures on OUD (Table 2). Among the 12

255

tested exposures, five supported a possible causal effect on liability to OUD by at least one

256

method and without evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (MR-Egger intercept p>0.05): positively

257

with ever smoked regularly, MDD, neuroticism and worry neuroticism subcluster, and negatively

258

with educational attainment. There was weak evidence of a causal effect of drinks per week on

259

OUD risk by the IVW method, but the estimate could be biased due to horizontal pleiotropy.

Discussion

267

Opioid use is at epidemic levels in the United States and is a major cause of death and disability

268

worldwide. Understanding the genetic architecture of OUD might provide clinically useful clues

269

about its biology. However, only a few risk variants have been identified by GWAS so far, and

270

none has had clear external replication. Several factors contribute to this situation: 1). OUD is a

271

complex psychiatric disease with relatively low heritability, and there is no single variant with

272

large effect size that can be detected in small cohorts (contrary to, for example, alcohol

273

dependence [32] with ADH1B, and nicotine dependence with the chromosome 15 nicotine

274

receptor cluster [33]); 2). Previous OUD GWAS were relatively small compared to those for

275

legal substance use disorders (e.g., the number of alcohol use disorder cases reached 57,564

276

in a large meta-analysis [34]); 3). In published work relevant to opioid use, there was

277

considerable phenotypic heterogeneity across samples. The ascertainment of OUD cases (e.g.,

278

ICD-diagnosed OUD in the EHR, DSM-IV-assessed OD, patients receiving opioid substitution

279

therapy, and daily injectors of illicit opioids) and controls (e.g., opioid exposed, or random

280

population with unknown opioid exposure status) differ by study. One way to reach a better

281

understanding of OUD genetics is increasing the sample size in a homogeneous cohort.

282

We conducted GWAS of OUD in a large cohort, the MVP, comprising 8,529 cases and

283

71,200 opioid-exposed controls of European ancestry. Most previously reported variants

284

associated with a wide range of opioid-related traits were not significant in MVP (cf. summary

285

statistics). For some, this reflects lack of marker information or LD proxies in the MVP, or the

286

lack of non-European populations in this analysis; some associations were previously reported

287

in African-ancestry populations only [14]; others were reported in EAs, but relevant variants are

288

missing in the MVP data (e.g., rs12442183 near RGMA reported by Cheng et al. [16] was

289

filtered by low genotype call rate in imputation). No variant reached GWS in this largest-ever

290

cohort individually; OPRM1*rs1799971 was nominally significantly associated with OUD

291

(p=5.90×10-8). We meta-analyzed MVP samples with Yale-Penn and SAGE (re-analyzed here

292

as case/control rather than the quantitative criterion count traits reported originally, to match the

293

available phenotype from the MVP more closely), increasing total sample size to 82,707 (10,544

294

cases and 72,163 opioid-exposed controls). By adding four samples from Yale-Penn and

295

SAGE, rs1799971 reached GWS. The final meta-analyzed p-value for this marker is 1.51×10-8

296

(excluding independent replications).

297

Rs1799971 (A118G) maps to exon 1 of the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene, causing

298

an amino acid change from asparagine to aspartic acid. Extensive candidate studies of this

299

variant with a wide range of addictive and other behavioral traits have been conducted over two

300

decades. Associations between rs1799971 and opioid-related traits have not been consistent

301

[5]. We conducted hypothesis-free, genome-wide analyses for OUD and detected association at

302

rs1799971 by almost quintupling the number of cases compared to any previous studies [5, 16].

303

Our increment in exposed controls, which have often been even more limiting than affected

304

OUD subjects in previous studies, is even greater. Since many individuals exposed to opioids

305

become dependent, an unassessed control group is not an ideal alternative to an opioid-

306

exposed control group even if greater numbers of subjects can be achieved – because the

307

former group is more correctly “diagnosis unknown” and inevitably contains many subjects

308

genetically predisposed to OUD who would express that phenotype had they been exposed. We

309

sought replication in two independent samples. One included newly genotyped Yale-Penn

310

subjects, and the other, a proxy-phenotype buprenorphine treatment sample from the UKB. The

311

association was replicated in each of these samples.

312

Although we still encounter a relative lack of power overall as indicated by no additional

313

variant detected beyond rs1799971, a lack of any significant gene associated in gene-based

314

analysis, and no gene-set enrichment, there is reasonable power for genetic correlation.

Multiple substance use-related traits including smoking, alcohol, and opioid use and psychiatric

316

traits were among the top correlates. Several smoking traits were positively correlated with

317

OUD, consistent with the strong correlation between nicotine use and opioid use disorder [35,

318

36]. MR analysis provided evidence (considered weak, as it is not supported by all the three

319

tested methods) that the genetic liability to substance use related traits has causal effects on

320

susceptibility to OUD. Medical opioid use is correlated with OUD, as expected. And problematic

321

alcohol use (measured by AD and AUDIT-P score) and drinking quantity are also genetically

322

correlated with OUD. Thus, it may be feasible for prevention or treatment efforts directed at

323

legal substance use to reduce the burden of consequent opioid dependence. Psychiatric traits

324

including ADHD, MDD, schizophrenia, and neuroticism are genetically correlated with OUD,

325

consistent with phenotypic evidence [37, 38]. Weak evidence from MR analyses also indicated

326

possible causal effects on OUD risk of MDD and neuroticism.

327

We note limitations of this study. First, the sample size, though a major improvement, is

328

still not as large as what can be obtained for legal substance use-related traits, and this limited

329

power to detect more GWS signals and to obtain insight into OUD biological mechanisms. Legal

330

substance use traits are more common, and data pertinent to these traits is collected more

331

commonly than for illegal traits in biobanks and EHRs. Second, the phenotypes in the samples

332

we studied were not identical. The MVP used ICD 9/10-diagnosed OUD. We expect false

333

negatives in a sample like the MVP, owing to stigma and insufficient vigilance on the part of

334

treatment teams concentrating mostly on medical illness, but few false positives. Overall, we

335

believe these diagnoses to be quite useful, as false positives would be more of a problem than

336

false negatives. Third, the only GWS variant, rs1799971, has a very small effect size (beta=-

337

0.066). The association was close to GWS in MVP alone, and improved by meta-analysis. High

338

quality genotype data and replication in an independent sample were required. Rs1799971 was

339

genotyped directly (was not imputed) in all samples, discovery and replication. Fourth, the

340

replication samples are small (508 OD cases in the new Yale-Penn sample and 240

341

buprenorphine treatment cases in UKB), and the associations only nominally significant

342

(p~0.05). We examined only this one marker in the replication samples, so nominal significance

343

should be a sufficient test of replication (and arguably a 1-tailed test could have been applied

344

rather than the more stringent 2-tailed test applied here). The phenotype in UKB is a proxy

345

phenotype–buprenorphine treatment. Although buprenorphine is a first-line drug for OUD

346

treatment, it could have been used for other purposes in the UKB population, including pain

347

management; but if this is true to any considerable extent, it should reduce our power to detect

348

an association due to added noise, rather than lead to a false positive finding. Fifth, we only

349

studied samples with European ancestry. There has been a lack of recruitment for non-

350

European populations globally, e.g., only a few GWASs have been conducted in AAs [6, 14] in

351

smaller cohorts.

352

In summary, we report here the largest GWAS and the largest meta-analysis for OUD so

353

far. This finding may not have direct implications for personalized medicine – because the

354

relevant gene is already the main physiological target of all opioids, illegal and therapeutic;

355

providing, at least, a “proof of principle” of relevance of the finding. OUD is genetically correlated

356

with substance use traits, other psychiatric traits, insomnia, and cognitive performance. Among

357

these, ever smoked regularly, MDD, neuroticism, and cognitive performance have potential

358

causal or protective effects on the liability of OUD, which provides clues for future prevention

359

efforts. Recruitment of additional OUD subjects – especially of non-European ancestry – is a

360

crucial next step. Considering the general lack of private foundation funding for study of

361

substance use disorders, it is likely that government-supported funding agencies will be required

362

to accomplish this goal.
