ABSTRACT
Objective: Guidelines recommend expert pathology review of Barrett’s oesophagus (BO)
biopsies that reveal dysplasia, but there are no evidence-based standards to corroborate
expert reviewer status. We investigated BO concordance rates and pathologist features
predictive of diagnostic discordance amongst a large international cohort of gastrointestinal
pathologists to develop a quantitative model of BO expert review.
Design: Pathologists (n=55) from over 20 countries assessed 55 digitised BO biopsies from
across the diagnostic spectrum, before and after viewing matched p53
immunohistochemistry. Extensive demographic and clinical experience data were obtained
via online questionnaire. We calculated discordance rates and applied multivariate
regression analyses to identify predictors of concordance.
Results: We recorded over 6,000 individual case diagnoses. Of 2,805 H&E diagnoses, we
found excellent concordance (>70%) for non-dysplastic Barrett’s oesophagus (NDBO) and
high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and intermediate concordance for low-grade dysplasia (LGD,
42%) and indefinite for dysplasia (IND, 23%). Major diagnostic errors (i.e. NDBO
overinterpreted as LGD/HGD or vice versa) were found in 248 diagnoses (8.8%), which
reduced to 8.3% after viewing p53 labelled slides. At least 5 years of professional experience
was protective against major diagnostic error for H&E slide review (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.310.74). Working in a district general hospital was associated with increased odds of major
diagnostic error (OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.15-2.69), however this was neutralised when
pathologists viewed p53 labelled slides, suggesting a beneficial impact of p53
immunohistochemistry for this group.
Conclusion: We have developed an evidence-based quantitative model of BO
histopathology diagnosis at expert consensus level that will inform guideline development.

INTRODUCTION
Barrett’s oesophagus (BO) is a premalignant condition, which predisposes to esophageal
adenocarcinoma (OAC), with a reported annual conversion rate of 0.1 - 0.2%. 1-3 BO is
defined histopathologically as the replacement of normal stratified squamous epithelial lining
of the distal oesophagus with columnar epithelium that can contain intestinal metaplasia. The
implementation of formal surveillance strategies and widespread adoption of endoscopic
treatment techniques, such as endoscopic resection and ablation for dysplastic BO, have led
to a surge in diagnostic pathology workload. The goal of endoscopic surveillance and biopsy
verification is objective risk stratification for patients according to their perceived progression
risk to OAC.
Previous studies have revealed, however, that diagnostic reproducibility (interobserver agreement) amongst pathologists grading dysplastic BO biopsy material is
moderate to poor, even amongst expert reviewers (Supplementary Table 1). 4-17 Previous
work from our group has shown that central pathology review by a dedicated panel within the
context of prospective intervention trials failed to confirm an initial diagnosis of low-grade
dysplasia (LGD) in over three-quarters of cases submitted for panel review. On follow up,
cases that had been downgraded to non-dysplastic BO (NDBO) revealed a nominal
progression risk of about 0.5% per patient/year, whilst cases that had been confirmed LGD
on central review showed a progression risk of about 10% per patient/year. These data
clearly attest to the clinical return of dedicated pathology review. 18 19 International BO
management guidelines now mandate histopathology review of all BO biopsy cases found to
reveal dysplasia by an independent expert pathologist. 20 21 However, whilst major society
guidelines have qualitatively defined an expert BO pathologist as ‘a pathologist with a special
interest in BO-related neoplasia who is recognised as an expert in this field by their peers’,
we lack firm evidence-based standards to corroborate expert reviewer status. 21-26 This now
represents an acute unmet need as these considerations also carry important medico-legal
implications.
Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of whole slide
imaging (WSI) for primary diagnostic use. 27 The advantages of WSI are numerous and
include simultaneous assessment by multiple pathologists, streamlined expert consultation,
and digital image analysis. It is expected that digital pathology will rapidly gain widespread
acceptance in the coming years, in particular in the context of distant case review. A number
of large-scale diagnostic consensus studies have been performed, which have broadly
suggested that the diagnostic discordance rate between pathologists using digital slide
review is non-inferior to conventional glass slide diagnosis. 28-30 However, these studies
generally examined a large number of diagnostic categories without focusing on a particular
category of known diagnostic discordance such as Barrett’s dysplasia. Establishing the
validity of this new technology to BO histopathologic workup is therefore a clear priority.
Here we set out to develop quantitative standards of expert reviewer status for
guideline development purposes using massive online digital pathology reporting. We define
expert reviewer status as evidence of diagnostic concordance on a par with consensus within
an expert review panel, acknowledging that, in lieu of an objective biomarker of progression
risk, there will be diagnostic variation amongst expert pathologists. We collected extensive
demographic information of participating pathologists to understand operator-dependent
predictors of diagnostic variation.

METHODS
Ethical considerations
This study utilised anonymised archived formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded material and did
not require approval from the relevant Institutional Ethics Committee under applicable local
regulatory law (‘Code of conduct’, FEDERA).
Assessors
Sixty-five gastrointestinal pathologists worldwide were approached to join this study through
either professional gastrointestinal pathology working groups or direct professional contacts.
Fifty-nine pathologists responded positively to our enquiries and were recruited to this study
of which 51 pathologists completed the entire case set of 55 H&E-stained and 55 matching
p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) labelled slides (110 slides total). These 51 pathologists are
henceforth referred to as participating pathologists. Participating pathologists received emails
detailing the study objectives and were provided with personal log-in credentials to the
purpose-built online scoring environment described below. Lead study author (MvdW)
provided assistance with participating pathologists’ log-in queries, evaluated study progress,
and chaired the panel consensus meeting.
Four BO pathologists (including two study authors, MJ and SM) with extensive
experience in BO dysplasia assessment reviewed all slides as a reference pathologist panel.
This group has successfully collaborated on previous BO intervention studies where patient
outcome has been evaluated prospectively 18 19 31-37 as well as on the Amsterdam Barrett’s
Advisory Committee. 31 These pathologists are henceforth referred to as reference
pathologists.
Slide selection and scanning
The lead study author selected a representative case-mix of 55 BO biopsy cases from across
the diagnostic spectrum (Supplementary Table 2). Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis
confirmed by a second gastrointestinal pathologist; documented clinical follow-up of at least
one year available; and tissue block available. Per case, immunohistochemical staining for
p53 was performed using a Ventana Benchmark XT autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems,
Tucson, AZ). Antigen retrieval was performed with CC1 mild. P53 was detected with p53
Antibody (Mouse DO-7 + BP 53-12, Thermo Scientific) and the sections were incubated in a
1:500 dilution for 32 min at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected using the Biotin
free Ultraview Universal DAB Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics) and slides were
counterstained with Hematoxylin (Roche Diagnostics). 38 One H&E slide and one consecutive
section p53 IHC slide were digitised from each case using a scanner with a 20x microscope
objective (Slide, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Scans were checked for focus and acuity by the
study coordinator and re-scanned if necessary. Subsequently, slides were anonymised,
randomised, renamed, and stored on a secure server. The ‘Digital Slidebox 4.5’
(https://dsb.amc.nl/dsb/login.php, Slidepath, Leica Microsystems, Dublin, Ireland) virtual slide
viewing software was used to evaluate the digital slides during the study.

Template electronic Case Record Forms (CRFs) were custom built within a web-based
software tool designed to capture clinical study data (OpenClinica v3.6, an open source
CTMM TraiT project, LLC, Waltham, USA). One CRF consists of an extensive questionnaire
documenting pathologist characteristics such as age, sex, host institution, and experience in
reporting BO biopsies and digital pathology (full questionnaire details in Supplementary
Table 3). The second CRF was built to record individual case diagnoses. Importantly, this
second CRF consists of separate parts to record H&E and H&E plus p53 IHC slide
diagnoses independently. The first part of the case diagnosis CRF contains a dynamic URL
link to the scanned H&E slide and includes questions about the slide quality and diagnosis,
and whether the assessor feels they require a p53 IHC slide. Importantly, the second part of
the templated CRF that contains a dynamic link to the p53 IHC slide alongside the matching
H&E slide, only opens after the study pathologist has completed assessment of the H&Estained slide and saved their case diagnosis for this slide. This second part of the templated
CRF, in addition to a dynamic link to the matching p53 IHC slide, again included
corresponding slide assessment questions.
Digital case assessments
Reference and participating pathologists were asked to assess each case, according to the
modified Vienna classification for gastrointestinal neoplasia. 39 40 Reference pathologists first
assessed all cases individually and completed the questionnaire. An online consensus
meeting was then convened after a two-month wash out period to discuss discrepancies and
produce reference diagnoses for each of the 110 assessments (55 H&E-stained slides and
55 matching p53 IHC). The panel assessment was taken forward as the reference diagnosis
without further discussion if reference panel members achieved a majority diagnosis (i.e.
concordance between either 3 out of 4 or 4 out of 4 pathologists) on a case directly from their
independent scoring. Group discussions were held between these four pathologists to review
and discuss cases for which there was no majority diagnosis to mimic real-world practice.
The discrepancies where a majority diagnosis had not been reached after individual slide
review encompassed 21 cases based on H&E slide viewing, and 13 cases based on the p53
IHC slide. These cases were reviewed during the panel discussion (21 H&E slides reviewed
without matching p53 IHC slide, and 13 cases with H&E-stained slide and matching p53 IHC)
to arrive at a consensus diagnosis for all 110 assessments.
From the case assessments by the participating pathologists two p53 IHC case
assessments were inadvertently left blank by individual participating pathologists (one each)
after evaluating the case H&E slide. Results from the matching H&E slides were imputed as
p53 case diagnosis in these cases, based on the H&E slide score, corresponding to 2 HGD
diagnoses.
Statistical analysis
Characteristics of the four reference pathologists and the 51 participating pathologists were
compared informally. We examined the overall concordance of the study pathologists
compared to the consensus reference diagnosis per case. This process was conducted for
each of the four individual members of the reference panel against the final consensus
diagnosis of this panel, as well as for the overall sample of 51 pathologists against the
consensus diagnosis. Per pathologist scores were not calculated, since we aimed to study
the cohort behavior rather than the individual pathologist. Concordance was initially

compared based on four relevant diagnostic categories (NDBO, IND, LGD, HGD), and then
compared based on three relevant diagnostic categories (NDBO, IND, LGD or HGD) to
reflect the fact that HGD and LGD are now treated endoscopically in some settings. 32 We
calculated 95% CIs for overall concordance and per diagnostic category. Since this cohort
was strongly enriched for dysplasia, we did not use kappa statistics, since these are less
reliable when cross tables are skewed.
To evaluate the severity of discordant interpretations across the cohort of
participating pathologists, we then reclassified all discordant assessments as either major or
minor discordances. Major overinterpretation is defined as NDBO reference diagnosis
overinterpreted as either LGD or HGD, whereas, vice versa, major underinterpretation is
LGD or HGD reference diagnosis underinterpreted as NDBO by the participating pathologist.
These discordant interpretations would bear major consequences in clinical practice. All
other discordant interpretations were classified as minor discordant interpretations. A tabular
overview of interpretation classifications as major or minor is shown in Supplementary
Table 4. Since both major overinterpretation and major underinterpretation can have
negative implications for patient management, these were further combined for the purposes
of some analyses, as indicated.
Unadjusted logistic regression analyses were then conducted to identify any
pathologist characteristics that were associated with overall and major over or
underinterpretation of BO cases, compared to the consensus diagnosis. Considering that
age and professional experience are inextricably linked, we evaluated individual
combinations of age and experience for odds of major over and underinterpretations, and
combined these into three categories in whom similar odds ratios were observed
(Supplementary Table 5). Forward selection of significant factors was used to create
multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models of characteristics associated with
misinterpretation. Although routine use of p53 immunohistochemistry was not associated
with diagnostic errors, this was retained in multivariate models for p53 stained slides. All
statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp., College Station,
TX, USA).

RESULTS
Study design
This study is based on assessments of digitised slides to investigate diagnostic concordance
of BO biopsies amongst a large and heterogeneous sample of gastrointestinal pathologists.
We investigated rates and features predictive of diagnostic concordance amongst these
pathologists, with a particular focus on the demographic characteristics of the pathologists,
the impact of viewing p53 labelled slides alongside H&E-stained slides, and on features
associated with major diagnostic discordance that would negatively impact upon patient
stratification and treatment pathways. The purpose of this study was to build a quantitative
model of expert BO pathologist review characteristics, and to provide practical
recommendations that could minimize errors in the interpretation of BO biopsies in the
routine setting.
The study flowchart is shown in Figure 1A. All pathologists first filled out a baseline
questionnaire for detailed demographic and clinical experience data. Pathologists then

assessed the 110 digitised slides (55 H&E slides and matching p53 IHC) and recorded their
answers on dedicated electronic CRFs. As detailed in the methods section, diagnostic
entries were recorded after viewing the H&E-stained slide and again after the matched p53
IHC was revealed alongside the case H&E slide.
The entire study set was completed by fifty-five pathologists working in over 20
countries and 5 continents (Figure 1B). Of these fifty-five pathologists, 4 pathologists with
extensive and published experience in BO dysplasia assessment were designated
beforehand as reference pathologists. 18 19 32 41 42 In sum, with 55 pathologists reviewing 55
biopsy cases, each of which includes one H&E-stained slide and a matched p53 IHC, this
generated a massive dataset of over 6,000 case diagnoses as input data for our Barrett’s
digital pathology (BOLERO) consensus study, one of the largest digital pathology consensus
studies reported thus far. Case diagnoses were compared to reference diagnoses and we
searched for pathologist demographic features that predict diagnostic consensus at expert
level.
Patient characteristics of BO biopsy samples
Patient characteristics of the sample biopsies are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Of
these patients, 94.5% was male (52/55). The median age at diagnosis was 65, the median
BMI was 27, the median BO segment length was Circumferential (C) 4 cm, Maximum (M) 5
cm. Patients had a history of smoking in 63.6% of cases (35/55), a history of heartburn
symptoms in 89% of cases (49/55), and used anti-reflux medication in 96.4% of cases
(53/55).
Pathologist characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the pathologists taking part in the study are displayed in Table 1
and Supplementary table 6. Participating pathologists represented a heterogeneous sample
comprising a wide range of ages, workplace settings (academic teaching, private and/or
district general hospital settings) and years of professional experience. Just over 50% of
participating pathologists reported dedicated fellowship experience, whilst the majority (72%)
worked in a large laboratory with ≥10 pathologist colleagues. The most commonly reported
guidelines to which pathologists adhered were North American, British, or Japanese,
however a quarter of pathologists reported using other guidelines in their clinical practice.
Two thirds of participating pathologists self-identified as expert gastrointestinal pathologists.
Note that although pathologists were approached through international working groups, no
effort was made to purposely recruit experts onto the study. Pathologists also reported on
other parameters and working practices in their laboratories, such as typical numbers of BO
cases reported per week, confidence and enjoyment in reporting BO, reporting of endoscopic
resection specimens, frequency of adjunct p53 IHC use in BO reporting, participation in
double-reporting, multi-disciplinary team meetings, and use of WSI, as well as typical
interactions and perceptions of practices of their endoscopy colleagues (Table 1 and
Supplementary table 6). Participating and reference pathologists were generally well
matched for age ranges and professional experience although all four reference pathologists
were male, whereas 22 of 51 (43.1%) participating pathologists in the larger cohort were
female.

A total of 3,025 diagnoses were generated based on H&E-stained slide case review and
another 3,025 diagnoses were recorded after viewing the matching p53 IHC slides for study
cases (Figure 2A and B). The corresponding waterfall plots showing the ranked distribution
of assessments reveal a gradual transition from NDBO examples with high interobserver
concordance to HGD cases with similarly high interobserver concordance and diagnostic
categories where concordance gradually transitions between these extremes. These plots
also confirm that our case set includes representative biopsies from across the diagnostic
spectrum of BO pathology. Relevant examples of study cases are shown in Figure 2C.
Concordance of reference pathologists vs. consensus diagnosis on H&E and p53
labelled slides
Consensus diagnoses were generated following panel review. The reference panel
consensus diagnoses for the H&E-stained slide case review included 16 NDBO, 6 IND, 18
LGD, and 15 HGD case diagnoses. After the addition of matched p53 IHC and reference
panel review a small number of cases were reclassified, including 1 NDBO diagnosis as
LGD, 1 LGD diagnosis as NDBO, and 4 IND diagnoses as LGD, thus totaling 16 NDBO, 2
IND, 22 LGD and 15 HGD after p53 IHC slide review.
Individual consensus panel member diagnoses were then compared to the final
consensus panel diagnosis to obtain concordance rates between the 4 reference
pathologists. This revealed excellent diagnostic agreement when reporting NDBO, LGD and
HGD on H&E-stained slides alone (84.4%, 65.3% and 78.3%, respectively), rising to 89.4%
when LGD and HGD diagnoses were combined. After revealing the matching p53 IHC slide
for the 55 cases, agreement further improved to 85.9% for ND, 72.7% for LGD, and 76.7%
for HGD, rising to 91.9% when LGD and HGD were combined (Supplementary Tables 7A
and B).
Concordance of participating pathologists vs. consensus diagnosis on H&E and p53
stained slides
The complete set of 5,610 case assessments recorded by the 51 participating pathologists
was then compared to the reference panel diagnoses to obtain concordance rates and
compare diagnostic agreement within and between categories. The diagnostic agreement
between 51 participating pathologists for H&E-stained slide diagnoses is depicted in Figure
3A-C and Supplementary Figure 1A, while concordance percentages are shown in Table
2A. We found excellent concordance between the participating pathologists for NDBO
reference diagnosis cases (643 of 816 diagnoses; 78.8%) and HGD reference diagnosis
cases (544 of 765 diagnoses; 71.1%). As expected, there was moderate concordance for
LGD reference diagnosis cases (382 of 918; 41.6%) and poor concordance for IND reference
diagnosis cases (70 of 306; 22.9%). However, if dysplastic assessments were grouped (i.e.
combining LGD and HGD reference diagnosis cases) then 77.5% (1,305 of 1,683) of cases
were concordant. Major over or underinterpretation was found in 8.8% of assessments (248
of 2,805 diagnoses).
Addition of matched p53 IHC improved diagnostic concordance (Figure 3D-F and
Supplementary Figure 1B) with small but clinically meaningful improvements seen in the
diagnostic concordance between participating pathologists for NDBO reference diagnosis
cases (83.8% v. 78.8% on H&E slide) and LGD/HGD combined reference diagnosis cases
(79.3% v. 77.5% on H&E slide), Table 2B. In addition to this, p53 IHC also had a small but

beneficial impact on reducing the number of major over and underinterpretations (8.3%, 232
of 2,805 diagnoses), representing 0.5% fewer overall major misinterpretations compared to
H&E-stained slide diagnosis alone.
Characteristics associated with concordance on H&E slides
This massive dataset was then interrogated to search for histopathologist predictors of over
or underreporting and major diagnostic errors in univariate analysis. To this end all diagnostic
discordances within our dataset (i.e. case diagnoses not matching reference diagnosis) were
first reclassified as major or minor over or underinterpretation (see Methods and
Supplementary Table 4). Factors associated with reduced odds of major diagnostic errors
included: ≥5 years of experience commensurate with age (OR 0.65, 95%CI 0.45-0.93);
working in an academic teaching hospital (OR 0.59, 95%CI 0.43-0.81); routinely double
reporting indefinite for dysplasia cases (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.52-0.94); working in a larger lab
(≥10 versus <10 pathologists OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.54-0.96) and using digital pathology (OR
0.63; 95%CI 0.47-0.89). In contrast, working within a district general hospital (OR 1.72,
95%CI 1.30-2.26) or private hospital (OR 1.41, 95%CI 1.04-1.91), or not using major society
guidelines (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.06-1.94) were all associated with increased odds of major
diagnostic errors (Supplementary Tables 8A-C).
Several factors were not associated with major diagnostic error, including pathologist
sex. Participating in upper gastrointestinal multidisciplinary team meetings was not
associated with reduced odds of major diagnostic error, although it was associated with
reduced odds of overreporting. Notably, self-identifying as a Barrett’s pathology expert,
holding a dedicated fellowship, or reporting greater enjoyment or confidence in Barrett’s
reporting were not associated with significant odds of major over or underinterpretation
(Supplementary Table 8A).
Reporting ≥20 cases per week was associated with reduced odds of over or underinterpretation of Barrett’s dysplasia (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.53-0.89), although this association
was attenuated when investigating major diagnostic errors (Supplementary Table 8B).
Multivariate analyses before and after revealing matched p53 IHC
Multivariable models were then applied, including all factors associated with collective over
and underinterpretation on H&E digital slide review in univariate analysis, as shown in Table
3. At least 5 years of experience commensurate with age was the strongest protective factor
against major diagnostic error on H&E slide review (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.31-0.74). In contrast,
working in a district general hospital was associated with increased odds of major diagnostic
error (OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.15-2.69), however this was neutralised if pathologists in these
settings viewed cases with additional p53 IHC (OR 1.44, 95%CI 0.92-2.28). As expected,
routine use of p53 IHC was associated with reduced odds of major diagnostic error. Viewing
5-19 BO cases with p53 stained slides per week was associated with increased odds of
major diagnostic errors, which was neutralised when viewing ≥20 cases per week. Most other
results showed similar trends to those seen in univariate analysis, but these were no longer
statistically significant (Table 3).

We have carried out the largest investigation of diagnostic concordance of BO biopsy
reporting amongst gastrointestinal pathologists to date. Previous studies had been limited to
a small number of expert pathologists, which meant findings were not necessarily
generalizable to real-world settings. This work has revealed several novel findings. First,
overall concordance for H&E digital slide review of NDBO and LGD/HGD as a combined
outcome was excellent (exceeding 77%), although concordance for IND and LGD as a
stand-alone diagnosis was lower (23-42%). These test characteristics replicate known glass
slide test characteristics (Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that distant BO biopsy slide
review is reproducible and safe. Second, the addition of adjunct p53 IHC resulted in small,
but clinically meaningful improvements in concordance and a reduction from 8.8% to 8.3% in
the prevalence of major misinterpretations of BO dysplasia for pathologists working at a
general hospital, signifying that p53 IHC could serve as an extra protection against
misdiagnoses for these pathologists working away from teaching hospitals. The limited
impact of p53 addition could also be due to a lack of guidelines on staining interpretation.
Lastly, multivariate analyses revealed several pathologist characteristics and working
practices associated with the prevalence of misinterpretations. Reassuringly, pathologist
experience commensurate with age was most protective against major over or
underinterpretation, confirming the validity of our experimental strategy. Our multivariate
demographic regression analyses also confirm that working within a teaching hospital
environment protects against major diagnostic error. This provides supportive evidence for
guideline statements that BO complicated by dysplasia is best managed within an expert
center. 21-23 26.
We found that the overall prevalence of major misinterpretations of dysplastic BO
(NDBO classified as LGD/HGD, or vice versa) in this cohort enriched for IND/LGD/HGD
cases was 8.8%, which was further reduced, if marginally, by the addition of p53 IHC (8.3%).
Although this would suggest a limited impact of the implementation of p53 IHC, our data also
reveals that major discordance was reduced by the addition of p53 IHC, specifically for those
pathologists working away from teaching hospital settings. Acknowledging that any reduction
in the prevalence of major misinterpretation of BO biopsy material is beneficial, these
important data suggest that the impact of adjunct p53 IHC is dependent on context and is
greatest outside expert center settings. Routine use of p53 IHC labelling is supported by
several national guidelines, 21 23 26 and our study confirms that this is appropriate.
Taken together, our study for the first time provides an evidence-based quantitative
model of BO histopathology diagnosis at expert consensus level. Our findings have several
implications for clinical practice of pathology reporting in BO. Diagnostic concordance within
a large group of pathologists with different levels of gastrointestinal pathology expertise was
excellent for LGD and HGD combined. To implement routine external review of dysplastic
BO biopsies, as mandated by several major society guidelines, requires regional teams of
dedicated gastrointestinal pathologists. Our data reassuringly suggest that BO reporting on a
par with expert consensus is not limited to a small league of experienced histopathologists
and can be predicted from a small number of intuitive demographic predictors (experience,
professional setting, use of p53 IHC). Combined with our observation that concordance rates
for digital slide viewing were not inferior to conventional glass slide pathology review 18 19,
together these data suggest that distant digital review of problematic BO cases is safe to
formally implement within current care delivery systems, provided quality benchmarks are
met.

Our study has considerable strengths compared to previous interobserver variation
studies of BO reporting. We have evaluated diagnostic concordance for dysplastic BO
amongst the largest group of gastrointestinal pathologists worldwide. The heterogeneous mix
of pathologists involved in this study also enabled novel investigations into pathologistdependent predictors associated with diagnostic discordance. The online reporting strategy
mimicked routine workflow and facilitated data collection and curation in a flexible manner.
The case set was purposely enriched for dysplastic cases in order to attain sufficient
statistical power in our downstream regression analyses.
This study also has limitations that are important to note. First, acknowledging that
the diagnostic spectrum of BO represents a morphologic continuum, we aimed to include
diagnostic categories from across the diagnostic spectrum, including arbitrary cases that
straddle the transition from low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia, as well as indefinite
for dysplasia cases. Our case-mix for this reason does not represent a cross-section of
diagnostic biopsy cases encountered in daily practice, which would be heavily weighted
towards the NDBO end of the spectrum. A second limitation is that while our heterogeneous
global group of pathologists allowed us to interrogate associations of a host of operatordependent characteristics with diagnostic consensus (case volume, practice setting,
diagnostic experience, etc.), this study feature may limit the generalizability of our findings
within the national setting. Replication of our findings in samples of pathologists within
particular geographic regions adhering to one diagnostic guideline will be required to
determine whether the quantitative predictive features described here are similarly applicable
in that setting. Given that the majority of pathologists participating in this study were based
either in Europe or North America, greater representation from low to middle income settings
would be particularly welcome. This could further enhance the value of this recursive
exercise for teaching and registration purposes.
In conclusion, using this rich dataset of case assessments by a large, heterogeneous
sample of gastrointestinal pathologists, we have evaluated diagnostic concordance for BO
diagnosis using digital case review. Our results reveal quantitative predictors of diagnostic
performance that will aid formulation of quality assurance criteria for guideline development
and standard implementation of digital pathology in BO biopsy review.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1: Study design and study participants | A) Fifty-five representative BO biopsies
with H&E slide and consecutive p53 IHC were collected and scanned for digital
diagnostic review. Each pathologist on the study first completed a detailed
demographic questionnaire (Supplementary Table 3). Pathologists then assessed
55 biopsy cases whereby diagnostic entries on H&E slide alone and after revealing
matched p53 IHC were recorded separately allowing detailed insight into the
added benefit of p53 IHC on diagnostic agreement. Reference diagnoses were
established after consensus panel meeting. Within-group interobserver agreement
was established for reference panel (n=4) and participating pathologists (N=51)
and multivariate regression analyses were carried out to interrogate demographic
predictors of diagnostic concordance, as detailed in the text. B) Map showing
geographical dispersion of pathologists participating in the BOLERO study.
