Abstract:
The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 raised standards for foods sold in US schools. The
aims of this paper are to estimate policy effects on dietary quality of US school-aged children,
and determine if effects differed by free/reduced-price meal eligibility or age group. We
estimated within-child associations between school food consumption and dietary quality
(using Health Eating Index - 2010), by comparing two 24-hour dietary recalls per child from the
2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used inverse probability
weighting to account for population changes during this period. We scaled changes of
association (implementation period versus pre-passage) by proportion of energy from school
foods. School foods were 10% of annual calories, 33% on days when children ate school foods.
Each percentage point of energy from school foods was associated with 0.08 more Healthy
Eating Index points during implementation than pre-passage. The scaled estimated effect of
policy implementation on annual dietary quality is 0.84 Healthy Eating Index points, 2.8 points
on days when children eat school foods. Estimated effects were slightly greater for children
eligible for free/reduced-price meals and high school-aged children, though confidence
intervals include zero. The results indicate that targeted policies can improve children’s dietary
quality.

Poor dietary quality is the leading risk factor related to death and disability in the US (1).
Although dietary quality of US children improved from 1999 to 2012, average dietary quality
remains poor (2,3). In addition to immediate impacts of eating a suboptimal diet, eating habits
formed during childhood and adolescence persist into adulthood (4–6), underlining the
relevance of childhood dietary quality to health across the life course.
The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) were
established to provide federal support to children’s nutrition (7). The NSLP serves 30 million
lunches and the SBP serves 15 million breakfasts per school day (8). NSLP and SBP provide free
or reduced-price (FRP) meals to children from households with incomes up to 1.85 times the
poverty level (7). Children who receive FRP meals are more likely to eat school meals than
children from higher income households (9). Addditionally, elementary and middle school
students are more likely to eat school meals than high school students (9).
Following a period of federal, state and local policy reforms (10), the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids
Act of 2010 (HHFKA) (11) was signed into law on December 13, 2010. HHFKA reformed national
standards for all foods served in schools (10), better aligning school foods to new dietary
guidelines (12). HHFKA rules affecting NSLP/SBP meals (10), competitive foods (e.g. a la carte
items), and snacks (13), went into effect over a two-year period from 2012 to 2014.
Among other changes, the HHFKA required schools to offer more servings of fruits and
vegetables, greater variety of vegetables, half of grain servings as at least 50% whole grain, limit
fat content in milk, and set calorie and sodium limits (12). New meal standards (14) began July
1, 2012 for school lunches and July 1, 2013 for school breakfasts. Minimum nutritional
standards for all other foods sold in schools went into effect on July 1, 2014 (13). Although
some rollback occurred in the new administration (15), each requirement remains more
stringent than rules prior to July 1, 2012. See Web Appendix for a summary table of HHFKA
changes to NSLP/SBP meals.
Evaluations of the dietary effects of HHFKA have examined changes in food selection,
consumption, and plate waste in school cafeterias (16–20). Students’ cafeteria food selection
and consumption shifted to more nutrient-dense, less energy-dense foods (20), including more

vegetables (16,18,19) and whole fruits (16,18,19), and less fruit juice (18). One study found
increased plate waste following HHFKA implementation actually reduced fruit and vegetable
consumption (17).
A post-HHFKA report compared 24-hour dietary recalls from children who ate a school meal
with matched nonparticipants (8). School meal participants had better dietary quality than
nonparticipants (8), but the study did not compare dietary recalls before and after HHFKA.
The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of HHFKA implementation on the total
dietary quality of all US school-aged children. This was the first study to examine pre-post
HHFKA differences in the effect of the NSLP/SBP on population-level, average annual dietary
quality. The primary comparison in this study was between the four years before passage of the
HHFKA (2007-2010) and the four years after implementation began (2013-2016). We also
examined if the effect of HHFKA implementation differed for children eligible for FRP meals
versus ineligible, and high school-aged versus younger children.
METHODS
Data source
We used data from five waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), a repeated cross-sectional survey of the civilian, non-institutionalized population of
the US (21). NHANES files used in this analysis are Demographic Variables & Sample Weights,
Dietary Interview - Individual Foods, First Day, Dietary Interview - Total Nutrient Intakes, First
Day, Dietary Interview - Individual Foods, Second Day, Dietary Interview - Total Nutrient
Intakes, Second Day, and Diet Behavior & Nutrition.
Participants in this analysis were 4- to 19-year old children or adolescents who completed two,
24-hour dietary recalls and attended a K-12 school during the school year, in the 2007-2008
through 2015-2016 cycles (N = 9,532). Participants missing one or more variables used in
standardization (N = 1,007) were excluded, for a final analytic sample of 8,525.

Dietary assessment
NHANES participants completed questionnaires at home, then visited a mobile examination
center for a standardized physical examination and in-person 24-hour dietary recall (22), in
which the participant or their proxy reported everything they ate during the previous 24-hour
day (23). NHANES dietary interviews were conducted by proxy (typically a parent) through age
5, and with proxy assistance through age 11 (24). A second dietary recall was completed by
telephone on a nonconsecutive day after the MEC visit (22). Elementary school-aged children’s
reports in person or by telephone do not differ in accuracy (25).
Misreported food is a significant problem of memory-based dietary records, with both items
eaten but not reported, and items reported but not eaten, appearing in the records of
unassisted children (25) (NB, young children in NHANES were assisted). Although individual 24hour dietary recalls for children may have high levels of these errors, validation studies have
found they provide a valid population-level average of children’s energy intake (26).
Outcome: Healthy Eating Index-2010
Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) was developed to measure adherence to US dietary
guidelines (27) for individuals and populations. HEI-2010 is a valid and reliable measure of
dietary alignment with those guidelines (28). HEI-2010 includes 12 components, of which nine
assess the adequacy of dietary intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc.; three assess
dietary components to be consumed in moderation (refined grains, sodium, and empty
calories) (28).
We used the recommended per-day scoring algorithm (29) to create two HEI-2010 scores for
each person, for each 24-hour dietary recall. These scores were calculated using the Food
Pattern Equivalents Database versions of the NHANES dietary intake files, available from US
Department of Agriculture Food Surveys Research Group (30).

Exposure: Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010
This analysis includes three exposure time periods: 1) Pre-passage of the HHFKA (2007-2008
and 2009-2010), 2) Post-passage, but before implementation of new school meal rules (20112012), and 3) Implementation period (2013-2016). Because schools began to meet HHFKA goals
after the policy was passed, but before legal implementation (31), it was necessary to define an
intermediate “post-passage” period. The main comparison for all analyses will be between the
pre-passage and implementation period NHANES cycles.
Exposure: energy from school cafeteria foods
Each food item reported in the 24-hour dietary recall has a caloric value and reported source
(e.g., “Store - grocery/supermarket,” “Cafeteria in a K-12 school”). We followed a peerreviewed method for calculating the contribution of school foods to total energy intake (32),
summing calories only from food items reported from “Cafeteria in a K-12 school” and dividing
by total caloric intake from all food items.
Free and reduced-price meal eligibility
We defined FRP meal eligibility as binary household eligibility by poverty-income ratio. Eligible
children are in households at or below 1.85 times the poverty-income ratio (7). If a participant
does not have reported income (approximately 9% of participants), we substituted selfreported receipt of FRP meals. We prioritized the income indicator over self-reported FRP meal
receipt because participants were only asked if school meals were FRP if they reported eating
school meals. Therefore relying on self-report would overestimate school food intake among
eligible students.
High school-age
We identified children who reported having completed 8th grade or higher, or age 15 or older
at the time of exam if grade level is missing, as high school-aged (versus younger).

Standardization
Several demographic and economic characteristics: child’s sex, age, and race/ethnicity,
household size and poverty-income ratio, and the reference person’s (typically a parent)
education level and marital status, may modify the relationship between HHFKA
implementation and dietary quality. These factors are predictive of participation in NSLP (9) and
have been reported to relate to differences in child (2) and adult (33) dietary quality.
Demographic and economic changes in the US population during the 10-year period included in
this sample could therefore bias estimates of the total effect of the HHFKA.
To eliminate the association between HHFKA passage/implementation and the measured sociodemographic composition of the NHANES sample, we standardized the five samples to the
socio-demographic distribution of the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle using inverse probability
weighting (34–36).
We performed standardization by fitting an unsaturated multinomial logistic regression, using
the sampling weights provided by NHANES (36), to predict the probability that an individual
would be observed in each of the five cycles. Regression predictors were measured identically
in each NHANES cycle: participant’s continuous age and household size, categorical
racial/ethnic group (Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
other race - including multiracial), gender (male/female), eligibility by income for FRP meals,
household reference person’s marital status (currently married/not married), and reference
person’s educational attainment (college graduate/lesser attainment). Because this analysis
pools five cycles, we divided each participant’s dietary sample weight by five (21).
We created stabilized weights by dividing the predicted probability of being observed in the
2015-2016 cycle by the probability of being observed in the cycle the person was actually
observed in:

(

)

(34). The final analysis weights are the product of the

stabilized weights and the NHANES dietary two-day sample weight (36), which accounts for
demographic/geographic sampling probabilities, non-response to each 24-hour recall, day of
the week of the first 24-hour recall, and Day 1 and Day 2 weekday-weekend categories (37).

Analysis
We estimated the total effect of HHFKA implementation on dietary quality using a two-step
process. First, we estimated the proportion of total calories from school foods (including nonschool days) in the specified population or sub-population. Second, we estimated the
population-specific effect of each percentage point of calories from school foods in each
NHANES cycle (32). Thus the scaled estimated effect of food from school on diet quality is the
proportion of energy they reported getting from school foods times the effect per percentage
point. We address my main research question of how the HHFKA impacts diet quality by
estimating the difference in the scaled effect during the HHFKA implementation period
compared to the pre-passage period.
The two regression steps were conducted in R using the ‘survey’ package (38) to account for the
sampling design (21). We weighted the analyses using the stabilization weights described above
and applied appropriate stratification (21,39). Subgroup-specific proportion of energy from
school foods was calculated using the R marginal effects estimation package ‘ggeffects’ (40).
To estimate the population-specific effect of each percentage point of calories from school
foods, we calculated change scores for the outcome, difference in HEI-2010 score from the first
24-hour recall to the second 24-hour recall, ∆HEI-2010, and the exposure, difference in proportion
of energy from school cafeteria foods from the first to the second 24-hour recall,
∆%Energy from schools. Both the outcome and the exposure have a theoretical range of -100 to 100.
Change scores were necessary to maintain the appropriate survey design-based analysis as
widely available survey procedures do not accommodate repeated measures.
We adjusted analyses for day of the week of the dietary recall, which confounds the association
between school food exposure and dietary quality. We assigned a change score of -1 if the first
recall occurred on a weekend and the second on a weekday, 1 if the reverse, and 0 if both
occurred on weekdays or weekends. To distinguish participants with two weekday recalls from
those with two weekend recalls, a second variable was given a value of 1 if both recalls
occurred on weekend days and 0 otherwise. Weekend covariates were interacted with time
period.

Because the process that governs change in energy from school foods between Day 1 and Day 2
is random with respect to other independent predictors of change in HEI between recalls, we
assume the conditional association to be an unconfounded estimate of the effect of energy
from school foods on dietary quality. This analysis assumes the within-person effect of school
foods on HEI occurs only on days when school foods are eaten.
The final step of the analysis was to translate model estimates into population-level effects. The
total estimated effect of the HHFKA on the diets of all US children and specified subpopulations
is the product of two random variables estimating first, the proportion of dietary intake from
school foods, and second, the implementation period change in the effect on HEI score per
percentage point of energy from school foods. Means and variances for the scaled effect,
subgroup-specific scaled effects, and differences in estimated effects between subgroups were
calculated using standard mathematical formulas for the product and difference of random
variables.
Feasibility and sensitivity analyses
We conducted a feasibility analysis to ascertain if we could detect a difference in nutritional
density of school foods in children’s 24-hour dietary recalls. We used a peer-reviewed method
(41,42) to calculated the nutrient density of school-aged children’s weekday lunches in NHANES
2009-2016 dietary recalls. We used survey regression to compare changes in nutrient density of
lunches from school cafeterias versus any other source.
We conducted two sensitivity analyses. We tested the linearity of association between school
foods and dietary quality among all school-aged children by adding a quadratic interaction term
(∆%Energy from schools × |∆%Energy from schools|) to the model. We also tested the fit of three versus five
time periods (individual cycles). We compared the fit of those models to the models included in
this report using nested ANOVA. See Web Appendix for feasibility and sensitivity analysis
results.

RESULTS
Participant characteristics
The demographic characteristics of the total sample, the 2015-2016 target sample, and
standardized total sample are shown in Table 1. The standardized total sample closely matches
the demographic characteristics of the 2015-2016 cycle. The probability weights ranged from
0.4 to 4 (mean = 1.1).
[Insert Table 1]
Exposure to school foods
Ten percent of annual energy intake for school-aged children, including non-school days, came
from school cafeterias (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9, 11; see Table 2). This is similar to a
previous estimate of energy intake from school food using earlier NHANES cycles (32). Limited
to children who reported school foods in their Day 1 recall, 33% of Day 1 energy was from
school foods (95% CI: 32, 35).
[Insert Table 2]
Children eligible for FRP meals consumed more energy from school foods than did children who
were not eligible (13 vs. 7 percentage points, 𝑃 < 0.001, 2-sided). High school-aged children
consumed less energy from school foods than younger children (7 vs. 11 percentage points,
𝑃 < 0.001, 2-sided). The proportion of energy from school foods did not change significantly
across the three time periods.
Association between school foods and dietary quality
The within-person conditional association between change in school food consumption and
change in dietary quality is shown in Table 3. The unconditional association for responses with
no weekend days is shown in Figure 1. In the total population in the pre-passage period, each
percentage point of energy from school foods was associated with a 0.04-point increase in the
participant’s HEI score (95% CI: 0.01, 0.08). That association increased by 0.08 HEI points in the

implementation period, growing to a 0.13 point improvement in HEI for each percentage point
of energy from school foods (95% CI: 0.06, 0.19). Full model results are included in the Web
Appendix.
[Insert Table 3]
[Insert Figure 1]
Among students eligible for FRP meals, each percentage point of energy from school foods was
associated with greater HEI in the pre-passage period (95% CI: 0.02, 0.10). That association
increased by 0.09 HEI points in the implementation period to 0.15 HEI points per percentage
point of energy (95% CI: 0.08, 0.22). Among students not eligible for FRP meals, energy from
school cafeterias was not strongly associated with greater HEI scores in the pre-passage period
(95% CI: -0.03, 0.08). However, the effect grew by 0.08 HEI points in the implementation period
to 0.10 HEI points (95% CI: 0.00, 0.20).
For elementary/middle school students, each percentage point of energy from school in the
pre-passage period was associated with a 0.06-point increase in HEI scores (95% CI: 0.02, 0.10).
That association grew by 0.06 HEI points in the implementation period to 0.12 HEI points per
percentage point of energy (95% CI: 0.04, 0.19). For high school students, school foods were
neither beneficial nor harmful in the pre-passage period (95% CI: -0.07, 0.09). School meals
became substantialy more beneficial in the implementation period, growing to 0.14 HEI points
per percentage point of energy (95% CI: 0.00, 0.28).
The feasibility analysis showed that the nutrient density of children’s weekday lunches from
school cafeterias increased significantly in the implementation period compared to the prepassage period, while children’s weekday lunches from other sources were virtually unchanged.
The sensitivity analyses did not find improvement of fit using either a nonlinear association
between school food intake and dietary quality or a five-level time variable.

Scaled estimated policy effect
Scaled to the relative contribution of school foods to children’s overall energy intake (10%), the
estimated effect of the HHFKA on US school-aged children’s average dietary quality was 0.84
HEI points (95% CI: 0.28, 1.4). On days when children reported school cafeteria foods, averaging
33% of energy intake, the scaled estimated effect of the HHFKA on children’s dietary quality
was 2.8 HEI points (95% CI: 0.95, 4.7).
The scaled estimated effect was approximately twice as great for students eligible for FRP
meals (1.2 HEI points, 95% CI: 0.44, 1.9) than not eligible (0.58 HEI points, 95% CI: -0.08, 1.2),
although the 95% confidence interval of the difference includes zero (-0.40, 1.6). The scaled
estimated effect of the HHFKA on dietary quality was slightly greater for high school students
(0.95 HEI points, 95% CI: 0.13, 1.8) than younger children (0.67 HEI points, 95% CI: -0.06, 1.4),
although the 95% confidence interval for the difference again includes zero (-0.82, 1.4).
DISCUSSION
This study examined the dietary effects of the HHFKA in the context of children’s total diets. We
found that the first four years of HHFKA implementation was associated with improved dietary
quality on days when children ate school cafeteria foods. The findings of our study, scaled to
children’s average yearly school food consumption, suggest that that HHFKA implementation
between 2013 and 2016 improved the dietary quality of all US children by 0.84 points per day,
and by 2.8 points on days when children ate school meals. Although the daily effect of the
HHFKA appears small, the NSLP and SBP provide US children with 45 million meals per school
day (8), leading to a potentially large aggregate effect.
The HHFKA appears to have been particularly effective for students eligible for FRP meals, who
have greater reliance on school foods, and for high school students, whose school foods did not
boost dietary quality prior to the HHFKA. Contrary to some predictions, and consistent with
other evidence (43), we found no evidence that school food consumption declined during
HHFKA implementation.

Prior assessments of the dietary effects of the HHFKA analyzed children’s cafeteria food
selection and consumption (16–20). While this approach demonstrated the healthfulness and
desirability of new school foods, it did not contextualize policy effects within children’s total
diet. More importantly, pre-post studies risk unmeasured confounding due to secular trends in
children’s dietary intakes. That would be particularly difficult to rule out in this case because
children’s dietary quality was improving in the pre-HHFKA period (2). This study protects against
that threat because, at each time point, children serve as their own comparison group.
One limitation of this study is that it does not distinguish between changes in the quality of
food from school cafeterias and changes in the quality of food from other sources. However,
the results of the feasibility analysis showed improvements in school lunches, but no changes in
the nutrient density of weekday lunches from other sources. This suggests that the cause of the
observed improvement was changes in school foods, and not foods outside of school.
A more serious limitation is the inability to distinguish between federal, state, and local changes
in school meal standards. This limitation is inherent in conducting a national observational
study without detailed geographic information; however, the alignment of HHFKA passage and
implementation with NHANES cycles gives us confidence that improvements in school foods
observed in this study are from the policy of interest. The positive association between school
foods and dietary quality in the pre-passage period may be at least partially due to many stateand district-level policies implemented in the decade before HHFKA passage, and earlier
advocacy, which together made the HHFKA politically possible (10,44).
Further improving the quality of school foods could be an effective component of a broader set
of school practices and policies for reducing the long-term risk of chronic disease (45). All
subgroups we examined would benefit from increased NSLP/SBP participation, as long as school
foods are as nutritious as those offered now. High schools in particular could do more to
promote healthy school foods and restrict access to off campus lunches. Federal regulators
must resist pressure to return competitive foods of low nutritional value to schools. Federal
policy can improve the overall diet of US children, when policy is made in their best interest.
