Abstract

27

The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV), a major

28

public health issue worldwide with the potential for transmission via blood transfusion, in

29

blood donors in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia. Serum samples (n = 1,078) were collected

30

from volunteer blood donors from January to April 2019 and tested for the presence of anti-

31

HEV IgG and IgM by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Overall, the

32

seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM among blood donors was 5.7% and 1.3%,

33

respectively. Additionally, the seropositive rates of anti-HEV IgG and IgM were significantly

34

higher in non-Saudi donors (22.1% and 7.8%) than in Saudi donors (3% and 0.2%). The

35

seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG increased with age; however, there was no correlation

36

between gender and anti-HEV IgG and/or IgM. The seroprevalence of HEV among blood

37

donors in the Qassim Region was lower than previous estimates for other regions of the

38

country. Further studies covering a wider geographical area are needed to validate and

39

expand the findings and to determine the importance of HEV screening in the region.

Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), belonging to the Orthohepevirus genus in the family

47

Hepeviridae, causes liver diseases in humans [1]. The virus was first described in the early

48

1980s as a non-A and non-B hepatitis virus and was subsequently cloned in 1991 [2,3]. HEV

49

contains a small nonenveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome approximately

50

7,200 nucleotides long [4]. HEV is an etiological agent of hepatitis E in humans. Similar to

51

hepatitis A, the vast majority of HEV infections are asymptomatic (especially in children) or

52

cause self-limiting acute liver inflammation, which can resolve within a few weeks without

53

the need for specific treatment [4]. However, immunosuppressed individuals, organ-

54

transplant recipients, hemodialysis patients, and pregnant women are at a high risk of

55

developing life-threatening diseases, including chronic hepatitis and acute liver failure, after

56

infection with HEV [5,6]. It has been estimated that the mortality rates for HEV infections in

57

pregnant women and young people are about 20% and 3%, respectively [7]. The incubation

58

period, which occurs during the prodromal phase, can vary from 2 to 8 weeks, and common

59

symptoms of HEV infection during this period are usually nonspecific and include fever,

60

nausea, vomiting, and malaise [8]. HEV is now recognized as a major public health issue,

61

causing over 20 million infections every year worldwide and accounting for approximately

62

70,000 deaths [1]. Currently, there are eight known HEV genotypes from only one serotype

63

that can infect humans and other animal taxa (HEV-1 to HEV-8), of which HEV-1 and HEV-

64

2 are restricted to humans and are associated with most outbreaks in developing countries in

65

parts of Asia, Central America, and Africa [9]. Genotypes 3 and 4 are typically identified in

66

developed countries, including the USA, New Zealand, Japan, and some countries in Europe,

67

and can be isolated from a broader range of taxa, including humans, pigs, deer, and rabbits.

68

Genotypes 5 and 6 are found in wild boars [8,10]. More recently, a new genotype of camelid

69

HEV (HEV-7) was isolated from dromedary camels in the UAE and some African countries,

70

including Sudan and Egypt [11,12].

71

Fecal-oral transmission is considered the main route of HEV transmission, but other

72

transmission routes have been suggested. This includes person-to-person transmission, such

73

as vertical transmission (mother-to-infant) during delivery. In particular, blood transfusion

74

transmission has become one of the main routes, especially in some low-income countries in

75

Asia [4]. Several studies have reported transfusion-transmitted HEV from blood components

76

in many industrialized countries, including European countries, Australia, and the United

77

States [13-18]. In the Gulf and other neighboring countries, few studies have evaluated the

78

HEV seroprevalence in healthy blood donors. A recent study has indicated that the HEV

79

seroprevalence in Qatar is high among blood donors, i.e., approximately 21% [19]. To the

80

best of our knowledge, the first study of HEV in Saudi Arabia was conducted in 1994 in

81

Riyadh and Gizan, with anti-HEV antibody detection frequencies of 8.4% and 14.9%,

82

respectively [20]. Two additional studies of HEV in Saudi Arabia reported seroprevalences in

83

blood donation samples of 18.7% and 16.9% in Makkah and Jeddah, respectively [21,22]. In

84

most countries, screening is not available for HEV in blood donors. However, in the

85

Netherlands, screening was introduced in 2017, and the United States is now considering

86

HEV screening for blood donors [4]. In this study, we estimated the HEV seroprevalence

87

among blood donors in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia. These results provide a basis for

88

evaluating whether routine screening is necessary in Saudi Arabia.

92

From January to April 2019, 1,078 whole blood samples were collected from

93

volunteer blood donors at the Blood Donor Unit at King Saud Hospital, Unayzah, Saudi

94

Arabia. All study participants provided written informed consent, and the study design was

95

approved by the local research Ethical Committee of the General Directorate of Health

96

Affairs at Qassim Province (approval number: 1441-225162).

Serological testing
Serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies

100

using commercial HEV Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kits (Fortress

101

Diagnostics, Antrim, UK) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The sensitivity and

102

specificity of the assays are 99.5% and 99.6%, respectively [23]. Samples were tested in

103

duplicate and samples yielding borderline results were retested in duplicate to confirm the

104

initial results. Only IgG-positive samples were tested for the presence of anti-HEV IgM.

105
106
107

Statistical analyses
The Chi-square test and Fisher's exact text with the Freeman-Halton extension were

108

used to evaluate the associations between the demographic characteristics of the participants

109

and HEV seroprevalence. All statistical analyses were performed using an online statistical

110

calculator at: (https://www.socscistatistics.com); a two-tailed p-value of 0.05 was considered

111

significant.

153

HEV is a transfusion-transmissible virus, as evidenced by its detection in blood

154

donors in both developed and developing countries [24,25]. In the current study, we screened

155

1,078 serum samples from blood donors in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia for anti-HEV

156

IgG and IgM antibodies. This is the largest study of the seroprevalence of HEV in Saudi

157

Arabia to date with respect to the number of samples obtained from blood donors. Our results

158

indicated that the seroprevalence of HEV in blood donors is 5.7% for IgG and 1.3% for IgM.

159

In addition, we detected a significant difference between Saudis (3%) and non-Saudis

160

(22.1%) in the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG. The seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgM was

161

also significantly higher among non-Saudi blood donors (7.8%) than in Saudi blood donors

162

(only 0.2%). Moreover, we found an increase in the rate of anti-HEV IgG with age. The

163

highest rate of positive anti-HEV IgG results was observed in the 45- to 54-year-old group

164

and the lowest rate was obtained for donors younger than 25 years (Fig 1). These results are

165

consistent with those of a previous study suggesting that age is a risk factor for HEV [26].

166

The anti-HEV IgM seroprevalence was comparable in all age groups other than donors aged

167

over 55 years who tested negative for IgM. Some studies have suggested that the HEV

168

seroprevalence rate increases with age, while other studies have reported that the correlation

169

between age groups and HEV seroprevalence varies [13, 22]. The anti-HEV IgG

170

seroprevalence among blood donors in the Qassim Region was comparable to that in Riyadh

171

(8.4%) but was much lower than estimates for other regions of Saudi Arabia, such as Gizan

172

(14.9%), Makkah (18.7%), and Jeddah (16.9%) [20-22]. Moreover, the seroprevalence of

173

anti-HEV IgG was also lower than that reported in neighboring countries, such as Qatar

174

(20.7%) [19]. This variation in the HEV seroprevalence among studies can be explained by

175

differences in the commercial enzyme immunoassays used to detect HEV antibodies in blood

176

donor samples. Commercial ELISA assays have different sensitivities and specificities,

177

which may lead to variation in estimates of the HEV seroprevalence [23]. For instance, the

178

HEV ELISA kit used in the present study (Fortress Diagnostics) has a sensitivity and

179

specificity of 99.5% and 99.6%, respectively, but the most common ELISA for HEV

180

detection (the Wantai assay) is known for its high antibody detection rates [24]. In addition,

181

these assays may not detect all HEV genotypes. The variation among studies may also be

182

explained by differences in demographic properties, which can vary among cities within the

183

same country. For example, the higher HEV seroprevalence in Makkah and Jeddah compared

184

to other cities in Saudi Arabia could be due to the high number of visitors of different

185

nationalities in these two cities every year for pilgrimages and other religious practices. A

186

potential limitation of the current study is that we could not confirm the presence of HEV

187

RNA in the seropositive donor samples.

188

In summary, we showed that the seroprevalence of HEV is relatively low (5.7% and

189

1.3% for anti-HEV IgG and IgM, respectively) among blood donors in the Qassim Region,

190

Saudi Arabia when compared to those in other regions of the country. The anti-HEV IgG

191

seropositivity was significantly higher in non-Saudi donors (22.1%) than in Saudi donors

192

(3%). Further investigations of the seroprevalence of HEV in a larger sample of blood donors

193

from an expanded geographical distribution are needed to determine the need for HEV

194

screening for blood donors in Saudi Arabia.
