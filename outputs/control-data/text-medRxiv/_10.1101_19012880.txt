Abstract
Background
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses highdose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body.
Recently, stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias (stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation STAR), with promising results reported in patients with refractory, scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT), a
cohort with known high morbidity and mortality.
Objective
Herein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator
stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning
software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results.
Methods
This is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for
radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morphology, electroanatomical mapping, and studyspecific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the
aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by
CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were
monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety.
Results
Five patients (100 % male, 63 ± 12 years old, 80 % ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection
fraction 34 ± 15 %) with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was
delivered in 82 ± 11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12 ± 2 months, all
patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence; two patients
died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging
evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the
scar targeted by radioablation.
Conclusion
Despite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in
a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be
favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to
explain these disappointing results.

Introduction
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses highdose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. In
contrast to traditional radiotherapy which functions by disrupting cellular division, radiosurgery works by
creating radiation-induced necrosis.1 Stereotactic radiosurgery is currently used for treatment of various
types of tumors in the head and neck, lung, abdomen, pelvis and spine, with good local control rates and
minimal side effects.2 Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation (STAR) is the application of stereotactic
radiosurgery for the non-invasive treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. STAR has been used to homogenize the
scar in patients with structural heart disease and ventricular tachycardia (VT) that is refractory to
antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and has failed radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA), with promising
results.3-10 In this report, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided
linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific
radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to longterm results.

Methods
Patient population
This was a prospective, single-arm, two-center feasibility study of STAR for the treatment of refractory scarrelated VT. Patients referred by an electrophysiologist to our center to be considered for radioablation were
screened and considered for the study if they met all the following criteria: i) presence of an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD); ii) ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with recurrent symptomatic VT
that induced ICD shock(s) despite RFCA and/or AAD therapy; iii) age ≥ 60 years; iv) left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) ≥ 20%. Patients were excluded in case of: i) prior radiation therapy to the chest; ii) active
ischemia or other reversible causes of VT; iii) disease process(es) likely to limit survival to < 12 months; iv)
baseline creatinine levels > 1.5 mg/dL.
In this study, we report the clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in the CardioPlan software feasibility study,
sponsored by CyberHeart (NCT02661048). All patients provided written informed consent and the study
was approved by each participating center's Institutional Review Board.
Radioablation treatment plan
The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on study-specific, pre-procedural imaging with
cardiac computed tomography (CT). The latter consisted of an end-expiration, chin to navel chest CT scan,
with a resolution of 1 to 1.25 mm axial slices, and contrast with maximal enhancement at the level of the
pulmonary veins. CT imaging was performed after placement of a transjugular temporary active fixation
pacing lead (Oscor PY58PV in the first three patients, Medtronic 5076-58 in the last two) in the right
ventricular septal area, which served as the fiducial marker to dynamically track respiratory motion during
delivery of radiotherapy (see below). To confirm that the area of myocardial thinning identified on contrast
enhanced first-pass CT was the clinical arrhythmogenic target, it was correlated with low voltage areas seen
on electroanatomical mapping performed during previous RFCA along with the site of origin (exit) of the
clinical VT morphology on the 12-lead ECG.
The 3-dimensional contours of the myocardial substrate to be targeted by radioablation were at first
created by the electrophysiologist with the CardioPlan software (CyberHeart, Portola Valley, CA, USA;
Figure 1). This target, also referred to as the clinical target volume (CTV), included the whole transmural
myocardium encompassing the scar. A margin of around 3 mm was added to the CTV to account for its
motion relative to the cardiac cycle, thus defining the internal target volume (ITV). In addition, a contour of
surrounding normal organs (organs at risk, OAR) was also delineated to define their relationship with the
CTV. OAR taken into consideration for ventricular STAR included the mitral valve, coronary arteries outside
of the scar, lung, large bronchi, esophagus, great vessels, stomach, liver, bowels, skin, and spinal cord. The
ITV and OAR delineated with CardioPlan as well as raw CT images were then transferred to the MultiPlan
Treatment Planning Software for Cyberknife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), in which the final target volume
(or, planning target volume - PTV) was refined by the radiation oncologist, in collaboration with the
electrophysiologist and nuclear medicine, to account for set-up uncertainties (Figure 1). For OARs, predefined radiation dose and volume limits were applied to minimize the probability of radiation-related
toxicity, following Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommendations based on published
reports and radiobiological models for Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP).11

Radioablation procedure
The final treatment plan was then transferred to a 6-MV linear accelerator (CyberKnife G4 system with an Iris
variable aperture collimator) and the patient treated with a prescription dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single
fraction to the PTV. CyberKnife is a frameless, image-guided radiotherapy delivery system in which the
linear accelerator is mounted on a multijointed robotic arm able of aiming highly focused 6-MV radiation
beams with six degrees of freedom (Figure 2).12 To accurately deliver radiotherapy, CyberKnife is equipped
with a set of orthogonal X-ray sources, which acquire periodical images throughout treatment duration to
monitor the position of the patient and locate the target within, adjusting for movements. For STAR,
radiation was delivered using two motion tracking systems: X-Sight Spine Tracking System and Synchrony
Respiratory Tracking. The former enables tracking of skeletal structures of the spine for accurate patient
positioning, accounting for static rotational alignment.13 The latter creates a real-time model that correlates
the motion of the fiducial marker placed near the PTV to the motion of the chest wall, accounting for
dynamic (respiration-related) translational aligment.14

The radiation treatment was performed in an outpatient setting without anesthesia. Mild sedation was
allowed, per patient request. During the procedure, the ICD was temporarily programmed to "monitor
only" to prevent inappropriate shocks; pacing settings were left unchanged. At the end of the procedure,
the fiducial temporary pacing lead was removed by the electrophysiologist and the ICD interrogated to
ensure proper function and tachycardia therapies programmed back to their original settings.
For each treatment plan, the following metrics were taken into consideration:15
• dosimetry:
o minimum dose, mean dose, and maximum dose
prescription isodose: % of the maximum dose chosen to be delivered at the periphery of the PTV
• quality of target coverage
o percentage target covered (PTC): % of the PTV covered by the chosen prescription dose)
o

o

conformity index (CI): prescription isodose volume (PIV - or, volume that receives the chosen
prescription dose)/PTV; and new conformity index (nCI): PIV*PTV/(volume of the PTV covered by PIV)2

o

homogeneity index (HI): maximum dose/prescription dose

In simpler terms, CI and nCI (the latter better suited for non-symmetrical PTVs) describe the degree to
which the volume that receives the chosen prescription dose conforms to the shape and size of the PTV,
thus expressing the amount of healthy tissue dose, whereas HI measures the uniformity of dose within the
PTV (Figure 3).

Follow-up
After radioablation, patients underwent clinical follow-up was scheduled at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3
months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year, at which times they were evaluated for ventricular arrhythmias
control (efficacy) and serious clinical events (safety). Arrhythmia control was evaluated by looking at freedom
from ventricular arrhythmias and number of AADs required at follow-up.
Ventricular arrhythmia recurrence was defined as presence of VT/ventricular fibrillation receiving appropriate
ICD treatment (shock and anti-tachycardia pacing) or documented by ECG/device intracardiac recordings

for VTs below the programmed device cut-off. ICD follow-up was performed via remote monitoring in 3/5
patients, while interrogations performed at the time of the clinical follow-up visits and hospitalizations were
used in the remaining 2 patients. An electrophysiologist adjudicated all VT episodes (ICD interrogations/
ECG). Of note, ICD programming was kept consistent before and after the STAR procedure. AADs
prescribed at follow-up were either continued at the same dose, continued at a reduced dose, or
discontinued per the treating electrophysiologist.
To assess safety, patients were monitored clinically and with serial imaging for serious thoracic adverse
events, with particular attention for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for

Results
Between January and June 2018, 6 patients were screened and enrolled in the study in one center. One
patient was subsequently excluded due to pre-existing chronic renal failure, with inability to undergo serial
CT imaging with contrast at follow-up. Five patients underwent STAR, their demographic and clinical
characteristics are outlined in Table 1. An enrollment exception was made for two patients aged < 60 years
old, one of which experienced recurrent sustained symptomatic VT episodes below the ICD therapy cut-off.
All patients were males, with a mean age of 63±13 years. The underlying cardiomyopathy was ischemic in 4
(80%), with a mean LVEF of 34±15 %. All patient had scar-related VT refractory to RFCA (scar
homogenization), taking an average of 2 (1-2) AADs at the time of enrollment (all having failed amiodarone
therapy). Of note, 3 out of 4 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy underwent prior sternotomy, which
prevented epicardial RFCA.

Characteristics of the procedure, including the location of the targeted scar and associated delivery
efficiency values are in Table 2, whereas detailed data on dosimetry and quality of target coverage are in
Table 3. The mean volume of the PTV was 143 ± 50 mL, treated using a mean of 185 ± 48 non-zero beans
and 24942 ± 2773 MU over 82 ± 11 minutes. The mean radiation dose delivered to the PTV ranged
between 2450 and 2828 cGy, with a mean of 2686 cGy. This dose was prescribed to a 74-80 (mean 77) %
isodose line, covering 82 ± 17 % of the PTV. The maximum and minimum dose ranged between 3125 and
2278 (mean 3242) cGy, and 719 and 2076 (mean 1474) cGy, respectively. Mean CI, nCI, and HI were 1.17,
1.50, and 1.30, respectively. STAR was uneventful, and all patients were discharged home the same day
without acute procedure-related complications, including normal ICD generator and lead function.

Clinical follow-up ranged from 10 to 14 months, with a mean of 12 ± 2 months. Efficacy results are outlined
in Figure 4 and Table 4. Four patients had a marked reduction in ventricular arrhythmia burden during the
first 6 months following the procedure, as evidenced by the reduction of VT episodes (both requiring ICD
intervention and monitored) and an overall trend in reduction/discontinuation of the baseline AAD. After
doing well, thus reducing the AAD dose, patient #5 experienced clinically significant VT recurrence at 3
months, requiring repeated ICD interventions (both shocks and ATP). This patient had a septal scar, which
was sub-optimally covered by irradiation (61% PTC) given the vicinity of the atrio-ventricular node. By the
end of follow-up, all patients had clinically significant VT recurrence requiring reinstatement of previously
tapered down/stopped AAD. Moreover, 3 patients underwent repeat RFCA. Of note, at the time of redo,
there were areas of surviving myocardium well within the dense scar that was part of the putative PTV. In
patient #2, where the electroanatomical voltage maps performed before and after STAR were available for
comparison, we also observed an increase of the scar area beyond the boundaries of prior ablation (Figure
5).

There was no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in
the OAR. Of note, due to non-compliance, imaging follow-up was not complete in patient #2 (6- and 9months scheduled exams; 12-months TTE), patient #3 (12-months chest CT scan), and patient #5 (9-months
CXR). These patients underwent scheduled imaging follow-up at 18 months (consisting of CXR, TTE and
chest CT scan), which confirmed absence of radiation-induced complications in the OAR. LVEF remained
stable throughout follow-up in 3 patients, with a transient reduction noted in patient #3 and #5. In the
former, the 12-month TTE showed a LVEF of 30% (baseline 55%): this exam was performed at the time of
his VT recurrence (failed ATP, with degeneration to VF, requiring 3 shocks for termination), and LVEF
improved back to baseline by the 18-month TTE follow-up. In the latter, the 9-months TTE showed a smaller
reduction of LVEF (35%, baseline 45%), which returned to baseline by the time of the 12-month TTE followup. Two patients (patient #1 and #4) died at 10 and 12 months after the procedure due complications
related to their advanced heart failure; no autopsy was performed.

Discussion
This prospective pilot study demonstrates that, despite good initial results, STAR with CyberKnife did not
result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of
patients with scar-related VT.
Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation
Scar homogenization with RFCA is widely used to treat VT, however there are some anatomical constraints
(i.e. deep myocardial origin, unattainable epicardial access) that are known to hinder its efficacy. In addition,
RFCA is associated with a significant number of possible procedure-related complications (such as vascular
and myocardial injury, embolism, radiation exposure, myocardial ischemia and heart failure), with further
limit its application to fragile patients. Thus, patients continuing to have VT who fail or who are unsuitable
for RFCA and AADs have limited options. Among the alternative approaches used in clinical practice to
overcome these limitations, STAR has recently emerged with promising results.3–10 STAR is the application of
stereotactic radiosurgery in cardiac arrhythmias. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a non-invasive technology that
has been successfully used to treat a variety of solid tumors in the head and neck, lung, abdomen, pelvis
and spine, with good local control rates and minimal side effects.2 Stereotactic radiosurgery consists of one
fraction of very high-dose radiotherapy delivered to the target with submillimeter. The mechanism of injury
is postulated to be a combination of vascular injury (leading to tissue hypoxia and necrosis) and apoptotic
cell death (resulting in fibrosis and scar formation), which occur over days to months.1 Since this is not a cellspecific effect, it is important to concentrate radiation exposure to the target, with a rapid dose falloff to
minimize toxicity to surrounding tissue. Histologic and physiologic data have shown that stereotactic
radiosurgery is able to create a lesion comparable to the one obtained by RFCA using a dose of 25 to 35
Gy delivered in a single fraction.17–19 STAR is a promising technique, because its eliminates risks of RFCA
and its associated hospitalization. Early reported outcomes show no procedural-related complications and a
decreased arrhythmia burden at follow-up, but additional clinical experience is needed to further define its
efficacy and safety.
Efficacy
In this pilot study, STAR performed with CyberKnife, resulted in an initial decrease in ventricular arrhythmia
burden in all patients, but significant recurrence was ineluctable by the end of the 1-year follow-up. It is not
easy to explain these disappointing results, but we can hypothesize biological, technical and clinical
reasons, which could have – alone or in synergy – influenced the outcomes.
Biological considerations
While 25 Gy is the dose used in current clinical studies, pre-clinical dose studies have shown that doses >
30 Gy to the PTV are required to achieve consistent scar formation at 6 months.20,21 Underdosing might
have led to an initial beneficial effect due to acute (vasogenic and cytokine-release related) edema, but
recurrence in the long term due to lack of uniform myocardial cell death.22 However, given the current
technical limitations (see below), delivering higher target doses while trying to spare the surrounding organs
might be not safe, and longer term safety outcomes are necessary before dose escalation. It is also possible
that a dose of 25 Gy is adequate, but longer times (> 12 months) are required for transmural scar formation
in a tissue mostly composed of terminally differentiated cells, yielding to a higher arrhythmic risk in the mid
to long term, during which increased AAD coverage might be necessary. While early (< 3 months) histology
examination on human hearts after STAR using 25 Gy has shown no to mild acute inflammatory changes,

longer term data are missing.5,10 Given these uncertainties, we believe that formal assessment of lesion
formation (i.e. serial EAM, biopsy, MRI/CT) on the irradiated myocardial tissue should be incorporated in
future human studies to better understand the dynamics of the biological effects of radioablation and more
precisely determine the appropriate dosing protocols to optimize safety and efficacy.
Technical considerations
Suboptimal radiation coverage is possible, as the myocardial scar is a challenging target for stereotactic
radioablation: i) it is not accurately defined by current imaging techniques, ii) it is asymmetrical, and ii) it has
complex motion, all while being surrounded by various radio-sensitive organs.
As for the first point, we treated the myocardial scar as defined by areas of myocardial thinning on contrast
enhanced first-pass CT correlating with low voltage areas on electroanatomical mapping along with the
clinical VT morphology on the 12-lead ECG. Each technique has its limitations, such as inability to detect
the border zone, presence of multiple non-scar related factors affecting local voltage, or localization of exit
vs critical isthmus sites.23,24 While we chose this approach to integrate anatomical and functional
information, it might not accurately define the true anatomical extent of the clinically relevant
arrhythmogenic substrate to be translated into the radiosurgical target.
Secondly, while contouring was facilitated by CardioPlan, which provided 3-dimensional images and
volumes to work with, there are still some challenges associated with the asymmetrical nature of the scar.
That is, it is harder to provide uniform irradiation with minimal spillage of significant doses to the
surrounding healthy OAR, as evidenced by the non-ideal (> 1) HI and nCI of our treatment plans.15 Indeed,
in the 2 patients who underwent repeat RFCA, there was evidence of incomplete ablation within the dense
scar, with fragmented and delayed potentials noted in tissue well within the irradiated volume.
For the last technical notion, movement of the target results in either the target receiving less than the
prescribed dose or the surrounding OAR receiving an additional, unnecessary dose. To avoid the latter, we
have followed strict dose limit guidelines, which de facto led to inadequate radiation dosing in 2/5 patients,
in whom only about 60% of target was irradiated with 25 Gy. As for the former, the myocardial scar lies in an
organ that is constantly moving, itself and within the chest. While there are several techniques to properly
follow radiosurgical targets that move along the respiratory cycle, little is known as to how to properly
manage cardiac motion. In the current study, we used Synchrony to track the scar in real time: acquiring
serial orthogonal X-rays of the fiducial lead located near the target coupled with chest wall motion
determined by an optical tracking system, the beam of irradiation moved to coincide with scar throughout
the respiratory cycle. Indeed, compared to previous reports, we did not we did not observe inflammatory
changes in the surrounding lung parenchyma, possibly signifying a more targeted radioablation with
CyberKnife vs other radiotherapy delivery systems.5 However, it is possible that by improving the safety
profile, arrhythmic outcomes were affected due to more intramyocardial delivery of subtherapeutic doses.
As for cardiac motion, we did not have any good real-time indicator to track myocardial movement (i.e.
contractility), which was accounted for just by adding a 3 mm margin to the CTV, the static anatomical
target that includes the transmural myocardium encompassing the scar. Indeed, previous four-dimensional
imaging studies have shown that both the left atrial and ventricular myocardium display significant
volumetric, positional and morphological variations throughout the cardiac cycle.25–27 Therefore, the lack a
direct, real-time, patient-specific internal margin might have led to inadequate/non-uniform irradiation,
despite good planned dosimetry and target coverage parameters. This effect is expected to be more
pronounced in the periphery of the irradiated volume (penumbra), with an incomplete, non-transmural

ablation maturing over time. To support this, in the 2 patients with repeat RFCA, there was also evidence of
extension of the scar beyond what was seen in the RFCA preceding radiotherapy. The surviving myocardial
tissue as well as the newly maturated border zone are highly arrhythmogenic, leading to VT storm after a
period of adequate ventricular arrhythmia control.
Clinical considerations
On a clinical standpoint, this is a cohort of patients with advanced heart failure: indeed, 2 patients died of
worsening heart failure in the course of follow-up. This is a high-risk population, in which the
arrhythmogenic myocardial substrate is large and has already proven to be refractory to available
treatments addressing the etiology (anti-ischemic drugs or interventions in the case of ischemic
cardiomyopathy), progression (anti-remodeling drugs) and consequences (AADs and RFCA with scar
homogenization) of the underlying disease.28 Scar progression is expected in this population, and can
explain the formation of new arrhythmogenic substrate, which can lead to new ventricular arrhythmias,
despite good early outcomes.29
Safety
Finally, we have not observed any acute or early radiation related complications, confirming previous
reports using the same dosing protocol (i.e. 25 Gy in a single fraction). Peri-procedural risks are typically
extremely low due to the non-invasive nature of treatment. All patients were treated in an outpatient
setting, with no complaints or complications. More specifically, we have not observed any ICD generator or
lead malfunction, which confirm previous reports of safe irradiation of cardiac hardware up to relatively high
energies (> 10 MV).30 As for late radiation-necrosis complications, by applying the RGOT validated dose
limits, we have not observed any clinical or imaging evidence of significant injury to the OAR up to 1 year of
follow-up. However, since late radiation injury risk to the OARs is not only dose dependent, but also reflects
the tissue-specific vulnerability, longer surveillance is necessary to confirm this favorable safety profile. As
for the transient reduction of LVEF noted in two patients, it can be explained by stunning secondary to the
concomitant VT recurrence and ICD shock and mild variation within the natural history/interobserver
agreement boundaries. As other patients in our and other reported series had stable LVEF throughout their
follow-up, a transient reduction due to radiation injury is less likely, but still possible.8,9 More data are
necessary to exclude this potential time-dependent adverse effect.
It is also important to note that placement of a temporary lead is an added, albeit small, risk to the
procedure. The temporary lead is required for respiratory tracking of the PTV with Synchrony, which requires
internal markers for accurate dynamic tracking.14 In prior studies, we’ve found that the ICD lead tip is not
accurately tracked by Synchrony due to artifacts created by the near right ventricular coil.31 On the other
hand, the temporary lead is a simple active fixation lead which creates minimal imaging artifacts, and as
such is well tracked by Synchrony. The right ventricular septal area is chosen to avoid tracking interference
from the patient’s existing ICD lead and to be as close as possible to the target. Of note, three of our
patients did have an existing cardiac resynchronization therapy left ventricular lead: dedicated planning
study are needed to validate their use for Synchrony tracking, which would remove the need of a temporary
lead.

Conclusion
Despite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in
a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile of STAR was confirmed to
be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during the first year of follow-up. Further
studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.
