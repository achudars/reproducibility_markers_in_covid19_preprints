ABSTRACT
Aims
Point-of-care (POC) tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) offer the
potential to improve patient management and antimicrobial stewardship. Studies have
focused on performance; however, no workflow assessments have been published
comparing POC molecular tests. This study compared the Liat and ID Now systems
workflow, to assist end-users in selecting an influenza and/or RSV POC test.

Methods
Staffing, walk-away, and turnaround time (TAT) of the Liat and ID Now systems were
determined using 40 nasopharyngeal samples, positive for influenza or RSV. The ID Now
system requires separate tests for influenza and RSV, so parallel (two instruments) and
sequential (one instrument) workflows were evaluated.

Results
The ID Now ranged 4.1–6.2 minutes for staffing, 1.9–10.9 minutes for walk-away and 6.4–
15.8 minutes for TAT per result. The Liat ranged 1.1–1.8 minutes for staffing, 20.0–20.5
minutes for walk-away and 21.3–22.0 minutes for TAT. Mean walk-away time comprised
38.0% (influenza positive) and 68.1% (influenza negative) of TAT for ID Now and 93.7%
(influenza/RSV) for Liat. The ID Now parallel workflow resulted in medians of 5.9 minutes
for staffing, 9.7 minutes for walk-away, and 15.6 minutes for TAT. Assuming prevalence of
20% influenza and 20% RSV, the ID Now sequential workflow resulted in medians of 9.4
minutes for staffing, 17.4 minutes for walk-away, and 27.1 minutes for TAT.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory tract infections are a major public health issue and significant cause of morbidity
and mortality worldwide.[1] Influenza virus [2, 3] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [4-6]
are significant causes of respiratory illness and have overlapping clinical symptoms and
seasonality.
Influenza is characterized by fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise,
sore throat, and runny nose.[2] It can affect people of all ages, although some groups are
at greater risk of severe disease or complications (young children, pregnant women, the
elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions, and those with immunosuppressive
conditions).[2] Influenza virus types A and B are responsible for annual epidemics estimated
to cause 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths worldwide.[2]
RSV is typically associated with mild symptoms in adults, including runny nose, cough, fever,
and wheezing,[4] but is known to cause more serious illness in infants and older adults,
including bronchiolitis and pneumonia.[4] RSV is a common cause of childhood acute lower
respiratory infection, and was estimated, in 2015, to have caused 3.2 million hospital
admissions and 59,600 in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years globally.[5] In
the same year, there were an estimated 336,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 in-hospital
deaths due to RSV-associated acute respiratory infection in older adults.[6]
However, in adults, RSV is likely to be under-reported as the symptoms are similar to those
of influenza, making it “nearly impossible” to distinguish the two infections by clinical
presentation alone.[7] A recent study assessing laboratory-confirmed hospitalized RSV cases
in the US found that only 44% had RSV-specific International Classification of Diseases
discharge codes (in the first nine positions), suggesting that administrative data
underestimate adult RSV-related hospitalizations.[8] Furthermore, studies suggest that
antibiotic use, morbidity, and mortality are higher among RSV-positive than influenza-

positive adult hospitalized patients [9-11] and RSV patients are more likely to need hospital
re-admission.[12]
Increased detection of RSV would be valuable, not only for appropriate management of
patients but also to minimize transmission to high-risk groups. Reducing the time to
detection of influenza and RSV could improve infection control and reduce in-hospital costs
by improving the efficiency of patient triage and minimizing the time patients are kept in
isolation while waiting for test results.[13] A fast and highly accurate diagnosis could also
enable time-critical antivirals to be administered sooner [14] and reduce inappropriate
antimicrobial administration.[15]
The recent introduction of point-of-care (POC) molecular tests for RSV and influenza A/B
offers the potential for clinicians to have rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results
for these infections.[16, 17] These include the ID Now™ RSV assay and the ID Now™
Influenza A & B assay for use on the ID Now™ (formerly referred to as Alere™ i) system
(ID Now), and the cobas Influenza A/B & RSV assay for use on the cobas Liat PCR

System (Liat). To date, comparison studies have focused on performance based on the
sensitivity and specificity of the ID Now and Liat assays.[18, 19] Differences between the
two systems in terms of test operation or workflow have been mentioned but have not been
the focus of the studies.[19, 20]
The two systems differ in terms of the manual steps involved, turnaround times (TAT), and
multiplexing capabilities, which may impact choice of instrument for influenza and RSV
testing. To further help clinicians and laboratory directors select their influenza and RSV
testing methods, this study aimed to assess the workflow and ease of use of the ID Now
and Liat systems. Specific features that were considered include TAT, staffing time, walkaway time, and the early call-out feature of the ID Now system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design
Influenza A/B and RSV tests were run on the ID Now and Liat systems. For the ID Now
system, sequential and parallel workflow modes were assessed because two tests (influenza
A/B test and RSV test) are required to detect all three viruses. The tests were run by four
trained operators, each working four 4-hour shifts (two shifts per day over two consecutive
days). An independent time motion expert measured TAT and operator staffing and walkaway times. All operators spent at least 1 day using both systems before the ease of use
and workflow testing to ensure the data captured routine use not initial use. All testing was
conducted at TriCore Reference Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA) in November
2018.

Samples
Forty positive residual de-identified nasopharyngeal samples, previously collected for routine
clinical care, were used for this study. The samples were all positive for either influenza A,
influenza B or RSV according to routine laboratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing
and had been frozen after all of the standard of care (SOC) testing was complete. Ten
samples were provided for testing in a random order for each 4-hour shift (four positive for
influenza A, two positive for influenza B, and four positive for RSV). Each sample was tested
for all three viruses using the workflow modes described below. Sample volumes used were
200 μL for each ID Now assay (400 μL total) and 200 μL for the Liat influenza A/B and RSV
assay. Two controls for each assay were run for each reagent lot.

Assays and instruments
The testing used the ID Now Influenza A & B 2 assay and the ID Now RSV assay performed
on the ID Now system (Abbott Diagnostics, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) and the cobas
Influenza A/B & RSV assay for use on the cobas Liat PCR System (Roche Molecular
Diagnostics, Pleasanton, California, USA).

The ID Now system uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology and the Liat
system uses PCR to detect specific nucleic acid sequences. The ID Now influenza A/B assay
detects and differentiates influenza A and influenza B, and the ID Now RSV assay detects
RSV. The Liat influenza A/B and RSV assay detects and differentiates influenza A, influenza
B and RSV from a single sample. All three assays are Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA)-waived in vitro diagnostic tests.[21-23]

Workflow modes
The ID Now sequential workflow involved one operator running the ID Now influenza A/B
assay followed by the ID Now RSV assay. The ID Now parallel workflow involved one
operator running both ID Now assays at the same time on two separate instruments. Both
workflows were evaluated to consider the different methods clinical sites may use to execute
both tests. Each sample was run twice on the ID Now system, once in a parallel workflow
and once in a sequential workflow shift. The Liat influenza A/B and RSV assay is a multiplex
test that provides results for influenza A, influenza B and RSV from one sample run;
therefore, multiple workflows were not required. However, each operator still ran through
two Liat shifts so that they interacted equally with both systems.

Analyses
TAT, staffing time and walk-away time (mean, median, and range) were determined for the
ID Now and Liat systems for all workflows. TAT was the total time from the point when the
initial set-up began to when the test result was released. Staffing time corresponded to the
sum of the labor time (hands-on time) and oversight time (time that the operator was not
directly engaged with the testing but had to remain close to the instrument). Walk-away
time corresponded to the wait times when the operator was not required to be close to the
instrument.

The ID Now system has an early call-out feature for positive test results. Therefore, for ID
Now, TAT, staffing time, and walk-away time were calculated separately for positive and
negative results. The early call-out feature does not guarantee that all positive results
terminate early so waiting the full run time is still required. The Liat system does not have
an early call-out feature and one test covers all three viruses, therefore, all results were
combined for the Liat analyses.
The impact of early call-out on the average TAT, staffing and walk-away times in a realworld clinical setting was estimated by analyzing the expected median TAT, staffing and
walk-away times based on different influenza and RSV prevalence levels.
Expected median time for prevalence ranging from 5% (0.05) to 30% (0.3) was calculated
as follows:
Prevalence expressed as a decimal*median time (TAT/staffing/walk-away) for a
positive result + (1-prevalence expressed as a decimal)*median time
(TAT/staffing/walk-away) for a negative result

Ethics
The study was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable US Food and Drug Administration
regulations. The nasopharyngeal specimens used in the study were de-identified by an
honest broker using a Institutional Review Board-approved procedure.

RESULTS
Workflow steps per run
The ID Now system has eight manual steps (opening lid, inserting test base, inserting
sample receiver, removing seal and inserting swab, transferring cartridge to receiver,
transferring cartridge to test base, running test, discarding components) (Figure 1). The

operator must wait for 3 minutes for the system to warm up before inserting the
swab/sample between steps 3 and 4, calculated as staffing time in the analysis.
The Liat system has four manual steps (scanning assay tube and inserting sample, close
tube and scan, inserting assay tube and running test, discarding the tube).

Workflow timings per run
The ID Now workflow timings varied per run by test type (influenza or RSV) and result,
ranging 4.1–6.2 minutes for staffing time, 1.9–10.9 minutes for walk-away time and 6.4–
15.8 minutes for TAT per test (Table 1). The early call-out feature of the ID Now system
was utilized for the study, which resulted in much shorter TAT and walk-away times for
positive results than for negative results (Table 1 and Figure 2). For the ID Now assays, TAT
ranged 6.4–9.6 minutes for positive results and 14.4–15.8 minutes for negative results, and
walk-away time ranged 1.9–4.2 minutes for positive results and 10.0–10.9 minutes for

negative results (Table 1). Overall staffing time for the ID Now assays was comparable for
positive (4.1–6.2 minutes) and negative results (4.1–5.6 minutes) (Table 1), and 31.9–38%
of the TAT for influenza runs (Figure 3a and 3b).
The Liat ranged 1.1–1.8 minutes for staffing time, 20.0–20.5 minutes for walk-away time,
and 21.3–22.0 minutes for TAT for influenza and RSV results (Table 1). The Liat combined
influenza/RSV test and no early call-out feature made results consistent for all testing
scenarios, with staffing time accounting for 6.3% of the TAT (Figure 3c).

Workflow timings for influenza A/B and RSV
For the ID Now parallel workflow, the median (range) times for all influenza and RSV tests
were 5.9 minutes (5.0–7.4 minutes) for staffing time, 9.7 minutes (9.4–11.1 minutes) for
walk-away time, and 15.6 minutes (14.7–16.8 minutes) for TAT. However, for the ID Now
system, the early call-out for positive results means that test results will influence TAT.
When assessing ID Now negative results only, the parallel workflow median TAT was shorter
(15.1 minutes) compared with the sequential workflow (30.0 minutes) (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Breakdown of test timings for negative results (median times in

RSV, respiratory syncytial virus

For the ID Now sequential workflow in a real-world setting, the prevalence of influenza and
RSV will be a key determinant of TAT. As a result, the data were used to make a theoretical
calculation of TAT (Table 2), as well as staffing time and walk-away time (Table 3).
Expected median TAT for the ID Now influenza A/B and RSV assays (sequential workflow)
ranged from 25.6 minutes for a prevalence of 30% for each virus to 29.3 minutes for a

prevalence of 5% for each virus (Table 2). The walk-away time for the same prevalence
range was 16.0–19.7 minutes (Table 3). Staffing time remained consistent at 9.4 minutes
for all prevalence ranges. For influenza alone, the median TAT was also calculated for the ID
Now assay, which ranged from 12.9–14.7 minutes based on a prevalence range of 30–5%
(Table 4). For the Liat influenza A/B and RSV assay, infection prevalence had no impact on
expected median TAT, staffing time, or walk-away time. In addition, the Liat per run
workflow timing is identical to the influenza A/B and RSV workflow because of the threeanalyte test.

Discrepant results
There were discrepant results between the sequential and parallel workflow ID Now results
for four samples in this study. Two samples (Sample IDs: 404-125 and 404-136) that were
positive for influenza A under the sequential workflow were negative for influenza A/B and
RSV under the parallel workflow, and two samples (Sample IDs: 404-128 and 404-133) that
were negative for influenza A/B and RSV under the sequential workflow were positive for
RSV under the parallel workflow. For the Liat system, test results for all 40 samples matched
their original results for all tests during this study.

DISCUSSION
The ID Now and Liat systems offer different workflow options for rapid diagnosis of
influenza A/B and RSV in POC settings such as emergency rooms, urgent care centers,

physician offices, and pharmacies. The median times reported in our study indicate that the
ID Now sequential workflow has the longest TAT for influenza and RSV testing (up to 30
minutes) followed by the Liat system (21.6 minutes), and that the ID Now parallel workflow
has the shortest TAT (15.1 minutes). The Liat has reduced staffing time (1.4 minutes
compared with 5.9 (parallel)–9.3 (sequential) minutes) and increased walk-away time due to
fewer manual steps compared with both ID Now workflows. The early call-out feature of the
ID Now system enables shorter TATs for positive results compared with negative results (7.5
minutes vs 15.1 minutes).
When selecting the most appropriate diagnostic tool for influenza and RSV testing, it is
critical to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of each testing method. The ID
Now and Liat systems each have their own potential benefits but these need to be
considered in the context of the implementation scenario/setting. Specific factors to consider
include location of instruments (e.g. whether they will be in a separate physician office lab,
how much space is available for instruments), staffing and who will execute the tests (e.g.
whether there will be a dedicated operator available who will stay with the instrument for
the run, whether staff need to be multi-tasking and return to check the instrument).
The Liat system requires less staffing time (sum of hands-on time and oversight time)
(Figure 2) and fewer manual steps (Figure 1) than the ID Now system, providing
advantages in settings without dedicated operators. The Liat system also has a consistent
TAT, which is unaffected by pathogen prevalence. The consistent TAT may enable more
effective planning because the time to results is fixed so that multi-tasking healthcare
workers know when to return to the instrument to record the result. No manual intervention
or operator wait times are required between test initiation and completion so there is not a
risk of the instrument timing out. The Liat system is also multiplexed to detect influenza A/B
and RSV during a single run so only one instrument is required to simultaneously test a
sample for both respiratory viruses.

The ID Now system offers faster TAT compared with the Liat system when using a parallel
workflow. A faster TAT could improve clinical workflow in settings like primary care with
shorter appointment windows during busy winter respiratory seasons. To leverage the faster
TAT of the ID Now, two instruments will be required per patient requiring results, so space
to house instruments should be considered. Utilization of the ID Now system requires a high
level of staffing time via direct interaction and vigilance (Figure 2) during each run so the
availability and added cost of staff to operate the instruments should also be considered.
The system will time out between steps 3 and 4 if the operation is not completed within 10
minutes.
The ID Now’s early call-out feature allows a very fast TAT for positive results. In our study,
results were available at 6.4 minutes (minimum) to 9.6 minutes (maximum) for positive
results and up to 15.8 minutes (maximum) for negative results. For a clinical site to leverage
the workflow benefits of this 6–10-minute TAT, an operator would have to stay close to the
instrument for up to 10 minutes or repeatedly return to check the instrument. As a result,
this feature will provide the most utility in clinical settings with dedicated staff who stay with
the instruments during the entire run or settings where the instruments are placed in the
exam room with healthcare providers, who can monitor the test status during the exam.
In a clinical setting, the majority of samples over the course of a respiratory infections
season are negative; in the US 2018–2019 influenza season the peak influenza prevalence
was ~26%.[24] As a result, the time to receive negative results with the ID Now system
(median 15.1 minutes for influenza) is a closer reflection of median TAT than the earlier
time to positive results (median 7.7 minutes for influenza).
The discrepant results observed in our study with the ID Now system indicate that such
inconsistencies are possible in a clinical setting and should be taken into consideration.
This study provides robust, quantitative workflow data to aid the selection of a POC
molecular test for influenza and RSV; however, there are several limitations that should be

taken into account. This study was not conducted in a real-world clinical setting. The
operators were trained laboratory technicians experienced with using the instruments; the
results may have differed if the users were less experienced. Workflow was assessed using
samples in batches of 10; in the real-world setting, a smaller or larger number may need to
be tested during a working day. Furthermore, the samples used for testing were all positive
for either influenza or RSV and had been previously frozen and thawed, so did not represent
a typical set of clinical samples.

CONCLUSIONS
The ID Now and cobas Liat systems offer different workflow options for emergency rooms,
urgent care centers, physician offices, and pharmacies. When deciding which molecular test
to implement, operational and workflow features should be considered as well as diagnostic
performance/accuracy. Key considerations include the value of having both influenza and
RSV results, staffing capacity, and instrument placement.

Key messages
•

The use of POC NAAT tests for influenza and RSV in outpatient settings is increasing,
offering the ability to improve patient management, infection control, and support
antimicrobial stewardship

•

This study provides data on workflow parameters (TAT, staffing time, and walk-away
time) for the ID Now and cobas Liat systems, which can help to support the selection
of the most appropriate influenza and RSV tests for different implementation
scenarios

•

The cobas Liat System offers a consistent TAT (21.3–22.0 minutes), with 1.4 minutes
of staff time, and multiplexing capabilities so one test can provide influenza A,
influenza B and RSV results

The ID Now system offers TAT ranging 4.4–16.8 minutes, depending on analytes
tested, workflow, and utilization of the early call-out feature, with staff requirements
to stay with the instrument for 4.1–6.2 minutes per run
