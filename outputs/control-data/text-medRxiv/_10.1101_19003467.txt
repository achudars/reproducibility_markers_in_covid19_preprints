Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To describe the patient burden and benefit, and the dynamics
of trial success in the development of ixabepilone—a drug that was approved in
the US but not in Europe.
DATA SOURCES: Trials were captured by searching Embase and
MEDLINE on July 27, 2015.
STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion: 1) primary trial reports, 2) interventional
trials, 3) human subjects, 4) phase 1 to phase 3, 5) trials of ixabepilone in
monotherapy or combination therapy of 6) pre-licensure cancer indications.
Exclusion: 1) secondary reports, 2) interim results, 3) meta-analyses, 4)
retrospective/observational studies, 5) laboratory analyses (ex vivo tissues), 6)
reviews, 7) letters, editorials, guidelines, interviews, abstract-only and poster
presentations.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were independently doubleextracted and differences between coders were reconciled by discussion.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We measured risk using the
number of drug-related adverse events that were grade 3 or higher, benefit by
objective response rate and trial outcomes by whether studies met their primary
endpoint with acceptable safety.
RESULTS: We identified 39 publications of ixabepilone monotherapy and 23
primary publications of combination therapy, representing 5615 patients and
1598 patient-years of involvement over 11 years and involving 17 different
malignancies. In total, 830 patients receiving ixabepilone experienced objective
tumour response (16%, 95% CI 12.5%–20.1%), and 74 died from drug-related
toxicites (2.2%, 95% CI 1.6%–2.9%). Responding indications and combinations
were identified very quickly; thereafter, the search for additional responding
indications or combinations did not lead to labelling additions. A total of 11
“uninformative” trials were found, representing 27% of studies testing efficacy,
208 grade 3–4 events and 226 patient-years of involvement (21% and 26% of the
portfolio total, respectively). After the European Medicines Agency rejected
ixabepilone for licensing, all further trial activity involving ixabepilone was
pursued outside of Europe.
DISCUSSION: Risk/benefit for patients who enrolled in trials of nonapproved indications of ixabepilone did not improve over the course of the drug’s
development. Clinical value was discovered very quickly; however, a large
fraction of trials were uninformative.

Introduction
In cancer, approximately one in twenty drugs put into phase 1 testing is ultimately licensed.1 The
success rates for clinical approval in the first, second and third indications pursued are 9.0, 8.2
and 6.9%, respectively.2 This high rate of failure results in burdens for patients—particularly
when drugs have substantial toxicity. It also taxes research systems, and indirectly, healthcare
systems. Increasingly, research sponsors, policymakers, and drug developers are seeking ways of
reducing burdens and improving the efficiency of developing new drugs.
In a previous investigation of the targeted drug sunitinib, we found that rapid licensure led to
a dramatic expansion in activities aimed at extending the sunitinib label to other indications.
However, much of this later exploratory activity appeared to be duplicative, and risk/benefit
worsened as drug developers attempted to extend sunitinib to other indications.3
To better explore the dynamics of risk, benefit and success in cancer drug development, we
investigated the development of a non-targeted anticancer drug that was developed around the
same time as sunitinib. Ixabepilone is a semisynthetic analog of epothilone B.4 Ixabepilone was
first licensed in 2007 by the FDA for second-line monotherapy and combination therapy with
capecitabine in breast cancer.5 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s guidelines
recommended ixabepilone for treatment of HER 2-negative breast cancer,6 and NCCN also made
a Category 2B (lower-level evidence) recommendation of second-line ixabepilone monotherapy
for recurrent, metastatic or high-risk endometrial carcinoma.7 However, ixabepilone was
withdrawn from development in the European market in November of 2008 due to a refused
licensing application to the European Medicines Agency.8

Methods
Our primary goal was to quantify the total patient risk and benefit associated with the
development of ixabepilone as a cancer treatment. We defined a “drug development trial
portfolio” as the complete set of published clinical trials in ixabepilone monotherapy or
combination therapy for oncology for indications that were not approved at the time of trial
launch. Benefit was measured in terms of response to therapy by RECIST criteria, and we used a
number of measures of patient risk and burden, including treatment-related death rate and grade
3–4 serious adverse event rate by CTCAE criteria. Our secondary goals were to track the
evolution of risk and benefit and the relationship between risk/benefit and funding. Because
ixabepilone is licensed for both monotherapy and combination therapy with capecitabine, we
included both monotherapy and combination therapy trials in our analysis. Our analysis included
only trials in non-approved indications for ixabepilone. These methods have been adapted from
our previously published systematic review of sunitinib.3

Literature search
Trials were captured by searching Embase and MEDLINE on July 27, 2015 using variations on
the drug terms “ixabepilone,” “Azaepothilone B”, “Ixempra”, “BMS-247550”, “BMS 247550-1”
and “aza-epothilone B.” These results were combined with exploded MeSH terms including

“randomized controlled trial,” “clinical trials,” and “phase 1” to “phase 3.” The full search
protocol is provided in our appendix.
Publications were screened for inclusion by BC using the following criteria: 1) primary trial
reports, 2) interventional trials, 3) human subjects, 4) phase 1 to phase 3, 5) trials of ixabepilone
in monotherapy or combination therapy of 6) pre-licensure cancer indications. We excluded
publications that were 1) secondary reports, 2) interim results, 3) meta-analyses or systematic
reviews, 4) retrospective or observational studies, 5) laboratory studies of ex vivo human tissues,
6) reviews, 7) letters, editorials, guidelines, interviews, abstract-only publications or poster
presentations.

Extraction
Our extraction template captured variables in the following domains: trial demographics,
methods, hypotheses, trial design, measures of patient risk/burden and benefit (including adverse
events, treatment duration, response and investigator conclusions). Criteria for extraction were
pre-specified in a codebook (see appendix). All studies were extracted independently by two
coders using Numbat software—an open-source meta-analysis management tool developed by
BC.9 Disagreements were reconciled by discussion. When items were missing in reports, the
corresponding author was contacted with 2 queries, with a response rate of 18%. Our codebook is
available upon request.
Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse events (SAEs) defined by Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE)10 were scored conservatively, based on the highest number of events
in a single CTCAE category per trial, since complete and per-patient SAE rates were rarely
reported. Toxicities were only scored if they were defined as probably or definitely treatmentrelated in reports. In cases where the study did not mention whether events were treatmentrelated, these were not included.
The duration of treatment was defined to be the length of time a patient must be enrolled to
collect the primary endpoint. When this number was not explicitly given, duration of treatment
was imputed by the product of the median number of cycles and the period of each cycle.
Patient benefit was calculated in terms of the overall response rate (ORR) in individuals
receiving ixabepilone on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. We used ORR because it is a widely used
surrogate endpoint that allows us to compare effect sizes across trials of different indications and
phases. Indications were divided into clinically meaningful categories identified in consultation
with an oncologist.
A trial was considered to be a “positive” or “nonpositive” based on whether the study reached
its pre-specified primary endpoint, and whether the regime was deemed tolerable by the authors.
A trial was considered to be “uninformative” if any of the following conditions were met: 1) a
nonpositive phase 2 trial was followed up with another trial in the identical patient population
(duplication); 2) a positive phase 2 trial was not followed up with a confirmatory trial, either
published or registered (no follow-up within 7 years of latest enrolment date); 3) a trial failed to
reach 85% or more of its target sample due to factors other than futility or massive benefit
(feasibility). We chose the second criterion on the assumption that phase 2 trials in cancer are
geared towards being sensitive to possible new applications, and supporting a decision to
advance a candidate for further testing. Failure to detect activity under these conditions would

generally indicate an indication is unlikely to respond to a drug. Positive phase 2 trials that are
not followed up are inadequate to guide clinical practice because they use surrogate endpoints
only and/or are statistically underpowered; trials that fail to complete due to severe operational
problems do not adequately address the hypothesis that justified their conduct.

Analysis and Statistics
The rates of change of ORR and SAEs were calculated with R version 3.2.2.11 ORR and SAE
rates were regressed against date of publication, weighted by sample size. We used a two-tailed
test and defined p<0.05 as statistically significant. We did not adjust for statistical multiplicity.
Pooling of responses and SAEs was done using the meta package for R,12 using a DerSimonianLaird random effects model meta-analysis of proportions.
The differences in risk (death rate) and benefit (ORR) between both industry vs non-industry
trials and phase 1 versus phase 2 trials in monotherapy were analyzed in R version 3.2.211 using
a weighted regression analysis. The outcome was regressed on a 0/1 indicator variable to identify
industry trials or phase 1 versus phase 2 trials. The individual trial results were weighted by
sample size, as the inverse variance of a rate estimate is directly proportional to sample size. We
defined p<0.05 to be statistically significant.

Results
Study characteristics
Our search returned 62 primary publications of interventional trials testing ixabepilone in
oncology in indications that were not approved at the time of trial initiation (see appendix). See
Figure 1 for a PRISMA flow diagram and our appendix for details. We captured 39 monotherapy
trials,13-51 and 23 combination therapy trials,52-74 spanning 14 different combination therapies.
Our analyses included trials in indications that were not approved at the time the trial was
initiated. Corresponding authors were based in 7 different countries. Properties of trials in our
sample are described in Table 1.
Using the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) clinical trials registry,
ClinicalTrials.gov, we estimate an additional 20 monotherapy or combination therapy trials were
completed but not published as full-text publications within 4 years of closure (see appendix).
This included another 5 malignancies. Another 35 trials identified in the NLM registry are either
ongoing as of this writing, or may have closed too recently for publication.

Total patient benefit and burden
In total, 830 patients receiving ixabepilone experienced objective tumour response (16%, 95% CI
12.5%–20.1%), and 74 died from drug-related toxicites (2.2%, 95% CI 1.6%–2.9%). We estimate
a minimum of 1276 experienced grade 3–4 drug-related severe adverse events (34.4%, 95% CI
29.9%–39.2%).

The 39 trials included in the ixabepilone monotherapy analysis involved 2504 patients and
546 patient-years of participation over a period of 13 years. Seven different doses of ixabepilone
monotherapy were tested in the translation trajectory of ixabepilone, using 7 schedules and
testing 15 different malignancies.
In monotherapy, 241 patients receiving ixabepilone experienced objective tumour response
(11.1%, 95% CI 8.6%–14.3%); 29 died from drug-related toxicities (2.2%, 95% CI 1.6%–3.0%);
a minimum of 667 experienced grade 3–4 drug-related toxicities (31.3%, 95% CI 25.7%–37.5%).
These figures compare with an ORR of 18.3% (95% CI 11.9%–26.1%) and a SAE rate of 42.9%
(95% CI 34.3%–51.5%) in the CTCAE-defined category (leukopenia) with the highest event rate
in the monotherapy trial cited in the FDA approval.33
In combination therapy, 3111 patients and 1075 patient-years of involvement over 13 years in
9 different countries, testing 14 different combination therapies were sampled. In total, 589
patients experienced objective tumour response (29.6%, 95% CI 22.3%–38.1%), and 45 patients
died from treatment-related toxicity (1.9%, 95% CI 1.1%–3.3%). There was a minimum of 636
grade 3–4 drug-related toxicities (39.4%, 95% CI 32.4%–46.8%). These figures compare with an
ORR of 34.7% (95% CI 29.9%–39.7%) and a severe adverse event rate of 39.1% (95% CI
35.6%–42.6%) in the single CTCAE-defined category (neutropenia) with the highest event rate
in the pivotal combination therapy trial leading to FDA approval.55

Clinical development trajectory
To visualize the progression of testing during ixabepilone development, we prepared
Accumulation of Evidence and Research Organization (AERO) diagrams of all monotherapy and
combination therapy trials (Figures 2 and 3).75 Though the first indication tested (colorectal
cancer) proved nonresponsive, the second (breast cancer) responded and was quickly licensed in
the U.S. Subsequent to licensure, further breast cancer trials tested ixabepilone in and against
different combinations, and with different biomarkers. By 2010, drug developers appeared to
have discontinued testing new indications for ixabepilone monotherapy. The latest unpublished
novel indication pursued according to trial registry records was urethral and bladder cancer,
which closed due to accrual failure in 2007.
Figures 2 and 3 (right panels) show the exploration of combination therapy in 4 different
indications. Ixabepilone was first licensed by the FDA in 2007 for treatment of metastatic or
locally advanced breast cancer in combination with capecitabine after failure of an anthracycline
and a taxane, and in monotherapy after failure of an anthracycline, a taxane and capecitabine.5
Ixabepilone was rejected by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for licensure in 2008.8
Total patient burden in relation to milestones in the development of ixabepilone is depicted in
Figure 4. Dosing and scheduling reflected on the FDA label, as well as responding malignancies,
were discovered with very little patient burden (10 grade 3–4 events; less than 1% of the grade
3–4 events in the total portfolio; 8 patient-years of involvement; less than 1% of 1598 patientyears in trials of non-approved indications). The sharpest incline in cumulative treatment-related
deaths occurred after efficacy in breast cancer was established sufficiently for FDA approval; this
sharp increase represented 29 trials in 15 indications. Most (68%) of the grade 3–4 events and

89% of deaths in the total portfolio of non-approved indications occurred after the first and only
responding indication was identified.
In our AERO diagrams, unfavorable licensing outcomes in Europe appeared to affect the
geography of clinical testing. Before EMA’s rejection, 10 trials were reported as having been
conducted in Europe (these were published after the EMA rejection; see Figures 2–3). After,
there were no further trials that enrolled patients and that included corresponding authors in
Europe. The remainder of the trials pursuing new licenses were performed by corresponding
authors based in North America.

Trends for Risk, Benefit and Success
We plotted the evolution of risk and benefit across the trajectory of ixabepilone development
including mono- or combination therapy trials of indications that were not approved by the FDA
(Figure 5). We did not observe a significant departure from a zero slope in drug-related adverse
event rates (p=0.57). There was a significant departure from a zero slope in ORR (p=0.001), but
this reflects an increase in the exploration of combination therapy, as there was no departure from
a zero slope for studies in monotherapy only (not shown, p=0.9).
Industry-funded studies in indications that had not received FDA licensure at the time of trial
initiation had a higher ORR than non-industry-funded studies (33.9% vs 20.7%, p=0.005), but
the rate of treatment-related death for industry-funded studies was not significantly different
from the rate of non-industry-funded studies (46 out of 1790 patient-subjects, 4.7% vs 23 out of
1856 patient-subjects, 2.3%, p=0.058).
For monotherapy trials in non-FDA-approved indications, phase 2 trials had a higher
response rate, but not significantly so (15.7% vs 10.0%, p=0.2). Rates of treatment-related deaths
were also not significantly different (2.3% vs 3.0%, p=0.9).
A total of uninformative 11 trials were found, 7 for lack of appropriate follow-up, 4 for
accrual failure and 0 for duplicity.22,26,32,46,49,53,61,65,66,74,76 These trials represent 792 patients
and 226 patient-years of involvement in which there was a minimum of 208 grade 3–4 severe
adverse events (27.8%, 95% CI 22.4%–33.9%) and 7 deaths occurred (1.4%, 95% CI 0.8%–
2.7%). Among these patients, 175 experienced objective tumour response (24%, 95% CI 16.7%–
33.3%). The grade 3–4 severe adverse events and patient-years of involvement among the
uninformative trials represent 21% and 26% of the portfolio total, respectively.
The phase 3 trial of endometrial cancer did not meet our criteria for inclusion in our set of
uninformative trials, however it is worth noting because it was launched after a prior phase 2
failure in the same indication and represents 496 patients receiving ixabepilone monotherapy, in
which two patients on the ixabepilone arm died from study drug toxicity.51

Discussion
In a previous characterization of risk, benefit and success rates for the development of the
targeted drug sunitinib, we observed worsening of risk/benefit, exhaustive testing of different
indications, and duplicative nonpositive trials, suggestive of excess burden.3 Our study of the
trajectory of development for ixabepilone—a non-targeted drug—offers parallels and contrasts.

As with sunitinib, ixabepilone developers very quickly discovered conditions for the first
FDA label and with little patient burden. For instance, the second of numerous malignancies
tested in trials of both sunitinib and ixabepilone proved to be the most responsive. As also
observed with sunitinib, most of the burden in testing ixabepilone against non-approved
indications occurred after the first licensed indication, not before. Similarly to sunitinib, returns
of further indication and combination exploration for ixabepilone were steeply and vastly
diminished.
We also found that benefit for phase 2 trials exploring new indications was only slightly
better than benefit levels observed in phase 1 studies (15.7% vs 10.0%, respectively, p=0.2). Risk
of treatment-related death was not significantly different (2.3% vs 3.0%, respectively, p=0.9). A
pattern of worsened risk/benefit in phase 2 studies was observed for sunitinib.
In contrast with the development of sunitinib, we did not observe a worsening of risk/benefit
as the clinical development portfolio of ixabepilone trials matured, nor did we observe as much
perseverance and seeming duplication in testing. Several indications that failed to produce
significant signal of activity in initial phase 2 trials were followed up in subsequent
investigations. Ixabepilone developers were especially persistent in pursuing four indications—
prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and pancreatic cancer.
For example, prostate cancer was tested in 3 monotherapy and 4 combination therapy studies.
The combination studies met their primary endpoints with caveats regarding toxicity and the
need for a decisive phase 3 trial in this indication has been highlighted as early as 2007.77 There
is still no published phase 3 trial, and as of this writing, no U.S. registered phase 3 trial in
prostate cancer. This represents 106 patient-years expended in developing ixabeplione for
prostate cancer that have gone unredeemed insofar as promising findings have not been followed
up with decisive testing. One monotherapy and two combination therapy trials were pursued for
non-small cell lung cancer. Lymphoma showed promising activity in an early phase 2
monotherapy study.36 This was confirmed in a later phase 2 trial, but the authors declared
ixabepilone unlikely to be useful for this indication because of the availability of “numerous”
promising alternatives (e.g. rituximab, which became available soon after this study was
started).46 A nonpositive phase 2 trial of soft tissue sarcoma included a subgroup of 8 responding
patients with leiomyosarcoma.18 This was followed by a trial in uterine leiomyosarcoma; the
study was nonpositive and had lower response rate than the first trial.48 Endometrial cancer was
explored in a phase 2 trial published in 2009. This trial also failed its primary endpoint and was
described by the authors as having only “modest activity of limited duration.”50 Nevertheless, a
phase 3 trial was initiated after the phase 2 was published, in which there were 2 treatmentrelated deaths and 164 drug-related life threatening (grade 3–4) toxicities.51 The National
Comprehensive Cancer Network has made a Category 2B (lower-level evidence)
recommendation of second-line ixabepilone monotherapy for recurrent, metastatic, or high-risk
endometrial carcinoma.7 Our analysis of response rates and severe adverse events for patientsubjects enrolled in trials of non-approved indications of ixabepilone did not reveal a clear trend
in improving or worsening risk/benefit as the translation trajectory matured. This marks a
contrast with sunitinib.

As illustrated in Figure 4, the major burdens for patients enrolling in trials of ixabepilone
were incurred between the initial evidence of efficacy and the rejection by the EMA in November
2008. After this point, research activity for ixabepilone cooled, and the last new indication
explored in a phase 2 trial of ixabepilone was in 2010.42 Some investigators blamed this
regulatory action for difficulty in recruiting patients.76
The study of ixabepilone provided an occasion to explore how trial activities change in
response to regulatory decisions. Trial activities in Europe were discontinued after an
unfavorable licensing decision by the EMA for breast cancer. However, after ixabepilone was
approved in the U.S., drug developers launched a minimum of 11 trials and 5 breast cancer
combination trials. If licensing were being sought for these indications or combinations, these
same trials might have been pursued in Europe as well. One possible explanation for this
geographical shift is that ixabepilone’s developers, calculated that the probability of
demonstrating decisive benefit superior to breast cancer for other indications or drug
combinations was marginal. However, such an explanation invites questions of why so much
testing was pursued in other jurisdictions. Another potential explanation is that some trial
activities that occur after an initial license are primarily aimed at encouraging off-label drug use
or uptake into guidelines, regardless of licensure. Participation in these “seeding” trials can
increase the probability that physicians write prescriptions for a drug,78 and drug companies have
sometimes deliberately used trials to promote off-label drug use.79 As many as 50% of cancer
drug prescriptions in Europe and the U.S. are off-label.80 That ixabepilone was not approved in
Europe foreclosed the prospect of off-label use there. Hence, drug developers may have instead
shifted activities to a jurisidiction where off label use and/or uptake in guidelines was possible.
Nevertheless, this explanation would be very difficult to test absent company documents that are
inaccessible.
Our analysis has several limitations. First, this study relied on published full reports of trials.
Gaps in the literature (unpublished trials, abstract-only publications, etc.) limit our ability to
capture all events and patient responses. However, any publication bias in the ixabepilone
translation trajectory would be unlikely to show a more favourable pattern of risk/benefit. Severe
adverse event rates were not reported consistently. In 30% of studies, serious adverse events were
only reported above a certain threshold; as a result, we have underestimated risk. Second, we
have used response rates as a surrogate for benefit. The relationship between response rate and
clinical benefit is not always clear—as illustrated by the fact that many indications showed
response rates similar to those in trials leading to FDA approval.
In short, based on these findings and the contrasts with sunitinib, we offer the following
hypotheses about risk/benefit for development of novel cancer drugs: First, cancer drug
developers are very effective at using preclinical and early phase clinical trial evidence to
identify the most promising conditions for licensure of a new drug. Few trials, patients-years and
toxicities are needed to achieve a level of activity that can lead to licensure. Second, much of the
risk and burden in drug development occurs after products receive licensure and drug developers
attempt to extend the label. Gains in knowledge about the properties of novel drugs do not seem
to lead to any diminution of event rates, or marked improvements in success, and gains in
clinically useful knowledge diminish sharply after initial licensure. Third, once a drug receives

Figure 3: Ixabepilone monotherapy (left) and combination therapy (right) AERO graph. Trials
arranged by publication year horizontally; stratified by indication vertically. Rectangular nodes
are phase 1 trials. Circular nodes are phase 2 trials. Triangular nodes are phase 3 trials. Nodes are
coloured by ORR divided into quartiles, with separate quartiles for mono- and combination
therapy. White colouration indicates non-efficacy primary endpoint or non-RECIST response
measurement. Dashed borders indicate trials launched in an indication that had already received
FDA licensure (these were not included in our analysis). Asterisks indicate European
corresponding author.

Figure 2: Ixabepilone monotherapy (left) and combination therapy (right) AERO graph. Trials arranged by publication year horizontally; stratified by
indication vertically. Rectangular nodes are phase 1 trials. Circular nodes are phase 2 trials. Triangular nodes are phase 3 trials. Green nodes indicate
positive primary endpoint and acceptable toxicity. Yellow indicates inconclusive primary endpoint. Red indicates negative primary endpoint or unacceptable
toxicity. White indicates non-efficacy endpoint. Dashed borders indicate trials launched in an indication that had already received FDA licensure (these
were not included in our analysis). Asterisks indicate European corresponding author.

Figure 3: Ixabepilone monotherapy (left) and combination therapy (right) AERO graph. Trials arranged by publication year horizontally; stratified by
indication vertically. Rectangular nodes are phase 1 trials. Circular nodes are phase 2 trials. Triangular nodes are phase 3 trials. Nodes are coloured
by ORR divided into quartiles, with separate quartiles for mono- and combination therapy. White colouration indicates non-efficacy primary endpoint or
non-RECIST response measurement. Dashed borders indicate trials launched in an indication that had already received FDA licensure (these were not
included in our analysis). Asterisks indicate European corresponding author.
