Abstract
Background
Rising resistance of HIV-1 to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) threatens the success of the global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to WHOrecommended dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens could reduce this threat due to DTG's high
genetic barrier to resistance.

We used mathematical modelling to examine the impact of the

scale-up of DTG-based ART on NNRTI pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) in South Africa,
2019-2040.

Methods and results
We adapted the MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model, an
epidemiological model of the transmission of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. We modelled the
introduction of DTG in 2019 under two scenarios: DTG as rst-line regimen for ART-initiators,
or DTG for all patients, including patients on suppressive NNRTI-based ART. Due to safety
concerns related to DTG during pregnancy, we assessed the impact of prescribing DTG to all
men and in addition to i) women beyond reproductive age, ii) women beyond reproductive age
or using contraception, and iii) all women.

The model projections show that, compared to

the
continuation
of NNRTI-based
ART,
introducing
DTG
lead
a reduction
in NNRTI

resistance in all scenarios if both ART initiators are started on a DTG-based regimens and those
on NNRTI-based regimens are rapidly switched to DTG. NNRTI resistance would continue to
increase if DTG-based ART was restricted to men. When given to all men and women, DTGbased ART could reduce the level of NNRTI resistance from 58.5% (without DTG) to 14.8% (with
universal DTG) in 2040. If all men and women beyond reproductive age or on contraception are
started on or switched to DTG-based ART, NNRTI resistance would reach 35.1% in 2040.

Conclusions
Our model shows the potential benet of scaling up DTG-based regimens for halting the rise of
NNRTI resistance. Starting or switching all men and women to DTG would lead to a sustained
decline in resistance levels whereas using DTG-based ART in all men, or in men and women
beyond childbearing age, would slow down the increase in levels of NNRTI resistance.

Introduction

1

The rollout of antiretroviral therapy in South Africa is estimated to have prevented 0.73 million

2

HIV infections between 2004 and 2013 as well as 1.72 million deaths between 2000 and 2014

3

[1, 2]. However, the spread of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistant

4

viruses is threatening this success [3]. An estimated 16% of AIDS-related deaths and 8% of ART

5

costs will be attributable to HIV drug resistance up to 2030 in the sub-Saharan African countries

6

that reached HIV pre-treatment drug resistance levels above 10% in 2016 [4].

7

In Southern Africa, dolutegravir (DTG), an integrase inhibitor drug, will be introduced on a

8

large scale as part of xed-dose combinations of Tenofovir, Lamivudine, and Dolutegravir (TLD)

9

[5].

With a high genetic barrier to resistance, DTG has the potential to curb the spread of

10

antiretroviral resistance, as it is highly eective, well tolerated and aordable in resource-limited

11

settings [6, 7, 8, 9].

Mathematical models explored the eectiveness and cost-eectiveness of

12

prescribing DTG to all ART-initiators [10]. These models found that the introduction of DTG

13

was cost-saving and reduced HIV mortality in people living with HIV who initiate ART [10].

14

The introduction of DTG has been complicated by the increased risk of neural tube defects

15

(NTD) in women living with HIV using DTG at the time of conception [11] and other potential

16

side eects such as weight gain [12, 9]. Concerns surrounding NTD risk have delayed the rollout of

17

DTG and, in some settings, led to recommending DTG-based regimens only for men and women

18

who are not at risk of pregnancy [13, 14]. For South Africa, a mathematical modelling study

19

showed that DTG-based rst-line ART for all women of child-bearing potential would prevent

20

more deaths among women and more sexual HIV transmissions than either NNRTI-based ART

21

for women of child-bearing potential or women without contraception, but increase pediatric

22

deaths [15]. In its 2019 guidelines, the WHO recommends DTG in combination with nucleoside

23

reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) for rst-line ART, with the proviso that women should

24

be provided with information about benets and risks to make an informed choice regarding the

25

use of DTG [16].

26

It is likely that in many settings people living with HIV on NNRTI-based rst-line ART will be

27

switched to DTG-based ART, however, the rate of the transition will vary between countries and

28

settings. For second-line ART, WHO recommends DTG-based ART in people living with HIV

29

for whom a NNRTI-based rst-line regimen has failed [16]. Again, the rate of switching to DTG-

30

based second-line ART will vary, inuenced by concerns about the development of dolutegravir

31

resistance in patients who switch with pre-existing resistance to NRTIs [17]. Taken together, it

32

is likely that for the foreseeable future a considerable fraction of people living with HIV, and

33

particularly women, may continue to rely on NNRTI-based ART regimens, even in the case when

guidelines recommend DTG. In this context, NNRTI resistance will likely remain an important

35

issue during and after the rollout of DTG.

36

We adapted the MARISA model (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa)

37

[18] to examine the impact of dierent scenarios regarding the scale-up of DTG-based ART on

38

NNRTI pre-treatment drug resistance (NNRTI resistance in the remaining of this article) in

39

South Africa for 2019-2040.

Extended MARISA model

42

Described in detail elsewhere [18], MARISA is a deterministic compartmental model of both

43

the general HIV epidemic and the NNRTI resistance epidemic in South Africa.

It consists of

44

four dimensions representing i) care stages (see Fig 1), ii) disease progression according to the

45

CD4 cell counts, iii) NNRTI resistance, and iv) gender. Care stages distinguish between infected,

46

diagnosed and treated individuals (either with NNRTI- or protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen),

47

with subsequent treatment-specic suppression (Supp compartment in Fig 1) or failure (Fail

48

compartment). Treat init. compartments represent individuals treated for less than 3 months.

The model dierentiates DTG-eligible from DTG-

We simulated the adapted model from 2005 to 2040 assuming the rollout of DTG-based ART

50

started in 2019 under dierent scenarios (see below). We further assumed that all men and a

51

proportion

p1

of women are eligible for DTG, this proportion varied between scenarios. Before

52

2019, an NNRTI is used in rst-line ART and PIs in second-line regimens. As rst line regimen,

53

DTG is prescribed from 2019 on either to ART initiators (i.e. eligible, ART-naive people living

54

with HIV) or for switching to DTG-based rst-line ART (i.e.

55

people on NNRTI and eligible

for DTG). We assumed that patients failing DTG are switched to a PI-based regimen.

Calibration and extension of the MARISA model

58

We previously calibrated the MARISA model by combining dierent sources of data. Rates either

59

related to treatment response (NNRTI- or PI-based regimen) or disease progression (characterized

60

by CD4 counts) were estimated using clinical data from data from ve cohorts in South Africa

61

(Aurum Institute, Hlabisa, Khayelitsha, Kheth'Impilo and Tygerberg) that participate in the

62

IeDEA collaboration [19].

63

infected adults.

These cohorts provided longitudinal information for 54,016 HIVresistance-

64

related parameters) or tted to estimates from the Thembisa model (e.g. diagnosis rates and

Other parameters were either estimated from the literature (e.g.

65

treatment initiation rates). Thembisa is a demographic projection model on which the ocial

66

UNAIDS estimates for South Africa are based [20]. More details about the calibration procedure

67

can be found in [18] and in the supplementary materials (S1 Text, Section 1.2).

68

We added and modied parameters in order to model the introduction of DTG. We assumed that

69

Î³Dâ†’T 3 (t) is the same as the NNRTI initiation rate Î³Dâ†’T 1 (t) from 2019.

70

Both NNRTI and DTG initiation rates increase until 2022, as a consequence of the Treat-All

71

policy that was implemented in 2017. From 2022 onwards, they are assumed to remain constant

72

the DTG initiation rate

(S1 Text, Section 2.1). Finally, we xed switching rates from NNRTI- to DTG-based regimens

73

for both eligible suppressed (see Scenarios) and all failing individuals (Î³S â†’S (t) and Î³F â†’T (t)

Scenarios

78

The model investigated the impact of the introduction of DTG-based regimens on the level

79

of NNRTI resistance in diagnosed individuals under two main scenarios, with four variations

80

for each of the two scenarios.

81

We also examined the scenario where DTG-based ART is not

introduced. There were thus nine scenarios in total. The two main scenarios were:

82

1. DTG only used in rst-line regimen of ART-initiators and, as second-line, in patients failing
NNRTI-based ART,

83
84

2. DTG used as initial rst-line regimen (for ART-initiators), with all patients on NNRTIbased regimens being switched to a DTG-based regimen.
Each scenario also investigated four dierent DTG eligibility levels

85
86

p1 for women.

The population

eligible for DTG in each scenario was:

87
88

a) only men (100% men, 0% women)

89

b) men and women beyond reproductive age (100% of men, 17.5% of women)

90

c) men and women beyond reproductive age or using contraception (100% of men, 63% of

91

women)

92

d) all men and women (100% of men, 100% of women)

93

The percentages of women eligible for DTG in b) and c) were determined by analyzing cohort

94

data from IeDEA, which show that 17.5% adult women on ART are 50 or older [19], and estimates

95

on the use of contraception from the World Bank [21](see S1 Text, Section 3.1). Of note, to model

96

98

Î³S1 â†’S3 (t) = 0 and Î³F1 â†’T3 (t) =
Î³S1 â†’S3 (t) = Î³F1 â†’T3 (t) = 1 yearâˆ’1 ). We thus assumed

scenario 1., we set

second-line regimens for people failing NNRTI-based rst-line ART.

99

Additional analyses

100

We predicted the impact of dierent levels of DTG introduction on the level of NNRTI failure.

101

We considered the scenario where DTG was prescribed to ART initiators and those on NNRTI-

102

based rst-line ART were switched to a DTG-based regimen, with the four dierent levels of

103

women accessing DTG-based ART (see "Scenarios"). However, we assumed that 99% of women

104

were eligible for DTG in scenario d) (instead of 100%), in order to estimate NNRTI failure when

105

only a very small fraction of women rely on it.

For each of these scenarios, we predicted the

106

percentage of individuals failing an NNRTI-based regimen in dierent calendar years (2025 and

107

2035) and after dierent durations on ART (1 or 2 years). For each of the scenarios, we ran the

108

model from 2005 up to 2035 and retained the numbers of people starting NNRTI-based rst-line

109

ART (by CD4 groups, NNRTI-resistance and gender) in 2025 and 2035. We then ran the model

110

for the compartments related to NNRTI-treatment, using the previously saved starting values.

111

This way, we could predict the levels of NNRTI-failure in patients starting NNRTI in either 2025

112

or 2035 after 1 or 2 years of ART.

113

We assessed the impact of dierent switching rates from NNRTI- to DTG-based regimens, xed
to

1

year

âˆ’1 for both suppressed and failing individuals.

Î³F1 â†’T3 (t)

We varied both rates

Î³S1 â†’S3 (t)

115

within a range corresponding to a time to switch of between 0.5 and 10 years after

116

0%

117

start of ART. For each analysis, the percentage of women who are DTG-eligible varied from
to

114

and

100%.

Sensitivity analyses

119

The values of eight parameters were varied in the sensitivity analysis: three transmission-related

120

parameters (percentage of men who have sex with men (MSM), probability of male-to-male in-

121

fection per sexual contact, and HIV prevalence ratio between MSM and heterosexuals), four

122

resistance-related parameters (resistance rates, reversion to wild-type rate and the eect of

123

NNRTI-resistance on NNRTI ecacy) and one parameter related to treatment (ecacy of DTG-

124

based treatment).

Multivariate uncertainty within specied ranges was assessed using Latin

125

hypercube sampling [22]. Each model estimate is reported with a 95% sensitivity range. Further

126

details are available in S1 Text, Section 3.2.

In addition, we also investigated the impact of

127

lower treatment-initiation rates than suggested by the Treat-All policy (as suggested by [23]),

128

treatment interruption and higher ecacy of DTG on NNRTI PDR (S1 Text, Section 5).

129

Results

130

Use of NNRTIs and levels of resistance

131

The percentages of patients treated with NNRTI and PI for each of the nine scenarios are shown in

132

Fig 2. The predicted evolution of levels of NNRTI resistance up to 2040 across the nine scenarios

133

is shown in Fig 3. The model predicts that while NNRTI resistance would increase substantially

134

under continued NNRTI-based ART, the introduction of DTG-based ART can halt this increase,

135

if in addition to starting new patients on a DTG-based regimen the patients on NNRTI-based

136

regimens are switched to DTG-based rst-line ART. Specically, under the scenario of continued

137

NNRTI-based ART as standard rst-line therapy, NNRTI resistance would increase to 46.8%

138

(95% sensitivity range: 19.7%-54.5%) by 2030 and 58.5% (32.5%-68.9%) by 2040 (Fig 3A). At

139

the other end of the spectrum, initiating all new ART patients on DTG-based ART and rapidly

140

switching all patients currently on NNRTI-based ART to DTG-based regimens, independently

141

of their gender, would stabilize NNRTI resistance at a low level, with a prevalence of 14.3%

142

(3.5%-17.5%) by 2030 and 14.8% (6.6%-19.5%) by 2040 (Fig 3B). Using DTG only in rst-line

143

regimens of patients initiating ART is not sucient to curb the increase of NNRTI resistance,

144

even when given to all men and women (Fig 3A).

145

Restricting DTG-based ART to men to avoid the risk of DTG-associated neural tube defects

146

in newborns will not curb the increase in NNRTI resistance:

the prevalence of resistance is

147

predicted to increase over the entire study period, reaching values of close to 50% by 2040

148

(Fig 3B). The situation is similar under the scenario of initiating or switching men and women

149

beyond childbearing age (17.5% of women in the IeDEA cohorts). However, the model estimates

150

that the increase in the prevalence of NNRTI resistance is substantially slowed down if women

151

beyond the age of reproduction or on contraception (63% of women) also initiate a DTG-based

152

regimen or switch to DTG. Under this scenario the prevalence of NNRTI resistance is predicted

153

to reach 35.1% (17.0%-48.7%) in 2040 (and 23.9% (7.7%-29.3%) by 2030) if DTG is given to

154

both ART-initiators and individuals already on NNRTI-based ART (Fig 3).

155

Impact of switching rates

156

We calculated levels of NNRTI resistance for 2035 for dierent average switching delays and per-

157

centages of women eligible for DTG-based ART. We considered the eect of a modied switching

158

rate both in suppressed individuals (Fig 4A) and in individuals on a failing regimen (Fig 4B).

159

The predicted levels of NNRTI resistance range from 14.5% to 48.8%. The results indicate po-

160

tential benets of both strategies to reduce NNRTI resistance. However, as shown by the greater

161

variation in the prevalence of NNRTI resistance in the vertical than horizontal direction in Fig

Impact of DTG-eligibility on the rate of NNRTI failure

165

As expected from their eect on NNRTI resistance, the dierent scenarios of the rollout of DTG-

166

based ART also inuence the rate of virological failure in women NNRTI-based ART among

167

DTG-ineligible. We nd that the proportion of NNRTI failure is increasing over calendar time

168

of ART start for all scenarios, as a result of the increase of NNRTI resistance among NNRTI-

169

initiators (see Fig 5, 2025 vs 2035). In the absence of DTG introduction, we observe a high level

170

of failure in women starting NNRTI in 2035, reaching 42.4% after 2 years of ART. Providing

171

all men with DTG would help diminish the level of failure by 2 years to 32.3% in 2035. This

172

percentage decreases to 28.7% , when including all women not at risk of pregnancy, and to 25.5%

173

if all men and 99% of women are included. Therefore, we nd that the increase of virological

174

failure in DTG-ineligible women who still rely on NNRTI can be stopped by the introduction of

175

DTG.

Fig 3. Predicted levels of NNRTI pre-treatment drug resistance in South Africa
(PDR) 2005-2040. Dolutegravir is introduced in 2019 under two scenarios: DTG as rstline regimen for ART-initiators (panel A) or DTG for all patients (panel B), and with dierent
eligibility criteria for women. The baseline model shows the situation without the introduction
of dolutegravir (black line).

The two boxes on the right of each panel represent the levels of

NNRTI resistance in 2040 and their 95% sensitivity ranges.

Discussion

177

We adapted the epidemiological MARISA model to examine the impact of the scale-up of DTG-

178

based ART on NNRTI pre-treatment drug resistance in South Africa.

Overall, our ndings

179

suggest that if a large fraction of women is excluded from receiving DTG-based ART, they will

180

not only receive a potentially inferior NNRTI-based regimen but will also face increasing rates of

181

resistance to this regimen due to the population level eects of continued NNRTI use. In contrast,

182

the spread of NNRTI-resistance can be slowed down if DTG-based ART is made accessible both

183

to women at low risk of pregnancy and to people currently on a NNRTI-based rst-line regimen,

184

thereby indirectly protecting those still requiring a NNRTI-based treatment. Model simulations

185

emphasize the importance starting on or switching a maximum number of women to DTG-based

186

ART: increasing use of DTG-based regimens was the strategy with the greatest potential to curb

187

the spread of NNRTI resistance. The latter strategy will also lower the risk of virologic failure

188

in women who have to rely on NNRTI-based ART in the future.

189

While some countries, such as South Africa, rst considered to limit access to DTG to men,

190

menopausal women, and women using long-term family planning as a potential policy, the new

191

WHO guidelines state that women should not in principle be excluded from DTG-based ART,

patients on rst-line ART with suppressed HIV-1 replication, and panel B to individuals failing

even women who are at risk of pregnancy or desire to get pregnant.

WHO recommends a

193

woman-centered approach where women should be provided with information about benets

194

and risks to make an informed choice [24, 16].

195

It is unclear what proportion of women will

eectively receive DTG-based ART, as it depends on individual women's decisions.

In this

196

context, model simulations are essential in order to assess the impact of the dierent options

197

proposed and dierent levels of DTG uptake. A strength of our model is that it deals with the

198

two most signicant sources of uncertainty associated with the introduction of DTG, namely

199

DTG uptake in women and the delay in switching people currently on NNRTI regimens. Despite

200

the uncertainty concerning the uptake of DTG in women, it is likely that a proportion of women

201

will continue to rely on NNRTI-based ART. Therefore, even with the rollout of DTG, NNRTI

202

resistance will continue to be relevant for these women. Compared with other modelling work

203

that assessed risks and benets of DTG introduction (e.g. [15]), our model focused on its indirect,

204

population-level impact on NNRTI resistance. Rather than assigning a level of NNRTI resistance

205

that is xed over time, HIV care and disease stages (as in [15]), our model considered the dynamic

206

development of NNRTI resistance under relevant scenarios.

207

Our model also has several limitations. First, real-world data on the ecacy of DTG, especially

208

in resource-limited settings are scarce. Therefore, we conservatively assumed that DTG has a

209

similar ecacy as NNRTI. The eect of higher DTG ecacy, as suggested by several studies

210

[12, 9], is investigated in supplementary analyses (see S1 Text, Section 5.3). Second, predictions

211

of levels of NNRTI resistance over the next twenty years are naturally uncertain, as reected by

212

the wide sensitivity ranges in Fig 3. However, despite the uncertainty, it is clear that the dierent

213

strategies of rolling out DTG-based ART inuenced the levels of NNRTI resistance. Finally, the

214

MARISA model includes some simplifying assumptions, e.g.

we did not model prevention of

215

mother to child transmission (PMTCT), or treatment interruption. However, relaxing some of

216

these assumptions did not drastically change our conclusion (see S1 Text, Section 5).

217

Another limitation of this study is the fact that the MARISA model does not take into ac-

218

count resistances to neither NRTI nor DTG. In the context of the introduction of DTG-based

219

ART, modelling of NRTI resistance is particularly relevant as individuals starting on DTG as a

functional monotherapy due to resistance to both NRTI backbones - tenofovir and lamivudine -

221

experience higher risk of treatment failure [25]. As they are considerably less frequently trans-

222

mitted [26] and revert back quickly [27, 28], NRTI resistances might primarily be an issue for

223

ART-experienced individuals and more specically, in patients failing NNRTI-based regimens,

224

who often exhibit high levels of NRTI resistance [29]. These patients who are on non-suppressive

225

NNRTI-based regimens are expected to switch to DTG, either after identication of treatment

226

failure, following the new WHO guidelines, or blindly [17].

In the context of modelling the

227

DTG rollout, this consideration has two important implications. First, patients currently failing

228

NNRTI-based regimens are expected to have higher DTG failure rates, mainly due to previously

229

acquired NRTI resistance. Second, due to ongoing viral replication and due to pre-existing NRTI

230

resistance, they are at higher risk of accumulating resistance, which may also lead to the emer-

231

gence of DTG resistance.

So far, data on emergence of DTG resistance is primarily available

232

from patients in whom treatment failure was detected relatively early, which may not be the

233

case in African settings [9].

Therefore, to understand risk inherent in the emergence of DTG

234

resistance, adapting the MARISA model by extending its resistance dimension to both NRTI

235

and DTG resistances will be necessary.

236

Conclusion

237

In conclusion, our study indicates that giving access to DTG-based ART to all women not at risk

238

of pregnancy could limit the increase of NNRTI resistance, but even if all women receive DTG-

highlights the importance of a rapid switch of patients currently on NNRTI-based to DTG-based
