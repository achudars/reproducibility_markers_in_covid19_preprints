ABSTRACT

When interpreting the relative effects from a network meta-analysis (NMA), researchers are usually
aware of the potential limitations that may render the results for some comparisons less useful or
meaningless. In the presence of sufficient and appropriate data, some of these limitations (e.g. risk of
bias, small-study effects, publication bias) can be taken into account in the statistical analysis. Very
often, though, the necessary data for applying these methods are missing and data limitations cannot
be formally integrated into ranking. In addition, there are other important characteristics of the
treatment comparisons that cannot be addressed within a statistical model but only through
qualitative judgements; for example, the relevance of data to the research question, the plausibility of
the assumptions, etc. Here, we propose a new measure for treatment ranking called the Probability of
Selecting a Treatment to Recommend (POST-R). We suggest that the order of treatments should
represent the process of considering treatments for selection in clinical practice and we assign to
each treatment a probability of being selected. This process can be considered as a Markov chain
model that allows the end-users of NMA to select the most appropriate treatments based not only on
the NMA results but also to information external to the NMA. In this way, we obtain rankings that
can inform decision-making more efficiently as they represent not only the relative effects but also
their potential limitations. We illustrate our approach using a NMA comparing treatments for chronic
plaque psoriasis and we provide the Stata commands.

Introduction

Network meta-analysis (NMA) provides the highest possible level of evidence for the development
of clinical guidelines and several health care organisations already incorporate NMA findings in their
guidance. NMA provides estimates with increased precision and allows estimating the relative
effectiveness for interventions that have never been compared head-to-head. Additionally, NMA
provides a hierarchy for a specific outcome of all alternative treatments of a comparative
effectiveness review as long as they form a connected network. Treatment ranking has gained much
attention as well as a lot of criticism over the last years1–4. The main criticisms are: a) methods
widely used in the literature have focused on the probability of each treatment being the best without
taking into account the whole ranking distribution and have produced misleading results5,6, b)
ranking is a very influential output and interpretation in isolation from relative effects may lead to
spurious conclusions7 and c) ranking of treatments most often is not interpreted in light of the
limitations of the evidence base (such as risk of bias or insufficient evidence).
To date, the most appropriate approaches for treatment ranking in NMA are probably the SUCRA
(Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking curves) values8 and the more recent P-scores9. SUCRA
values express the proportion of effectiveness/safety an intervention achieves relative to a treatment
that would be the best with no uncertainty. P-scores express the mean extent of certainty that a
treatment is better than the other competing treatments. The two measures are equivalent and differ
only in that SUCRAs are obtained using resampling methods while P-scores are derived
analytically9. Their main advantage is that they account for the variability in treatment ranks by
considering not only the magnitude of relative effects but also their uncertainty and overlap of their
confidence/credible intervals.
However, SUCRAs and P-scores are limited by the fact that they are based solely on the NMA
relative effects and other factors that are often of interest to policy makers in treatment guidelines
can only be incorporated in a qualitative way. For instance, if there are reasons to have less
confidence in some relative effects than in others, then the usefulness of a conventional treatment
ranking becomes questionable. In addition, treatments poorly connected to the rest of the network
tend to appear at the top ranks although the evidence favouring such treatments is often insufficient
or even biased10. Also, safety is a crucial aspect of treatment performance, though very often
disregarded in the evidence synthesis setting due to absence of appropriate and adequate data. Last,
the cost of the treatments is another important factor when forming clinical guidelines and should be
taken into account at the country level.

To address some of these points, Salanti et al.11 developed a framework for evaluating the confidence
in the treatment ranking from NMA, while Chaimani et al.12 suggested a graphical tool depicting the
ranking of treatments based on two characteristics. The drawback of the former approach is that a
low-confidence ranking would fail to answer its target question (i.e. which are the most appropriate
treatments) and efficiently inform medical decision-making. The limitation of the latter approach is
that it does not provide a quantitative way to rank the available treatments considering jointly the two
characteristics of interest.
In this paper, we suggest the Probability Of Selecting a Treatment to Recommend (POST-R) as a
new measure to rank treatments after conducting the systematic review and the NMA. Our approach
is based on a Markov Chain (MC) model and allows taking into account both the relative effects and
the other aforementioned characteristics that may affect treatment choice in practice. MC models
have already been employed in several fields for the development of hierarchies and optimization
strategies, such as in social networks13 and operations research14. Here we use a MC approach in
which the conditional probability distribution of future states of the treatment selection process
depends only on the current state (Markov property); the stationary distribution of this Markov
process is regarded as the probabilities of recommending each treatment. The method is Bayesian in
the sense that our initial choice of treatment recommendation is informed by the relative effects to
result in posterior probabilities of treatment recommendation. The suggested algorithm allows
incorporating information other than that of the relative effects through the initial probabilities
assigned to each treatment. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe
an exemplar NMA used to illustrate our ranking approach. Section 3, after a brief description of Pscores, introduces our ranking method and describes how some key characteristics on top of relative
effects can be incorporated in treatment selection. Finally, in Section 4 we use the example dataset to
illustrate the method and in Section 5 we discuss the strengths and limitations of our approach.

Illustrative example

To illustrate the use of our method and compare the results with the conventional ranking results
according to SUCRA (or P-score) we use a previously published NMA. Our example is a Cochrane
review15 comparing the efficacy and safety of 19 different drugs and placebo for patients with
moderate to severe psoriasis. The primary outcomes were the events of achieving clear or almost
clear skin (i.e. PASI 90) for efficacy and serious adverse events (SAE) for safety.
The authors report in their results for efficacy “…ixekizumab was the best treatment at drug level
(versus placebo: RR 32.45, 95% CI 23.61 to 44.60; SUCRA=94.3; high-certainty evidence),

followed by secukinumab (versus placebo: RR 26.55, 95% CI 20.32 to 34.69; SUCRA=86.5; highcertainty of evidence), brodalumab (versus placebo: RR 25.45, 95% CI 18.74 to 34.57; SUCRA =
84.3; moderate-certainty evidence), guselkumab (versus placebo: RR 21.03, 95% CI 14.56 to 30.38;
SUCRA = 77; moderate-certainty evidence)…”; and for safety “…methotrexate was associated with
the best safety proﬁle at drug level in terms of serious adverse events (versus placebo: RR 0.23, 95%
CI 0.05 to 0.99; SUCRA = 90.7; moderate-certainty evidence), followed by ciclosporin (versus
placebo: RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.10; SUCRA = 78.2; very low-certainty evidence) […]
Nevertheless, analyses on serious adverse events were based on a very low number of events and
were reduced to the short time frame of the trials”15. These findings imply that a) the confidence (or
certainty) of the evidence is not consistent across drugs and b) the authors are somewhat concerned
about the safety results due to rare events and short follow-up of the trials. However, the ranking
based on SUCRA provided in the published paper does not account for these factors.
In addition, considering the SUCRAs for both efficacy and safety the original review suggests that
Certolizumab, a treatment connected rather weakly to the rest of the network, achieves the better
compromise between the two outcomes (Figure 1). Due to the scarcity of the evidence for that
treatment, though, several clinicians might be sceptic about this finding. In our application we show
how treatments are ranked using the POST-R measure and compare results from each approach.

Methods
Conventional ranking in NMA

Several different approaches have been used in the literature to rank competing interventions in a
network of trials6. Here we describe briefly how P-score9 (the analytical equivalent of SUCRA8),
which is based on both the mean and the variance of the NMA relative effects, is computed.
Consider a network with 𝑁 treatments (nodes). P-score is based on the probabilities 𝑝𝑖>𝑗 that
treatment 𝑖 produces a better outcome that treatment 𝑗 with 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑁 and 𝑝𝑖>𝑗 = 0 for 𝑖 = 𝑗.
Ruecker and Schwarzer9 showed that these probabilities can be obtained as
𝑝𝑖>𝑗 = 𝛷 (

̂ 𝑖 −𝜇
̂𝑗
𝜇
̂ 𝑖𝑗
𝜎

)

(1)

where 𝛷 is the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution, 𝜇̂ 𝑖 − 𝜇̂ 𝑗 is the
estimated difference in the studied outcome between the two treatments and 𝜎̂𝑖𝑗 is the estimated

Treatment ranking as a discrete stochastic process

We assume a Markov process (𝑆) with a countable state space where every treatment (node) 𝑖 =
1, … , 𝑁 within the network under investigation is a state 𝑠𝑖 . 𝑆 starts at time 𝑡 = 1 by moving between
the 𝑁 treatment options with an aim to identify those with the best performance for the main
outcome of interest (e.g. efficacy). Each time-point 𝑡 = 1,2,3, … corresponds to a new step in 𝑆. A
movement from 𝑖 to 𝑗 in this setting implies that we were not satisfied with 𝑖 and we select 𝑗 as a
potentially more beneficial treatment. Since movements represent the preference between two
treatments, they are not uniformly distributed but they are based on prior beliefs and actual data. So,
(𝑡)

(𝑡) ′

(𝑡)

let 𝑙𝑖 be the probability of selecting treatment 𝑖 at time (i.e. step) 𝑡 and 𝐐(𝐭) = (𝑙1 , … , 𝑙𝑁 ) . The
(0)

(0)

vector 𝐐(𝟎) is called the initial state probability vector with entries the probabilities 𝑙1 , … , 𝑙𝑁 of
selecting each treatment 𝑖 at time 𝑡 = 0; hence without looking at the NMA relative effects for the
outcome of interest. Different ways for defining 𝐐(𝟎) are suggested in Section 3.3.
(1)

A key aspect of the model is the definition of the transition probabilities 𝑝𝑖→𝑗 at the beginning of 𝑆;
that corresponds to the probability of selecting treatment 𝑗 at 𝑡 = 2 after having selected treatment 𝑖
when 𝑡 = 1. These probabilities form the component of the MC model that incorporates the NMA
(1)

relative effects for updating the initial probabilities. We suggest that 𝑝𝑖→𝑗 ’s can be driven by the
probabilities 𝑝𝑖>𝑗 in Equation (1) implying that at 𝑡 = 1 movements between treatments are solely
based on the probabilities that each treatment 𝑖 produces a better outcome than 𝑗. Given that the
(𝑡)

transition probabilities at every 𝑡 should satisfy ∑𝑁
𝑗=1 𝑝𝑖→𝑗 = 1, we define

𝑝𝑗>𝑖

𝑝𝑖→𝑗 = ∑𝑁

It follows from Equations (1) and (2) that 𝑝𝑖→𝑖 = 0 while for any pair (𝑖, 𝑗) 𝑝𝑖→𝑗 > 0. As a result, the

For

simplicity, in the rest of the manuscript we suppress the superscript (1) when 𝑡 = 1. Equation (2)

(𝑡)

states 𝑝𝑖→𝑖 = 0 for 𝑡 = 1,2,3, …) MC16. When the MC is ergodic it has a unique stationary
distribution 𝜋 to which it converges for large values of 𝑡, namely lim 𝐐(𝐭) = 𝝅. It has been shown
𝑡→∞

that
𝝅 = 𝐀𝝅

and thus 𝝅 is an eigenvector of 𝐀 with eigenvalue 117. For a treatment network this stationary

) and offers an intuitive way to rank the treatments of a NMA.

According to Equation (3) treatment ranking could be easily obtained as an eigenvector (with
eigenvalue 1) of matrix 𝐀; however, it is informed only by the relative effects (via the transition
probabilities in 𝐀) and therefore it shares the same limitation with the conventional ranking
approaches discussed earlier.
3.2.2

Incorporating the initial probability distribution in ranking

To build our model, we employ a special case of a MC previously used for the development of the
PageRank algorithm that ranks websites by Google search results13. The difference between
Google’s model and other MC models is that the former considers that there is always a probability
of starting again the stochastic process according to the initial probability distribution. So, let 𝑧 ∈
(0,1) be the probability that the treatment selection process continues with updating at each step the
probability distribution according to 𝐀 and (1 − 𝑧) the probability that the process starts again from
𝐐(𝟎) . It should be noted that such a scenario reflects situations where the NMA fails to adequately
update the existing evidence (e.g. due to few data) and conclusions are based to some extent on
previous knowledge or other characteristics (such as data quality). More discussion on the definition
of 𝑧 is presented in Section 3.4.
This MC configuration leads to the modified transition probabilities

Defining the 𝐐(𝟎) vector

The initial state probability vector in 𝐐(𝟎) is the key feature that differentiates our method with the
existing ranking approaches (see Section 3.1), and allows incorporating information other than NMA
relative effects for treatment recommendation. It is, though, challenging to find a reasonable way to

define the initial probabilities 𝑙𝑖 . Investigators should bear in mind that each 𝑙𝑖

represents the

probability of selecting every treatment 𝑖 in clinical practice without knowing the NMA relative
effects for the outcome of interest and consequently neither the probabilities 𝑝𝑖>𝑗 . In such a case,
treatment choice depends on other characteristic(s) expressed via 𝐐(𝟎) . Here we consider the
following characteristics, which we believe are among the most important for forming treatment
guidelines:


Confidence in the evidence: evidence on some of the treatments might be less ‘trustworthy’ than
for others. It should be noted that confidence in the evidence from NMA is based on the network
structure, precision, the validity of the assumptions, assessment of risk of bias etc., so it is
dependent on the NMA setting but independent of the actual values of the relative effects.



Clinical experience: prior information from clinical practice is important and is not always in
agreement with study results as the latter may lack power, have a short follow-up period etc.



Cost of the treatments: the relative outcomes and costs of available interventions should be
assessed, cheaper treatments might be preferable if they yield similar outcomes to slightly more
effective, but expensive, ones.



Treatment safety: efficacy and safety should always be considered jointly when forming
recommendations.
(0)

It is evident that the definition of the probabilities 𝑙𝑖

is subjective to some extent and depends on

the medical field and research question. In the following sections we suggest ways for defining 𝐐(𝟎)
using the four characteristics mentioned above.
3.3.1

Confidence in the evidence as a criterion for 𝐐(𝟎)

All recent reporting guidelines for NMA recommend including in the manuscript a table with the
confidence (called also quality or certainty in the literature) for every treatment comparison in the
network7,19. To date, two approaches are available for preparing such a table11,20. Here we consider
the approach by Salanti et al.11 and the recent updates implemented in the online tool CINeMA
(available from http://cinema.ispm.ch/)21,22. Note that such an evaluation typically is conducted after
completing the systematic review and the NMA and not at the beginning of the process. However, it
still can be used to form ‘prior’ information on treatment ranks.
We focus on the final report of the full evaluation where there are four possible levels of confidence
assigned at each comparison: high, moderate, low, and very low. We translate these levels into
probabilities that the evidence is trustworthy. Reasonable values might be 𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡) = 0.9, 0.7, 0.3
and 0.1 respectively. Then, we can obtain the following confidence matrix

where 𝑐𝑖−𝑗 is the probability of ‘trusting’ the use of treatment 𝑖 more than treatment 𝑗. We define 𝑐𝑖−𝑗
as follows:


If the mean relative effect between 𝑖 and 𝑗 favours 𝑖, then 𝑐𝑖−𝑗 = 𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡)𝑖−𝑗 and 𝑐𝑗−𝑖 = 0



If the mean relative effect between 𝑖 and 𝑗 favours 𝑗, then 𝑐𝑗−𝑖 = 𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡)𝑖−𝑗 (note that
𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡)𝑖−𝑗 = 𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡)𝑗−𝑖 ) and 𝑐𝑖−𝑗 = 0



If the mean relative effect between 𝑖 and 𝑗 does not favour any treatment, then 𝑐𝑖−𝑗 =
𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡)𝑖−𝑗 /2 and 𝑐𝑗−𝑖 = 𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡)𝑖−𝑗 /2.

It is important to note that what relative effect would lead to favour one treatment over the other
depends on the clinical setting. For example, the investigators might define a priori the value of a
clinically important effect to be used (such as an estimated risk ratio of 1.1, 1.2, etc.). Using the
columns of 𝐂 we can obtain an estimate of the average confidence for using each treatment 𝑖 as
𝑁

1
𝐶𝑖̅ =
∑ 𝑐𝑖−𝑗
𝑁−1
𝑗=1

which is the analogous to the P-score (𝑃̅𝑖 ). Since 𝐐(𝟎) is a probability vector, its elements should add
up to 1. Therefore, we define

𝑙𝑖

̅
= 𝐶𝑖̅ / ∑𝑁
𝑖=1 𝐶𝑖

(6)

This is the probability to select treatment 𝑖 among all treatments in the network given the matrix 𝐂.
3.3.2

Clinical experience as a criterion for 𝐐(𝟎)

Several methods have been suggested in the literature for expert opinion elicitation on probability
distributions23. Possibly one of the simplest approaches that can be easily understood by clinicians is
the so-called roulette method which has been implemented also in the MATCH tool
(http://optics.eee.nottingham.ac.uk/match/uncertainty.php)24. Briefly, we adapted the method to our
setting as follows: We provide to experts a grid with 𝑁 equally sized bins each corresponding to a
treatment in the network. Subsequently, we ask from the experts to allocate 100 chips (representing
100 patients) to the 𝑁 bins based on their experience about the performance of the treatments in
terms of a particular characteristic; for instance, by considering their safety alone. Then, the initial

(0)

probability 𝑙𝑖

of selecting each treatment 𝑖 is the proportion of chips allocated to the respective bin.

Inevitably, expert opinions are subjective to some degree but asking several experts may mitigate
this subjectivity. A simple (although not perfect) way, for instance, to combine opinions from 2 or
(0)

more experts is to use as 𝑙𝑖

the weighted average of the expert-specific probabilities with weights

the years of experience.
3.3.3

Costs a criterion for 𝐐(𝟎)

Consider that 𝑇 is the most expensive treatment in the market among the 𝑁 options. We define
0,
𝑑𝑖 = {

1−

𝑖𝑓 𝑖 = 𝑇
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑖
,
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑇

𝑖𝑓 𝑖 ≠ 𝑇

This means that the probability of selecting treatment 𝑖 based on its cost is related to the percentage
(0)

of the cost of 𝑇 that 𝑖 has. Then, the probabilities 𝑙𝑖

are obtained by Equation (6), replacing 𝐶𝑖̅ by

𝑑𝑖 .
3.3.4

Safety a criterion for 𝐐(𝟎)

Although we focus on treatment safety here, the approach applies equally to any other outcome. The
combination of two outcomes in the treatment selection process can be made through a two-stage
approach:


At the first stage we rank the treatments for the ‘less’ important outcome between the two (for
example safety if efficacy is considered more important) using the POST-R approach.



Then, at the second stage the stationary probability distribution 𝑟 obtained for this outcome
becomes the initial probability vector 𝐐(𝟎) in Equation (5) to be combined with A for the overall
treatment selection probabilities.

3.4

Defining the probability 𝑧

Considering that a NMA is (or should be) conducted when there is a need for updating and extending
the existing evidence, we believe that 𝑧 should generally take values larger than 0.5. We suggest that
values between 0.6 and 0.9 might be reasonable. It is not straightforward, though, how to select the
optimal 𝑧 value as this might depend also on the clinical setting and the available data. Running a
sensitivity analysis on a range of values for 𝑧 could show how robust ranking results are under
different scenarios. The value of 𝑧 can also be informed by expert opinion. For example, we can ask

this is a necessary condition for reassuring that an eigenvector of matrix B with eigenvalue 1 exists25.

treatments for the two primary outcomes (PASI 90 and SAE). These were obtained using the
network26 and network graph27 packages in Stata. The dataset and the Stata script used to obtain the
results can be found in the Supplementary files. The league table of the relative effects and the
respective league table with the probabilities 𝑝𝑖>𝑗 are available in the Appendix (Appendix Table 1
Appendix Table 2 respectively).

4.2

Treatment ranking combining efficacy and confidence in the evidence

Using the CINeMA application, we obtained the domain-specific judgements for each comparison in
the network and then we summarized them into an overall confidence for every comparison
(Appendix Table 3). The last column of the table presents the probability 𝑃(𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡) for each
comparison. We considered overall in CINeMA a risk ratio of 2 as a clinically important relative
effect between two treatments to justify selection of one treatment over the other. This clinically
important effect was used for the evaluation of imprecision, heterogeneity and incoherence (more
details available in CINeMA’s documentation page http://cinema.ispm.ch/#doc) as well as for the
definition of probabilities 𝑐𝑖−𝑗 (see Section 3.3.1). The matrix C is available in the Appendix
(0)

(Appendix Table 3), while the probabilities 𝑙𝑖

(Table 1) were obtained using Equation (6).

Interestingly, ixekizumab that appears to be the most efficacious treatment for PASI 90 is also at the
top of the ranking with respect to the confidence of the evidence followed by guselkumab (Table 1).
We considered that 𝑧 = 0.75 is a good compromise between the two sources of information (i.e.
relative effects for efficacy and confidence of the evidence for efficacy). It seems that the
incorporation of the confidence in the evidence resulted in small changes in the overall picture of
treatment ranking for efficacy (Figure 3). That was expected given that treatments that appeared to
perform better with respect to efficacy were also at the top ranks in terms of the confidence in the
evidence (Table 1).

4.3

Treatment ranking combining efficacy and clinical experience for efficacy

We elicited the clinical experience data on efficacy in terms of treatment selection probabilities using
the MATCH tool as Appendix Figure 1(a) shows. Each chip represented 5 hypothetical patients from
the population of the original Cochrane review. For illustration purposes in the present study, one
dermatologist was asked to allocate 100 patients to the 20 possible treatment options (including
placebo) considering how participants are on average allocated to the different drugs in clinical
practice. In the presence of prescription data (e.g. from national registries), these could also be used
to form some kind of clinical experience data. We used again 𝑧 = 0.75 considering clinical
experience for this outcome needs only be a supplementary source of information. Figure 3 implies
that the incorporation of clinical experience materially affects the ranks of the treatment. In
particular, ustekinumab is favoured and appears at the second position now with more than 12%
probability of being selected among all treatments.
4.4

Treatment ranking combining efficacy and safety informed by clinical experience

Here we obtained the final 𝑟 vector in two steps:


First, we combined the clinical experience probabilities for safety with the relative effects for
safety to obtain the safety ranking. Considering the concerns expressed previously about the SAE
data (see Section 2), we used 𝑧 = 0.7 that reduced slightly more the influence of the relative
effects in treatment ranking for safety. The resulted probability vector of this step (𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒𝑡𝑦 ),
which is shown in Table 1, was then used at the second step as the initial probability distribution
𝐐(𝟎) .



At the second step, we combined the 𝐐(𝟎) as defined above with the relative effects for efficacy
to rank treatments based on both outcomes using 𝑧 = 0.65.

Again, ustekinumab seems to be the most favoured treatment in comparison with the conventional
ranking results based on SUCRAs. However, ixekizumab and certolizumab remained at the top of
the hierarchy.
4.5

Treatment ranking combining efficacy and cost

In the psoriasis example, the 19 different systemic treatments are very diverse in terms of their cost;
therefore we considered treatment cost as an important characteristic to be incorporated in treatment
ranking. Specifically, the cost of each treatment per person per year in France was used to form the
𝐐(𝟎) vector following the approach in Section 3.3.3. Note that treatment cost might be different
across countries and therefore our findings might not be directly applicable outside France. Appendix

Table 5 shows the average cost of each drug. Secukinumab, ixekizumab and brodalumab are the
most expensive treatments, while some of the drugs have not yet been commercialised; for such
drugs we considered that they have zero probability of being selected considering their cost only. We
used a probability 𝑧 = 0.8 implying that treatment cost should not be considered as a key component
of treatment ranking but only for selection between drugs with overall similar performance on other
important factors (such as the outcomes of interest). Figure 3 shows that, after incorporating in
ranking the cost information, the highly efficacious drugs remained at the top positions.
Overall, according to Figure 3 a group of eight drugs achieved more 5% probability of being selected
under all four considerations and one drug more than 10% (ixekizumab). Ustekinumab seems to the
drug with most unclear performance as it was favoured when clinical experience was considered but
not so much by the actual data. This possibly means that the benefits of this drug need further
investigation.

Discussion

Treatment ranking is a key and potentially very informative output of NMA but inappropriate use
and misinterpretation of ranking, which are regularly encountered in published NMAs, have made
several researchers being sceptical about its usefulness1,5,6. A key point prior to drawing conclusions
from ranking results is understanding what the estimated order of the treatments may represent.
Currently available approaches provide rankings based either only on the mean of the relative effects
(e.g. ranked forest plots) or on the mean and a part of the distribution of the relative effects (e.g. the
probability of being best/worst) or at best on the mean and the full distribution of the relative effects
(i.e. SUCRAs/P-scores). As a result, these methods produce rankings that are as reliable as the
estimated means and/or variances of the relative effects.
In the present paper, we move forward from ranking measures that just provide a summary of the
relative effects and introduce a new concept of treatment ranking. A drawback of our approach is
that the definition of the vector 𝐐(𝟎) and the probability 𝑧 is subjective to some degree. It is
important that one describes in detail in the protocol of the analysis how (s)he will define these
quantities. We can also mitigate this subjectivity by incorporating views from many clinicians with
experience in the condition under investigation. In addition, the method can be also applied in
Bayesian framework were 𝐐(𝟎) and 𝑧 can be modelled through distributions allowing for uncertainty
in their values. It should be noted that both 𝐐(𝟎) and 𝑧 are dependent on the characteristics being
considered, the medical field and the research question and therefore the criteria for their definition

are specific to every NMA. Although such an approach seems to require additional time and
resources than current practices in NMA, recent directions in evidence synthesis that encourage
living systematic reviews and live cumulative network meta-analyses within the context of a research
community are well compatible to our method28–32.
An important limitation of our application is that probabilities based on clinical experience were
elicited after the publication of the original NMA. Hence, the clinician who provided expertise could
have been influenced by the published NMA results. It should be noted that we used a possibly
extreme value of the minimally clinical important difference in CINeMA (i.e. risk ratio of 2) which
might not apply in clinical practice. Moreover, in the present article we surveyed only one clinician
for simplicity; articles aiming to address clinical questions should opt for several experts to inform
their POST-R model. In addition, there might be other important characteristics affecting treatment
selection that were not considered here. It is important to note that our results are only illustrative of
the methods and do aim to draw clinical inferences; the latter would require careful consideration of
the definition for 𝐐(𝟎) and 𝑧 at the beginning of the study. To avoid data-driven decisions and
selective reporting of results when using our ranking approach, it is important that a clear and
transparent description of the criteria to be used for the definition of 𝐐(𝟎) and 𝑧 are available in the
protocol.
Our approach offers a more intuitive way of thinking treatment ranking as it accommodates the
different considerations being made before selecting a treatment in practice. The POST-R approach
has been implemented in the ‘sucra’ command of the network graphs package27 in Stata33 which
facilitates its use once 𝐐(𝟎) has been specified. Additional work is necessary to extend the method
into a generalised ranking framework that will allow multiple characteristics to be combined
simultaneously with the relative effects. A key issue, very often disregarded in the literature, when
obtaining the ranking of treatments is to acknowledge that it is always accompanied with a level of
uncertainty2,4,11. The POST-R approach naturally captures the uncertainty in treatment selection by
allowing the end-user of NMA to ‘move’ between the different treatment options (or between groups
of treatments) with some probability.
Generally, despite the various and well-founded criticisms, estimation of ranking remains one of the
main objectives for several NMAs implying that clinicians and decision-makers are interested in it.
Thus, it is necessary to produce NMA summaries that, instead of just acknowledging any data
limitations and/or availability of external evidence, they formally integrate these considerations with
the results in the league table to make valid recommendations. Such an effort might be less important

in dense and coherent networks with many high-quality studies for every treatment comparison. Our
method may target primarily NMAs stating “more well-conducted studies are necessary” with an
aim to assist such reviews drawing more useful conclusions until new studies come up.
