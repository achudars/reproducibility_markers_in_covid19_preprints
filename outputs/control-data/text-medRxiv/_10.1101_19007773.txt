Structured abstract
Objective. To determine whether naturally occurring autoantibodies against the prion protein
are present in individuals with genetic prion disease mutations and controls, and if so,
whether they are protective against prion disease.
Methods. In this case-control study, we collected 124 blood samples from individuals with a
variety of pathogenic PRNP mutations and 78 control individuals with a positive family
history of genetic prion disease but lacking disease-associated PRNP mutations. Antibody
reactivity was measured using an indirect ELISA for the detection of human IgG1-4 antibodies
against wild-type human prion protein. Multivariate linear regression models were
constructed to analyze differences in autoantibody reactivity between a) PRNP mutation
carriers versus controls and b) asymptomatic versus symptomatic PRNP mutation carriers.
Robustness of results was examined in matched cohorts.
Results. We found that antibody reactivity was present in a subset of both PRNP mutation
carriers and controls. Autoantibody levels were not influenced by PRNP mutation status nor
clinical manifestation of prion disease. Post hoc analyses showed anti-PrPC autoantibody
titers to be independent of personal history of autoimmune disease and other immunological
disorders, as well as PRNP codon 129 polymorphism.
Conclusions. Pathogenic PRNP variants do not notably stimulate antibody-mediated antiPrPC immunity. Anti-PrPC IgG autoantibodies are not associated with the onset of prion
disease. The presence of anti-PrPC autoantibodies in the general population without any
disease-specific association suggests that relatively high titers of naturally occurring
antibodies are well tolerated. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02837705.

Introduction
Prion diseases are diseases of the central nervous system which not only occur as sporadic
and transmissible forms, but can also be transmitted through the germ line as autosomal
dominant traits 1. Genetic prion diseases (gPrDs) account for ~ 10-15 % of all prion diseases
and are characterized by pathogenic, non-synonymous mutations of the human prion protein
gene PRNP 2. The most prevalent human prion disease, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(sCJD), is characterized by a rapidly progressive dementia and a short survival time (usually
< 1 year) from clinical onset 3. In contrast, PRNP mutation carriers often present with atypical
phenotypes, e.g. long survival rates can be observed in Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker
disease (GSS) 4.
The cellular prion protein PrPC consists of an unstructured, flexible tail (FT) on its N-terminal
end and a C-terminal globular domain (GD) 5. We have shown in 2001 that humoral
immunity against PrPC can protect against prion neuroinvasion 6. Antibodies against the FT
of PrPC, or removal of amino acid residues from the FT, abrogate the neurotoxic effects of
anti-PrPC-GD antibodies and reduce the toxicity of bona fide prions

7, 8

. Naturally occurring

PrP antibodies may exist in the general population: for instance, reactivity against a 21residue PrP peptide was observed in commercial pooled immunoglobulin 9, and a unique
blood group has been observed in individuals homozygous for the E219K polymorphism
Clinical trials have yet to deliver an effective anti-prion agent so far

10

.

11-14

. An ongoing clinical

study involves the administration of PRN100, a humanized antibody against PrPC-GD, to
individuals suffering from CJD 15. While there is much hope that this trial will be successful,
the murine counter-part of PRN100, ICSM18, exhibits an on-target, dose-dependent toxicity,
and whether a therapeutic window exists has not yet been established 16-18.
The frequency of PRNP missense variants exceeds the reported genetic prion disease
prevalence, suggesting a spectrum of disease penetrance in gPrDs rather than complete
penetrance of non-synonymous PRNP mutations

19

. The mechanisms by which these

mutations induce disease are still largely unclear. The majority of structural studies on
human PrPC variants linked to genetic prion disease failed to identify consistent effects on
global protein stability 20. Age of onset in gPrD is highly variable, and typically middle age or
older, which might suggest that a protective mechanism guards some individuals against the
prion protein-induced toxicity 2. We hypothesized that subtle conformational alterations of
pathogenic PrPC variants could stochastically generate immunogenic neo-epitopes, which in
turn might elicit a protective humoral anti-PrPC immune response. We therefore conducted
an extensive search for such autoantibodies in individuals carrying pathogenic PRNP
mutations, and in unaffected relatives as controls.

Material and Methods
Ethics statement. The Cantonal Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich approved this
study (permit no. “KEK-ZH Nr.2015-0514”). This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (no.
NCT02837705). The protocol for this study was approved by the institutional review board at
each participating institution with the University of Zurich being the lead regulatory site.
Written informed patient consent was received by all individuals participating in this study.
Human subjects and study design. We defined PRNP mutation carriers as individuals with
a non-synonymous mutation in the open reading frame of the PRNP gene that was
previously reported to be pathogenic 2. Between September 2015 and October 2018, we
contacted both international patient organizations as well as national prion disease reference
centers for further re-use of existing blood samples. Individuals at any age with a confirmed
PRNP mutation were considered eligible for this study. Individuals with a confirmed PRNP
mutation in a blood relative who did not undergo PRNP sequencing prior to enrollment in this
study were also considered eligible if they gave consent for PRNP sequencing. Blood
samples without information on age or gender were excluded from further analysis. PRNP
wild-type individuals with neurological or psychiatric symptoms indicative of genetic prion
disease were excluded from the study

21

. Clinical manifestation of gPrD was defined as

presence of both a pathogenic PRNP mutation and PrD-typical symptoms 21. The latter were
assessed by clinical exam and neuropsychological assessment, in some cases
complemented by ancillary tests such as presence of 14-3-3 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid,
real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays, electroencephalography and
magnetic resonance imaging

22

. Personal history of autoimmune disease and other

immunological disorders could be obtained in n = 141 of participants. A detailed description
of the patient cohort is given in table 1. For sensitivity analysis, cases and controls were
matched on age (± 5 years), gender and blood sample type (i.e. serum or plasma).
PRNP genotyping. PRNP genotyping was performed using a modified version of the
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). 20 μL of PK (600 mAU/ml) and 200 μL of 5 M

guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) with 1% Triton-X100 at pH = 5.0 were added to 200 μL of
anticoagulated blood, vortexed thoroughly and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. 200

μL EtOH (96-100%) were added to the reaction and the rest of the DNA purification was
performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The primer pair PRNP_up and
PRNP_low (table e-1 available from Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.08kprr4xk) was
used in combination with Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) to amplify
the open reading frame from exon 2 of PRNP. Sanger sequencing was performed at the
Department of Molecular Pathology (Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital
Zurich) using four different sequencing primers (PRNP_up, PRNP_up2, PRNP_low,
PRNP_low2, table e-1 available from Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.08kprr4xk).
Sequencing traces were aligned to reference DNA from the Reference Sequence (RefSeq)
Database (O'Leary et al. 2016) using CLC Main Workbench (Qiagen) and packages
sangerseqr23 and DECIPHER24 for Bioconductor25 in R.
Statistical analyses. We performed a priori testing of anti-PrPC autoantibody reactivity for
the following hypotheses: a) differences in anti-PrPC autoantibody reactivity between PRNP
mutation carriers and PRNP wild-type individuals and b) differences in anti-PrPC
autoantibody reactivity between PRNP mutation carriers showing clinical signs of prion
diseases and those without. All other analyses were performed post hoc. We used already
established predictors of autoimmune disease such as age

26

and gender

27

as well as

storage conditions known to affect antibody responses such as presence of coagulation
factors

28

as covariates in our multivariate regression model. Using the purposeful selection

of covariates method as described previously

29

, effects of covariates on autoantibody titers

were tested by bivariate linear regression analyses using the Wald test and included for
multivariate testing at a p-value cut-off point of 0.25. In the multivariate model covariates
were removed if they were non-significant at the 0.1 alpha level or not a confounder, as
determined by a change in the remaining parameter estimate greater than 20 % as
compared to the full model. PRNP mutation status, clinical signs of prion disease, PRNP

codon 129 polymorphism were added after establishment of significant confounders. In
matched cohorts, multivariate models were adjusted for matching factors.
All values are given as average ± standard deviation unless mentioned otherwise. For
analysis, autoantibody titers were log10-transformed, and reported β coefficients and
confidence intervals represent back-transformed values. Normality was tested using the
D’Agostino-Pearson normality test. For values following a Gaussian distribution, differences
between two groups were compared using two-tailed student’s T test. For not normally
distributed values, Mann Whitney U Test was used for comparison of two groups. For
comparison of categorical variables, Fisher’s exact test and chi-squared test were used for
comparison of two and more than two groups, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficient
was computed for data sampled from Gaussian distributions and Spearman's rho for those
sampled from non-Gaussian distributions. Matching of cases and controls was done using
the find.matches function from the Hmisc package in R. We used lm for R for linear
regression analysis. Python and R were used for statistical analysis, data visualization was
performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad).
Data availability statement. The study participants, if they have not undergone predictive
testing themselves, participated under the condition of not knowing their PRNP genotype.
Due to the relatively small sample size and risk of de-identification, all raw study data
involving human participants was made available to the editors and reviewers but will not be
made available publicly. Supplementary data, as well as DNA sequences of gene blocks
used for construction of humanized antibodies and human PrPC-AviTagTM are available at
Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.08kprr4xk.

Results
Description of the cohort. We received blood samples and clinical information from a total
of n = 241 individuals and selected n = 202 unmatched cases and controls for this analysis
(figure 1). To test the robustness of our results, we matched n = 64 cases on n = 64 controls
based on age (± 5 years), gender and blood storage conditions (i.e. serum / plasma, table e2 available from Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.08kprr4xk). Anti-PrPC autoantibody
reactivity was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a
description of the assay is provided in extended text and figures e-1 and e-2 available from
Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.08kprr4xk. Briefly, blood samples were diluted over a
range of > 2 logs and bound autoantibodies were detected with anti-human IgG antibodies.
Antibody titers are expressed as negative common logarithm of the half-maximal effective
concentration (figure e-1E available from Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.08kprr4xk).
Anti-PrPC antibody reactivity was independent of serum IgG levels (Spearman’s ρ = 0.07, p
= 0.69, figure 2A). The age of probands did not influence the IgG levels (Pearson r = 0.33, p
= 0.16). To confirm our ability to detect human antibodies against specific targets, we tested
a subset of individuals for the presence of IgG against the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen
(EBNA). 4/5 PRNPWT and 16/16 PRNPMut individuals tested positive (corresponding to 95 %
positive individuals), in line with anti-EBNA IgG seroprevalence in the general population
(figure 2B) 30.
Prevalence of anti-PrPC autoantibodies in PRNP mutation carriers. The presence of
coagulation factors (e.g. plasma instead of serum), and possibly age, but not female gender
were associated with anti-PrPC autoantibody reactivity in bivariate and multivariate analyses
(table 2)

29

.

We henceforth adjusted all analyses for age and presence of coagulation

factors. Presence or absence of a pathogenic PRNP mutation was not associated with
significant changes in anti-PrPC autoantibody reactivity (table 3). Additionally, we matched
both n = 62 cases and controls on age (± 5 years), gender and blood sample type

26-28

(table

e-2 available from Dryad https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.08kprr4xk). As with the unmatched

cohort, PRNP mutation did not significantly influence anti-PrPC autoantibody titers in
multivariate linear regression adjusted for matching factors (table e-2).
We then tested whether anti-PrPC autoantibody response was associated with symptoms of
prion disease. Presence or absence of clinical signs was reported by n = 122 PRNP
mutation carriers (out of a total of n = 124 enrolled): n = 76 (62.3 %) were asymptomatic
carriers whereas n = 46 (37.7%) presented with clinically apparent disease. Detailed clinical
data was available in n = 14 cases, the most common clinical presentations entailed
cerebellar signs (n = 12, 85.7%) and dementia (n = 11, 78.6%). Status of 14-3-3 protein in
cerebrospinal fluid, albeit a poor predictor of genetic prion disease

31

, was provided by n =

121 of study participants. N = 17 individuals (all PRNP mutation carriers with clinically
apparent disease) were tested with n = 8 (47.1%) being tested positive, in line with previous
findings

31

. Presence of prion-specific symptoms was not associated with alterations in anti-

PrPC autoantibodies in an unmatched cohort (table 3). This was confirmed in an analysis of
a cohort consisting of n = 24 symptomatic PRNP mutation carriers and n = 24 asymptomatic
PRNP mutation carriers matched on PRNP mutation, age and sample type (table e-2).
Post hoc subgroup analyses on the association of anti-PrPC autoantibodies with
specific PrPC mutations, PrPC p.129 polymorphism and autoimmune disease and other
immunological disorders. We analyzed the effects of PRNP mutations that were present at
least five times in the study population, namely D178N and E200K, on anti-PrPC
autoantibody titers: individuals with D178N mutations showed a significant trend towards
lower autoantibody titers in bivariate analysis (table 3). This finding, however, was not
significant after adjusting for age and sample type (table 3). E200K mutation carriers did not
show significant changes in autoantibody reactivity (table 3). The (M)ethionine/(V)aline
polymorphism at codon 129 of the human PRNP gene was reported to affect the
susceptibility to prion diseases

32

. Information on p.129 polymorphism was available in n =

182 of study participants: n = 84 (46.2%) were homozygous for methionine (p.129MM), n =
87 (47.8%) p.129MV, n = 11 (6.0%) p.129VV. None of the polymorphisms significantly

altered autoantibody response to PrPC in a post hoc analysis (table 4). In D178N carriers, the
clinical phenotype was suggested to be dependent on the PRNP cis c.129 polymorphism:
methionine was associated with FFI and valine with fCJD 2, although this association may
not be universal

33, 34

. In our cohort, n = 28 patients could be unambiguously identified as

D178N_cis129M and n = 5 patients as D178N_cis129V. No differences in mean antibody
reactivity were seen between those two groups (table 4).
Co-occurrence of multiple autoimmune diseases is a commonly observed phenomenon 35. In
order to test the influence of pre-existing autoimmune diseases on anti-PrPC autoantibody
titers we searched clinical reports of study participants for presence of autoimmune disease
and other immunological disorders. We were able to retrieve this information in n = 141 (69.8
%) of cases: n = 8 individuals were diagnosed with autoimmune disease, namely
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (n = 3), Graves’ disease (n = 1), monoclonal gammopathy of
unknown significance (n = 1), multiple sclerosis (n = 1), psoriasis (n = 1) and rheumatoid
arthritis (n = 1). Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for age, gender and type of
blood sample did not show a significant association of autoimmune disease with anti-PrPC
autoantibody titers (table 4).
Temporal evolution of anti-PrPC autoantibodies. 44 individuals (21.8 %) donated blood
multiple times, several months apart on which we performed a post hoc, time course
analysis. PRNP wild-type individuals were observed over a longer time period compared to
PRNP mutations carriers (17 ± 1.78 months vs. 10 ± 6.21 months, p = 1.42 x 10-5). PRNP
mutation carriers showed larger variability in autoantibody titers, mean proportional change
per year was, however, similar across groups (p = 0.23) and was overall negligible between
two blood drawings (113.2 ± 61.44 % per year in PRNP mutation carriers versus 99.95 ±
17.22 % per year in PRNP wild-type individuals, figure 2C). None of the PRNP mutation
carriers tested in this time course analysis exhibited clinical signs of prion disease.

Discussion
The diagnosis of a disease-associated PRNP mutation is a fateful and often devastating
event for individuals carrying such mutations. The clinical penetrance of PRNP mutations
can be very high, and no disease-modifying therapy is available as of today 2. Clinical signs
of familial prion disease typically erupt in late adulthood although carriers arguably produce
the mutated protein from the first day of their life 5. There are at least two scenarios that may
account for this phenomenon: (1) the pathogenic mutations may slightly destabilize PrPC,
thereby infinitesimally increasing the probability of pathological aggregation, or (2) the
pathogenic conformation of PrPC is attained early on, but the body’s defenses stave off its
consequences for many decades.
In the case of scenario #1, extensive structural studies on pathogenic PrPC variants failed to
reveal major structural alterations 20. We hypothesized that under scenario #2, the stochastic
generation of PrPSc in mutation carriers might engender neoantigens, which in turn might
lead to protective humoral responses. Remarkably, however, we found no evidence of
induction of humoral antibody-mediated immunity against PrPC by pathogenic PRNP
variants. Instead, our study suggests the prevalence of naturally occurring anti-PrPC
antibodies in the general population independent of clinical signs of prion disease, PRNP
variant or PRNP p.129 polymorphism. Although reactivity to wild-type PrP has been reported
in the serum of E219K homozygotes

10

, and reactivity to a non-naturally-occurring PrP

peptide was reported in commercial IgG 9, the present report is to our knowledge the first
observation of the PRNP genotype-independent presence of autoantibodies to full-length,
wild-type PrP in humans. Without disease-specific antibodies, one might speculate that
PRNP mutations accumulate subclinical levels of prions to a point when clinical symptoms
become evident.
In a subset of individuals, anti-PrPC autoantibody reactivity was tested in multiple blood
drawings up to 1.5 years apart: the mean change of autoantibody titers was similar across

PRNP genotypes in line with previous reports that showed stable autoantibody levels at least
over several years 36, 37.
Matching in case-controls studies is a controversial topic

38

. In our study, initial analyses

were performed on unmatched cohorts adjusted for known confounders of blood
autoantibody levels, this approach was described to increase statistical power

39

. To

strengthen our arguments, we compared anti-PrPC autoantibody levels in cases and
matched controls, these results are in line with findings from the unmatched cohorts.
An increasing number of autoantibodies against neurodegenerative targets are being
explored as biomarkers and as potential therapeutics. Naturally occurring autoantibodies
against hyperphosphorylated tau protein have been isolated from several asymptomatic
blood donors

40

. Researchers from Neurimmune (Switzerland) recently reported the

development of a fully human antibody against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis targeting
pathologically misfolded SOD1, α-miSOD1, from a memory B-cell library from healthy elderly
individuals 41. Phase III trials involving aducanumab, a bona fide human antibody with potent

β-amyloid clearing capabilities, were, however, stopped prematurely 42.
In previous works, we found that anti-PrPC antibodies can efficaciously counteract prions 6 –
a finding which was later confirmed by several other researchers 43. We speculated that antiPrPC autoantibodies from the general population could represent a reservoir of potential
therapeutic agents against prion diseases. We find, however, that the distribution of titers
appears similar between mutation carriers and controls, and between symptomatic and presymptomatic mutation carriers, arguing against the possibility that these autoantibodies are
broadly beneficial. This is at variance with a previous, pre-clinical report claiming
neuroprotective effects for naturally occurring antibodies to a PrP peptide 9. Similarly,
naturally occurring anti-β-amyloid autoantibodies with neuroprotective effects were reported
in mice, but did not meet primary cognitive endpoints when tested in a phase III clinical trial
44

.

Nonetheless, our work does not rule out the possibility of protective anti-PrP autoantibodies
in the general population or in PRNP mutation carriers specifically. Our study was restricted
to the assessment of autoantibody levels against full-length, wild-type, recombinant human
PrPC . We did not evaluate the presence of antibodies specific to pathogenic PRNP
mutations or to neoepitopes created by those mutations. Moreover, it is possible that
humans develop antibodies specific to PrPSc, the aggregated form of the prion protein. In our
experience such anti-PrPSc antibodies tend to cross-react, at least to some level, with PrPC
45

. Another difficulty is that PrPSc structure is very heterogenous in genetic prion diseases:

while brains from genetic CJD and sCJD patients show similar patterns of PrPSc, PrPSc is
fragmented and of low molecular weight in brains from GSS patients and can show marked
variation in individuals with the D178N mutation

2, 46

.

Future studies will focus on the

detection of rare, low-titer anti-PrPSc antibodies which may possess unique prion-clearing
properties.
