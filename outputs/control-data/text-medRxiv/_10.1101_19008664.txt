Abstract
Objectives
This systematic review aims to assess the quality of literature supporting surgical interventions
for paediatric extravasation injury and to determine and summarize their outcomes.

Methods
We performed a systematic review by searching Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as
AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to February 2019. All
studies other than case reports were eligible for inclusion if the population was younger than
18 years old, there was a surgical intervention aimed at treating extravasation injury and they
reported on outcomes. Risk of bias was graded according to the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) study quality assessment tools.

Results
26 studies involving 728 children were included – one before-and-after study and 25 case
series. Extravasation injuries were mainly confined to skin and subcutaneous tissues but
severe complications were also encountered, including amputation (one toe and one below
elbow). Of the surgical treatments described, the technique of multiple puncture wounds and
instillation of saline and/or hyaluronidase was the most commonly used. However, there were
no studies in which its effectiveness was tested against another treatment or a control and
details of functional and aesthetic outcomes were generally lacking.

Conclusion
There is a lack of high quality evidence to support treatment of extravasation injury in children.
A definitive trial of extravasation injuries, or a centralized extravasation register using a
universal grading scheme and core outcome set with adequate follow-up, are required to
provide evidence to guide clinician decision-making.

Strengths and Limitations
•

A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and registered on
PROSPERO

•

Two authors used a bespoke inclusion/exclusion form to independently assess study
eligibility

•

Studies were eligible for inclusion if the population was younger than 18 years old, if
there was a surgical intervention aimed at treating extravasation injury in any setting
and if they reported on short- or long-term outcomes

•

Two researchers also independently assessed the included studies’ risk of
methodological bias using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study quality
assessment tools

•

18 years old may represent a relatively arbitrary cut-off age to differentiate between
‘paediatric’ and ‘adult’ in terms of extravasation injury

Introduction
Extravasation is the inadvertent leakage of a vesicant solution from its intended vascular
pathway, commonly a peripheral or central vein, into the surrounding tissue with the potential
to harm a patient. A vesicant is any medicine or fluid with the potential to cause blisters,
severe tissue injury or necrosis if there is leakage. 1 If left untreated, extravasations may result
in delayed healing, scarring and functional morbidity, including amputation in severe cases.

Children requiring intravenous (IV) therapy often have multiple risk factors for extravasation
injuries, and neonates are at even greater risk of more serious injury due to poor venous
integrity, capillary leakage, and expandable subcutaneous tissue that accommodates
relatively large volumes of fluid. 2

The reported incidence of extravasation in adult and paediatric inpatients ranges between
0.1% - 6.5% across studies from the UK, USA and Canada, but inconsistent reporting and
documentation means that the true figure is likely to be higher. 2–4

Multiple treatments have been described. The “Gault technique” 5 utilizes multiple small
incisions made around the injury site. These are subsequently used to instill saline and/or
hyaluronidase to wash out the extravasation fluid. This method remains a commonly
described technique for the treatment of more severe paediatric extravasations. However,
there is a lack of high quality comparative studies in which treatments are evaluated against
each other and/or controls. It is therefore not known which of these treatments are effective,
harmful or at the very least, necessary; a conclusion supported by a recent scoping review of
interventions. 6 That review highlighted the fact that the lack of consensus extended to
published guidelines. Their survey also showed wide variation in the frequency of use of the

saline washout techniques in neonatal units across the National Health Service (NHS) in the
UK. This systematic review aims to evaluate the quality of the literature and to summarize the
published outcome data of the surgical management of paediatric extravasation injuries.

Methods
We performed a systematic review of original clinical studies or systematic reviews (excluding
case reports) of paediatric extravasation injury, reported in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 7 statement and using
methodology outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 8
where applicable. The protocol was developed prospectively, locally peer-reviewed and
registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42016045647).

Search methods
Studies were identified through a systematic literature search in Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid
EMBASE as well as AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and clinicaltrials.gov from inception
to February 2019. To identify grey literature, Web of Science was searched using bespoke
searches. Internet-wide searches using Google were employed to identify clinical guidelines
describing the management of extravasation in the UK. All of these strategies comprised
modifications of a common set of terms to identify the relevant clinical area. Key search terms
in this common set included the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) “extravasation of
diagnostic and therapeutic materials", “infant”, “child”, and “preschool”. These MeSH terms
were combined with appropriate Boolean operators [Supplementary 1]. The index search
terms were then combined with free text terms to identify appropriate clinical studies. No
language restrictions were imposed.
The search results were merged and, after screening, duplicate citations were discarded along
with studies unrelated to the research objective.

Criteria for selecting studies
Study selection criteria were determined in advance during the protocol stage. Two authors
used a bespoke inclusion/exclusion form to independently assess eligibility of the title and
abstracts of the search results. [Supplementary 2] Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), quasiexperimental and cross-sectional studies and case-series were eligible for inclusion if the
population was younger than 18 years old, if there was a surgical intervention aimed at
treating extravasation injury in any setting and if they reported on short- or long-term
outcomes. Any disparities regarding inclusion of articles were discussed between the authors
and a joint decision was made based on the inclusion criteria.

Assessment of Bias

Two researchers also independently assessed the included studies’ risk of methodological
bias using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study quality assessment tools 9 for “case
series” and for “before-after studies with no control group” – the two types of included studies.
Discrepancies were resolved by discussions with the other authors.

Results
Search strategy
Our search strategy identified a total of 1,966 research articles of which 220 were potentially
relevant to the research question. Of the 220 papers 185 did not meet the inclusion criteria.
Thirty-five papers were deemed eligible for inclusion after studies in which conservative
management or no intervention were excluded. The requisite data were immediately available
in 26 study reports 4,10,19–28,11,29–34,12–18 and the authors of the remaining nine studies 5,35–42 were
contacted twice with additional requests, mainly for exclusively paediatric extravasation data,
and given at least two months to reply. Unfortunately, none of the authors were able to provide
these data and those studies were excluded. The data were extracted from the remaining 26
studies [Supplementary PRISMA flow-diagram] using a pre-specified (review-specific)
proforma [Supplementary 3] by two researchers, with discrepancies resolved by a third.

Study Characteristics
The included studies were published between 1975 and 2018. The mean sample size was 32
with a range of 4-147 participants. One study was a before-and-after comparative study, 31 two
were prospective case series, 19,24 and the remaining 23 were retrospective case series. The
follow-up periods were not reported in 14 included studies. In the other studies, the follow-up
periods ranged from three days to 15 months [Table 1].

Patient Characteristics
Across the 26 included studies, there were 728 children. The median age of the 68 children for
whom the individual data was available was 0.66 months (interquartile range (IQR) = 5.05).
The mean age of 14 months (range: neonatal to 17 years old) was calculated using the data
for 322 children across 16 included studies. There was a small difference in sex, with 187

males (57%) and 142 females (43%) (data on sex was lacking for 399 children). 19 of the 26
included studies recorded the sites of the implicated cannula for 553 children. The most
common site was the upper limb (n=343; 62%), followed by the lower limb (n=177; 32%) and
then the scalp (n=21; 4%). Ten studies specifically stated whether the cannula was a
peripheral (n=314; 98%) or central line (n=7; 2%). [Table 2]
Of the 16 studies that provided data on comorbidities for 167 children, prematurity was the
most common comorbidity in 11 (n=121; 72%). Malignancy (n=25; 15%) was the main
comorbidity in three studies.
Of the 20 studies that reported on them, the most commonly extravasated substances
affecting 363 children were [Table 3]:
1) Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) – 122 children (34%); most common in eight studies.
2) Intravenous maintenance fluids other than those specifically listed – 70 children (19%);
most common in three studies. Unfortunately the data was not available for the
outcomes of different types of maintenance fluids so they have been grouped together.
3) Calcium-containing products – 32 children (9%); most common in four studies.
4) Dextrose of concentration ≥5% - 28 children (8%); most common in one study.
5) Intravenous antimicrobials – 20 children (6%); most common in no studies. Of those 20
extravasations, five were due to Flucloxacillin with one injury taking 60 days to heal
and five were due to unspecified cephalosporin antibiotics, three of which required skin
grafting. One case of severe contractures and extensor loss on the dorsum of a child’s
hand was due to an unspecified tetracycline antibiotic. There were no individual
outcomes recorded for the seven extravasations of Aciclovir, the single extravasations
of Gentamicin, Ganciclovir or the remaining extravasations involving Flucloxacillin and
cephalosporin antibiotics.

Uncertainty remains over whether there is a difference in the outcomes of children who are
treated conservatively or surgically and the case series that exist cover a number of
treatments for a range of injuries from swelling to full-thickness defects. However, a recent
scoping review found that the outcomes used and results detailed were generally limited, 6
making it difficult for clinicians to rely upon those studies in deciding who to treat
conservatively. This is why we have focused solely on surgical interventions.

The Gault Method
279 children with an average age of 15.3 months were involved in the seven studies looking at
the Gault method. No patients had skin necrosis at presentation.
107 were treated using the Gault method with saline, of which nine (8%) developed full
thickness skin injury / skin necrosis and one (1%) developed compartment syndrome requiring
fasciotomies. Of those with necrosis, six required no surgical intervention and three were
debrided and treated with artificial dermis. [Table 4]
76 were treated using the Gault method with hyaluronidase, of which three (4%) developed
skin necrosis and were all managed conservatively.
One child received only hyaluronidase injections and developed necrosis, which healed
spontaneously.
95 children received no treatment, of which ten (11%) developed necrosis (one of whom went
on to lose three toes), three (3%) developed an associated infection, one (1%) had an
ischaemic toe requiring amputation and one (1%) developed calcinosis cutis.

Debridement and further surgery
There were 137 children with an average age of 17.7 months across the 14 studies in the
debridement and further surgery group.

Nine studies (98 children) used management plans comprising debridement and further
surgery in combination with conservative measures, details of which are shown in Table 4.
10,13–15,21,23,25,30,32

Of those 98 children, 34 (35%) had established full thickness skin injury / skin

necrosis at presentation and 28 (29%) developed necrosis after conservative measures. 84
children (86%) underwent mechanical debridement as part of their treatment. The vast
majority of children’s wounds healed with minimal scarring and no functional deficit but four
(4%) had debilitating scar contractures necessitating further surgery, ten (10%) required skin
grafts, and two (2%) required fasciocutaneous flaps.
The other five studies (39 children) used only debridement and further surgery. All of those 39
children had full thickness skin injury / skin necrosis at presentation. 30 (77%) underwent
mechanical debridement, of whom 22 (56%) required further operations including skin grafts
and fasciocutaneous flaps and two developed contractures. The remaining nine children
(23%), all from one study, underwent Versajet hydrosurgery with good healing in all children
and one requiring sharp debridement.
In total, of the 137 children in the debridement and further surgery group, 103 (75%)
developed skin necrosis, all of whom (in addition to some of those who were yet to develop
necrosis, total n=123 (89%)) received either mechanical or water jet debridement. At least 38
children (28%) went on to require further operations.

Hyaluronidase injections
The final group of studies used hyaluronidase injections at the extravasation site without the
need for incisions or washouts. This group comprised six studies and 327 children.
12,18,22,31,33,34

97 children received hyaluronidase injections, one (1%) of whom had skin necrosis at
presentation that resolved, and one (1%) developed necrosis requiring further surgery. Of the
remaining 230 children that did not receive hyaluronidase, none developed skin necrosis at

any stage, although reporting on the extent of skin damage and eventual outcomes across the
studies was generally poor.

Comparison of the interventions
The Gault Method
Among the studies included in this review, Ghanem et al 19 provides the closest approximation
of a comparative study of the Gault method in children: 48 extravasations were diagnosed and
children were divided into early (<24 hours, n=45) and later (>24 hours, n=3) referrals. Among
early referrals, 22 were deemed to be ‘at risk’ injuries and received washout using Gault’s
method. Skin necrosis occurred in one of 45 early referrals but in two of three later referrals.
The conclusion of this study, that the incidence of necrosis is higher in the later referral group,
is limited by low methodological quality including the use of an arbitrary 24-hour cut-off, the
small size of the later referral group and a lack of data describing the types of vesicants. It is
important to note that the necrosis resolved with conservative management in all three cases.

Of the 183 children treated with a variation of the Gault technique across the included studies,
12 (7%) developed skin necrosis (none had skin necrosis at presentation). This compares
favourably to the 11% (10/95) of children who received no treatment across those same
studies. However, 73% (69/95) of the untreated group were late referrals and may be
expected to have worse outcomes related to time of presentation. The only study to apply the
Gault technique in which plastic surgery review time and patient ages were similar was Ching,
Wong and Milroy. 16 In that study, none of the 43 children treated with Gault’s technique and
hyaluronidase developed any complications whereas there were three cases of associated
infection, one ischaemic toe requiring amputation and one case of calcinosis cutis amongst
the 26 children that received no treatment.

The degree of injury was only recorded for 36 (13%) of the 279 children in the included studies
describing the Gault technique, of which 22 (8%) were full-thickness skin injuries.

Debridement and further surgery
73 children (53%) of the 137 in the debridement and further surgery studies had at least skin
necrosis / full thickness skin injury at presentation
In contrast to the Gault as well as the hyaluronidase injection studies, the degree of injury was
documented for 93% of the children (128/137).

Hyaluronidase injections
One (0.3%) of the 327 children reported in studies describing hyaluronidase injections had
skin necrosis at presentation, and one (0.3%) went on to develop it. The degree of injury was
recorded for only 49 (15%) of the 327 children. The reporting of patient outcomes was
particularly scarce in this group.

Injuries
The types of injury were recorded for 212 of the 728 children across the included studies.
Injuries were limited to swelling, pain or erythema (n=63; 30%), partial-thickness skin injury
such as superficial blistering in others (n=29; 14%) and full-thickness skin injury such as
necrosis in the largest number of children (n=110; 52%). However, these figures are skewed
by the fact that 10 studies only looked at extravasation injuries causing at least skin necrosis.
10,15,17,20,26–30,32

One study described a transient episode of foot ischaemia which resolved with

conservative management and one compartment syndrome of the left forearm requiring
fasciotomies. 20 Two studies described toe amputations secondary to ischaemia. 4,16 One
study of major injuries with full-thickness tissue loss had several casualties including a below

elbow amputation and two episodes of extensor loss. 28 Table 5 demonstrates the huge range
of injury severity encountered and the number of each in the different intervention groups.

Millam’s grading system for extravasation injuries
Several of the included studies 11,13,17,20,22,33 make reference to the four stages of
extravasation/infiltration severity, which was first published by Millam in 1988. 43 This focuses
on presence of pain, erythema, oedema, capillary refill, skin temperature and breakdown and
it has been proposed that stages III & IV may require intervention. 44
In one case series, 33 treatment was determined by the severity of extravasation injury based
on a grading system similar to Millam’s. Of the 18 children, the seven with Grade I and II
injuries were managed conservatively. Ten children had grade III injuries – five were managed
conservatively but the other five who had also developed skin erythema received active
treatment with hyaluronidase injections. The one child with a grade IV injury required excision
of the lesion – the sole surgical intervention in that study – after having been injected with
hyaluronidase. All wounds healed with ‘good outcomes’.

Risk of Bias
The one before-and-after study 31 was evaluated using a separate tool to the other studies
(which were all case series). It was given an overall ‘fair’ rating by both authors. The vast
majority of the case series were rated by both authors as ‘good’ or ‘fair’ [Table 6].
All four of the studies rated as ‘poor’ lacked a clearly defined study population. Compaña,
Míguez & de Toro Santos 23, Harris, Bradley & Moss 24, and von Heimburg & Pallua 29 did not
clearly state their objective whilst Cochran, Bomyea & Kahn 12, Harris, Bradley & Moss and
von Heimburg & Pallua lacked clearly-defined, valid and reliable outcome measures.
Compaña, Míguez & de Toro Santos did not clearly describe the study’s intervention and von
Heimburg & Pallua’s subject were not comparable. In combination, these factors led to the

overall ‘poor’ rating of these four studies, meaning that their results were at high risk of
methodological bias.

Discussion
This paper describes a systematic review of characteristics and operative management of
paediatric extravasation injuries. Our review highlighted three key issues. Firstly, surgical
management is commonly reported in the literature in cases where there is significant soft
tissue injury but as there are no comparative studies, it is unclear whether this is optimal.
Secondly, there are no data to support one surgical management approach over another, or
over no treatment. Thirdly, there are no data on the adverse events caused by the different
surgical interventions.

A variation of the Gault method was used in the largest number of children to receive surgical
treatment across the included studies. Gault 4 described a retrospective case series of 96
patients, ranging in age from newborn to 70 years, who were split into two groups: those seen
within 24 hours of the extravasation and those seen later than this. Patients seen within 24
hours had treatment as per the Gault method while those seen after 24 hours had no
treatment. The original Gault paper was not included in our review because there were no
separate paediatric data available but a separate risk of bias assessment by two authors rated
the study as ‘poor’ due to the lack of a clearly defined objective or population, subjects that
were not comparable and an inadequate length of follow-up. [Table 6] Despite the inherent
limitations in the original Gault study, the method he described is widely used, as
demonstrated by this review where it was a commonly described technique to manage
extravasation injuries. This approach is not without downsides: it is an invasive procedure with
associated morbidity such as pain and possible tendon and nerve damage, and takes
considerable time to perform.

Evidence for the continuing use of the “Gault technique”
The degree of injury was recorded for 13% of the children included in the Gault technique
studies, 93% of those in the debridement and further surgery group and 15% of those in the
hyaluronidase injection group. These figures demonstrate some of the difficulties faced in
drawing comparisons between different interventions, both due to the poor recording of
injuries and because of the fact that accurate documentation of injury severity appears to be
more consistently applied following more severe injuries.
It was not possible to perform pooled analysis from included studies of Gault and alternative
techniques due to study heterogeneity and incomplete outcome reporting.
All but one of the included studies were case series and the one before-and-after study 31
primarily examined the effect of new extravasation treatment guidelines on knowledge of
hyaluronidase, extravasation incident reporting and time from extravasation discovery to
treatment. Therefore, even though they found similar harm scores for the hyaluronidase and
the non-hyaluronidase groups, the results could not be relied upon to assess the effectiveness
of the intervention.
In addition, inclusion criteria varied considerably, details of the injuries were poorly described,
and no studies made direct comparison to another intervention. Finally, detailed outcome
measures following interventions were generally lacking. In summarizing the included studies,
it can be noted that despite widespread use, there is no high-quality evidence to support the
Gault approach or its modifications.

The future of extravasation management
A key conclusion from this review is that resolution of extravasation injuries is common
regardless of the treatment applied. In the absence of data to support one treatment modality
over another, it is imperative that high quality methodology randomized comparisons are

undertaken; however, given the high rate of resolution with conservative treatment, any such
trial will require a large, collaborative and multidisciplinary approach.
Although many of the in the included studies required minimal intervention, full-thickness skin
injury was commonplace; this has the potential for lifelong scarring in patients with an
immature skin barrier such as children and preterm infants in particular. More serious
complications were rare in but given that only a minority of studies reported on longer-term
outcomes, these may underestimate the true burden of extravasation injuries. We suggest the
creation of a core outcome set for extravasation injury treatment and that future studies use
longer-term follow-up to monitor those outcomes.
The use of a universal grading scheme (such as Millam’s 43) to assess the initial extent of
injuries would also aid the comparison between different interventions. However, this requires
meticulous documentation of the appearance of the extravasated site as well as the extent of
tissue damage.

This review was limited by the low methodological quality of included studies and inconsistent
outcome reporting. Variability in baseline data, intervention data and outcome data precluded
formal meta-analysis. These limitations prevent the authors from providing definitive clinical
recommendations either for or against paediatric extravasation, based on the current
evidence.

Conclusion
There is a paucity of evidence to inform surgical treatment of paediatric and neonatal
extravasation injuries. Gault’s technique is a commonly described approach, but we did not
identify any evaluation of its effectiveness compared to other approaches or conservative
management. A centralized extravasation register, use of a standardized and agreed grading
scheme, development of a core outcome set and adequate follow-up of extravasation injuries
are required to provide incidence and outcome data for this condition, and to inform muchneeded, definitive trials of therapeutic approaches to extravasation injuries in children and
neonates.

Intervention Summary

Outcomes
Three patients (7%) suffered injuries, which led to significant tissue necrosis, delayed healing and
prolonged morbidity. None of these were washed out due to delayed referral.

Murphy

Gault’s + saline (11% of patients).

20

Kostogloudis

Gault’s + saline (100% of patients).

All wounds healed within 25 days. One case of distal foot ischaemia resolved after treatment.

24

Harris

Gault’s + saline (100% of patients).

25

Andrés

Gault’s + saline (67% of patients) + Debridement + dermal substitute in 53%

No episodes of skin or soft tissue loss were recorded and no reconstructive surgery was required.
Seven of ten treated with Gault’s method avoided necrosis and recovered fully. Three developed
necrosis and, with the remaining five, were debrided and received artificial skin and obtained
satisfactory outcomes.

11

Casanova

Gault's + hyaluronidase (79% of patients) / + saline (14%)

19

Ghanem

Gault’s + hyaluronidase (46% of patients).

16
Ching
Debridement + further surgery

Gault’s + hyaluronidase (62% of patients).

No skin involvement in ten patients; Blistering healed in one; Necrosis resolved in three
Three patients had tissue necrosis (one of whom received wash out). There was satisfactory healing
with no requirement for surgical intervention.
Of the 62% of patients washed out, none developed complications. Two other significant
complications.
All wounds healed completely with no infections and no functional scar contractions at up to 16
months follow-up. No skin grafts were required.

10

Falcone

Topical fibrinolysin/deoxyribonuclease ointment then debridement.

21

Sung

23

Compaña

Multiple punctures using a scalpel blade + hydrocolloid dressing. Then debridement.
Topical steroids, Burow’s Solution and Silver Sulfadiazine. 3 debridements followed by
split-thickness skin grafts.

25

Andrés (2)

Gault’s + saline (67% of patients) + debridement in 33% + artificial dermis.

30

Weiss

32

Boyar

Wet dressings and repeated economical debridement.
Enzymatic or autolytic debridement before mechanical debridement and application of
dehydrated human amniotic membrane allograft (dHAMA)

13

Cho

Topical antibiotic + anti-inflammatory herbal mixture. 1 debridement. 1 escharotomy.

14

Onesti

Topical collagenase, then debridement, and then Hyalomatrix PA (dermal substitute).

15

Firat

Topical hirudin and antibiotics, then 3% boric acid, then repetitive debridement.

26
27

Linder

Debridement and wound closure: mostly split-thickness skin grafts or delayed primary
closure. All patients had at least 2 operations.

28

Upton

Debridement and skin grafts. All patients needed two or more operations.

Complete closure of significant wounds with minimal soft scars and normal pigmentation
One patient had pigmentation at four weeks, one had a small-sized contracture at 50 days, one had
small linear scar at two years.
18 patients healed fully after 21 days. Four had pathological scars and four had debilitating scar
contractures needing secondary surgery.
Seven patients required split-thickness skin grafting and two required fasciocutaneous flaps. All
recovered well with scar development in four. Minor functional loss in the hands or feet as a result of
scar formation was managed by physiotherapy and pressure garments.
The mean time for wound closure was 49 days (range 10–85 days). Three patients died before
wound closure. At least one patient needed a split-thickness skin graft. One child developed
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. Some children developed permanent joint stiffness.
Two patients experienced contractures, two had extensor loss, one had hair loss, one had loss of
motion and one required further reconstruction.

29

von Heimburg

Debridement, allogeneic donor tissue grafts and autologous split-thickness skin grafts.

After 15 days there was full healing in all five infants

Versajet hydrosurgery for all patients. 1 sharp debridement.

Minimal scar formation with no hypertrophic scarring in any patient.
No patients required surgical intervention for wound healing or had an infection.
Mean harm scores were similar between the group receiving hyaluronidase and the group not
receiving it.

17
Sivrioğlu
Hyaluronidase injections
22

Odom

Injection of hyaluronidase or Phentolamine without incisions.

31

Hanrahan

Injection of hyaluronidase.

All patients showed favourable results without functional deficits or conspicuous scars
Of four patients, two successfully healed, one was lost to follow-up and one died of other causes.
Seven of the ten patients treated with Gault’s method avoided necrosis and recovered fully. Three
developed necrosis. The five who were debrided and received artificial skin obtained satisfactory
outcomes.
Wounds healed well in 15 to 40 days. Scars were visible but without discolouration

33

Yan (2017)

Injection of hyaluronidase in 33% (1 patient requiring surgical excision of a lesion)

All healed and had “good outcomes”

34

Myers

Injection of hyaluronidase in 50%

Time to healing averaged 16.2 days (range 1-82 days). No patient required surgical intervention.

12

Cochran

Injection of hyaluronidase in 25%

18

Yan (2014)

Injection of hyaluronidase and application of hirudoid.

One patient had a prolonged course with swelling and skin peeling of the hand.
Three patients lost to follow-up. Negligible loss of functional movements. One case of scarring and
readmission with calcinosis.
