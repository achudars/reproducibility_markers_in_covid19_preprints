Abstract

Uncertainty about the relative importance of modes of influenza transmission, particularly
airborne droplet nuclei (aerosols), fuels controversy concerning recommendations for healthcare
worker protection during pandemics. In-depth review by an expert panel, a proof-of-concept
study, and an international workshop concluded that human challenge-transmission studies in
well-controlled environments would be the most promising approach to fill this critical
knowledge gap. Healthy, seronegative volunteer ‘Donors’ (n=52) were randomly selected for
intranasal challenge with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2). Seronegative ‘Recipients’
randomized to Intervention (IR, n=40) or Control (CR, n=35) groups were exposed to Donors for
four days. IRs wore face shields and hand sanitized frequently to limit large droplet and contact
transmission. Intranasal inoculation produced an infection rate of 81% (42/52); 60% (25/42) of
infected Donors had influenza-like illness, 14% (6/42) had fever, and 26% (11/42) had mild or
no symptoms. Viral aerosol shedding was observed from 26% (11/42) of the infected Donors.
One transmitted infection was confirmed by serology in a CR, yielding a SAR of 2.9% among
CR, 0% in IR (p=0.47 for group difference), and 1.3% overall. The SAR observed was
significantly less than 16% (p<0.001) expected based on the proof-of-concept study SAR
considering that there were twice as many Donors and days of exposure. The main difference
between these studies was mechanical building ventilation in the follow-on study, suggesting a
possible role for aerosols. The low SAR suggests human challenge studies cannot provide
definitive evidence regarding modes of transmission.

Significance Statement

To our knowledge, this is the largest human influenza challenge-transmission study undertaken
to date. The low overall secondary attack rate shows that, as currently implemented, the
challenge-transmission model results in negligible transmission. The significantly lower than
expected secondary attack rate, based on the results of the prior proof-of-concept study, was
possibly attributable to greater ventilation in the current study, and adds to evidence that limiting
exposure to infectious droplet-nuclei (aerosols) may make an important contribution to
controlling influenza transmission. The negligible transmission suggests that current challengetransmission models are less likely to be able to resolve questions about transmission modes than
community-based studies employing environmental monitoring and state-of-the-art deep
sequencing-based molecular epidemiological methods.

Introduction

Influenza virus is a pathogen of global health significance, but human-to-human transmission
remains poorly understood. In particular, the relative importance of the different modes of
transmission (direct and indirect contact, large droplet, and aerosols (airborne droplet nuclei))
remains uncertain during symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (1–4).

The evidence base for influenza transmission is derived from studies that have assessed: virus
deposition and survival in the environment; the epidemiology of disease; pharmaceutical and
non-pharmaceutical interventions; animal models; and mathematical models of transmission.
Those approaches have yet to produce conclusive data quantifying the relative importance of
human-human transmission modes (1, 2).

Infection control guidance for pandemic and seasonal influenza assumes that most transmission
occurs during symptomatic infection, predominantly via large droplet spread at short range (12m) (1). Thus, social distancing measures are often proposed to mitigate the spread and impact
of a pandemic; and hand washing and respiratory etiquette are promoted to reduce transmission.
Evidence to support the possibility of aerosol transmission has grown over recent years (5–7).
and leads to controversies about when and if filtering facepiece respirators (and other precautions
designed to prevent inhalation of aerosols) versus surgical masks (mainly capable of reducing
large droplets and some fine particles) should be used to protect healthcare workers, particularly
during a severe pandemic (1, 3, 4, 8–10).

An expert panel, after in-depth review of the challenges facing community- and workplace-based
intervention studies and their failure thus far to provide definitive evidence regarding the relative
contribution of the various modes, concluded that a human challenge-transmission study would
be a more promising direction for future research (11). Influenza challenge studies in humans
have been conducted to investigate disease pathogenesis and the efficacy of antivirals and
vaccines. Challenge studies assessing human-to-human transmission had not been performed
(11). In 2009, we demonstrated proof-of-concept that healthy seronegative volunteers inoculated
intranasally with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (A/WI), an H3N2 virus, would develop
symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and, under two days of household-like conditions
without environmental controls, transmit infection to other seronegative volunteers. This
suggested that larger scale human challenge-transmission models might be useful to evaluate
transmission modes. A subsequent international workshop discussed the potential that human
challenge-transmission studies, with appropriate interventions, monitoring of aerosol shedding,
and environmental controls, could provide definitive results (12). Here, we report a large followon study, including design factors (Figure 1) aimed at assessing the importance of aerosol
transmission in human-to-human transmission of influenza virus.

Results

Participation and safety. Between January and June 2013, 496 seronegative (HAI≤10)
volunteers underwent study-specific screening and 166 entered the quarantine unit, of whom 127
proved suitable for final study entry (Figure 2 – trial profile; SI Appendix 3 – volunteer baseline
characteristics). Thirty-nine subjects were discharged before inoculation or exposure per protocol

as described in methods. Three separate quarantine EEs took place in March, April, and June
2013 involving Q1: 41 (20 Donors; 11 CR; 10 IR), Q2: 31 (12 Donors; 9 CR; 10 IR) and Q3: 55
(20 Donors; 15 CR; 20 IR) subjects respectively, with 4 Donors and 4 to 7 Recipients per
exposure group. No serious adverse events were recorded in volunteers who commenced the
study.

Environmental control. In Q1 relative humidity averaged 40% (Standard Deviation 9%), room
temperature averaged 20.2 oC (0.4 oC) and CO2 concentration averaged 1430ppm (110ppm). For
Q2 and Q3, respectively, the corresponding values were 44% (4%), 21.4oC (0.3 oC), 1810ppm
(160ppm), and 57% (4%), 21.4oC (0.3 oC), 1810ppm (160ppm). Outdoor CO2 concentration
proxies, taken from the average of CO2 measurements during 2:00am-3:00am were 418, 435, and
422 ppm, for Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively.

Donor status. Donor status is summarised by quarantine study in Table 1. Over all quarantines
combined, intranasal inoculation produced an infection rate of 81% (42/52) among inoculated
volunteers. Of the 42 lab-confirmed infected Donors 25 (60%) had ILI and 10 (24%) were
classified as asymptomatic (4 in Q1, 4 in Q2, and 2 in Q3).

Ten Donors had greater than anticipated immunity on admission, as identified by retrospective
serology (HAI>10 or MN≥80). Four of the 10 seroconverted (i.e. had a 4-fold rise in HAI or MN
titres) between admission to quarantine and follow-up. Five of the 10 met laboratory case
definition by qRT-PCR including all four who seroconverted. The one additional qRT-PCR
positive case had positive swabs on study days 2 and 3 in Q2.

Virus shedding by donors. Overall, 36 Donors had nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) that tested
positive by PCR for A/WI. Of these 36: 53% (n=19) were positive on day 1 post-challenge; 94%
(34) on day 2; 97% (35) on day 3; 86% (31) on day 4; 92% (33) on day 5; and 67% (24) on day 6
(Figure 3).

Aerosol shedding was determined for 25 Donors on day 1, 31 on day 2, 30 on day 3, and 24 on
day 4, and for a total of 36 person-days in Q1, 34 person-days in Q2, and 40 person-days in Q3.
Aerosol shedding from infected Donors, detected in Gesundheit-II samples, is summarised in
Table 2. Six (7%) of the coarse and 14 (16%) of the fine aerosol samples had detectable viral
RNA. We observed aerosol shedding from 11 (26%) of the 42 successfully infected Donors. The
geometric mean (GM) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) for coarse and fine aerosol viral
RNA copy numbers per 30-min sample were 3.1E+3 (3.3) and 5.3E+3 (4.6), respectively. The
maximum levels of shedding into coarse and fine aerosols were 2.79E+4 and 8.02E+4 RNA
copies, respectively (Figure 3).

Recipient status. Recipient status is shown in Table 3. There were similar rates of symptomatic
non-ILI and ILI in both IR and CR groups; no Recipient developed fever. One infection was
confirmed by serology (HAI increased from ≤10 to 40 and MN increased from 10 to 320) in a
CR subject who was symptomatic and whose symptoms met the definition of ILI, but whose
qRT-PCR evaluations were persistently negative. Two other CR were transiently qRT-PCR
positive but neither met laboratory positivity criteria. Both were asymptomatic and had no

change from baseline serology. Thus, there was only one, confirmed transmission event. The CR
and IR group SARs (2.9% and 0%) were not significantly different (p=0.47).

To compare these results with the SAR from the proof-of-concept study, we recomputed the
latter results using the current, more stringent outcome criteria. The adjusted proof-of-concept
SAR was 8.3% giving an expected SAR of 16%. The observed SAR for the current study was
not significantly different than that of the adjusted SAR from the proof-of-concept study, but was
significantly lower than the expected doubling of the SAR (1.3% overall, p<0.0001; and 2.9%
for CR, p=0.035). Comparisons of observed and expected SAR using the proof-of-concept study
outcome definitions were also statistically significant (p<0.0001, SI Appendix 4).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest human influenza challenge-transmission study undertaken
to date. We applied measures to control and standardise environmental conditions and ventilation
rates within and between exposure events, to emulate as far as possible indoor winter conditions
when respiratory virus spread is maximal. We particularly sought to maintain low humidity
conditions which have been associated with enhanced transmission (13) and increased virus
viability (14), together with a low ventilation rate to maximize recipient exposure to airborne
virus. The near absence of transmission to control Recipients suggests contact and large droplet
spray did not contribute substantially to transmission under the conditions used in these EEs. The
significantly lower than expected SAR in this study compared with the proof-of-concept study,
which had much lower ventilation rates, suggests aerosols as an important mode of influenza

virus transmission in this model. The overall low SAR suggests that Donors in this model were
minimally contagious and prevents definitive assessment of the modes of transmission.

Having reported an SAR of 25% (3/12) in our earlier proof-of-concept study, we expected to
observe an SAR of >25%, having doubled both the duration of the exposure and the number of
Donors in each quarantine (15). Indeed, the study was designed to examine an SAR of 40% in
CR versus 20% in IR which would have required 125 Recipient volunteers; this was not met
(n=75) and the study was underpowered.

However, the outcome criteria used in the proof-of-concept study, which included as positive a
single NPS positive by qRT-PCR without seroconversion, were made more stringent in the
present study by requiring two or more NPS positive by qRT-PCR in the absence of
seroconversion (SI Appendix 4). Applying the proof-of-concept criteria to the current study
gives an SAR of 4% (3/75) overall, while applying the stricter criteria used in this study to the
proof-of-concept study gives an SAR of 8.3% (1/12) rather than 25%. Given the lower than
planned enrolment and the stricter outcome criteria, this study was doubly underpowered.

The SAR reported here were well below expectations and were significantly lower than the
expected SAR based on design changes developed to at least double the SAR. These
observations raise two questions: 1) Why were SARs, using stringent criteria, low in both studies
and what are the implications for future human challenge-transmission studies? 2) Why was the
SAR significantly lower in the present study compared with the expected doubling of the rate
observed for the proof-of-concept?

The low SAR in these studies suggests that, unless a much greater SAR can be achieved, type II
error associated with underpowering will be a major obstacle to successful use of human
challenge-transmission studies. Potential areas to consider addressing in order to raise the SARs
in future studies include the virus used, the route of inoculation, susceptibility of the human
volunteers, the rate of viral shedding into NPS and aerosols, and reducing ventilation of exposure
rooms.

In the proof-of-concept (2009) and follow-on (2013) studies we used a GMP A/WI challenge
virus manufactured by Baxter BioScience (Vienna, Austria). Both studies produced similar
clinical and serological infection rates (typically 60-70% and 70-75%, respectively) after
inoculation via nasal instillation, and similar spectrums of clinical illness severity in Donors. The
illnesses we observed were similar to the range seen in healthy adults in the community, from
asymptomatic to febrile symptomatic infection (16). Thus, skewed illness severity does not seem
to explain the low SAR.

The virus preparation has been used in other human challenge studies with similar rates of
infection via nasal instillation (17). Using deep sequencing, Sobel Leonard and colleagues
showed that a sample of the Baxter stock “was at least partially adapted” to the egg and/or tissue
environments in which it was produced (17). They also found that nasal instillation of the stock
into human volunteers resulted in rapid purification selection, although a fixed variant in the HA
gene remained. We have performed a BLAST search and identified the fixed variant
(G70A/D8N) in deposited sequences of wild-type H3N2 viruses. This suggests that, on its own,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014381; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

the fixed HA variant is unlikely to have been a key alteration. These results suggest that it is
unlikely that the virus stock was the primary cause of the low SARs. But, the impact of positive
selection of the challenge virus for growth in the production environment, rather than for human
transmissibility, remains a potential contributing factor to consider in choosing challenge viruses
for future transmission studies.

The route of infection with influenza virus is known to matter in the setting of experimental
infection, with aerosolized virus infectious at lower doses and more likely to result in ‘typical
influenza-like disease’ (fever plus cough) than intranasal inoculation (18, 19). This anisotropic
property (20) of influenza virus is not unique among respiratory viruses; e.g. it is exploited by
the live, unattenuated adenovirus vaccine (21). The implication for human challengetransmission studies, however, may be that increased rates of lower respiratory tract infection via
aerosol inoculation might be required to achieve sufficiently high rates of donors with fever,
cough, and contagiousness to achieve a useful SAR.

In the current quarantine-based human challenge-transmission model, consistent with historical
precedent, screening for susceptibility was undertaken primarily by HAI antibody screening,
although it is recognised that screening by MN titre or other assays (22, 23) could be an
alternative or adjunctive approach. The exact correlates of immunity and severity using novel
immunological assays have not been validated and selecting subjects based on these assays
would have added substantial complexity and costs. Six Donors and five Recipients in the
present study were discovered, in retrospect, to have seroconverted during the 3 to 56-day
interval prior to entering the quarantine facility, despite having as short a delay as possible

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014381; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

between final screening for HAI and quarantine entry. However, the majority of Donors and
Recipients were susceptible according to the results of microneutralization tests. Prior immunity,
as measured by the HAI and MN assays, does not therefore, appear to have been a major
limitation nor account for failure to transmit from readily infected Donors to identically screened
Recipients. Regarding future studies, as novel immune correlates of influenza protection and
severity become established, additional approaches beyond HAI and MN assays could be
employed for volunteer selection. This might enable selection of those likely to become infected,
febrile, and have greater symptomatology including more frequent and greater levels of cough
and runny nose. Unfortunately, such screening might also dramatically reduce the yield of
suitable volunteers and substantially increase overall study costs.

Results from serial nasopharyngeal swabs in Donors indicate that over 80% were positive by
qRT-PCR testing on one or more post-challenge days. Thus, failure to shed virus into nasal
secretions cannot explain the low SARs. The results from breath sampling with the Gesundheit-II
device indicate that 26% (11/42) of infected Donors had virus detectable in exhaled air during
the same period. By comparison, virus shedding into exhaled breath was detected in 84% (119 of
142) of symptomatically presenting influenza cases sampled on one to three days post onset of
symptoms, mostly recruited from young adults on a college campus (7). When compared on a
per-sample basis, infected Donors shed detectable virus less frequently than naturally infected
college campus cases (7) in both coarse (7% and 40%, respectively) and fine aerosols (15% and
76%); all assays for both groups were performed in the same laboratory using the same methods.
However, when the comparison was limited to positive aerosol samples from each study
population, the average quantities of virus detected were similar (within 1 log), for the Donors as

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014381; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

for the college community cases (GM coarse 3.1E+3 and 1.2E+4, GM fine 5.3E+3 and 3.8E+4,
respectively). The maximum exhaled breath viral aerosol from the 11 Donors was two to four
logs lower than from the college campus cases (maximum coarse 2.8E+4 and 4.3E+8, and
maximum fine 8.0E+4 and 4.4E+7, respectively) (7). While this difference may merely represent
the low probability of sampling from the tail of a log-normal distribution with only 11, as
compared with 119 cases, it may be relevant to the low SAR in the challenge-transmission model
if aerosols disseminated by rare supershedders account for most transmission. If aerosols are
largely derived from the lower respiratory tract, as has been suggested by analysis of the college
community cases, this would also suggest that future challenge-transmission studies should
employ methods designed to increase the frequency of lower respiratory tract infection.

The proof-of-concept study was conducted in a hotel room with closed windows and thermal
control provided only by a recirculating air conditioning unit. While the ventilation rate was not
measured, it was likely to have been extremely low for the number of occupants, with only
small, intermittent, bathroom extract and natural building infiltration providing fresh air. The
ventilation rate of 4 l/s/person during the main study was low compared to 10 l/s/person
recommended in UK design standards (24) but was likely substantially greater than in the proofof-concept study. This would have produced significantly higher viral aerosol concentrations
during the proof-of-concept EEs, assuming similar generation rates from Donors in both
experiments. Given that the Donors in the two studies were similar in other respects, differences
in shedding rates seem unlikely. Therefore, the difference in SAR between this study and the
expected SAR based on design changes and prior results are possibly due to differing ventilation
conditions. The implication for future challenge-transmission studies, given that the ventilation

rate in the current study was as low as possible with a single pass ventilation system, is that
recirculating air conditioning systems similar to that in the proof-of-concept study should be
employed to limit dilution ventilation and maximize exposure to aerosols. This will be especially
important if Donors in future studies continue to represent the lower end of the aerosol shedding
spectrum seen in naturally infected cases.

Achieving temperature and humidity to simulate winter conditions was challenging, particularly
in Q3, conducted in June 2013 when the average external conditions were 16oC and 64% relative
humidity. It was necessary to strike a balance between volunteer comfort and conditions
favourable to transmission, both of which were constrained by the capability of the mechanical
systems in the building. However, the relative humidity in the current study overlapped with that
during the proof-of-concept study, which ranged between 38 and 53%, and thus, eliminated
humidity as a potential explanation for the difference in transmission rates.

Despite this study not having produced the planned SAR, it yields important findings. First,
although fewer viral challenged subjects had virus-laden aerosols than seen in people with
natural infections presenting with influenza-like symptoms, those volunteers who did produce
viral aerosols did so at a rate similar to the average symptomatic naturally infected case. Second,
given that a subset of the infected volunteers had moderate viral aerosol shedding in this model,
observation of transmission via aerosols in quarantine studies may be strongly dependent on the
dilution ventilation rate. Third, low risk of transmission to Control Recipients suggests that
contact and large droplet spray transmission were not important modes of transmission in this
model. The overall low SAR compared to that observed in the proof-of-concept study suggests

that, given the main difference between the studies was the indoor air ventilation rate, aerosol
transmission may be an important mode of influenza virus transmission between adults. Finally,
sensitivity of transmission to details of the Donors selected, environment, and activity during
exposure events, suggest that if a successful transmission model can be developed, carefully
designed studies may be useful for investigating specific, targeted intervention strategies for
prevention of specific transmission modalities. However, sensitivity to experimental conditions
also demonstrates that it will be challenging to generalize the results of the quarantine-based
transmission model to broad conclusions about the relative importance of aerosol, droplet spray,
and contact modes of transmission. These complexities of the challenge-transmission model
suggest that community-based transmission studies employing deep-sequencing based molecular
epidemiologic methods in natural experiments, e.g. comparing high and low ventilation
dormitories or barracks, may be more attractive alternatives than previously thought.
Unfortunately, although an important role for aerosols in transmission of influenza, at least
between adults, is hinted at when comparing the proof-of-concept and current studies, this
challenge model cannot provide a definitive answer to the importance of this mode for influenza
virus transmission between humans.

Materials and Methods

Overview. The randomized challenge-transmission trial took place from March to June 2013 in a
closed quarantine facility, with written informed consent from healthy volunteers in accordance
with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, in compliance with UK regulatory and ethical
(IRB) requirements (under auspices of the UK Health Research Authority (HRA) National

Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee London – City & East; reference number
12/LO/1277), and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01710111). Volunteers,
screened for serologic susceptibility, were randomly selected for intranasal challenge with A/WI
(15) – becoming ‘Donors’. After allowing for a short incubation period, Donors were introduced
to other sero-susceptible volunteers – ‘Recipients’ – under controlled household-like conditions
for four days. Recipients were randomised as Intervention Recipients (IR) or Control Recipients
(CR). IRs wore face shields evaluated to interrupt large droplet transmission but to be permissive
to aerosols (SI Appendix 1); in addition, IRs hand sanitised (using alcohol-based Deb®
InstantFOAM, 72% ethyl alcohol) once every 15 minutes to minimise the possibility of contact
transmission. IRs were only allowed to touch face via single-use wooden spatulas. Thus, IRs
would be exposed to influenza only via aerosols. CRs did not wear face shields or use hand
sanitiser and were allowed to touch face freely; therefore, CRs would have been exposed via all
routes of transmission consistent with close proximity human-human contact. Figure 1 shows an
overview of the study design. Comparisons were made between groups using Fisher’s exact test
for binomial proportions and between observed and expected outcomes using binomial tests. All

Maryland (25) and https://gitlab.com/jacobbueno/emit_quarantine_main.

Influenza Virus. Influenza A/WI manufactured and processed under current good
manufacturing practices (cGMP) was obtained from Baxter BioScience, (Vienna, Austria).
Stocks of this virus preparation have been sequenced and its evolution in the upper respiratory
track of inoculated volunteers extensively analysed (17).

Screening. Volunteers were screened from 3-56 days in advance of the experiment to determine
humoral immunity to A/WI before undergoing further screening against inclusion and exclusion
criteria (SI Appendix 2). Volunteers needed to be healthy, between the ages of 18 and 45 years,
not living with anyone deemed at high risk of influenza complications on discharge, and not to
have had a seasonal influenza vaccine in the last 3 years. Blood samples from volunteers were
collected immediately before quarantine entry for repeat serology, although results were not
available until after the study. An initial screening haemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) titre
of ≤10 was considered evidence of susceptibility to infection.

Power calculation. We calculated, based on the reported SAR of the proof-of-concept study
(15) (SI Appendix 2), that over a range of scenarios the statistical power of the whole study
would be 63%-84%, typically 80% in the most realistic scenario, if a sample size of 125
Recipients was achieved (70 IR, 55 CR). To increase the SAR from that observed in the proofof-concept study, we opted to inoculate 4 (rather than 2) Donors per 5 Recipients and to conduct
exposure events on days 1-4 (rather than 2-3) post inoculation.

Pre-exposure. Screened, eligible, volunteers entered a closed, quarantine unit on Day -2 and
were randomised to Donor or Recipient (IR and CR) groups; thereafter Donors and Recipients
were segregated. Donors and Recipients were immediately screened for a panel of 7 imported
‘contaminant’ respiratory viruses (influenza A, B; adenovirus; respiratory syncytial virus;
parainfluenza 1, 2, 3) by a direct fluorescence antibody assay (DFA) (LIGHT DIAGNOSTICS™
SimulFluor1 Respiratory Screen, Merck Millipore) and any with a positive test were

immediately discharged. On day 0, Donors were inoculated intranasally, via pipette in a supine
position, with 0.5ml per nostril of a suspension containing 5.5 log10TCID50/ml of influenza A/WI
(26, 27).

Exposure Events. The study was conducted in three, separate, identically-designed quarantine
events (Q1, Q2, and Q3). From Day 1 to Day 4 of each quarantine event, all volunteers took part
in an Exposure Event (EE). Individual Donors and Recipients were each allocated to a single
exposure room per day where they interacted at close distances for approximately 15 hours/day,
for four consecutive days. In-room staff supervised activities such as playing board games, pool,
and table football, and watching films, whilst ensuring that volunteers mixed freely, and that IRs
complied with face shield use, hand sanitisation, and no-touch-face rules. Donor, IR and CR
groups were moved into different corners of the rooms for meal breaks, and Donor and Recipient
groups were housed separately at night, including further separation and withdrawal of any
Recipients with symptoms to prevent any contamination of the results by Recipient-Recipient
secondary transmission. Five exposure rooms were used ranging from 17-30m2 floor area and
50-87m3 volume. Four Donors were non-randomly allocated to each exposure group to ensure
even distribution of subjects actively shedding virus. This was achieved by assessing symptom
scores and the results of influenza rapid tests (Quidel Sofia®) performed on Days 1 and 2. From
Day 2 onwards, Donors remained in their allocated group and were not redistributed further.
Once assigned to an exposure group, Recipients remained in the same group until the end of the
EE or until they developed ILI and were withdrawn to a separate isolation area. On each day of
EE, each exposure group rotated to a different exposure room.

Environmental controls. Each exposure room was assessed pre-quarantine by building and
ventilation engineers and modified to achieve a ventilation rate of approximately
4L/second/person (based on planned occupancy during EEs), temperature 18-22oC, and relative
humidity 45-65%, to produce conditions favourable to influenza transmission (13), balanced
against tolerability for occupants, and the capability of building systems to provide controlled
environments comparable across all three quarantine studies. During each EE, rooms were
monitored at 5-minute intervals for CO2 concentration (as a proxy for ventilation rate),
temperature and humidity; heating, cooling and humidity were remotely adjusted to maintain
optimal conditions.

Clinical assessment. All subjects underwent thrice daily monitoring of respiratory and systemic
symptoms; each symptom was reported as grade 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). Paired venous
blood specimens for serology were taken on Day -2 and Day 28. NPS were taken daily from all
subjects. Respiratory specimens were analysed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRTPCR) and serological specimens by HAI and microneutralisation (MN) assays. The qRT-PCR
and HAI were performed in duplicate at the MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus
Research (with Fast Track Diagnostics qRT-PCR kit) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta; MN assays were performed by CDC as described previously
(28).

Exhaled breath sampling. Donors were assigned to provide exhaled breath samples on two,
randomly selected days within the exposure event, collected using a Gesundheit-II cone
collection apparatus allowing for fractionation of particle sizes into ‘fine’ <5μm and ‘coarse’

≥5μm aerosol samples (8, 29). Each sample collection session lasted for 30 minutes. Breath
samples were concentrated, extracted, stored at -80˚C, and evaluated by qRT-PCR using
protocols and materials specified by the CDC with RNA copy number estimated as previously
described (7).

Discharge. After completion of the EE, Donors were discharged on active treatment with
oseltamivir (75mg b.i.d. 5 days), whereas Recipients were observed for 7 days, then discharged
with oseltamivir on day 8. All volunteers attended for 28-day (+/-3 days) post virus exposure
outpatient follow-up and study dismissal.

Outcome Definitions. Respiratory symptoms were defined as self-reported grade ≥1 of runny
nose, stuffy nose, sneeze, sore throat, cough, or shortness of breath ‘lasting ≥24 hours’ (SI
Appendix 2). Fever was defined as temperature >37.9 oC. Symptomatic was defined as evidence
of any respiratory symptom lasting ≥24 hours during study days 1-6. Influenza-like Illness (ILI)
was defined as an illness >24 hours duration with: either fever and at least one respiratory
symptom; or two or more symptoms of grade ≥1, one of which must have been respiratory;
eligible non-respiratory symptoms were headache, muscle/joint ache, and malaise; lasting ≥24
hours means report of a respiratory symptom during 3/3 observations within a single day, or at
least once per day over two consecutive days. Laboratory confirmed infection was defined as: a
4-fold or greater rise in HAI or MN titres between Day -2 (baseline) and Day 28; or two or more
positive NPS test results by qRT-PCR. These differed from the proof-of-concept study, which
used seroconversion or a single positive nasal wash (SI, Appendix 4).
