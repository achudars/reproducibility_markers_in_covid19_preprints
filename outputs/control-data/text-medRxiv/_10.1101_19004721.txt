Abstract
While recent advances in intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have demonstrated
the ability to restore motor and communication functions, such demonstrations have generally been
confined to controlled experimental settings and have required bulky laboratory hardware. Here,
we developed and evaluated a self-contained portable iBCI that enabled the user to interact with
various computer programs. The iBCI, which weighs 1.5 kg, consists of digital headstages, a small
signal processing hub, and a tablet PC. A human participant tested the portable iBCI in laboratory
and home settings under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (NCT01894802). The
participant successfully completed 96% of trials in a 2D cursor center-out task with the portable
iBCI, a rate indistinguishable from that achieved with the standard laboratory iBCI. The participant
also completed a variety of free-form tasks, including drawing, gaming, and typing.

Introduction
Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) are a promising technology to restore
movement and communication abilities to individuals with significant neurological injuries or
disease. Additionally, iBCI has restored movement to individuals with upper limb paralysis by
using M1 signals to control functional electrical stimulation systems [1], [2] or robotic limbs [3],
[4] with as many as 10 continuously controlled degrees-of-freedom [5]. However, all of these
demonstrations depended on experienced technicians to operate large and complicated systems
comprised of multiple computers, displays, signal processors, amplifiers, headstages, power
supplies, and cables. The size and complexity of such a system is a major barrier that must be
addressed before translating this technology into a take-home system.
The lack of a portable and convenient iBCI that is capable of functioning in many
environments has been previously identified as a barrier to translation [6]. Additionally, potential
iBCI users with upper limb paralysis have identified independent operation [7] and a simple setup
[8] as important design characteristics of a final system. Wireless and/or portable BCIs,
particularly in the non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) domain, have been developed [9]–
[13], but few have been tested outside of the laboratory. Several case studies have sent users home
with EEG [14], [15] or electrocorticographic (ECoG) [16] BCIs that could be operated on a daily
basis without experimenters or technicians present. Intracortical BCIs with external wireless
components have been demonstrated [17], [18], but still require large laboratory systems for data
acquisition and processing and hence are not fully portable. Wireless implantable iBCIs that
communicate with external processing hardware have also been developed [19], but so far have
not been tested in humans. The development of an iBCI that is sufficiently portable and simple to
set up and use is a required prerequisite to a long-term take-home study of iBCI use.
Here, we created and demonstrated a compact and portable iBCI that builds on FDAcleared technology (Blackrock NeuroPort Biopotential Signal Processing System, Blackrock
Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT) used in human clinical trials. Our system serves as a proof-ofconcept of a completely mobile system that could be used by individuals with locked-in-syndrome
or upper limb paralysis for communication, computer use and recreation, and controlling external
devices.

Methods
System components
The portable iBCI (Figure 1a) consists of digital headstages to acquire neural signals, a
tablet PC, and a signal processor hub, which provides a data interface and power isolation between
the headstages and tablet. Two Cereplex-E digital headstages (Blackrock Microsystems) were used
to acquire neural signals from up to 256 electrodes. The wearable neural signal processor hub
(wNSP hub) connects to each headstage via an HDMI cable to provide power and timing signals
to the headstages and receive data from each electrode. The wNSP hub receives power and
transmits data to the tablet PC via USB 2.0. The medical-grade tablet PC (Getac RX10H, Irvine,
CA) is IEC 60601-1 compliant and runs Windows 10. The tablet’s battery powers the entire
system. The hardware components weigh a total of 1.5 kg. All digital signal processing, decoding,
and user interaction occur on the tablet. As a result, this system is completely portable and does
not require any remote connection to other computer systems. Figure 1 compares the portable iBCI
components with our full laboratory system, which consists of a large rack of PCs and neural signal
processors, multiple displays, analog patient cable headstages, and a rack containing large
amplifiers and power supplies.

Figure 1. Components of portable and standard iBCI systems. (a) The portable iBCI consists
of a tablet PC, wNSP hub, and two Cereplex-E headstages. The headstages are connected to
two neural signal simulators in place of an iBCI user. The headstages are connected to the
wNSP hub via HDMI cables, and the wNSP hub is connected to the tablet via USB. A 12-inch
ruler is shown for reference. (b) Our standard iBCI is much larger, and consists of two neural
signal processors (NSPs), patient cable headstages, amplifiers, power supplies, and multiple
PCs and displays. Note that the photograph of our standard iBCI also includes stimulation
hardware (i.e., a stimulator and PC) not replicated in the portable iBCI.

Software overview
The tablet PC runs the Blackrock Central Suite and nPlay Server (Blackrock
Microsystems) to acquire, filter, and detect spikes from each recording channel. nPlay Server
acquires real-time neural voltage data over USB from up to 256 channels continuously sampled at
30 kHz. We configured the system via the Central Suite to filter the voltage data with a first-order
Butterworth 750 Hz high-pass filter and apply a spike detection threshold at -4.5 times the rootmean-square voltage [20], estimated during initial setup from two seconds of filtered data using
an algorithm developed by Blackrock Microsystems [21]. The system can also be configured to
perform online spike sorting, but the sorting feature was not tested in this study since our decoding
scheme uses threshold crossings on a per channel basis. Extracted spike snippets are accessible
from other applications via a software development kit (cbSDK, Blackrock Microsystems).
A modular iBCI software suite, adapted from a system described previously [3], received
and decoded spike data from nPlay Server to control a cursor, mouse emulator, or keypress
emulator. The iBCI software suite, which is summarized in Figure 2, consists of several modules
programmed in C++ and Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA). All modules communicate with each
other using the Dragonfly messaging architecture [22]. The iBCI suite acquires neural spike data
from nPlay Server via cbSDK. Spike Processing Module 1 reads spike snippets from cbSDK and
generates spike counts binned in 10 ms increments, a duration defined by a “heartbeat” packet
received from cbSDK. Spike Processing Module 2 converts the bin width to 20 ms, a duration we
defined to yield a 50 Hz system update rate, by summing pairs of spike count messages. The
Decoder Module transforms neural firing rates into velocity control signals that can drive Mouse
and Keypress Emulator Modules. This allows the iBCI user to interface with third-party Windows
applications such as painting applications, computer games, or on-screen keyboards. The Decoder
Module is also capable of displaying a center-out cursor environment and auto-generating velocity
commands during the decoder calibration procedure. The overall system configuration and task
progression is managed by the Task Executive Module.

Figure 2. Portable iBCI software. Spike data is output from nPlay Server to Spike Processing
Module 1 via cbSDK. All downstream messages were sent via the Dragonfly Messaging system,
which uses Message Manager to coordinate messages between multiple modules. All messages
are received by the Data Logger and saved for offline analysis. Some of the modules used in
the standard iBCI were consolidated into a single application on the portable iBCI (dashed red
box). All custom modules were written in C++ (blue) or Matlab (red). The “Task Executive”
is responsible for controlling the state of the system and configuring other modules. Spike data
is binned in the Spike Processing Modules and then decoded to generate a velocity command
every 20 ms, which can drive a cursor, emulated mouse, or emulated keypresses.
Human participant and implant
The portable iBCI was tested by a human participant in a study conducted under an
Investigational Device Exemption granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The study
received approval from the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh,
PA) and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (San Diego, CA) and is registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01894802). Informed consent was obtained prior to performing any
experimental procedures. The participant consented to the use of still images or videos in
publications related to this work.
A 28-year old male with a chronic C5 motor/C6 sensory ASIA B spinal cord injury was
implanted with four intracortical microelectrode arrays (Blackrock Microsystems) in primary
motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, as described previously [23]. The arrays were
wired to two pedestals in two pairs, each consisting of an 88-channel array in M1 and a 32-channel
array in S1. A total of 240 channels were recorded across the four arrays, with 176 channels in M1
used for to decode intended movement signals. The participant began using the portable iBCI
approximately three years after implant and was experienced in using the standard laboratory iBCI
system. The portable iBCI was tested both in the lab and in the participant’s home with

experimenters present to setup and supervise use of the system. All data presented in this
manuscript were collected between 1058 and 1435 days post-implant.
Signal quality comparison
The signal quality of the digital headstages and portable iBCI was compared against the
standard laboratory system by quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sorted units recorded
on three system configurations: the laboratory system with analog patient cable headstages
(standard system), the laboratory system with digital Cereplex-E headstages and digital hubs
(digital system), and the portable iBCI system (portable system). Thirty seconds of resting baseline
data were acquired in three experiment sessions for each system configuration. Spikes were
extracted offline from continuous 30 kHz voltage recordings by filtering each signal with a fourthorder Butterworth 250 Hz high-pass filter and applying a threshold at -4.5 times the root-meansquare voltage, estimated from two seconds of filtered data using the same algorithm implemented
in the Blackrock Central Suite [21]. Spikes were sorted offline using principal component analysis
and a Gaussian mixture model expectation-maximization algorithm [24]. The SNR was calculated
for each unit by dividing the mean peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) by two times the standard deviation
of the baseline noise (σnoise), as measured from the filtered signal after removing all spike snippets.
Units were sorted separately for each day and assumed to be independent. Within a day, units that
were not recorded on all three recording systems were removed from further analysis. The SNR,
Vpp, and σnoise for each unit were compared across system configurations using a one-way repeated
measures analysis-of-variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc paired t-tests were completed to evaluate
differences between recording modalities. We chose to use parametric tests even when data
distributions were skewed because ANOVA is generally considered to be robust to non-normality
and inequality of variance when sample sizes are large and balanced as is the case in our dataset
[25]. Statistical testing was performed in R. All other data processing and analysis was performed
in Matlab.
System timing
System timing and delays were evaluated by analyzing timestamps from data packets
recorded during a center-out cursor control task on the portable and standard systems. The output
of Spike Processing Module 2, which consists of binned spike counts and is expected to be sent in
regular 20 ms intervals based on the timing of “heartbeat” packets received from nPlay Server.
The difference between the packet timestamps for sequential spike count messages was considered

the system intersample period. The additional iBCI system processing and decoding delays were
evaluated by calculating the difference between the binned spike count packet timestamps and
subsequent decoded velocity command packet timestamps. This delay between the iBCI input and
output was considered the system processing delay (SPD). The intersample period and SPD were
compared between the standard system and portable iBCI tested in both the lab and at the
participant’s home using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey tests.
Decoder training and center-out task
The iBCI was tested with an optimal linear estimator decoder to control a cursor with three
degrees of freedom: 2D translation and click. A two-phase calibration procedure [3] was used in
which the participant first observed, and then performed with error-assistance, a center-out task
requiring the cursor to move from the center of the screen to one of eight targets arranged around
a circle and presented in random order. Once the cursor successfully moved to each target, a
random click target was presented by an audio cue (‘click’ or ‘unclick’). The click state of the
cursor was indicated by a green circle which expanded around the cursor when clicked, and
contracted to a point within the cursor when unclicked. During this task, click was represented as
a continuously-varying kinematic variable, rather than a binary state. Decoders were trained after
forty trials of observation, and again after forty trials of closed-loop error-assisted control, to relate
each channel’s firing rate, f, estimated by 20 ms bins of threshold crossing counts, to velocity, v,
using Equation (1). Firing rates were normalized by a square-root transform. Indirect optimal linear
estimation with ridge regression was used to determine decoding weights, b, and the resulting
decoder predicted velocity for x and y translation as well as click (c).

The decoder was first evaluated under brain-control using a 2D center-out task, which was
identical to the training task, except that no click targets were presented and control of the click
dimension was not evaluated. During each trial, the participant attempted to move the cursor to
the randomly-presented target within 5 seconds. Forty trials of this task were performed during
each session. The portable iBCI was used for three sessions at the lab and another three sessions
at the participant’s home. An additional three sessions were conducted at the lab using the standard
laboratory iBCI for comparison. For each successful trial, the time-to-target and normalized path
length were calculated. Path lengths were normalized by the ideal path length, which was the
minimum distance from the center of the circle to the edge of each target. The mean decoded

normalized speed was calculated for all trials, including failed trials. Since the portable and
laboratory systems have different monitor sizes and thus visually different target spacing, decoded
speeds were normalized by the target distance (d). With this approach a constant normalized speed
of 1 d/s along the ideal path would result in a time-to-target of 1 second. The decoded speed was
equal to actual speed only if the intersample period was exactly 20 ms. Hence, the actual time-totarget was affected by three parameters: decoded speed, path length, and intersample period. The
time-to-target, normalized path length, and normalized mean decoded speed metrics were
compared across the three systems (standard laboratory iBCI, portable iBCI, and portable iBCI in
the participant’s home) using one-way ANOVA tests with post-hoc Tukey tests.
Functional evaluation
The 2D translation and click decoder trained on the portable iBCI was used to control
mouse and keyboard emulators, which allowed the participant to perform freeform functional tasks
of his choosing, including painting, typing with an on-screen keyboard, or computer games. The
mouse emulator converted the decoded velocity commands to the position and click states of the
Windows 10 system mouse cursor. The continuously-decoded click position, bounded between 0
and 1, was discretized into a clicked (position > 0.5) or unclicked (position < 0.5) state. The
emulated mouse was used to control a painting application (TuxPaint) or to type using an on-screen
keyboard. The keyboard emulator was used to control computer games by mapping positive and
negative velocity commands for each degree of freedom to different emulated keypresses. A
velocity threshold was applied to each direction (+x, -x, +y, -y, +c, -c) to trigger a unique keypress
(e.g. arrow keys and spacebar) when the velocity crossed the threshold. The emulated keypresses
were used as input to a variety of computer games of the participant’s choosing. Performance was
not evaluated quantitatively, but sample performance was captured in the form of completed
paintings and video capture of iBCI use.
Results
Signal quality
The SNR, peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp), and baseline noise (σnoise) for each recording setup
are quantified in Table 1. We found that recording setup had significant effects on both Vpp (F(2,
2704) = 236.4, p < 0.001) and σnoise (F(2, 1438) = 58.16, p < 0.001), with significant differences
between all system pairs (all p < 0.001). The changes in Vpp and σnoise both resulted in a change in

SNR. The baseline noise decreased with the digital headstages, and was lowest with the portable
system, which had a 20% decrease in σnoise compared to the standard system. However, the peakto-peak voltage also decreased with the digital headstages such that the portable system had an
11% decrease in Vpp compared to the standard system. Overall, these changes yielded a 5%
increase in SNR for the portable iBCI as compared to the standard system (F(2, 2704) = 128.4,
p < 0.001; all post-hoc p < 0.001). As shown in Figure 3, the digital headstages systematically
increased the SNR of sorted units for both the portable and laboratory systems.

System timing
When examining system latency, we found that the portable iBCI had increased variability
in the timing of incoming spike data packets. An example of this intersample timing variability is
shown in Figure 4. These delays are quantified across three testing days in Table 2.

Figure 4. Intersample periods. Both the standard (blue) and portable (orange) iBCI systems
are expected to output a binned spike count packet every 20 ms. Both systems exhibit a mean
intersample period of approximately 20 ms in the representative timecourse of system timing,
but the portable iBCI exhibits more variability with symmetric spikes at 10 and 30 ms indicating
that packets are occasionally delayed, but not dropped.

The intersample periods between spike data packets were significantly different between
recording systems (F(2, 98912) = 1586, p < 0.001), with post-hoc tests revealing less delay in the
standard system as compared to the portable system at either the lab or home (both p < 0.001).
Most of the difference between the three groups can be explained by the increased variance of the
portable iBCI. While the mean intersample period was greatest during laboratory testing with the

portable iBCI, most of this increased delay occurred during only one of the three test sessions. The
mean intersample periods for each individual session were 25.7 ± 12.0 ms, 20.9 ± 7.3 ms and 20.0
± 3.9 ms, respectively. The system processing delay (SPD) between spike count packets and
subsequent decoded velocity commands was also significantly different across the three system
conditions (F(2, 97357) = 7469, p < 0.001, all pairwise comparisons p < 0.001), with the standard
system having the highest SPD and the portable system having the lowest SPD during in-home
testing.
Center-out task performance
The participant had considerable experience with the 2D center-out task prior to these
sessions and in these experiments, success rates were generally unaffected by the type of system
or testing location. The participant successfully completed 115/120 (95.8%) trials with the
standard lab iBCI, 117/120 (97.5%) trials with the portable iBCI at the lab, and 114/120 (95.0%)
trials with the portable iBCI at the participant’s home. Trajectories for all trials are shown in Figure
5. Sample performance can be seen in Supplementary Video 1.

target. Individual colored lines show trajectories from individual trials to targets with matching
colors.
The mean and standard deviation values of time-to-target and normalized path length for
successful trials and normalized mean decoded speed of all trials are summarized in Table 3. The
time-to-target was significantly faster on the standard laboratory iBCI than the portable iBCI tested
at the laboratory or the participant’s home (F(2, 343) = 12.3, p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA; post

path lengths achieved with the three recording conditions (F(2, 343) = 0.363, p = 0.696).
Normalized mean decoded cursor speed was significantly faster on the standard iBCI, as compared
to the portable iBCI at the lab or the participant’s home (F(2,357) = 27.05, p < 0.001; post-hoc p

Functional evaluation
The participant was able to use the portable iBCI both in the lab and at his home for a
variety of uses including computer painting, playing games, and typing. Examples of these tasks
are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows the participant using the system mounted to his wheelchair,
while in Figure 6b it is positioned in his lap. Sample performance during iBCI painting and gaming
can be seen in Supplementary Videos 2-3. The participant was also able to participate in a multiplayer computer game with able-bodied competitors by connecting conventional USB gamepad
controllers to the tablet using a USB hub.
The decoder calibration procedure alternated click and release targets across trials,
resembling a click-and-drag behavior. This was well-suited for the painting task, but made it
relatively difficult to click on buttons, such as to select different paint brushes and colors or during
the typing task. Despite this difficulty, the participant was able to type the phrase “howdy world
:)” using an on-screen keyboard, as seen in Figure 6c and successfully painted with a variety of
colors, as seen in Figure 6d.

Discussion
We demonstrated the feasibility of a portable iBCI that can fit on a user’s power wheelchair
and be used for a variety of computer tasks such as typing, painting, and gaming. The system
builds on FDA-cleared technology and includes only three major hardware components that are
relatively lightweight and simple to setup: digital headstages, a signal processing hub, and a tablet
PC. The small form factor and simplicity of the hardware could potentially pave the way for
independent home iBCI use, or even mobile use of an iBCI in public settings.
The digital headstages used in the portable iBCI provided a small, yet statistically
significant, increase in mean signal-to-noise ratio as compared to the analog patient cables and
amplifiers traditionally used in laboratory iBCI systems. This increase in SNR can likely be

explained by the observed decrease in baseline noise due to the fact that the digital headstages
place the amplifier and digitizer at a much shorter distance to the electrodes, directly on top of the
percutaneous electrode connectors, and without requiring cables between the percutaneous
connector and amplifier. We unexpectedly found that the mean peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) was
also reduced when using the digital headstages. This result can possibly be explained by the fact
that the spike detection thresholds, which are calculated based on the signal VRMS, were lowered
due to the reduced noise level, allowing signals with a smaller Vpp to be detected as spikes.
The participant in this study was able to complete a 2D cursor center-out task on the
portable iBCI with a very high success rate indistinguishable from the success rate accomplished
using the standard lab iBCI. Path lengths to each target were generally efficient and were also
indistinguishable from those performed on the standard iBCI. However, trial completion times
were significantly slower when using the portable iBCI. Several reasons may have contributed to
this discrepancy in performance.
First, the portable iBCI system timing was more variable than the standard iBCI. The
system was expected to output binned spike count data every 20 ms, but these data packets were
sometimes delayed by 10 ms or more, an irregularity generally not seen on the standard iBCI.
Despite this intersample period irregularity, the additional system processing and decoding delays
within the iBCI software suite were actually more efficient on the portable iBCI, possibly due to
the elimination of network transmission delays by consolidating the system onto a single computer.
It is unclear if these timing irregularities affected the participant’s control strategy or introduced
any feedback delays.
Second, in addition to the timing irregularities, the mean decoded speed was slightly slower
when using the portable iBCI. One possible explanation for this reduction in decoded speed is the
fact that the portable iBCI utilizes a tablet screen that is much smaller than the television display
used with the standard system. Decoded velocity units were based on a fixed cursor coordinate
system that visually scaled based on display size. However, the participant observed the cursor
move in a physically smaller workspace on the portable iBCI and may have imagined slower
velocities as a result. However, these slower velocities did not impede the participant’s ability to
successfully complete trials and he was able to demonstrate a variety of functional tasks with the
portable iBCI, both in the lab and at the home, including drawing, gaming, and typing.

There are several limitations of the portable iBCI that could be improved or eliminated in
future iterations of the system. First, while we were able to test the iBCI both in the lab and in the
participant’s home, as per our trial protocol, all tests required an experimenter to be present to set
up, configure, and monitor the system. The software interface is adapted from the standard system,
which was designed for the flexibility necessary to run a wide variety of experiments. This resulted
in a complicated interface intended to be run by an experimenter with many unnecessary features
for an end-user. Further iterations of the iBCI software suite are required to shift to a user-centric
design and allow for independent use of the system by iBCI users and caregivers.
Second, we found that the neural data was received by the iBCI software suite with
irregular timing that exhibited more variability than the standard iBCI. The standard iBCI includes
dedicated neural signal processors (NSPs) that run a real-time operating system. The NSPs receive
continuously sampled neural data from the amplifiers through a fiber optic connection and output
extracted spike snippets in real-time to a networked PC over ethernet. Additionally, the standard
iBCI software suite is distributed across several high-performance PCs. This is contrasted with the
portable iBCI, in which all neural signal processing and iBCI software runs on the Windows 10
tablet PC. Continuously-sampled neural data is transmitted to the tablet from the wNSP hub over
USB 2.0. The USB 2.0 specification defines a maximum signaling rate of 480 Mb/s [26]. The
portable system streams 16-bit neural data sampled at 30 kHz from up to 256 electrode channels
to the tablet over USB, which requires a minimum bandwidth of 123 Mb/s, or 26% of the
maximum signaling rate permitted by USB 2.0. While this is theoretically enough bandwidth, a
faster protocol such as USB 3.x or gigabit ethernet would enable expansion to higher channels
counts.
Additionally, the tablet PC has limited resources to receive and process the neural data, run
the iBCI software suite to decode neural spikes and generate velocity commands, and run external
programs that the user wishes to control. Running these tasks on relatively low-performance tablet
hardware may result in poor performance, manifested by irregular timing and poor battery life.
Additional processing power may be needed to study higher degree-of-freedom control or to
interface with external devices. There are several potential options that may improve performance.
The most straightforward option is to use a more powerful tablet PC. The tablet in this study was
chosen primarily because it had already undergone IEC 60601-1 testing and is considered medicalgrade. The wNSP hub is designed to electrically isolate the tablet from the digital headstages, and

thus the requirement for an IEC 606061-1 compliant tablet can potentially be relaxed though this
would need to be confirmed through electrical safety testing of a complete system. A tablet with a
faster processor would likely improve performance. Additionally, while it would not be desirable
to add additional components to the system, it may be possible to offload some of the neural signal
processing and decoding to a small secondary microcontroller networked with the tablet PC. This
would free up resources on the tablet PC for applications that the user directly interacts with.
Finally, in a home environment, it may be preferable for the iBCI to network with the user’s
personal computer. In this scenario, the tablet PC would perform neural signal processing and
decoding, but would send commands such as emulated mouse movements and clicks to an external
computer running the user’s choice of software.
The functional demonstrations presented here suggest that an iBCI user could use the
portable iBCI for a variety of independent tasks, including communication tasks, creative tasks
such as drawing, and recreational tasks such as gaming and web browsing. It is worth noting that
the focus of this study was in the development and evaluation of portable iBCI hardware rather
than algorithm development for optimal computer access. Therefore, this work is complementary
to that of other research groups that have demonstrated high levels of performance for computer
cursor control and communication (e.g. [1], [2]) including integration of laboratory hardware
systems with commercially available tablets through wireless communication [19]. In future work,
we would like to investigate the portable iBCI in a take-home study to evaluate independent use
of the system by the iBCI user outside of a controlled setting, which may include use at home or
mobile use in public settings.
