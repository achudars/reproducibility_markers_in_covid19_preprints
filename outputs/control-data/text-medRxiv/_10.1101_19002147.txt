Abstract
Objective: Cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) places a high burden on patients
and the pathophysiological mechanisms that differentiate patients with cognitive impairment
from those without it are still incompletely understood.
Methods: We conducted a resting-state seed region-of-interest approach to investigate
functional connectivity (FC) of important subdivisions of the caudate nucleus, putamen and
thalamus in controls (n=33), cognitively unimpaired subjects (PD-CU, n=33), PD subjects
with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n=22) and subjects with dementia (PDD, n=17).
We then investigated how the morphology of these structures differed between groups.
Results: PD-CU subjects, compared to controls, displayed increased and decreased FC of
caudate, putamen and thalamic subdivisions. PD-MCI subjects demonstrated reduced FC of
the mediodorsal thalamus with the paracingulate cortex, compared to PD-CU, and reduced
FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with the posterior cingulate cortex compared to PDD.
Extensive volumetric and surface-based deflation was found in subjects with dementia.
Conclusions: Our research suggests that cognitive impairment and dementia in PD may be
associated with a breakdown in FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with para- and posterior
cingulate regions of the brain, respectively.
Significance: Cognitive impairment and dementia in PD may relate to pathophysiological
changes in FC of the mediodorsal thalamus.

1. Introduction
Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world,
affecting 2-3% of the population over the age of 65 (Poewe et al., 2017). Traditionally
categorized as a disorder of movement, it is now widely recognised that patients experience
significant neuropsychiatric symptoms relating to executive, memory, attentional and visual
disturbances (Litvan et al., 2012). Recent recognition of the high prevalence and substantial
impact of cognitive impairment in PD has drawn research attention to PD-related mild
cognitive impairment (MCI)1 (Goldman et al., 2018) which is associated with a significantly
higher likelihood of developing dementia (Broeders et al., 2013).

The pathophysiological mechanisms that distinguish PD patients with cognitive impairment
from those without it are poorly understood (Williams-Gray et al., 2007). The pathological
hallmark of the disorder is the presence of α-synuclein-immunopositive Lewy bodies and
neurites (Obeso et al., 2000) which results in a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra pars compacta, and subsequent depletion of dopamine at the striatum (caudate nucleus
and putamen) (Kish et al., 1988). While nigrostriatal dopamine loss is a core feature of PD,
evidence suggests that pathology within the thalamus also contributes to the abnormal neural
activity associated with the disorder (Halliday, 2009). The combined neural activity in these
nodes within basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in PD results in brain network
abnormalities being as key components to PD pathophysiology (Strafella, 2013).

To understand the functioning of brain networks it is necessary to study both the constituent
neuronal elements of networks, as well as their interconnections (Sporns et al., 2005).
Investigating neuronal elements can be done by quantifying disease-related effects on the
morphology of ‘hubs’ (Looi et al., 2014) while interconnections can be investigated via
resting-state functional connectivity (FC) analyses (Damoiseaux et al., 2006). Due to the
importance of the caudate nucleus, putamen and the thalamus to the abnormal neural activity
associated with PD, coupled with the fact that these structures are considered important hubs
in brain networks (Hwang et al., 2017, Looi and Walterfang, 2013), an analysis of the
morphology and FC of these structures may yield neuroimaging biomarkers of brain network
abnormalities in PD that relate to cognitive dysfunction.

There is a significant variability in the field of neuroimaging biomarkers in PD, with reviews
of structural and functional studies revealing few clear patterns (Khan et al., 2018). Research
has yielded important information about the functioning of widescale intrinsic FC networks is
impacted in PD relative to cognitive status, however the specific role played by important
hubs within basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry is yet to be fully elucidated. Studies have
found cognitively unimpaired PD is associated with both increases (Gorges et al., 2015) and
decreases (Bell et al., 2015) in FC of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, while PD
subjects with MCI have been shown to generally display decreases in FC (Amboni et al.,
2015, Gorges et al., 2015). Data on the morphological changes to the caudate, putamen and
thalamus in PD subjects without dementia is also varied. Research groups have demonstrated
both the presence (Garg et al., 2015, Mckeown et al., 2008) and absence (Menke et al., 2014,
Messina et al., 2011) of morphological changes to the thalamus, while others have shown
either the presence (Pitcher et al., 2012, Sterling et al., 2013) or absence (Menke et al., 2014,
Owens-Walton et al., 2018) of morphological changes to the caudate or putamen. Studies

suggest that PD with dementia is associated with atrophic changes to the caudate nucleus,
putamen and thalamus (Summerfield et al., 2005, Owens-Walton et al., 2018), however the
presence and extent of such changes in PD-MCI is uncertain (Chen et al., 2016, Melzer et al.,
2012). Using a well-defined clinical cohort, and a targeted resting-state fMRI FC approach,
the current study aims to better understand how FC and morphology of the caudate nucleus,
putamen and thalamus are impacted in PD, and how these factors may vary between
cognitively unimpaired PD patients, PD-MCI and PD patients with dementia.

2. Methods
2.1 Participants
Participants in this study were from the Swedish BioFINDER study (www.biofinder.se) and
gave informed written consent. All elements of the research were performed in accordance
with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was
obtained through the Ethical Review Board of Lund, Sweden, and the Human Research
Ethics Committee at the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

2.2 PD disease groups: cognitive impairment
Diagnosis of PD was made by a neurologist using the National Institute of Neurological and
Stroke Diagnostic Criteria (Gelb et al., 1999). The total PD cohort was subdivided into three
cognitive impairment disease groups. The first group was made up of cognitively unimpaired
PD patients (PD-CU; n = 33) while the second group was made up of PD patients with mild
cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 22), based on the Movement Disorder Society Task
force guidelines (Litvan et al., 2012). The MCI criterion is met when patients score at least 1
standard deviation below the normative mean in at least two cognitive tests, including
executive function, attention, visuospatial, memory and language domains. The third

subgroup consists of PD participants with dementia (PDD; n = 17) diagnosed using the
Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Dementia Associated with PD (Emre et al., 2007). A healthy
control group (Controls) was included for comparative purposes (n = 26). Exclusion criteria
for this study included refusing MRI, the presence of significant alcohol or substance misuse
and/or a significant unstably systematic illness or organ failure. All participants underwent a
cognitive and neurological examination by a medical doctor with extensive experience with
movement disorders, while PD patients remained on their usual medication regimes. Clinical
functioning of participants in the current study is demonstrated by performance on the Hoehn
and Yahr, assessing the progression of the disorder, the ‘Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale Part-III’ test (UPDRS-III), assessing the motor signs of PD (Fahn and Elton, 1987), and
the ‘Mini Mental State Examination’ (MMSE), assessing cognitive mental state (Folstein et
al., 1975).

2.3 MRI acquisition
Structural MRI data was obtained on a 3T scanner (Trio, Siemens Magnetom, Erlangen,
Germany) with a 20-channel head-coil. High resolution T1-weighted three-dimensional
anatomical brain images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition
technique with gradient-echo sequence (repetition time = 7 ms; echo time = 3 ms; flip angle =
90 degrees; voxel size = isotropic 1mm3). Image matrix size was 356 voxels in the coronal
and sagittal planes and 176 voxels in the axial plane. Functional MRI data consists of 256
T2*-weighted echo planar imaging volumes (repetition time = 1850 ms; echo time 30 ms;
flip angle = 90 degrees; voxel size 3 × 3 × 3.75 mm3) for each participant. Matrix size was 64
voxels in the coronal and sagittal planes and 36 voxels in the axial plane. Subjects were
instructed to lie still with their eyes closed, not to fall asleep and not to think of anything in
particular during the scan, which lasted for approximately 8 minutes.

2.4 Preprocessing of T1 anatomical MRI data
Preprocessing of T1-weighted structural data was performed using the FSL software package
(FSL, Oxford, UK; version 5.0.10) (Jenkinson et al., 2012). Images underwent brain
extraction using the FSL-BET tool (Smith, 2002) which were then processed using FSLFAST, segmenting the T1-image into brain tissue types whilst correcting for image intensity
fluctuations caused by inhomogeneities in the radio frequency field (Zhang et al., 2001).

2.5 Preprocessing of resting-state fMRI data
Preprocessing of resting-state functional images was performed using FSL-FEAT (v6.0).
Steps included deletion of first 6 volumes, motion correction using FSL-MCFLIRT
(Jenkinson et al., 2002) and removal of non-brain tissue using FSL-BET (Smith, 2002).
Registration of functional images to subject-specific high resolution T1-weighted structural
images using a boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl, 2009) within FSL-FLIRT
linear registration tool (Jenkinson et al., 2002, Jenkinson and Smith, 2001). Registration of
functional images to MNI 152 T1 2mm3 standard space was performed with FSL-FLIRT with
12 degrees of freedom, further refined using FSL-FNIRT nonlinear registration (Andersson et
al., 2007a, Andersson et al., 2007b) with a warp resolution of 10mm and a resampling
resolution of 4mm. Data denoising was then performed with FSL-MELODIC (v3.15)
independent component analysis (Beckmann and Smith, 2004) to identify any potential
influence of head motion, scanner and cerebrospinal fluid artefacts. FSL-FIX (v1.06) (SalimiKhorshidi et al., 2014) was then used to remove components classified as ‘noise’ and also
correct for motion confounds. Spatial smoothing was then performed (FWHM Gaussian
kernel = 5mm) followed by a multiplicative mean intensity normalization and a high-pass
temporal filtering Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting with sigma = 50.0s

denoising.’

2.6 Resting-state fMRI: Seed-based region-of-interest approach
To investigate the role of the caudate, putamen and thalamus in PD groups with varying
levels of cognitive impairment, we used an atlas-based method to subdivide the structures
into functionally relevant regions-of-interest (ROI). We performed this step using the Oxford
Thalamic Connectivity Atlas (Behrens et al., 2003) and the Oxford-GSK-Imanova
Connectivity Atlas (Tziortzi et al., 2014) within FSLEyes. Regions of the dorsal and central
caudate nucleus (Figure 1) and the anterior putamen have the highest probability of
connectivity with the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices in the brain (BA9, 9/46 and
10) and are said to be involved in cognitive processes, including perception, memory,
reasoning and judgement (Haber, 2003). The mediodorsal and anterior thalamic nuclei have
the highest probability of connectivity to the dorsolateral and prefrontal cortices (Behrens et
al., 2003) and these thalamic nuclear regions are said to be involved in limbic, episodic
memory and cognitive functions (Power and Looi, 2015). For ease of reference, we will refer
to these three seed-ROIs as the ‘dorsal caudate’, ‘anterior putamen’ and ‘mediodorsal
thalamus’ respectively. These three bilateral standard space MNI 152 2mm3 seed-ROI masks
were thresholded to only include voxels that had a greater than 50% likelihood of inclusion
within the mask (Figure 1A). Masks were then registered to subject-specific structural T1
space where we used them to ‘cookie-cut’ ROIs from the FSL-FIRST segmentation masks.
This was done by overlaying the seed mask over the FSL-FIRST segmentation mask, with
the seed-ROI being the neuroanatomical area covered by both masks. The created seed-ROIs
were then converted to subject-specific functional MRI space where we performed a final

erosion to avoid partial volume effects (Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds, 2017). Mean
activation data from within the three seed-ROIs at each timepoint was used as explanatory
variables for subsequent statistical analyses. Before investigating the differences in FC
between groups we conducted three one-sample t-tests on all of the Control subjects to look
at the FC of our seed-ROIs with the rest of the brain. This step indicates the areas of highest
FC with our seed-ROIs and provides a backdrop on which to interpret our results (Figure
1B).

2.7 Resting-state fMRI: Statistical analyses
Three individual-level FC analyses were performed for each participant using a general linear
model (GLM) in a mass univariate voxelwise whole-brain analysis (Woolrich et al., 2004).
This GLM approach measures the correlation between activity within each of the three seedROIs and the rest of the brain. We used a FILM pre-whitening correction (Woolrich et al.,
2001) and shifted the model with a temporal derivative to account for slice timing effects and
variations in the hemodynamic response function. As there were significant differences in
UPDRS-III motor scores, we performed extra processing steps to minimise possible
confounding effects of head motion, as well as regressing out signals from within white
matter, ventricle and whole-brain masks. For a full explanation these steps, please see ‘1.
Supplementary Information Materials and Methods: 1.2 Individual-level GLM functional
connectivity analyses.’ Group-level analyses were performed using FSL-FLAME in a mixedeffects design (Woolrich et al., 2004). Age and gender data were included as covariates.
When investigating FC between the PD-CU, PD-MCI and PDD groups we also included
levodopa-equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) data as a covariate. Z-statistic (Gaussianized)
images from participants individual-level GLM statistical maps were thresholded nonparametrically using clusters determined by Z > 3.1 and a (corrected) cluster significance of p
< 0.05 (Worsley, 2001).

2.8 Volumetrics: Statistical analyses
Volumes of the caudate, putamen and thalamus were estimated using the segmentation and
registration tool FSL-FIRST (Patenaude et al., 2011). This uses a model-based approach to
segment subcortical structures producing output meshes and volumetric data. Investigating
differences between experimental groups was performed with SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation,
Somers, New York, USA) utilising two-tailed multivariate analysis of covariance models

controlling for intracranial volume (derived from FSL-FAST) and age. Multivariate partial
eta squared values (η2) are used to report effect sizes (Cohen, 1992).

2.9 SPHARM-PDM surface shape: Statistical analyses
Volumetric analyses can investigate overall atrophic differences between groups, however
they cannot highlight where this atrophy takes place. Accordingly, we used spherical
harmonic parametrization three-dimensional point distribution model (SPHARM-PDM) to
investigate localized surface changes to the segmentations of the caudate, putamen and
thalamus between experimental groups (Styner et al., 2006). This method produces mean
displacement maps which show the magnitude of surface displacement (deflation or inflation
in mm) between corresponding points on the mean surface of one experimental group
compared to another. Segmentations were preprocessed to ensure a spherical topology, then
described by spherical harmonic functions and sampled onto surfaces of 1002 points.
Surfaces were then aligned using a rigid-body Procrustes alignment to a mean template
created from a group sample. Comparisons between groups were performed using
multivariate analysis of covariance models with a Hotelling statistic in R (version 3.2.1, R
Development Core Team, 2014). All analyses included covariates of estimated total
intracranial volume, age and sex. Significant surface changes are indicated by regions with a
p value < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons with a false-discovery rate (FDR) bound q
of 5% (Genovese et al., 2002). Results are presented as a composite map of each structure
with displacement only displayed in regions that are FDR significant.

include local maxima at the left postcentral gyrus (BA3), left precentral gyrus (BA6), left
superior frontal gyrus (BA6), left paracingulate gyrus (BA32), right frontal pole (BA10), left
anterior cingulate (BA24) and the left middle frontal gyrus (BA8) (Figure 2A; Supplementary
Information Table 1). We found clusters of decreased FC at the right lateral occipital cortex
(BA19), left cerebellar crus I, left angular gyrus (BA39) and left cerebellar lobule VI (Figure
2A; Table 2). These clusters extended to include local maxima at the left supramarginal gyrus
(BA39) and left cerebellar vermis VI (Figure 2A; Supplementary Information Table 1).

Anterior putamen: Analysis of the anterior putamen in PD-CU compared to Controls found
clusters of increased FC at the bilateral middle frontal gyri (BA8, 9), left frontal pole (BA10),
bilateral postcentral gyri (BA2, 3), left paracingulate gyrus (BA32) and right inferior frontal
gyrus (BA44) (Figure 2B; Table 2). These clusters extended to include local maxima at the
bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (BA24), right frontal pole (BA10), left superior frontal
gyrus (BA9), bilateral precentral gyri (BA4, 6) and bilateral central operculum (BA42)
(Figure 2B; Supplementary Information Table 2). We also found clusters of decreased FC at
the left lateral occipital cortex (BA7) and right precuneus (BA7) (Figure 2B; Table 2). These
clusters extended to include a local maxima at the left precuneus (Figure 2B; Supplementary
Information Table 2).

4. Discussion
This study investigates caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus functional connectivity (FC)
and morphology alterations associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in PD. Our
study contributes new knowledge by showing how important functional subdivisions of these
structures are impacted across cognitive disease stages.

Our findings of increased FC between the dorsal caudate, anterior putamen and mediodorsal
thalamus with the pre- and postcentral gyri support a recent meta-analysis indicating that PD
is associated with increased FC of these cortical regions (Ji et al., 2018). After weighing the
relative contributions of seed-ROIs, this meta-analysis demonstrated that seeds placed within
the caudate, putamen and thalamus contributed most to this result. Our findings also support
work demonstrating increases in FC between a basal ganglia-thalamic network and areas of
the prefrontal cortex and anterior/paracingulate gyri (Gorges et al., 2015). This study argues
that such hyper-connectivity in cognitively unimpaired PD subjects may be representative of
the recruitment of additional resources in the brain to maintain cognitive performance
(Gorges et al., 2015). A common response to neurological disruption is hyper-connectivity of
brain circuits, and it is suggested that such a response may reflect compensatory mechanisms
in the brain to maintain normal levels of neuronal functioning (Hillary et al., 2015). Our
results provide some support for this hypothesis and may signal how resources can be
recruited to maintain ‘normal’ cognitive functioning. These increases in FC between the
dorsal caudate and regions across the prefrontal cortex and anterior/paracingulate gyri may
relate to changes within the executive control network (ECN). This network is comprised of
dorsal and ventrolateral prefrontal, frontoinsular, lateral parietal, middle prefrontal cortices,
anterior and paracingulate gyri, as well as subcortical sites at the mediodorsal and anterior
thalamic nuclei and the dorsal caudate (Beckmann et al., 2005, Seeley et al., 2007). The ECN
has been validated on a large scale and has shown that activity within this network

corresponds strongly with several paradigms of cognition in task-based FC analyses (Smith et
al., 2009).

Our data also indicate that PD-CU is associated with a reduction in FC between the dorsal
caudate and the cerebellum. This result supports previous work demonstrated decreases in FC
between the caudate nucleus and an ‘extended brainstem’ region encompassing the
cerebellum (Hacker et al., 2012) . These findings are significant because loss of FC between
the caudate and the cerebellum may serve as a viable candidate for PD related gait
difficulties, postural instability and freezing, which can be linked to dysfunction in cerebellar
circuitry (Hacker et al., 2012). Our data also indicate that PD-CU subjects have decreased FC
between the dorsal caudate/anterior putamen and the precuneus and angular gyrus. This
finding supports the work demonstrating decreases in FC between nodes in the DMN,
including lateral and medial parietal regions (Amboni et al., 2015).

While our results support a number of previous research findings, they contrast with similar
work, necessitating explication. One group has demonstrated no significant differences in FC
of the anterior striatum in a PD cohort (when placed on medication) compared to Control
subjects (Bell et al., 2015), while also finding no differences in FC of seed-ROIs placed in the
thalamus and brain regions within intrinsic connectivity networks. Similarly, our data
contrast with work showing decreased FC between the caudate and putamen and brain
regions across the frontal lobe, as well as hypo-connectivity of the thalamus with insular
cortices (Agosta et al., 2014). There are a number of methodological considerations that may
explain these discrepancies. The former work involved a younger PD cohort to the current
study, which brings into question the impact of age related changes in FC (Fair et al., 2008),
while the latter work focussed on a PD cohort with unilateral disease presentation, studying

FC of the ‘more affected’ and ‘less affected’ hemispheres (Agosta et al., 2014). This
approach increases the specificity of their analysis, however it makes comparisons with the
present data difficult as we averaged FC signals from seeds within both hemispheres at each
timepoint.

PD-MCI subjects showed decreased FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with the paracingulate
gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and frontal pole compared to cognitively unimpaired PD subjects.
Our findings of decreased FC of the mediodorsal thalamus support previous work indicating
that PD-MCI is associated with lower FC between a basal ganglia-thalamic intrinsic
connectivity network and the anterior/paracingulate gyri compared to a cognitively
unimpaired PD cohort (Gorges et al., 2015). Decreased FC between the mediodorsal
thalamus and medial prefrontal brain regions provides evidence for the important link
between midline nodes within the ECN and cognitive function. As outlined, structures within
this network are related to cognitive function (Beckmann et al., 2005, Seeley et al., 2007), as
they work together to provide bias signals to other areas of the brain to implement and
maintain cognitive control processes (Miller and Cohen, 2001). While we have demonstrated
increased FC of nodes within this network in PD-CU subjects, here we demonstrate that PDMCI subjects have a reduced FC between the mediodorsal thalamus and paracingulate
cortices. While traditionally thought to be subserve affective functions, the cingulate has
emerged as an important structure associated with higher cognitive processes, and has been
shown to be particularly vulnerable to disease processes where executive control is impaired
(Carter et al., 2000). Stronger FC between nodes of the ECN has been shown to be positively
correlated with superior executive task performance of subjects (Seeley et al., 2007). If the
corollary holds true, poorer cognitive performance, as our PD-MCI subjects demonstrate,
might be associated with reduced FC within this network, which we have demonstrated.

PDD subjects showed decreased FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with the posterior posterior
cingulate cortex (PCC) compared to PD-MCI subjects, supporting the findings from graph
theoretical research (Zhan et al., 2018). Decreases in FC between these regions is significant
due to the crucial role played by the PCC in cognitive functioning as well as the role of the
mediodorsal thalamus and PCC within the default-mode network (DMN). The functional role
played by the PCC involves elements of memory consolidation, attention and the control
required to balance internally and externally focussed thoughts (Leech and Sharp, 2014). The
PCC is affected in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (Buckner et al., 2009,
Greicius et al., 2004, Mevel et al., 2011) and atrophy of the PCC has been demonstrated in
PD subjects with dementia (Melzer et al., 2012). The PCC has important structural and also
functional connectivity with the thalamus (Cunningham et al., 2017) and it has been
suggested that the structure may play an important role balancing the interaction between
brain regions in the prefrontal cortex that are involved cognitive processes and posterior
nodes within the DMN (Greicius et al., 2003). These researchers suggested that the thalamus
is uniquely positioned to act as an intermediary structure in the brain that balances the
interaction between these regions due to its extensive cortico-cortical connectivity (Greicius
et al., 2003). Our research supports this idea, highlighting how the FC between the
mediodorsal thalamus and the PCC is impacted in PD subjects with dementia.

Our research found no evidence of morphological alterations to the caudate, putamen or
thalamus in PD-CU subjects compared to Controls, supporting previous studies (Lee et al.,
2014, Mak et al., 2014, Mckeown et al., 2008, Menke et al., 2014, Messina et al., 2011,
Nemmi et al., 2015, Tinaz et al., 2011). We also found no evidence of volume loss to the
caudate, putamen or thalamus in PD-MCI compared to Controls, supporting a previous study

(Amboni et al., 2015). Volumetric changes in PDD were found in all three structures,
supporting previous work (Burton et al., 2004, Melzer et al., 2012, Summerfield et al., 2005).
Shape analysis demonstrated widespread surface deflation in PDD compared to PD-CU
subjects, fine-tuning these volumetric results. Regarding the caudate, surface deflation was
found primarily at the rostral and dorsomedial surfaces, areas with putative connectivity to
the executive regions of the frontal lobe as well as the rostral motor regions (Tziortzi et al.,
2014). These regions of the caudate are also known to demonstrate dopaminergic depletion
(Kish et al., 1988). Surface deflation was found at the anterior, dorsal and posterior putamen
surface regions areas with putative connectivity to the executive regions of the frontal lobe as
well as caudal motor regions (Tziortzi et al., 2014). Widespread surface deflation was found
primarily across the medial surface of the bilateral thalami, corresponding to surface regions
of the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei with connections to the dorsolateral and
prefrontal cortices (Behrens et al., 2003). Supporting this finding, this region of the thalamus
displays significant cell loss in PD patients post-mortem (Halliday, 2009). Our findings
support a previous study that found no significant difference between PD-MCI and
cognitively unimpaired PD subjects using a vertex-wise shape analysis method (Mak et al.,
2014). Our morphological data on PD-CU subjects are also consistent with previous studies
which indicate that PD is not associated with localized surface alterations (Lee et al., 2014,
Menke et al., 2014, Messina et al., 2011) however they contrast with the results of two groups
who found localised surface deflation in PD (Garg et al., 2015, Mckeown et al., 2008). As
raised previously, methodological inconsistencies between studies may be a significant factor
behind these differences.

This research was performed in a cross-sectional manner, logically assuming a sequential
temporal relationship between PD-CU, PD-MCI and PDD groupings. Categorisation of PD

subjects in this way is a potential limitation, as we cannot be sure that all participants with
PD-CU will progress to PD-MCI, then to PDD. While there is strong evidence that PD-MCI
does represent an intermediate cognitive disease stage between cognitively unimpaired PD
and PDD (Litvan et al., 2012), future research should follow a longitudinal design to better
study how functional connectivity and morphology of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits
are related to cognitive impairment in PD. This would have the added benefit of reducing the
influence of the significant disease heterogeneity in PD which has been shown to have a
significant impact on the reproducibility of results in this field of research (Badea et al.,
2017).

This study demonstrated how the functional connectivity of subcortical hubs within basal
ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are implicated in PD between cognitive disease stages.
Functional connectivity changes are found in cognitively unimpaired PD subjects, who
display no morphological changes, while PD-MCI subjects and PDD subjects both display
decreases in functional connectivity of the mediodorsal thalamus with the anterior and
posterior cingulate cortices respectively. Our research highlights the importance of the
caudate, putamen and thalamus as core structures within key intrinsic connectivity networks
in the brain, and indicates that a breakdown in functional connectivity of the mediodorsal
thalamus is tied to mild cognitive impairment and dementia in PD.
