Abstract
Aims: Loneliness and social isolation are associated with cigarette smoking and problematic alcohol
use. Observational evidence suggests these associations arise because loneliness increases substance
use, however there is potential for reverse causation (problematic drinking causing damage to social
networks, leading to loneliness). With conventional epidemiological methods, controlling for
(residual) confounding and reverse causality is difficult. In this study, we apply Mendelian
randomisation (MR) to assess bi-directional causal effects between loneliness on the one hand and
smoking behaviour and alcohol (ab)use on the other. Design: We applied bi-directional MR using
summary-level data of the largest available genome-wide association studies of loneliness
(n=511,280), smoking (initiation (n=249,171), cigarettes-per-day (n=249,171) and cessation
(n=143,852)), alcoholic drinks-per-week (n=226,223) and alcohol dependence (n=46,568), using
independent samples. For each relationship, we selected genetic variants predictive of the exposure
variable as instruments and tested their association with the outcome variable. Effect estimates for
individual variants were combined with inverse-variance weighted regression (gene-outcome/geneexposure association) and the robustness of these findings was assessed with five different sensitivity
methods. Findings: There was weak evidence of increased loneliness leading to higher likelihood of
initiating smoking and smoking more cigarettes, and a lower likelihood of quitting smoking.
Additionally, there was evidence that initiating smoking increases loneliness. We found no evidence
of a causal effect between loneliness and alcohol (ab)use. Conclusions: We report tentative evidence
for causal, bidirectional, increasing effects between loneliness and cigarette smoking. These findings
improve our understanding of the interrelatedness of smoking and loneliness, however, replication
with better powered genetic instruments is recommended.

Background
Extreme and prolonged loneliness is associated with worse physical and mental health1,2, with
evidence that loneliness and social isolation are comparable in magnitude to other well-established
risk factors for mortality3. One proposed explanation is that loneliness is associated with poor health
behaviours4. Studies indicate 5-30% of adults are lonely5,6,7,8, suggesting high relevance for public
health in identifying causal links between loneliness and health behaviours6, 7.
There is a particularly consistent link between loneliness and tobacco smoking and alcohol
use; two of the most detrimental health behaviours worldwide. Lonely individuals are more likely to
be cigarette smokers4,9, potentially resulting from smokers’ attempts to regain belonging in
environments where smoking is socially acceptable10. Feelings of loneliness are associated with higher
smoking in a nationally representative sample of adults10 and social support appears beneficial when
considering and maintaining smoking cessation11. Similarly, greater daily alcohol use is associated with
lack of social activity amongst older adults in the general population12 and clinical samples2,13.
Furthermore, there are strong genetic correlations between loneliness and increased alcohol
dependence, smoking heaviness, likelihood to initiate smoking and decreased likelihood of smoking
cessation5, suggesting possible causal pathways. However, in order to support a causal effect, we must
first rule out residual confounding. For example, alcohol consumption is partly determined by societal
attitudes to alcohol14 and stress (perhaps exacerbated by loneliness) may also play an indirect role in
risky behaviours15 like excessive drinking. Furthermore, there remains potential for reverse causality;
as problematic drinking may cause damage to and limit social networks, leading to loneliness.
To date, only observational studies have examined associations between substance use and
loneliness. With observational data, it is difficult to control for the effects of residual confounding and
reverse causation. In this study, we apply Mendelian randomisation (MR) to assess bi-directional
causal effects between loneliness and smoking behaviour and loneliness and alcohol (ab)use.

Methods
MR is an instrumental variable method, using genetic variants as a proxy for an exposure to estimate
the effect of that exposure on an outcome16. MR can provide evidence of a causal effect that avoids
bias from confounding and reverse causation, if the following hold: 1) genetic variants robustly predict
the exposure, 2) genetic variants are not associated with confounders, and 3)genetic variants are only
associated with the outcome through the exposure. The latter two assumptions can be violated by
horizontal pleiotropy, which occurs when one genetic variant directly influences two traits, inducing
spurious causal effect. We conduct multiple sensitivity analyses, each with different assumptions, to
test for pleiotropy.

Data
We applied bi-directional MR using summary-level data of published genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) of loneliness (n=511,280)5, smoking (initiation (n=249,171), cigarettes-per-day (n=249,171
smokers) and cessation (n=143,852))18, and alcohol use (drinks-per-week (n=226,223)17 and alcohol
dependence (n=46,568)1. The sample sizes for the smoking variables and for alcoholic drinks are
considerably lower than in the original GWAS because we based our analyses on summary-level data
with UKBiobank and 23andMe, Inc. samples removed. This was to avoid sample overlap which can
cause bias towards the observational association.

Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted using the TwoSampleMR package for R19, 20. Briefly, independent variants
that passed the genome-wide level of significance (p<5x10-8) in the exposure GWAS were selected as
instruments. This provided 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for loneliness5, 378 SNPs for
smoking initiation17, 99 SNPs for drinks-per-week 17 and 11 SNPs for alcohol dependence18. Because

there were relatively few genome-wide significant SNPs for loneliness and alcohol dependence, we
added instruments with relaxed p-value thresholds of p<1x10-5 for both. SNPs were clumped for
independence at r2 <0.01 and 10,000 kb19. Next, these sets of SNPs were identified in the outcome
GWAS. Cigarettes-per-day and smoking cessation could only be used as outcome variables because
those GWAS only contained ‘ever-smokers’; and there was insufficient information to stratify by
smoking status in the loneliness GWAS.
The main analysis was an inverse-variance weighted (IVW) regression model (SNP–outcome
association/SNP–exposure, whereby each SNP is weighted according to the inverse of its variance).
We applied five sensitivity methods; weighted median21, weighted mode22, MREgger23, Steiger
filtering24, and generalized summary-based MR(GSMR)25. A consistent result across these methods
would provide the greatest confidence a causal effect. The reliability of MR Egger is evaluated using
the I2GX statistic26. We also calculated the mean F-statistic to test instrument strength (F>10 being
sufficiently strong) and Cochran’s Q to estimate heterogeneity between the SNP effects which might
suggest pleiotropy.

Results
Causal effects of loneliness on substance use
With the p<1x10-5 threshold only, there was weak evidence of increased loneliness leading to a higher
likelihood of initiating smoking (IVW !=0.10, 95% CI=0.06 to 0.13, p=4.6e-05, see Table 1) and smoking
more cigarettes-per-day once started (IVW !=0.09, 95% CI=0.03 to 0.15, p=0.005). With both p-value
thresholds, there was weak evidence for increased loneliness decreasing the odds of smoking
cessation (IVW (p<5e-08) !=-0.09, 95% CI=-0.19 to 0.01, p=0.075; IVW (p<1e-05) !=-0.09, 95% CI =0.13 to -0.05, p=1.3e-04). Mostly, results were consistent across the weighted median and GSMR
sensitivity methods in effect size and direction of effect (with slightly weaker statistical evidence), but
not with the weighted mode. MR-Egger results were not reported due to low reliability based on the

I2GX (Supplementary Table 3). For loneliness-smoking initiation and loneliness-cigarettes-per-day there
was evidence of heterogeneity as measured with Cochran’s Q, while for loneliness-smoking cessation
that was not the case (Supplementary Table2). Steiger filtering showed that all (except one) SNPs
explained more variance in the exposure than in the outcomes, suggesting the effects were not due
to reverse causation (Supplementary Table5). We found no clear evidence for causal effects of
loneliness on alcohol (ab)use.

Causal effects of substance use on loneliness
Across the different MR methods, there was consistent evidence of a causal influence of smoking
initiation on increased loneliness (IVW !=0.30, 95% CI=0.22 to 0.38, p=2.8e-13), despite the
instrument being relatively weak (F-statistic Supplementary Table1). However, there was particularly
strong evidence of SNP-heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q 729.30, p=1.5e-40), implying there could still be
some horizontal pleiotropy for this relationship. With Steiger filtering the majority of SNPs, 277 of 287,
explained more variance in the exposure than the outcome. There was very weak evidence of an
increasing effect of drinks-per-week on loneliness with IVW (!=0.09, 95% CI=-0.02 to 0.22, p=0.076),
but this did not hold up with any of the sensitivity methods. Finally, there was no clear evidence for
causal effects of alcohol dependence on loneliness.

Discussion
This is the first MR study exploring bi-directional associations between loneliness and substance use.
We report tentative evidence for bidirectional effects between loneliness and smoking behaviour,
such that loneliness increases the odds of initiating smoking, heavier smoking once started, and
finding it difficult to quit, and that smoking initiation increases the odds of experiencing loneliness.

The fact that our evidence was not consistent for all sensitivity methods could be due to
limited power and warrants further replication when larger sample sizes are available. Our findings
that loneliness increases smoking are in line with pre-existing observations that lack of social
connectedness may lead to increased smoking and difficulty in quitting27,28. Our finding of potential
causal effects of smoking on loneliness is particularly interesting, and consistent with recent results
from an MR study that found that smoking increases depressive symptoms29. The mechanism for this
may result from inhaled nicotine acting on nicotinic cholinergic receptors, disrupting the release of
neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, well-established players in the aetiology of
depression. Feelings of loneliness and depressive symptoms are highly phenotypically and genetically
correlated30, 5 and so it seems that the (biological) effects of smoking that could lead to depressive
feelings plausibly also lead to higher odds of experiencing loneliness. Other constituents of tobacco
smoke could also impact neurotransmitters, with suggestions that MAO inhibition is also implicated30.
Apart from some weak evidence that having more alcoholic drinks-per-week increases
loneliness, which was not supported by any of the sensitivity methods, there was no clear indication
of causal effects between loneliness and alcohol use. Further studies with better-powered genetic
instruments are needed to fully assess the link between drinks-per-week and loneliness. Future work
should also look at drinking frequency as there may be complexities such that loneliness is associated
with extremes of drinking frequency rather than moderate drinking31. There may also be differences
when considering frequency compared with quantity of alcohol consumption per occasion, with
evidence indicating the former is generally positively correlated with health outcomes, whilst the
latter is negatively correlated32. In addition, we found no clear evidence overall for effects between
loneliness and alcohol dependence. While this could be due to low statistical power, it does align with
some literature showing no evidence of an association between loneliness and at-risk drinking, binge
drinking and extreme alcohol use31 33.

There are some important strengths to our study. We are first to apply MR using the largest
available GWAS to examine bi-directional results between smoking and loneliness and alcohol and
loneliness. We maximised the robustness of our findings by using a wide range of MR (sensitivity)
methods, attempting to overcome the issue of horizontal pleiotropy. Applying multiple different MR
methods, which each make different assumptions about the nature of pleiotropy, aims to overcome
any individual limitation of a specific method. As required for MR, we also excluded overlapping
samples; for example, if the GWAS for the exposure had contained the same people as for the
outcome, then this result would be biased towards the observed estimate16.
However, there are some limitations. First, the genetic instrument for loneliness was relatively
weak due to the small number of genome-wide significant SNPs. Therefore, we relaxed p-value
thresholds for instrument selection to increase the number of SNPs in the instrument. This could
increase the likelihood of pleiotropy, which we attempted to overcome by using a variety of sensitivity
methods. While the instrument for smoking initiation was also of arguably low strength (given the Fstatistic <10), we did find considerable evidence for causal effects. While it therefore did not appear
to have limited our findings, replication of these results with stronger genetic instruments is advised.
The loneliness GWAS is predominately based on the UKBiobank cohort; even after controlling for
population structure, coincident structure and geographic clustering remain34,35, potentially
introducing bias. We attempted to overcome this by ensuring the outcome sample did not overlap
with UKBiobank. Additionally, there may be selection bias; UKBiobank participants are well-educated,
healthier and less likely smokers compared to the general population36. Loneliness rates may
therefore not be representative. If smoking, alcohol use, and/or loneliness reduce likelihood of
participating in the UKBiobank, we would lack results for those most significantly affected – meaning
our results may underestimate the association. Finally, our judgement of loneliness as a nominal
variable is arguably flawed; failing to account for those intermittently but intensely lonely, or those
with limited social connectedness, but who enjoy or benefit from this solitude33,37.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we are first to examine bi-directional effects between loneliness and health
behaviours with an MR framework. Although there was no clear evidence for effects between
loneliness and alcohol (neither drinks-per-week nor alcohol dependence), there was moderate
evidence for bi-directional effects between loneliness and smoking, which is supported by existing
literature. We recommend our analyses be repeated using a stronger genetic instrument for loneliness
in the future, which would increase the power of these findings. For now however, our findings are of
relevance for population health. The negative health impacts of both smoking and loneliness have
been established and addressing these factors in conjunction with a newfound understanding of their
interrelatedness, seems an important public health goal. This could include an increased emphasis on
social and interpersonal methods for smoking cessation and a greater recognition of the impact of
loneliness on individuals using existing smoking cessation services.
