ABSTRACT:
Objectives: Chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are
heterogeneous and often co-morbid, with increasing global prevalence. Uncontrolled type 2
diabetes (T2D) can result in severe inflammatory complications. As neutrophils are essential to
inflammation, we conducted RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses to investigate the association
between neutrophil gene expression and T2D phenotype. Further, as specialized pro-resolving
lipid mediators, including resolvin E1 (RvE1), can actively resolve inflammation, we further
surveyed the impact of RvE1 on isolated neutrophils.
Methods: Cell isolation and RNA-seq analysis of neutrophils from N=11 T2D and N=7 healthy
individuals with available clinical data was conducted. Additionally, cultured neutrophils (N=3
T2D, N=3 healthy) were perturbed with increasing RvE1 doses (0nM, 1nM, 10nM, or 100nM)
prior to RNA-seq. Data was evaluated through a bioinformatics pipeline including pathway
analysis and post hoc false-discovery rate (FDR)-correction.
Results: We observed significant differential expression of 50 genes between T2D and healthy
neutrophils (p<0.05), including decreased T2D gene expression in inflammatory- and lipidrelated genes SLC9A4, NECTIN2 and PLPP3 (p<0.003). RvE1 treatment induced dosedependent differential gene expression (uncorrected p<0.05) across groups, including 59 healthy
and 216 T2D neutrophil genes. Comparing T2D to healthy neutrophils, 1097 genes were
differentially expressed across RvE1 doses, including two significant genes, LILRB5 and
AKR1C1, involved in inflammation (p<0.05).
Conclusions: Inflammatory- and lipid-related genes were differentially expressed between T2D
and healthy neutrophils, and RvE1 dose-dependently modified gene expression in both groups.

Introduction:
The increasing global prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as diabetes, is of
critical concern to human health. The global prevalence of diagnosed adult diabetes was ~415
million in 2015, and is estimated to rise to ~642 million by 2040 (1). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is
modulated by defective metabolic and immune responses and can lead to inflammatory
complications, including kidney, nerve, cardiovascular, eye, and periodontal diseases (2), with
up to 60% of diabetic individuals having moderate to severe periodontitis (3). Nevertheless, the
endogenous pathways that trigger and sustain unresolved low-grade inflammation in T2D are not
completely understood. While acute inflammation is a protective immune response, chronic
inflammatory diseases result from uncontrolled inflammation and failure of immune cells to
restore homeostasis. In particular, the critical role of neutrophils in both the initiation and
resolution of inflammation has become apparent, with neutrophil abnormalities a common link
across chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes (4–8). Such neutrophil abnormalities in
chronic, unresolved inflammation include impaired neutrophil adhesion, migration, chemotaxis,
cytokine signaling, and phagocytosis, as well as increased neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress
and degranulation (4, 5, 9). Appropriate resolution of inflammation programs aim to restore
tissue homeostasis following acute inflammation and neutrophil migration (5, 10). This active
process involves key endogenous lipid ligand mediators, such as the specialized pro-resolving
mediator resolvin E1 (RvE1), which can bind and transduce agonist signals through innate
immune receptors on neutrophils to resolve inflammation (4, 11).
Despite considerable exploration in the genetics of T2D, primarily through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS), and the identification of over 200 implicated genomic regions, to
date there has been limited ability to translate genetic information into clinically actionable

subtypes of this highly heterogeneous condition (12, 13). Further, identified genomic variants
tend to have very small effect sizes and these genetic studies have been heavily biased by
inclusion of primarily European populations. While genetics unequivocally plays an important
role in T2D, with heritability estimates ranging from a low of 25% to a large twin cohort that
estimated 72% heritability (14), the role of gene expression has been less studied, particularly in
the context of disease-relevant cell types. Indeed, as T2D is associated with both increased
adipose tissue and circulating inflammatory mediators, which induce insulin resistance and
develop a state of chronic and unresolved inflammation (15), a global survey of transcriptomics
provides an unbiased method to investigate functional mechanisms of T2D. Non-targeted,
unbiased transcriptomics thus has the potential to elucidate novel mechanisms important for
disease biomarkers and drug efficacy, especially by revealing unknown pathways of myeloid
immune cells and providing dynamic molecular information important to understanding
neutrophil heterogeneity in disease.
As neutrophils are essential to both initiation and resolution of inflammation and their
gene expression in diabetes has not been previously studied, we conducted RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) transcriptomic analyses to investigate gene expression in human neutrophils from
T2D and healthy subjects. In this study, we found that T2D individuals had higher blood glucose
and more advanced periodontal disease compared to healthy individuals, consistent with
worsening overall systemic health. When we investigated global neutrophil gene expression, we
observed significant downregulation of several inflammatory- or lipid metabolism-related genes
in T2D neutrophils. We further conducted a perturbation study to investigate the impact of
exogenous RvE1 treatment on T2D and healthy neutrophil gene expression and the inflammatory
cytokine signaling response. Our results demonstrate distinct trends in gene expression and

transcriptomics in type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods:
Study Subjects
Subject recruitment has been described previously (11). Briefly, T2D and healthy
subjects were recruited from the patient cohorts of the Center for Clinical and Translational
Research at the Forsyth Institute under Forsyth Institute Institutional Review Board-approved
protocols (Protocol #11-03 and #13-07). All subjects gave signed informed consent prior to study
evaluations. Clinical periodontal data and peripheral venous blood were collected. The diagnosis
of T2D was made by the subject’s primary care physician following American Association of
Diabetes guidelines (16). Information was collected on subject demographics (age, gender, selfreported ethnicity, and self-reported smoking status), body-mass index (BMI; kg/m2), blood total
cholesterol, blood glucose (point-of-care), percent hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and periodontal
condition (17). HbA1c was used to determine the level of glycemic control for diabetic subjects.
Neutrophil and monocyte cell counts were determined by lab assay (described below).
Individuals were excluded if they were taking insulin sensitizers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, or antimicrobials within 3 months of study initiation. For this transcriptomics study, a
total of 13 T2D and 8 healthy subjects were included for analysis, all of whom were unrelated
and over 18 years of age (range: 29-70 years of age). This included 11 T2D and 7 healthy
subjects in the main transcriptomics analysis of serum neutrophils, as well as 3 T2D and 3
healthy subjects whose neutrophils were cultured for perturbation experiments (1 T2D and 2
healthy subjects were included in both the main and perturbation analyses). All cell culture and
transcriptomics analysis were performed at the Forsyth Institute. Data analysis and cytokine
experiments were completed at the J. Craig Venter Institute.

Human Neutrophil Isolation and Cell Culture
Human neutrophils were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll-Histopaque densitygradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077 and Histopaque-1119; Sigma-Aldrich), as has been
described previously (11). Briefly, neutrophils were isolated after isotonic lysis of RBCs and
counted with a hemocytometer; neutrophil viability (>95%) was assessed using trypan blue
live/dead staining (18). Monocyte exclusion was completed by plating. A separate monocyte
fraction was isolated for monocyte counting. For culture experiments, isolated neutrophils were
incubated with RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v) (Life
Technologies) at 37°C. Wright-Giemsa staining was used to identify individual cell types and
confirm neutrophil isolation and purity (routinely >98%) (11).

Resolvin Perturbation Experiments
After cell isolation, cultured neutrophils from T2D subjects (N=3) and healthy controls
(N=3) were treated with one of four doses of exogenous RvE1 (0nM, 1nM, 10nM, or 100nM) in
RPMI and cultured for 1 hour at 37°C. Following incubation, cells were spun down and divided
in half for protein and RNA-seq analyses, respectively. Cell culture supernatant was frozen at 80°C and extracted for subsequent cytokine analyses. For the perturbation experiments, gene
expression was compared between exogenous RvE1 dose-response treatmentsin 1) T2D
neutrophils only, 2) healthy neutrophils only, and 3) T2D versus healthy neutrophils.

Cytokine Analyses
Frozen (-80°C) cell culture supernatant from the perturbation experiments (N=3 T2D and
N=3 healthy subject cultured neutrophils perturbed at 0nM, 1nM, 10nM, or 100nM RvE1) was

brought up to room temperature and assayed using the Invitrogen human inflammation 20-plex
ProcartaPlex cytokine panel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Luminex 200 instrument (Luminex)
in RPMI. The 20 assayed cytokines were: MIP-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, TNF-α, MIP-1β, IFN-α, MCP-1, P-Selectin, IL-1α,
sICAM-1, and E-Selectin. Following manufacturer protocols, all samples were run on a plate
with 7 standards (diluted 1:4) and a control (RPMI only), with all samples, standards, and
controls run in duplicate (19).
Quality control (QC) steps were conducted according to manufacturer recommendations.
Briefly, any standards with <70 or >130 % recovery of beads were invalidated. Samples were
also checked to ensure they had a bead count of >30 beads recovered (all samples had >100
beads recovered and none were excluded at this step). Results were reported as average pg/mL
for all measured cytokines following QC. Values at or below the lower limit of quantification
(LLOQ) for each cytokine (based on the standard curve after QC) were reported at the LLOQ
(the average value of the lowest validated standards). LLOQ for the cytokines (in pg/mL) were
as follows: MIP-1α=7.18, IL-1β=8.84, IL-4=155.02, IP-10= 4.67, IL-6=29.64, IL-8=2.47, IL10=8.37, IL-12p70=12.23, IL-13=5.61, IL-17A=30.68, IFN-γ=12.28, GM-CSF=231.09, TNFα=9.74, MIP-1β=30.76, IFN-α=2.10, MCP-1=15.01, P-Selectin=1089.78, IL-1α=2.92, sICAM1=445.56, and E-Selectin=2894.92.
To compare cytokine levels between groups, unpaired t-tests were used with a
significance threshold of p<0.05 and no assumption of consistent standard deviation.

RNA-seq was conducted identically for both the serum and cell culture neutrophil
experiments. Briefly, RNA was trizol extracted and quantified by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) to
confirm RNA-quality (RIN score cutoff of 7.5). Library preparation was conducted using a
TruSeq stranded mRNA kit (Illumina), with quality confirmed by Bioanlyzer and sequencing
conducted with a Nextseq 500 high output v2 kit on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). Resulting
RNA-seq data was evaluated through a standard bioinformatics pipeline. Briefly, paired-end
Illumina sequencing reads were mapped to GRCh38, after quality filtering and trimming, and
quantified using STAR v.2.2.0.1 (20) with all default parameters (except
“outFilterMismatchNoverLmax” set at 0.05). Reads mapped to each gene in the genome were
quantified using htseq-count v.0.9.1 (21) with the following parameters: “-f bam -r pos -s yes”.
Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using edgeR v.3.18.1 (22). Genes
were excluded from subsequent analysis if they did not have a count per million (CPM)>4 in at
least 4 samples. The weighted trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method (22) was used for
normalization. Common dispersion was estimated with parameters method="deviance",
robust=TRUE. Trended dispersion and tag-wise dispersion was estimated with default
parameters. Gene counts were fitted with a negative binomial generalized log-linear model.
Likelihood ratio tests were conducted for the specified contrasts of the coefficients, and multiple
testing was subjected to a false discovery rate (FDR) correction.
Genes of interest were highlighted for visualization using R library “beanplot” (23).
Heatmaps highlighting significant genes used relative abundances built using R library “vegan”
(24) and rendered using R library “heatmap.2”.

We also conducted pathway analyses using iPathwayGuide (Advaita Bio). For the main
analysis, we subjected the list of all FDR-corrected p-values to association with pathway
networks using a threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance (p-value) and a log fold change
(FC) of expression with an absolute value of at least 0.6. Pathways were analyzed from the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Release 84.0+/10-26, Oct 17)
(25, 26) and Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium database (2017-Nov6) (27, 28), as well as
investigating the network of regulatory relations from BioGRID: Biological General Repository
for Interaction Datasets v3.4.154. October 25th, 2017 (29), and diseases from the KEGG
database (25, 26).
Over-represented (uncorrected p<0.05) and statistically significant associations
(Bonferroni or FDR-adjusted p<0.05) with pathway classifications for “disease pathways”,
“biological processes”, “molecular functions”, and “cellular components” were captured. The
underlying differentially expressed genes from the strongest pathway classifications were
rendered and expression levels presented in heatmaps using the R library “heatmap.plus”.
For the heatmaps, additional KEGG terms of interest were selected based on previous
literature regarding dental outcomes and the development of T2D (3, 8, 12). These additional
terms were highlighted as part of significant networks from the iPathwayGuide analysis, such as
the JAK-Stat signaling pathway. Relative abundances for the subset of genes assigned to these
terms in the KEGG database (25, 26) were used for rendering to labelled heatmaps.

Results:
Clinical Characteristics of Study Subjects
Our study population (including both the main transcriptomics and cell culture
perturbation analyses) consisted of 13 T2D cases and 8 healthy controls with clinical and
demographic information on: age, gender, self-reported ethnicity, self-reported smoking status,
BMI, blood total cholesterol, blood glucose, percent HbA1c, periodontal condition, neutrophil
cell counts, and monocyte cell counts (Table 1). The T2D individuals in the cohort had higher
blood glucose and more advanced periodontal disease compared to healthy individuals. Diabetes
diagnosis was confirmed by elevated blood glucose and HbA1c levels, with blood
glucose>126mg/dl and HbA1c>6.5% indicating diabetes, consistent with clinical criteria and the
literature (16); HbA1c was not measured for healthy control individuals in this cohort. T2D
individuals tended to have higher cholesterol, BMI, neutrophil counts, and monocyte counts, but
these factors did not reach statistical significance, while T2D individuals were significantly older
than healthy individuals (p=0.007).

Global Gene Expression Levels of Neutrophils in Health and Disease
We observed statistically significant differential expression of 50 genes (FDR-corrected
p<0.05, Figure 1A, Table 2, Figure S1) between T2D and healthy neutrophils. Differentially
expressed genes were primarily inflammatory- or lipid-associated and were almost universally
downregulated in T2D individuals relative to healthy individuals, with the exception of GTSCR1
(Gilles de la Tourette syndrome chromosome region, candidate 1), a non-coding RNA gene that
was upregulated in T2D neutrophils.
The top 3 differentially expressed genes were downregulated in T2D neutrophils (Figure
1B): inflammatory signaling gene SLC9A4 (solute carrier family 9 member A4; log(FC)=-5.42,

FDR-corrected p=0.001), immune regulating gene NECTIN2 (nectin cell adhesion molecule 2;
log(FC)=-3.77, FDR-corrected p=0.002), and anti-inflammatory gene PLPP3 (phospholipid
phosphatase 3; log(FC)=-5.37, FDR-corrected p=0.002); while only GTSCR1 was upregulated in
T2D neutrophils (log(FC)=3.71, FDR-corrected p=0.02, Figure 1B).
Of the significant differentially expressed neutrophil genes, 34% (17/50) had known
immune or inflammation related roles, with 24% (12/50) of genes linked to lipid or glucose
metabolism (Table 2). In addition to NECTIN2 and PLPP3, 15 other annotated immune or
inflammation associated genes had significantly lower gene expression in T2D neutrophils
(Table 2), while KCNH4, GNPDA1, TLCD2, VEGFA, MFSD2A, PNPLA1, GPR4, and LPCAT1
showed lower expression in T2D neutrophils and had previously been linked to lipid or glucose
metabolism. Indeed, several significant differentially expressed genes, including PLPP3,
SPHK1, ABCG1, and PTGES, have previously been indicated to have both lipid- and
inflammatory-related roles.
This interaction between lipid and inflammatory pathways was further evident when we
investigated neutrophil gene expression by biological pathways and observed that most of the
significant biological pathways were lipid-related, despite the abundance of immune- and
inflammatory-related genes among our significant results (Table 3, Figures S2-S3).
Overall, 13 pathways and 19 diseases were over-represented (uncorrected p<0.05) in our
cohort by gene expression differences. The top 5 over-represented KEGG pathways were heavily
lipid-related: sphingolipid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, phospholipase D signaling
pathway, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism; though
only sphingolipid metabolism was statistically significant after Bonferroni or FDR correction
(corrected p=0.02, Figure S3). Of the 19 over-represented diseases, 15 remained significant by

FDR correction, but none remained significant after Bonferroni correction, and all 19 had only a
single differentially expressed gene represented in that particular disease pathway. The top 5
disease pathways were: citrullinemia, Paget's disease, endometriosis, junctional epidermolysis
bullosa, and avascular necrosis/osteonecrosis of femoral head. Additionally, top GO biological
process, molecular function, and cellular component pathways were interrogated (27, 28).
Though none reached significance after Bonferroni or FDR correction, the top GO pathways also
included lipid-related and plasma membrane pathways (Table 3).
When we investigated the top KEGG and GO biological pathways (Table 3) by
individual gene expression across the top 50 genes, we observed hierarchical clustering of
pathway and gene expression by groups of individuals (Figure 2). These clusters primarily
separated out diabetic and healthy individuals and included disease heterogeneity in gene levels.

Neutrophil Gene Expression by Lipid Ligand Resolvin E1 Dose-Response
Because endogenous inflammatory pathways are deficient in chronic inflammatory
diseases like T2D, we aimed to understand whether treating isolated neutrophils with an
exogenous lipid ligand resolution mediator, RvE1, would impact transcription phenotypes.
We conducted a perturbation experiment across a range of clinically relevant RvE1 doses
(0-100nM) and observed that, as expected, dosing of the RvE1 ligand impacted T2D neutrophils
differently than healthy neutrophils. We investigated this dose-response phenotype between three
comparisons: 1) T2D neutrophils only, 2) healthy neutrophils only, and 3) T2D vs. healthy
neutrophils.
RvE1 treatment induced differential gene expression (uncorrected p<0.05) across doses
(Figure 3), including 59 genes in healthy and 216 genes in T2D neutrophils. Comparing T2D to

healthy neutrophils, 1097 genes were differentially expressed across treatment doses, including
two statistically significant (FDR-corrected p<0.05) inflammatory genes, LILRB5 (leukocyte
immunoglobulin like receptor B5) and AKR1C1 (aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1).
Neutrophils from T2D subjects had a stronger response to RvE1 treatment dose-dependently
(more differentially expressed genes), particularly at the clinically relevant dose, 100nM (11)
(117 differentially expressed genes between100nM and 10nM RvE1), showing modified gene
expression by RvE1 treatment. In contrast, healthy neutrophils were not as perturbed by RvE1
dosing (few differentially expressed genes between doses), though some effect was observed at
the 10nM dose (25 differentially expressed genes between 10nM and 0nM RvE1). Treatment of
T2D neutrophils with 100nM RvE1 resulted in a reduction in the number of differentially
expressed genes in T2D neutrophils compared to healthy neutrophils (98 genes when T2D
neutrophils were treated with 100nM RvE1 versus 169 genes without RvE1 treatment, 0nM).
An interesting observation was that, in general, the differentially expressed neutrophil
genes across RvE1 doses tended to be unique to each comparison: 1) T2D, 2) healthy, or 3) T2D
vs. healthy groups. Within each comparison the genes differentially expressed remained mostly
consistent across RvE1 doses. However, the genes differentially expressed between T2D and
healthy neutrophils in the cell culture perturbation model without RvE1 treatment were generally
not the same as the significant differentially expressed serum neutrophil genes observed in the
main analysis, with the exception of NECTIN2, HTRA3, and ABCG1, which were differentially
expressed in both serum and cell culture. Interestingly, when we perturbed T2D neutrophils with
100nM RvE1 and did not perturb healthy neutrophils, only HTRA3 remained strongly
differentially expressed (p<0.05), while NECTIN2 and ABCG1 showed less differential

expression. Overall, there were distinct trends in neutrophil responses to RvE1 perturbation
between diabetic and healthy neutrophils in cell culture.

Diabetic and Healthy Neutrophil Cytokines Respond Differently to Resolvin E1 Perturbation
To confirm that gene expression changes influenced neutrophil protein expression, we
analyzed cytokine production of neutrophil cell culture supernatants following the same RvE1
dose-response studies. Results showed trends of differential inflammatory cytokine
concentrations between T2D and healthy neutrophils and across RvE1 doses. Out of a panel of
20 human cytokines, the concentration of 8 cytokines (MIP-1α, IL-4, IL-8, MIP-1β, P-Selectin,
sICAM-1, TNF-α, and IL-1α) were within the range of quantification and were included in the
analysis (Figure 4, Table S1). Without any RvE1 perturbation there were differences in levels of
these cytokines between T2D and healthy cell cultured neutrophils, with T2D neutrophils having
higher TNF-α and P-Selectin levels but lower MIP-1β, IL-8, and sICAM-1 levels (Figure 4A).
Across all RvE1 doses, P-Selectin and sICAM-1 levels remained consistently higher, while IL-8
levels remained lower in T2D compared to healthy neutrophils. However, at 1nM RvE1
treatment, MIP-1β levels in T2D neutrophils rose to the baseline levels of healthy neutrophils,
while healthy neutrophil levels stayed consistent. At higher RvE1 doses, including 10nM and
100nM, MIP-1β levels rose in both T2D and healthy neutrophils; there was a stronger, dosedependent increase among healthy neutrophils. After treatment with 10nM or 100nM RvE1,
TNF-α levels were elevated in healthy neutrophils, reaching levels seen in T2D neutrophils; a
similar effect was observed at 100nM RvE1 for P-Selectin, though healthy levels (1511pg/mL)
did not rise to fully match T2D levels (1751pg/mL). We also observed some distinct neutrophil
cytokine profiles in individual subjects, consistent with known inter-individual cytokine

variation. The cytokine level differences did not reach statistical significance at this sample size.
Overall, we observed trends of several potentially interesting differences in cytokines between
T2D and healthy neutrophils, indicating that both diabetic and healthy neutrophils may have a
distinct functional signaling response to RvE1 treatment in a dose-dependent manner.

Discussion:
We conducted the first study of neutrophil gene expression in the chronic inflammatory
disease type 2 diabetes. We observed differential expression between T2D and healthy
neutrophils of several inflammatory- or lipid-associated genes, indicating the potential for
distinct transcriptomic profiles between these groups among a key and novel immune cell type.
Further, as many of the significant differentially expressed genes had direct lipid- or
glucogenesis-related roles, neutrophil transcriptomics may provide a window directly into
relevant disease pathogenesis beyond their role in immune or inflammatory genes.
The top genes significantly down-regulated in T2D neutrophils compared to healthy
neutrophils tended to be biologically relevant across inflammatory- and lipid-associated gene
pathways and included SLC9A4, NECTIN2, and PLPP3.
SLC9A4 is a plasma membrane solute carrier protein that acts in homeostatic pH
regulation and proton transport, including to eliminate metabolism-generated acids and absorb
sodium, with an important role in signal transduction (30, 31). SLC9A4 is in a genomic region
with genes involved in the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) and IL-18 pathways (32, 33). This SLC9A4/IL1R/IL-18 locus has important roles in cytokine signaling and inflammatory response (32, 33).
The IL-18 pathway induces synthesis of the cytokine IFN- γ in T cells, which has been shown to
act in mucosal inflammation in celiac disease (32, 34). Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory
and autoimmune disease that shares several genetic risk loci with type 1 diabetes (32). A celiac
disease GWAS identified associations with the SLC9A4/IL-1R/IL-18 locus, and a variant in this
locus further showed an allelic dosage effect that reduced IL18RAP mRNA expression in celiac
patients, indicating a direct link between this locus' genotype and biologically relevant gene
expression in a chronic inflammatory disease (32). This reduced IL-18 cytokine expression in
celiac disease is consistent with the overall reduced expression of SLC9A4 observed among

diabetic neutrophils in our study. Another GWAS linked SLC9A4 with regulation of IL-33/ST2
(suppression of tumorigenicity 2, part of the IL-1R family) signaling, which has previously been
implicated in both immune and inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular disease (33). In
addition, a variant in SLC9A4 was associated with eosinophil, though not neutrophil, cell counts
in a GWAS of white blood cell subtypes utilizing subjects from the BioBank Japan Project,
further indicating a direct role for SLC9A4 in immune cell activity (35).
NECTIN2 is a cholesterol responsive, adherens junction plasma membrane glycoprotein
(36, 37). NECTIN2 is also involved in extravasation and angiogenesis, and may act at vascular
inflammation sites to regulate transendothelial leukocyte migration (36, 37). This study is the
first exploration of NECTIN2 expression in neutrophils. We observed downregulation of
NECTIN2 among T2D subjects, which is consistent with a continuous cell migration phenotype.
Further, we observed higher cholesterol levels among our T2D subjects, consistent with both the
role of NECTIN2 and the known propensity for high cholesterol in diabetic patients. Previous
evidence has shown that NECTIN2 also regulates immune system responses, including
modulating T cell signaling and viral pathogenesis (38). Further, NECTIN2 has shown potential
associations with several diseases, including chronic inflammatory diseases.
PLPP3 is a plasma membrane adherens junction phospholipid phosphatase that converts
phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and has roles in lipid metabolism and Wnt signaling (30, 39,
40). The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in a menagerie of cellular functions and
development, and its dysfunction has been linked to diseases including cancer, metabolic
syndrome, diabetes, and diabetic neuropathy (41). It has also previously been demonstrated that
silencing PLPP3 in an endothelial cell line enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion, leukocyte
adhesion, cell survival, and migration, while its overexpression reversed those effects and instead

induced apoptosis (42). This is consistent with our observation of reduced PLPP3 expression
among T2D neutrophils, as PLPP3 normally acts in a protective role as a negative regulator of
inflammatory cytokines and leukocyte adhesion. In addition, GWAS have previously associated
variants in PLPP3 with several chronic inflammatory diseases, including coronary artery disease
(43–46) and eosinophilic esophagitis (47). Thus, the lipid regulatory and anti-inflammatory roles
of PLPP3 in chronic inflammatory diseases lend further evidence for a metabolic-immune axis
in diabetes (8).
It is worth note that our study of neutrophil transcriptomics found that most significant
gene expression was downregulated in T2D neutrophils compared to healthy neutrophils. It has
traditionally been thought that gene expression in diabetic individuals would be increased,
particularly among inflammatory and immune genes, and indeed gene expression studies of
pancreatic islet cells showed increased gene expression in diabetes (48). However, as neutrophils
experience severe dysregulation in individuals with chronic inflammatory disease (4, 5, 9), we do
not believe it is surprising to see a downregulation of many key immune and inflammatory
genes. Diabetic neutrophils are known to exhibit impaired immune responses and cell migration
(4, 5, 9), and we observed a marked reduction in neutrophil chemotaxis in T2D compared to
healthy neutrophils (data not shown), consistent with the downregulated gene expression
observed in this study. Further, a recent study in adipose tissue showed that apolipoprotein M
expression was decreased in T2D and obese individuals compared to lean individuals (49),
further indicating a role for downregulation of genes in diabetes pathogenesis.
When we further explored neutrophil gene expression by biological pathways, we
observed strong links between lipid- and inflammatory-associated genes and pathways, further
emphasizing the role of the metabolic-immune axis in diabetes (8). Plasma membrane cellular

pathways were also over-represented, consistent with the roles of our top differentially expressed
genes. Hierarchical clustering of over-represented and biologically relevant pathways by
individual expression of significant differentially expressed genes in these pathways tended to
sort individuals by disease status. However, disease heterogeneity could be observed in the
clustering, with some T2D individuals in a healthy cluster and vice versa, indicating the potential
to identify subsets of disease severity through neutrophil transcriptomics.
To investigate the functional activity of T2D and healthy neutrophils and whether
diabetic neutrophil dysregulation could be restored to a healthy, rather than diseased, phenotype,
we treated cell cultured neutrophils from T2D and healthy individuals with the small lipid ligand
resolution mediator RvE1. We observed that RvE1 dose-dependently modified both T2D and
healthy neutrophil gene expression in cell culture, suggesting a tendency for RvE1 treatment to
shift neutrophils toward a healthy phenotype. However, across treatment doses, only two genes
were significantly differentially expressed between T2D and healthy neutrophils: LILRB5 and
AKR1C1.
LILRB5 is an immune system gene that can bind major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I molecules on antigen-presenting cells, inhibiting stimulation of an immune
response (50). AKR1C1 catalyzes the reaction of progesterone to its inactive form but may also
regulate inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways (51), consistent with some altered cytokine
concentrations observed in this study. As LILRB5 and AKR1C1 remained significantly
differentially expressed regardless of RvE1 treatment dose, they may reflect molecular changes
in neutrophil inflammatory profiles.
In general, the genes differentially expressed between untreated T2D and healthy
neutrophils differed between the human serum and cell culture models. This may be due to in

vivo vs. ex vivo neutrophil differences, inter-individual variation in neutrophil responses, as not
all individuals whose neutrophils were cultured were also included in the baseline serum
neutrophil analysis, or they may represent different genes targeting similar pathways. Indeed,
when we investigated the top KEGG and GO pathways associated with differential gene
expression between T2D and healthy cell cultured neutrophils with a low (1nM) dose of RvE1,
the top pathways were primarily immune related, though there was less of a lipid pathway role
(data not shown).
Interestingly, three genes were differentially expressed in both neutrophil cell culture
without RvE1 treatment and the baseline serum analysis, including NECTIN2, HTRA3, and
ABCG1. Importantly, treatment of the T2D neutrophils in cell culture with 100nM of exogenous
RvE1 was able to reduce the level of differential expression of NECTIN2 and ABCG1,
suggesting a partial normalization of these neutrophils with RvE1 treatment.
We then used cytokine profiling to further interrogate the functional effect of RvE1
treatment on T2D and healthy neutrophils. We observed trends in different in cytokine profiles
between T2D and healthy neutrophils both with and without RvE1 treatment. In general, T2D
neutrophils tended to have a stronger response to RvE1 treatment, particularly at higher,
clinically relevant, RvE1 doses. Without any RvE1 treatment, we observed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines P-Selectin and TNF-α among T2D compared to healthy neutrophils,
though levels of pro-inflammatory MIP-1β, IL-8, and sICAM-1 cytokines were decreased in
T2D neutrophils. As cytokines have complex and often overlapping roles in pro- and antiinflammatory pathways, the relative contribution of each cytokine to neutrophil dysfunction in
T2D will require further investigation. We also observed differences in cytokine profiles by
subject, consistent with known inter-individual variation (52). Our study was limited by its small

sample size, which made more detailed subgroup analysis not feasible. However, even at this
sample size, this novel cell type has shown distinct differences in transcriptomic and functional
cytokine profiling between T2D and healthy individuals, including following RvE1 treatment,
indicating that larger follow-up studies are warranted. Importantly, our cytokine profiling
experiments showed that both T2D and healthy neutrophils were viable and capable of both
producing cytokines and responding to RvE1 treatment, demonstrating the importance of
concentration-based therapeutics for exogenous lipid ligands.
Key strengths of our study include the novel exploration of a biologically relevant cell
type (neutrophils) in chronic inflammatory diseases, investigations of both gene level
transcriptomics and pathway analyses, and the further exploration of the impact of a key
molecule in inflammation resolution (RvE1) on gene expression and functional cytokine levels.
Overall, we showed that neutrophils may act differently in individuals with chronic
inflammatory diseases, specifically diabetes, compared to healthy individuals (Figure 5). Further
validation of proteomic differences between diabetic and healthy individuals could elucidate
important inflammation mechanisms and potential pathways related to resolvin treatment effects,
including in subgroups of disease with clinically relevant diabetes comorbidities, such as those
with cardiovascular disease or periodontitis. Unraveling these mechanisms of neutrophil
dysregulation in chronic inflammatory diseases could ultimately elucidate inflammation and
resolution targets for better diagnostic and therapeutic treatment options.

Figure 1. Neutrophils from type 2 diabetic subjects show down-regulated expression of
inflammatory and lipid genes relative to healthy neutrophils. RNA-seq transcript expression
of T2D (N=11) vs. healthy (N=7) subject neutrophils. A) Volcano plot of ln-transformed gene
expression (x-axis) and the FDR-adjusted negative log-transformed p-value (y-axis). The dotted
lines represent selected significant differentially expressed gene thresholds: 0.6 for fold-change,
0.05 for significance. Blue and red indicate significantly down- and up-regulated genes,
respectively. B) Bean plots of the ln-transformed relative abundance of gene expression (line at
mean) of the top 3 most significant down-regulated genes and the one significant up-regulated
gene (GTSCR1) plotted for T2D vs. healthy individuals.

Figure 4. Type 2 diabetic and healthy neutrophils showed differential inflammatory
cytokine concentrations across resolvin E1 doses. Human inflammatory cytokine levels
(cytokines: MIP-1α, IL-4, IL-8, MIP-1β, P-Selectin, sICAM-1, TNF-α, IL-1α; average pg/mL) in
response to resolvin E1 (RvE1) dose, comparing T2D (N=3) to healthy (N=3) cultured
neutrophils with: A) vehicle only (0nM), B) 1nM, C) 10nM, or D) 100nM RvE1 treatment. For
each cytokine, values at or below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ; based on a 7-standard
curve at 1:4 dilution) were reported as the LLOQ value.
