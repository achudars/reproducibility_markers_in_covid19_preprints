Abstract
Background: ​Cross-sectional studies of various forms of dilated cardiomyopathy have noted a
truncating mutation in the gene encoding titin (‘TTNtv’) in 7-30% of patients, but the clinical
importance of identifying a TTNtv in an asymptomatic adult is largely unknown. In contrast to
cross-sectional studies, prospective cohort studies allow for unbiased estimates of the disease
risks associated with a genotype exposure.
Objectives: ​To determine the prevalence of cardiac imaging abnormalities and risk of incident
disease among middle-aged TTNtv carriers without known congestive heart failure.
Methods: ​We analyze exome sequencing data of 45,747 participants of the UK Biobank without
known congestive heart failure to identify TTNtv carriers. Among 10,552 with cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), we determine the relationship between TTNtv carrier status and left
ventricular ejection fraction. In this prospective cohort, we quantify the absolute and relative
risks of incident disease in TTNtv carriers versus noncarriers.
Results: ​Among 45,747 middle-aged participants without known congestive heart failure, 196
(0.43%) harbored a TTNtv. The average ejection fraction was 61% in TTNtv carriers versus 65%
in noncarriers (P = 1.8 ⨉ 10​-8​), with a 9.3-fold increase (95% CI 3.9 – 22.2) in odds of subnormal
ejection fraction (P = 5.7 ⨉ 10​-5​). Over a median follow-up of 6.9 years, a composite endpoint of
incident dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or all-cause mortality was observed in
6.6% of TTNtv carriers versus 2.9% of non-carriers (adjusted hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.4 – 4.3;
p = 1.1 ⨉ 10​-3​).
Conclusions: ​Approximately 1 in 230 middle-aged adults without known congestive heart
failure harbored a TTNtv. These carriers had a substantially increased relative risk—but modest
absolute risk—of having a subnormal ejection fraction or manifesting clinical disease during
prospective follow-up.

Condensed Abstract
Cross-sectional studies of dilated cardiomyopathy have noted a truncating mutation in the gene
encoding titin (‘TTNtv’) in up to 30% of patients—but the clinical importance of TTNtv in
asymptomatic adults is largely unknown. Here, we observe a TTNtv in 0.43% of 45,747
middle-aged adults. Average ejection fraction was 61% in TTNtv carriers versus 65% in
non-carriers (p<0.001). Over a median follow-up of 7 years, incident congestive heart failure or
mortality was observed in 6.6% of TTTtv carriers versus 2.9% of non-carriers (hazard ratio 2.5;
p = 0.001).

Text
Introduction
Truncating variants in the gene encoding titin (TTNtv) are the most commonly identified
mutations in patients presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)(1–4). In principle, gene
sequencing to identify asymptomatic individuals who harbor a TTNtv could enable early
diagnosis or preventive therapy. In practice, the clinical importance of identifying a TTNtv in an
asymptomatic individual with respect to relative and absolute risks of incident disease is largely
unknown.
A seminal paper in 2012 documented a TTNtv in ~20% of patients with DCM, a finding
subsequently replicated across a range of important forms of DCM—peripartum (15%),
alcohol-induced (14%), and chemotherapy related (8%)(1–4). As compared to controls, these
studies suggested a 5-10 fold increased odds of developing disease among TTNtv carriers.
Among individuals without clinically manifest disease, small prior studies have suggested a
modestly reduced ejection fraction among TTNtv carriers(5, 6). More recently, the increased
prevalence of TTNtv in patients with DCM was replicated in cross-sectional analyses from
biobanks of two large U.S. health systems(7).
Gene sequencing to identify individuals with important genetic variants at scale in the population
has become increasingly practical as the costs of sequencing have declined rapidly. At least
one U.S. healthcare system has already started returning TTNtv carriers status to patients within
routine clinical practice (Dewey et al., 2016), and a similar commitment has been embraced as a
core tenet of the All of Us Research Program, a National Institutes of Health sponsored program
that plans to enroll over one million participants in coming years(8).
Here, we determine the clinical importance of identifying a TTNtv among middle-aged adults of
the UK Biobank without known congestive heart failure. We first determined the relationship
between TTNtv carrier status and subclinical cardiac imaging abnormalities. Second, we
characterize the relative and absolute risks of incident congestive heart failure or all-cause
mortality in prospective follow-up.

Methods
Study participants
The UK Biobank is a richly phenotyped, prospective cohort of over 500,000 individuals (9).
Participants were enrolled between 2006-2010, and were aged 40-69 at the time of enrollment.
Analysis of cardiac MRI phenotypes was performed in all individuals with both genetic and
imaging data, after exclusion of participants with a cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease

diagnosis prior to the date of imaging. Incident event analyses were performed in all available
participants, after exclusion of those with a cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease
diagnosis prior to enrollment.
Analysis of the UK Biobank data was approved by the Partners HealthCare institutional review
board (protocol 2013P001840). Work was performed under UK Biobank application #7089.

Exome sequencing and ​TTN​ truncating variant classification

Whole exome sequencing was performed in 49,997 participants as previously described​(10,
11)​. 53 participants without genotyping array data were removed, leaving 49,944 exomes for
downstream analysis.
TTNtv variants were classified using the LOFTEE plug-in of the Ensembl Variant Effect
Predictors​(12, 13)​. This algorithm has been previously shown to reliably classify inactivating
variants: those that lead to a premature stop codon (nonsense), disrupt a canonical exon
splicing consensus sequence, or cause an inactivating frameshift. Unless otherwise noted, all
subsequent analyses were conducted using TTNtv in exons presents in cardiac-specific
transcripts with percent spliced in (PSI) in cardiac transcripts greater than 90% as previously
recommended​(5)​.

Phenotype definitions
Disease phenotypes in the UK Biobank were defined using a combination of self-reported data
(confirmed by a healthcare professional), and hospital admission diagnosis codes, and death
registry data. We defined DCM to be International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)
code I42.0, in the absence of a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), coronary artery bypass
grafting, or percutaneous coronary intervention as previously reported(14). Additional details are
provided in ​Supplemental Table 1 ​.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging measurements
Among the 45,747 individuals included in the main analysis, 10,784 had cardiac MRI data
available. These individuals were invited for imaging by the UK Biobank based on proximity to
imaging centers, without consideration of disease status. Cardiac MRI was performed with 1.5
Tesla machines (MAGNETOM Aera, Syngo Platform InlineVF version D13A, Siemens
Healthcare) with electrocardiographic gating for cardiac synchronization (15). Cardiac
assessment was performed from the combination of several cine series using balanced
steady-state free precession acquisitions (16). Automated readings were produced for left
ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV), and left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). LVEDV and LVESV were corrected with previously
established linear equations tailored to a UK population on the same imaging platform (17).

A cardiologist (JPP) reviewed the automated tracings from imaging studies belonging to
individuals with outlier measurements, defined as samples outside of 1.5 interquartile ranges
below the first or above the third quartile of LVEDV or LVESV (18). 232 automated
interpretations were deemed to be anatomically mistraced, leaving 10,552 individuals with
cardiac MRI data for analysis. In the remaining samples, LVEF below 54% for women or 52%
for men was considered to be subnormal (19).

Statistical analysis
To assess the association between TTNtv and prevalent disease, we applied a Firth
bias-corrected logistic regression model adjusted for sex and genetic ancestry as quantified by
the first five principal components, derived centrally by the UK Biobank as previously reported(9,
20). For assessing the association between TTNtv and subnormal LVEF, we applied Firth bias
corrected logistic regression adjusted for the cubic basis spline of age at enrollment (in order to
adjust for non-linear effects of age(21)), age at the time of MRI, sex, and the first five principal
components of ancestry.
Incident disease analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for
the cubic basis spline of age at the start of follow-up time, sex, and the first five principal
components of ancestry. Start of follow-up time was considered to be the date of enrollment
or—to prevent confounding introduced by ‘immortal time bias’(22)—the date of cardiac MRI for
those who underwent imaging. Additional details are available in the ​Supplementary Methods​.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.4.4 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria). Unadjusted comparison of baseline characteristics between TTNtv
carriers and noncarriers was performed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test for quantitative traits
and with the Fisher exact test for binary traits. Two-sided p-values were used unless otherwise
specified.

Results
TTNtv variant identification
49,997 participants had exome sequencing data, of whom 53 were excluded due to unavailable
genotyping array data needed for genetic ancestry assessment. In the remaining 49,944
individuals (before applying disease-based sample exclusion criteria), 308 distinct TTNtv
variants were identified across 669 carriers. Of these, 178 TTNtv variants were found in exons
highly expressed in the heart (percent spliced in > 90%, “high-PSI”), including 64 stop-gain
variants, 87 frameshifts, and 27 splice-site disrupting variants. These high-PSI variants were
present in a total of 227 individuals (0.45%) (​Figure 1​).

TTNtv were associated with prevalent CHF and DCM
To confirm prior case-control observations, we first assessed the relationship between high-PSI
TTNtv and prevalent disease in 227 high-PSI TTNtv carriers and 49,717 noncarriers. Four
TTNtv carriers had DCM at baseline compared to 22 noncarriers (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 51.5,
95% CI 19.0-139.6, P = 4.1 ⨉ 10​-7​). 10 TTNtv carriers had CHF, compared to 302 noncarriers
(OR 8.0, 95% CI 4.2-15.0, P = 7.7 ⨉ 10​-7​). As expected, the presence of a TTNtv in an exon not
highly expressed in the heart (PSI < 90%) was not significantly associated with prevalent
disease among 421 carriers (P = 0.58 for DCM; P = 0.61 for CHF).

Participant baseline characteristics for incident disease analysis
For subsequent analyses, we excluded participants with CHF, DCM, or CAD at baseline (​Figure
2​), after which 45,747 participants remained. Of these, 196 (0.43%) had a high PSI TTNtv.
Baseline characteristics were similar between participants with and without TTNtv (​Table 1​ and
Supplementary Table 2​).

TTNtv were linked to subclinical changes in cardiac structure and function
We next examined the relationship between TTNtv and subclinical cardiac MRI abnormalities in
10,552 without known CAD, DCM, or CHF at time of imaging. Of these participants, 47 (0.45%)
carried a TTNtv. Importantly, the UK Biobank invited individuals to undergo imaging without
consideration of disease status, thus minimizing potential biases introduced by imaging ordered
as part of routine clinical care.
Mean LVEF was 61.1% in TTNtv carriers versus 64.9% in noncarriers (adjusted difference
-4.3%; 95% CI -2.8% – -5.8%; P = 1.8 ⨉ 10​-8​). Significantly more TTNtv carriers had a
subnormal LVEF, defined as being below 52% for men or 54% for women (19), compared to
noncarriers (13% vs 2.1%; ​Figure 3​). In an adjusted logistic regression model, the presence of
a TTNtv yielded an OR of 9.3 (CI 3.9-22.2; P = 5.7 ⨉ 10​-5​) for a subnormal ejection fraction.
Beyond LVEF, TTNtv carriers had no significant difference in LV end-diastolic volume but did
have a significantly increased LV end-systolic volume (adjusted difference 8.7mL; 95% CI
4.9-12.4; P = 6.6 ⨉ 10​-6​), consistent with impaired contractility among TTNtv carriers.

TTNtv were associated with incident morbidity and mortality
Among 45,747 individuals without clinically diagnosed CHF or coronary artery disease at
baseline, we next determined relative and absolute risk of incident DCM, CHF, or all-cause
mortality over a median follow-up of 6.9 years (25th-75th% 6.3-7.1 years). The composite
endpoint of a physician diagnosis code for DCM, CHF, or mortality occurred in 13 of 196 (6.6%)
TTNtv carriers and 1,329 of 45,551 (2.9%) of noncarriers—corresponding to an adjusted hazard
ratio (HR) of 2.5 (95% CI 1.4-4.3; P = 1.1 ⨉ 10​-3​). The increased HR for the composite outcome

in TTNtv carriers was not attenuated by adjusting for additional clinical risk factors at baseline,
including alcohol consumption, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and BMI (adjusted HR
2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.4, P = 8.9 ⨉ 10​-4​).
With respect to individual components of the composite endpoint, 3 out of 196 TTNtv carriers
developed incident DCM, compared to 23 of 45,551 noncarriers (adjusted HR 31.7, 95% CI
9.5-106.5; P=2.2 ⨉ 10​-8​). 5 of 196 TTNtv carriers developed CHF, compared to 277 of 45,551
noncarriers (adjusted HR 4.1; 95% CI 1.7-9.8; P=1.9 ⨉ 10​-3​). 9 of 196 carriers died, compared to
1,115 of 45,551 noncarriers (adjusted HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0-3.7; P=0.052; ​Supplementary
Figure 1​). The increased risk of mortality for TTNtv carriers was not attenuated by adjusting for
additional clinical risk factors at baseline, including alcohol consumption, smoking status,
hypertension, diabetes, and BMI (adjusted HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.7, P=0.047).
Similar patterns were observed in an analysis that quantified 5-year risk of each of the
endpoints (​Figure 4​).

Discussion
A primary goal of genomic medicine is to identify asymptomatic individuals who are nonetheless
high-risk based on genetic variants, with the aim of facilitating targeted screening or prevention
efforts. This paradigm is a significant departure from the traditional approach, where gene
sequencing has been largely restricted to those already afflicted with disease and their family
members. Here, we observe a TTNtv in 1 in ~230 middle-aged adult participants without known
cardiovascular disease. On average, TTNtv carriers had subtly lower LVEF (61% vs 65%, p=1.8
⨉ 10​-8​) and were 9-fold more likely to have subnormal LVEF. During a median follow-up period
of 6.9 years, TTNtv carriers had a high relative risk of developing DCM, CHF, or death (HR 2.5,
95% CI 1.7-3.6), but a modest absolute risk (6.6% among carriers vs 2.9% among noncarriers).
The results of these analyses support three key conclusions. First, beyond confirming a known
association of TTNtv variants with prevalent cardiomyopathy and CHF (2, 3, 5, 7, 23–28), we
provide new evidence for a substantially increased risk of incident DCM, CHF, and all-cause
mortality. This prospective assessment is particularly important in helping to overcome concerns
about ascertainment biases that may be present in prior seminal case-control studies.
Second, despite a substantially increased relative risk noted in TTNtv carriers, the absolute risk
of an abnormal ejection fraction and incident CHF remains modest. For example, 87% of the
TTNtv carriers who underwent cardiac imaging in our study had a normal ejection fraction and
97% remained free of a new clinical diagnosis of CHF after a median follow-up of 6.9 years.
These results are consistent with TTNtv serving as an important risk factor for cardiomyopathy,
rather than mapping with disease in a 1:1 deterministic fashion. Work from prior studies
suggests that superimposed clinical or environmental stressors—pregnancy, alcohol, or
chemotherapy—may unmask overt cardiomyopathy among those genetically predisposed by a

TTNtv(1–4). Additional efforts are needed to better understand the genetic and nongenetic
determinants governing which TTNtv carriers are most likely to manifest clinical disease.
Third, ​TTN​ may warrant inclusion in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics
list of genes in which pathogenic mutations are both important and actionable (29). Although the
management of asymptomatic TTNtv carriers lacks a strong evidence base, potential clinical
considerations include serial imaging to detect subclinical structural abnormalities, avoidance of
excess alcohol, intensive blood pressure control, increased surveillance or dose-reduction of
cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens, and ‘cascade screening’ to assess carrier status in
first-degree relatives (30). At least one U.S. health system has already started disclosing TTNtv
variant status to patients and their health care providers (31); this experience is likely to provide
further insights into the clinical utility, as well as potential adverse psychosocial or cost
implications of this approach.
These results are best interpreted in the context of four key limitations. First, the detection of
prevalent and incident CHF-related outcomes was based on verbal interviews with healthcare
staff from the UK Biobank and hospital admission diagnosis codes—as such, there may be
inaccuracies in clinical event adjudication. Second, UK Biobank participants were recruited at
age 40-69 years, raising the possibility of survivorship or selection biases, which limits the
generalizability of our results to younger or elderly patients. Third, cardiac MRI data were
available in a subset of the participants and at one point in time for each participant; analyses of
serial cardiac imaging studies would be informative to model trajectories in cardiac function over
time. Fourth, >90% of the participants in our study were of European ancestry, limiting the ability
to assess for effect heterogeneity across other ancestral groups, as was suggested in a recent
analysis of black patients of U.S. health care systems (7).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we identified TTNtv variants in 0.43% of individuals without known congestive
heart failure. These individuals had subtle, subnormal reductions in LV systolic function and
were at substantially increased relative risk—but modest absolute risk—of developing incident
dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or all-cause mortality.

Figures
Figure 1: ​TTN​ truncating variants

Domains of TTN, including the Z-disk, the I-band, the A-band, and the M-band, are colored and
labeled. The distance along the TTN transcript is demarcated on the x-axis. Each exon is scaled
on the y-axis based on its PSI value, reflecting the percentage of ​TTN​ transcripts found in the
heart that incorporate the exon (5). Each hash mark represents one individual with a TTNtv,
based on the location of that truncation; the top row of hash marks represents individuals who
developed incident congestive heart failure; the second, those who developed incident dilated
cardiomyopathy; the third, those with a reduced LVEF; and the fourth, all other individuals with a
TTNtv. Individuals with TTNtv in any exon, including those with PSI < 90%, are represented.

Figure 3: Impact of TTNtv carrier status on left ventricular ejection fraction

In Panel ​A​, the proportion of the population with a subnormal LVEF is shown, stratified into
TTNtv carriers and noncarriers. Men with LVEF below 0.52 and women with LVEF below 0.54
were considered to have a subnormal LVEF. The presence of a TTNtv was associated with
increased odds of having a subnormal LVEF (OR 9.3; P = 5.7 ⨉ 10​-5​) in a logistic model
adjusted for the cubic basis spline of age, sex, and the first five principal components of
ancestry. In Panel ​B​, the distribution of LVEF is shown in TTNtv carriers versus noncarriers.
Mean LVEF was 61.1% in TTNtv carriers versus 64.9% in noncarriers, corresponding to a -4.3%
adjusted difference (P = 1.8 ⨉ 10​-8​) in a linear model accounting for the cubic basis spline of
age, sex, and the first five principal components of ancestry.

The percentages reflect the incident event curve modeled at 5 years for the development of
DCM, CHF, death, or the composite outcome (DCM, CHF, or death), stratified according to
TTNtv carrier status.
