ABSTRACT (250 words)
Objective: Germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes
and the base excision repair genes NTHL1 and MUTYH underlie hereditary CRC and
polyposis syndromes. We evaluate the robustness and discriminatory potential of tumour
mutational signatures in colorectal cancers (CRCs) for identifying germline PV carriers.
Design: Whole exome sequencing of FFPE CRC tissue was performed on hereditary CRC
PV carriers (14 MMR, 6 biallelic MUTYH, and 1 biallelic NTHL1), 9 sporadic MMRdeficient CRCs (MMRd controls) and 18 sporadic MMR-proficient CRCs (MMRp controls).
COSMIC V3 Single Base Substitution (SBS) and Indel (ID) mutational signatures were
calculated and assessed for their ability to differentiate CRCs that developed in carriers and
non-carriers.
Results: The combination of SBS18 and SBS36 contributing >23% of the signature profile
was able to discriminate biallelic MUTYH carriers from MMRp and MMRd control CRCs
with >99% confidence. Variant specific signatures SBS18 and SBS36 were identified for
MUTYH p.Gly396Asp (p=0.015) and MUTYH p.Tyr179Cys (p=0.0012), respectively.
SBS30 was significantly increased in a CRC from a biallelic NTHL1 carrier compared with
MMRp and MMRd control CRCs. The combination of ID2, ID7, SBS15 and SBS1 could
discriminate the 14 MMR PV carrier CRCs from the MMRp control CRCs, however, SBS
and ID signatures, alone or in combination, could not provide complete discrimination
between CRCs from MMR PV carriers and sporadic MMRd controls.
Conclusion: Assessment of SBS and ID signatures can discriminate CRCs from MUTYH,
NTHL1 and MMR PV carriers from non-carriers, demonstrating utility as a potential
diagnostic and variant classification tool.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
What is already known about this subject?
•

Identifying carriers of pathogenic variants (PVs) in moderate/high-risk CRC and
polyposis susceptibility genes has clinical relevance for diagnosis, targeted screening
and prevention strategies, prognosis, and treatment options, however, challenges still
remain in the identification of carriers and the classification of rare variants in these
genes.

•

Previous studies have identified tumour mutational signatures that result from
defective DNA repair including DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and base
excision repair defects, DNA repair mechanisms that underlie the common hereditary
CRC and polyposis syndromes.

What are the new findings?
•

Single base substitution (SBS)-related mutational signatures derived from whole
exome sequencing of FFPE-derived CRC tissue DNA could effectively discriminate
CRCs that developed in biallelic MUTYH PV carriers and biallelic NTHL1 PV
carriers from CRC-affected non-carriers.

•

CRCs that developed in MMR PV carriers (Lynch syndrome) could be effectively
differentiated from sporadic MMR-proficient CRC by a combination of SBS and
indel (ID) signatures, but they were less effective at discriminating Lynch syndromerelated CRC from sporadic MMR-deficient CRC resulting from MLH1 gene promoter
hypermethylation.

•

The SBS and ID mutational signatures associated with hereditary CRC and polyposis
syndrome carriers were robust to changes in experimental settings.

•

We demonstrate the optimal variant filtering settings for calculating mutational
signatures and define stringent thresholds for classifying CRC aetiology as hereditary
or non-hereditary.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
•

Deriving SBS- and ID-related mutational signatures from CRCs can identify carriers
of PVs in hereditary CRC and polyposis susceptibility genes.

•

The application of mutational signatures will improve the diagnosis of syndromic
CRC and aid in variant classification, leading to improved clinical management and
CRC prevention.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is a
leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality [1]. Currently, 5-10% of CRCs
develop in individuals who carry a pathogenic variant (PV) in a known hereditary CRC
and/or polyposis susceptibility gene, including the mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) and the base excision repair (BER) genes MUTYH [2] and NTHL1 [3]
(reviewed in [4]). Identifying carriers of PVs in these susceptibility genes has important
implications for preventing subsequent primary cancers in the proband [5–7] and for the
prevention of CRC in relatives through targeted screening approaches such as colonoscopy
with polypectomy [8,9].

Currently, the most common strategy to identify MMR gene PV carriers (Lynch syndrome)
starts with testing the tumour for microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of MMR protein
expression by immunohistochemistry [10,11]. However, loss of MMR protein expression
(MMR-deficiency) in a CRC is not diagnostic for carrying a PV because MMR-deficiency
can be caused by epigenetic inactivation of the MMR genes (hypermethylation of the MLH1
gene promoter) or biallelic somatic mutations of MMR genes [12,13]. Moreover, no tumourbased approach is routinely applied to identify biallelic PV carriers in the MUTYH or NTHL1
genes; currently germline testing is guided by the presence of associated phenotypic features
[4]. Consequently, the classification of rare variants and variants of uncertain clinical
significance (VUS) still present challenges [14].

The determination of tumour mutational signatures is an emerging approach that integrates
the somatic mutation landscape within a single tumour to identify patterns associated with
distinct oncogenic pathways [15–18]. Each signature is derived from compositional changes
of single base substitutions (SBS), indels (ID), and doublets. The most recent version of the
predominant mutational signature framework published on the COSMIC website defines 95
signatures, of which a proposed aetiology is available for 63 (66%) signatures [19]. To date,
seven signatures have been identified that relate to defective DNA repair including MMR
(SBS6, SBS15, SBS20, SBS26), and BER defects caused by dysfunctional NTHL1
(SBS30)[7] and MUTYH (SBS18 and SBS36) [20,21]. Therefore, determining signatures

presents a promising new strategy to identify PV carriers and to improve the current
classification of rare variants and VUS.

Although mutational signatures show substantial promise in the translational setting, clinical
adoption has been limited [22]. One impediment is that the performance of signatures for
clinical outcome and therapeutic response prediction is largely unknown. Given an observed
profile of signatures, it is challenging to quantitatively assess the likelihood of an underlying
mutational process being present in the tested sample. In addition, the relationship between
signatures and experimental factors such as the tissue preparation method (formalin-fixed or
fresh), variant calling and filtering strategy (stringent or lenient), and breadth of genome
coverage (genome or exome or targeted panels) is not well characterised. Highlighting this
issue, an assessment of the impact of signature calculation method and minor perturbations to
reported variants suggested substantial variation in stability between signatures [23].
Consequently, the clinical suitability of any specific signature, underlying mutational process,
or experimental setting is currently unknown.

In this study, we evaluated the SBS and ID signature landscapes in CRCs caused by germline
PVs in the MMR genes or by biallelic or monoallelic PVs in the MUTYH and NTHL1 genes,
to test the clinical utility of mutational signatures for predicting PVs in specific genes. We
assessed the effect of experimental settings and quantified the discriminatory potential of
signatures for identifying PV carriers from non-syndromic CRC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Cohort
CRC-affected individuals recruited to the Genetics of Colonic Polyposis Study (GCPS) [24]
or the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) [25,26] were selected for
analysis in this study if they were carriers of germline PVs in MLH1, MSH2 or MSH6 or were
biallelic or monoallelic carriers of PVs in the MUTYH or NTHL1 genes. A single CRCaffected individual carrying a PV and a VUS in the MUTYH gene was also included (sample
M12). Details of germline and tumour characterisation used to identify variant carriers has
been described previously [7,27,28]. Two groups of CRC-affected individuals from the

ACCFR [28] were included as non-syndromic controls: 1) individuals who developed MMRproficient (MMRp) CRC without a known germline mutation in a hereditary CRC/polyposis
associated gene were included as “MMRp controls” (n=18), and 2) individuals who
developed MMRd CRC resulting from somatic MLH1 gene promoter hypermethylation were
included as “MMRd controls” (n=9), described in [28]. In total, 60 CRC tumours from 56
individuals were included in this study (Supplementary Table 1).

Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Analysis
Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) CRC tissues were macrodissected and sequenced
as tumour with matching peripheral blood-derived DNA sequenced as germline
(Supplementary Methods). Mean on-target coverage was 431.8 ± 88.3 (mean ± SD) for
FFPE tumour DNA samples and 158.7 ± 89.6 for blood-derived DNA samples. Somatic
single-nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions (indels) were called with Strelka
2.9.2 (recommended workflow) and used to calculate mutational signatures using the method
described by DeconstructSigs [29] from the set of COSMIC version 3 signatures [19]
(Supplementary Methods). The impact of experimental settings was explored by filtering
variants based on depth of coverage (DP) and the variant allele fraction (VAF) in the tumour,
then calculating signatures at each filter point.

We assessed the ability of signatures to separate the specific syndromic CRC group from the
non-syndromic CRC group using four methods, at each filtering setting, for each relevant
signature: 1) Fisher’s discriminant [30], which measures the ratio of between-group
variability and within-group variability to find filtering settings that produce tightly clustered
groups that are well-separated, 2) absolute margin separating the specific syndromic CRC
group from non-syndromic groups, 3) the difference in the means of the two groups, and 4)
P-values were calculated using a one-sided t-test, or for groups with a single sample (N01),
we applied Grubbs outlier test [31] to evaluate separability (Supplementary Methods).

We fitted the signatures of each group of CRCs to a beta distribution to enable the generation
of percentiles for each group. Confidence thresholds that a given measurement belonged to
the hereditary CRC syndrome of interest were also calculated. To find the best combination
of signatures for identifying each hereditary syndrome, we applied forward selection while

maximising the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve (ROC) and the
margin between the groups, with stringent requirements to reduce the likelihood of
overfitting (Supplementary Methods).

RESULTS
Overall Tumour Mutational Signature Results
The 60 CRCs analysed in this study were classified as syndromic CRCs (n=33) and nonsyndromic CRC controls (n=27), comprising of 9 MMRd CRCs (mean age at diagnosis±SD
56.8±7.3 years), and 18 MMRp CRCs (44.1±12.4 years) (Table 1). The characteristics of

Figure 1 illustrates the calculated SBS and ID signature compositions for each of the 60
CRCs. The SBS-derived signatures that have been previously reported to be associated with
BER defects were observed as the dominant signature in 9 out of 10 biallelic MUTYH related
CRCs (SBS18 and SBS36) and for the single biallelic NTHL1 related CRC (SBS30) (Figure
1). SBS6, SBS15, ID2 and ID7 were the dominant signatures in MMRd CRCs from both
Lynch syndrome and MLH1 methylated tumours (MMRd controls). The signatures observed
for each CRC, their proportion and ranking are provided in Supplementary Table 2. The
signatures associated with hereditary CRC syndromes are shown in Figure 2.

Identifying a biallelic MUTYH carrier mutational signature in CRC
For biallelic MUTYH carrier CRCs, only two signatures were significantly enriched when
compared with non-MUTYH CRCs. The mean±SD of SBS18 and SBS36 were each
significantly higher in the CRCs from biallelic MUTYH carriers (M01-M10) compared with
the non-MUTYH CRCs (20.6±15.1% v. 0.6±1.7%; p=6x10-12 and 25.5±15.6% v. 0.1±0.3%;
p=2x10-15, respectively; Figure 2). For the CRCs from the monoallelic MUTYH carriers
(M11, M13 and M14), the mean±SD of SBS18 and SBS36 were not significantly enriched
when compared with the non-MUTYH CRCs (0.0±0.0% v. 0.6±1.7%; p=1.0 and 0.0±0.0% v.
0.1±0.3%; p=1.0, respectively; Figure 2).

We investigated whether SBS18 and SBS36 differed by the underlying germline MUTYH
mutation. The CRCs from homozygous or compound heterozygous carriers of the c.536A>G
p.Tyr179Cys PV (n=7) showed significantly higher proportions of SBS36 (p=0.0012), while
the CRCs from homozygous carriers of the c.1187G>A p.Gly396Asp variant (n=3) showed
significantly higher proportions of SBS18 (p=0.015) (Figure 3a and Figure 3b). Tumour
mutational burden (TMB) was also found to be significantly higher (p=0.0054) in
homozygous or compound heterozygous carriers of the c.536A>G p.Tyr179Cys (15.22±3.65
mutations/Mb) relative to p.Gly396Asp homozygous carriers (6.30±0.52 mutations/Mb).

We investigated the ability of mutational signatures to differentiate CRCs from MUTYH
carriers from non-carriers. The combination of SBS18 and SBS36 provided the most
effective discrimination of CRCs from biallelic MUTYH carriers from all other CRCs in the
study, achieving an AUC of 1.00, and separation of 9.0 percentage points (pp) between the

two groups (Table 2). The sum of SBS18 and SBS36 accounted for, on average, almost half
of the total signature composition for biallelic MUTYH related CRCs (46.1±12.3%; range
18.2% to 57.0%) whereas these signatures had negligible contribution to all other CRCs in
the study (0.6±1.8%; range 0.0% to 9.2%).

We found that the robustness of mutational signatures is dependent on different minimum
VAF and minimum DP variant filtering settings. A minimum VAF threshold between 0.05
and 0.20 (Figure 4a and Figure 4b), and a minimum DP threshold of at least 30 (Figure 4c
and Figure 4d) effectively separated biallelic MUTYH carrier and non-MUTYH carrier CRC
groups. A minimum VAF of 0.1 and minimum DP of 50 were selected to maximise the
capacity of signatures to identify CRCs from biallelic MUTYH carriers. Our analysis showed
that a CRC with a combined SBS18 and SBS36 proportion of >23% or <9% has a >99% or
<1% likelihood, respectively, of having a biallelic defect in MUTYH (Figure 4c and Figure
4d).

We applied these thresholds in two scenarios: 1) evaluating monoallelic carriers, and 2)
classifying a VUS. The sum of SBS18 and SBS36 was evaluated in three CRCs from three
monoallelic MUTYH PV carriers (M11, M13 and M14): both SBS18 and SBS36 were 0% for
each of the three CRCs, suggesting that monoallelic MUTYH PVs are not related to defective
BER. No identifiable second somatic “hit” (single nucleotide variant or loss of
heterozygosity) in MUTYH was evident in any of the three CRCs (Supplementary Figure
2). We then calculated the combined SBS18 and SBS36 signatures for a CRC (M12) from a
person who carried a heterozygous MUTYH c.1187G>A p.Gly396Asp PV and a
heterozygous MUTYH c.912C>G p.Ser304Arg VUS [32]. The sum of SBS18 and SBS36 was
0.3%, (Figure 4c and Figure 4d) and therefore, according to our analysis of confirmed
biallelic MUTYH variants, there is a <1% likelihood that this CRC has biallelic MUTYH
inactivation. This further suggests that the c.912C>G p.Ser304Arg variant is not likely to be
pathogenic or is in cis with the c.1187G>A p.Gly396Asp PV.

Identifying a biallelic NTHL1 carrier mutational signature in CRC
The value of SBS30 was significantly higher in the CRC from the biallelic NTHL1 carrier
(N01) compared with the rest of the non-NTHL1 CRCs (46.5% v. 0.4±1.4%; p=3x10-230) but

was not significantly different in the CRCs from the monoallelic NTHL1 carriers (N02, N03,
N04 and N05) when compared with the rest of the non-NTHL1 CRCs (0.0±0.0% v.
0.4±1.4%; p=1; Figure 2). SBS23 and SBS42 were also significantly higher in the biallelic
NTHL1 CRC compared with the rest of the CRCs (p=7x10-204 and p=2x10-12, respectively;
Figure 2). Forward selection identified SBS30 as the most effective mutational signature to
discriminate the CRC from the biallelic NTHL1 carrier from all other CRCs in the study,
achieving an AUC of 1.00, and a separation of 38.0% from the rest of the CRCs, compared to
a separation of 6.1% and 1.6% for SBS23 and SBS42, respectively (Table 2).

Variant filtering settings were less critical for identifying the NTHL1 carrier N01 (Figure 5a
and Figure 5b), with SBS30 exhibiting discriminatory power at VAF thresholds between
0.05 and 0.375, and all measured DP thresholds. Using a VAF threshold of 0.1 and DP filter
of 50, our analysis indicates that a CRC with a measured SBS30 value of >41% confers a
likelihood of >99% that the tumour has a biallelic NTHL1 defect. Similarly, if SBS30 is
<38%, a biallelic NTHL1 defect is <1% likely (Figure 5c and Figure 5d). The CRCs from
the four monoallelic NTHL1 PV carriers (N02, N03, N04 and N05) all exhibited an SBS30
value of 0%, suggesting these CRCs do not have defective BER related to NTHL1. No
identifiable second somatic “hit” (single nucleotide variant or loss of heterozygosity) in
NTHL1 was evident in these four CRCs (Supplementary Figure 2).

Identifying a MMR gene (Lynch syndrome) carrier mutational signature in CRC
We investigated the utility of previously reported signatures for identifying Lynch syndromerelated CRCs compared to MMRp CRCs and sporadic MMRd CRCs. The Lynch syndromerelated CRCs (L01-L14) showed significantly higher levels of SBS1, SBS15, SBS20, SBS21,
ID2 and ID7 (p=5x10-6, p=1x10-7, p=1x10-8, p=8x10-10, p=7x10-16, p=9x10-10 respectively)
compared with the MMRp CRCs (Figure 2). SBS6 was seen at high levels in the Lynch
syndrome CRCs (17.8% ± 8.4%) but was not considered significantly different when
compared with MMRp CRCs (8.4±7.7%) after adjusting the significance threshold for
multiple comparisons (p=0.0002). Although SBS14, SBS26 and SBS44 have been associated
with defective MMR, we found no association with Lynch syndrome-related CRC when
compared with MMRp CRCs. When comparing Lynch syndrome-related CRCs (L01-L14)
to the MMRd control group of CRCs (K01-K09), SBS1 showed the most significant

difference between the groups (26.3±8.7% v. 15.8±9.8%, p=0.009), however neither SBS1
nor any other signature were significantly different after adjustment for multiple comparisons
(Figure 2).

When comparing the CRCs from MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 PV carriers, no significant genespecific difference in mutational signatures was found after multiple comparison adjustment
(Figure 3c and Figure 3d).

Signatures of interest were found to be consistent at VAF thresholds between 0.00 and 0.15,
and DP thresholds between 10 and 150 (Figure 6, 7, Supplementary Figure 1).

To first investigate a common molecular stratification in CRC, we applied forward selection
to discriminate MMRd CRC (L01-L14 and K01-K09 CRCs) from all MMRp CRCs (C01C18, M01-M14, N01-N05) in this study. This identified ID2, ID7, and SBS15 as the most
informative combination of signatures, achieving an AUC of 1.00, and separation of 4.1pp
between the groups (Table 2). We then applied forward selection to discriminate Lynch
syndrome-related CRCs (L01-L14) from all MMRp CRCs in this study, identifying ID2, ID7,
SBS1, and SBS15 as the most informative combination of signatures, achieving an AUC of
1.00, and separation of 33.2pp between the groups (Table 2). When considering the sum of
ID2, ID7, SBS1 and SBS15, the likelihood of a Lynch syndrome-related CRC relative to a
MMRp CRC is >99% and <1% at values of >105% and <76% (Figure 7a and Figure 7b).

A common diagnostic challenge for MMRd CRC is to differentiate inherited (Lynch
syndrome) from sporadic MMRd CRC. Forward selection showed no significant (adjusted P
< 0.05) mutational signature. SBS1 was the best performing signature that could
discriminate Lynch syndrome-related CRCs (L01-L14) from the MMRd control CRCs (K01K09) in this study. However, SBS1 only achieved an AUC of 0.76 and the groups overlap by
23% (Table 2). Consequently, the Lynch syndrome and sporadic MMRd CRCs could not be
separated with high confidence (Figure 7c and Figure 7d).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we compared mutational signature profiles in CRCs from carriers of PVs in
CRC and polyposis susceptibility genes with those in CRCs from individuals who did not
carry a PV in one of these genes. Germline PVs in the DNA MMR genes and biallelic PVs
in the MUTYH and NTHL1 genes result in a high risk of developing CRC and other extracolonic cancers [8,9,33], highlighting the importance of identifying carriers [3,7]. Our
analysis identified multiple SBS and/or ID signatures that were associated with each
syndromic CRC, supporting germline inactivation of the DNA MMR and BER pathways as
key drivers of CRC tumourigenesis. The sum of SBS18 and SBS36 provided the most
effective combination to differentiate CRCs from biallelic MUTYH carriers from CRCs from
non-carriers. The CRC from a biallelic NTHL1 carrier demonstrated significantly increased
proportions of SBS23, SBS30 and SBS42 compared with CRCs from non-carriers, however,
the presence of SBS30 at >41% was sufficient to provide >99% likelihood that a CRC had
developed in a person with biallelic inactivation of the NTHL1 gene. These findings support

previous observations of the significance of SBS30 in biallelic NTHL1 deficient tumours
[3,7,34]. CRCs that developed in MMR PV carriers (Lynch syndrome) could be effectively
differentiated from sporadic MMR-proficient CRC by a combination of signatures (ID2, ID7,
SBS1 and SBS15), but signatures were less effective at discriminating Lynch syndromerelated CRC from sporadic MMR-deficient CRC resulting from MLH1 gene promoter
hypermethylation (SBS1: AUC=76%). These findings support the utility of deriving
mutational signatures from CRCs to identify carriers of PVs in MMR, MUTYH and NTHL1
genes.

SBS18 and SBS36 were individually associated with CRCs from biallelic MUTYH carriers in
our cohort, but neither signature alone completely separated the carriers from the nonMUTYH CRCs. Combining SBS18 and SBS36 resulted in a 9.0pp separation from the nonMUTYH carrier CRCs. This was also observed for the Lynch syndrome-related CRCs where
the combination of ID2, ID7, SBS15 and SBS1 resulted in a 33.2pp separation from the
MMRp CRCs, while each individually associated signature alone overlapped with the MMRp
CRCs, highlighting the benefit of combining signatures for improved discrimination.

This study confirms previous reports of the association of SBS18 and SBS36 with CRCs
from biallelic MUTYH carriers [20,21]. In addition, we observed significant differences
between individual signatures and the underlying germline MUTYH PV. TMB in CRCs from
p.Tyr179Cys carriers was also significantly elevated relative to the MMRp controls
(p=0.019), suggesting that the underlying germline mutation may have implications for
immunotherapy-based treatment of CRC in these carriers. The reason for the observed
differences by specific mutation is not yet known but it is possible that disruption of different
functional domains (p.Tyr179Cys: N-terminal domain; p.Gly396Asp: C-terminal domain)
may result in different somatic mutations and mutational spectrum. It remains to be
determined if the signature composition will differ for carriers of MUTYH PVs other than the
two common European PVs.

Monoallelic MUTYH PV carriers are reported to have an increased risk of CRC [27,35]. A
previous study identified high levels of SBS18 in the CRCs from two monoallelic germline
MUTYH PV carriers where loss of the wildtype allele was observed in the tumour [20]. In

this study, SBS18 and/or SBS36 were not increased in the CRCs from the three monoallelic
MUTYH carriers, nor did we find evidence of a second somatic hit in their CRCs. In
addition, none of the CRCs from four monoallelic NTHL1 PV carriers exhibited SBS30. Our
findings support the notion that biallelic MUTYH or NTHL1 inactivation is necessary to
promote BER deficiency-related CRC tumourigenesis. This approach could be applied to
rare variant classification, including VUSs. We explored this in a CRC (M12) from a carrier
of a MUTYH PV (p.Gly396Asp) and a VUS (p.Ser304Arg). The absence of both SBS18 and
SBS36 suggests that this VUS is not pathogenic and this is further supported by exclusion of
the variant being in cis with the p.Gly396Asp PV through parent genotyping.

The current proposed mechanism for the accumulation of MMRd associated somatic
mutations is based on polymerase slippage, particularly during replication of low complexity
regions such as homopolymers, followed by defective repair of these errors [36]. The result
is MSI, a phenomenon associated with Lynch syndrome. Our results reflect this underlying
molecular mechanism, showing that ID signatures more effectively identify MMRd samples
compared to SBS signatures. The most relevant signatures, ID2 and ID7, are primarily
composed of 1bp homopolymer deletions, which corresponds to the expected aetiology. We
demonstrated that mutational signatures were able to differentiate MMRd CRC from MMRp
CRC, a feat that is currently achieved by MMR immunohistochemistry and is recommended
to be performed on all newly diagnosed CRCs to screen for Lynch syndrome-associated CRC
[10]. As tumour sequencing becomes more widely implemented, calculating signatures on
CRCs could supersede the need for MMR immunohistochemistry. When comparing Lynch
syndrome MMRd CRCs (L01-L14) to the CRCs from the MMRd control group (K01-K09),
SBS1 had the greatest capacity to separate the two groups, but was not significant after
adjusting for multiple comparisons (AUC 76%; p=0.009). From our analysis we find that the
current mutational signature framework cannot completely differentiate Lynch syndrome
CRCs from MLH1 methylated CRCs. One possible reason for this is that the molecular
effect of MLH1 deactivation via DNA PVs is indistinguishable from that resulting from
epigenetic silencing of MLH1.

We assessed the robustness of mutational signatures to changes in variant filtering settings.
Our results demonstrated that if filtering VAF and DP too leniently (increased artefacts) or

too stringently (reduced number of variants) resulted in substantial changes to the signature
proportions, including loss of the hereditary CRC-associated signatures in the CRC. In our
study, a minimum VAF threshold from 0.05 to 0.2, and minimum DP threshold from 25 to
100 resulted in stable somatic mutation counts and consequently increased robustness of the
hereditary CRC-associated signatures. To overcome a potential limitation of selecting a set
of fixed optimal filtering settings we generated progression graphs that illustrate the
robustness of a tumour’s signature profile across different filtering settings (Figure 4a, 4b,
5a, 5b, 6a-f), providing a visual confirmation of a single tumour’s signature robustness when
compared to presenting a tumour’s profile as a “mutograph” (Figure 1). Although this
approach demands increased computational requirements, this may resolve ambiguous cases,
and reduces the likelihood of artefacts arising due to signature calculation at a single,
potentially arbitrary, filtering threshold.

This study has some limitations. Only a single biallelic NTHL1 carrier was included in the
study. This CRC showed relatively high levels of SBS23, SBS30 and SBS42. SBS30 and
SBS23 were previously identified in tumours from biallelic NTHL1 carriers adding support to
our findings [7]. SBS42 was not identified previously in this context as it was not part of the
previous version of signatures and therefore could not be reported. Doublet signatures were
excluded from this study due to low numbers in WES data, and high reconstruction error.
This study used pre-existing COSMIC signature definitions from which to generate
mutational signatures for each CRC, rather than creating novel signatures specific for our
cohort. The advantage of this approach is the existing associated phenotypes provided for the
COSMIC definitions, but unrelated signatures are included in the calculation, which may
result in reporting spurious signatures. Analysis of an independent set of syndromic and nonsyndromic CRCs is needed to validate our findings.

CONCLUSIONS
Understanding the somatic mutational landscape can enhance precision oncology by enabling
us to pinpoint biomarkers relevant to targeted treatment [37]. As access to tumour sequencing
increases, the opportunity to derive mutational signatures, at minimal cost, can provide
improved diagnostic yield and guide therapeutic options [22]. We have shown that CRCs
from biallelic MUTYH carriers and from biallelic NTHL1 carriers exhibit mutational

signature profiles that distinguish them from CRCs from non-carriers, evidenced by the
combination of SBS18 and SBS36, and by SBS30, respectively. These distinct mutational
signature profiles have the potential to aid in rare variant classification for these genes.
Furthermore, we identified a novel association between both the proportion of SBS18 and
SBS36 and the TMB for specific MUTYH PVs. Our results highlight the additional utility of
ID-derived signatures for determining defective DNA MMR where the combination of ID2
and ID7 with SBS1 and SBS15 effectively differentiated Lynch syndrome CRCs from
MMRp CRCs. We have shown that mutational signatures generated from WES of FFPECRCs can effectively identify carriers of the common hereditary CRC and polyposis
syndromes and provides a functional assay to aid in the clinical genetics of CRC. Further
work is needed to distinguish germline MMR-deficiency from somatic MMR-deficiency in
order to improve the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome.

associated with MMRd dominate at most VAF thresholds (b, d, f), while relevant SBS
signatures are also present but less dominant, particularly at highly stringent settings (a, c, e).

MMRd controls (K01 to K09), mutational signatures do not effectively separate the two
groups (c, d) at any filtering settings.
