Abstract

23

Background: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals, detected in 95% of

24

Americans, that induce osteotoxicity and modulate hormones thereby influencing bone health.

25

Previous studies found associations between individual PFAS and bone mineral density but did

26

not analyze their combined effects.

27

Objective: To extend weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to a Bayesian framework

28

(BWQS) and determine the association between a mixture of serum PFAS and mineral density

29

in lumbar spine, total and neck femur in 499 adults from the 2013–2014 National Health and

30

Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

31

Methods: We used BWQS to assess the combined association of nine PFAS, as a mixture, with

32

bone mineral density in adults. As secondary analyses, we focused on vulnerable populations

33

(men over 50 years and postmenopausal women). Analyses were weighted according to

34

NHANES weights and were adjusted for socio-demographic factors. Sensitivity analyses

35

included bone mineral density associations with individual compounds and results from WQS

36

regressions.

37

Results: The mean age was 55 years old (Standard Error [SE]=1) with average spine, total and

38

neck femur mineral densities of 1.01 (SE=0.01), 0.95 (SE=0.01), and 0.78 (SE=0.01) gm/cm2,

39

respectively. PFAS mixture levels showed no evidence of association with mineral density

40

(spine: β=-0.004; 95% credible interval [CrI]=-0.04, 0.04; total femur: β=0.002; 95%CrI=-0.04,

41

0.05; femur neck: β=0.005; 95%CrI=-0.03, 0.04) in the overall population. Results were also null

42

in vulnerable populations. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses.

43

Conclusions: We introduced a Bayesian extension of WQS and found no evidence of the

44

association between PFAS mixture and bone mineral density.

Introduction

51

As the population ages, low bone mineral density has emerged as a public health concern

52

because it is related to fractures, morbidities, hospitalizations, and premature mortality.1,2

53

Deterioration of bone mass differs between the sexes, with a higher prevalence in women.

54

About 10% of women over 50 years of age suffer from low bone mineral density, but only 2%

55

of men of the same age have similar bone deterioration.3 Traditional risk factors associated with

56

decreased bone mineral density include chronological age, family history of bone disease,

57

suboptimal high-impact physical activity, and smoking.4 However, recent evidence suggests that

58

environmental exposures, including air pollution, lead, cadmium, and mercury, are associated

59

with lower bone mineral density and higher risks for osteoporosis.5-7

60
61

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic organic chemicals that have been

62

used extensively in industrial processes and commercial applications since the 1950s. These

63

chemicals are widely used and persist for long periods of time, resulting in increased levels of

64

environmental contamination.8,9 The primary sources of human PFAS exposure include

65

migration from food packaging and cookware, drinking water, indoor air, and house dust.10

66

PFAS have been detected in vivo in human tissue samples,11,12 in 95% of the U.S.

67

population.13 PFAS are poorly metabolized and excreted slowly from the human body, with half-

68

lives of 4–8 years.14 Previous human and animal studies showed that PFAS bioaccumulate in

69

bones, with perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) being predominant.15,16 Due to their limited susceptibility

70

to degradation and slow elimination by human bodies, human exposure to PFAS is of increasing

71

concern.17,18

72
73

The toxicity of PFAS to bones has been reported in human and animal studies, with high PFAS

74

concentrations associated with adverse skeletal outcomes, suggesting that bones are target

75

tissues for PFAS toxicity.19 PFAS are also endocrine-disrupting chemicals 20 based on their

76

hormonal modulation. 21 PFAS have been suggested to impact bone density via sex

77

hormones.22,23 In rodents, exposure to PFAS was negatively associated with bone structure and

78

biomechanical properties.24 Bone cell cultures showed increased bone resorption activity at low,

79

albeit environmentally relevant, PFAS concentrations in human bone marrow and peripheral

80

blood–derived osteoclasts, through the effect of PFAS on the cytokine and clastokine profiles

81

during cell differentiation.19 In human studies, bone PFAS concentrations and relative bone

82

volume have been correlated, but results are still inconclusive. In a few cross-sectional studies,

83

serum levels of a few PFAS were negatively associated with bone mineral density only in

84

women,19,21 but findings for most compounds are null in the general U.S. population.19,21 In

85

addition, all previous studies focused on the association between individual PFAS and bone

86

health outcomes; however, given their ubiquity and persistence, exposure likely occurs to many

87

PFAS simultaneously. Those studies failed to account for the correlation structure among PFAS

88

or to consider PFAS exposure as a mixture.

89
90

Environmental health studies have applied weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to assess

91

the mixture effect of multiple co-occurring factors and to identify the driving factors in the

92

mixture. Briefly, the WQS regression summarizes the overall exposure to the mixture by

93

estimating a single weighted index and accounts for the individual contribution of each

94

component of the mixture by using weights.25,26 WQS regression splits the dataset into two

95

subsets, a training set (generally 40%) and a validation set (60%). In the first set, this approach

96

estimates the weights using an ensemble step and estimates average weights across B

97

bootstrap samples, and in the second subset it estimates the coefficient mapped to the mixture,

98

conditionally to the estimated weights.25-27 This regression also requires a priori selection of the

99

directionality (positive or negative) of the coefficient associated with the mixture, and it

100

conditions on the weights in the weighted index for testing for significance using the hold out

101

validation set. As such, it does not provide diagnostics (confidence intervals, standard deviation,

102

and p values) about the weights of the components of the mixture.25,26

103
104

Here we proposed a novel Bayesian extension of the WQS regression (BWQS) to overcome its

105

limitations and to illustrate the method for assessing the combined association of several forms

106

of serum PFAS as a mixture with bone mineral density in 499 U.S. adults from the 2013–2014

107

cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).3,28 We also stratified

108

our analysis for two vulnerable populations, men over 50 years of age and postmenopausal

109

women.

Study population

113

The NHANES is an ongoing survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population designed to

114

assess their health and nutritional status.28 After providing informed consent, participants visited

115

a mobile examination center for standardized physical examination and collection of biological

116

specimens, which were used to assess exposure to environmental chemicals. All study

117

protocols were approved by the National Center for Health Statistics research ethics review

board 3,28. In our analyses, we included the 2013–2014 NHANES cycle, in which both bone

119

mineral density and serum PFAS concentrations were measured and had not been previously

120

studied. The 2013–2014 cycle also included four (linear and branched) PFAS isomers that were

121

not measured in any previous NHANES cycles. For both evaluations, the selection of NHANES

122

participants was random and designed to maintain the original NHANES characteristics, as

123

previously described.13,29 We excluded NHANES participants with missing information about

124

bone mineral measurements (N = 7060) or serum concentrations of PFAS (N = 1450) and those

125

with missing information on covariates (smoking and physical activity) or with bilateral

126

oophorectomy (N = 74). A total of 499 adults (≥40 years) was included in the main analysis.

127

Secondary analyses were performed on 115 men over 50 years and 117 postmenopausal

128

women. Postmenopausal women included women over 60 years old, women who had not had a

129

menstrual period in the previous 12 months. We excluded from the analysis postmenopausal

130

women using hormone replacement treatment or taking parathyroid medication (N=45), due to

131

their influence on the endocrine system (Figure 1).

132
133

Bone mineral density assessment

134

Bone mineral density (g/cm2) was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR

135

4500A fan-beam densitometers; Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA).3 Antero-posterior lumbar

136

spine mineral density was scanned, and mean density was computed for the first through fourth

137

lumbar vertebrae. For the total and neck femur mineral density, the left hip was routinely

138

scanned. If a left-hip replacement or metal objects in the left leg were reported, the right hip was

139

scanned. Participants were excluded from the femur scan if they had bilateral hip fractures,

140

bilateral hip replacements, or pins. Participants weighing > 300 lbs (136 kg) or pregnant women

141

(defined by self-report or positive urine pregnancy test) were ineligible for the examination.

142

Femur neck has been proposed as the reference skeletal site for defining osteoporosis in

143

epidemiologic studies,30 whereas the total femur had been used as a benchmark for

144

osteoporosis in the national Healthy People program 30. Each subject’s scan was reviewed in

145

the Department of Radiology, University of California, using standard radiologic techniques and

146

NHANES protocols.3

Serum PFAS measurements

149

Analysis of 12 PFAS in serum was conducted at the National Center for Environmental Health in

150

a random one-third subsample of nonfasting participants; the NHANES characteristic

151

proportions were maintained.13,29 Briefly, serum PFAS were measured using automated solid5

phase extraction coupled to isotope-dilution high-performance liquid chromatography– tandem

153

mass spectrometry.13 The complete list of PFAS with their acronyms is included in Table S1. In

154

our analyses, we excluded four PFAS because their concentrations were below the limit of

155

detection for more than 60% of samples (Table S1). For the remaining PFAS, when

156

concentrations were less than the limit of detection, a value equal to the limit of detection

157

divided by the square root of two was used in the analyses.

Statistical methods and analyses

160

The Bayesian WQS (BQWS) regression

161

Let the values for the correlated mixture components C be scored into quantiles (qji) for the j-th

162

component (j = 1,..,C) and the i-th (i = 1,…,N) participant. We modeled the association between

163

the overall mixture and the outcome yi using a generalized linear model framework
g(µi ) = β0 + β1 [∑𝑐𝑗=1 wj qji ] + ɣZ

164
165

where µi = E(yi), β0 is the intercept, and β1 is the coefficient mapped to the weighted index

166

(∑𝑐𝑗=1 wj qji ); g(.) is link function; and ɣ is a vector of K coefficients mapped to the matrix of K

167

covariates Z. Similar to WQS regression, we modeled the weight wj for exposure to the j-th

168

component as an arbitrary function, taking values between 0 and 1, and the sum of all mixture

169

weights to be equal to 1.

170
171

The BWQS required specification of the link function, similar to the frequentist approach, and

172

prior probability distributions on all parameters, which differs from WQS regression. The general

173

assumption for each parameter was a weak or uninformative prior. However, more informative

174

priors can be chosen when prior information is known. The link function assumed the following

175

forms:

176

a) logit link function: yi ~ binomial (1, µi), when Y was binary;

177

b) identity link function: yi~Normal(µi, σ2), with a noninformative prior for

178

σ2~IGamma(0.1,0.1), when Y was continuous.

179

Priors for the coefficients were uninformative or weakly informative and were summarized by

180

normal distributions with large variance [β0;β1~ Normal(0, 100); ɣk~Normal(0, 100)] for each k =

181

1,...,K. Priors for the weights were modelled as a unit-simplex in order to have non-negative

182

weights (wj Є (0,1)) and to sum all weights to one (Σwj = 1). The natural choice was the Dirichlet

183

distribution with the same density on each vertex for each component of the mixture; i.e., w =

184

(w1, …, wC) ~ Dirichlet(α = (α1,...,αC)). The α parameter can be selected a priori equal to 1, when

185

Statistical Analysis

190

We estimated the correlations among PFAS and then performed BWQS regression in which

191

bone mineral density (continuous)—in lumbar spine, total femur, and femur neck—was

192

associated with mixtures of PFAS. All analyses were adjusted for race/ethnicity (white, black,

193

Hispanic and other races), age (continuous), sex, physical activity (low-moderate or high),

194

poverty-income ratio (continuous), and smoking status (never or ever smoked). All variables

195

were selected based on previous association with the outcome.6,7,22 Priors for all coefficients

196

were uninformative: Normal(0,100). Secondary analyses focused on two vulnerable

197

populations—men over 50 years old and postmenopausal women.

198
199

As sensitivity analyses, we assessed the associations between the PFAS mixture and mineral

200

density in lumbar spine, total femur, and femur neck by using the frequentist WQS regression,

201

for the overall population. We also used Bayesian linear regression to determine the association

202

of each PFAS compound with bone mineral density in the overall population. We used R version

203

3.5.1 for all analyses. All analyses were weighted according to the NHANES weights,

204

appropriately rescaled for the selected subsample, as described on the Centers for Disease

205

Control and Prevention website and in previous studies.31,32

Study Population Characteristics

209

Adults included in our main analysis were 55 years old on average (standard error (SE): 0.6),

210

mostly Caucasian (49%), never smoked (60%), reported physical activity below the optimal level

211

(66%), and had an average poverty-income ratio of 2.9 (standard error (SE): 0.9) (Table 1). On

212

average, spine and (total and neck) femur mineral densities were 1.01 (SE: 0.01), 0.95

213

(SE:0.01), and 0.78 (SE:0.01) g/cm2, respectively, in the adult population. Bone mineral density

214

was different by sex, with postmenopausal women having lower density (p<0.05). In all groups,

215

serum concentrations of the linear and branched PFAS isomers (NPFOS, NPFOA, and

216

MPFOS) were higher than all other PFAS levels (PFHS, PFNA, PFDE, MPAH, and PFUA)

217

(Table 1). All serum PFAS concentrations were positively correlated with each other and

218

showed similar patterns across populations (Figure 2).

BWQS regression characteristics

221

We employed BWQS regression to identify the association between the mixture of PFAS in

222

subjects’ serum and bone mineral density in spine, total and neck femur, in all adults together

223

and in the most vulnerable populations separately.

224
225

PFAS concentrations were categorized into quartiles, and we set the main parameters of the

226

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo chain to optimize the accuracy and speed of the models. In total, we

227

set 1000 iterations, of which 500 were burn-in and 3 were thinned. All parameters showed no

228

autocorrelation between subsequent iterations, and the potential scale-reduction statistics,

229

which were approximately equal to 1 for all estimated parameters, showed convergence of the

230

chain to the equilibrium distributions (Table S2).

231
232

Results in the overall adult population

233

In the overall adult population there was no evidence of association between the PFAS mixture

234

and bone mineral density in lumbar spine (β=-0.004, 95% credible interval [CrI]: -0.04, 0.04)

235

g/cm2, total femur (β =0.002, 95% CrI: -0.04, 0.05) g/cm2, or femur neck (β=0.005, 95% CrI: -

236

0.03, 0.04) g/cm2. Components of the mixture contributed approximately equally to the mixture

237

in the outcomes for the overall population (Figures 3A, 4A, and 5A; Table S2).

238
239

Sensitivity analyses in the overall adult population

240

Results from sensitivity analyses using the frequentist WQS approach, assuming a negative

241

direction between PFAS mixture and bone mineral density, were similar to those of BWQS. We

242

found no associations between the PFAS mixture and all outcomes (lumbar spine: β = -0.01, p =

243

0.69; total femur: β = -0.01, p = 0.51; femur neck β = -0.004, p = 0.82) using the validation hold

244

out set of 70% (Figure S1, Table S3). Individual PFAS analyses showed a weak negative

245

association among MPFOS and all bones (lumbar spine: -0.02, 95% CrI: -0.03, -0.009; total

246

femur: -0.01, 95% CrI: -0.02, -0.003; and femur neck -0.01, 95% CrI: -0.02, -0.004), whereas

247

PFNA was positively associated with total femur (0.04, 95% CrI: 0.01, 0.06) and neck femur

248

(0.03, 95% CrI: 0.01, 0.05) (Figure S2, Table S4). However, those associations did not persist

249

after correcting for multiple comparisons (data not shown).

250
251

Results in men over 50 years old and in postmenopausal women

252

There was no evidence of an association between the PFAS mixture and bone mineral densities

femur neck β =0.02, 95% CrI: -0.03, 0.08). The contribution of all mixture components was

similar across bones and across populations (Figures 3-5 panels B and C; Table S2).

Discussion

260

We extended the WQS regression under a Bayesian framework and determined the combined

261

association of eight PFAS with bone mineral density in lumbar spine and total and neck femur in

262

a survey representative U.S. adult population in the years 2013–2014. The main BWQS

263

characteristics include diagnostic statistics for all estimated parameters, and BWQS does not

264

require a priori selection of the directionality of the coefficient associated with the mixture or

265

splitting the original dataset, thus overcoming a few limitations of the frequentist approach.

266
267

The application of our novel method showed no evidence of the association between serum

268

concentration of PFAS mixture, composed of linear and branched PFOS and PFOA isomers

269

(NPFOS, NPFOA, and MPFOS) and PFHS, PFNA, PFDE, MPAH, and PFUA, and bone mineral

270

density in lumbar spine and total and neck femur. The contribution of each compound was

271

similar across bones. Results were also consistent using the frequentist WQS approach and

272

Bayesian linear regressions.

273
274

Our results confirmed prior findings showing null associations between PFAS exposure and

275

bone health in the overall adult U.S. population. Serum concentrations of individual PFAS,

276

namely, PFOA, PFOS, PFHS, and PFNA, were not associated with mineral density in spine

277

and total and neck femur in the overall adult population in the 2009–2010 NHANES cycle.22

278

Previous findings showed that associations between a few individual PFAS compounds and

279

bone mineral density were negative and significant in women only, with higher concentrations of

280

PFOA, PFOS, PFHS, and PFNA associated with lower bone mineral density and with a higher

281

risk osteoporosis in women.22 However, those analyses ignored the correlations among those

282

compounds and did not consider PFAS as a mixture, thereby increasing the number of false

283

positives among significant results.

284
285

Epidemiological studies support the hypothesis that PFAS are endocrine disruptors. PFAS

286

modulate thyroid and sex hormone concentrations, which play a critical role in bone remodeling

287

and health 33. Chronic PFAS exposure was associated with suppressed serum thyroxine and

dependent cell line in vitro.36 A cross-sectional study of adult NHANES participants 35 reported

290

that serum PFHS was positively associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism in women, which is

291

a risk factor for decreased bone mass.37 PFAS also interfere directly with estrogen and

292

androgen receptors, disrupting the biological effects of sex hormones and leading to reduced

293

fecundity in women and delayed puberty in boys, both of which are associated with lower bone

294

mineral density later in life.23,38 In studies of women’s health, PFAS were associated with

295

decreased production of estradiol and progesterone, which are essential hormones for bone

296

health due to their promotion of osteoblast activity. Based on this body of literature, the PFAS

297

mixture, mediated by endocrine receptors, might affect bone mineral density, but further studies

298

with longitudinal design are required to address this problem.

299
300

We also found no evidence of an association between the PFAS mixture and bone mineral

301

density in vulnerable populations, including men over 50 years old and postmenopausal women.

302

However, our results could have been limited by a small number of participants (n = 115 and

303

117, respectively). Also, men and women in this study were not asked whether they attempted

304

to prevent bone deterioration by changes in lifestyle, such as using supplements or alternative

305

treatments or eating a healthier diet.

306
307

PFOA and PFOS, both of which were previously associated with bone mineral density in women

308

19,22

309

could not confirm previous results for those compounds. Due to the cross-sectional design of

310

our study, we could not rule out whether it was reverse causation and PFAS exposure preceded

311

the outcomes or bone mineral status affected the response to exposure 39. It is also possible

312

that our results may have been limited by the smaller number of participants (n=499) than other

313

study showing an association between the exposure of a few PFAS and bone mineral density

314

(n=1914).22 Further studies with longitudinal design and larger sample size could help to

315

disentangle the underlying mechanism linking PFAS exposure and bone health in older adults.

316
317

The strengths of our study include a novel statistical approach, which accounted for the

318

correlation among co-occurring PFAS and provided information about the overall adverse

319

associations of PFAS and bone density. We used a sample that is known to represent the U.S.

320

population in the years 2013–2014, and we relied on PFAS concentrations and bone mineral

321

density levels that were validated and compared across NHANES cycles.

Conclusions. This is the first study to assess the relationship between exposure to a mixture of

324

PFAS and bone mineral density at three bone sites. The novel Bayesian WQS approach

325

identified both the overall association between PFAS mixture with bone mineral density and the

326

contribution of each PFAS to the mixture. The serum PFAS mixture showed no association with

327

mineral density of the lumbar spine and total and neck femur in the NHANES adult population in

328

the years 2013–2014.

Figure 4. Estimates of the 1) association between lumbar spine mineral density and the
perfluorinated compound (PFAS) mixture and estimates of 2) mixture composition: weights
(percentage rescaled between 0 to 1) with 95% credible intervals for each mixture component in
A) the overall population, B) men over 50 years old, and C) postmenopausal women.
BMD = total femur bone mineral density adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, sex, physical activity,
poverty-income ratio, and smoking status.
