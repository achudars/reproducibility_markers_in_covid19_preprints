ABSTRACT
Objectives
To assess the association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer
risk in the Asian population.
Design
This is a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies that
investigated the relationship between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal
cancer risk in the Asian population.
Data Sources
Relevant studies were identified through a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
Web of Science from January 1980 to 31 January 2019. Eligibility criteria: original studies
published in peer-reviewed journals investigating the association between blood circulating
Vitamin D levels and the risk of colorectal cancer and/or adenoma in Asian countries.
Data extraction and synthesis:
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. Studyspecific ORs were pooled using a random-effects model. A dose-response meta-analysis was
performed with generalized least squares regression. We applied the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
quality assessment to evaluate the quality of the selected studies.
Results
The eight included studies encompassed a total of 2,916 cases and 6,678 controls. The pooled
ORs of colorectal cancer for the highest versus lowest categories of blood circulating Vitamin
D levels was 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97] up to 36.5 ng/mL in the Asian population. There was
heterogeneity among the studies (I2=53.9%, Pheterogeneity=0.034). The dose-response metaanalysis indicated a significant linear relationship (Pnon-linearity=0.11). An increment of 16
ng/mL in blood circulating Vitamin D level corresponded to an OR of 0.79 [95% CI, 0.640.97].
Conclusions
The results of this meta analysis indicate that blood circulating Vitamin D level is associated
with decreased risk of colorectal cancer in Asian countries. The dose-response meta-analysis
shows that the strength of this association among the Asian population is similar to that
among the Western population. Our study suggests that the Asian population should improve
nutritional status and maintain a higher level of blood circulating Vitamin D.

Strengths and limitations of this study
• Our study seeks to extend previous work by including a number of new studies and by
distinguishing the Asian population explicitly.
•

The number of included studies is not sufficient to provide a robust estimate, so the
results should be interpreted in the context of the limitations of the available data.

•

Heterogeneous definitions of blood circulating Vitamin D categories were used across
studies. The variability in definitions could limit comparability between studies.

•

Our study included seven case-control studies; the study design implies that the
measurement of blood circulating Vitamin D is measured in individuals already
diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Results from case-control studies need to be
interpreted cautiously because of the potential for reverse causation.

•

Time of blood sampling in relation to outcome ascertainment also varied among
studies. Such cross-sectional measurements may not accurately reflect an individual’s
Vitamin D status across time.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and second in terms of
mortality. With over 1.8 million new cases, and 881,000 deaths worldwide in 2018, it
accounts for about 1 in 10 cancer cases and deaths.1 Some Asian countries where the
incidence of colorectal cancer was historically low, such as Japan, Israel, Singapore, China,
and the Philippines, have experienced rising incidence rates over the past decades. In 2012,
Japan (Miyagi Prefecture Cancer Registry) presented the highest colorectal cancer incidence
in the world for men (62 per 100,000 persons) and women (37 per 100,000 persons).2
Observational studies have identified several risk factors associated with an increased
incidence of colorectal cancer including lifestyle factors (e.g., obesity, physical inactivity,
smoking, and heavy alcohol use) and non-modifiable factors (e.g., aging, personal and family
history of colorectal cancer or adenoma).3 Other observational studies conducted in Western
countries suggest blood circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (Vitamin D) has a
protective role in the development of colorectal cancer.4-8 Some meta-analyses have
consistently reported that there was an inverse association between plasma Vitamin D
concentration in the blood and incidence of, and mortality from colorectal cancer.9-15
The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency has increased in recent decades.16 17 In a
recent population-based study of Asian adults, approximately 75% had suboptimal Vitamin D
concentrations.18 The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline defines Vitamin D
deficiency as 25(OH)D level <20 ng/mL and insufficiency as 21 to 29 ng/mL.19 Feldman et al.
20

reported anti-neoplastic actions of Vitamin D, particularly in colorectal cancer.9 Touvier et

al.12 reported that improving Vitamin D levels could be beneficial in reducing colorectal
cancer incidence. Data from a cohort of healthy women showed that plasma Vitamin D levels
was inversely related to the occurrence and death from colorectal cancer.21 In the Nurses'
Health Study, total circulating Vitamin D was associated with a lower risk of colorectal
cancer in white women.22 A recent international study of 17 cohorts in Western population
found that Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk, and
Vitamin D above sufficiency levels was associated with 19% to 27% lower risk.23 Compared
with Western countries, there was an inconsistent conclusion about the relationship between
blood circulating Vitamin D level and colorectal cancer risk in studies of Asian countries,24-30
given that lifestyle, ethnic and environmental factors are different between Asian and
Western countries.

We hypothesized that the association between blood circulating Vitamin D and
colorectal cancer in Asian countries is distinct from Western countries. Thus, this review
aimed to summarize epidemiological evidence regarding blood circulating Vitamin D level
and colorectal cancer risk in Asian countries. This study underlines the public health
importance of attaining and maintaining an optimal vitamin D status in the Asian population
and may help to guide clinical and nutritional practice in Asians countries.
METHODS

We performed the systematic review according to a predetermined protocol and reported in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.31 Two reviewers (L.Z. and Z.Q.) independently undertook
the literature search, assessment for eligibility, data extraction, and qualitative assessment.
Any inconsistencies between the two reviewers were reviewed by a third reviewer (Y.J.) and
resolved by consensus.

Eligibility criteria
Participants: Our study uses the list of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia by
the United Nation (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/) to draw participants from
48 countries located in five regions (Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Southeastern
Asia, and Western Asia). Asians, and people of Asian origin who live in Western countries
were excluded.
Exposure: The exposure is blood circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level which is
commonly measured to assess and monitor Vitamin D status in individuals. Most studies only
report the total level and do not distinguish D2 and D3 forms of the vitamin. In our metaanalysis, we consider the total level of Vitamin D as the exposure.
Comparators (controls): In order to be eligible for inclusion, studies must compare outcomes
in a group of exposed individuals with the highest category of blood circulating Vitamin D
level and a group of unexposed individuals with the lowest category of blood circulating
Vitamin D level.
Outcome: Studies included in the review have a diagnosis of colorectal cancer or colorectal
adenoma, clinically confirmed by colonoscopy or pathology.

Study design: We target observational studies (case-control, cross-sectional and cohort).
English language studies conducted post-1980 were considered eligible. Animal studies were
excluded.

Studies were excluded if they: 1) were reviews, editorial, case report, or guideline
articles; 2) did not explicitly state the blood circulating Vitamin D level and its association
with colorectal cancer risk; 3) allowed controls to have a previous disease history of cancer; 4)
focused on Western population or Asian population living in Western countries; or 5)
investigated the blood circulating Vitamin D level and its association with survival of
colorectal cancer. By consensus among all three reviewers (L.Z., Z.Q. and Y.J.), if data
sources were duplicated in more than one study, only the original study was included in the
meta-analysis.
Search strategy
We conducted a literature search using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science, and retrieved
all relevant articles that reported the association plasma or serum Vitamin D level and the risk
of colorectal neoplasia in Asian countries, published from January 1980 to 31 January 2019.
The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms were used in conjunction with the following
keywords for our search: (colorectal neoplasm or colon neoplasm or colorectal cancer or
colon cancer) AND (25-OH-D or cholecalciferol or calcidiol or calcitriol or 25hydroxyVitamin D or hydroxycholecalciferols or 25-hydroxyVitamin D3 or 1-alphahydroxylase or Vitamin D) AND (Asia* or Afghanistan or Armenia or Azerbaijan or Bahrain
or Bangladesh or Bhutan or Brunei or Cambodia or China or Cyprus or Georgia or India or
Indonesia or Iran or Iraq or Israel or Japan or Jordan or Kazakhstan or Kuwait or Kyrgyzstan
or Laos or Lebanon or Malaysia or Maldives or Mongolia or Myanmar or Burma or Nepal or
North Korea or Oman or Pakistan or Palestine or Philippines or Qatar or Russia or Saudi
Arabia or Singapore or South Korea or Sri Lanka or Syria or Taiwan or Tajikistan or
Thailand or Timor-Leste or Turkey or Turkmenistan or United Arab Emirates or Uzbekistan
or Vietnam or Yemen). Full search strings are presented in Table S1. References from
relevant articles, editorials, conference abstracts, letters, and reviews were thoroughly
reviewed to identify additional studies. Full manuscripts of every article with a relevant title
and abstract were then reviewed for eligibility.

Data extraction and qualitative assessment
Two reviewers (L.Z. and Z.H.Q) independently extracted the following study-level
characteristics from each eligible study: first author, year of publication, type of study,
country where the study was conducted, selection criteria, the numbers of cases and controls
(for case-control studies or cross-sectional studies) and the numbers of total participants and
incident cases (for cohort studies), population characteristics (sex and age), follow-up period
(for cohort studies), sample size, levels of Vitamin D in both case and control group,
measures and ranges of Vitamin D, adjusted variables, and risk estimates with corresponding
95% CI for each category. For studies that reported both crude and adjusted estimates of the
association between blood circulating Vitamin D and risk of colorectal cancer or adenoma,
we used the adjusted estimates for the meta-analysis. For studies that reported several
adjusted estimates of association, we used the estimates adjusted for the most variables.
We applied the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tool to evaluate
the quality of the selected observational studies. This tool was used to measure the key
aspects of the methodology in selected studies with regard to design quality and the risk of
biased estimates based on three design criteria: 1) selection of study participants; 2)
comparability of study groups; and 3) assessment of outcome and exposure with a star system
(with a maximum of 9 stars). We judged studies that received a score of 7-9 stars to be at low
risk of bias, studies that scored 4-6 stars to be at medium risk, and those that scored 3 or less
to be at high risk of bias. A funnel plot was used to assess the publication bias. Any
disagreement on the data extraction and quality assessment of the studies were resolved
through comprehensive discussion (L.Z., Z.Q, and Y.J.).

Statistical analysis

Study-specific OR estimates were combined using a random-effects model, that considers
within-study and between-study variations. Corresponding 95% CIs were extracted directly
from articles where available, with adjusted ORs extracted preferentially over unadjusted
ORs. The dose-response analysis was utilized to assess the relationship between blood
circulating Vitamin D level and colorectal cancer risk using the generalized least squares
(GLS) method to resolve the inconsistency issue of different Vitamin D levels in included
studies.32 33 For the dose-response meta-analysis of blood circulating Vitamin D levels, we
used a method proposed by previous studies to compute the trend from the correlated log OR
estimates across categories of Vitamin D levels.34 This analytical method collected the
distribution of cases and controls, median values of blood circulating Vitamin D levels, and
corresponding OR estimates in each category for each study. The assigned value of the
lowest category was designated as a reference level. If the study did not provide median
values of blood Vitamin D, the midpoint of the upper and lower boundaries in each category
was assigned. For the open-ended exposure categories, the length of the open-ended interval
was assumed to be the same as that of the adjacent interval. We examined a potential nonlinear dose-response relationship between blood circulating Vitamin D level with colorectal
cancer risk by modelling Vitamin D levels using random-effect restricted cubic splines with
three knots at percentiles 25%, 50%, and 75% of the distribution (spline model). A P-value
for nonlinearity was calculated by testing the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient of
the second spline was equal to zero by Wald-type test of nonlinear hypotheses.34 A small Pvalue (<0.05) of the Wald-type test indicates departure from linearity. The non-linear doseresponse relationship was confirmed by several representative point values and the risk
estimates of a subgroup analysis based on the range of exposure.
The statistical heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using Cochran’s Q test and
I2 statistic, with values of 25%, 50%, and 75% representing low, moderate, and high
heterogeneity, respectively.35 The criterion for identifying heterogeneity was a P value less
than 0.05 for the Q test. If substantial heterogeneity was detected, we performed univariate
meta-regression analyses to explore the proportion of between-study variance explained by
study quality, participant characteristics, and study characteristics. We were unable to
perform a multivariate meta-regression analysis as only a small number of included studies
reported information for all study-level factors. We performed subgroup analyses comparing

pooled association estimates and heterogeneity with stratification by, participants sex,
outcome type, subregion of Asia, blood sample type, and range of Vitamin D levels (The
range is the difference in the midpoint between the highest and lowest categories of blood
circulating Vitamin D in each study). An estimation of publication bias was evaluated by the
Beggs funnel plot, in which the SE of log (OR) of each study was plotted against its log
(OR). An asymmetrical plot suggests possible publication bias. Egger's linear regression test
assessed funnel plot asymmetry, a statistical approach to identify funnel plot asymmetry on
the natural logarithm scale of the ORs. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
(version 14.2; StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). All P values were two-sided, and P
<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS
Selection of studies
A detailed PRISMA flow diagram31 of literature search and inclusion criteria is shown in
Figure 1. A total of 611 studies were initially identified with this literature search (250 from
Medline, 272 from Embase and 89 from Web of Science), but 114 studies were excluded due
to duplication and 465 were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts. Twenty-four
other studies were excluded after full-text review (details shown in Table S2). Finally, a total
of eight studies were identified as eligible for meta-analysis.
Study characteristics
The eight studies included had a total of 2,916 cases and 6,678 controls (Tables 1 and 2).
These studies were published between 2007 and 2018 - seven from Eastern Asia (four are
from Japan,24 25 27 30 two from Korea,26 28 and one from China;36) and one is from Western
Asia.29 Regarding study design, seven were case-control,24-29 36 and one was a nested casecohort study.30 Of the eight studies, four provided the main endpoint of colorectal cancer24 29
30 36

and the remaining four provided the main endpoint of colorectal adenoma.25-28

Meta-analysis and dose-response analysis
The multivariable-adjusted ORs for each study and the combination of all eight studies for
the highest versus lowest categories of blood circulating Vitamin D levels are shown in
Figure 2. The mean blood circulating Vitamin D level of the included study population was
20.21 ng/mL, with an SD of 7.92 ng/mL, the minimal concentration of 3.65 ng/mL, and the
maximal concentration of 36.5 ng/mL. Results from the studies on blood circulating Vitamin
D levels in relation to colorectal cancer risk were inconsistent, with both inverse and positive
associations reported. The pooled ORs of colorectal cancer for the highest versus lowest
categories of blood circulating Vitamin D level was 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97], which indicate
higher blood circulating Vitamin D level had a significant inverse association with risk of
colorectal cancer. There was statistically significant heterogeneity among the studies
(I2=53.9%, P=0.034).

We evaluated the non-linear dose-response relationship between blood circulating
Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk. A 16 ng/mL increment (about 2 SDs=15.84

ng/mL) in blood circulating Vitamin D levels conferred an OR of 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97],
which meant the risk of colorectal cancer decreased by 21% for every 16 ng/mL increment in
blood Vitamin D, and the reduction was statistically significant. A moderate heterogeneity
existed (I2=53.9%, Pheterogeneity=0.034) in the overall analysis of blood circulating Vitamin D
levels, without a significant non-linear dose-response relationship (Pnon-linearity=0.11),
suggesting that the non-linear dose-response relationship does not depart from linearity.
Similar trends were observed with linear and spline models (Figure 3).

Subgroup analysis
When we stratified the analysis according to blood sample type, the pooled ORs of serum
sample and plasma for the highest versus lowest categories of blood circulating Vitamin D
levels were 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34-0.80] and 0.77 [95% CI, 0.59-1.00] respectively. The results
showed that there was a substantial risk reduction (48%) for blood serum Vitamin D levels
associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. There was no evidence of significant statistical
heterogeneity among studies (I2=22.67%, P=0.21). We then performed a subgroup analysis
of blood circulating Vitamin D range in each study. The pooled ORs was 0.93 [95% CI, 0.701.25] for studies with range ≤15 ng/mL and 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.83] for studies with range
>15 ng/mL. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity among studies (I2=28.48%,
P=0.08).When stratified by outcome, the pooled ORs were 0.67 [95% CI, 0.40-1.14] for
studies when the outcome was colorectal adenoma and 0.83 [95% CI, 0.66-1.06] when the
outcome was colorectal cancer respectively with no significantly statistical heterogeneity
among studies (I2=59.48%, P=0.73). When we stratified the studies by sex, the pooled ORs
were 0.59 [95% CI, 0.13-2.74] for studies with estimates for women, and 1.13 [95% CI, 0.811.58] for men respectively with no significantly statistical heterogeneity among studies
(I2=45.89%, P=0.70). We also stratified according to the geographical region of the
population. The pooled ORs was 0.75 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00] for Eastern Asia and 0.69 [95%
CI, 0.36-1.34] for Western Asia. There was no significantly statistical heterogeneity among
studies (I2=59.79%, P=0.87). The subgroup meta-analyses are shown in Figure S1 and
summarized in Table 3.

The NOS tool was used to conduct a qualitative assessment of the selected studies to review
the quality of the studies and detect possible bias. Of the eight studies, five were at low risk
of bias (8-9) stars.24-27 30 Three studies were at medium risk (5-7 stars) mainly due to bias
from representativeness of cases or controls, control definition, and response rate.29 36

( shown in Table S3.) The funnel plot and Eggers statistical test indicated no evidence of

publication bias in the studies included in the meta-analysis (P=0.338) (Figure S2.)

DISCUSSION
Colorectal cancer is one of the cancers with high morbidity and mortality in the world. The
one-carbon metabolism pathway requires adequate Vitamin D, and this raises the possibility
that Vitamin D may have an essential role in the risk of colorectal cancer. Many
epidemiological studies from Europe and the United States believe that increasing the
concentration of circulating Vitamin D can reduce the morbidity and mortality of colorectal
cancer.38 However, the association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and the risk of
colorectal cancer in the Asian population is still under debate due to a lack of sufficient
evidence. This systematic review highlights the inconsistencies among studies addressing the
role of blood circulating Vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk in the Asian population. Our
systematic review identified eight studies consisting of 2916 cases and 6678 controls that
addressed the relationship between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer
risk. Our meta-analysis found 25% reduced risk of colorectal cancer for the highest versus
lowest categories of blood circulating Vitamin D levels (OR=0.75, 0.58-0.97) up to 36.5
ng/mL, that indicated higher blood circulating Vitamin D level has a significant inverse
association with risk of colorectal cancer in Asian population. Our meta-analysis results
showed that the negative correlation between Vitamin D and the risk of colorectal cancer is
similar to that of European and American population studies11 12 21 22 39-42 and consistent with
the result of a meta-analysis by Ekmekcioglu C et al.13 , that found a pooled relative risk (RR)
of 0.62 (0.56–0.70) for colorectal cancer when comparing individuals with the highest
category of 25(OH)D with those in the lowest.
Our results found a 16 ng/mL increment in blood circulating Vitamin D levels with an
OR of 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97], which meant the risk of colorectal cancer decreased by 21%
for every 16 ng/mL increment in blood Vitamin D, and the reduction was statistically
significant. Our study also suggested a linear dose-response relationship (Pnon-linearity= 0.11),
that was consistent with several studies conducted in Western populations revealing a similar
protective dose-response association of the blood circulating Vitamin D and colorectal cancer
risk. For example, a meta-analysis reported a 26% lower risk of colorectal cancer per 10
ng/mL increment in blood circulating Vitamin D levels.11 Most experts define Vitamin D
deficiency as a Vitamin D level of less than 20 ng/mL.43 44 Vitamin D concentration of 21 to
29 ng/mL can be considered to indicate a relative insufficiency of Vitamin D, and a level of
30 ng/mL or higher can be considered to indicate sufficient Vitamin D.45 With the use of such
definitions, it has been estimated that many people have Vitamin D deficiency or

insufficiency.43 44 Previous research has implied an association between Vitamin D deficiency
and an increased incidence of bone fractures.46 There is also data showing Vitamin D
deficiency to be associated with cancer,47-49 diabetes,50 cognitive impairment,51 and all-cause
mortality.52 Among colorectal cancer patients, the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency was
much higher (nearly 90%) than among patients with other chronic diseases.53 Humans obtain
Vitamin D from exposure to sunlight, from natural diets, fortified diets, supplementation
etc.46 Dose-response between Vitamin D concentrations and colorectal cancer risk may be
different between Asian and Western populations due to ethnic, anthropometric, dietary, and
environmental factors.12 Lifestyle and diet can promote the development of early-onset colon
lesions by regulating growth factors that interact with inflammatory pathways.41 An
association between Vitamin D status and reduced risk of colorectal cancer has been found in
ethnically diverse populations.5 Vitamin D interacts with calcium to enhance the reduction of
colon cancer risk.54-56 Studies have shown that Vitamin D and calcium may interact and that
both are needed in reducing cancer risk.57 However, even after adjusting for calcium intake in
some studies,6 58 Vitamin D was associated with a lower risk. The independent effects of
Vitamin D are supported, but the combined effects of Vitamin D and calcium may be greater
than the sum of their independent effects.59 Vitamin A has an antagonistic effect on Vitamin
D 58 and taking both at the same time can lead to decreased calcium absorption. Still, Vitamin
A is often combined with Vitamin D in supplements.
Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced total cancer mortality but did not
reduce total cancer incidence. 60 Patients with low-risk prostate cancer under active
surveillance may benefit from vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 IU/d.61 Among patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer, the addition of high-dose Vitamin D3, vs standard-dose
Vitamin D3, to standard chemotherapy resulted in a difference in median progression-free
survival that was not statistically significant, but with a significantly improved supportive
effect.62 Epidemiological evidence links the incidence of colorectal cancer to lifestyle,
smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and sleep.63 It has also been linked to
reduced fruit and vegetable consumption and increased consumption of red meat. Dairy
products, fish and other foods and cooking methods also play an essential role.64 In addition,
some drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase inhibitors are
also involved.65 Women on estrogen therapy, for example, did not reduce their risk of
colorectal cancer by taking Vitamin D and calcium supplements.66 Increased dietary fiber
intake reduces the risk of colorectal cancer and obesity; and low physical activity may reduce

plasma 25(OH)D concentration, thereby increasing the risk of colorectal cancer.42 For every
1kg/m2 increase in BMI of colorectal cancer patients, serum Vitamin D level decreased
significantly (0.46 ng/mL).67 Most variation in Vitamin D levels usually comes from
exposure to the sun, which is an essential source of Vitamin D for people who get more from
fish, even in Japan.68
This meta-analytic comparison revealed a statistically significant beneficial effect of
blood circulating Vitamin D for colorectal cancer. However, the diversity of the studies and
the presence of moderate heterogeneity in the overall analysis of blood circulating Vitamin D
levels (I2=53.9%, Pheterogeneity=0.034) may preclude making meaningful conclusions from the
pooled estimate because it may not reflect the true underlying effect. The subgroup analysis
did not explain much of the heterogeneity.
Potential reasons for the heterogeneity in the strength of the association may include
the following. Firstly, food consumption and vitamin supplements varied according to the
specific dietary habits and lifestyle in each Asian subregion. A systemic review studied
correlations between various diet types, food or nutrients and colorectal cancer risk among
Asians, and suggested that red meats, processed meats, preserved foods, saturated/animal
fats, cholesterol, high sugar foods, spicy foods, tubers or refined carbohydrates have a
positive association with colorectal cancer risk.69 Besides diet, other personal and lifestyle
factors (e.g., exposure to sunlight, obesity, smoking and drinking habit) may alter the strength
of the association and contribute to the heterogeneity of the association in Asian countries.
The numbers of studies from the different Asian subregions included in our meta-analysis
was imbalanced, so we were cautious in interpreting results. For example, our meta-analysis
included seven studies from Eastern Asia, only one from Western Asia, and none from
Central, Southern or South-eastern Asia. Our study revealed no evidence of publication bias,
and most of the studies included in our meta-analysis verified the diagnosis of colorectal
cancer for cases. Histologic confirmation of cancer diagnoses for cases was an optimal
validation for the case-control design in our meta-analysis.
Possible confounders for the association between colorectal cancer and blood
circulating Vitamin D levels include sex, age, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking,
alcohol drinking, body mass index, and diabetes. Most studies in our meta-analysis provided
risk estimates that were adjusted for age,24 26-30 36 sex,24 26 27 29 30 36 body mass index,24-30 36
smoking,24-30 36 drinking,24-26 29 36 physical activity,30 alcohol consumption,24-30 and family
history of colorectal cancer.24 25 29 Fewer were adjusted for folate,24 37 energy intake,24 27

hypertension,36 vitamin D binding protein,36 blood collection,24 27 or for vitamin supplement
use.24 For these studies, the observed reduced risk of colorectal cancer associated with
Vitamin D levels is likely confounded by one or more of these factors.
In the overall analysis for both adenoma and carcinoma that is part of our subgroup
analysis, we report a statistically significant association; yet, in the stratified analysis by
colorectal adenoma or colorectal cancer separately, the association was not statistically
significant. The results, however, show that associations were in the same direction (ORs<1
indicating an inverse relationship). Uncontrolled confounders (e.g. dietary sources of Vitamin
D, consumption of fish/fibres containing 25(OH)D, exposure to the sun, folate/calcium intake,
Vitamin D supplement use etc.) in the original studies that are part of our meta-analysis may
be responsible for these differences. Of note, only one of the 8 studies in our meta-analysis
adjusted for these confounders.24 The presence of negative confounders in original colorectal
cancer studies (OR’s are closer to 1), and positive confounders in original colorectal adenoma
studies (OR’s are further from 1) as well as some effect modification may also be responsible
for the statistical significance difference noted. We used a random effects model in our
analysis to reduce this effect. Further investigation of the subgroup analysis show that the
weight of the studies could also be contributory. Two studies25 30 contribute a large weight in
the subgroup meta-analysis, but a smaller weight in the overall analysis.
Our analysis had the following limitations. First, the number of included studies is not
sufficient to provide a robust estimate of the association of blood circulating Vitamin D
levels and colorectal cancer risk, so the analysis and results should be interpreted in the
context of the limitations of the available data. Second, heterogeneous definitions of blood
circulating Vitamin D categories were used across studies. The variability in definitions could
limit comparability between studies. Third, our study included seven case-control studies; the
study design impling that the measurement of blood circulating Vitamin D is in individuals
already diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The results from this study design need to be
interpreted cautiously because of the potential for reverse causation. The time of blood
sampling in relation to outcome ascertainment also varied among studies. Such crosssectional measurements may not accurately reflect an individual’s Vitamin D status across
time. Fourth, some studies included in our meta-analysis did not adjust for potentially
relevant confounders which may have led to residual confounding and may explain some of
the observed heterogeneity. Fifth, the difference in the method used for measuring blood
circulating Vitamin D levels may also be a source of heterogeneity between the included

studies. Sixth, in the dose-response analysis, the literature selected listed the median Vitamin
D value, instead of the original Vitamin D value, which could also lead to inaccurate results.
Seventh, although we assessed the quality of the observational studies in this meta-analysis
with the NOS quality assessment tool, Bae 70 suggested that it is more reasonable to control
for quality level by performing subgroup analysis according to study design rather than by
using the NOS tool. In this context, however, we did not perform subgroup analysis
according to study design since the included 8 studies were case-control and nested casecohort studies. Finally, a recent meta-analysis investigated the association between blood
circulating Vitamin D levels and survival of colorectal cancer and found that the pooled
hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.68 [0.55–0.85] and 0.67 [0.57–0.78]
respectively for overall and colorectal cancer-specific survival comparing highest versus
lowest categories of blood Vitamin D.15 Our study did not explore the association of blood
circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer mortality however, and this association in
Asian countries is one we would encourage future studies to examine.

CONCLUSION
Blood circulating Vitamin D levels is inversely associated with colorectal cancer prevalence
in the Asian population. Our findings on the inverse association between blood circulating
Vitamin D and the risk of colorectal cancer in the Asian population suggest the need for
Asians to improve their nutritional status and maintain higher blood circulating Vitamin D
levels. This meta-analysis provides valuable information for future research on the
association between blood circulating Vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk in the Asian
population. A multinational, population-based study in Asian countries may resolve the issue
of heterogeneity and generate detailed information on blood circulating Vitamin D levels and
the risk of colorectal cancer. Further studies may also focus on evaluating the association of
Vitamin D levels with colorectal cancer mortality.60

Figure 2 Meta-analysis of association between blood circulating Vitamin D and the
risk of colorectal cancer. The adjusted odds ratios were included of colorectal cancer
for the highest versus lowest categories of blood Vitamin D level from each study.
The size of each square is proportional to the weight of the study. The range is the
difference in the midpoint between the highest and lowest categories of blood
Vitamin D.

Figure 3. Dose-response relationship between blood Vitamin D levels and the ORs of
colorectal cancer. Adjusted Odds Ratio and 95% CIs (dashed lines) are reported.
Blood Vitamin D levels were modelled with a linear and spline model in a
random-effects meta-regression model. The median value of the lowest reference
interval (3.65 ng/mL) was used to estimate all Odds ratios. The vertical axis is on a
log scale. Lines with long dashes represent the pointwise 95% confidence intervals for
the fitted spline model with a nonlinear trend (solid line, Pnon-linearity=0.11). Lines with
short dashes represent the linear trend.
