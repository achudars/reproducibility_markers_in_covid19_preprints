Abstract

Online medical reference websites are utilized by health care providers to enhance their education and
decision making. However, these resources may not adequately reveal pharmaceutical-author interactions
and their potential conflicts of interest (CoIs). This investigation: 1) evaluates the correspondence of two
well-utilized CoI databases: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments (CMSOP)
and ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs (PDD) and 2) quantifies CoIs among authors of a publically available
point of care clinical support website. Two data sources were used: the hundred most common drugs and
the top fifty causes of death. These topics were entered into a freely available database. The authors (N =
139) were then input into CMSOP and PDD and compensation and number of payment were determined
for 2013-2015. The subset of highly compensated authors that also reported “Nothing to disclose” were
further examined. There was a high degree of similarity between CMSOP and PDD for compensation (R2
> 0.998) and payment number (R2 > 0.992). The amount received was 1.4% higher in CMSOP
($4,059,194) than in PDD ($4,002,891). The articles where the authors had received the greatest
compensation were in neurology (Parkinson’s Disease = $1,810,032), oncology (Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia = $616,727), and endocrinology (Type I Diabetes = $377,388). Two authors reporting
“Nothing to disclose” received appreciable and potentially relevant compensation. CMSOP and PDD
produced almost identical results. CoIs were common among authors but self-reporting may be an
inadequate reporting mechanism. Recommendations are offered for improving the CoI transparency of
pharmaceutical-author interactions in point-of-care electronic resources.

Medscape is a medical reference site which can be used for medical advising and as a source of
continuing medical education. The writers of these articles on diseases, symptoms, or drugs are health
care professionals. Medscape was founded in 1995 as an online resource for better patient care for health
professionals and interested consumers. It sought to provide peer-reviewed and edited information by
renowned clinicians in fields such as AIDS, other infectious diseases, urology, and surgery (Frishauf,
2005). Medscape’s primary target was originally American clinicians but was available to anyone who
registered for a free account. This open-door policy gave both physicians and laypersons equal access to
healthcare related materials. Medscape currently provides medical news, journals, and Continuing
Medical Education to healthcare professionals and information to non-healthcare professionals. If an
author of a well-used, site is receiving funding from an outside company to advocate for a certain drug or
treatment modality, it may put patients at risk for biased guidance or encouraging practices that are
inconsistent with evidence based medicine. Medscape does provide some limited conflict of interest (CoI)
disclosure information in terms of specific companies and involvement. However, this database does not
disclose the quantity of remuneration. A $10 lunch may have a different potential for influence (Liu et al.
2017) than if compensation was sufficient to purchase a vacation, car, or new home.
The two databases that report pharmaceutical-physician interactions in the US are the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Service’s Open Payments (CMSOP) and ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs (PDD).
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act established the National Physician Transparency Program, also
known as Open Payments as part of section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and requires pharmaceutical
companies and medical device manufacturers to report payments given to physicians or teaching hospitals
(Marshall et al. 2016). It also discloses any ownership or investments held in US based medical
companies. CMSOP was established in 2013 and includes a national database that shows the payments
physicians have received from pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The accuracy of CMSOP
was challenged in a study that determined that approximately one-quarter of doctors labeled as
neurosurgeons were not (Babu et al. 2016). The PDD database was released by the nonprofit investigative

journalism organization ProPublica in 2010 (Jones et al. 2016). PDD contains 9.2 billion in payments
made to over nine-hundred thousand doctors by two-thousand companies (Tigas et al. 2018). The user
interface differs slightly between PDD and CMSOP but PDD provides more CoI information including
about specific products.
CoIs have previously been quantified for some influential materials (Liu et al. 2017). Threequarters of the working groups responsible for writing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-5), the “bible” of psychiatry, were composed of members where the majority had ties to
the pharmaceutical industry (Cosgrove & Krimsky, 2012). Although the dominant CoI framework is that
the remuneration may precede potential influence, the reverse sequence may also occur. Advisors
responsible for the approvals of the blood thinner ticagrelor (Brilanta) and the atypical antipsychotic
quetiapine (Seroquel) received appreciable research support after being named to these government
committees (Piller, 2018). Over one-quarter (26.2%) of Goodman and Gilman’s Pharmacological Basis
of Therapeutics, a cornerstone pharmacology textbook in medical and pharmacy schools, had an
undisclosed patent (Piper et al. 2016). Examination of six medical textbooks revealed 20 million
unreported dollars according to PDD and 677 undisclosed patents (Piper et al. 2018). Inaccurate
disclosures, defined as a failure to report receipt of > $5,000, were identified in 89.3% of clinical practice
guidelines (Andreatos et al. 2017). A half-dozen conditions were searched in two subscription-based
point-of-care databases and self-reported CoIs were common among authors and editors (Amber et al.
2014). However, no prior research has systematically examined publically available point of care
computerized resources. Although it is assumed that CMSOP and PDD will produce equivalent results,
the degree of correspondence between these databases is currently unknown.
Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: 1) determine whether PDD and CMSOP produce
similar results, and 2) quantify the extent that Medscape authors received external funding from
pharmaceutical and medical device companies. As some have found that self-reported CoI disclosure is

that reported “Nothing to disclose.”

Methods
Procedures: A list of the hundred most common drugs in the US was compiled (Supplementary
Appendix) and an article pertaining to each was obtained in October, 2017. For example, for the #1 drug
(levothyroxine), the corresponding entry was identified. Next, the top fifty causes of death compiled by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US in 2014 was entered into either Google or
Medscape. If the search was conducted with Google, the cause was followed by “Medscape”. This
technique assisted in screening for relevant Medscape articles. Next, the most descriptive and longest
article was recorded along with the authors, co-authors, and editors. For example, one of the top causes of
death is Prostate Cancer (Malignant), and this was matched to a Medscape article titled, “Metastatic and
Advanced Prostate Cancer”. With the exception of #4-Unintentional Injury, #32-Disorder of
Nonrheumatic Aortic Valve and #44 Kidney Failure (unspecified), this strategy was almost always (48/51
or 94.1%, note that there were two entries for “lung cancer-malignant”, non-small cell lung cancer and
small cell lung cancer) successful in identifying a relevant entry. Each author’s or editor’s name was input
into PDD and CMSOP. The three available full-years (2013, 2014, and 2015) were examined. The
number of payments and amounts were recorded (and verified on March, 2018). The author’s gender was
also recorded. The authors, co-authors, and editors were then searched on CMSOP. In the rare instance of
multiple entries with the same first and last name, the listed location needed to be within commuting
distance and the middle-initial and specialty (e.g. neurologist) were also examined. The years, the number
of payments and payment amounts received were recorded. The medications and medical devices
reported by PDD were further examined among authors or editors that reported “Nothing to disclose” as
these discordant disclosures were of interest (Leo & Lacasse, 2009). All information reported is publically
available. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Wright Center of Scranton.
Data-analysis: A regression (R2) analysis was completed to determine the association between
CMSOP and PDD. The null hypothesis was that there was no association between these databases. A

Results
For the drug articles, the Medscape Drugs and Diseases Advisory Board (N = 8, 25.0% female)
was analyzed with 75% having entries in PDD and CMSOP (Min = 1, Max = 31 payments; Min = $128,
Max = $71,268). One author that wrote widely on oncology therapeutics reported “no relevant financial
relationships” received $2,361 in 2014 with $1,195 for the chemotherapeutic agent everolimus (Afinitor)
and $1,153 in 2015 with $995 for bevacizumab (Avastin). A chief editor that wrote entries on radiation
related topics listed “nothing to disclose” but received $143,359 in 2015 and 2016, the preponderance
(99.1%) from a company that produces radiation equipment (GE Healthcare). The 48 causes of death with
relevant matching articles had 155 unique authors (18.1% female) with thirty authors contributing to
multiple articles.
A regression analysis was completed to evaluate the correspondence between the CoI databases.
The total number of payments reported in PDD and CMSOP were examined. The R2 values were 0.997,
0.998, and 0.992 in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. The R2 values were 1.000, 0.999, and 0.998 in
2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively, for payment amounts (Supplemental Figure 1). These findings
indicate a very high agreement between CMSOP and PDD for both measures. The total amount received
was 0.016% or $590.23 higher in CMSOP ($3,684,068.23) than in PDD ($3,683,478) for 2013 to 2015.
Figure 1 depicts the total amount received for authors for drugs and causes of death for each year and
again shows substantial similarity between the CoI databases.
Two-complementary analyses were completed. First, a ranking of the ten highest compensated
articles, calculated as the sum of the compensation to one or more authors, is shown in Table 1. Oncology
articles occupied six of the ten highest rankings. Females accounted for five of these 39 authors (12.8%).
Additional examination was made with PDD among the authors who reported “Nothing to disclose”. A
Parkinson Disease author received compensation for a device used in assessing Parkinson’s, Datscan
Ioflupane ($4,071) and several Parkinson Disease pharmacotherapies (apomorphine: $15,462;
carbidopa/levodopa: $17,721; and rasagiline: $29,521) in 2015. A Type I diabetes author, who again

reported “Nothing to disclose”, received compensation for three drug treatments FDA approved for Type
II diabetes: dapgliflozin ($75), liraglutide ($26,100), and exenatide ($128,000) in 2015.
Second, disclosures were further examined among authors responsible for entries on the top ten
causes of death (N =31). Three-fifths of these authors (61.3%) were discordant in that they self-reported
no disclosures but had a PDD entry (total = $459,967 although 95.5% was from two-authors including the
diabetes author mentioned previously). Two-thirds of discordant authors (68.4%) received less than
$1,000 and the vast majority (84.2%) received less than $5,000. A non-small cell lung cancer author that
reported no relevant CoIs to Medscape was the recipient of $62,536 including $8,839 for the
chemotherapy palbociclib (Abraxane), $4,285 for pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and $2,365 for crizotinib
(Xalkori) in 2015.
Even among all authors with disclosures, there were appreciably less information provided in
their disclosures than in PDD. For example, a neurologist who co-authored the Parkinson Disease entry
listed only consulting when PDD noted $45,800 in Honoraria and $13,808 in travel and lodging in 2014
alone. PDD included $35,680 in 2015 for rasagiline but the corresponding manufacturer was not included
in the Medscape disclosure.

Discussion
There are several key findings in the study. Most authors reporting remuneration received from
pharmaceutical companies or medical device manufacturers did so accurately. However, inconsistencies
were occasionally noted. This discrepancy could result from the authors correctly interpreting that their
compensation was not relevant to the article. However, self-reporting CoI may in some cases also be
inadequate (Andreatos et al. 2017). Thirty-percent of the National Academy of Sciences report on
genetically engineered crops omitted a COI including research funding and patents (Krimsky & Schwab,
2017). Alternatively, the compensation may have been received outside of the temporal window of
reporting. The time-frame is challenging to determine because articles only provide info on when an
article was updated but not when it was originally written.
PDD provides a substantial level of detail about the specific medications where authors received
compensation. The neurologist who wrote the Parkinson’s article received over one-hundred thousand
dollars from companies related to Parkinson’s treatments and diagnosis. However, the majority of this
remuneration was related to antiepileptic drugs. The endocrinologist who wrote the diabetes article
received the preponderance of this compensation for anti-diabetes pharmacotherapies. It is currently
ambiguous whether compensation for a medicine for Type II diabetes would, or even should, be reported
in an article on Type I diabetes.
This investigation showed that PDD and CMSOP produced equivalent results in the number and
amount payments. Similarly, both PDD and CMPOP produced near identical outcomes in determining
whether an entry was present. This consistency may at least partially offset earlier criticisms (Babu et al.
2016). These databases just differ slightly in their interface and timeliness of updating. One minor
difference is that PDD rounds the payment to the dollar, whereas CMSOP shows the cent values as well.
Another difference is that CMSOP provides more recent information than PDD. Because PDD and
CMSOP are congruent with each other, this shows both databases have reliably compiled pharmaceuticalprovider transactions. Future quantitative bioethics research with a larger and more diverse (e.g. more

general practitioners) sample of physicians is needed to determine if PDD and CMSOP are functionally
equivalent.
Although not the main focus of this study, it did not escape notice that the vast majority of
authors of this influential content were male. The preponderance (88.9%) of the authors of the ten most
highly remunerated articles were male. Similarly, eight out of every nine authors of a widely used
pharmacology textbook, Goodman and Gilman’s Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, were male
(Piper et al. 2016). A substantial under-representation of female authors were also observed for
pathophysiology textbooks used to train allopathic or osteopathic physicians (Piper et al. 2018). Males
accounted for two-thirds of the recipients of the 2.4 billion in industry payments to US physicians. The
payment per physician was over-three fold larger for males ($5,031) then females ($1,390) (Triagle et al.
2017). Collectively, these findings point toward pronounced sex differences in physician-industry
interactions.
There is an awareness that the identification of inaccurately reported CoIs can be a sensitive. The
Leo-DeAngelis Lexapro episode involved a journal editor resisting transparency and engaging in
behaviors more appropriate of a public relations firm than of a leader in evidence based medicine
(DeAngelis & Fontanarosa, 2009; Leo & Lacasse, 2009; Melnick & Fugh-Berman, 2009). The intent of
this report was not to impugn the reputation of any individual or organization but instead to be able to
explore CoI disclosure accuracy and more critically evaluate the presented information. If there were
multiple authors who self-report “nothing to disclose” who are found to have received appreciable, recent
and relevant compensation, perhaps the point of care database should consider a direct link to the PDD
report. Failures to report CoI (e.g. Jose Baselga of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer) raises appreciable
concerns about the integrity of preclinical and clinical trial information (Miller, 2018). Authors and
editors at point of care information resources that engage in this practice risk impugning the faith of the
public and medical community in the integrity of their employers and should be subject to corrective
measures.

Three key limitations should be noted. Since only physicians are searchable in CoI databases,
pharmacists, scientists and nurse authors were not recorded nor compared. There is currently not a
thorough understanding of industry interactions among non-physicians. This may change beginning in
2022 with the national inclusion of physician assistants and advanced practice nurses (Stewart, 2018).
Second, the presence of potential CoI were appreciable. However, the goal of this study was not to
determine whether CoIs impacted information presentation. This medical information database is
presumed to be an unbiased site that the general public and clinicians use for medical advising. It reaches
a wide audience in part due to its nature as a freely available internet resource. If an author of a well-used
site is receiving funding from an outside company to advocate for a certain drug or treatment, this may
put clinicians and patients at risk of misguidance or receiving information that is incongruent with
evidence-based medicine. Self-reported CoIs, or their absence, should be interpreted with caution. There
is some subjectivity in what information to report. For example, the author of an article on Type I diabetes
may not believe that compensation related to a drug for Type II diabetes is relevant. The International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (2010) indicates that “You should disclose interactions with ANY
entity that could be considered broadly relevant to the work”. Third, the time-frame covered for
disclosures is also important. Because the database only provided information on when an article was
updated, but not originally written, we can not exclude the possibility that the original authorship may
have preceded the reported remuneration. However, as there are many biomedical developments, we can
only hope that the preponderance of content was from post-2012. Further, influential parties have been
known to be compensated in what appears to be a services first/pay-later pattern (Piller, 2018).
In conclusion, given the prevalence of potential CoIs, and occasional instances of inaccuracies,
further research systematically evaluating other point of care online resources (e.g. UpToDate) may be
warranted. At least based on this one database and examination of the ten highest remunerated articles,
self-reported financial CoIs were generally verified with PDD. This finding contradicts some prior
investigations (21, 28). However, the inconsistencies, while uncommon, suggest there is at least some

potential for improved transparency. Suggestions for point of care databases would be to develop shared
standards regarding the time period of reporting, a precise definition of “relevant” activities which would
result in disclosures, reporting at least the categories of compensation (e.g. $10-9,999; $10,000-99,999; >
$100,000), and developing procedures to mitigate potential bias. Modifications like these will insure that
public and health care provider trust in the integrity of these resources is preserved.
