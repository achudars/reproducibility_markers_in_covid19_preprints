What is known?
•

Studies have shown associations between poor health and adverse social (e.g. wellbeing,
social

contact)

and

socioeconomic

(e.g.

educational

attainment,

income,

employment)

outcomes, but there is also strong evidence that social and socioeconomic factors influence
health.

•

These bidirectional relationships make it difficult to establish whether health conditions and
health risk factors have causal effects on social and socioeconomic outcomes.

•

Mendelian randomization is a technique that uses genetic variants robustly related to an
exposure of interest (here, health conditions and risk factors for poor health) as a proxy for
the exposure.

•

Since genetic variants are randomly allocated at conception, they tend to be unrelated to
the factors that typically confound observational studies, and are less likely to suffer from
reverse causality, making causal inference from Mendelian randomization analyses more
plausible.

What this study adds
•

This study suggests causal effects of higher BMI, smoking and alcohol use on a range of
social and socioeconomic outcomes, implying that population-level improvements in these
risk

factors

may,

in

addition

to

the

well-known

health

benefits,

have

social

and

socioeconomic benefits for individuals and society.

•

There was evidence that asthma increased deprivation, decreased household income and
the chance of having a university degree, migraine reduced the chance of having a weekly
leisure

or

social

activity,

especially

in

men,

and

depression

increased

loneliness

and

decreased happiness.

•

There was little evidence for causal effects of cholesterol, systolic blood pressure or breast
cancer on social and socioeconomic outcomes.

Abstract
Objectives
To estimate the causal effect of health conditions and risk factors on social and socioeconomic
outcomes in UK Biobank. Evidence on socioeconomic impacts is important to understand because it
can

help

governments,

policy-makers

and

decision-makers

allocate

resources

efficiently

and

effectively.

Design
We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effects of eight health conditions (asthma,
breast cancer, coronary heart disease, depression, eczema, migraine, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes)
and

five

health

risk

factors

(alcohol

intake,

body

mass

index

[BMI],

cholesterol,

systolic

blood

pressure, smoking) on 19 social and socioeconomic outcomes.

Setting
UK Biobank.

Participants
337,009 men and women of white British ancestry, aged between 39 and 72 years.

Main outcome measures
Annual household income, employment, deprivation (measured by the Townsend deprivation index
[TDI]),

degree

level

education,

happiness,

loneliness,

and

13

other

social

and

socioeconomic

outcomes.

Results
Results suggested that BMI, smoking and alcohol intake affect many socioeconomic outcomes. For
example, smoking was estimated to reduce household income (mean difference = -£24,394, 95%
confidence interval (CI): -£33,403 to -£15,384), the chance of owning accommodation (absolute
percentage change [APC] = -21.5%, 95% CI: -29.3% to -13.6%), being satisfied with health (APC = 32.4%, 95% CI: -48.9% to -15.8%), and of obtaining a university degree (APC = -73.8%, 95% CI: -90.7%
to -56.9%), while also increasing deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.64,
approximately 236% of a decile of TDI). There was evidence that asthma increased deprivation and
decreased both household income and the chance of obtaining a university degree, and migraine
reduced

the

chance

of

having

a

weekly

leisure

or

social

activity,

especially

in

men.

For

other

associations, estimates were null.

Conclusions
Higher BMI, alcohol intake and smoking were all estimated to adversely affect multiple social and
socioeconomic outcomes. Effects were not detected between health conditions and socioeconomic
outcomes

using

Mendelian

randomization,

with

the

exceptions

of

depression,

asthma

and

migraines. This may reflect true null associations, selection bias given the relative health and age of
participants in UK Biobank, and/or lack of power to detect effects.

1. Background
Poor health has the potential to affect an individual’s ability to engage with society (1–4). For
example, illnesses or adverse health behaviours could influence the ability to attend and concentrate
at school or work and hence affect educational attainment, employment, and income. Illness and
health behaviours may also affect an individual’s ability to maintain wellbeing and an active social
life. From an individual perspective, maintaining good health can therefore have considerable social
and

socioeconomic

benefits

(5).

Similarly

from

a

population

perspective,

improving

population

health could lead to a happier and more productive population (6).

policy,

can

help

thereby

strengthening the case for cross-governmental action to improve health and its wider determinants
at the population-level (7). Furthermore, patients require accurate information about how their lives
might be affected by their health, for example on returning to work after cancer (8). However,
studying

the

social

and

socioeconomic

consequences

of

ill

health

(‘social

drift’)

is

challenging

because of social causation, i.e. the strong role of social and socioeconomic circumstances in disease
causation. Social causation means that associations between health and social and socioeconomic
outcomes are likely to be severely biased by confounding and reverse causality. Methodological
approaches strengthening causal inference in this field are therefore essential.

Mendelian randomization is a technique that uses genetic variants robustly related to an exposure
of interest (here, health conditions and risk factors for poor health) as proxies for the exposure
(instrumental variables) (9,10). Since genetic variants are randomly allocated at conception, results
from Mendelian randomization studies are much less likely to suffer from confounding and reverse
causality

than

traditional

observational

studies

(11).

In

this

paper,

we

apply

Mendelian

randomization within a large study of UK individuals aged between 39 and 72 years to estimate the
causal effects of health conditions and risk factors with the greatest burden on UK adults on a range
of social (e.g. social contact, wellbeing, and cohabitation status) and socioeconomic (e.g. education,
employment, income) outcomes.

2. Methods
Population
UK Biobank is a population-based health research resource consisting of approximately 500,000
people, who were recruited between the years 2006 and 2010 from 22 centres across the UK (12).
Participants provided medical history and socioeconomic information via questionnaires, interviews
and anthropometric measures at recruitment. Medical data from hospital episode statistics (HES)
and the cancer registry have been linked to participants. The study design, participants and quality
control

methods

have

been

described

in

detail

previously

(13–15).

UK

Biobank

received

ethics

approval from the Research Ethics Committee (REC reference for UK Biobank is 11/NW/0382).

We restricted analyses to unrelated individuals of white British ancestry. Full details of inclusion
criteria and genotyping are in

Supplementary Information 1.

After exclusions, 337,009 participants

remained in the dataset.

Measures of Health Conditions and Risk Factors (Exposures)
We used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD) (16) to identify health conditions and risk
factors that contributed 100 or more disability-adjusted life years lost per 100,000 adults in the UK.
From this list, we restricted our analysis to health conditions and risk factors with known genetic
determinants and a prevalence of ≥2% among UK Biobank participants. This resulted in the inclusion
of

eight

osteoarthritis

asthma,

cholesterol, smoking, systolic blood pressure (

and

coronary
five

risk

heart

factors:

eczema,

consumption,

BMI,

Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

Except for depression, we categorised a participant as having a health condition if they reported the
condition at the baseline visit, or if they had the corresponding HES or cancer registry ICD-9 or ICD10 code for the health condition before the baseline visit (ICD codes and specific questions used
shown in

Supplementary Table 1).

We coded depression as in Tyrrell (17), where participants were considered to have depression if
they self-reported seeing a GP or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety or depression and reported at least
a 2-week duration of depression or unenthusiasm, or had the relevant ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes for
depression. Participants were considered to not have depression if they did not report ever visiting a
GP or psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety or depression, did not self-report having depression and did
not have an ICD code for depression. Only 10 centres asked the questions related to depression, so
only participants from these centres were considered in the depression analyses.

The measurement of health risk factors is described in

Box 1.

Alcohol intake
We

estimated

the

average

weekly

intake

of

alcoholic

units

(10ml

of

pure

alcohol)

for

all

participants based on the average reported intake of six different types of alcoholic beverage. The
nominal number of units we assigned per drink for each type of alcoholic beverage are listed
below:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Red wine: 125 ml (6/bottle), 14% = 1.75 units
Champagne/white wine: 125 ml (6/bottle), 14% = 1.75 units
Beer/cider: 1 pint, 3.5% = 2 units
Spirits: 25 ml (25 standard measures in a normal sized bottle), 40% = 1 unit
Fortified wine: 60 ml (12/bottle), 20% = 1.2 units
Other: Unknown, example is an alcopop = 1 unit

We removed self-reported former drinkers, participants with a very high number of units per
week

(>200

units),

and

participants

who

did

not

report

they

were

never

drinkers

but

who

answered none of the questions about weekly alcohol intake, leaving 252,585 participants (75%).

Body mass index
BMI was

estimated

as measured

weight in

kilograms divided

by measured

height in

metres

squared.

Cholesterol
Cholesterol

was

measured

by

UK

Biobank

at

baseline

(measured

by

CHO-POD

analysis

on

a

Beckman Coulter AU5800).

Smoking
We used two measures of self-reported smoking.

Lifetime smoking index: a composite (continuous) measure of relevant smoking variables with a
simulated half-time constant representing the decreasing effect of smoking on health outcomes
over time. This variable was created by Wootton and colleagues and used in a paper studying
smoking and depression/schizophrenia (18).

Smoking initiation:

a

binary

measure

indicating

whether

participants

had

ever

versus

never

smoked participants, based on whether the lifetime smoking index value had a non-zero value.

Systolic blood pressure
Systolic blood pressure was measured using an automated device, and two measurements were
taken a few moments apart. If the

standard automated device could not be employed, two

manual readings were taken instead.

Polygenic Risk Scores (Instrumental Variables)
We

searched

previous

genome-wide

(GWAS)

for

single

nucleotide

polymorphisms (SNPs) with strong evidence of associations for each health condition and risk factor,

and

We considered breast cancer, coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, cholesterol or systolic blood
pressure unlikely to have plausible causal effects on the chance of obtaining a university degree
given that these health conditions usually occur later in life; the Mendelian randomization effect
estimates for these associations were thus used as negative controls (i.e. where no effect should be
expected) (20,21).

Main Mendelian Randomization Analysis
We

used

Mendelian

randomization

to

estimate

the

causal

association

between

each

health

condition and risk factor and each outcome, using the PRS as an instrumental variable, with age at
baseline assessment, sex, UK Biobank recruitment centre and 40 genetic principal components as
covariates. We used the ivreg2 package in Stata (version 15.1) with robust standard errors, and
tested for weak instrument bias (using Kleibergen-Paap Wald rk F statistics) to assess whether the
PRS

were

sufficiently

predictive

of

the

exposures

(23).

This

Mendelian

randomization

analysis

estimates mean and risk differences for continuous and binary outcomes respectively using additive
structural mean models (24–26). Mean differences are interpreted as the average change in the
outcome over all participants for having the exposure, and risk differences are interpreted as the
absolute percentage point change in proportion of participants with the outcome for having the
exposure (as in a linear probability model). For health conditions, we are measuring the effects of
genetic liability to the health condition (27). The analysis of breast cancer as an exposure was
restricted to women. Despite the limitations of an approach based on statistical significance (28), the
number of results generated in these analyses necessitated a decision about which results to present
in the main paper. Therefore, in the main table of results, we report results with a P value less than
0.0026 (a Bonferroni-corrected P value of 0.05 divided by 19 outcomes, with no correction for
multiple

exposures),

while

full

results

are

reported

in

supplementary

tables.

However,

we

considered the public health implications of all effect estimates when interpreting results.

To compare the Mendelian randomization results with associations from non-genetic analysis, we
estimated the multivariable adjusted associations between the exposures and outcomes using linear
regression, with age, sex, recruitment centre and 40 genetic principle components as covariates, i.e.
observational analyses without genetic

variables. These are linear probability models for binary

outcomes (rather than logistic regression models), which were necessary to be able to compare with
the Mendelian randomization analyses, as they are equivalent to additive structural mean models.

whether

the

estimates differed, where a

there

Sensitivity Analyses
The robustness of Mendelian randomization analyses is reliant on the assumption that the SNPs, and
therefore

PRS, do

not

affect

the

outcome

except

through

the

exposure, i.e.

the

SNPs are

not

pleiotropic. We tested this assumption by conducting sensitivity Mendelian randomization analyses,
including

inverse-variance

weighted

(IVW),

MR

Egger

(an

indicator

of

directional

pleiotropy),

weighted median, weighted mode and simple mode analyses (30–32). We also measured Cochran’s
Q statistic from the IVW analyses (a measure of heterogeneity in the effects of individual SNPs on
the outcome), an indicator of pleiotropy (33) or problems with modelling assumptions (34).

We also conducted split-sample GWAS and Mendelian randomization analysis using UK Biobank

each health condition and risk factor using the MRC IEU UK Biobank GWAS pipeline (35). The results
of the two GWAS were used to create PRS for the other half of UK Biobank avoiding sample overlap
(36), and we repeated the Mendelian randomization analysis with the two PRS separately, then
combined the two results with fixed-effect meta-analysis to give a single estimate. The split-sample
analysis a) allowed us to analyse lifetime smoking, as this has only been generated in UK Biobank,
and thus no previous GWAS could have been used to inform the PRS, b) allowed us to potentially
increase the size and power of the GWAS, possibly improving the predictive ability of the PRS and c)
guaranteed homogeneity of the GWAS and analysis populations, which removes the potential bias
from using data from an external GWAS to inform the creation of the PRS, for example, through
differences in populations giving different effects of SNPs. We also performed sensitivity Mendelian
randomization sensitivity analyses on each split to check the robustness of the split-sample results.

Supplementary Table 5

shows a summary of all PRS created and used in the split-sample analyses,

and all GWAS significant SNPs from the split-sample GWAS are detailed in

Supplementary Table 6.

Secondary Analyses
We conducted secondary analyses to check the robustness of results, looking at whether: a) results
are

different

by sex

and

deprivation

at birth, b)

results

for

household

income

are

affected

by

household size (income equivalisation), c) results for employment outcomes are different when
restricting to working age participants, d) results for household income are different when restricting
to participants who have not retired and e) results for smoking are robust when only looking at the
SNP rs1051730, known to affect smoking heaviness (37). Further information for the secondary
analyses and results are in

Supplementary Information 4.

In the main Mendelian randomization analysis, asthma was estimated to reduce household income
(mean difference =

-£13,519, 95% confidence interval

(CI): -£18,794 to

-£8,243), the chance of

obtaining a university degree (absolute percentage change [APC] = -17.0%, 95% CI: -25.3% to -8.7%),
and the chance of cohabiting (APC = -11.0%, 95% CI: -18.0% to -4.0%). There was little evidence
asthma affected other outcomes. Split-sample Mendelian randomization analysis estimates similarly
showed detrimental estimates of asthma on obtaining a university degree and income, but not on
cohabiting,

analyses for income. The multivariable adjusted association estimates tended to be weaker than the
Mendelian randomization estimates, and in some cases (e.g. the chance of obtaining a university
degree) in the opposite direction.

Depression
In the main Mendelian randomization analysis, depression was estimated to reduce satisfaction with
health (APC = -29.2%, -44.7% to -13.7%), financial situation (APC = -26.5%, 95% CI: -41.9% to -11.0%)
and family relationships (APC = -19.2%, 95% CI: -30.4% to -8.1%), and, as expected, reduce the
chance of being happy (APC = -19.1%, 95% CI: -28.3% to -9.8%) and increase the chance of being

There was evidence of heterogeneity in SNP effects for all outcomes, but no evidence of directional
pleiotropy from Egger regression. Multivariable adjusted association estimates tended to be weaker
than Mendelian randomization estimates.

Eczema
In the main Mendelian randomization analysis, eczema was estimated to reduce household income
(mean difference = -£46,987, 95% CI: -£71,048 to -£22,925). However, this was not observed in the
split-sample Mendelian randomization analysis (mean difference = £-6,774, 95% CI: £-25,198 to
£11,649) or multivariable adjusted analysis (mean difference = £157, 95% CI: £-544 to £859). CIs for
all other outcomes were very wide.

Migraine
In the main Mendelian randomization analysis, migraines were estimated to reduce the chance of
having a weekly leisure or social activity (APC = -43.7%, 95% CI: -66.0% to -21.3%). This estimate was
smaller in the split-sample Mendelian randomization (APC = -26.3% 95% CI: -57.7% to 5.1%) and

analyses (APC

in

Mendelian

randomization analyses were wide for all other outcomes. There was no evidence of pleiotropy.

Type 2 Diabetes
In the main and split-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, there were no strong associations
for type 2 diabetes with any outcome. Directions of effects were inconsistent across outcomes.
Multivariable adjusted association estimates tended to be larger than Mendelian randomization
estimates, and associations were apparent with several outcomes, most notably satisfaction with
health (APC for multivariable adjusted association estimate = -19.1%, 95% CI: -20.1% to -18.2%).

breast cancer and coronary heart disease, there was no clear pattern of the direction of effects
across outcomes, and CIs were wide. The CIs for osteoarthritis were very wide for all outcomes. As
expected, given life course temporal relationships, there was little evidence from the main or splitsample

that

or

osteoarthritis were associated with the chance of obtaining a university degree (included as negative
controls). In the multivariable adjusted analysis, breast cancer was not associated with the chance of

95% CI: -9.0% to -7.1% and APC = -6.3%, 95% CI: -6.9% to -5.6%, respectively), indicating, together
with the null estimates from the Mendelian randomization analyses, possible social causation of the
health conditions, rather than vice versa. Osteoarthritis was excluded from the sensitivity Mendelian
randomization

analysis as there

were

fewer

than

3 GWAS-significant SNPs in the

GWAS.

In the multivariable adjusted analysis, breast cancer was only associated with increased chances of
being non-employed and retired and a decreased satisfaction with health, whereas coronary heart
disease and osteoarthritis were negatively associated with all economic outcomes and most social
outcomes, though not satisfaction with friendships or work nor with weekly friend visits.

3.2 Risk Factors
Alcohol Intake
All results are expressed for a 5 units per week increase in alcohol intake.

In the main Mendelian randomization analysis, alcohol was estimated to reduce household income
(mean difference = -£2,111, 95% CI: -£3,093 to -£1,128) and the chance of owning accommodation
(APC = -1.7%, -2.4% to -1.0%), and increase deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.10
to 0.25, approximately 23% of a decile of TDI). In the split-sample Mendelian randomization analysis,
alcohol was estimated to reduce the chance of cohabiting (APC = -1.8%, 95% CI: -2.8% to -0.8%) and
owning accommodation

(APC = -0.9%,

95% CI: -1.5% to -0.3%) and increase

deprivation (mean

difference in TDI = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.19, approximately 16% of a decile of TDI). There was no
evidence of causal effects on other outcomes. There was evidence of heterogeneity in SNP effects
for some outcomes (not deprivation), but no evidence of directional pleiotropy in Egger regression.

-2.4% to -0.8%), being satisfied with health (APC = -5.1%, -6.8% to -3.5%), obtaining a university
degree (APC = -2.9%, 95% CI: -4.4% to -1.5%), and having a skilled job (APC = -2.2%, 95% CI: -3.5% to
-1.0%), and increase deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.33, approximately

situation (APC = -3.0%, 95% CI: -4.6% to -1.5%) and having a weekly leisure or social activity (APC = 4.6%, 95% CI: -5.8% to -3.4%).

There was evidence of heterogeneity in SNPs for all outcomes, but evidence of directional pleiotropy
in Egger regression only for obtaining a university degree. The multivariable adjusted associations
between

BMI

and

socioeconomic

outcomes

were

generally

consistent

with

the

Mendelian

randomization estimates.

Cholesterol
All results are expressed for a 1 mmol/litre increase in cholesterol.

In the main and split-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, there was no evidence of effects of
cholesterol on any outcome. In the multivariable adjusted analyses, cholesterol was beneficial for all
socioeconomic outcomes and most social contact and wellbeing outcomes, which, together with the
null estimates from the Mendelian randomization analyses, confounding or reverse causation in the
multivariable adjusted association estimates.

Lifetime Smoking
All results are expressed for a one standard deviation increase in the continuous lifetime smoking
index value. We did not perform a main Mendelian randomization analysis, as there was no previous
GWAS for lifetime smoking.

In the split-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, smoking was estimated to reduce household
income (mean difference = -£7,739, 95% CI: -£10,308 to -£5,170), the chance of cohabiting (APC = 5.3%, 95% CI: -8.7% to -1.9%), owning accommodation (APC = -8.7%, 95% CI: -10.9% to -6.6%),
having a skilled job (APC = -9.0%, 95% CI: -13.1% to -4.8%), obtaining a university degree (APC = 16.2%, 95% CI: -20.9% to -11.4%), and being satisfied with one’s financial situation (APC = -9.5%, 95%
CI: -14.3% to -4.8%) and health (APC = -8.3%, 95% CI: -13.2% to -3.4%). Lifetime smoking was also
estimate to increase deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.20, approximately
124% of a decile of TDI) and the chance of being non-employed, both with retired participants
included and excluded (APC = 4.1%, 95% CI: 2.0% to 6.2% and APC = 5.8%, 95% CI: 2.8% to 8.9%
respectively). There was little evidence smoking affected other social outcomes. There was evidence
of heterogeneity in SNPs for all outcomes, but evidence of directional pleiotropy in Egger regression
only for being satisfied with health and having a skilled job. Multivariable adjusted analyses showed
smaller estimates for all outcomes.

Smoking Initiation

analysis,

smoking

estimated

to

reduce

household income (mean difference = -£24,394, 95% CI: -£33,403 to -£15,384), the chance of owning

Smoking initiation was also estimated to increase the chance of having a skilled job (APC = -40.5%,

reduce the chance of being non-employed, both including and

excluding retired participants (APC = 13.0%, 95% CI: 5.7% to 20.3% and APC = 19.2%, 95% CI: 8.5% to
29.9% respectively), and of having weekly friend visits (APC = 21.1%, 95% CI: 9.7% to 32.5%), but
only in the main Mendelian randomization analysis. Additionally, smoking initiation was estimated to
reduce the chance of being satisfied with one’s financial situation (APC = -22.5%, 95% CI: -36.2% to 8.8%) in the split-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, with a similar effect size in the main

In the main and split-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, there was no evidence of effects of

alcohol intake and smoking all negatively affect socioeconomic outcomes, and depression negatively
affects many social outcomes. We do not observe an effect of cholesterol or systolic BP on any
outcome, which may reflect effective treatments for high cholesterol and hypertension protecting
participants from adverse consequences. For breast cancer, coronary heart disease, migraine and
osteoarthritis, the confidence intervals for all Mendelian randomization analyses were all very wide,
meaning

that

it

is

not

possible

to

draw

firm

conclusions

about

the

social

and

socioeconomic

consequences of these conditions from our analyses.

Potential

reasons

for

adverse

effects

of

high

BMI,

alcohol

use

and

smoking

on

social

and

socioeconomic outcomes include increased disease burden, social stigma (e.g. bias against obese
people, smokers etc.), or behaviours which make employment, retention of employment, or social
interaction challenging. Our previous analyses of UK Biobank have shown evidence of effects of BMI
on social and socioeconomic outcomes in both Mendelian randomization and non-genetic withinsibling analyses (38). Here, we build on these previous analyses by including a broader set of social
and

socioeconomic

outcomes,

conducting

additional

sensitivity

and

secondary

analyses,

and

facilitating comparisons across a range of health conditions and risk factors.

Higher

genetic

propensities

towards

asthma

and

eczema

were

estimated

to

reduce

household

income (mean difference = -£13,519, 95% CI: -£18,794 to -£8,243 for asthma, and mean difference =
-£46,987, 95% CI: -£71,048 to -£22,925 for eczema). However, it is possible these estimates are
susceptible to bias from pleiotropy, given the extreme size of the effects. Asthma and eczema share
many genetic loci, along with inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune conditions (39).
Therefore, the Mendelian randomization results for eczema and asthma may reflect an underlying
genetic predisposition toward autoimmune condition susceptibility, rather than asthma or eczema
specifically. This would not be detectable with Mendelian randomization sensitivity analyses if all
SNPs

included

in

the

PRS

were

affecting

autoimmune

susceptibility

rather

than

the

conditions

themselves (directional unbalanced pleiotropy). Additionally, the PRS for smoking initiation may
capture impulsivity and risk taking as well as a propensity to smoke.

For some health conditions (asthma, breast cancer, eczema, migraine), we saw little evidence for
observational (multivariable adjusted) associations with both socioeconomic and social outcomes,
despite prior

evidence often

showing strong associations. For example, breast cancer has been

associated with lower income

(40), but there was no observational association between breast

cancer and household income in UK Biobank. This could result from selection bias in UK Biobank
(41), with participants potentially liable to have less severe/advanced forms of the condition or
quicker recovery

than all breast cancer patients across a

population, and also

to have

greater

financial support and better employment conditions than the general population. The effects of
health conditions may also diminish over time; there is some evidence that the negative effect on
income amongst breast cancer survivors reduces over time (40). It is therefore possible our study
does not have the correct time frame to capture the effects of each health condition, or that wellfunctioning insurance markets and pension provision could mitigate socioeconomic effects of health
conditions, at least within this generally affluent UK population (42). Additionally, if a participant
developed any health condition after baseline, we would only know if the participant had a hospital
episode which mentioned the condition.

There was evidence that depression was detrimental to multiple social outcomes, including reduced
happiness, reported satisfaction rates, and increased loneliness. Given these are common features
of depression this result was expected and gives us confidence the PRS for depression was suitably
predictive of depression.

Strengths and Limitations
The main strengths of this analysis are that Mendelian randomization analyses are generally less
affected by confounding and reverse causation than multivariable adjusted (observational) analyses
(43), and that UK Biobank is a very large sample with sufficient data to enable us to examine multiple
health exposures and multiple socioeconomic and social outcomes. For some associations, there
were

marked

differences

between

the

Mendelian

randomization

and

multivariable

adjusted

association estimates, which could result from reverse causation or confounding in the multivariable
association

adjusted

estimates.

For

example,

coronary

heart

disease

was

associated

with

a

decreased chance of obtaining a university degree (APC = -8.1%, 95% CI: -9.0% to -7.1%) in the
multivariable adjusted analysis, which is implausible given coronary heart disease usually occurs
later

in

life

than

attending

university,

and

this

association

was

not

seen

in

the

Mendelian

randomization analysis. Additionally, the SNPs contributing to the PRS were drawn from GWAS that
excluded UK Biobank to avoid biases caused by sample overlap (36) and all reached genome-wide
significance. Finally, the results from the main and split-sample analyses were largely consistent
across exposures and outcomes, reducing the possibility of bias from differences in SNP effects
between the GWAS and UK Biobank populations.

However, Mendelian randomization rests on assumptions that cannot be proven to be true (43).
Assessing pleiotropy was difficult or impossible for many exposures, due to the low number of SNPs
and wide CIs, but there was evidence for heterogeneity between SNPs for some associations (e.g. for
income), and directional pleiotropy from Egger regression for a limited number of associations (e.g.
for BMI on obtaining a university degree). As the outcomes were social and socioeconomic, not
biological, the exclusion restriction assumption would be strong for any genetic variant (i.e. that the
genetic variant affects the outcome only through the exposure). For example, we cannot assume
that a SNP associated with income affects any health condition or risk factor solely through income.
We therefore did not perform bi-directional Mendelian randomization (44), and so cannot rule out
reverse causation for any analysis.

The

PRS

lifetime

or

factor,

and

interventions to reduce the exposure or risk of the exposure at different time points in a person’s life
may have different effects; effects at specific points in life cannot be explored with the methodology
used in this paper. As we used linear prediction models for all analyses, some effect estimates may
also be impossibly large (i.e. over 100%), which could occur when precision is very low, though this
was rare. Although Mendelian randomization is generally less affected by confounding and reverse
causality than multivariable regression

effects.

Recent

analyses, an important potential
evidence

suggests

that

source of bias in these

assortative

and

dynastic

effects can lead to bias in Mendelian randomization effect estimates (45), with estimates of the
effect of BMI on educational attainment being consistent with the null in within-family Mendelian
randomization models using data from UK Biobank and the Norwegian HUNT study. In our previous
analysis of UK Biobank (38), within-family Mendelian randomization models in UK Biobank alone
were too imprecise to draw conclusions about whether the estimated effects of BMI on social and
socioeconomic outcomes are robust to potential confounding by family-level factors. Since BMI is
the exposure for which we

have greatest statistical power (due to the strength of the

genetic

instrumental variable), we have not repeated the within-family analyses for our other exposures as

limited. However, as more

available

that include

information for multiple family members, examination of whether these effects can be detected
with a within-family Mendelian randomization design will be a high priority.

UK Biobank, while large, is not representative of the UK population

as participants tend to be

wealthier and healthier compared to the country as a whole, which may impart bias to our analyses
(46). It is likely this biased some estimates towards the null, as wealthier and healthier people may
be more resistant to any detrimental effects of health conditions and risk factors. Additionally, there
is evidence of a geographic structure in the UK Biobank genotype data that cannot be accounted for
using adjustment for principal components, which may also have biased our analyses (47). Some
outcomes

were

dichotomised,

which

may

have

reduced

our

ability

to

detect

associations

(e.g.

satisfaction with health).

For health conditions, the uncertainty around the Mendelian randomization effect estimates was
large. As many health conditions had small associations with outcomes on multivariable adjusted
analyses, this often meant the Mendelian randomization estimates were larger than the observed
estimates or had a different sign, but this can be explained by the imprecision in the Mendelian
randomization estimates. The uncertainty is due in part to the relatively poor ability of the PRS to
predict some health conditions. There were minimal differences in prevalence between UK Biobank
and the UK for most health conditions studied (apart from migraine and depression, which were less
and more prevalent in UK Biobank respectively), but it is possible the health conditions were milder
or

better-managed

UK

Therefore, null results should be interpreted as a lack of evidence for a causal effect, not evidence of
a lack of a causal effect.

5. Conclusion
The

results

of

this

study

imply

that

higher

BMI,

smoking

and

alcohol

consumption

are

likely

detrimental to socioeconomic outcomes. While the prevalence of smoking is decreasing in the UK
(49), the average BMI has risen and is continuing to rise worldwide (50). Reducing average BMI
levels, and further reducing smoking and alcohol intake, in addition to health benefits, may also
improve socioeconomic outcomes for individuals and populations.

There was little evidence of causal effects of health conditions on socioeconomic outcomes, which
may

reflect
