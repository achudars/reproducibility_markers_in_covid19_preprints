Abstract
Background
Research infrastructure such as patient registries and biobanks is expected to play important
roles by aggregating information and biospecimens to promote research and development for
rare diseases. However, both building and maintaining them can be costly. This paper
presents results of a survey of patient registries for rare diseases in Japan conducted at the end
of 2012, with emphasis on clarifying costs and efforts related to building and maintaining
them.
Results
Of 31 patient registries in Japan found by searching a database of research grant reports and
by searching the internet, 11 returned valid responses to this survey. Results show that labor
and IT system costs are major expenses for developing and maintaining patient registries.
Half of the respondent patient registries had no prospect of securing a budget to maintain
them. Responders required the following support for patient registries: financial support,
motivation of registrants (medical doctors or patients), and improved communication with
and visibility to potential data users. These results resemble those reported from another
survey conducted almost simultaneously in Europe (EPIRARE survey).
Conclusions
Survey results imply that costs and efforts to build and maintain patient registries for many
rare diseases make them unrealistic. Some alternative strategy is necessary to reduce burdens,
such as offering a platform that supplies IT infrastructure and basic secretariat functions that
can be used commonly among many patient registries.

Introduction
Grasping an overview of a single rare disease is difficult because of the lack of sufficient
information related to it. That difficulty inhibits proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment,
while impeding the progress of research related to that disease. Patient registries and biobanks
are expected to alleviate some difficulties by gathering dispersed information and
biospecimens and thereby drive rare disease research [Lopez et al. 2016].

Patient registries are usually intended for long-term operation. However, understanding how
much effort is necessary to develop and maintain them is difficult. Several good reviews and
recommendations written by experts in the field of rare diseases and patient registries have
been published on this topic to date [Richesson & Vehik 2010; RDTF 2011; EUCERD 2013].
They include points that should be considered in establishing patient registries. New
developers of rare disease patient registries can refer to this literature, but it does not include
precise information that developers often demand. Sharing experiences of building and
maintaining existing patient registries would be useful not only for future patient registries but
also for existing patient registries. In Europe, the European Platform for Rare Diseases
Registries (EPIRARE) project, 2011–2013 [EPIRARE] administered a large-scale online
survey targeted mainly at patient registries in Europe (the EPIRARE Survey [EPIRARE
Survey]) and published the results in 2013 [EPIRARE 2013]. The EPIRARE Survey asked
about major needs of patient registries, ways to address various (methodological, technical,
and regulatory) issues, and ways to find resources (technological tools, specific expert advice,
model documents, and quality control systems) to develop and sustain patient registries.
Reportedly, rare disease patient registries in Europe reported that their major needs include 1)
gathering financial support, 2) motivating participants (data providers), 3) assessing data

quality, and 4) improving communication and visibility of the obtained results.

This paper reports the results of a survey of rare disease patient registries in Japan conducted
in 2012, which specifically addressed highlighting challenges that researchers face in
constructing and maintaining patient registries of rare diseases, aiming at providing basic
information that would be referred by existing and future patient registries.

Methods
Respondent selection
A list of potential survey participants was developed from a structured search of published
sources through Google and the MHLW Grants System [MHLW Grants System], a database
of research projects granted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan
after 1997. When this survey was conducted, system users could search only the titles and
abstracts of research reports submitted to the MHLW. Database searches using Japanese
equivalent terms of “patient registry” were applied to the MHLW Grants System and Google.
For all search results from the MHLW Grants System, we read abstracts of research reports to
confirm the description that a patient registry(s) was constructed in the study. This process
took place during August–October 2012.

From this search procedure, 31 potential patient registries in Japan were identified (26 from
the MHLW Grants System and 5 from Google). Because only insufficient information can be
captured from the title and abstract of research reports recorded in the MHLW Grants System,
in most cases we were unable to ascertain the subject diseases of the potential patient
registries. Therefore, the candidate list from the MHLW Grants System might include patient

registries targeting non-rare diseases.

Questionnaire management
A postal questionnaire with a request letter and a self-addressed envelope was sent to all of
these potential patient registries in November 2012. Several days after the questionnaire sent,
a phone call was made to ensure the arrival of the questionnaire. One month after the
questionnaire was sent out, a reminder was sent to each addressee. To shed light on issues and
challenges in building and sustaining rare disease patient registries in Japan, the following
categories of questions were included: general characteristics of registries, registration
method of patients, operating organization of registries, the budget for building, and
sustaining registries.

Results
Respondent characteristics
Of the 31 subjects surveyed, 13 returned their questionnaires. Of those respondents, 11
completed the questionnaires. Two reported that registries had not been constructed. Of the 11
patient registries, 6 were for rare diseases, and 5 were for common diseases. Among the six
respondent patient registries for rare diseases, three registries were established in 2009. Also,
one registry was established in each of 2007, 2010, and 2011. Half of the six registries’
respondents reported that they have been cooperating with foreign registries or international
networks.

The objectives of the registries are presented in Table 1. Epidemiological surveys were
included in the objectives of all registries. The objectives related to diagnosis and treatment of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19004770; this version posted August 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

the target diseases were considered by more than half of the registries. One objective related
to drug development, “clinical trial of drug or medical device,” was considered by more than
half of the registries, although “post-marketing surveillance of drug or medical device” and
“market survey of drug or medical device” were considered by only one registry. The
objectives related to a patient's daily life, “evaluation of the quality of medical care,”
“evaluation of economics of medical care,” and “survey of the living condition of patients,”
were considered by only one or no registry. Registries 1 and 6 narrowed the objectives,
although registries 3, 4, and 5 covered a wide ranges of objectives.

Registration method of patients
For three out of six respondent registries, medical doctors register in the registry under a
patient's consent. For the other three registries, patients or their representatives register
directly. Registration is available only by postal mail in four respondent registries, only
through the internet in one registry, and by both ways in one registry.

Operating organization of registries
Offices of the patient registries were located in medical or research institutions for four
registries, in a patients' association in for one registry, and in a private company for one
registry. The numbers of total staff in registry offices were 1, 4, 8, and 10 for four registries,
and 6 for two registries. The numbers of full-time staff were 0 for three registries, and 1, 2, or
4 for each other registry.

Budget for building and sustaining registries
The total budgets for establishing and maintaining each patient registry are presented in Table

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19004770; this version posted August 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

2. For both establishment costs and maintenance cost of the preceding year, 3 of 6 respondent
registries spent between 1 million and 5 million JPY (almost 10,000 and 50,000 EUR), 2
registries spent between 5 million and 10 million JPY (almost 50,000 and 100,000 EUR), and
1 registry spent between 10 million and 50 million JPY (almost 100,000 and 5,000,000 EUR).
In the EPIRARE survey, the number of registries with yearly budget up to 100,000 EUR was
74 (36.8% of total of 201 respondents) and that with higher than 100,000 EUR was 36
(17.9%) [EPIRARE Survey]. JPY stands for Japanese Yen and EUR stands for Euro.
Maintenance costs were of the prior year. The yearly average exchange rate in 2012 between
JPY and EUR was 1 EUR to 102.13 JPY, calculated as the average between the Yearly
Average Telegraphic Transfer Selling rate (TTS) and the Yearly Average Telegraphic
Transfer Buying rate (TTB) obtained from the final official quotation by the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) [MURC].

The Top 3 funding and expense items for establishing each patient registry are presented in
Table 3a and Table 4a. Four of the six registries listed the public research grant from Ministry
of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) as the top funding items in establishment of the
patient registry. This result reflects that many medical studies are funded by this grant, and
also that the MHLW Grants System and Google were used to search patient registries in this
study. The other two registries listed financial assistance from the administering organization
at the top 1. One registry listed donations; another registry listed research and funding by the
university as the top 2. For expense items in establishment of the patient registry, the labor
costs and information technology (IT) system construction costs were included in the top 2 in
most registries. All registries listed one of these two items at the top 1. All except for one
registry listed the remainder of them in the top 2. Many registries listed equipment and
supplies expenses among the top 3, but no registry listed office expenses and energy (light,

fuel and water) expenses within the top 3.

The top 3 funding and expense items for maintaining each patient registry were presented in
Table 3b and Table 4b. The research grant from MHLW was also the major funding item in
maintaining the patient registries as well as in establishing them. However, because this grant
funding expires typically in several years, it can not be regarded as a permanent funding
source. Therefore, major funding items for maintaining patient registries after years can differ
according to patient registries. Most patient registries included labor costs and IT system
maintenance costs among the top 2 expenses for maintaining patient registries. One patient
registry did not include labor costs. Two patient registries did not include IT system
maintenance costs among the top 3 expenses.

When the patient registries started, none of their founders planned to maintain the registries
for only a short term (several years). One patient registry was scheduled to review the
operational plan every two years. One patient registry was planned for a certain period of time
(20 years). The remaining four were planned or sought to maintain for an unlimited period
(Table 5). Of five registries that were planned to operate for a long time, three answered that
they had no prospect of securing a budget in the future (Table 6).

Ideas and difficulties in building and sustaining patient registries
Finally, the questionnaire asked respondents to answer, by free description, questions related
to 1) ingenuity and attention, 2) difficulty and anxiety, and 3) other free comments for
building and maintaining each patient registry.

For ingenuity and attention, efforts of three kinds were raised from the respondents. The first

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19004770; this version posted August 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

type of answer was to endeavor to reduce burdens on registrants (medical doctors and
patients) to register through keeping the number of follow-up surveys to once a year,
including a reply envelope with survey form, or offering a toll-free phone number of the
registration office. The second type was to achieve understanding of the importance of
registration through organizing lecture meetings throughout the country, sending feedback
and disclosing information to registrants and registry users such as researchers at public
institutions or private companies, or carefully gathering feedback from them. The last type
was to improve the number of registrations and persistence rates of registration through
cooperation with patient groups and medical doctors throughout the country, or continually
showing the passion of the head researcher of the registry by regularly sending letters or
e-mails.

Regarding difficulty and anxiety, answers of five kinds were received. The first were related
to securing a continuous budget. When the patient registry budget depends heavily on public
grants from government ministries, the research group that manages the registry must apply
for the grant every several years. It is therefore difficult for patient registries to establish
stable and sustainable operation. The second were related to managing the burdens of the
registration bureau. Continuing patient registry is currently dependent on the ambition and
responsibility of the head researcher of the registry because of a lack of sufficient government
support. Breaks in public research grants occurring every several years request a change of
the head and members of the research group, which makes it difficult to continue the patient
registry. The third is about inspiring the cooperation of medical doctors at small hospitals or
clinics. For some rare diseases, patients visit neighboring hospitals unless facing serious
matters, but most doctors in such small-scale hospitals have insufficient time and capacity to
fill in registration forms for the patient. The fourth is related to use of the data in the registry.

Data in patient registries are expected to be used for the research and development of new
drugs at private companies. That is a major aim of patient registries. However, it has not yet
occurred for most patient registries. The last is about taking the balance between the amount
of information and the number of registrants. More numbers and variety of items in the
registration form give more information related to the disease and patients with the disease,
although it gives lower enrollment numbers and renewal rates in registration because of
increasing burden of filling in the registration form.

Regarding other free comments, some opinions were offered to indicate the future directions
of patient registries. 1) Versatile web-based registration systems, on which many research
groups can construct their patient registry, are necessary to reduce the burdens of constructing
and maintaining patient registries. 2) There should be ways and means to use dormant patient
registries that have been closed by budget shortages. 3) Target diseases, research into which
the public resources are injected, should be emphasized. Many of them remain more or less
unknown. 4) A trend shifting from a doctor-centered patient registry to a patient-centered one
is expected to change the current undesirable circumstances related to the patient registry. 5)
It would be better to try to introduce a new support scheme to achieve budgets for
maintaining patient registries from pharmaceutical industry groups.

Discussion
Results of this survey highlight current efforts and needs for developing and maintaining
patient registries for rare diseases in Japan. This report is the first of a survey on this topic
conducted in Japan. Although the respondents were few, qualitative tendencies were observed
in terms of the results.

Some patient registries have no website. Therefore an internet search of patient registries is
insufficient to find them, but the methodology used in this survey, using not only an internet
search but also a database of grant-funded projects, is expected to address that limitation. The
total number of rare disease patient registries in Japan is assumed to be small. Therefore,
efforts for increasing the response rate will be important for future surveys.

The years of foundation of the patient registries to which the questionnaires were sent were
distributed throughout 1997–2011, although those of the respondents were 2007–2011. It is
not certain but probable that all or most patient registries established before 2007 were unable
to sustain their activities beyond five years.

Objectives of patient registries
Most respondents selected choices related to getting an overview and insight into diseases as
objectives of the patient registries, although few selected ones related to ascertaining the real
conditions of patients with diseases in their daily life, to assess the quality of medical care, or
to research markets for drugs. This trend is the same as that in the case of Europe. In the
EPIRARE survey [EPIRARE 2013], 70.8% of the respondent patient registries chose
“epidemiological research” as the aim of the registry, although 33.3% chose “treatment
monitoring” and 19.2% chose “social planning”.

Drugs and medical devices can improve the life experiences of patients. To achieve that
improvement continuously, promotion of industry–government–academia cooperation would
play an important role. The MHLW in Japan proposed “Clinical Innovation Network (CIN)”
in 2015 as a new scheme for collaboration among six National Centers (NCs) for Advances
and Specialized Medical Care affiliated with the MHLW and pharmaceutical companies. In

this scheme, the NCs are presumed to construct patient registries as infrastructure to promote
drug development [MHLW 2015]. The CIN would serve as a test of the patient registry for
drug development.

Structure and costs for operation
Half of the respondent patient registries chose "1,000,000–5,000,000 JPY" as the total
expense for building and maintaining patient registries. The second most common answer was
"5,000,000–10,000,000 JPY". Expense items were budgets for labor, IT systems, and office
supplies in descending order. In the EPIRARE survey, the most common answer to the
question “Average yearly budget over three years” was "<50,000 EUR" (23.8% of
respondents chose it). The third most common answer was "51,000–100,000 EUR" (13.4%).
Fifty thousand EUR was about 51 million JPY in 2012, trends in yearly budgets were similar
between Europe and Japan, except that the second most common answer was "No funds"
(22.3%) in the EPIRARE survey.

Half of the respondent patient registries employ one or more full-time staff members. All
employ part-time staff members. Although contents of work probably vary greatly according
to each registry, some or most of them can be commonalized. If it were achieved, then patient
registries could share staff members, which will engender reduction of the total cost.

Of the six respondents, two answered that their patient registries use web-based registration
forms. One of them uses both the web-based and paper-based forms. Although the web-based
registration form has several beneficial features, some registrants (patients or medical doctors)
do not use the internet, some medical doctors are unable to connect the internet from their
offices because of security policy, and the web-based registration form is expensive. It is

necessary to reduce the cost of web-based forms to increase the adoption of web-based forms
by, for example, sharing web-based systems among many patient registries.

Future directions of rare disease patient registries
From free descriptions, important needs were extracted: obtaining funds, reducing operational
burdens, gaining cooperation from participants (patients and medical doctors), promoting
utilization of stored data, and so forth. These were similar to those reported from the
EPIRARE survey, which elucidated frequent needs as financial support, strengthened
motivation of data providers, data quality assessment, improvement of communication, and
visibility of the results obtained. Here, we propose three cooperative efforts to address these
issues.

First, a possible effort to reduce burdens related to constructing and maintaining patient
registries is building a common platform that offers universal facilities such as IT
infrastructure and secretariat functions. Many tasks are not specific to each patient registry.
They might be outsourced or shared with many other registries. Such efforts would have a
strong effect on expenses for constructing and maintaining patient registries because the IT
infrastructure and labor cost are major expense items.

Second, patient registries should mutually collaborate in engaging in educational activities to
increase awareness of the importance of patient registries. Public attitudes about participation
in biobanks have a correlation with awareness of existence and the purpose of biobanks
[Gaskell & Gottweis 2011]. Attitudes related to patient registries can show the same trend.
Improved public awareness of patient registries is expected to increase the number of
participants and the ratio of participants who engage continuously in patient registries and

also increase the users of data stored in patient registries.

In Japan, a new law for medical care for patients with rare and intractable diseases was
implemented on January 1, 2015. Based on this law, Japan's MHLW has developed the rare
and intractable diseases registry database to collect medical information of patients in Japan
with rare diseases that are specified in this law. This registry is expected to improve the
current circumstances. Data in this registry would be used for various purposes, although
some researchers will continue to try to develop their own patient registries for purposes that
are not accomplished with the MHLW's registry and for diseases that are not included in the
MHLW's registry.

Third, a new scheme is expected to be introduced to secure a sufficient budget from
collaboration between academia and industry to maintain patient registries. Data stored in
patient registries is not necessarily useful and attractive for pharmaceutical companies and
medical device companies because objectives to organize patient registries vary. However,
founders of patient registries should devote more attention to supporting the development of
new drugs and medical devices because they will have the potential to change a patient’s life
drastically. Patient registries should consider collecting data that will attract researchers in
academia but also those in industry at the planning phase in terms of increasing the use of
data stored in registries and in terms of expanding the range of the sources of supporting
funds.

As described previously, CIN was started in 2015 as a new collaboration framework between
academia and industry to encourage drug discovery and development. It is drawing attention
as a new framework for the use of patient registries.

Conclusions
Survey results imply that costs and efforts to build and maintain patient registries for many
rare diseases make them unrealistic. Some alternative strategy is necessary to reduce burdens,
such as offering a platform that supplies IT infrastructure and basic secretariat functions that
can be used commonly among many patient registries.
