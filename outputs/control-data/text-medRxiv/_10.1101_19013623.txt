ABSTRACT
A common genetic variant near MBOAT7 (rs641738C>T) has been previously
associated with hepatic fat and advanced histology in non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), however, these findings have not been consistently
replicated in the literature. Therefore, we aimed to establish whether rs641738
is a risk factor for NAFLD through meta-analysis. Data from 131,096
participants (7,692 with liver biopsies and 45,419 with imaging) was included
in the meta-analysis. The minor T-allele of rs641738C>T was associated with
higher liver fat on CT/MRI using an additive genetic model (+0.05 standard
deviations [95% CI: 0.01 – 0.09], p=0.025), and with an increased risk of

NAFLD (per-allele OR: 1.09 [95% CI: 1.01 - 1.17]), nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.02 - 1.21]), advanced fibrosis (OR: 1.14
[95% CI: 1.05 - 1.23]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR: 1.43 [95% CI: 1.22
- 1.67]) in adults with NAFLD. Sub-group analysis did not demonstrate a
difference in Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Rs641738C>T was not
associated with markers of insulin resistance but was associated with higher
risk of stroke in the UK Biobank. These data validate rs641738C>T near
MBOAT7 as a risk factor for the development, activity, and stage of NAFLD
including hepatocellular carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION
Since the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of liver fat (1), more
than 20 genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have been associated with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)(2). These studies have deepened
our understanding of the condition, its heritability, and its relationship with
cardio-metabolic disease.

Rs641738C>T near MBOAT7 (membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain
containing 7) was initially identified as a genome-wide significant risk locus for
alcohol-related cirrhosis(3). It has since been implicated in the pathogenesis
of NAFLD(4), hepatocellular carcinoma(5), as well as in fibrosis development
in chronic hepatitis B and C.

This SNV is located a few hundred base pairs downstream of the 3’
untranslated region of MBOAT7, which belongs to a family of genes that code
for specific acyl donors and acceptors. MBOAT7 encodes
lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), which contributes to the
regulation of free arachidonic acid in cells(6). Rs641738C>T is associated
with lower hepatic expression of MBOAT7 at both the mRNA(7) and protein
level(4). Given its role in inflammatory lipid pathways, most mechanistic work
relating to rs641738 has focused on MBOAT7.

In NAFLD, the rs641738 variant was first demonstrated to be associated with
increased hepatic fat content and severity of fibrosis in individuals of
European descent(4). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy data from

2736 individuals showed a modest increase in hepatic fat in those with TTgenotype (4.1%) compared to those with CT- (3.6%) or CC-genotype (3.5%)
(p=.005). Follow-up studies of European subjects corroborated the initial
findings, and suggested a role in development of hepatocellular
carcinoma(8,9). However, these results were not replicated in adults of other
genetic ancestries(4,10–12) or in children(13). It is recognised that
investigation of candidate genes in relatively small cohorts can generate falsepositive findings(14).
In addition, biallelic loss of function mutations in MBOAT7 cause autosomal
recessive mental retardation 57 (OMIM #617188) and no liver phenotype has
been reported in these patients to date(15), however, rare likely pathogenic
variants in MBOAT7 are associated with HCC in NAFLD(16). In summary, the
association between rs641738 and hepatic fat content, as well as its effects
on severity of NAFLD, remain unclear. Moreover, the broader metabolic
effects of this SNV, including its association with diabetes and cardiovascular
outcomes, have not been assessed.

Here, we conducted a large meta-analysis of published and unpublished data
to determine if rs641738 influences the development or stage of NAFLD and
associated cardio-metabolic phenotypes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data sources and study selection
Two data sources were included in the meta-analysis: published studies (and
abstracts) and unpublished GWAS (or targeted genotyping) data.

Published studies were sourced through Medline and Embase using the
search terms “(MBOAT7 or membrane-bound-o-acyltransferase) or (rs641738
or rs626283) or (TMC4)”. There were no restrictions on date or language, and
the study selection included all original studies including AASLD Liver Meeting
and EASL meeting abstracts. The search was completed on 1st October 2019.
Reference lists of relevant publications were also reviewed. Titles and
abstracts were screened for eligibility independently by two authors, with
inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to potentially eligible full texts.

A search was conducted for all GWAS in NAFLD, NASH, and steatosis.
Authors of all potentially relevant GWAS were contacted to request extraction
of data regarding rs641738C>T. To assess for cardiometabolic phenotype
associations, Phenoscanner(17) and GeneATLAS(18) were searched for
summary statistics from published GWAS.

HuGENet guidelines were followed throughout. This study was prospectively
registered on PROSPERO Database of Systemic Reviews
(CRD42018105507) Available from:

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Cohort and case-control studies related to NAFLD were included if genotyping
of rs641738C>T (or other SNVs in linkage disequilibrium [LD, R2>0.8]) was
conducted and data on one of the outcomes of interest were reported. Review
articles, in vitro studies, and investigations involving animal, fish, and
invertebrates were excluded. Studies which investigated liver disease of other
etiologies were also excluded.

Data collection
For each study, data on participant demographics (sex, age, ethnicity) were
collated. Hepatic steatosis or NAFLD (as diagnosis) was evaluated as a
dichotomous variable where radiological assessment (liver ultrasound,
controlled attenuation parameter [CAP, with cut-off >240m/s], CT, MRI) were
used. Hepatic fat content (from CT, MRS, MRI, PDFF), serum lipid profile,
fasting insulin, and alanine aminotransferase levels were collected as
continuous variables. Hepatic fat content was also assessed using semiquantitative scoring in the Fenland cohort, as previously described(19), and
using CAP. Histology data were extracted according to the NASH Clinical
Research Network scoring system and, where not otherwise diagnosed by a
pathologist’s assessment, NASH was defined using the Fatty Liver Inhibition
of Progression (FLIP) algorithm. The above data were collected for each
genotype separately (CC, CT, and TT).

Phenoscanner was used to assess for disease associations with
rs641738C>T at P<0.01. Phenotype associations were filtered for those
related to cardio-metabolic and liver disease.

The authors of 21 published studies were contacted for additional data, all of
whom replied. Several studies reported outcomes from overlapping cohorts:
ref (4) and ref (20); ref (9) and ref (21). In these instances, data only from the
larger of the overlapping cohorts were included in analyses.

Cohorts with genome-wide data
The authors of 9 potentially relevant GWAS (and cohort studies with genomewide data) were contacted, of which 8 replied and data were included from 6.
These cohorts have been described elsewhere(1,22–24). Densely imputed
genotyping data were available for rs641738C>T in all with >0.98 call rate.
Unpublished data from Wilman et al.(25) was extracted from the UK BioBank
under Application ID 9914 (‘Determining the Outcomes of People with Liver
Disease’).

Study quality assessment
Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias in each study by applying
the Cochrane Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies tool.

Statistical Analysis:

For dichotomous outcomes, the effect statistic was calculated as an odds ratio
between groups. Genetic association analyses were performed using an
additive model to estimate the effect per T-allele as almost all included studies
had used this model.
For analysis of effect on liver fat, data were inverse normalized and an
additive genetic model (coding the number of T alleles as 0, 1, and 2) was
used with linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, and principal components
of genetic ancestry (where available). In addition, data from the GOLD
Consortium were adjusted for number of alcoholic drinks consumed.
Continuous quantitative liver fat data (from CT, MRI, MRS, or PDFF) and
semi-quantitative data (ultrasound and CAP) were analyzed separately.
For other continuous variables, effect summary was calculated as a mean
difference between CC and TT groups.
Meta-analysis was performed using random effects throughout.
Summary statistics were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data
from paediatric and adult studies were analyzed separately. Sub-analysis was
performed using only studies with Caucasian (Non-Finnish or Finnish
European ethnicity) where data were available from at least four studies. This
sub-analysis was selected due to initial identification of this variant in
Caucasian individuals, further sub-analysis by ethnicity may be affected by
differences in linkage disequilibrium between genetic ancestries.
Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed for all outcomes using
additive model of inheritance and random effects.
Heterogeneity between groups was described using the Q statistic and I2.

Bias was assessed using Egger’s test and visually using funnel plots where
more than 5 studies were included. P <0.025 (i.e. P<0.05/2) was considered
statistically significant due to testing outcomes twice: in individuals of all
ethnicities and Caucasians only. Analysis was performed using STATAv14 for
Windows (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College
Station, TX: StataCorp LP), DistillerSR Forest Plot Generator from Evidence
Partners (https://evidencepartners.com/resources/forest-plot-generator/),
GraphPad Prism (v8.0 for Mac, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California, USA),
and MetaGenyo(26).

<Table 1.>

In total, 131,096 individuals (4,174 children) were included in the metaanalysis. Most studies were in adults (23/30, 77%) and in individuals of
European ancestry (20/30, 67%). Of the 30 included studies, 15 (totaling
7,692 unique participants, hereof 345 children) reported data on liver
histology.

Liver fat, NAFLD, and severe steatosis in adults
Seven studies (21,924 participants) reported data on hepatic fat as a
continuous variable assayed by CT or MR(1,20,25,35,41,43). In meta-analysis
across these seven studies, rs641738 was associated with increased liver fat,
with a per T-allele increase of 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 - 0.09) standard deviations in
inverse normalized liver fat (Figure 1). There was significant heterogeneity
between studies with I2 = 67% and Tau2=.002. This trend of association
remained on sub-analysis including only cohorts with Caucasian (European)
ethnicity (Supplementary Figure 2).

Data from 8 studies (82,857 adults, 6,787 with liver biopsy data) were
included in meta-analysis of fibrosis. Our primary outcome, presence of
advanced fibrosis in adults (stage F0-2 versus stage F3-4), was positively
associated with T-allele (OR 1.14 (95% 1.05, 1.23), Figure 4A) in adults.
Sensitivity analysis, including omission of coded cirrhosis data from Emdin et
al.(39), did not alter the effect summary (Supplementary figure 8). Presence of
any fibrosis (stage 0 versus stage 1-4) was also positively associated with
rs641738C>T (OR 1.14 (95% 1.01, 1.28), Figure 4B). On sub-analysis of
Caucasian individuals, rs641738C>T was associated with advanced fibrosis
(OR 1.16 (95% 1.06, 1.26)) but not with any fibrosis (OR 1.15 (95% 0.99,

Development of hepatocellular carcinoma
Five cohorts (3,803 participants, 360 cases of NAFLD-HCC) reported on
development of HCC in patients with NAFLD. Presence of T-allele was
associated with increased odds of HCC in NAFLD (OR 1.43 (95% CI 1.22,

Disease outcomes in adults
Using data from previous meta-analyses via Phenoscanner and UK BioBank

DISCUSSION
Identification of genetic variants associated with NAFLD has the potential to
inform pre-clinical research and our understanding of hepatic metabolism. In
this meta-analysis we have validated the importance of rs641738C>T near
MBOAT7 on the full spectrum of NAFLD in adults.

A two-stage GWAS initially identified rs641738C>T as a genome-wide
significant locus for alcohol-related cirrhosis(3). MBOAT7 was a potentially
interesting target as an enzyme involved in (phosphor)lipid metabolism,
conceptually similar to other SNVs at GWAS-significance in alcoholic and
non-alcoholic liver disease, namely TM6SF2 and PNPLA3. Later studies
found the variant to influence the full spectrum of fatty liver disease, from
steatosis to NASH, to fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC(4,8). However, these
associations have not been consistently replicated in the literature(11). We
conducted a meta-analysis to firmly establish the association of rs641738C>T
with NAFLD.

Main findings
We found that the T-allele of rs641738C>T was associated with higher liver
fat content, and with an increased risk of NASH, fibrosis, and HCC. The
effects sizes of rs641738C>T reported here are small compared to those of
PNPLA3 p.I148M and TM6SF2 p.E167K, the two strongest steatogenic
variants(2). Also, unlike NASH-associated variants in PNPLA3, HSD17B13,
MARC1, and TM6SF2, there was no association between this MBOAT7
variant and alanine or aspartate aminotransferase. The marginal positive

effect of this variant on hepatic triglyceride content may suggest alterations in
the composition of hepatic lipid, rather than quantity(8). This is consistent with
pre-clinical data on lipotoxicity, where the composition of hepatic fats
influence development of NASH. On the other hand, a recent Mendelian
randomization study using these variables as instruments to assess causality
of fatty liver in determining fibrosis has shown the effect of steatosis highly
correlates with fibrosis in all the genetic variables indicating that quantity of
lipid rather than quality may be more important(20). Functional studies are
needed to understand the relationship between quality/quantity of fat and
hepato-toxic/-protective mechanism in causing progression of disease.

The function of this variant is still relatively poorly understood and there is
conflicting evidence as to whether rs641738 is associated with changes in
hepatic expression of MBOAT7. Results from the GTEx Consortium show a
strong negative association with T-allele(7), which is supported by data from
Schadt et al.(44). MBOAT7 protein expression correlated with mRNA in liver
biopsies from Mancina et al.(4) but this finding was not replicated by Sookoian
et al.(11). MBOAT7 encodes LPIAT1, a 6 transmembrane domain protein
involved in acyl-chain remodeling of membranes that influence intracellular
membrane composition and circulating phosphatidylinositols(8). Further
recent metabolite profiling data implicates MBOAT7 as the causal gene for
this SNV(32). Moreover, TMC4 was found with a low expression in the liver(4)
that is consistent with no mechanistic data supporting its role in NAFLD.

The hypothesis that MBOAT7 is the causal gene underlying the association
with liver disease at the locus is supported by the observation that mice
deficient for MBOAT7 have altered hepatic concentrations of polyunsaturated
phosphatidylinositol(45). In addition, loss of MBOAT7, but not TMC4,
increases the severity of NAFLD in mice fed a high-fat diet(46). It is not known
whether these genetically modified animals have increased susceptibility to
HCC.

This variant shows a particularly strong association with development of HCC.
It is unclear whether this reflects the effect on NASH-fibrosis or if there is a
specific causal relationship between MBOAT7 and HCC.

We found no evidence of rs641738 on insulin resistance: the key driver of
hepatic steatosis, as determined by unaltered fasting insulin concentrations.
GWAS meta-analyses of type 2 diabetes have implicated p.I148M in PNPLA3
and p.E167K in TM6SF2 as significant risk loci(47) (albeit with very modest
effect size as compared to their effects on liver disease) and a Mendelian
randomization study indicates a causal role in determining insulin resistance
mediated by the degree of liver damage(20). Similarly, these two variants are
associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease whereas rs641738
has no effect. It does, however, appear to be weakly associated with higher
prevalence of stroke in the UK BioBank(18). Our analysis also found lower
serum triglycerides in those with TT-genotype versus CC-genotype, though
this was not replicated in the Global Lipid Genetic Consortium data(48).

There is some evidence that genetic variants affect response to drug
treatment (for PNPLA3(49)) but this is yet to be explored for MBOAT7. It will
be equally interesting to assess whether somatic genotype of variants
associated with HCC affects treatment response.

A strength of this analysis is the inclusion of data from individuals of multiple
ethnicities (and genetic ancestries). We found no difference in the impact of
the variant on liver disease among Caucasian and non-Caucasian individuals.
Another strength is the large number of individuals with liver biopsy-derived
phenotypic data.

Limitations and quality of evidence
An important practical consideration is the population frequency of this variant
in different ethnicities. The mean allelic frequency of the effect (T-)allele is
highly variable: from 0.24 in East Asians compared to 0.53 in those of South
Asian ancestry(50).

Studies measured hepatic fat using several different imaging modalities,
which have varying sensitivity for quantification of liver fat. This may have
accounted for some of the heterogeneity observed in these analyses. There
was a trend towards more positive associations in population-based studies
using more sensitive techniques (MRI or MRS). It is possible that weighting
towards large CT-based studies could have underestimated the true effect
size.

We found significant differences between adult and paediatric histological
analyses though a consistent trend was observed in the analysis of hepatic fat
fraction. There are several potential reasons, including: sample size
insufficient to demonstrate an effect, variations in imaging quantification of fat,
too few clinical events (i.e. with fibrosis) to demonstrate an effect, different
histology of paediatric NASH, or a true alternative effect of this variant on
paediatric NAFLD.

Though there was minimal heterogeneity across included studies, the
numbers of individuals with NAFLD and HCC were comparatively low. Further
work in this area may improve the accuracy of effect estimates.

Conclusions
rs641738C>T near MBOAT7 increases risk of NASH, fibrosis, and HCC in
NAFLD with a small, positive effect on total liver fat and no impact on insulin
resistance. These data validate this locus as significant in the pathogenesis of
NAFLD.
