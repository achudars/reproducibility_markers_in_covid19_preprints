Abstract

25

Background: Vector-borne disease places a high health and economic burden in the American

26

tropics. Comprehensive vector control programs remain the primary method of containing local

27

outbreaks. With limited resources, many vector control operations struggle to serve all affected

28

communities within their districts. In the coastal city of Machala, Ecuador, vector control

29

services, such as application of larvicides and truck-mounted fogging, are delivered through two

30

deployment facilities managed by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health. Public health professionals

31

in Machala face several logistical issues when delivering mosquito abatement services, namely

32

applying limited resources in ways that will most effectively suppress vectors of malaria,

33

dengue, and encephalitis viruses.

34

Methods: Using a transportation network analysis framework, we built models of service areas

35

and optimized delivery routes based on distance costs associated with accessing neighborhoods

36

throughout the city. Optimized routes were used to estimate the relative cost of accessing

37

neighborhoods for mosquito control services in Machala, creating a visual tool to guide decision

38

makers and maximize mosquito control program efficiency. Location-allocation analyses were

39

performed to evaluate efficiency gains of moving service deployment to other available locations

40

with respect to distance to service hub, neighborhood population, dengue incidence, and housing

41

condition.

42

Results: Using this framework, we identified different locations for targeting mosquito control

43

efforts, dependent upon management goals and specified risk factors of interest, including human

44

population, housing condition, and reported dengue incidence. Our models indicate that

45

neighborhoods on the periphery of Machala with the poorest housing conditions are the most

46

costly to access. Optimal locations of facilities for deployment of control services change

depending on pre-determined management priorities, increasing the population served via

48

inexpensive routes up to 34.9%, and reducing overall cost of accessing neighborhoods up to

49

12.7%.

50

Conclusions: Our transportation network models indicate that current locations of mosquito

51

control facilities in Machala are not ideal for minimizing driving distances or maximizing

52

populations served. Services may be optimized by moving vector control operations to other

53

existing public health facilities in Machala. This work represents a first step in creating a spatial

54

tool for planning and critically evaluating the systematic delivery of mosquito control services in

55

Machala and elsewhere.

Background

59

Public Health Vector Control in Latin America

60

Delivery of vector control services in the public health sector is challenging throughout

61

much of Latin America, where the management of vectored diseases is complicated by diversity

62

in both pathogens and vectors, most notably in the tropics. High prevalence of mosquito-borne

63

diseases, coupled with oftentimes limited capacity for mosquito abatement and medical services,

64

can rapidly overwhelm existing healthcare systems [1–4]. Still, outbreaks of mosquito-borne

65

pathogens are problematic, even in municipalities with excellent public health infrastructure.

66

Comprehensive vector control programs are widely acknowledged as a fiscally conservative

67

strategy for suppressing and preventing outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases in Latin America,

68

employing combinations of surveillance, abatement, and educational outreach to the public [5–9].

69

Indeed, the operating budgets of vector control agencies pale in comparison with the resources

70

consumed, and productivity lost, during large outbreak events. Nevertheless, the costs incurred

71

by vector control efforts can still pose significant burden, particularly in communities with

72

limited funds dedicated to public health activities [10].

73

The consequences associated with implementing control strategies without robust

74

planning and review are many, ranging from reduced impact of funding streams to outright

75

intervention failure [11,12]. It is therefore imperative that vector control agencies critically plan

76

and evaluate their delivery systems to ensure efficient operations and judicious application of

77

resources. There are two strategies of applying public health vector control efforts to control

78

outbreaks: i) proactively, where high risk areas of mosquito production are targeted based on

79

prior information ahead of transmission peaks, and ii) reactively, where abatement activities are

80

triggered in direct response to incoming surveillance data, particularly high numbers of human

81

disease cases [13]. Although well-planned proactive vector control can be immensely

82

advantageous, effectively reducing mosquito source populations and suppressing transmission

83

before outbreak events occur, public funding is often skewed towards reactive programs, where

84

the rapid deployment of service is triggered by reported disease clusters [13].

85

Vector Control and Mosquito-Borne Diseases in Ecuador

86

Located on the northwestern coast of South America, Ecuador has historically been an

87

active area of mosquito-borne disease transmission, long contending with seasonal outbreaks of

88

malaria and dengue. Much of this seasonal transmission is concentrated in densely populated

89

areas of low elevation along the coast. Ecuador has a strong precedence of vector control

90

activities, having formerly eradicated Aedes aegypti, and as a result yellow fever and dengue, in

91

the 1950s [14]. However, eradication was followed by a period of lax vector control policy and

92

diverted funding throughout Ecuador and much of South America, culminating in large

93

outbreaks of dengue fever beginning in the late 1980s [3,15]. Currently, there is active

94

transmission of several arboviruses in Ecuador, including yellow fever virus (YFV), four

95

serotypes of dengue virus (DENV 1-4), chikungunya virus (CHKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), all

96

of which are competently vectored by the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) [16–18]. The

97

recent documentation of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in Guayaquil, Ecuador

98

raises further concern with local public health officials, as this species is also capable of

99

vectoring the same viruses as Ae. aegypti in Ecuador [19,20]. Despite the presence of competent

100

vectors, targeted control has the potential to mitigate the effects of disease outbreaks, as was seen

101

with the local elimination of malaria transmission at the Ecuador-Peru border, thus

102

demonstrating the efficacy of consistently applied case surveillance and vector control programs

103

[21].

Machala is a port city located in Ecuador’s El Oro province on the southern coast (Fig.

105

106

second largest port, and a center of agricultural trade [22,23].

Fig. 1. The South American country of Ecuador (A) contends with endemic dengue transmission,
particularly in southern coastal El Oro province (B, shown in yellow). Machala (B, red star) is a
port city in El Oro and the fourth largest city in the country. The Ecuadorian Ministry of Health
deploys mosquito control activities in Machala through two centrally located deployment hubs
(C). Mosquito abatement services formerly operated from several medical subcenters (red
crosses) throughout the city. This figure was produced in ArcMap 10.4 (ESRI, Redlands, CA)
using shapefiles from the GADM database of Global Administrative Areas, ver. 2.8 (gadm.org),
transportation network and census data from INEC, and georeferenced facility locations provided
by the MoH.

117

Machala has a long history of operational mosquito control and surveillance due to high dengue

118

incidence relative to surrounding areas, making it an ideal setting to study delivery systems of

119

vector control services. Formerly, fumigation and control services were deployed from

120

decentralized medical subcenters located throughout Machala as a part of the National Service

121

for the Control of Vector-borne Diseases (in Spanish: Servicio Nacional de Control de

Enfermedades Transmitidas por Vectores Artrópodos – SNEM), a vertically structured vector-

123

borne disease eradication program in the Ministry of Health (MoH) [24]. In 2015, SNEM was

124

disbanded and public health surveillance and mosquito control in Machala became decentralized

125

and administered by the local MoH health districts, with two centrally located hubs from which

126

abatement services are deployed (Fig. 1). A variety of chemical control methods are utilized by

127

these service hubs including aquatic larvicides (temefos/abate) and indoor residual spraying of

128

residential homes (deltamethrin) delivered by technicians visiting homes, and ultra-low-volume

129

(ULV) fogging with adulticides (malathion) delivered at the street level via trucks.

130

Implementation of vector control services in Machala requires considerable daily transportation,

131

moving people, materials, and equipment from service hubs throughout the city via MoH trucks.

132

Previous studies on dengue in Machala have shown associations between census housing

133

characteristics and disease incidence, indicating that risk of contracting mosquito-borne diseases

134

is not evenly distributed throughout the city [16,25]. Under current management strategies,

135

neighborhoods are not prioritized for treatment in a proactive, systematic manner based on

136

household-level risk factors, due in part to limited funding and resources [10]. Instead, service

137

schedules are developed from local knowledge and experiences, with the goal of ensuring

138

coverage to as many households as possible before and during the rainy season. Additionally,

139

during transmission season spray treatments are delivered when surveillance cases exceed

140

predetermined thresholds, or in response to residential mosquito complaints. While this method

141

of service delivery is targeted in a sense, it is nevertheless in reaction to detected caseloads and

142

self-reported mosquito presence, creating a lag between transmission and vector control, and

143

potentially failing to treat high-risk neighborhoods with low reporting. Ideally, mosquito control

144

operators in Machala should have tools available to plan control efforts in a more systematic and

dynamic manner, emphasizing delivery of services to areas within the city with the highest risk

146

of experiencing outbreaks.

147

Transportation Network Analysis

148

Network analysis frameworks have long been used in the realm of public health planning

149

to effectively allocate resources, improve operations, and guide policymaking in communities

150

[26–28]. This family of analyses is particularly useful in the assessment of service demand,

151

planning of delivery routes, and evaluation of deployment facilities in relation to underlying road

152

networks. Many transportation network problems are based on road network distances, for

153

example, establishing areas of service based on driving distance and finding optimal driving

154

routes with a modification of Dijkstra’s algorithm, wherein the shortest distance paths between a

155

given origin and destination pair are found [29,30]. Under this framework, the relative costs and

156

potential benefits of service deliveries can be weighed under various management goals and

157

priorities, providing a flexible tool to aid in proactive decision-making and resource allocation.

158

Although commonly used in the context of solving accessibility and allocation problems

159

in the public health sector, to our knowledge there have been no efforts to apply network analysis

160

methodologies in the optimization of vector control service delivery. Our goal was to build a

161

network-based analytic framework that would aid in the planning and delivery of mosquito

162

control services in Machala, demonstrating the utility of network analysis in a public health

163

vector control context. With this goal in mind, the objectives of this study were to 1) establish

164

service areas of vector control service deployment facilities based on road-network distance,

165

describing factors that guide management decisions in context of accessibility; 2) identify the

166

optimal delivery routes from current spray facilities to neighborhoods, estimating the relative

167

costs of delivery; and 3) explore alternate locations of service deployment hubs under different

schemes.

Methods

171

Data Sources

172

Census data collected in Machala, Ecuador, aggregated to neighborhood census blocks

173

(n=254, referred to as neighborhood hereinafter), were provided by the Ecuadorian National

174

Institute of Statistics and Census (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos – INEC) for the

175

most recent national census, conducted in 2010 [22,31]. Based on previous studies of dengue risk

176

in Machala, factors of interest deemed relevant in relation to the delivery and prioritization of

177

mosquito control services included data on population (Fig. 2A) and housing condition index

178

(HCI) (Fig. 2B) [25]. Housing condition has been shown to be strongly associated with

179

mosquito-borne disease incidence in Machala, as houses in poor condition allow mosquitoes to

180

enter the home and have more abundant larval habitat in the home and patio [25,32,33]. The HCI

181

is an aggregate variable combining grades of roof, wall, and floor quality as a measure of overall

182

housing condition, with 0 being excellent condition and 1 being very poor condition.

Health provided data on (C) dengue incidence in Machala for the year 2010. This figure was
produced in ArcMap 10.4 (ESRI, Redlands, CA).
Data regarding the road network in Machala were also obtained from INEC, reflecting

191

the most complete dataset for transportation networks available for the city. Although some

192

information on road classification (e.g. primary versus secondary roads) was available, the

193

majority of road segments are not classified. Consequently, all roads were considered to have the

194

same functional accessibility in network analyses. Furthermore, Ecuador enforces uniform speed

195

limits (50 km per hour) for all municipalities throughout the country, thus precluding the

196

calculation of variable travel times [34].

197

De-identified human case data from a 2010 outbreak of dengue fever in Machala,

198

aggregated to barrios (i.e. neighborhood census blocks), were provided by the Ecuadorian

199

Ministry of Health (MoH) and have been previously described [25]. Human surveillance data are

200

routinely used in making reactionary vector control decisions, and were used in our analyses as a

201

weighting factor to simulate prioritization of service delivery. The MoH provided GPS

202

coordinates for their two active mosquito abatement facilities, from which mosquito control

203

services are deployed, as well as coordinates for eight MoH-operated medical clinics found

204

throughout Machala, from which mosquito control services were formerly delivered. Census and

205

human case data were mapped in ArcGIS (ver. 10.4) to visualize spatial patterns (Fig. 2C),

206

serving as points of comparison and weighting factors for network analyses.

208

Establishment of Service Areas – Spatial analyses of the transportation network in Machala were

209

performed in ArcGIS (ver. 10.4) using the ‘Network Analyst’ extension toolbox. Service areas

210

were generated based on driving distance from the two mosquito control facilities along the road

211

network, enabling the identification of characteristics of the population served. Overlap of

212

service area boundaries between the two spray hubs was allowed, and service areas were

213

delimited at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and >5 km driving distances from either facility. The census data were

214

overlaid onto service areas to reveal population, housing characteristics, and reported dengue

215

incidence (Table 1).

Finding Optimized Delivery Routes – The most efficient routes of travel from mosquito control

223

facilities to service demand locations were calculated using Dijkstra’s algorithm, modified to

224

find the shortest routes between multiple origins (i.e. service facilities) and destinations (i.e.

225

neighborhoods) as employed by the ‘Closest Facility’ tool in the ArcMap Network Analyst

226

toolbox. Driving distance (km) along the road network was specified as the as the impedance, or

227

cost of access to be minimized. Locations of individual households were not discernable from

228

the aggregated data provided by INEC, and service destinations were set to the centroid of each

229

neighborhood. Many of the block centroids did not intersect directly with the road network, and

230

a 500 m tolerance was set to ensure the inclusion of all destinations in the analysis.

231

The monetary costs associated with delivery of mosquito abatement services in Machala

232

were estimated for the optimized driving routes found in the Closest Facility analysis. In

233

Machala, MoH mosquito control staff are capable of treating approximately 25 households with

234

backpack sprayers before returning to a spray hub to refill, assuming one pair of spray

235

technicians per deployment. Using this estimate of service capacity, the number of trips that

236

MoH service teams need to make in order to completely treat every household in a given

237

neighborhood was calculated by dividing the total number of households in a neighborhood by

238

the number of houses treated in a single trip. Overall cost of access for neighborhoods was

239

estimated by applying estimates of fuel consumption for service team trucks to the distance of

240

optimized service delivery routes, multiplied by the number of trips needed to treat all

241

households within a given neighborhood. Fuel economy was estimated using the average price of

242

gasoline in Ecuador ($0.61/L in 2016) and the fuel consumption of a standard pickup truck

243

manufactured in 2010 (5.53 km/L in city), values that reasonably reflect the price of gasoline and

244

grade of service vehicles currently available to mosquito control teams in Machala [35,36].

245

Alternate Service Locations – Currently, mosquito control services are delivered from two hubs

246

located in central Machala. To test if other combinations of locations may enable more efficient

247

delivery of services under difference management strategies, we used the “Location-Allocation”

248

tool in ArcGIS Network Analyst Toolbox. Location-allocation problems, where the best sites for

249

service deployment are identified from a set of candidate locations, can be solved to meet a

250

variety of user-specified goals, such as minimizing driving distance or maximizing the number of

251

households served. We set the Location-Allocation tool to minimize weighted impedance,

252

defined as driving distance along the road network, from deployment facilities to demand points

253

(i.e. neighborhoods) with the goal of finding optimal placement for two spray hubs in Machala

254

under different mosquito control strategies. Eight medical subcenters in Machala operated by the

255

MoH were designated as candidates for alternate spray hub locations (Fig. 1). These subcenters

256

were formerly outfitted for mosquito control operations prior to consolidation of abatement

257

activities in Machala, making them logistically feasible for new potential locations of service

258

deployment. Four location-allocation analyses were performed, where 1) only distance travelled

259

on the road network was set as impedance without an additional weighting factor, identifying the

260

two best locations to reduce overall transportation costs; 2) demand points (i.e. neighborhoods)

261

were weighted by population size, identifying optimal locations to not only reduce driving

262

distances, but also to prioritize those locations with highest demand; 3) demand points were

263

weighted by reported human dengue cases, targeting areas that are prioritized for treatment under

264

reactionary vector control; and 4) weighting demand by HCI, a scenario which simulates

265

proactive management decisions based on a known social-ecological risk factor for dengue. The

266

optimal facilities identified from these four location-allocation analyses were compared to

267

current facility locations in terms of the relative cost and accessibility.

268

Results

269

Mapping of census and epidemiological data revealed marked differences in the spatial

270

distribution of factors that may be used to influence mosquito control decisions in Machala (Fig.

271

2). Indicators related to human population and settlement appear to be heterogeneous throughout

272

the city, while the highest observations of dengue incidence were more centrally located during

273

the 2010 outbreak. In contrast with reported dengue, households with high HCI (i.e. poor

274

condition) are more peripherally located in Machala.

275

Establishment of Service Areas – Given the centralized location of the two active

276

mosquito abatement deployment facilities in Machala, estimated catchment areas of service

277

based on driving distance from facilities radiate from the city’s center, indicating greater

278

impedance to access of peripheral neighborhoods, in particular the Puerto Bolivar port region in

279

the west (Fig. 3). The area within 1.1–3.0 km driving distance of either deployment facility

280

encompasses the highest population (n=122,877), while the lowest population (n=9,324) was

The centralized location of deployment facilities translates into generally increased driving

299

distance, or impedance to access, for neighborhoods moving away from the city’s center.

300

Applying fuel efficiency estimates to these distances, the cost associated traveling along optimal

301

routes ranged from $0.02–$1.28 (USD), indicating the cost of gasoline consumed in one round

302

trip to a given neighborhood. Applying fuel consumption estimates for optimized routes to the

303

number of deployment trips needed to fully treat a neighborhood (i.e. where spray teams treat

304

each household in a neighborhood once, returning to a hub to refill spray packs after treating 25

305

houses), enabled us to map and visualize the relative cost of accessing neighborhoods for

306

treatment in the context of service demand (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. Estimated cost of service access for optimized driving routes from the closest mosquito
spraying facility to neighborhood block centroids in Machala. Relative cost of access was
determined via fuel consumption along routes and the number of trips required by mosquito
control operators to treat each household in a neighborhood once, providing a visual means of
comparing cost of access to demand for service. This figure was produced in ArcMap 10.4
(ESRI, Redlands, CA).

314

Estimated cost of access to treat all households in a given neighborhood block ranged from

315

$0.08-$27.45, with an average cost of $4.03. Neighborhoods with the lowest cost of access had

316

the highest dengue incidence, while neighborhoods with mid-range cost of access require the

317

greatest number of deployments to treat all households (Table 2). However, remote

318

neighborhoods with high cost access routes had the highest mean HCI, signifying the poorest

319

quality housing (Table 2).

alternative spray hub locations weighted by distance, population, and dengue incidence, we

348

found that estimated costs of fuel consumed on routes ranged from $0.02 to $1.06 per round trip,

resulting in costs of accessing neighborhoods for treatment that ranged from $0.12 to $27.45,

with an average cost of $3.52. These estimated costs of delivery from alternative hub locations

Choosing facilities that optimized coverage of neighborhoods based on HCI, estimated fuel

359

consumption for optimal routes ranged from $0.04 to $1.06 per round trip, resulting in costs of

360

accessing neighborhoods for treatment that ranged from $0.12 to $27.45, with an average cost of

361

$3.66. This estimated cost of delivery indicates a 9.2% reduction in average fuel costs compared

362

to the currently active spray facilities, and a 34.9% increase in the population served by the least

363

expensive routes (Table 3). Selected candidate locations not only lower the average costs

Discussion

373

The results of this study highlight the importance and practical application of

374

transportation network analysis to optimize mosquito control interventions in a dengue-endemic

375

region. In visualizing census and epidemiological data from Machala by neighborhood blocks,

376

there are clear discrepancies in the spatial distribution of factors commonly used by ministry

377

officials to guide vector control decisions, particularly in poor quality housing, which is

378

concentrated near the city’s outer limits (Fig. 2). The variation in spatial distributions of factors

379

translates into differential prioritization of locations for treatment throughout the city, dependent

380

upon specified management goals. Summarizing georeferenced data by transportation network

381

service areas provided a general assessment of accessibility from spray deployment hubs, and

382

demonstrated underlying differences that can impact decision-making and risk perception (Table

383

1, Fig. 3). For example, if the agency’s goal is to maximize the number of people or households

384

that receive control services, then the service area within 1.1–3 km driving distance of active

385

spray hubs would represent a high management priority. In contrast, if the abatement goal is to

386

target households in poor condition, a strategy to disrupt transmission pathways via reduced

387

exposure to vectors, then the service area within 3.1–5 km of spray hubs would be a more

388

suitable target for concentrating treatments. Under the optimized route model for closest

389

facilities, neighborhoods with the poorest HCI, and some areas of high population in northern

390

and southern Machala, are among the costliest locations to access from current spray deployment

391

hubs based on driving distance (Figs. 3 & 4). Cost of access in Machala, whether expressed as

392

distance along the road network or estimated fuel consumption, is generally higher for the urban

393

periphery, particularly near municipal boundaries (Figs. 4 & 5).

394

Visualizing census and epidemiological surveillance data in Machala reveals stark

395

differences in the spatial distribution of reported dengue rates in the year 2010 and HCI, a known

396

driver of arbovirus transmission in Machala (Fig. 2B & C). In a decision-making capacity, these

397

factors represent two very different management philosophies in mosquito control—proactive

398

versus reactive management. Mosquito abatement services are currently initiated at the

399

beginning of coastal Ecuador’s rainy season in anticipation of mosquito production resulting

400

from impounded water; individual neighborhoods are targeted in response to incoming human

401

cases and areas of historically high risk. The MoH detects cases via passive arbovirus

402

surveillance and not in a systematic fashion, and budgetary constraints on vector control and

403

surveillance have become more pronounced following the dissolution of Ecuador’s national

404

vector control program [10]. The MoH schedules regular larviciding in Machala. However, focal

405

control in spatially discrete areas is very much reactive in nature, a response to cases detected via

406

surveillance. Larvicides and adulticides are applied in critical locations only after human cases

407

have been reported to clinics and verified by the MoH, well after transmission events have taken

408

place. While this management strategy may aid in suppressing localized outbreaks and

409

minimizing upfront abatement costs, it is nevertheless susceptible to inherent lags in surveillance

410

systems and underreporting of cases, which are often exacerbated in at-risk areas with limited

411

access to health services or low health care seeking behavior [37,38]. Indeed, the dearth of

412

reported surveillance data in Machala’s periphery is counterintuitive, given that neighborhoods

413

near the city’s municipal limits generally have elevated risk of exposure as determined via poor

414

housing condition [39]. In exploring alternative management strategies, proactive mosquito

415

abatement may be a viable addition to current policy, where neighborhoods with known risk

416

factors are targeted for treatment before peaks in seasonal outbreaks are expected. However,

417

under the current mosquito abatement structure, proactive management may not be the most

418

cost-effective policy, as neighborhoods with the poorest quality housing have the largest

419

economic barriers to access (Figs. 4 & 5).

420
421

This novel modeling effort has enabled us to make a first assessment of the costs
associated with the delivery of mosquito spray services in Machala, using distance and fuel

422

estimates as the impedance, or cost, of access. While this is a reasonable proxy of assessing

423

relative barriers to access, several costs incurred by mosquito controllers were not included in

424

our models due to lack of data, resulting in an underestimation of true operating expenses. Costs

425

associated with abatement methods, driving times, time needed to treat each neighborhood,

426

number of deployed technicians, agency operating hours, and quality of services could not be

427

accounted for in these models. Data on the recurring costs associated with maintaining an

428

operational fleet of vehicles (e.g. upkeep and repair costs) were also not available for this study

429

[40]. In reality, the cost of access may be higher than estimated for some neighborhoods,

430

particularly in the urban periphery where factors such as lack of paved roads may increase the

431

time and resources needed to treat an area, as well as wear on fleet vehicles. We also assumed in

432

these analyses that both spray hubs are fully operational, offering equivalent services. This is not

433

always the case, particularly with delivery of ULV fogging services, as the number of

434

operational vehicles in the spray fleet fluctuates due to mechanical issues. Furthermore, census

435

and epidemiological data were only available for the most recent census year, which does not

436

reflect current conditions, possible spatiotemporal shifts in disease risk, or potentially vulnerable

437

communities residing beyond the official administrative limits of Machala [22,41]. The available

438

spatial resolution of neighborhoods presents a further limitation in using these models for

439

optimizing real-world service routes. Although not available for this study, georeferenced data

440

on household locations within each neighborhood would allow us to better estimate the costs and

441

driving distances associated with delivering household-level services, providing mapped routes

442

that could conceivably be shared with mosquito control personnel.

443

Mapping optimal driving routes not only provides a means of streamlining service

444

delivery, but also enables us to identify where high impedance to remote locations occurs.

445

Excessive transportation distances may indicate practical barriers to service, limiting the number

446

of people or vulnerable households that are able to effectively receive mosquito control services.

447

This has implications for resource allocation and goal setting, where budgetary caps and

448

personnel availability place logistical constraints on how often neighborhoods are treated. In

449

Machala, delivery of abatement services in neighborhoods with poor housing condition, a

450

previously described driver of mosquito production, becomes more costly, particularly for

451

densely populated neighborhoods that require multiple visits to restock insecticides (Fig. 5)

452

[16,25,42]. Previous studies conducted in Machala indicate that the urban periphery is not only

453

more likely to have characteristics that drive dengue transmission, but also residents of these

454

areas feel neglected with regards to mosquito control services offered by the MoH [10,42].

455

Accordingly, the centralized location of current mosquito abatement facilities is not ideal, in the

456

sense that the shortest network distances overlap in areas that may not be high priority targets for

457

treatment. While the best candidate locations for spray facilities are dependent upon desired

458

impacts, results of the location-allocation analysis support that the current combination of

459

mosquito abatement hubs is not selected as the most efficient in any of the tested management

460

priorities. Still, there may be logistical benefits to the current location of facilities, such as

461

personnel coordination, communication, and resource sharing. Therefore, we suggest that when

462

selecting optimal locations for mosquito control facilities in the future, clear management goals

463

and priorities must be defined for abatement programs.

routes, and exploration of goal-oriented management strategies, can serve as a template for other

regions burdened with mosquito-borne disease transmission. The network analysis framework

featured in this study highlights the utility of applying public health planning methodologies

visualizations offer a powerful means of informing agency decision making, allowing for public

health officials to critically assess the costs associated with delivery of services throughout a

municipality. Additionally, the tools presented here offer a flexible environment in which current

management strategies can be reviewed and compared to alternative policy approaches,

the face of limited agency resources.
