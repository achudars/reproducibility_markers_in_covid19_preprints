Abstract
Background: Despite being a preventable complication of surgical procedures, surgical site
infections (SSIs) continue to threaten public health with significant impacts on the patients and
the health-care human and financial resources. With millions affected globally, there
issignificant variation in the primary studies on the prevalence of SSIs in Ethiopia. Therefore,
this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of SSI and its associated factors among
postoperative patients in Ethiopia.

Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Psyinfo, African Journals Online, and Google Scholar were
searched for studies that looked at SSI in postoperative patients. A funnel plot and Egger’s
regression test were used to determine publication bias. The I2 statistic was used to check
heterogeneity between the studies. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was applied to
estimate the pooled effect size, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence interval (CIs) across
studies. The subgroup analysis was conducted by region, sample size, and year of publication.
Sensitivity analysis was deployed to determine the effect of a single study on the overall
estimation. Analysis was done using STATA™ Version 14 software.

Result: A total of 24 studies with 13,136 study participants were included in this study.
The estimated pooled prevalence of SSI in Ethiopia was 12.3% (95% CI: 10.19, 14.42). Duration
of surgery > 1 hour (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.08 –2.94), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 3.25; 95% CI:
1.51–6.99), American Society of Anaesthesiologists score >1 (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI: 1.07–5.91),
previous surgery (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.77–3.53), clean-contaminated wound (AOR = 2.15;
95% CI: 1.52–3.04), and preoperative hospital stay > 7 day (AOR = 5.76; 95% CI: 1.15–28.86),
were significantly associated with SSI.

Conclusion: The prevalence of SSI among postoperative patients in Ethiopia remains high
with a pooled prevalence of 12.3% in 24 extracted studies. Therefore, situation based
interventions and region context-specific preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the
prevalence of SSI among postoperative patients.

Introduction
Surgical site infections (SSIs) are infections that occur at or near surgical incision within 30 days
of operation or after 1 year if an implant is placed [1]. SSIs are a major cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide, affecting 5.6% of surgical procedures in developing countries [2].
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the incidence of SSIs ranges from 1.2
to 23.6 per 100 surgical procedures [3]. Worldwide, it has been reported that more than one-third
of postoperative deaths are related to SSIs [4]. In addition, SSIs threaten the lives of millions of
patients each year and contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance[5].
The incidence of SSIs is higher in developing countries relative to developed nations [6],
reported as the second most common cause of hospital acquired infection (HAI) in Europe and
the United States of America (USA) [7]. Approximately 2–5% of surgical patients worldwide
have developed SSIs [8]. SSIs are the most frequent type of HAI in low and middle income
countries (LMICs) and affect up to one third of patients who have undergone a surgical
procedure [9, 10]. In LMICs, the pooled incidence of SSI was 11.8 per 100 surgical procedures
[11]. In Africa, SSIs were the leading infections in hospitals and incidence ranged from 2.5%30.9% [12]. Substantial evidentiary variation on the prevalence of SSI exists across the globe,
such as 10.56% in Nnewi [13], 53% in Iran [14], and 16.4% in Uganda [15].
According to recent evidence, the risk factors for SSI are multifactorial and complex. For
instance, pre-existing illness [16-18], wound contamination [13, 15, 19], American Society of
Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score III or IV [13, 20], non-use of prophylactic antibiotics [21],
presence of hypovolemic [22], longer duration of operation [16, 17, 21], longer preoperative
hospital stay [16, 21], postoperative hospital stay [16, 19], advanced age [16, 21], alcohol use
[19, 23], previous surgery [23], use of drain [17], use of iodine alone in skin preparation [17],
smoking [17, 18], absence of wound care [18], and hair removal inside operating room [20] were
factors associated with SSIs.
Though SSIs are among the most preventable healthcare-associated infections. However,
according to the available global evidence, SSIs impose significant burden to the patient and
health care system in terms of prolonged hospital stays [24], spend time in an intensive care unit
[7], readmission to hospital [25], long-term disability [26], contribute to spread of antibiotic

resistance [3, 11], increase treatment intensity [24], substantial financial burden to health care
systems [7, 26], high costs for patients and families [7, 27, 28], deterioration in the quality of
life [29] , and unnecessary deaths [3, 7, 26]. Effectively controlling SSIs can reduce some of
these negative effects [11], as up to one-half of SSIs can generally be prevented through an
improved adherence to established basic principles, such as surgical hand preparation, skin
antisepsis, adequate antibiotic prophylaxis, less traumatic, less invasive and shorter surgery
duration, improved haemostasis and avoidance of hypothermia [7, 23, 30].
Despite improvements in operating room practices, instrument sterilization methods, better
surgical technique, and the best efforts of infection prevention strategies, surgical site infections
remain a major cause of hospital acquired infections. The need for SSIs prevention policies has
been recognized in Ethiopia. Different primary studies in Ethiopia show the magnitude of SSIs
as a health issue in the region; however, incidence rates are inconclusive. Therefore, this review
and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled national prevalence of SSI and its associated
factors in Ethiopia.

Methods
Literature search strategy
Initially, Cochrane library, JBI and PROSPERO databases were searched. To confirm whether
systematic review and meta-analysis is exist or for the presence of ongoing projects related to the
current topic. The literature was searched using PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, African
journals online, and Psyinfo. Relevant articles were identified according to the following terms:
“surgical site infections”, “surgical incision infection”, “postoperative”, “wound infection”,
“predictor”, “associated factors”, “Ethiopia”. The key terms were used in combination using
Boolean operators like “OR” or “AND”. The searches were restricted to full texts, free articles,
human studies, and English language publications. This search involved articles published from
January 1st, 2000 to November 11th, 2019. Grey literatures, such as surveillance reports,
academic dissertations, conference abstracts, were examined. In addition the reference lists of
included articles were hand-searched to identify any potential additional relevant articles.

Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they adhered to the following guidelines: (1) all
observational study designs (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies) needed to report
the prevalence of SSI; (2 published from 2000 to 2019; (3) published in English language; (4)
abstract and full text were available for this review; and (5) conducted in Ethiopia. Studies were
excluded if they: (1) possessed a poor quality score as per the stated criteria; (2) failed to
determine the desired outcome (SSI); (3) were not fully accessible; and (4) included only in
cesarean section patients.

Outcome of interest
The main outcome of interest was the prevalence of SSIs reported in the original paper both
as percentage or as the number of SSIs cases(n) / total number of patients who undergo surgery
(N). These two parameters were necessary to calculate the pooled prevalence of SSIs in the
meta-analysis. Therefore, the prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of individuals
who have SSIs to the total number of patients who undergo surgery (sample size) multiplied by
100.

Data extraction
Two authors independently extracted all necessary data from each study using a standardized
data extraction format. If discrepancies between data extractors were observed, a third author
was involved. For each included study, the following data were extracted: primary author,
publication year, region, study design, sample size, prevalence of SSIs, and associated factors
(wound type, preoperative hospital stay, duration of operation, history surgery, ASA score,
diabetes mellitus, smoking, preoperative blood transfusion). We also contacted corresponding
authors (by e-mail) of articles that did not provide details of their study’s background and asked
them for the relevant information, such as study time, region, or hospital.

Quality assessment
Two independent investigators assessed the methodological quality of all of the potential studies
to be included in our analysis. Any disagreements between the authors were resolved through
discussion or, if consensus could not be reached, consultation with a third, independent author

was undertaken. The quality of each included study was assessed using the Joanna Briggs
Institute (JBI) quality appraisal checklist [31]. This scale has several key criteria to appraise
cohort studies including: [1] similarity of groups, [2] similarity of exposure measurement, [3]
validity and reliability of measurement, [4] identification of confounder, [5] strategies to deal
with confounder, [6] appropriateness of groups/participants at the start of the study, [7] validity
and reliability of outcome measured, [8] sufficiency of follow-up time, [9] completeness of
follow-up or descriptions of reason to loss to follow-up, [10] strategies to address incomplete
follow-up, and [11] appropriateness of statistical analysis. The items used to appraise crosssectional studies were: [1] inclusion criteria, [2] description of study subject and setting, [3] valid
and reliable measurement of exposure, [4] objective and standard criteria used, [5] identification
of confounder, [6] strategies to handle confounder, [7] outcome measurement, and [8]
appropriate statistical analysis. Studies were considered low risk when scored at 50% and above
on the quality assessment indicators.

Statistical analysis
To obtain the pooled prevalence of surgical site infection, a meta-analysis using random-effects
DerSimonian and Laird model was performed due to anticipated heterogeneity [32]. Cochran’s Q
chi-square statistics and I2 statistical test was conducted to assess the random variations between
primary studies [33]. In this study, heterogeneity was interpreted as an I2 value of 0% = no
heterogeneity, 25% = low, 50% = moderate, and 75% = high [34]. In case of high heterogeneity,
subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses were run to identify possible moderators of this
heterogeneity. Potential publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting funnel plots and
objectively using the Egger bias test [35]. To account for any publication bias, we used the trimand-fill method, based on the assumption that the effect sizes of all the studies are normally
distributed around the center of a funnel plot. The meta-analysis was performed using the
STATA™ Version 14 software [36]. Finally, for all analyses, P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

The results of this review were reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Review and Meta-Analysis statement (PRISMA) guideline [37]. (Supplementary file-PRISMA
checklist). The entire process of study screening, selection, and inclusion were shown with the
support of a flow diagram. Additionally, tables and narrative summaries were used to report the
risk of bias for every eligible study.

Results
Search results
In the first step of our search, 293 studies were retrieved. About 289 studies were found from
five international databases and the remaining 4 were through a manual search. The databases
included PubMed (45), Scopus (31), Google Scholar (152), Psyinfo (29) and African Journals
Online (59). Of these, 128 duplicate records were identified and removed. From the remaining
168 articles, 113 articles were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts based on the predefined eligibility criteria. Finally, 55 full-text articles were assessed for their eligibility. Based
on the pre-defined criteria and quality assessment, 24 articles were included for the final
analysis. The detailed steps of the screening process are shown in a PRISMA flow chart of the
study selection (Fig. 1).

Baseline characteristics of included studies
In the current meta-analysis, a total of 24 studies with 13,136 study participants were included
to estimate the pooled prevalence of SSIs among post-operative patients. With respect to
design, two thirds (62.5%) of the studies included were cross-sectional. The studies varied
substantially in sample size, ranging from 65 to 1754. The highest prevalence (36%) of SSIs was
reported in a study conducted in Oromia [38]. Whereas the lowest prevalence (3.5%) was
reported in a study conducted in Amhara [39]. Overall information regarding the prevalence of
SSIs in post-operative patients was obtained from various regions in Ethiopia. Seven of the
studies involved participants from Addis Ababa [23, 40-45], eight from Amhara [16, 18, 39, 4650], four from Oromia [38, 51-53], three from Tigray [19, 54, 55], and two from SNNPR [21,
56]. Regarding the sampling technique, 12 studies [16, 21, 38, 39, 42, 47, 49-52, 54, 56] used the
consecutive sampling technique to select study participants. However, two studies [44, 55] did
not report their sampling methods. The quality score of each primary study, based on the JBI

Prevalence of surgical site infection
The current meta-analysis using the random effects model showed that the estimated overall
prevalence of SSI in post-operative patients was 12.3% (95% CI: 10.19,14.42) with a significant
level of heterogeneity (I2 = 93.8%; p < 0.001) (Figure 2).

Subgroup analysis
The presence of significant heterogeneity among the primary studies requires the need to conduct
subgroup analysis. In order to identify the sources of heterogeneity, we deployed sub-group
analysis using publication year, sample size, region, study design, and sampling technique to
determine the pooled prevalence of SSIs (Table 2). The prevalence of SSIs was found to be
17.19% in SSNPR, 13.08% in studies published since 2010, 14.18% in studies with
cohort design, 15.54% a sample size less than or equal to 300, and 13.38% in studies with
probability sampling technique of our included primary studies.

Publication bias
We found that there was publication bias among the included studies, as depicted by the
asymmetrical distribution of our funnel plot (Fig. 4). Likewise, the result of Egger’s test was
statistically significant for the presence of publication bias (P = 0.001). In addition, to reduce and
adjust publication bias, trim and fill analysis was also performed (Figure 5). Trim and fill
analysis is a nonparametric method for estimating the number of missing studies that might exist.

Sensitivity analysis
To evaluate the effect of an individual study on the pooled effect size, sensitivity analysis was
conducted. Sensitivity analyses using the random effects model revealed that no single study
influenced the overall prevalence of SSIs in post-operative patients (Fig. 6)

Associated factors
Based on this meta-analysis, SSIs in the Ethiopian context were associated with duration of
operation, smoking, preoperative blood transfusion, diabetes mellitus, ASA score, previous
surgery, wound type, and preoperative hospital stay.

Duration of operation
Based on the pooled effects of six studies [16, 21, 23, 40, 47, 56], duration of operation greater
than one hour were nearly two times more likely to develop SSI as compared with patients
whose operation was completed within one hour (AOR, 1.78, 95% CI 1.08, 2.94, I

Discussion
In this meta-analysis the national pooled prevalence of SSIs in Ethiopia was estimated to be
12.3% (10.19–14.42%). This finding indicates that SSIs are highly prevalent in hospital patients
and reflects inadequate implementation of infection prevention in Ethiopia.

Hence, a

multifactorial approach is required to manage SSIs, with emphasis being placed on adequate
antibiotic prophylaxis, aseptic wound care, and treatment adherence.

Our estimated prevalence of SSIs among post-operative patients in Ethiopia is in line with
systematic review and meta-analysis studies done in Nigeria 14.5% [57] and 14.8% in SubSaharan Africa [58]. However, this result was substantially higher than studies conducted in
China was 4.5% [59] and 5.4% in Algeria [60]. This variation could be justified by lack of
adequate postoperative care, inadequate infection control, and insufficient trained professionals
in Ethiopia.
Subgroup analysis in this study showed that the pooled prevalence of SSIs among post-operative
patients in SNNPR was 17.19% (95% CI: 13.3, 21.09), which was the highest amongst the
Ethiopian regions examined, followed by Addis Ababa (14.26%; 95% CI: 9.87, 18.65), whereas

the lowest rate was reported in the Amhara Region (9.36%; 95%CI;6.71, 12.0) of the country.
This variation might be due the availability of healthcare resources in the regions and the
diagnostic methods used. Based on the pooled analysis of adjusted odd ratio of studies, duration
of operation > 1 hour, diabetes mellitus, ASA score >1, previous surgery, clean contaminated
wound, and preoperative hospital stay > 7 days were associated with SSIs.
The present study revealed that the duration of operation > 1 hour were nearly two times more at
risk to acquire SSIs. This is supported by other studies conducted in Tanzania [17], Nigeria [57],
and Spain [61]. Longer duration of surgery would, therefore, increase the risk of surgical wound
contamination due to the increased microbial exposure in the operation field [62] and it also
increases the extent of tissue trauma due to an extensive surgical procedure and increased blood
loss which contributes to tissue hypoxia. Similarly, we found that those who had diabetes
mellitus were significantly associated with SSIs. This finding supported by other studies
conducted in Yemen [63], Nigeria [57], India [64], and Tanzania [17]. Previous studies have
shown that patients with pre-existing illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus are at high risk of
developing SSI due to their low immunity and that may slow the healing process [65]. We found
that patients who have ASA score >1 were 2.5 times more likely to develop SSIs, which was
supported by studies from Canada [66], Uganda [15], Nepal [67], and Cameroon [20].
Those patients with a history of previous surgery had a significant association with a surgical site
infection. This finding supported by other studies conducted in India [64]. The odds of clean
contaminated wound were nearly two times to have SSI, which is similar to studies from
Cameroon [20], China [59], Nepal [67], and Uganda [15]. The possible explanation might be
previous studies have shown that ceftriaxone is highly sensitive to suspected organisms in clean
wound [56], and surgeries with an increased microbial load in the operative field are associated
with higher risk of SSI.
In the present review, preoperative hospital stay for more than 7 days increased the risk of SSIs
by 5.76 times compared with preoperative hospital stay less than 7 days. In agreement with this
finding were studies conducted in Tanzania [17] and India [64]. The possible explanation might
be patients with long stay in hospital before surgery exposes to contamination or colonization by
pathogens which will contribute to the occurrence of SSIs [68], suggesting that shortening the

preoperative hospital stay reduces the incidence rate of SSIs. Although preoperative blood
transfusions and smoking have been established as risk factors for SSIs in other studies [17, 64],
these findings were not supported by our meta-analysis results. Further studies are, therefore,
required to validate these observations among Ethiopian patients.
This study has clinical implications in that the high prevalence of SSIs among postoperative
patients should guide healthcare professionals to minimize the risk of surgical site infection by
providing guidance to the patient who undergone to surgery, give information about possible risk
factors during routine patient care, and provide knowledge about wound care. The Nurses’ role is
considered crucial in optimizing the healing outcomes through aseptic wound care; provision of
explicit patient instructions on how to care for their wound, education and counseling and
understanding of the patient’s needs. In addition, identifying associated risk factors may help
health care professionals treat SSIs patients during their clinical care.
The meta-analysis conducted in this study has limitations that should be considered in future
research.

we did not identify all of the potential predictors of SSIs among postoperative patients.
Therefore, further study to identify associated factors for the development of SSI among
postoperative patients may be necessary.

Conclusion and recommendation
This study revealed that the prevalence of SSIs remains high among postoperative patients in
Ethiopia based on the 24 research-based papers included in this study. That said, the prevalence
of SSIs differed by region. Therefore, situation-based interventions and region context-specific
preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the prevalence of SSI. A more
comprehensive consideration of the existing evidence will potentially inform effective strategies
for preventing SSI within the Ethiopian context. In addition, this meta-analysis may help policymakers and program managers to design interventions on preventing the occurrence of SSIs.
