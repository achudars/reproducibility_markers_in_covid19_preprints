Abstract
Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk is markedly higher in UK South Asians
(SA) and African Caribbeans (AC) compared to Europeans. Explanations for this excess are
unclear. We therefore compared risks and determinants of T2DM in first- and secondgeneration (born in the UK) migrants, and in those of mixed ethnicity populations.
Methods: Data from the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort of volunteers aged 4069, were used. T2DM was assigned using self-report and glycated haemoglobin. Ethnicity was
self-assigned. Using logistic regression and mediation analysis, we compared T2DM between
first- and second-generation migrants, and between mixed European/South Asians (MixESA),
or mixed European/African Caribbeans (MixEAC) with both Europeans and SA or AC
respectively.
Results: T2DM prevalence was three to five times higher in SA and AC compared with
Europeans [OR (95%CI): 4·80(3·60,6·40) and 3·30(2·70,4·10) respectively]. T2DM was 20-30%
lower in second versus first generation SA and AC migrants [0·78(0·60,1·01) and 0·71(0·57,0·87)
respectively]. T2DM in mixed populations was lower than comparator ethnic minority groups
[MixESA versus SA 0·29(0·21,0·39), MixEAC versus AC 0·48(0·37,0·62)] and higher than
Europeans, in MixESA 1·55(1·11, 2·17), and in MixEAC 2·06 (1·53, 2·78). Improved adiposity
patterns in second generation migrants made an important contribution to risk reduction.
Greater socioeconomic deprivation accounted for 17% and 42% of the excess risk of T2DM in
MixESA and MixEAC compared to Europeans, respectively.
Conclusion: Excess T2DM risks in South Asians and African Caribbeans compared with
Europeans in the UK are attenuated by ~20% in second-generation migrants, demonstrating
the marked benefits of favourable changes in environmental risk factors. T2DM prevalence in
people of mixed ethnicity was also raised compared with Europeans, but considerably less
than in the ethnic minority group; persistent socioeconomic disadvantage accounted for some
of the residual excess.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is estimated to affect 693 million people worldwide by 2045
(1). People of African Caribbean (AC) and South Asian (SA) descent have some of the highest
rates of T2DM in the world, often three to four times greater, respectively, than those of
European ancestry when compared in the same setting (2). Explanations for this excess risk
remain unclear.
Studies of migrant offspring, and people of mixed ethnicity, where distribution and interrelations of genetic and environmental explanatory factors differ, may offer fresh insights.
Previous studies suggest second and subsequent generations of migrants are at persistently
higher risk(3). In contrast, partial European ancestry has been associated with decreased, and
non-European ancestry with increased T2DM risk in admixed populations of Hispanic,
African American, Asian, and European descent (4,5).
To date, no study has combined mixed ethnicity comparisons and inter-generational analysis
in the same setting to triangulate evidence and understand the impact of mutable
environmental risk factors in determining risk. We hypothesised that while offspring of
migrants of either SA or AC ethnicity would retain the excess risks of T2DM of their parents,
people of mixed European/South Asian (MixESA), or mixed European/African Caribbean
(MixEAC) ethnicity would have risks of T2DM intermediate between each of the parental
ethnic groups. For the latter, we further hypothesised that T2DM differences across selfreported ethnicities would largely be explained by differences in adiposity and other
socioeconomic factors.

Methods
Study design
We used data from UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort of over 500,000 men and
women aged 40-69 years recruited from primary care lists in the UK between 2006-2010 (6).

The following data were collected by self-completion or nurse administered questionnaires:
self-defined ethnicity using the UK census classification (7), year of migration to the UK to
assign generational status, health behaviours including smoking (ever smoked), physical
activity (number of days/week of moderate physical activity more than ten minutes) and diet
(data from the touchscreen questionnaire on the reported frequency of intake of a range of
common food and drink items), and sociodemographic variables such as education and
Townsend deprivation score assigned by residential postcode (8). Height, weight and body
circumferences were measured directly, and bio-impedance was used to assess fat mass and
fat percentage (%). Participants were asked to recall birth weight.
A blood sample was taken for the measurement of biochemical markers in serum. HbA1c
(mmol/mol) was measured from blood samples taken at baseline, as outlined in the UK
Biobank protocol. Values above 195 mmol/mol (n=5) were considered outliers and excluded
from the analysis.
“Known T2DM” at recruitment was defined according to an algorithm based on self-report
data and medication; this algorithm has been validated against primary care records (9). “All
T2DM” included those with “Known T2DM” plus all those with an HbA1c > 47 mmol/mol.
Migration status (first or second generation) was defined based on the reported year of
migration. Self-assigned MixESA and MixEAC were the ethnic groups of interest, with
European, SA, and AC ethnicities for comparison.

Matching procedure
Sex and age matching was needed as ethnic minority populations in the UK are younger than
the general European origin population; in addition we wished to compare first (born abroad
– migrated to the UK) and second (born to two ethnic minority parents resident in the UK)
generation migrants. The reference group was the mixed or the second-generation group,
depending on the comparison. As the reference groups were the smallest, we matched to
optimise power employing 1:4 matching where possible, and 1:2 where the sample was
insufficient. Matching was performed at random within sex and five year age bands. Each

matching procedure was performed independently to create unique datasets for each
analysis:
 MixESA (n=831) – SA – Europeans (1:4:4)
 MixEAC (n=1,045) – AC – Europeans (1:4:4)
 Second generation SA (n=1,115) – First generation SA – Europeans (1:1:2)
 Second generation AC (n=2,200) – First generation AC – Europeans (1:1:2)
Details of matching procedure and frequency distributions for each of the derived datasets
are shown in Supplement S1.

Dietary patterns
Crude food frequencies were captured by touchscreen questionnaire at baseline. Using a
principal component approach, we derived a ‘healthy’ diet variable characterised by fruit,
vegetable, fish and water consumption, and an ‘unhealthy’ diet variable, which included red
meat, processed meat and coffee drinking (further details in Supplement S2).

Statistical analyses
The mediators considered as possibly contributing to the association between ethnicity and
T2DM included: smoking; Townsend deprivation score as a proxy for socioeconomic status;
height, birth weight; years of education derived from qualifications based on the International
Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) coding (10); and adiposity measures. We
selected waist to hip ratio (WHR) as our key measure for adiposity in the SA analyses, and
body mass index (BMI) for the AC analysis, as these measures best accounted for ethnic
differences in T2DM in a previous population cohort analysis (2). Sensitivity analyses using
BMI in the SA and WHR for the AC were also performed (Supplement S3).
The extent to which adiposity pattern, deprivation, smoking, height and education mediated
the relationship between ethnicity and T2DM was explored in path models (the sample sizes
of these analyses are shown in Supplement S3). The total effect was the observed effect of
ethnicity on T2DM without adjustment; the direct effect was the remaining (independent)
effect of ethnicity on T2DM after adjustment for all variables depicted in the Directed Acyclic

Graph (DAG) (Figure 1). The difference between the two, the indirect effect, is attributed to
each of the mediators singly or jointly following the DAG defined pathways. The indirect
effect can therefore be interpreted as the percentage of the total effect mediated by these
explanatory variables. All models were adjusted for age and sex (11).
Our initial DAG included physical activity and diet (Suppl. Figure s3.1). However these
behaviours were crudely assessed (physical activity was captured as number of days per week
doing more than 10 minutes moderate physical activity, dietary data relied on a 20 item food
frequency questionnaire). For this reason, we did not include these measures in subsequent
mediation analysis. Similarly, although birth weight was considered an important mediator,
only half of the sample had these data, severely diminishing analytical precision. Birth weight
was also therefore excluded from the final DAG (Figure 1), we did however perform
sensitivity analysis on complete case data (Supplement S4). Sensitivity analyses were also
performed replacing T2DM with HbA1c as the outcome (Supplement S3).
Statistical analyses comparing recruitment characteristics were performed in Stata 15.
Mediation analysis testing path models was performed with Mplus with MLR estimator and
Monte Carlo integration at 10,000.

Results
1. South Asians
1.1.

South Asians vs Europeans

T2DM prevalence was almost five times higher in SA (odds ratio (OR): 4·8 (3·6,6·4), compared
to Europeans (Figure 2). WHR in SA (0·89) was higher than in Europeans (0·86). Proportion
resident in the lowest quintile of deprivation was near double in SA (41%), compared to
Europeans (21%) (Table 1).

1.2.

Second vs first generation South Asians

T2DM prevalence was a fifth (22%) lower in second (OR: 0·78 (0·60,1·01)) versus first
generation SA (Figure 2). WHR and proportion resident in the most deprived quintile were
marginally lower in second-generation migrants, and years of education as well (Table 1).

1.2.1. Mediation
The mediating variables we tested accounted for more than a third of the 22% lower risk of
T2DM in second versus first generation SA, with WHR making the strongest contribution
(30%) (Table 5, Suppl. figure s3.2C).

1.3.

MixESA

T2DM prevalence was 55% higher in those of MixESA (OR: 1·55 (1·11,2·17)) compared to
Europeans, (Figure 2). WHR was similar in MixESA and Europeans, and markedly lower than
in SA. Residence in the most deprived quintile of deprivation in MixESA was intermediate
(28%) between that of SA (37%) and Europeans (19%), though MixESA had the most years in
education (Table 2). Heights were also intermediate.

1.3.1. Mediation
The analysed data could account for just over a quarter (28%) of the 55% excess risk of T2DM
in MixESA versus Europeans (Table 5, Suppl. Figures s3.2A and s3.3). Deprivation mediated
most of this association (17%), followed by WHR (9%). In contrast the higher educational
status in MixESA compared to Europeans partially mitigated their predisposition to T2DM (7%). A similar proportion of the markedly (71%) lower risk of T2DM in MixESA versus SA
(Figure 2) was accounted for by the above mediators, dominated by WHR (15%) (Table 5,
Suppl. figures s3.2B and s3.4).

2. African Caribbeans
2.1.

African Caribbeans vs Europeans

Similar inter-ethnic differences were observed when comparing people of AC and European
descent (Figure 2, Table 3). Specifically, T2DM risk in AC was three times that of Europeans

(OR: 3·3 (2·7,4·1)). BMI in AC (28·2kg/m2 and 30·8kg/m2 in men and women, respectively) was
higher than in Europeans (27·7kg/m2 in men, 26·7kg/m2 in women). Ever smoking was less
prevalent in AC (16%) than in Europeans (30%). Residence in the bottom Townsend quintile
was over three times greater in AC (70%) than Europeans (21%).

2.2.

Second vs first generation African Caribbeans

Risk of T2DM was 29% lower in second (OR: 0·71 (0·57,0·87) compared to first generation AC
(Figure 2), also with lower BMI (29·1 versus 29·7kg/m2 respectively) (Table 3). Residence in the
lowest quintile of deprivation was marginally lower in second, versus first generation
migrants, (60 vs. 70%). The proportion of ever smokers in second generation AC was double
that of first generation migrants (30% vs. 16%).

2.2.1. Mediation
About a fifth of the 29% lower risk of T2DM in second versus first generation AC was
accounted for, with equal contributions from deprivation and BMI (Table 5, Suppl. figure
s3.6C).

2.3.

MixEAC

T2DM risk in MixEAC was double that of Europeans (OR: 2·06 (1·53,2·78)), but half that of AC
(OR: 0·48 (0·37,0·62)) (Figure 2). BMI in MixEAC (28kg/m2 in both sexes) was close to that of
Europeans (27·8kg/m2 in men, 26·8kg/m2 in women) and lower than in AC (28·3kg/m2 and
30·3kg/m2 in men and women, respectively) (Table 4). Ever smoking was markedly more
prevalent in MixEAC (42%) than in AC (20%) and Europeans (30%). Residence in the bottom
Townsend quintile was highest in AC (63%), intermediate in MixEAC (48%) and lowest in
Europeans (19%). Educational attainment was lowest in MixEAC.

2.3.1. Mediation
About two thirds of the doubling in T2DM prevalence in MixEAC compared to Europeans
could be accounted for, largely by deprivation (42%), and BMI (11%) (Table 5, Suppl. figure

s3.6A). In contrast, about a third of the halving in risk of T2DM in MixEAC versus AC could
be accounted for, mostly by BMI (16%) (Table 5, Suppl. Figure s3.6B).

3. Sensitivity analyses
Using BMI in the SA (instead of WHR) and WHR for the AC (instead of BMI), each accounted
for a lower proportion of the observed difference in T2DM risk than the originally selected
adiposity measure (Suppl. figures s3.5 and s3.7).
Associations and mediation patterns were similar when HbA1c replaced T2DM as the
outcome (Suppl. figures s3.8 and s3.9).
Sensitivity analysis on complete case data (Suppl. figures s4.2 and s4.4) for birthweight
showed that although it made some contribution to T2DM risk, the effect was not as strong as
other mediators included in our main models, though reduced numbers made estimates more
imprecise and restricted detailed analysis.

Discussion
We show that T2DM prevalence was substantially higher in SA and AC compared with
Europeans. Second generation migrants, i.e. those born in the UK, of either SA or AC origin
retain high rates of T2DM, but importantly, these are reduced by about a fifth compared to
the first generation. In contrast, T2DM risks in people of MixESA, and of MixEAC ethnicities
approach those of Europeans.
The ~20% reduction in T2DM risk in second versus first generation migrants is comparable to
the long term effects of either lifestyle (27%) or metformin (18%) intervention on T2DM risk
over 15 years in the Diabetes Prevention Programme (12). In mediation analyses, lower WHR
in second-generation SA migrants appeared to account for a third of their lower risk of T2DM.
In contrast, only a quarter of the reduced T2DM risk in second versus first generation AC
migrants was accounted for by socioeconomic status and lower BMI. The impact of relatively
modest differences in adiposity measures (0.01 for WHR in SA, and 0.6 kg/m2 for BMI in AC),
is striking. Unexplained differences in risk could be due to imprecise measurement of
adiposity status, for example ectopic depots in liver and elsewhere, and socioeconomic
deprivation, lack of such measures across the whole of life, or failure to account for other
unknown exposures which influence T2DM risk. For example, physical activity and diet, the
effects of which may not be wholly mediated by adiposity, although collected in UK Biobank,
lacked precision and were not included in our models. We performed a sensitivity analysis
on the subsample with self-reported birthweight, to capture early life determinants of T2DM,
and observed little impact, though we acknowledge the limitations both of self-report and the
reduced sample size. Importantly, these findings indicate the potential impact of
environmental risk factor modification in addressing the higher rates of T2DM in these ethnic
minority groups, confirming that these risks are not immutable.
In contrast to comparisons between first and second-generation migrants, who differ mainly
in terms of environmental exposures, when comparing mixed ethnic groups, both genetic
backgrounds and environmental exposures are likely to differ. T2DM risks in MixESA are
about 70% lower than SA, and about 50% lower in MixEAC than AC. In both mixed
populations, risks approached those of Europeans (1.5 fold excess in MixESA (versus 4.8017

fold in SAs), and 2.0 fold excess in MixEAC vs 3.30-fold in AC). Much of this residual excess
could be accounted for by continued socioeconomic disadvantage; 28% of MixESA, and 50%
of MixEAC people in this study resided in the most deprived neighbourhoods, compared to
~20% of Europeans. Socioeconomic deprivation contributed to much of the 1/3 and 2/3 excess
of T2DM in MixESA and MixEAC people respectively, with a smaller direct contribution from
adiposity measures (WHR and BMI, respectively). Interestingly, the greater levels of
education in MixESA mitigated somewhat against the potential excess risk of T2DM. In
contrast, markedly more favourable adiposity patterns or levels in the mixed ethnicity
samples, approaching those of Europeans, played a greater part in accounting for the 70%
lower risk of T2DM in MixESA versus SA, and for the halving in risk of T2DM in MixEAC
versus AC.
Previous studies for African ancestry, all from the US, report conflicting findings. While some
claim that only environmental factors (largely socioeconomic status and BMI) determine
ethnic differences in T2DM (13), others aver that genetic factors play a stronger (14) or major
role. There are no comparable studies of people of South Asian ethnicity.
People from ethnic minority groups, be it first generation migrants, their offspring, or those
of mixed ethnicity, continue to experience significant social disadvantage compared to their
white European counterparts.

We show how this markedly increases T2DM risk, but

importantly also show how improvement in social circumstances can reduce the burden of
T2DM, to an extent similar to that observed in response to active lifestyle intervention or
medication.
There are limitations of this analysis. Response rates to UK Biobank were <5%. Responders
are likely to be healthier, and of higher socioeconomic status than non-responders, and this
bias may differ by ethnicity. However, ethnic differences in diabetes prevalence in our study
accord with those of previous, representative population cohorts (2). Further, we observed
marked ethnic differences in socioeconomic deprivation, of similar magnitude to that
anticipated from previous population studies (15). Years of education were derived from
qualification(s) using the ISCED coding, which may not be comparable across countries due
to differential access to educational opportunities, particularly for women. While UKB is

large, numbers of mixed ethnicity, and those of ethnic minority groups who could readily be
matched by age and sex to people of mixed ethnicity, were modest, reducing the power of
analysis. However, the inclusion of those of mixed ethnicity is unique. Measures of diet and
exercise were deemed too imprecise to be included as mediators of the association between
ethnicity and T2DM. There might be unmeasured confounding that was not taken into
account and unquantifiable uncertainty in the percentages explained by mediation analysis.
Although birthweight was not included in the final analysis because of the reduced power
caused by missing data, sensitivity analysis showed the effect of this potential mediator was
unlikely to be strong. Performing a mixed ethnicity and inter-generational analysis, using selfreported ethnicity, is a strength, as it enables the employment of different approaches to
address the same question.
While ethnic specific genetic variants for hyperglycaemia/diabetes have been reported (16–
18) and different effects of known variants observed (19), these currently are insufficient to
account for the observed marked ethnic differences in diabetes risk. It could be that variants
that account for adiposity measures rather than hyperglycaemia/diabetes should be studied,
as the former appears key to accounting for differences in diabetes risk.
Our mixed ethnicity and inter-generational analyses show that environmental risk factors,
largely related to socioeconomic status and obesity, make a strong contribution to ethnic
differences in T2DM risk. Relatively modest differences in risk factors in second-generation
migrants and in those of mixed ethnicity are associated with appreciably lower risks of T2DM.
This effect is similar to that achieved by effective pharmaceutical interventions and provides
evidence that the ethnic minority predisposition to diabetes is highly mutable.
