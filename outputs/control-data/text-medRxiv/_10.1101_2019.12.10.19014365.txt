Abstract

Polygenic scores are a strategy to aggregate the small, additive effects of single nucleotide
polymorphisms across the genome. With phenotypes like Alzheimer’s disease, which have a
strong and well established genomic locus (APOE), the cumulative effect of genetic variants
outside of this area has not been well established in a population-representative sample. Here
we examine the association between polygenic scores both with and without the APOE region
at different P value thresholds. We also investigate the addition of APOE-ε4 carrier status and
its effect on the polygenic score – dementia association. We found that including the APOE
region through weighted variants in a polygenic score was insufficient to capture the large
amount of risk attributed to this region. We recommend removing this region from polygenic
score calculation and treating the APOE locus as an independent covariate.

Introduction
The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), representing roughly
65% of dementia cases (Van Cauwenberghe, Van Broeckhoven, & Sleegers, 2016). AD is
thought to arise from a combination of both genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors (Gatz et
al., 2006). The estimated heritability of late onset Alzheimer’s disease is around 74% (Gatz et
al., 1997). While large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several
genetic loci associated with AD (Harold et al., 2009; Jansen et al., 2019; Kunkle et al., 2019;
Lambert et al., 2013; Naj et al., 2011; Seshadri et al., 2010; Tosto et al., 2017), being a carrier
of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE-ε4) allele remains the strongest genetic predictor of AD (Ward et
al., 2012). One copy of APOE-ε4 (inheriting a CC at these two locations from either parent)
confers a 3-fold risk of AD while two copies (inheriting a CC at these two locations from both
parent) a 15-fold increase in risk (Liu, Liu, Kanekiyo, Xu, & Bu, 2013). The effect of APOE-ε4 is
all the more difficult to capture in a single variant GWAS as APOE-ε4 is a haplotype composed
of two SNPs: rs7412 and rs429358 – which will never be fully be captured in a traditional linear
model GWAS framework. However, in GWAS many independent SNPs have been identified in
and near the APOE gene locus. The APOE gene region contains many variants in high linkage
disequilibrium within roughly 100 kilobases, including several additional high-risk sites in the
translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) gene.
The largest AD GWAS meta-analysis to date (N=94,437) is the from the International
Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP) (Kunkle et al., 2019). This meta-analysis confirmed 20
previously identified AD risk loci (Lambert et al., 2013) and identified five new genome-wide loci
including (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX). The IGAP used a three-stage
strategy where Stage 1 consisted of genotyped and imputed data on 9,456,058 common and
2,024,574 rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to meta-analyze GWAS from four
cohorts (ncases=21,982; ncontrols=41,944). Stage 2 included replication with a custom I-select

genotyping chip developed in Lambert et al. 2013 (Lambert et al., 2013) and included 11,632
variants and 18,845 individuals with a meta-analysis of Stage 1 and Stage 2. Finally, Stage 3
replicated 44 variants and meta-analyzed Stages 1 and 2 and 3 for a total of 35,274 cases and
59,163 controls. The associations between millions of genetic loci and AD are documented in
IGAP and available for testing in independent populations.
Many complex diseases may result from the consideration of small individual effects
across the genome. Polygenic scores (PGS) are generally derived from the sum of weighted
variants across an individual (International Schizophrenia et al., 2009; Martin, Daly, Robinson,
Hyman, & Neale, 2019). Though conceptually simple, many analytic decisions contribute to
different qualities of PGSs including different coefficient of variation (R2), correlations between
scores, and areas under the curve. An important consideration for diseases such as Alzheimer’s
disease – which have a genetic locus like APOE/TOMM40 conferring much of the genetic risk to
the disease – is to determine how the remaining variants in the genome contribute to the
disease. Removing a region with many risk variants and deciding which and how many variants
to include in a PGS can offer substantively different conclusions. For instance, one study
reported a PGS area under the curve of 0.57 for Alzheimer’s disease (parental proxy) using 21
SNPs and excluding the APOE region (Tosto et al., 2017), while another study reported using
more than 200,000 variants (including APOE) and a PGS area under the curve of 0.84 for
Alzheimer’s disease (Escott-Price, Myers, Huentelman, & Hardy, 2017). Alzheimer’s disease
has a strong genetic locus and the rest of the genome’s polygenic contribution has not been
benchmarked across metrics of PGS construction.
Alzheimer’s disease PGS has not been assessed in population-based studies of
dementia, other than by proxy in the UK Biobank cohort (Jansen et al.), and PGS construction
metrics regarding the APOE region and additional SNPs have not been compared. The goals of
this manuscript are three-fold. The first aim is to assess the utility of using polygenic scores in

population-based analyses of dementia. The second aim is to evaluate the inclusion of the
APOE region in these polygenic scores with and without a covariate modeling risk directly from
the APOE-ε4 allele. The third aim is to test SNP inclusion thresholds in PGS on dementia. We
conduct this analysis using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the European ancestries
participants.

Methods
Health and Retirement Study
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally representative panel study
featuring a biennial survey of adults over age 50 and their spouses in the United States (HRS,
2019). The HRS is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA U01AG009740) and is
conducted by the University of Michigan. The HRS was established in 1992 as a means to
provide a national resource for data on changing health and economic circumstances
associated with ageing at both the individual and population levels. These changes are focused
on four broads topics: income and wealth; health, cognition, and use of healthcare services;
work and retirement; and family connections (Sonnega et al., 2014).
A random one-half of the sample was pre-selected to receive an enhanced face-to-face
interview in 2006 which included physical performance tests, anthropometric measurements,
blood and saliva samples, and a psychosocial self-administered questionnaire in addition to the
HRS core interview. The remaining one-half sample was interviewed using the same enhanced
face-to-face protocol in 2008. The new cohort in 2010 was also randomly assigned to receive an
enhanced face-to-face interview in either 2010 or 2012. Those participants who were not
interviewed or did not consent to saliva in 2006 were asked again in 2010.
Salivary DNA was collected using Oragene-250 saliva kits and protocol. DNA extracted
from the saliva and was genotyped at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) using

the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 array (8v1 and 4v1). Genotyping Quality Control was performed by
the Genetics Coordinating Center at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. SNP annotation
aligned to genome build 37/hg 19. Genetic principal components (PC) were calculated with
HapMap controls (Patterson, Price, & Reich, 2006; Price et al., 2006). In addition to selecting
independent SNPs with missing call rates < 5% and minor allele frequencies > 5%, the 2q21
(LCT), HLA, 8p23, and 17q21.31 regions were excluded from the initial pool (CIDR, 2013). The
final European ancestries sample includes all self-reported non-Hispanic White persons that
had PC loadings within ± one standard deviations of the mean for eigenvectors one and two in
the PC analysis of all unrelated study subjects. Once the non-Hispanic White, European
ancestries sample was identified, PCs were then re-calculated within this group to further
account for population stratification. These “ancestry-specific principal components” were used
in subsequent analyses. Imputation was performed using IMPUTE2 on HRS data phased using
SHAPEIT2. Data were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) cosmopolitan reference
panel phase 3 version 5 (initial release on May 2013, haplotypes released Oct 2014) and are
available on the database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP,
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/, phs000428.v2.p2).
APOE-ε4
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene codes for a protein that binds and transports lowdensity lipids and is responsible, in part, for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream (Huang
& Mahley, 2014; Mahley, 1988). Variations in this gene affect cholesterol metabolism and may
lead to increases in the risk for stroke, heart disease, and may alter the odds of having
Alzheimer’s disease. The APOE genotype is defined by two variants (rs7412 and rs429358)
resulting in three common isoforms of APOE: APOE-ε2, APOE-ε3, and APOE-ε4. Of note, the
genotyped rs7412 and rs429358 variants failed genotyping quality control in the HRS pipeline
and are therefore not included as individual variants in any PGS using genotyped data alone.

Using the imputed rs7412 (IMPUTE2 INFO score=0.988) and rs429358 (IMPUTE2 INFO
score=0.99) variants, we categorized HRS participants as ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε2/ε4, ε3/ε3, ε3/ε4, and
ε4/ε4. We analyze two indicator variables for presence of one ε4 allele (1=yes, 0=no) or two ε4
allele (1=yes, 0=no).
Polygenic Score for Alzheimer’s disease
We investigate using genome-wide raw genotyped variants and the two imputed APOE
variants (rs7412 and rs429358) in the creation of our PGSs. We include SNPs in our PGS
analysis at two AD-SNP association p-value thresholds (pT) from the Kunkle et al 2019
summary statistics: pT=0.01 and pT=1.0. PGSs at pT=0.01 include only those variants for which
the association p-value in the IGAP meta-analysis on AD was less than 0.01. Summary
statistics were obtained from National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data
Storage Site https://www.niagads.org/datasets/ng00075. Importantly, our study sample was not
included in the Kunkle study of clinical Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the weights are independent
of our study sample. We do not include any linkage disequilibrium thresholding in our scores
(i.e. no clumping or pruning algorithms). That is, we include any variants that pass quality
control from the HRS and overlap with those variants from the AD GWAS summary statistics in
our scores, unless otherwise noted.
For our scores with the APOE gene region removed, we removed all variants from the
summary statistics on chromosome 19 (45,384,477 to 45,432,606, build 37/hg 19). This
represents the start position of TOMM40 (45,394,477) -10 kilobases and the stop position of
APOC1 (45,422,606) +10 kilobases. This region was removed in its entirety due to the dense
linkage disequilibrium block in European ancestries overlapping these three genes (TOMM40,
APOE, APOC1). We compare four PGSs: genotyped PGS including the APOE gene region,
genotyped PGS with APOE region removed, each at two SNP p-values of significance pT=1
and pT< 0.01 (Figure 1).

Cognition Status
The HRS used a multidimensional measure of cognitive functioning, based on a
telephone screen named the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (Brandt, Spencer, &
Folstein, 1998). Domains assessed using this measure include: memory, mental status, abstract
reasoning, fluid reasoning, vocabulary, dementia, and numeracy. In 2009, Langa, Kabeto, and
Weir developed an approach for defining dementia and cognitively impaired non-dementia
(CIND) in the HRS. This method has been clinically validated using equipercentile equating in
the HRS against the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) – a sub-sample of the
HRS who received a more extensive neurological battery and was evaluated by a team of
dementia experts (Langa, Kabeto, & Weir, 2009; Langa et al., 2005). For self-respondents, the
score consists of overall cognitive test performance while the proxy respondents’ scores are
composed of proxy-rated memory, interviewer-perceived cognition, and impaired activities of
daily living. The cut points for this method reflect the prevalence of dementia or cognitive
impairment to the expected population prevalence from the ADAMS study. We used repeated
measures of the classification of cognitive function data contributed for assessment years 2000
– 2014 from the HRS imputed cognition researcher contribution data set (Langa, Weir, Kabeto,
& Sonnega, November 2018). For self-respondents, a score from 0 to 6 is categorized as
dementia, 7 to 11 is categorized as cognitive impaired not dementia, and 12 to 27 is categorized
as normal cognition. For proxy respondents starting in 2000, a score of 6 or higher out of 11 is
classified as having dementia, a score of 3 to 5 indicates cognitive impaired not dementia, while
0 to 2 indicates normal cognition (Langa et al., 2009). In this analysis, we are only testing the
odds of dementia versus normal cognition (1=dementia, 0=normal cognition).
Covariates
Education attainment (years of school), birth cohort (AHEAD: Asset and Health
Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (b. <1924); CODA: Children of the Depression (b. 1924-1930);

HRS: Health and Retirement Study – original cohort (b. 1931-1941); WB: War babies (b. 19421947); EBB: early baby boomers (b. 1948-1953); MBB: mid-baby boomers (b. 1954-1959)), and
sex (0=female, 1=male) are measured at the baseline HRS exam. Age (years) and a self-report
of doctor diagnosed stroke (0=none, 1=stroke, possible stroke/TIA/mini-strokes, respondent
disputes previous waves that indicate condition) are assessed at the same wave as the
corresponding cognition visit.
Statistical analysis
Due to the repeated measures in this analysis, we use generalized linear models and
the GENMOD procedure in SAS 9.4. We specify repeated measures on the individual, a
binomial distribution, and a logit link with an unstructured correlation structure. Fixed effects
covariates included in every model included sex, years of education, and five ancestry-specific
principal components. The time varying covariates chronological age, year, and stroke history at
each interview wave are also included in every model. We use an α of 0.05 as a threshold for
significance.

Results
There are 9,872 individuals in the HRS non-Hispanic White, European ancestry analytic
sample collected between 2006 and 2010. We removed observations with missing cognition
(m=10,958), observations where the cognitive status was classified as CIND (m=6,905), and
observations with a missing stroke status (m=16). This removed 55 additional individuals from
the analysis. The final analysis included n=9,817 HRS respondents of predominantly European
ancestries with m=51,225 cognitive observations (Figure 2).
Our analytic sample was 57.8% female with an average age of 63.3 (SD=10.3) at their
first visit during the observation period. On average, participants had 13.2 (2.5) years of
education. The average number of cognitive assessments per participant was 5.2. A small

portion of the sample had a history of stroke at their first visit during the observation period
(n=417, 4.3%), with a higher proportion of males reporting a history of stroke at their first visit
(n=201, 4.9%) than females (n=216, 3.8%). In unadjusted analyses, the AD PGS at either pvalue threshold (pT) was not significantly different between males and females and broadly
centered at zero with a standard deviation of one (pT=0.01, P=0.402; pT=1.0, P=0.71). There
was no difference in the distribution of number of copies of APOE-ε4 by sex, where the overall
proportion with one copy of APOE-ε4 was 24.3% (n=2382), and two copies of APOE-ε4 was
2.1% (n=210). Across all observations, accounting for repeated measures within individuals,
age, and dementia at first visit during the observation period were not significantly different by
sex. The proportion of stroke; however, was significantly different by sex (P=0.0004) with a
higher proportion in males than in females (Table 1). APOE-ε4 status is associated (Ps<.05)
with PGS (Figure 3).
In adjusted repeated measures regression models, increased age, later year of
observation, history of stroke, and lower education were associated with increased odds of
dementia in all models (all P<0.0001; Table 2). In the models using an AD PGS with the APOE
region included, having one copy of APOE-ε4 increased the odds of dementia relative to normal
cognition by roughly 2 fold (AD PGS pT=0.01, OR=2.1 95%CI 1.8 to 2.5; AD PGS pT=1,
OR=2.2 95%CI 1.9 to 2.6; Table 2), while two copies of APOE-ε4 increased the odds of
dementia by over 4 fold (AD PGS pT=0.01, OR=4.5 95%CI 2.9 to 6.9]; AD PGS pT=1, OR=4.9
95%CI 3.2 to 7.5; Table 2), holding all other variables constant. The AD PGS with the APOE
region included was marginally associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal
cognition only for the pT cutoff of 0.01 (OR=1.1 95%CI 1.0 to 1.2), while the AD PGS at pT=1
was not significantly associated with the odds of dementia. In the models that utilized the AD
PGS with the APOE region removed, we observed similar estimates for one and two copies of
APOE-ε4 as before, and a similar 9% increase in the odds of dementia for every one standard

deviation increase in the AD PGS at pT=0.01 (OR=1.1 95%CI 1.0 to 1.2). The AD PGS at pT=1
was not associated with the odds of dementia, relative to normal cognition in this sample.
Because it has been demonstrated that there is mortality selection in the oldest
individuals in the HRS genetic sample (Domingue et al., 2017), we removed the two oldest
cohorts (AHEAD and CODA) as a sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Table 1). A total of
2,020 individuals and 8,957 observations were removed. The effect of any copy of APOE-ε4
remained highly associated with the odds of dementia compared to normal cognition. Though
the effect size for the AD PGSs at each pT and whether or not the APOE region were not
significantly different than those in Table 2, the p-values associated with these effects were
non-significant for all AD PGS. The slightly attenuated effects are not surprising as the younger
cohorts are just now entering ages at which dementia becomes more prevalent.

Discussion
In a large, population-based cohort of older, European ancestry Americans, cumulative
genetic risk summarized as a PGS is informative of longitudinal dementia risk. We observed
that the APOE region requires handling with care in the development of PGS. Specifically,
including the APOE region as weighted SNPs in a PGS was insufficient to account for the large
risk attributed to the APOE region. We recommend removing the region in linkage disequilibrium
around the APOE locus from the PGS and treating the APOE locus as an independent
covariate. In addition, we observed greater performance from PGS developed with a more
stringent threshold p-value for SNP inclusion, with greater noise from a PGS informed by the full
genome in association with this dementia phenotype. Optimized measures of the polygenic
nature of dementia allow for more powerful interrogations of genetic and environmental risk for
dementia.

We observed the APOE-ε4 allele was longitudinally associated with higher risk of
dementia, in a dose dependent manner. This observation is consistent with extensive prior
research (Logue et al., 2019; Tanzi & Bertram, 2001). The APOE-ε4 allele is neither necessary,
nor sufficient to cause dementia, but the magnitude of increased risk attributed to each copy of
the allele is relatively high. The APOE-ε4 allele is in linkage disequilibrium with a 100 kilobase
region involving the APOE, APOEC, and TOMM40 genes. Thus, an APOE independent PGS
would need to remove the SNPs from the entire APOE region. In excess of the association
between the APOE region and dementia, we observed a small, but significant association
between AD PGS and dementia. These findings are similar to those observed in clinical
populations investigating APOE independent PGS risk of Alzheimer’s disease specifically
(Cruchaga et al., 2018; Desikan et al., 2017; Escott-Price et al., 2017; Lupton et al., 2016; Tan
et al., 2018). When building PGS, it is important to have independent study samples between
the discovery GWAS and the application PGS. Notably, our study sample was part of the
Kunkle GWAS that generated the weights for the PGS. Our findings show the APOE
independent AD PGS can be successfully implemented in population-based research of a broad
dementia phenotype.
Dementia is a disorder with a strong genetic locus of effect (APOE) and substantially
weaker effects are scattered throughout the genome. Including the APOE region in PGS without
specific measurement of APOE-ε4 is insufficient, and overestimates the polygenic nature of
dementia. Similarly, in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) there is a strong main effect locus
(C9orf72), and a significant, albeit modest, proportion of the phenotypic variance could be
explained by polygenic risk score, over and above the C9orf72 region (van Rheenen et al.,
2016). In contrast, other chronic disease traits, such as obesity, lack a dominant genetic locus
and polygenic score development is successful across the entire genome at a higher p-value
threshold (Ware et al., 2017). Together, these results suggest that in traits with a strong genetic

locus, polygenic scores should exclude the primary regions and seek to aggregate the
remaining genetic risk as a separate predictor.
Our research has several limitations that should be acknowledged. The first is that our
study relied on imputed APOE variant calls. The APOE region is notoriously difficult and labor
intensive to measure genotypes (Radmanesh et al., 2014; Zhong et al., 2016). Indeed, the two
primary APOE SNPs of interest failed quality control metrics on the genotyping array in the
HRS. We used the correlation structure of the genome from the 1000GP reference to impute
these SNPs with ~99% confidence. Second, our study may be subject to mortality selection;
however, dementia is primarily a disease of older age and requires survival long enough to
manifest symptoms. Mortality selection related to the APOE genotype would only serve to
make our observations more conservative. Third, our PGS was developed using weights from a
GWAS of primarily European ancestry participants, thereby limiting generalizability to other
acnestries. Last, our population-based study assessed a broad phenotype of dementia. There
are many types of dementia including Alzheimer’s, vascular, and frontotemporal lobe, which
have varying genetic architectures, to which we applied a PGS specific for Alzheimer’s. As
future GWAS become available for dementia subtypes in a clinical population, investigators may
be able to classify the utility of PGS in dementia subtypes.
Dementia has considerable risk attributed to genetic factors. The APOE region is the
strongest locus associated with disease and many additional sites confer small risk effects.
Incorporating genetic risk from many sites in a polygenic risk score is a useful metric for risk
prediction and etiologic testing in epidemiologic research of complex traits (Maher, 2015). Our
findings demonstrate the APOE region should be removed prior to polygenic risk score
development and treated as an independent factor in dementia analyses. More work is needed
to assess polygenic scores for Alzheimer’s disease for clinical utility and prediction and in
diverse ancestries.

P-values for dementia and stroke are from a repeated measures model with a binary distribution and
logit link, unstructured correlation structure and repeated individual model to test for differences by sex.
For Age, a two-step process where the mean age for each person across all visits was calculated, and
then a t-test was performed on the resulting individual-means by sex.

AHEAD: Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old; CODA: Children of the Depression Age; OR: Odds ratio estimate for dementia
relative to normal cognition; SE: standard error; CI: confidence interval; P: p-value for the OR estimate; APOE: Apolipoprotein E; AD: Alzheimer’s
disease; pT: p-value threshold for SNP-outcome association from the Alzheimer’s disease meta-analysis for inclusion into the polygenic score.
All models were additionally adjusted for five ancestry-specific principal components. Generalized linear models accounted for repeated measures
by individual and used a binomial distribution, logit link, and unstructured correlation structure.
