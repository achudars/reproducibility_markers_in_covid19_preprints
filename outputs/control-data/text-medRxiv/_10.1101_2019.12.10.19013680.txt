Abstract
Anorectal malformations (ARM) are individually common but Congenital Pouch Colon
(CPC), a rare anorectal anomaly causes a dilated pouch in genitourinary tract. We
have earlier attempted to understand the clinical genetic makeup of CPC and
identified genes responsible for the disease using whole exome sequencing (WES).
Here we report our studies of CPC, by identifying de novo heterozygous missense
mutations in 16 proband-parent trios and further discover variants of unknown
significance which could provide insights into CPC manifestation and its etiology.
Our study confirms candidate mutations in genes, viz. C7orf57, C10orf120, C9orf84
and MUC16, CTC1 particularly emphasizing the role of hypothetical genes or open
reading frames causing this developmental disorder. Variant validation revealed
disease causing mutations associated with CPC and genitourinary diseases which
could close the gaps of surgery in bringing intervention in therapies.

Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) has been an invaluable and cost-effective genomic
approach to identify genetic variants responsible for both Mendelian and polygenic
diseases (Ng et al., 2010). In the recent past, it has allowed detecting clinically
relevant genomic regions spanning the known unknowns regions, diseaseassociated sites and untranslated regions (UTRs) (Shen et al., 2014). In addition to
the well known diseases, prenatal abnormalities, structural anomalies and
congenital defects were studied demonstrating a good diagnostic yield (Greenbaum
et al., 2019; Mone et al., 2018). While WES approaches are abundant, they are
limited if the disease in question is characteristically rare and medically
inconclusive. This could be deterrent because of the challenges in variant discovery,
including rare and low-frequency mutations using next generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies. Recent decrease in cost of WES and accuracy of the NGS has enabled
the researchers to study trios (proband/parents) or quad, in case of an addition of
sibling to discover single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and indels. In the recent past,
several research groups reported genetic diagnosis for rare disorders using WES
applications while a few used characteristic trio-exome analysis to infer the
candidate or driver mutations (Boycott et al., 2013; Gahl et al., 2012; Jacob et al.,
2013). With human disease and genetic variation studies largely driven by NGS, a
paramount challenge would be to explore de novo mutations, i.e. those inherited
from either father or mother. To check this, parent-child trios/quad WES analysis
could be a powerful approach although biases impede identifying potential de novo
mutations. Nevertheless, a majority of mutations may not transcend from parent to
offspring making comprehensive genetic variants to be analyzed for confirming
them as causal (MacArthur et al., 2014). The trio-based exome sequencing has
provided a benefit for identifying de novo variants in rare diseases attributing them
to be heterozygous/causal mutations (Zhu et al., 2015). For rare diseases, although
WES analysis often makes assumptions regarding disease inheritance (de novo vs.
recessive), variant frequency and genetic heterogeneity, it has opened the path
towards improved disease management or prognosis and effective therapies. For
example, WES trios in schizophrenia patients for recessive genotypes were studied
with rare mutations in voltage gated sodium ion channels contributing to the
disorder (Rees et al., 2015). In another study, Jin et al. (2017) have identified the
pathogenic mutations with an increased rate of de novo mutations in early-onset
high myopia (EOHM) patients (Jin et al., 2017). Recently, Quinlan-Jones et al. have

correlated the probandâ€“parent trios to determine the clinical utility of molecular
autopsy underlying etiology of structural anomalies (Quinlan-Jones et al., 2019).
Congenital Pouch Colon (CPC) is a rare type of high anorectal malformation wherein
a part of or entire colon gets dilated in the form of pouch having fistular
communication with genitor-urinary tract (Mathur et al., 2002). Most of the
incidences have been reported from India with cases common to other countries
accounted although the males are prone to be largely affected, i.e. male to female
ratio of 4:1 (Gupta and Sharma, 2007). From WES approaches, we have earlier
identified mutations that are causal to CPC and reported candidate missense and
nonsense mutations in genes, viz. C7orf57, C10orf120, C9orf84 and MUC16, CTC1
respectively (Mathur et al., 2018). In a separate study, we have also inferred the
role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from a WES and identified lnc-EPB41-1-1,
located in the intergenic regions of EPB41 that is known to be interacting with
KIF13A (Gupta et al., 2018). In this extended WES study of CPC, we examine the role
of de novo mutations in a 16 proband/parent trio family comparing the mutations to
that of their unaffected parents. Keeping in view of understanding the genetic basis
of CPC that could possibly delve into phenotypic variation, an attempt was made to
discover a number of de novo variants contributing to the heterogeneity. We
identified mutations spanning the orphan open reading frames (ORFs), and a few
frame shift mutations, besides mutations in GBA3 and HAVCR1 associated with
intestine and urogenital tissues.
Results and Discussion
The downstream analyses leading to the variant calling was done carefully to yield
the list of final number of variants. We achieved a mean read depth of 80 in the
targeted regions for an average depth of coverage 110x. We generated a norm of
840667 total variants comprising 775262 SNPs and 65405 indels per exome in
probands as compared to 736820 SNPs and 63418 indels in unaffected samples
from a total of 777216 variants (Figure 1; see methods). Missense variants
constituted the large variation followed by loss of function variants in cases when
compared to unaffected samples, with an overall 0.35% missense, 0.02%
frameshift, 0.004% stop gain and 0.0009% stop lost (Table 1). From the final list of
inferring causality, we identified 40 SNPs/ indels with a few non-synonymous

mutations as a result of low quality calls (Table 2) which in turn were mapped to 37
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (Table 3) and 385 copy number variants (CNVs)
(Table 4). Given the rare phenotype, the frequency of the confirmed variants was
checked for in agreement with that of 1000 genome and ExAC databases. From the
reported familial history, the relatedness tests were not felt necessary as the
pedigree confirmed correct parenthood for all affected/unaffected samples with the
shared homozygosis (Figure 2 and supplementary table 1). Finally, a set of
candidate variants inferred from all samples were checked for validation using
Sequenom array/plex (Table 5).

please refer supplementary Table 1 for details)
We found two independent lines of evidence from various tools and reached
consensus in detecting variants from each samples with all filtering steps. For
example, the pathogenic mutations contributing to the each relevant proband were
screened first. Altogether, we observed that MUC3A, TAF1B, in addition to the two
hypothetical protein-coding genes, viz. C10orf120 and C9orf84, contribute to CPC
and these could be interesting as they could be novel genes responsible for
pathogenesis of CPC. Although from dbSNP, we checked whether or not the SNPs
are missense/frameshift variants, we attempted to validate them according to their
clinical/pathogenic significance besides checking the heterozygous mutations for
minor allele frequencies (MAF<0.01). Among them, 11 variants were already
reported in dbSNP (C7orf57, C10orf120, C7orf31, C9orf84, C11orf96, OR5AR1,
TAF1B, MUC3A, DLC1, AK9, FGFR4, KRTAP4-1) whereas AK9 was found to be de novo
in two probands (Z19 and Z99) with another putative de novo variant, viz. FRG1,
which was later found to be a false positive post Sequenom validation. In summary,
we observed FRG1 and AK9 as de novo variants in CPC-XI and CPC-XII, CPC-XVI
families. While FRG1 is a protein coding gene involved in mRNA transport and
processing linked with epigenetic regulation of muscle differentiation by regulating
histone-lysine N-methyltransferase activity (Sun et al., 2011), it is associated with
disease pathogenesis and its over-expression leads to development of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD1)-like symptoms. On the other hand,
AK9 is involved in nucleotide metabolism pathways and maintains homeostasis of
cellular nucleotides (Amiri et al., 2013).
One of the important challenges for researchers and clinicians nowadays in
investigating rare disorders involves predicting pathogenicity of variants of

unknown significance (VUS). With several guidelines mentioned for predicting
pathogenicity of variants (Landrum et al., 2016; MacArthur et al., 2014; Richards et
al., 2015), molecular investigators face a daunting task in considering a rare variant
as benign or pathogenic and inferring them to pathogenesis. In rare diseases, where
only a minority of population is getting affected and also prevalent to a specific
geographical location, identifying and considering VUS will require a thoughtful
consideration. In our study, candidate variants such as SQSTM1 (rs10277) , GBA3,
FGFR4 and HAVCR1 are shown to be reported in urogenital and colon related
disorders and are not reported as deleterious in most of the pathogenicity
determination databases (Supplementary figure 1). A notable among them, viz.
sequestome (SQSTM1 or P62) gene encodes a multifunctional scaffolding protein
involved in multiple cellular processes (Sanz et al., 1999) besides showing
mitochondrial integrity, import and dynamics as a discriminating autophagy
receptor (Seibenhener et al., 2013). In addition, p62/SQSTM1 is expressed
ubiquitously in various cell types such as cytoplasm, nucleus and lysosomes (Pankiv
et al., 2010) and is known to be over expressed in various human genitourinary
diseases including colon cancer (Mohamed et al., 2015), hepatocellular carcinoma
(Bao et al., 2014) and prostate cancer (Kitamura et al., 2006) (Supplementary Table
2). Although multiple lines of evidence, suggest that apart from VUS, mutations
yielding somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) could not be ruled, we found these
missense mutations in C7orf57, C9orf84, ORF5AR1, FGFR4, HLA-DRB5, NOTCH2NLA,
MUC5B genes associated with CPC. Interestingly, we observed CNVs in CDC27, HLADRB5 and MST1L genes with maximum number of gains and losses (Table 4).
Particularly, CDC27, a Cdk-inhibitory kinase of the anaphase-promoting complex is
known to be associated with colon inactivation.
To confer the mutations associated with pathogenesis, we observed that C7orf31,
OR5AR1, PABPC1, CTBP2 and NOTCH2NLA genes harbor deleterious mutations
which were screened through SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationTaster, Ensembl VEP, Phred
CADD score (>18) GERP score and COSMIC prediction tools (Table 2). Interestingly,
CTBP2 gene which has a heterozygous missense mutation (rs61870306; c.G1147C;
p.N249K) was predicted as lethal with Polyphen score of 0.996 showing high
conservation among species. Therefore, we considered to model the PDB structure
with these mutations showing unfavorable free energy change (Î”Î”G) with reduced

between nearby amino acids and other surrounding residues could ultimately
reduce the protein stability.

Dissecting the genetic architecture of a rare disease is certainly an arduous task.
Our CPC exome analyses that we have done was intended to fill this gap to detect
mutations, SNVs to chromosomal aberrations affecting the focal genes/loci.
Assessing these variants in CPC has provided an ample evidence of strata coherent
to CPC traits. In our study, at least 4 of the 40 confirmed variants from trio-exome
analysis were reported in colon related ailments viz. DLC1, HAVCR1, FGFR4 and
GBA3. While we have aimed to characterize the variants by employing different
approaches, a polygenic model is assumed. This could be compounded with two
assumptions (a) capturing exomes and identifying deleterious mutations from high
depth of coverage exome and (b) identifying large cohort of mutations that fall in
low depth of coverage exomes. Though we observed both classes of genetic
variation contributing to the etiology of the disease, inferring proband-parent trios
and detecting de novo and transmitted genetic variants is quite a challenge. By
considering rare variants and adopting a strategy of identifying them in high depth
exome, we validated all the 16 trios. Nevertheless, we could not compare the
detection yield inherent to these spectrums of patients owing to lack of CPC
phenotype and trio-exome studies of similar design. Although previous studies have
shown relatively similar methods, they detected medically relevant variants in
majority of the diseased phenotypes (Jin et al., 2017). Our findings are in agreement
with a large number of reports for rare variants, suggesting that cumulative

contribution of de novo variants across different genes is associated with distinct
phenotypes.
One of the interesting findings that have emerged from our study is the role of the
known unknowns or hypothetical genes establishing their roles in various diseases.
A notable among them is C10orf120 gene which harbors CTCF binding site even as
these mutations remain undefined for most disease types including cancer (Guo et
al., 2018). We observe that there is significant enrichment of indels associated with
intestinal/colon related-specific genes as these mutations are widespread in tissues
showing chromosomal instability, co-occurring with neighbouring chromosomal
aberrations, and are frequent in colon, rectum and gastrointestinal tumours but rare
in other diseases. We argue that this mutational disruption associated with CTCF
binding sites could be associated with pathogenesis as it appears to be conserved
in a majority of CPC probands (Supplementary Table 3). A careful check in Ensembl
regulatory feature reveals that the C/T mutation was experimentally validated in
mouse (supplementary figure 2) supporting the aforementioned argument. Another
orphan ORF, viz. C7orf31 also harbours CTCF binding sites and this is in agreement
with the fact that the functional pathway analysis showed significant enrichment for
biological processes associated with regulation wherein most of our variants are
known to be associated with cellular and metabolic pathways (Table 6).
Interestingly, we observed that these two ORFs (C10orf120 and C7orf31) are
localized to mitochondria and so we asked if there is a plausible role of hypothetical
ORFs harboring candidate mutations inherited from mother (rs2947594 and
rs2285738). On the other hand, we argue that these mutations are largely
autosomal dominant/ de novo with a few x-linked or mitochondrial or maternally
inherited genes (Supplementary Table 4). Among them, fibroblast growth factor
receptor 4 gene (FGFR4) is known to be associated with genitourinary diseases.
Although their maternal association cannot be ruled out, we construe that these
candidate genes could be promising biomarkers as precursors of CPC. In addition,
we screened our variants from Indian Genome Variant Database (IGVDB) and found
that they are already reported in Indian subpopulation (Brahmachari et al., 2005)
and this stratification allowed us to review the patterns influencing common and
rare variants. In principle, the rare variants were found to have stronger patterns
when compared to the common variants. Thus, there is an inherent need to study

the mutations in the known unknown regions which would possibly delve into
understanding rare diseases.
To gain insights into the role of lncRNAs, we revisited our hypothesis from erstwhile
study16 and reconfirmed whether or not NONHSAT002007 was inferred in WES
samples with predictions from the NONCODE database. While we did not find
mutations in lncRNAs from trio-exome analyses, we argue that the mutations in
essential genes tend to be causal for rare diseases paving way for driver mutations
with the mutations in non-coding genes suppressed for selective pressure. On a
different note, we aimed to evaluate exome enrichment to that of transcriptome
and anticipated if any of the variants seen from our WES study could be associated
with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). From the transcriptome pair of CPC
type-4 (proband and its unaffected parent), we observed several transcripts,
alternative splice variants and fusion genes but none of them could be associated
with the causal genes inferred from exome study (Supplementary Table 5). Although
we found RGPD2 and RGPD4 genes known to be significantly associated with
bowel/colon as among the top enriched, nevertheless it is hypothetical to confirm
this inferring global gene expression from just a pair of dataset. This approach, if
studied on all samples, we believe, could identify transcripts present at low levels,
which in fact could be associated with the pathogenesis of CPC.
In conclusion, we argue that the genetic variability in CPC has had a remarkable
significance not only with the parents but also within each proband. The discovery
of

Methods
Trio selection
The CPC subjects were recruited from the SPJMC (J.K. Lon Hospital), SMS Medical
College, Jaipur in accordance with a protocol approved by the institutional ethics
committee (IEC) of the hospital. A written informed consent was provided by the
parents on behalf of their children. The blood samples were collected from all the
probands, parents and unaffected siblings if any. The WES data from a total of 64
samples including 16 affected neonates with their parents and unaffected siblings

were used for the study. Although all samples had unaffected sibling samples and
data, we restricted our pool of analyses to probands (11 male and 5 female) and
unaffected parents/sibling. The methods and pipeline leading to family/quad
analyses is summarized in Figure 4 (Supplementary Methods).
Variant annotation, filtering and quality control
The details of sequencing and variant calling in CPC subjects have been previously
described 15. Briefly, WES was performed on Illumina multiplexed sequencer with
paired-end chemistry and 110x effective coverage. Using our in-house developed
pipeline, all unmapped sequence reads were aligned to the human reference
genome (hg38) and variants were called. The mutations from WES study were
manually checked to discover the variants, if any across the samples. To start with,
de novo variants were interpreted using â€˜grepâ€™ and awk liner commands, if present
in probands but absent in their respective parents (Supplementary information).
After manually checking the variants, we confined the prioritization of variants to an
average depth of 50 across all the trio samples. Further checking with dbSNP
(Sherry et al., 2001), ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2016) and COSMIC (Tate et al., 2019)
databases, we used SNP-Nexus (Chelala et al., 2009) to filter mutations listed in a
cohort of databases, viz. SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2003), PolyPhen-2 (Adzhubei et al.,
2010), Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (McLaren et al., 2016), MutationTaster
(Schwarz et al., 2014), CADD (Kircher et al., 2014) and GERP (Cooper et al., 2005),
and confirmed the pathogenic mutations, if they are deleterious in nature. The CNVs
and VUS were inferred by mapping the final list of variants to SNP-Nexus. As a final
check in reaching consensus for the common variants across all the probands, we
compared the variants from multiple bioinformatics tools so as to find bona fide
variants at the union of intersection of these methods which we construe them to
be causal.

homozygous for the specific allele. Enrichment analysis of data was done to
calculate inclusive of parameters like binomial probability, hyper geometric
distribution (Huang et al., 2009). After high throughput screening, we undertook a
candidate gene-set analysis based upon significantly enriched fsets or rare
mutations specifically in colon related disorders. Seeking novel insights into the
disorder, we used pathway analysis based upon Gene Ontology (GO) derived from
PANTHER ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) (http://pantherdb.org/tools), EnrichR
(Chen et al., 2013) (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) annotation terms. Gene
Ontology based annotations included Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool
(BinGO) (Maere et al., 2005), a plug-in for ontology annotation in Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003) used for ontological analysis in the form of biological, cellular
and metabolic processes.

Identification of transcripts for comparative screening
From RNA-Seq, quality check was ensued after total RNA was isolated and cDNA
double strand synthesis on a pair of CPC type-4 samples. The RNA-Seq was
performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 2x100bp paired end sequencing
chemistry which generated ca. 16 million reads. The pair of samples was run
through differential gene expression analysis using Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2012)

intergenic regions of the genes from WES samples were queried. The lncRNA NONHSAT002007 was identified based on the query coverage e-value < 0.01. The
sequences were carefully checked for bidirectional blast hits and the lncRNA was
visualized using an Ensembl genome browser for bona fidelity.
SNP Genotyping
For Sequenom genotyping, Multiplexed iPLEX Assay was designed using Assay
design suite by Agena Biosciences and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was performed using
Agena Biosciences MassArray Analyzer platform on 29 SNPs in 37 DNA samples (16
probands and 21 controls). This method consists of five steps: PCR amplification,

and mass window of analyte peak observation was set at 4500-9000 Da. Call
frequencies, expressed as percentages was calculated for each SNP. For Sequenom,
20 ng of DNA with reference was used to determine 40 SNP calls; however 29 SNPs
were validated due to the general failure of SNP calls in, viz. rs483929, rs10277,
rs4935, rs8002, rs9260191, rs1051454, rs1141701, rs76046078, rs76325618, and
rs796106620 which, therefore, were excluded from our analysis.
