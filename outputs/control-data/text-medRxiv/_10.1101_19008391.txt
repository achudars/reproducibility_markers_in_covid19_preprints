Abstract

31

Background

32

Low-value diagnostic testing adds billions of dollars to the cost of health care in the US

33

annually. Addressing patient preference for these tests is one possible strategy to limit overuse.

34

In previous work, we showed that patient preference for testing can be influenced by test benefit,

35

risk, and financial measures. Our objective was to examine the effect of these variables in

36

another clinical scenario involving chest pain.

37

38

Methods

39

In this cross-sectional survey of patients at the University of Michigan Emergency Department

40

(ED), participants were given a hypothetical scenario involving an ED visit for chest pain, along

41

with information regarding potential benefit (detecting a life-threatening condition; 0.1 or 1%)

42

and risk (developing cancer; 0.1 or 1%) of CTCA, as well as an incentive of $0 or $100 to forego

43

testing. Values for risk, benefit, and financial incentive varied across participants. Our primary

44

outcome was patient preference to undergo testing. We also obtained demographic and numeracy

45

information. Then, we used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios, adjusting for multiple

46

potential confounders. Our sample size was designed to find at least 300 events (test acceptance)

47

to allow for up to 30 covariates in fully adjusted models. We had 85-90% power to detect a 10%

48

absolute difference in testing rate across groups, assuming a 95% significance level.

913 patients were surveyed. A $100 financial incentive (adjusted OR [AOR] 0.57; 95%

significantly decreased test acceptance in fully adjusted models, whereas increased test benefit

54

significantly increased test acceptance (AOR 2.45; 95% CI 1.79-3.36).

55

56

Conclusions

57

Offering a financial incentive deterred patients from accepting testing despite varying levels of

58

risk and benefit. In the context of previous work, we provide preliminary evidence supporting

59

that financial interventions may impact patient preference more than test risk and benefit.

Introduction

62

Overuse of diagnostic testing in low-risk patients contributes substantially to the rising cost of

63

health care. One study estimated that the total annual financial burden of defensive medicine in

64

the United States exceeded $46 billion in 2008 alone, and it is likely that this figure has

65

continued to rise in proportion with the overall cost of health care.1 Furthermore, patients who

66

undergo unnecessary diagnostic tests are still subject to the risks of testing when potential benefit

67

is limited. Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA) is a diagnostic test has

68

clinical utility in determining the need for more invasive procedures in patients with chest pain

69

and has a high negative predictive value for ruling out anginal chest pain.2 While it is useful for

70

certain patients, CTCA also involves radiation exposure that has been associated with an

71

increased cancer risk.3

72

73

Addressing overuse of low-value testing can be difficult, in part because the term “low-value” is

74

often subjectively defined. Although there are clinical decision tools available for providers to

75

risk stratify patients, the potential risk and benefit of testing varies considerably among patients.4

76

Initiating discussions with patients regarding the benefits and risks of low-value testing to elicit

77

patient preference has emerged as a potential solution to decrease the use of unnecessary

78

diagnostic testing in the emergency department. There is also evidence to support that patients

79

may be responsive to financial information while making health care decisions, although this

80

continues to be debated and has yet been be fully described.5-9

Patient preferences for low-value CTCA
82

Our previous work on this topic demonstrated that increased financial cost to patients

83

significantly decreased their desire for low-value diagnostic testing with CTCA and Computed

84

Tomography (CT) head scans in hypothetical scenarios involving chest pain and minor traumatic

85

brain injury (TBI), respectively.7, 9 A subsequent study focused solely on patient preferences for

86

CT head in minor TBI showed that a financial incentive for patients to forego low-value

87

diagnostic testing also significantly reduced patient preference for this test.6 While the influence

88

of test benefit and risk on patient decision-making was of mixed statistical significance in our

89

original work, these variables both achieved statistical significance in our CT head/minor TBI

90

study.6, 9

91

92

In this study, we investigated the effect of a direct financial incentive to forego low-value

93

diagnostic testing on patient preference to pursue diagnostic CTCA in a hypothetical scenario

94

involving low-risk chest pain in the context of varying levels of associated test benefit and risk.

95

Our aim in this study was to obtain further data to better characterize the effect of a financial

96

incentive – as well as varying levels of test benefit and risk – on patient preference across

97

another clinical scenario involving a different diagnostic test. We hypothesized that our results

98

would be comparable to our follow-up study involving minor TBI in that a financial incentive,

99

increased test risk, and decreased test benefit would all significantly deter patients from

100

accepting testing with low-value CTCA.

Patient preferences for low-value CTCA
104

This study is a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of adult patients from the

105

University of Michigan Emergency Department (ED) designed to examine the potential effect of

106

financial incentive, test benefit, and test risk on patient preference for low-value diagnostic

107

testing with CTCA in the setting of chest pain. The current study reports a different outcome

108

based on previously reported methodology.6

109

110

Study Design

111

Study participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario in which they presented to the ED

112

with low-risk chest pain, for which further testing with CTCA would not be clinically indicated.

113

All patients were assigned values for potential test benefit (percent chance that a CTCA would

114

detect a life-threatening acute process; either 0.1 or 1%) that would classify them as having a

115

HEART score in the low risk category.10

116

117

The full study scenario is available in Appendix A. Consent was obtained, and the scenario script

118

was read aloud to all participants to minimize any issues they might have with reading, seeing, or

119

understanding the scenario. Participants then were assigned a value for test benefit (detecting a

120

life-threatening medical condition; either 0.1% or 1%), test risk (the chance of developing cancer

121

due to radiation within 10 years; either 0.1% or 1%), and financial incentive (a cash payment of

122

$0 or $100 from an insurance company to forego CTCA) prior to being asked for their

123

preference for or against testing. Values for test risk and benefit were represented as percentages,

124

ratios, and visual depictions (Appendix A) to facilitate participants’ understanding.11, 12 As in

125

previous work, these values for benefit, risk, and financial incentive were chosen because they

126

were thought to encompass the most interesting zone of variation in patient preference in a

Setting and Population

131

Our study used a convenience sample of 913 adult patients in the University of Michigan ED

132

who were not presenting with chest pain, recent head trauma, or altered mental status. No

133

patients in resuscitation bays or with contact precautions were approached. Participation was

134

voluntary, and participants were not offered financial compensation for participating.

Primary Outcomes and Variables

141

Our primary outcome was the percentage of patients accepting diagnostic testing with CTCA

142

given the three major predictive variables: test benefit, test risk, and financial incentive. This

143

combination of variables resulted in eight possible subgroups. We obtained de-identified

144

demographic information and relevant past medical history to assess for potential confounders,

145

which were specified in advance. Confounders included age, gender, marital status, educational

146

status, race, ethnicity, income, prior medical training or employment, self-reported overall

147

health, and past medical history of cancer, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, myocardial

148

infarction, or head trauma requiring a hospital visit. Numeracy was evaluated by a previously

validated assessment, and participants were classified as having low, medium, or high numeracy

150

accordingly.14

151

152

Data Collection

153

We used Qualtrics for survey administration and data collection, and we used SPSS (Armonk,

154

NY Version 25) for data analysis. All participant responses in which the primary outcome was

155

obtained were incorporated into the analysis. We compared the unadjusted proportion of

156

participants who chose to receive a CTCA for each combination of values for test benefit, test

157

risk, and financial incentive.

158

159

Sample Size

160

We followed methodology that was previously reported in our 2018 and 2019 work analyzing

161

the effect of an additional copayment or financial incentive for a diagnostic test, respectively.6, 9

162

Our sample size of 913 conferred approximately 85-90% power to detect a 10% absolute change

163

in the proportion of subjects agreeing to testing from a baseline test acceptance rate of 50% at a

164

95% level of significance.

165

166

Data Analysis

167

We performed a series of nested multivariable logistic regression models to obtain the odds that

168

participants would agree to undergo a CTCA, given the variable combinations as noted above.

169

We adjusted for four sets of variables in the models, and all variables were specified in advance.

170

Variables were ordered so that those predicted to be more influential would be included in earlier

171

models. The fully adjusted model was limited to at most 30 variables in order to not exceed 10

outcome events per predictor. Model 1 adjusted for the benefit, risk, and financial incentive

173

associated with testing. Model 2 additionally adjusted for income, education level, and

174

numeracy. Model 3 additionally adjusted for age, gender, race, ethnicity, and previous healthcare

175

training/employment. Finally, Model 4 additionally adjusted for self-reported overall health and

176

a medical history of cancer, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, or

177

head trauma requiring a hospital visit. Model fit was evaluated by the Hosmer and Lemeshow

178

Goodness of Fit Statistic with a p value of >0.05 indicating adequate fit.

The deidentified dataset and model output (including all parameter estimates for the fully

180

adjusted models, and goodness of fit statistics) is posted in the University of Michigan

181

Institutional Data Repository (https://doi.org/10.7302/pnmm-4v40).

182

183

Results

184

913 patients met inclusion criteria and completed the primary outcome by submitting their

185

preference regarding undergoing diagnostic testing with CTCA. These 913 participants’ results

186

were incorporated into the analysis. The median participant age was 46 years (interquartile range

187

30-60) with an absolute range of 18-92 years. Further demographic and medical characteristics

188

are displayed in Table 1.

189

190

Patients agreed to undergo CTCA in 62.8% of scenarios (573 out of 913). Unadjusted patient

191

preferences in each of the eight subgroups, which account for all possible combinations of the

192

three predictor variables, are shown in Table 2. In the unadjusted models, we found that

193

increased test risk and a financial incentive to forego testing resulted in a statistically significant

194

decrease in odds of test acceptance, whereas increased test benefit increased patient preference

for testing (Table 3). Each of the adjusted models also demonstrated this relationship (Table 4),

196

suggesting that none of the variables incorporated into the adjusted models were confounders

197

influencing the observed effect of the major predictive variables on test acceptance.

198

199

The fully adjusted models (Table 4) indicated that the odds of patients accepting a CTCA was

200

significantly lower when patients were offered a $100 financial incentive to forego testing, as

201

compared to when no incentive was offered (adjusted OR [AOR] 0.57; 95% Confidence Interval

202

[CI] 0.42-0.78). Increasing test benefit from 0.1% to 1% resulted in a significant increase in odds

203

of test acceptance (AOR 2.45; 95% CI 1.79-3.36), and increasing test risk from 0.1% to 1% was

204

associated with a significant decrease in odds of test acceptance (AOR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44-0.84).

205

206

Discussion

207

This study examined the effect of test benefit, test risk, and a financial incentive on patient

208

preference for pursuing low-value CTCA for chest pain in the ED. We found that decreased test

209

benefit, increased test risk, and offering a financial incentive decreased patient preference for

210

testing in a statistically significant manner. These findings supplement our prior work by

211

providing further evidence that a financial intervention targeted at reducing patient preference for

212

low-value testing may be effective in influencing patients’ decision-making. A financial

213

incentive thereby may help to decrease costs attributable to unnecessary diagnostic testing in the

214

ED. Additionally, our data provides further evidence to suggest that discussing benefits and risks

215

of diagnostic testing with patients can impact their preferences regarding low-value tests, even

216

when values for benefit and risk are low.

Patient preferences for low-value CTCA
218

These results are particularly interesting in the context of our prior study in 2018, which

219

evaluated the impact of benefit, risk, and out-of-pocket cost on patient preference for low-value

220

CTCA in a similar hypothetical low-risk chest pain scenario.9 In the current study, there was a

221

19.2% drop in test acceptance (72.3% to 53.1%) with decreased test benefit, a 9.1% drop (67.3%

222

to 58.2%) with increased risk, and a 10.1% drop (67.8% to 57.7%) with a financial incentive. In

223

the 2018 work, we observed a similar trend in the data – there was a 9.4% drop (74.3% to

224

65.0%) in test acceptance with decreased benefit, a 1.5% drop (70.4% to 68.9%) with increased

225

risk, and a 22% drop (80.8% to 58.7%) with increased cost to the patient, although only the

226

effects of benefit and cost reached statistical significance. Additionally, the results of our current

227

study were congruent with our more recent study that analyzed the effect of test benefit, test risk,

228

and financial incentive on patient preference for low-value diagnostic testing with CT head in a

229

minor TBI scenario.6 This supports that the relationship between these variables may be

230

observed across multiple clinical situations.

231

232

Overall, the consistent effect of a financial intervention across all three studies provides

233

preliminary evidence to suggest that a financial strategy may be effective in modulating patients’

234

preferences regarding low-value diagnostic testing in the ED. Furthermore, while varying test

235

risk and benefit did influence patients’ odds of test acceptance, these variables were not

236

statistically significant in all three studies. This suggests that a financial approach may be more

237

effective in influencing patient preferences than discussing the risks and benefits of testing alone.

238

Further study will be required to better describe the relationship between these variables and

239

patient preferences, as well as to comment on the generalizability of our findings in clinical

240

scenarios beyond low-risk chest pain and minor TBI.

242

Limitations

243

There are several limitations that should be considered when interpreting our results. First, we

244

surveyed ED patients using a hypothetical clinical scenario that was intentionally different from

245

their presenting chief complaint. Patients experiencing chest pain in the ED may be influenced

246

differently by our predictor variables. Additionally, the hypothetical scenario in our study

247

provided numeric representations of benefit and risk, whereas an individual patient’s actual

248

benefit and risk for a particular test may not be easily quantifiable in this way. True risk of

249

CTCA may be lower than the percentages assigned in these scenarios, but 0.1% and 1% were

250

selected to maintain symmetry with values for potential benefit. Our study also cannot account

251

for the varying levels of medical knowledge or past exposure to health care that may have

252

affected patients’ decision-making, even though participants were instructed to only consider the

253

numeric values for benefit and risk. Furthermore, as with prior studies, these hypothetical

254

scenarios required patients to consider the benefit of detecting an acute medical condition against

255

the risk of an adverse outcome far in the future – different time of onset for benefit and risk may

256

have also influenced patients’ decisions. Finally, while we have now shown that a financial

257

incentive is associated with a statistically significant decrease in test acceptance in two distinct

258

clinical scenarios, this may not be generalizable outside the context of a low-risk, low-value test.

259

Patients may also make decisions differently if a test is designed to detect a medical condition

260

that is not life-threatening.

Patient preferences for low-value CTCA
263

This cross-sectional survey of patients in the ED suggests that a financial incentive may be

264

effective in dissuading patients from accepting low-value testing with CTCA in the context of

265

low-risk chest pain. Given that this effect was also observed in a separate clinical scenario in our

266

prior study with similar methodology, it is possible that offering a financial incentive may be an

267

effective deterrent against patient preference for low-value testing across several distinct clinical

268

scenarios. Lower test benefit and higher test risk also significantly decreased patient preference

269

for testing in this study; however, these variables have not consistently emerged as statistically

270

significant factors in our previous work, whereas financial interventions have been statistically

271

significant throughout. Taken together, the findings in these studies suggest that a financial

272

approach may be more effective in influencing patient preference for low-value diagnostic

273

testing than discussion of test benefit and risk alone. Further study is needed to better

274

characterize the effect of each of these factors on patient preferences in additional clinical

275

scenarios and in a non-hypothetical setting.

Model 1 adjusts for benefit, risk, and incentive associated with testing. Model 2 additionally
adjusts for income, education level, and numeracy. Model 3 additionally adjusts for age, gender, race, ethnicity, and
previous healthcare training or employment. Model 4 additionally adjusts for self-reported overall health and a
medical history of cancer, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and head trauma
requiring hospital visit. Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness of Fit p-value ranged from 0.9 to 0.3, indicating that
model fit was adequate. AOR = adjusted odds ratio; CI = confidence interval.
