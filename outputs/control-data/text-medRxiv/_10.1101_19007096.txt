Abstract
BACKGROUND: In late 2016, US diplomats stationed in Havana began presenting with a variety
of neurological manifestations that proved difficult to diagnose. Though previous studies suggested a
likely association with brain injury, the mechanism of injury, brain regions involved, and etiology
remained unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a multimodal study examining 26 Canadian diplomats and their family
members, the majority of whom presented with symptoms similar to their American counterparts
while residing in Havana. Assessments included a medical history, self-reported symptom
questionnaires, cognitive assessments, blood tests, and brain imaging assessments (magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)). Individuals showing signs of brain
injury underwent further neurological, visual, and audio-vestibular assessments. Eight participants
were tested both before and after living in Havana.
RESULTS: Our assessment documents multiple functional and structural impairments, including
significant spatial memory impairment, abnormal brain-stem evoked potentials, degradation of fibre
tracts in the fornix and posterior corpus callosum, blood-brain barrier injury to the right basal
forebrain and anterior insula, and abnormal paroxysmal slowing events of cortical activity.
Subsequent mass-spectrometry and blood analyses documented reduced serum cholinesterase
activity and the presence of organophosphates (Temephos) and pyrethroid metabolites (3phenoxybenzoic acid or 3-BPA).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm brain injury, specify the regions involved, and raise the
hypothesis of overexposure to cholinesterase inhibitors as a plausible etiology. If correct, our
hypothesis bears public health ramifications (see Discussion) and suggests a course of action for
reducing exposure in the future.

Introduction
In autumn 2016, US diplomats in Havana began reporting unusual sensory and auditory stimuli
accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tinnitus, and various cognitive manifestations. Initial testing
revealed abnormalities in cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential metrics and were
interpreted as a peripheral vestibular pathology affecting the otolithic organs.1
When 24 of the original subjects were retested approximately 200 days after the suspected exposure,
clinical findings included cognitive, vestibular, and oculomotor abnormalities and suggested “a
sustained injury to widespread brain networks.”2
To further understand the nature of injury and brain regions involved, we conducted multimodal
clinical and quantitative imaging assessments for brain injury among 26 Canadian diplomats and
their families stationed in Havana, the majority of whom presented with symptoms similar to their
American counterparts in the months following autumn 2016.

Methods
This was a multimodal, longitudinal, and quantitative study to examine behavioural and
physiological indices of acquired brain injury. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board
of the Nova Scotia Health Authority. All participants provided written informed consent. Clinical
tests were performed according to guidelines (see Appendix for more information).
EXPOSED & NON-EXPOSED SUBJECTS: Between August 10, 2018, and February 20, 2019,
we tested 26 Canadian adult subjects referred by Global Affairs Canada for evaluation. Of this
group, 23 were considered “exposed” while 12 were considered “non-exposed,” with double testing
(pre- and post-exposure) accounting for overlap between the two groups (see below).

RECENTLY EXPOSED & REMOTELY EXPOSED: To better understand the progression of
injury over time, data sets were separated according to when we were able to test our subjects.
Within the exposed group, we were able to test 11 individuals within one month of their return from
Havana, a group we classified as “recently exposed,” and 12 individuals 1-19 months after returning
(median 14 months), a group we classified as “remotely exposed,” with double testing between these
two subgroups accounting for overlap in figures (see below).
REPEATED TESTING: Some subjects were tested twice. In particular, 8 participants were tested
both prior to and immediately upon returning from Havana (forming part of both non-exposed and
recent test groups), while 1 recently exposed subject was tested again as a remote subject. (See
Appendix Figure 3 for a visual breakdown.)
DEFINITION OF EXPOSURE: “Exposure” here refers strictly to exposure to Havana. The
duration of stay in Havana ranged from five to eight months (mean 6.5 months) for recently exposed
subjects, and from 1-24 months (mean 21.95 months) for remotely exposed subjects.
For all 26 subjects, we conducted an initial screening across five dimensions: medical history and
anthropometric measures, self-reported symptom questionnaires, computerized cognitive
assessments, blood tests, and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
magnetoencephalography (MEG)). Individuals suspected to have incurred brain injuries (based
primarily on self-reported symptom questionnaires) underwent further neurological, visual, auditory,
and vestibular assessments, as needed.

Initial Screening
Medical history and anthropometric measures included travel history, height, weight (to calculate
BMI), blood pressure, and heart rate.

Self-rated questionnaires included the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire
(RPQ),3,4 Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS),5 Headache Impact Test (HIT-6),6 Beck
Depression (BDI-II) and Anxiety Inventories,7,8 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist – Civilian
(PCL-5),9 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).10
Cognitive functioning was assessed across the domains of executive functioning, processing speed,
attention, working memory, and episodic memory using CANTAB (www.cantab.com). In
addition to our core non-exposed group of 12 subjects, cognitive results for our exposed group were
compared to 35 healthy age- and sex-matched diplomats not posted in Havana.
Blood testing assessed kidney and liver functions, fasting glucose and insulin levels, lipid panel,
complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone, and C-reactive protein.
MRI was conducted using a 3-T GE MR750 MRI scanner and included T1, T2, diffusion-weighted,
and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.
For Diffusion MRI analysis, we used Mrtrix3 software11 and Fixel-Based Analysis.12 A total of 66
scans were analyzed: 6 from recently exposed subjects, 12 from remotely exposed subjects, 8 from
non-exposed subjects, and 40 from healthy age- and sex-matched participants.
Voxel-based blood-brain barrier (BBB) imaging analysis was performed as reported earlier.13 The
normalized contrast agent accumulation rates were defined as the unit-of-measure for BBB
permeability. To calculate overall BBB leakage, the number of voxels with a contrast accumulation
rate higher than the 95th percentile of all values in a cohort of control subjects (considered to have a
leaky BBB) was divided by total brain volume.13 Of the 126 anatomical regions assessed, a brain
region was determined leaky when the percent of volume with accumulation rates exceeded three
standard deviations of controls. A total of 43 scans were analyzed, including 8 from recently exposed

subjects (both before and after exposure), 12 from remotely exposed subjects, and 10 from healthy
age- and sex-matched controls.
Resting state MEG data were collected using an Elekta Neuromag whole head 306-channel MEG
system.14 We used fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis for studying alterations in brain activity.
Periods of paroxysmal slow wave events (PSWEs) were defined as time periods of brain activity in
which the median power frequency was less than 6 Hz for more than 5 seconds. Data was analyzed
from 11 recently exposed subjects, 15 remotely exposed subjects, and 61 healthy age- and sexmatched controls (21 of whom were recorded in the same MEG, while an additional 40 recordings
were obtained from the CamCAN repository (http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/datasets/camcan/).
See Table 1 for a breakdown of clinical and research methods used during Initial Screening. For
more details, see Appendix.

Need-Based Assessments
Individuals who reported symptoms suggesting brain injury underwent further neurological, visual
and audio-vestibular assessments.
The neurological assessment included a clinical examination, Sport Concussion Assessment Tool
(SCAT5), and the King-Devick Test.
The visual assessment included evaluation for afferent and efferent visual system defects and a
detailed assessment of ocular alignment in all positions of gaze as well as horizontal saccadic
velocities and fixation stability.
The audio-vestibular assessment included pure tone testing, otoacoustic emissions and immittance
testing, tympanometry and acoustic reflex threshold testing, auditory evoked potential testing, a
Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT), Videonystamography (VNG), a caloric test, and cervical and
ocular vestibular myogenic potential testing.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical data analysis was performed using MATLAB and Prism, while Mann-Whitney U and χ2
were used for comparisons, as appropriate. For fibre tractography, statistical analysis was conducted
using Connectivity-based Fixel Enhancement (CFE), non-parametric permutation testing using 5000
permutations, and Family-Wise error correction at a P-value of 0.05. Age was included in the
analysis as a nuisance covariate. For comparing damage levels between the recently exposed,
remotely exposed, and non-exposed groups, a mask was generated for significant fixels, while
extracted fibre density values were compared using t-tests. Statistical comparison of BBB leakage in
subjects scanned prior to and shortly after exposure were performed using a paired two-tailed
Wilcoxon signed rank test. Differences between recently and remotely exposed subjects were
assessed using a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. P-values below 0.05 were considered
significant.

to sound, feeling off balance), and generally reduced well-being (sleep disturbances, fatigue,
headaches, irritability) (Table 2).
Anthropometric measures: Results were similar to what is usually obtained in the Canadian
population, with no significant differences between the groups (Appendix Table 2).
Blood Tests: Results were similar to what is usually obtained in the Canadian population, with no
significant differences between the groups (Appendix Table 3).
Self-Reported Symptom Questionnaires: Of the eight questionnaires, three were scored positively by
the majority of exposed individuals: RPQ (for post-concussive syndrome), HIT-6 (for headache
severity), and MIDAS (for migraine) (Table 3).
Cognitive Assessments: We recorded significantly lower performance in spatial working memory
within both recently and remotely exposed individuals compared to age-matched controls
(P=0.0003). A milder reduction in performance was also found in decision-making quality (Table 4).

Need-Based Assessments
Neurological Assessment: Results were similar to what is usually obtained in the Canadian
population, with no significant differences between the groups.
Visual Assessment: Results were similar to what is usually obtained in the Canadian population, with
no significant differences between the groups (Appendix Table 4).
Audio-Vestibular Assessment: Hearing loss was found in 3 of the 20 exposed subjects tested (15%)
but was asymptomatic, and in 2 of the 3, could be attributed to a history of sound exposure prior to
exposure. Auditory brain-stem evoked potentials, however, showed long latencies (both absolute and
interpeak) in the majority of exposed individuals, with no significant difference between the two
exposed groups. Acoustic reflex was also found to be positive in 80% of individuals in both exposed
groups (Appendix Table 5). The most consistent finding in the vestibular assessment was the
presence of low-threshold, high-amplitude cervical and/or ocular vestibular evoked myogenic

potentials. This was found in 33-66% of exposed individuals, with no difference between the
exposed groups (Appendix Table 6). Both auditory and vestibular assessments were consistent with
brain-stem dysfunction.

Brain Imaging (MRI & MEG)
Clinical MRI: In 4 of the 26 scanned subjects, non-specific white matter hyperintensities in T2 and
FLAIR sequences were observed; in one subject, a small capillary telangiectasia in the pons was
observed; in another, Chiari I malformation was observed. Extracranial findings in four individuals
included mucosal inflammatory changes of the paranasal sinuses. All such findings were considered
incidental and similar to what is often seen in healthy individuals, without clinical significance.
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (MRI): A significant difference in white matter integrity between the nonexposed and exposed groups was indicated (P<0.05). Decreased fibre density was observed in the
exposed group, predominantly along the right crus of the fornix, past the hippocampal commissure,
and projecting into the hippocampus, as well as in the splenium of the corpus callosum (Figure 1).
Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI: Analysis of 8 subjects tested both before and after living in
Havana revealed an increase in the brain volume and number of regions with a leaky blood-brain
barrier (BBB). Statistical comparison of the extent of BBB dysfunction in 126 anatomical regions
revealed 6 leaky brain regions in post-exposure compared to pre-exposure scans (P<0.05). A leaky
BBB was mainly found in the right hemisphere and included the right basal forebrain, anterior
insula, posterior orbital, superior frontal, and superior occipital gyri (Figure 2).
Brain regions with a high contrast agent rate of accumulation (i.e., a leaky BBB) were similar in both
exposed groups, although to a slightly lesser extent in the remotely exposed group. Similar brain
regions, specifically the right basal forebrain, anterior insula, and superior frontal gyrus, were found
to be leakier in both exposed groups compared to non-exposed controls (Figure 3).

Magnetoencephalography (MEG): Exposed individuals showed an increase in power in the delta
frequency range with decreased alpha. These changes were due to a transient, intermittent slowing of
brain activity, termed “paroxysmal slow-wave events” (PSWEs). PSWEs were rarely detected in
healthy controls, including test subjects prior to exposure. By contrast, PSWEs were significantly
more common in both exposed groups and were diffusely distributed in both hemispheres, more
prominently on the right (Figure 4).

Key Finding & Emergent Hypothesis: Exposure to Cholinesterase Inhibitors
Our brain imaging findings—in particular the consistent involvement of the basal forebrain, a key
cholinergic nucleus—raised the hypothesis that one or more environmental neurotoxins targeting the
brain’s cholinergic system may underlie the observed injury.
To support our hypothesis, serum samples tested for acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase activity
showed reduced enzyme activity in individuals recently returned from Havana compared to remotely
exposed and control groups (Figure 5).
Mass-spectrometry furthermore confirmed the presence of cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides,
including Temephos, an organophosphorus used in Cuba against mosquito larvae,15 and 3phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common pyrethroid (insecticidal) metabolite. Temephos was
detected in six of ten remotely exposed individuals, compared to one recently exposed individual and
none of the controls (P<0.001). 3-PBA was found in the majority (62%) of exposed individuals, with
no significant difference between the two groups (Appendix Table 7).

Discussion
Using a multimodal, quantitative, and control-tested approach, our results confirm brain injury,
specify the regions involved, and suggest a likely etiology underlying the Havana Syndrome in the

form of environmental exposure to neurotoxins affecting the brain’s cholinergic system. We more
narrowly suggest organophosphorus insecticides as a likely source.
Though other sources of neurotoxins are possible, our insecticidal hypothesis gains contextual
support given Cuba’s well-documented efforts to aggressively mitigate the spread of the Zika virus
by means of mass indoor and outdoor fumigations in 2016 and thereafter.16,17 Canadian Embassy
records furthermore confirmed a significant increase in the frequency of fumigations around and
within staff houses beginning January 2017, concurrent with reported symptoms (Figure 5C).
Whether in its broad or narrow form (cholinesterase-inhibiting neurotoxins in general or
organophosphorus insecticides in particular), our hypothesis provides a plausible alternative to the
theory of “unknown energy exposures”1 that have dominated media reports, and as such carries
potential public health and clinical ramifications.18,19

Public Health
If our narrow hypothesis of insecticide-induced neurotoxicity is correct, our findings suggest a
course of action that affects not only the physical health of diplomats and their family members that
are or will be stationed in Havana, but the health of the local Cuban population (where heavy
fumigation continues) and of all other populations where such insecticides are heavily used.
Next steps may include collaborating with Cuban scientists (and elsewhere) to test for neural injury
among the local population; testing American diplomats previously stationed in Havana for the
presence of Temephos and/or other metabolites in the blood; monitoring exposure levels and serum
activity; urging the Cuban government to limit the use of organophosphorus insecticides or to use
non-organophosphorus insecticides of equivalent efficacy to protect humans from neurotoxic damage
while continuing to control the spread of Zika; and lobbying for the ban of organophosphorus
insecticides worldwide, with recommendations for alternative forms of pest control. Further research

is also required to better understand genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying individual
differences in sensitivity to organophosphorus insecticides.20,21

Clinical and Diagnostic Methods
We demonstrate the effectiveness of a multimodal approach for diagnosing atypical brain injuries
and suggest new diagnostic modalities to quantitatively assess changes in brain structure and
function.
Though such diagnostics are primarily intended for research, we nevertheless propose that clinical
researcher-practitioners consider these novel techniques valuable diagnostic biomarkers when
presented not only with such difficult-to-diagnose conditions as the Havana Syndrome, but also in
more common neurological illnesses, including traumatic and degenerative brain disorders.13,22
Previous studies of the Havana Syndrome demonstrated the difficulty of diagnosing concussions and
other presentations of brain injury using available clinical tools, while the use of research tools and
quantitative analysis in the present study (including fibre tracking, BBB imaging, and MEG) allowed
the identification of specific brain networks and patterns of injury in our cohort. Though these are
merely research tools, we demonstrate their potential in aiding the clinical diagnosis of brain
disorders.

Biology of Disease
While acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors causes a typical clinical presentation that is usually
easy to recognize (constriction of pupils, salivation, loss of bowel and bladder control, seizures, and
reduced consciousness), long-term or repeated exposure to low levels of cholinesterase inhibitors are
more difficult to diagnose and may not show any acute symptoms.
Though the neurotoxic effects of low-dose exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors have been suggested
in other contexts, our study specifies how the brain is affected and suggests how injury to specific
12

cholinergic centres can underlie a profound symptomatology, including changes in brain stem
functions, white matter fibre integrity, and a corresponding reduction in spatial memory (for a full
breakdown, see Appendix).
Epidemiologically, our study broadens the scope of the problem of exposure to cholinesterase
inhibitors beyond agricultural pesticide use.

Alternative Hypotheses
Despite prevailing theories of acoustic attacks in the media, the highly focused and consistent pattern
of injury among exposed individuals is difficult to explain if resulting from energy exposures. There
were furthermore no acute incidents in most individuals; symptoms developed gradually over the
course of their stay in Havana.
Though insecticides are a likely source of organophosphates in the present cases, others cannot be
definitively ruled out. Organophosphorus warfare agents are both common and available, and
historically, several nerve agents of the G- (tabun (GA), sarin (GB), chlorosarin (GC) and soman
(GD)) and V-series (VE, VR, VS and VX) have been deployed not only in warfare but also in acts of
terrorism23 and high-profile assassinations.24 While in these previously reported incidents high-dose
exposure led to acute poisoning, low-dose exposure may not be associated with typical acute
symptoms.25 The brain changes we found are also consistent with the reduced volume of the right
insular and temporal cortices reported in victims of the 1995 sarin attack in Tokyo.26
Though most subjects in our study did not report an acute event of pressure or sound in contrast to
previous reports of American diplomats residing in Cuba,1,2 symptoms were similar to those reported
by them,2 including headaches and difficulties in concentration, balance, vision, and sleep. The
shared symptoms, location, period, and relative duration of time all point to a shared etiology.

Further Evidential Support

Acute poisoning with organophosphates has previously been shown to result in a robust opening of
the blood-brain barrier,27 while injury to the basal forebrain has previously been shown (in animal
studies) following acute or chronic exposure to organophosphates.28 Slowing of brain activity,
although not a specific finding, has also been previously reported to follow exposure to
organophosphates.29
The most direct evidence of the effects of low-dose exposure to organophosphates was published by
Bowers and colleagues (1964),25 who analyzed the clinical signs presented by 96 young male
volunteers following percutaneous exposure to a low dose of an organophosphate compound (likely
VX). No signs of acute toxicity were presented, but a “state of altered awareness” characterized by
difficulty sustaining attention and the slowing of intellectual and motor processes, in addition to
feelings of agitation, anxiety, and confusion, was reported.25 Tinnitus, vestibular, cognitive,
psychomotor dysfunction, attention deficits, and memory impairment have all been reported
following low-dose cholinesterase inhibitor exposure in humans.30,31
For further details regarding brain injury by cholinesterase inhibitors, see Appendix.

Recovery
Blood-brain barrier leakage and abnormal MEG activity were less pronounced in remotely exposed
individuals compared to the recently exposed group; this suggests that injury may be at least partially
reversible, and that recovery may be expected once exposure is halted. On the other hand, DTI
analysis for fibre integrity suggested a slightly more pronounced reduction in remotely exposed
individuals and may indicate progressive axonal injury. Follow-up is required to better understand
the natural course of brain injury in affected individuals.

Conclusion
We report clinical, imaging, biochemical, and toxicological evidence consistent with the hypothesis
of overexposure to cholinesterase inhibitors as the cause of brain injury in our cohort. While other
causes cannot be ruled out, our findings point to an environmental (and possibly insecticidal) risk
with immediate implications for prevention, screening, and follow-up of individuals in the context of
exposure to such neurotoxins.
This is the first brain imaging study documenting blood-brain barrier pathology in patients tested
both before and after acquired brain injury.

splenium of the corpus callosum.
D. Post-hoc analysis indicated decreased fibre density in the remotely exposed group
compared to the pre-exposed group (N=8, P=0.026) and all non-exposed control groups
(N=40, P<0.001). Recently exposed participants showed a trend for reduced fibre density
compared to pre-exposed controls (P=0.08), and significant reduced fibre density when
compared to non-exposed controls (P=0.032).

hypothesis that BBB integrity would be impaired in the parahippocampus gyrus due to its well-recognized role
in spatial memory.32 Indeed, the right parahippocampal cortex (but not the left) displayed a leaky BBB.
Regions: Basal forebrain (B Foreb), Anterior Cingulate (Ant Ching), Superior Orbital (Sup Orn), Superior
Frontal (Sup Fron), Superior occipital (Sup Occip) and parahippocampal (Parahipp) gyri.

Appendix
(Return to Top)
The Cholinergic System and Brain Regions Involved
Nucleus Basalis and Basal Forebrain: The nucleus basalis within the basal forebrain includes
cholinergic neurons with widespread connections to other parts of the brain, and which are thought to
be involved in the modulation of neuronal activity during sleep-wake cycle and attention. Injury to
basal forebrain cholinergic neurons may thus explain related symptoms reported in our cohort as well
as periods of slowing in brain activity found in MEG (see Figure 5 in main article above). The
diffuse pattern of slowing observed, while predominantly in the right hemisphere, supports a diffuse
change in brain function as can be induced directly by toxins or indirectly by affecting the basal
forebrain’s cholinergic fibres, in contrast to focal injury more characteristic of a traumatic event.

Brainstem Nuclei: In addition to the basal forebrain, brainstem nuclei are the other source of brain
cholinergic projections. Evidence for brainstem injury was found on audio-vestibular tests (including
positive acoustic reflex and vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, as well as delayed latency in
brainstem evoked potentials in the majority of exposed individuals). These results are consistent with
previous reports on auditory dysfunction and delayed brain stem evoked potentials following chronic
exposure to agricultural organophosphates.33,34 The vestibular system, through cholinergic fibres,
also alters hippocampal rhythms and is involved in spatial memory, observed to be affected in our
cohort.35

Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus: The other principal cholinergic nucleus is the brainstem
pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN), which is involved in mechanisms of arousal and
behavioral state control and participates in control of locomotion and muscle tone. Malfunction of

the PPN has a role in gait impairment and balance,36 and is consistent with the abnormal processing
of auditory input found in the majority of exposed individuals (see Appendix Tables 7-8 below).

Cholinesterase Inhibitors and The Blood-Brain Barrier: We found microvascular damage (a
leaky BBB) in most exposed individuals, with a significant region-specificity when comparing
individuals tested both pre- and post- exposure and in all exposed compared to non-exposed controls.
While data on the effects of low-dose exposure is scarce, acute poisoning with organophosphates has
been shown to result in robust BBB opening.27,37 In addition, several studies have demonstrated that
organophosphorus pesticides have a direct effect on microvasculature and cause increased
permeability in in-vitro models of the BBB.37 Particularly interesting was the region-specificity
involved. Out of 126 brain regions tested, the right basal forebrain and anterior insula significantly
and consistently showed microvascular damage in both exposed groups compared to controls. The
basal forebrain is a key brain cholinergic nucleus that has a key role in arousal, attention, memory,
and the sleep-wake cycle. The right anterior insula is considered to be associated with sensory
processing and body awareness.38The basal forebrain sends input to the hippocampus and
parahippocampal gyrus via the fornix, which was found to show reduced fibre density in the exposed
group. Interestingly, the right parahippocampal gyrus has been shown to be critical in spatial
memory processes,32 which were impaired in our cohort (see Appendix Table 5 below). The reason
for the dominancy of the right brain in the observed injury is not known.

Visual Assessment
Subjects were evaluated for afferent and efferent visual system defects including infranuclear
pathways for cranial nerves 2,3,4 and 6. All testing was conducted within the Pediatric
Ophthalmology and Strabismus unit at the IWK Health Centre. Each evaluation included a detailed
history to determine the presence and nature of any reported visual symptom.
General visual assessment: The afferent visual system was evaluated by visual acuity testing (near
and distance), contrast sensitivity function, and a full evaluation of pupils. Refractive status was
assessed but formal cycloplegic refractions were not conducted. Un-dilated fundus photographs were
obtained and reviewed by an ophthalmologist. Additional tests were done in the presence of specific
signs or symptoms. This included visual electrophysiology, accommodative function, color vision,
exophthalmometry, intra-ocular pressure (I-Care device not requiring anesthetic) and reassessment of
visual function with appropriate lenses in place in situations of uncorrected/mis-corrected refractive
errors or presbyopia.
Orthoptic evaluation (emphasis on efferent visual system): This consisted of a detailed assessment
of ocular alignment in all positions of gaze using standardized clinical tests; gross assessment of
ocular movements with attention to the extent of excursions; and integrity of eye movement subsystems (smooth pursuit, saccades, and vergences). Special attention was directed to convergence
ability when nearby.
Orthoptic evaluation (emphasis on binocular vision): Testing involved the assessment of stereoacuity and fusional amplitudes (nearby and at a distance) using standardized clinical tests.
Eye movement recordings: The Eyelink 1000 eye tracking system was used to assess horizontal
saccadic velocities between antagonist extra-ocular muscles and fixation stability on at central near
fixation target.

Audio-Vestibular Assessment
Our audio-vestibular assessment was conducted according to clinical guidelines on 20 of our subjects
(10 recently exposed, 10 remotely exposed).
The assessment included pure tone testing (according to the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) standards and high-frequency (HF) testing (at 9 kHz, 10 kHz, 11.2 kHz, 12.5 kHz, 14 kHz,
16 kHz and 18 kHz).
Audiometry was performed with a Madsen Astera (GN Otometrics, Germany) audiometer with
Sennheiser HDA-200 supra-aural headphones. Otoacoustic emissions test and Immittance Testing.
Tympanometry and acoustic reflex thresholds were performed with a diagnostic impedance
meter Zodiac (Madsen, Natus). For evaluating acoustic reflex thresholds, ≥100 dB HL were
considered increased. An absent reflex was observed when there was no measurable change in
immittance (0.02mm) at 105 dB. Auditory evoked testing was conducted with click stimulus at
80 dB HL, monaural, 11.7 clicks per second, 2000 sweeps, alternating polarity (High pass filter =
100 Hz, low pass = 3000 Hz).
Our vestibular assessment included a Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT, Micromedical Spectrum 9.1
Visual Eyes System); Videonystamography (VNG): Oculomotor (gaze, saccades, tracking,
optokinetics), positional, positioning, and caloric testing (Micromedical Spectrum 9.1). Cervical
(sternocleidomastoid) and ocular vestibular myogenic potentials were obtained using a 500-Hz, 95dB nHL tone burst, with a 2-cycle rise time, 1-cycle plateau, and 2-cycle fall time (Biologic
Navigator Pro).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Analysis
Diffusion-weighted MRIs were acquired with an Oblique-Axial SS-EPI sequence with magnetic
gradients with b-values of 1000 s/mm2, 60 directions, and the following specifications: FOV 22cm,

77 axial slices, voxel size 2 x 2 x 2 mm3, TR = 8s, and an acceleration factor of 2. The image
acquisition sequence also included 7 b=0 interleaved acquisitions to facilitate motion correction. To
facilitate image distortion correction, an additional scan of 7 b=0 images having phase encode blip
polarity reversal was acquired. DCE-MRI was conducted according to published protocols (GE
Discovery MR750, 3T, FOV 24cm, slice thickness 6mm, 192x192 matrix, flip angle 15°, TR/TE
4.1/2.1ms) before and after intravenous injection with the magnetic contrast-agent gadoteridol
(0.1 mmol/kg, ProHance, Bracco Imaging Canada, Montreal, QC). DCE-MRI (N=40) was performed
on 10 recently exposed and 12 remotely exposed individuals and compared to 16 non-exposed
controls (including a previous cohort). Of the 7 individuals scanned twice, 6 were scanned both
immediately prior to leaving for Havana and a few (1-6 days) after returning, while 1 individual
(who was posted for 13 months in Havana) was scanned 2 days after returning to Canada as well as 2
months later.
Diffusion MRI Analysis
We used MRtrix3 software11 and Fixel-Based Analysis (FBA).12 Preprocessing of diffusion images
(N=65) included denoising, removal of Gibbs ringing artefacts, and correction of distortions induced
by susceptibility off-resonance fields, eddy currents, and head motion.41 In addition, we used bias
field correction and global intensity normalization across the normative healthy participants using
group-wise registration to a study-specific fractional anisotropy (FA) template. Constrained spherical
deconvolution was used to obtain single-fibre white matter response functions and averaged across
all participants. Obtained response function was used to compute Fibre Orientation Distribution
(FOD) images following the up-sampling of diffusion images to voxel size of 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.3 mm.3 A
study-specific and unbiased FOD template was generated using all normative healthy participants
(N=40).

Participants were incorporated to the cohort by correcting for the bias field and performing global
intensity normalization using the FA template generated. FOD images for all participants were then
registered to the created template. Registrations were used to warp subject masks to the template and
obtain an intersection template mask subsequently used for the segmentation of the FOD template
into a fixel template mask.
Segmentation involved thresholding the peak amplitude of positive FOD lobes at 0.3 to constrain the
fitting of fixels to white matter fibre populations and mapping obtained fixels to a fixel mask. Next,
subject FOD images were segmented into fixels and values for Fibre Density (FD) were computed
per fixel for each subject following spatial transformation of the FOD image to the template space.
Spatial and orientational matching between subject and template fixels involved reorientation of all
subject fixels using FOD registration warps and a correspondence process to assign each template
fixel to a matching subject fixel, across all subjects. Using the template fixels and the subject-totemplate Jacobian matrix warps, Fibre Cross-section (FC) was obtained for each fixel across subjects
and then normally distributed by performing a log transformation of the metric. A conjunction of the
two metrics, Fibre Density and Cross-section (FDC), was then computed by multiplying the two
metrics.
Whole-brain probabilistic tractography was performed on the FOD template using an FOD amplitude
cutoff of 0.1 to generate 20 million streamlines. The tractogram was then filtered using Sphericaldeconvolution Informed Filtering of Tractograms (SIFT) to 2 million streamlines to reduce biases
from the tractography algorithm. Group statistical comparisons were performed independently on
FD, FC, and FDC for every fixel using a General Linear Model to investigate microstructural
differences in white matter tracts between the unexposed cohort and the exposed cohort.

Analysis for BBB integrity was performed as published.13,42,43 Briefly, pre-processing included
image registration and normalization to MNI coordinates using SPM12 (University College London,
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The accumulation rate of the contrast-agent during the slow
enhancement period of the scan (6-20 mins.) was calculated for each voxel. To compensate for
physiological (e.g., heart rate, blood flow) and technical (e.g., injection rate) variabilities between
scans, each voxel’s accumulation rate was normalized to that of the superior sagittal sinus. The
normalized contrast-agent accumulation rates were defined as the unit-of-measure for BBB
permeability, with near-zero/negative values reflecting BBB-protected tissue and positive values
representing tissue with tracer accumulation due to cross BBB extravasation. Abnormally high BBB
permeability was defined using an intensity threshold of the 95th percentile of all values in a cohort
of control subjects.13
Region-Specific BBB Imaging Analysis
To quantify region-specific BBB leakage, each scan was segmented into 126
anatomically/functionally significant areas in accordance with the MNI brain atlas
(https://github.com/neurodebian/spm12/tree/master/tpm). The number of voxels with abnormally
high BBB permeability (contrast accumulation rates exceeding the above-mentioned intensity
threshold13) was quantified within each region and divided by the total number of voxels comprising
the region. This ratio was defined as the percent of region volume affected by abnormally high BBB
permeability, and was used as the measure of region-specific BBB damage.
Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
Resting state MEG data were collected using an Elekta Neuromag whole head 306-channel MEG
system.14 Standard operating procedures were utilized for continuous head position monitoring.
Electrooculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data were recorded for the removal of
physiological artifacts. Research participants were scanned in the seated position in a magnetically

shielded room with active shielding enabled. Two resting-state datasets were acquired: one with the
subject’s eyes open and the other with eyes closed, each with a 15-minute duration. MEG data were
sampled continuously during all resting state recordings at 1000 Hz and band-pass filtered at 0.1-330
Hz.
MEG Data Analysis
Data was analyzed from 11 recently exposed and 12 remotely exposed individuals and compared to
61 age-matched controls. Controls included 11 non-exposed individuals from the present cohort and
10 healthy controls recorded in the same MEG from a previous cohort. Additional data from 40 agematched healthy controls (mean age=42.6 ± 11.15 years) was obtained from the CamCAN repository
(available at http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/datasets/camcan/). Preprocessing using signal space
separation44 was conducted to account for active shielding and to remove sources external to the
MEG helmet. Additional analysis was performed on 10-15 min eye-closed recordings using in-house
Matlab scripts: Data was down-sampled to 250 Hz and band-pass filtered in the range 1.0-50 Hz.
Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify components correlated with EOG and
ECG time courses due to vertical eye movements and blinks, as well as cardiac signals. The
corresponding components were removed, and the data was visually inspected in the time domain to
remove time segments containing clear artifacts. Spectral analysis by fast furrier transform (FFT) and
bandwidth power (1-3, 3-8, 8-12, 12-20, and 20-50 Hz) were calculated for each channel buffered
into 2-second long epochs with 1-second overlap, averaged across all epochs, normalized to the total
power of the respective channel, and averaged across all channels to compare between subjects. For
each activity epoch, the median-power frequency (MPF) was extracted. Periods of paroxysmal slow
wave events (PSWEs) were defined as time periods of brain activity in which the MPF was < 6 Hz
for > 5 seconds.

Serum acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BChE) activity were measured in a
microtiter plate assay using a SpectraMax M3 according to published methods.45 10l of 1:40 diluted
serum in Tris-HCl buffer was incubated in tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA, 100M),
a specific BChE inhibitor, or 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl) (BW, 20M), a specific
AChE inhibitor, for 20 minutes. Following incubation, diluted serum was added in triplicates to a 96well plate. Readings of AChE and BChE activity were repeated at 2-minute intervals for 20 minutes
at 405nm following the addition of acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCh, 1mM) or s-butyrylthiocholine
iodide crystalline (BTCh, 10mM) substrates, respectively, and Ellman’s reagent (10mM). A cysteine
standard of known concentrations was used to calculate enzyme activity.
Sample Preparation and Analysis for Toxicology
Serum for mass spectrometry analysis samples were prepared as described elsewhere.46 QuEChERS
(Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe) salt mixtures (50 mg MgSO 4 and 12.5 mg NaCl) was
added to the 125 µL of serum sample in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to facilitate phase separation
and extraction of target analytes. Samples were vortexed for 15 seconds to break up salt
agglomerates. 125 µL of acetonitrile (ACN) was added to the samples to extract target analytes. The
samples were shaken vigorously by hand for 1 minute. Thermo Scientific Accela UHPLC system
with the CTC Analytics PAL autosampler coupled to the Exactive Plus orbital ion trap mass
spectrometer was used for all sample analyses.
A total of six insecticides or their metabolites reported to be used in Cuba and neighboring countries
were chosen as targets, including Cypermethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, two active ingredients of
serpol: Tilt (propiconazole - triazole fungicide) and permethrin (a pyrethroid insecticide), as well as
deltamethrin chlorpyrifos and Temephos—both organophosphorus insecticides. The final target
analyte chosen for this study was 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a common pyrethroid metabolite.

Cholinesterase Inhibitors and Insecticides
Cholinesterase (ChE) is one of the key enzymes required for the proper functioning of the nervous
systems of humans, other vertebrates, and insects, breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
and preventing its action in the junction between nerves and muscles as well as between two nerve
cells.
While the source of exposure to toxins of the cholinesterase inhibitor family is not yet confirmed in
our study, the use of insecticides readily and evidentially suggests itself. Importantly, certain
chemical classes of pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, work against insects by
inhibiting the action of cholinesterase, but can also be poisonous to humans.
Most of the literature on low-level exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) in humans is
epidemiological in nature, resulting from dietary ingestion and occupational exposure.47 The major
concerns related to such exposure are delayed effects on the function of the nervous system and
increased prevalence of cognitive, behavioral, and psychomotor dysfunction.30,48,49 The exact
mechanisms of damage, however, are not known, and additional targets for these toxins (in addition
to ChE inhibition) were suggested, including other neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, and
enzymes related to the metabolism of beta amyloid protein and neuroinflammation.

Appendix Figure 2. Visual Summary of Findings

Based on the clinical course, pattern of injury, and brain regions involved, we raise the hypothesis of lowdose environmental exposure to cholinesterase-inhibitors (e.g., organophosphates) as a likely cause and
working medical diagnosis, with insecticides being a possible source. This narrower hypothesis
(insecticides) gains contextual support from Cuba’s well-documented efforts to mitigate the spread of the
Zika virus by means of mass indoor and outdoor fumigations (see Figure 5A-B in main article above),16,17
Canadian embassy records indicating heavy fumigation (Figure 5C), and toxicological findings in the blood
(Figure 5F).
We propose that cholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphates are the underlying cause for reduced
cholinesterase activity in recently exposed individuals (Figure 5D-E), according to the following
mechanism: organophosphates cause BBB opening and dysfunction of specific cholinergic brain centers
(brainstem nuclei and basal forebrain, marked in blue; Figures 2-3). Consequently, axonal fibres from the
basal forebrain through the fornix and to the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri (marked in red) are
injured (Figure 2), leading to impaired spatial memory (Appendix Table 5). Dysfunction of the basal
forebrain and the related diffuse cholinergic cortical innervation underlies cortical rhythmic slowing
observed in MEG (Figure 4).

Appendix Figure 3. Visual Breakdown of Study Cohort
(Return to Top)

We tested 26 Canadian adult subjects for evaluation: 23 were considered “exposed” while 12 were considered “nonexposed,” with double testing (pre- and post-exposure) accounting for overlap between the two groups.
Within the exposed group, we tested 11 individuals within one month of their return from Havana, a group we classified
as “recently exposed,” and 12 individuals 1-19 months after returning (median 14 months), a group we classified as
“remotely exposed,” with double testing accounting for overlap between these two subgroups.
In particular, 8 participants were tested both prior to and immediately upon returning from Havana (forming part of both
non-exposed and recent test groups), while 1 recently exposed subject was tested again as a remote subject.
