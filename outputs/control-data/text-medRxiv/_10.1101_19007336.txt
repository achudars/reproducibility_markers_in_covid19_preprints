Abstract
Objectives: Evaluate clinical outcomes associated with implementing a specialist pneumonia
intervention nursing (SPIN) service, to improve adherence with BTS guidelines for
hospitalised community acquired pneumonia (CAP).
Design: Retrospective cohort study, comparing periods before (2011-13) and after (2014-16)
SPIN service implementation.
Setting: Single NHS trust across two hospital sites in Leicester City, England
Participants: 13,496 adult (aged ≥16) admissions to hospital with a primary diagnosis of
CAP
Interventions: The SPIN service was set up in 2013/2014 to provide clinical review of new
CAP admissions; assurance of guidelines adherence; delivery of CAP clinical education and
clinical follow up after discharge.
Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were proportions of CAP cases receiving
antibiotic treatment within 4 hours of admission and change in crude in-hospital mortality
rate. Secondary outcomes were adjusted mortality rate and length of stay (LOS).
Results: The SPIN service reviewed 38% of CAP admissions in 2014-16. 82% of these
admissions received antibiotic treatment in <4 hours (68.5% in the national audit). Compared
with the pre-SPIN period, there was a significant reduction in both 30-day (OR=0.77 [0.700.85], p<0.0001) and in-hospital mortality (OR=0.66 [0.60-0.73], p<0.0001) after service
implementation, with a review by the service having the largest independent 30-day mortality
benefit (HR=0.60 [0.53-0.67], p<0.0001). There was no change in LOS (median 6 days).

is low cost, highly effective and readily adoptable in secondary care.
Key Messages
What is the key question?
Does a specialist nurse-led intervention affect BTS guideline adherence and mortality for
patients admitted to hospital with community acquired pneumonia (CAP)?
What is the bottom line?
Implementing specialist nurse teams for CAP delivers improved guideline adherence and
survival for patients admitted with the condition.
Why read on?
This study shows a low-cost specialist nursing service focussed on CAP is associated with a
significant improvement in BTS guidelines adherence and patient survival.
Introduction
Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality, with a
crude rate of 5-15%, rising to 30% for in patients who are admitted to ICU [1]. Pneumonia is
responsible for more hospital admissions and bed days than any other lung disease in the UK
and annual healthcare costs to the NHS associated with CAP are estimated to exceed £1
billion. Despite this, pneumonia has historically been a substantially underestimated,
frequently neglected and underfunded condition in the UK. This was recognised in the
recently published NHS Long Term Plan [2] which highlights CAP as an NHS research
priority for new treatments and care pathways.
CAP mortality is known to be associated with disease severity and a number of scores have
been developed to quantify this, of which CURB-65 [3] is implemented most widely in
practice. These scores are intended to improve the provision of prompt and appropriate
clinical care for pneumonia and their benefit for guiding clinical intervention has been
demonstrated in a national implementation project that reported lower 30 day in-hospital
mortality associated with prompt radiological diagnosis and severity based treatment [4,5].
This suggests that prognosis in CAP is modifiable and can be improved with better models of
healthcare delivery.
University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust (UHL) provides emergency admissions facilities
for a catchment population of 1 million people. The Trust previously registered higher than
expected externally reported Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicators (SHMI) [6]
associated with primary diagnosis of CAP. In response, we created a dedicated specialist
pneumonia intervention nursing (SPIN) service in 2013/14 with the aims of i) improving
systematic CURB-65 scoring for CAP admissions; and ii) improving and accelerating
adherence to key components of the BTS pneumonia guidelines. This included radiological
diagnosis and prompt antibiotic treatment within 4 hours of admission. In addition, the SPIN
team led a trust-wide educational and awareness-raising campaign on the importance of

guidelines based management of acute CAP cases and facilitated radiological follow up after
discharge.
In this five year retrospective cohort study, comparing periods before, during and after
implementation of the SPIN service, we report on the effectiveness of this nurse led
programme of interventions for improving guidelines adherence and the impact of the SPIN
service on crude in-hospital mortality, SHMI and HSMR (Hospital Standardized Mortality
Ratio).
Methods
This manuscript follows the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0
guidelines for study design and analysis [7].
The SPIN Team
In 2013/14 a new SPIN service was created, to which two nurses were appointed and tasked
with implementation of key measures to improve diagnosis and prompt management of CAP
admissions. The nurse posts were funded through the Commissioning for Quality and
Innovation payments framework for two years before long term funding was secured.
An assessment checklist based on the BTS pneumonia guidelines was devised
(Supplementary File 1). This checklist was printed on adhesive stickers for the medical notes
and served as an educational resource for awareness raising during the implementation
period. Embedded management guidance was disseminated widely using wall posters in
admission areas, the hospital intranet and as part of dedicated education modules delivered by
the team. The service was operational weekdays between 9am and 5pm.
Eligible emergency admissions were identified from daily ward list screening, review of
admission chest x-rays on the picture archiving and communication system and in response to
electronic or verbal referral of patients with CAP (Figure 1). Cases were predominantly seen
in acute medical admission areas at both UHL emergency sites (Leicester Royal Infirmary
and Glenfield Hospital). Severity scores (CURB-65) and interventions were prospectively
recorded and time stamped for admissions physically seen by the SPIN team using bespoke
intranet database facilities (NIHR Biomedical Research Centre - Respiratory, Leicester).

Data extraction and analysis
Data across five financial years (FY) were categorised into three periods for comparative
analysis: i) a two year baseline period (FY 2011/12 - 2012/13) prior to availability of the
SPIN service; ii) a one year implementation phase (FY 2013/14) during which the SPIN
service was set up and operationalised; and iii) a two year intervention period (FY 2014/15 2015/16) when SPIN services were fully operational. This period was stratified further
according to cases seen or not seen by the nursing service.
To ensure UHL admissions data was representative and unaffected by clinical coding bias,
comparative per-hospital trust admission frequency data was obtained from Telstra/Dr Foster.
Individual CAP coded hospital episodes from the study period were extracted from the
hospital data warehouse by adapting the algorithm used by Telstra/Dr Foster for their quality
and outcomes analysis. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) clinical codes
representing pneumonia in the Clinical Classifications Software [8] group were used
(Supplementary File 2) for this purpose. A patient and date/time matching algorithm linked
CAP database intervention data to coded admission records, prior to anonymisation for
analysis. Additional data fields derived from the anonymised admissions data were length of
stay (LOS), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) [6,9], and time to death in days and weeks.
CCI and age were categorised into groups of 0, 1-5 and >5, and 16 - 65 and >65, respectively.
The presence of heart disease and/or diabetes comorbidities in admissions were determined
by comparing secondary diagnoses with ICD-10 code lists (Supplementary File 3).
All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.3.1 [10]. Comparisons between
baseline and intervention variables were performed using the chi-square test, with Wald’s
method used to calculate 95% confidence intervals. SHMI and HSMR adjusted outcome data
were provided by Telstra/Dr Foster and included alongside the results.
Survival analysis utilised Kaplan-Meir (KM) curves and Cox proportional hazards (PH)
models. Patients were censored if they had died after the one-year period examined or if they
had survived beyond this time. KM survival analysis was carried out between baseline and
intervention groups using time to death. A Cox PH model was constructed including potential
confounding variables. Male gender and weekend admission were included as binary
variables, age and CCI as continuous variables.
Patient and Public Involvement
The investigation did not include PPI in the design, analysis, or interpretation of this data.
The analysis was done using anonymised data, and therefore we were unable to work with
participants or disseminate the results to them.
Results
Descriptive CAP admission statistics
There were 13,496 CAP admissions to UHL between FY 2011 - 2016. The median age of
admissions was 77.0 (IQR 64.0 - 86.0) years. Compared with the baseline period, there was
an increase during the intervention period in the number of hospital admissions for CAP
(4,143 vs 7,029). Standardised stationary series comparing monthly local CAP admission

frequency at UHL with UK frequencies demonstrated concordance in the trend and
seasonality of cases (Supplementary File 4). The rise in CAP admissions during the
intervention period was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of patients with CAP
aged >65 years (72.0% vs 73.8%, OR=1.09 [1.00-1.19], p<0.046) and the proportion with
complex co-morbidities (CCI >5) (from 41.9% to 47.8%, OR=1.27 [1.18-1.38], p<0.0001)

Successful implementation and improved delivery of key interventions
Between implementation and the final interventional year, the SPIN nurses saw an increasing
proportion of admitted CAP cases, rising from 34.1% (FY 2013/14) to 42.0% (FY 2015/16).
Associated with this was a year on year improvement in compliance with guidelines based
interventions (Table 2), with all interventions implemented in >80% of admissions seen by
the service. In particular, the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics within 4 hours of
admission (80.6%) and dual antibiotic treatment data for severe CAP (CURB-65 score 3-5)
(86.3%) exceeded reported figures for these variables from the national audit [11] (68.5% and
48.0%, respectively).

Improved mortality
The overall crude in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were 16.6% and 20.1%, respectively.
This was aligned with hospital episode statistics (HES) derived crude mortality rates reported
by all other NHS trusts at baseline (Figure 2). Externally reported adjusted mortality rates,
SHMI and HSMR, improved year on year following the implementation period. Comparing
the baseline period with the intervention period (Table 3), a significant reduction in mortality
was observed for both in-hospital mortality (OR=0.66 [0.60-0.73], p<0.0001) and 30-day
mortality (OR=0.77 [0.70-0.85], p <0.0001) that was greatest in the subgroup of admissions
seen by the SPIN nurses (in-hospital mortality: OR=0.49 [0.42-0.56], p<0.0001; 30-day
mortality: OR= 0.55 [0.48-0.63], p<0.0001). A smaller but significant reduction in mortality
was also observed in the intervention period for patients not seen by the SPIN service
(OR=0.77 [0.69-0.86], p<0.0001). The Cox PH model demonstrated being seen by the SPIN
service to have had the largest independent effect on mortality reduction (HR=0.60 [0.530.67], p<0.0001) (Figure 3).

UHL mortality rates are highlighted by large grey dots.
Black dots indicate outliers that are outside the interval [Q1 – 1.5 x IQR, Q3 + 1.5 x IQR]
where Q1 = 1st quartile, Q3 = 3rd quartile and IQR is interquartile range
Ratios are expected/observed deaths from all pneumonias over the year.
The median LOS for CAP admissions (6 days) did not change significantly throughout the
five year period and was unaffected by the SPIN service.
Discussion
CAP remains the most common cause of in-hospital death and the UK ranks only 21st out of
99 countries for age adjusted mortality [12]. Although better adherence to the BTS
pneumonia guidelines is recognised to be associated with improved survival trends in
national audits [5,11], our experience suggests there is widely inconsistent implementation of
this across different departments at large NHS organisations. Reasons for this are
multifactorial and include widely fluctuating seasonal admission levels for respiratory tract
infections, fluctuating medical staffing levels in and out of hours and inadequate provision of
resource to support services for this common but neglected condition. Here we demonstrate
how, for a large and geographically disparate NHS organisation, a novel SPIN service model,
comprised of only two specialist nurses working normal hours five days a week could
effectively overcome this variability in the provision of care. This model achieved sustained
improvements in care bundle delivery that correlated with significant reductions in crude and
adjusted mortality rates for hospital admissions with CAP. In particular, our observation that
the SPIN intervention appeared to reduce 30 day mortality to 13.7%, compared with the
reported UK average of 17.3% [11] supports the view that suboptimal care for CAP
admissions is an important driver of national mortality rates and justifies prioritisation of
CAP in the recently published NHS Long Term Plan [2].
Implementation of the SPIN service improved outcome in CAP cases that were not seen by
the service, indicating value and impact of education and awareness raising of CAP at a trust
wide level. Given the high turnover in medical and nursing staff, sustaining this secondary
benefit will require ongoing reinforcement of key messages by the service and should be
viewed as an empirical component of the package of services that are provided.
There are some potential limitations to our analysis as we used a retrospective cohort design.
However, it would be neither ethical nor feasible to perform a randomised prospective study
to demonstrate effectiveness of these interventions for a condition known to have a poor
outcome. Importantly our data confirm that rapid and robustly systematic implementation of
BTS mandated standards of care significantly improve CAP prognosis, independent of
disease severity, age and existing co-morbidities. The magnitude of the effect size we
observed is at least equivalent to the development of new therapies for CAP and justifies the
importance of improving care pathways for delivering existing resources.

Shortcomings of coded hospital episode data have been previously described, leading to
concerns that CAP cases may be under represented in HES data [13,14]. However, our SPIN
service model required the nurses to confirm presence of consolidation on admission chest xrays. We believe this provides a key check point to increase the overall accuracy of
pneumonia coding. To address the possibility that coding bias was introduced by adoption of
the SPIN service, we compared our local hospital pneumonia coding frequencies with peer
trusts and rates recorded across the UK, using standardised stationary series and found our
data to be concordant.
Selection bias may have been introduced when comparing outcomes for those seen or not
seen by the SPIN team during the intervention period. Indeed, higher levels of comorbidities
and increased mean age were evident in patients not reviewed by the SPIN team during the
intervention period that reflects a scarcity of resource within the existing SPIN service.
However, a Cox PH model that included age and CCI as independent factors demonstrated
the SPIN intervention to have the strongest independent effect on mortality (Figure 3). On
this basis, we intend to expand the service with recruitment of more specialist nurses,
providing extended cover to facilitate more equitable access to the service for admitted CAP
patients.
The national pneumonia audit focussed particularly on prescribing of dual antibiotics for
cases of severe pneumonia (CURB-65 3-5). Our analysis examined this point in great detail
and found significantly higher compliance with dual antibiotic prescribing compared to the
national audit in patients seen by the SPIN team. UHL prescribing policy favours
doxycycline over macrolides as the second antibiotic in severe pneumonia. This guidance
remained consistent throughout the five year observation period.
Affecting more than 250,000 people in the UK annually, CAP continues to impact drastically
on UK healthcare systems, and an ageing population is projected to lead to large increases in
pneumonia admissions over the next two decades [13]. In this context we conclude relatively
simple specialist nurse led interventions appear to provide an effective strategy with high
impact at low cost. Wider adoption of the model across the acute care sector could help
transform the outcome for large numbers of emergency admissions with this life threatening
condition.
