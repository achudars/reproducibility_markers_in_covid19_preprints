ABSTRACT

20

Background: Multimorbidity (MM) is one of the major challenges health systems currently

21

face. Management of time length of a medical consultation with a patient with MM is a matter

22

of concern for doctors.

23

Objectives: To describe the impact of MM on the average time of a medical consultation.

24

Methods: A systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for

25

Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The systematic online searches

26

of the Embase and PubMed databases were undertaken, from January 2000 to August 2018.

27

The studies were independently screened by two reviewers to decide which ones met the

28

inclusion criteria. (Kappa=0.84 and Kappa=0.82). Differing opinions were solved by a third

29

person. This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more

30

chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined

31

– the length of medical appointments with patients with MM. Any strategies aiming to analyse

32

the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered. The length of time of

33

medical appointment for patients without MM was the comparator criteria. Experimental and

34

observational studies were included.

35

Results: Of 85 articles identified, only 1 observational study was included, showing a clear

36

trend for patients with MM to have longer consultations than patients without MM criteria

37

(p<0.001).

38

Conclusions: More studies are necessary to assess better allocation length-time for patients

39

with MM and to measure other characteristics like doctors workload.

Keywords: Multimorbidity; Medical appointment; Quality of healthcare; Consultation length-

1. INTRODUCTION

44

Multimorbidity (MM) is defined by the European General Practice Research Network

45

as "any combination of chronic disease with at least one other disease (acute or chronic) or

46

biopsychosocial factor (associated or not) or somatic risk factor”. 1 This is sometimes simplified

47

to, “the simultaneous occurrence of two or more chronic diseases in the same individual”. 2

48

MM is now one of the main challenges faced by health systems at an international level and

49

occupies a considerable part of the daily activity of General Practitioners/Family Doctors

50

(GPs/FMs) around the world.3-6

51

With an ever ageing world population, MM and its consequences, are becoming a

52

major issue in public health and primary care. According to United Nations data,7,8 Europe has

53

the largest percentage of population aged 60 or over (25%). 7 In 2015 the number of people in

54

the world aged 60 years and older was 901 million. 8 It is projected that in 2030 this figure will

55

rise to 1.4 billion (a 56% increase since 2015) and stand at 2.1 billion in 2050.8 Several studies

56

have shown that there is a significant association between age 2 and the prevalence of MM,

57

most national health systems not being prepared or able to cope with this rapid ageing with

58

many demands.5,6

59

So it is imperative to think about the approach to patients with MM to maximize the

60

quality of services provided by the Health Services (HS) consequently guaranteeing a better

61

quality of life for such patients.

62

GPs/FMs medical team face various difficulties in caring for a patient with MM like lack

63

of resources; consultation time restrictions; lack of interdisciplinary care/teams; inadequate

64

patient support (largely relying on community-based support services); inadequate tools

65

(guidelines are drawn up strictly for specific diseases and not for the MM patient); the attitude

66

of the patient (often discouraged and poorly engaged). 4,9

67

Information about the length-time of a consultation with a patient with MM is essential

68

to better organize and deliver healthcare. To our knowledge, no previous review has

69

summarized data related to: “What is the impact of having MM on the medical consultation?”

70

“Is the average length-time consultation with a patient with MM longer than for a patient without

71

MM?”

87

2. METHODS

88

A systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for

89

Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-

90

analysis with:

91

2.1 Eligibility criteria

92

Articles about people with MM. The most widely used definition of MM was used, which

93

is the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in the same individual. 2 The World Health

94

Organization (WHO) definition of chronic disease was adopted, namely, “health problems that

95

require ongoing management over a period of years or decades”.10

96

Studied outcome: explicitly defined length-time of medical appointments with patients

97

with MM. Any strategies aiming to analyse the impact of MM on the average consultation time

98

were considered. Studies which did not specify the time spent on medical appointments were

99

excluded.

100
101
102
103

The length of time of medical appointment for patients without MM was the comparator
criteria.
Experimental and observational studies were included.
2.2 Information sources and search strategy

104

The systematic online searches were undertaken using combinations of keywords in

105

the following electronic databases: the Embase and PubMed databases, from 1 st January

106

2000 until the 31st August 2018 to find pertinent studies.

107
108

The search was limited to papers in English, Portuguese, Spanish and French. No
other limits were imposed during this stage of the study.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment

111

The potentially relevant studies were selected in two stages. First, the titles and

112

abstracts quoted in the literature search were independently screened by two reviewers (CT

113

and IF) to decide which ones met the inclusion criteria (Kappa=0.84). Those not meeting the

114

inclusion criteria were excluded. Differing opinions on studies inclusion were resolved by a

115

third person (IR).

116

Secondly, the researchers independently read and analysed the integrity of the

117

matching studies and tried to reach an agreement concerning eligibility (Kappa=0.82). Those

118

not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded. The quality and risk of bias of the included

119

studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), more precisely, the

120

Newcastle-Ottawa scale adapted for cross-sectional studies.11 This tool assesses three

121

aspects of a study: the selection of the sample; the comparability of the groups; and the

122

outcome (assessment of outcome and statistical test). It is composed of 7 items and classifies

123

the study in 4 possible levels: Very good (9-10 points), Good (7-8 points), Satisfactory (5-6

124

points) and Unsatisfactory (0-4 points). Any disagreement was resolved through consensus.

125

This systematic review was conducted using Covidence13, the standard production

126

platform used for Cochrane reviews, which was used for the data and records management.

127

2.4 Outcomes and statistical analysis

128

The patients were split into two groups, those with and those without MM, and

129

the relative frequencies were calculated. The results were analyzed using the chi-square

130

distribution test.

3. RESULTS

135

3.1 Study selection

136

As described in Flowchart 1, the electronic database searches started with 85

137

potentially eligible references (26 in PubMed and 59 in Embase). Of these, 5 were duplicates

138

and were thus excluded and 31 were considered irrelevant based on a review of the title and

139

abstract. The remnant studies were fully read, analysed and assessed for eligibility, 36 being

140

excluded due to wrong outcome 3,12-46, 5 because of wrong study design47-51, 4 due to wrong

141

patient population9,52-54, 2 for wrong language55-56 and 1 for wrong setting57. In the end, 1 study

142

was included.58

3.2 Study characteristics and quality
The main relevant features and outputs of the study were extracted for the purpose of
this systematic review and are summed up in Table 1.

152

The included study was conducted between 2008 and 2009 in Denmark, over 12

153

months. It involved 404 general practitioners (GPs) participants and a total of 8236 contacts.

154

It included patients aged 40 years or more, grouped as those without any chronic condition

155

and those with one, two, three or more chronic conditions.

156

During the study period, the GPs completed a one-page registration form for each of

157

their patient contacts. Of the various items that were registered, the ones relevant forthis

158

review were information on chronic diseases and length-time of consultation. Quality

159

assessment result, performed as described in methodology, is presented in Table 2. The

160

quality of the study was considered satisfactory (score 6 out of a maximum score of 10), its

161

main weakness being in the comparability section.

3.3 Results of study

190

Table 3 shows the relationship between the length of consultation time and the type

191

of patient (with and without MM). There is a clear significant trend for patients with MM to

192

have longer consultations than patients without MM (p<0.001).

193

More than 25% of MM patients had a consultation length-time of at least 16 minutes

194

while more than 75% of the patients without MM had a consultation length-time under 15

195

minutes. Length-time consultation on both types of patients is more frequently between 6 and

196

15 minutes. There is a significant difference, however, in the percentage of patients with MM

197

requiring more time than patients without MM criteria.

4. DISCUSSION

206

The present systematic review sought to answer the following question: “Is the average

207

consultation time spent on patients with MM longer than that spent on patients who do not

208

meet the MM criteria?” could only identify one study,58 undertaken in Denmark, in which the

209

consultation time was logged as a function of the number of chronic diseases. This study

210

revealed a tendency for consultations to take longer for patients with MM than for those without

211

MM. However, the study was not directly aimed at answering this question and it did not take

212

confounding factors into account. In addition, it does not describe the calculation to determine

213

the sample size of the study and it could be inaccurate to study this specific outcome. So the

214

study was classified as “Satisfactory”.

215

The small number of publications in the literature on this subject shows that more

216

studies should be designed to investigate the impact of MM on the consultation length-time. It

217

is vital to analyse this issue in order to manage resources so that they meet the actual need,

218

and to ensure the services provided by health services, national or private, are appropriate. It

219

will thus be possible to guarantee better quality health services and outcomes for these

220

patients. In fact MM is about a patient with more then two chronic diseases or one chronic

221

disease with biopsychosocial factor (associated or not) or somatic risk factor, so illness being

222

included and not only about the specific sufferances.1,9

223

In studies with calculated size population representative random samples it is

224

important that accurate methods are used to measure the real length-time of a consultation

225

(i.e. from the moment that the doctor opens the patient’s file to the moment it is closed). Using

226

stop-watches and self-reporting will probably lead to inaccuracies. The calculation of the

227

length-time of the consultation obtained by dividing the total time a medical practitioner is in

228

the clinic by the number of patients could yield average times that mask the real duration of

229

each patient’s consultation. Also confounding factors must be eliminated as the time spent on

230

administrative work, breaks and work meetings. Only direct observation using video recording

11

231

has been proven to obtain accurate values when measuring the duration of consultations, 59

232

which could be a procedure that mitigates many of the errors previously mentioned. The

233

length-time of a consultation must be measured accurately to avoid errors and skewed

234

judgements. It is essential to identify beforehand any possible confounding factors inherent to

235

the patients (for example, hearing difficulty, education level, age, socio-economic level),

236

inherent to the doctor (in particular, a change in behaviour due to the participation in the

237

research study – Hawthorne effect60), and inherent to the consultation/institution (for example,

238

glitches in computer systems, organization of necessary information in the health informatics

239

records, coding errors, telephone call interruptions). The time lost searching for information in

240

consultation, the friendliness of clinical informatics and the time spent on e.records are also

241

issues to be studied and thought of 61, 62. Health determinants are factors to be studied in such

242

a MM population for better health and social outcomes.63

243

The data analysis must be evaluated using objective validated laboratory methods

244

and, if possible, it should be a blind assessment. Statistical tests used to analyse the data

245

must be appropriate and clearly described. Measures of association, including confidence

246

intervals and the P value, must be presented.

247

The main limitation of this systematic review was the difficulty in ensuring that all the

248

relevant literature was included. Even though the research used two of the main databases –

249

Pubmed and Embase – there could be other relevant material in grey literature.

250

The scarcity of the literature that was found was a limitation for this review. The one

251

publication found, besides not directly answering our question, also does not take confounding

252

factors into account, and does not describe the calculation to determine the sample size of the

253

study. However, it does highlight the relevance of the subject matter.

5. CONCLUSIONS
This “impact of MM on the duration of a consultation” has hardly been studied, this
systematic review shows.
A tendency for consultations of patients with MM to take longer than those without MM
was found in the only one study with “satisfactory” quality which met the inclusion criteria.

263

So more research is needed to acquire more information on this subject, important to

264

deal not only with diseases but with the person suffering from MM for consultation must have

265

the adequate length duration to enable doctors and stake-holders with a proper quantification

266

of the time and associated costs.

267

If a longer consultation time is confirmed, it will be important to rethink and adapt GPs’

268

lists of patients in order to achieve better medical care providing agendas with specific times

269

and allocating enough time for all the required tasks.
