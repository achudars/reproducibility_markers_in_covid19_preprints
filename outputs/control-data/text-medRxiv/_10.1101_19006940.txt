Abstract

12

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne disease, known for its high death and disability rate among

13

symptomatic cases. Many effective vaccines are available for JE, and the use of a recently developed and

14

inexpensive vaccine has been increasing over the recent years particularly with Gavi support. Estimates of

15

the local burden and the past impact of vaccination are therefore increasingly needed, but difficult due to

16

the limitations of JE surveillance. In this study, we implemented a mathematical modelling method

17

combined with age-stratifed case data which can overcome some of these limitations. We estimate in

18

2015 JE infections caused 100,308 cases (95%CI: 61,720 - 157,522) and 25,125 deaths (95%CI: 14,550 -

19

46,031), and that between 2000 and 2015 307,774 JE cases (95%CI: 167,442- 509,583) were averted due

20

to vaccination. Our results highlight areas that could have the greatest benefit from starting vaccination or

21

from scaling up existing programs and will be of use to support local and international policymakers in

22

making vaccine allocation decisions.

Introduction

24

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) – an arbovirus that belongs to

25

the flavivirus genus, family flaviviridae. The main mosquito vectors are the Culex, especially Culex

26

tritaenuirhynchus, which thrive in rice-paddy fields (Buescher and Scherer 1959; Self et al. 1973). JEV

27

has a wide range of vertebrate hosts, noticeably the amplifying hosts are thought to be pigs and wading

28

birds (SAGE Working Group on Japanese encephalitis vaccines 2014). Humans are dead-end hosts as

29

viremia is not believed to reach levels that are infectious to mosquitoes (SAGE Working Group on

30

Japanese encephalitis vaccines 2014). Only 1 in 25 to 1 in 1000 infections result in symptoms (Vaughn

31

and Hoke 1992; SAGE Working Group on Japanese encephalitis vaccines 2014). However, the mortality

32

rate of symptomatic cases is high - around 20-30% (Fischer et al. 2008), and around 30-50% of survivors

33

experience significant neurological and psychiatric sequelae (Fischer et al. 2008).

34

The first JE case was documented in Japan in 1871 (WHO 2015). In 1924, a first JE outbreak in Japan

35

caused more than 6, 000 cases and 3, 000 deaths in 6 weeks (Solomon 2006). Several outbreaks occurred

36

subsequently in Asia (Hullinghorst 1951; Erlanger et al. 2009; Barzaga 1990). More recently, in 2005

37

large outbreaks occurred in northern India and Nepal, with 5,000 cases and 1,300 deaths (Solomon 2006).

38

Currently, 24 Asia-Pacific countries are thought to be endemic for JE, with 3 billion individuals at risk of

39

infection (WHO 2015).

40

The first vaccination was an inactivated mouse brain vaccine produced in Japan, used worldwide for 50

41

years. Although vaccine production halted in 2006, similar inactivated mouse brain vaccines are still

42

produced locally in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (Yun and Lee 2013). The next

43

vaccination, an inactivated a Vero cell vaccine (SAGE Working Group on Japanese encephalitis vaccines

44

2014), has been gradually replaced (since 1988) by a live attenuated vaccine (SA 14-14-2) produced in

45

China. SA 14-14-2 is now widely used in Asia and funded by Gavi, greatly increasing the use. This

46

vaccine requires only a single dose, is cheap to produce, and is safer than the mouse brain vaccine (SAGE

Working Group on Japanese encephalitis vaccines 2014). In addition, a live attenuated chimeric vaccine

48

was first licensed in Australia in 2012 (SAGE Working Group on Japanese encephalitis vaccines 2014).

49

WHO recommends two JE surveillance systems, i) a subnational system with sentinel hospitals, or ii)

50

case-based nationwide surveillance. Each country implements one of these systems depending on

51

available resources (Hills et al. 2009). WHO recommends diagnosis using JEV-specific IgM antibody-

52

capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) in CSF at two time points (Donadeu et al.

53

2009; Burke and Leake 1988). Serum samples can be used, but false positives may result from cross-

54

reactivity with other flaviviruses or vaccination (Solomon et al. 1998; Hills et al. 2009). Other tests that

55

can confirm JE are plaque reduction neutralizing (PRNT), haemagglutination inhibition (HI),

56

immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence assay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction

57

(RT-PCR) or virus isolation (Hills et al. 2009), though these are not often used.

58

The previous estimate of annual global JE cases was 67,900 with 13,600 – 20,400 deaths (Campbell et al.

59

2011). For this estimate a systematic review in 2011 collated case incidence data from endemic JE

60

countries. Countries were then stratified into 10 incidence groups based on geographic, ecological and

61

vaccine program similarities. The systematic review resulted in 12 key studies, which were then used to

62

infer the incidence rate (IR) of the 10 incidence groups. However the estimation had some limitations; the

63

surveillance quality of the 12 key studies varied and as the case incidence rate combines both the

64

infection rate and vaccination, it is not possible to estimate the impact of vaccination.

65

Poor clinical outcomes and lack of specific treatment makes JE prevention a priority. Vaccination is the

66

most effective method of prevention, however it is difficult to decide where vaccination should be

67

implemented or to estimate the quantitative impact of vaccination (Fischer et al. 2008). In Nepal, one

68

study estimated 3,011 JE cases were prevented in vaccinated districts from 2006 to 2012 (Upreti et al.

69

2017). Another study in Sarawak Malaysia estimated a 61% reduction in JE cases after the vaccination

70

program, where climate effects were not taken into account, and 45% when the effects of climate were

71

included (Impoinvil et al. 2013). The methods used in both these papers require good surveillance data

72

before and after vaccination, which, though data is improving, is currently not widely available. Hence,

73

new approaches are needed to estimate burden and vaccine impact.

74

In this study, we provide updated global JE burden and vaccination impact estimates using a modelling

75

method which helps overcome some of the limitations of sparse and variable surveillance data. In

76

addition, by simulating the model with and without the undertaken vaccination programs we are able to

77

estimate the impact of vaccination on the number of global JE cases to date and identify areas that would

78

benefit most from future vaccination.

79

Results

80

There are two main stages to our analysis, summarized in flowcharts in Fig 1. In the first stage, we

81

conducted a systematic review to collate age-stratified case data and a literature review to obtain

82

vaccination information. We then fit a model to this data to estimate the transmission intensity or force of

83

infection (FOI) for each study. In the second stage, we extrapolated the FOI for all endemic areas from

84

our previous estimates. Using the processed population and vaccination data in all endemic areas, we used

85

the model to generate burden quantities (cases) in two scenarios, with or without the JE vaccination

86

programs that have been implemented.

catchment area was not clear. Another 4 datasets from JE national reports were collated from Taiwan,

106

Japan, and Sri Lanka. Finally, we had 53 studies that contained age-stratified case data (Fig 2). 42 of the

107

53 studies (79%) contained data from after 2000 only, 7 from before 2000 only and 3 from both time

108

periods (Fig 2- Supp 1). 34 studies (64%) had data from 1-4 year time periods, 6 studies had data for

109

between 5 and 9 years, and 11 studies had data for more than 10 years. The majority of the studies used

110

the WHO JE case definition: JE IgM antibody in CSF or serum as confirmed by MAC-ELISA on patients

111

with acute encephalitis syndrome. In the majority of studies patients were recruited from a sentinel

112

hospital surveillance system, though these ranged in size from one to several hospitals. For studies with a

113

consistent catchment area but for which data was collected in multiple years, we aggregated the age-

114

stratified case data across years. Further details of the selected studies and data, including about

115

catchment areas, sample collection methods, and vaccination programs are in Figure 2- Supp 1.

116

We obtained the vaccination information from three main sources: literature review, WHO, and Gavi (S2

117

Table). Campaign vaccination information was mainly from Gavi and routine vaccination was from

118

WHO, while the literature contains both. When there were disagreements between the different

119

vaccination information sources, we chose to use the information from the literature review. The total

120

vaccinated population in each country using information obtained from this data from 2000-2015 is

121

shown in Fig 3.

Force of infection estimation from collated age-stratified data

From 53 studies, we made FOI estimates using the catalytic model from 53 unique catchment areas in 15

130

countries (Fig 4). All models converged well and mostly fit well to the data (Fig 4- Supp1). Our FOI

131

estimates varied from 0.001 (95% CI: 0.000 - 0.002) in Japan to 0.507 (95% CI 0.419 - 0.582) in Guigang

132

in China. Besides those extreme values, FOI were generally between 0.05 and 0.2, with a median of 0.09

(Fig 4). We also observed a wide variation in estimated reporting rates

Burden and Vaccine Impact estimation

151

We estimate that from 2000 to 2015, there were 1,976,238 (95% CIs: 1,722,533 - 2,725,647) JE cases

152

globally. By including known annual vaccination information in the catalytic model we estimate that in

153

the same period had there been no vaccination there would have been 2,284,012 (95% CIs: 1,495,964 -

154

3,102,542) JE cases. Therefore we estimate that vaccination programs have prevented 307,774 JE cases

155

globally (95% CI: 167,442- 509,583) from 2000 to 2015 and vaccination programs similarly prevented

156

74,769 deaths from JE (95% CIs: 37,837- 129,028). We estimate the greatest impact of vaccination from

157

2005 - 2010 due to large increase in vaccination in China in this time, and the impact of vaccination

158

became more obvious over time (Fig 5). In 2015, we estimate vaccination reduced the number of cases

159

globally by around 45,000 (from 145,542 (95% CI: 96,667 - 195,639) to 100,308 (95% CI: 61,720 -

160

157,522) (Fig 5).

achieved significant cases averted. Indeed, in the high endemic area in China, the routine vaccination
on

188

programs only started in 2008 but contributed the most to the global cases reduction, with around 20,000

189

cases averted in China in 2015. We also observed a clear difference in cases between vaccination and no

190

vaccination scenario in areas with intensive vaccination program in the past such as South Korea, Sri

191

Lanka, Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam. For Japan, Australia, and Malaysia, though vaccination began a

192

long time ago, we estimated there has been minimal vaccine impact. From the data we collated, no

193

vaccine programs had occurred in in Bangladesh, Brunei, Bhutan, the low and high endemic areas in

194

Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Russia, or Singapore so vaccination has

195

had no impact.

196

Sensitivity analysis

197

To assess the impact of uncertainties in our data and assumptions we performed extensive sensitivity

198

analyses. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for endemic areas with uncertain coverage data, where both

199

national and subnational data were available (China, India and Nepal), or where we did not have any

200

studies. The majority of the results showed minimal changes compared to our original estimates (Fig 5

201

Supp1A-J). Cases estimated from Taiwan subnational data were higher by about 200 to 400 cases before

202

2004 (Fig 5 Supp1C, D). In some areas, we observed significant differences in the estimated cases when

203

the coverage was changed: when the vaccine coverage reduced by 10% and 30% in Sri Lanka or by 30%

204

in Thailand and Taiwan, the mean values of estimated cases increase by around 40, 100, 300, and 220

205

respectively (Fig 5 Supp1G, H). However these changes account for a small fraction of our original global

206

estimates. Sensitivity analysis varying the assumed 100% vaccine effectiveness to 90% and 70% showed

207

global case estimates changed minimally with this assumption (Fig 5 Supp1K, L). In addition due to

208

concerns about possible changes in FOI over times, we also tested our assumption of constant FOI by

209

fitting multiple-year data to a time-dependent catalytic model. Overall, the annual FOI estimates are

210

comparable with the constant FOI (Fig 5 Supp1M).

211

Discussion

212

In this paper, we updated the JE burden estimates with a mathematical modelling method using data we

213

collated from a systematic review. We estimated that in 2015 there were around 100,000 JE cases

214

globally. In addition, we estimate that vaccination programs averted around 45,000 JE cases in 2015.

215

For Japanese encephalitis, since humans are dead-end hosts and therefore vaccination does not lead to

216

herd immunity, the FOI we estimated represents the constant spread of the disease from the animal

217

reservoirs to humans. This spread depends on epidemiological factors related to JE transmission such as

218

climate, rural-urban, mosquito distribution (especially Culex tritaenuirhynchus), and pig and rice field

219

distributions (Le Flohic et al. 2013). This explains why our estimated FOI varies widely. Looking crudely

220

at the pig density (Gilbert et al. 2018) and a Culex tritaenuirhynchus probability map (Miller et al. 2012)

221

there appears to be a broad correlation of these factors with our estimates. The high FOI estimated in the

222

south of China, Vietnam, and Philippines is consistent with the high pig density and high probability of

223

Culex in these areas. We also estimated high FOI in India and Indonesia; however these countries only

224

have high probability of Culex but low pigs density. This suggests that other potential animal reservoirs

225

may contribute to the transmission in these countries, likely the wading bird or even poultry, although

226

current evidence is limited (Lord, Gurley, and Pulliam 2015). In Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan the

227

current estimated FOI is lower compared to other areas, respectively 0.061 (95% CI 0.013 - 0.093), 0.041

228

(95% CI 0.026 - 0.057) and the lowest, 0.001 (95% CI 0.000 - 0.002), despite these areas having high

229

probability of Culex mosquito and high pig density. These countries have had high JE burdens in the past

230

but we do not estimate so currently. This could be due to lack of recent data, or perhaps suggests

231

urbanization, which reduces the proximity of humans to pig farms and rice fields (where the mosquitoes

232

thrive), may play an important role in lowering transmission. This could also be due to uncertainties in the

233

long term vaccination information in these areas. Further work will use environmental covariates to gain

234

estimates of FOI on a smaller spatial scale and over time. In addition, changes in these covariates into the

235

future should be considered in estimates of the future vaccine impact.

236

A strength of our Bayesian approach was the possibility to include prior information on vaccination, but

237

also assess whether this was consistent with the ages distribution of observed cases. For China and Japan

238

we estimated lower susceptible proportions after vaccination in certain age groups compared to calculated

239

proportions from the available data. This suggests that there are a large number of immunized people in

240

certain age groups due to past vaccination for which we did not have information. In Nepal and India, we

241

also observed differences between the data and estimated susceptible proportion after vaccination, though

242

the vaccination information for these countries was more readily available. For India, this could be

243

explained by both uncertainty in vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage data. From 2006 to 2011, SA

244

14-14-2 vaccine was used in India for campaigns. Though the vaccine reported nearly 100% efficacy in

245

vaccine trails, the efficacy in India was reported to be as low as 30% to 40% (Vashishtha and

246

Ramachandran 2015). A previous evaluation of vaccine coverage also showed that the coverage data in

247

India was lower than reported (Murhekar et al. 2017). Further studies are needed to explore whether there

248

are different vaccine efficacies in different places.

249

Using the FOI from 30 endemic areas, we projected the regional and global JE burdens as well as the

250

vaccine impact. By region, our burdens estimates are highest in China and India , which aligns with

251

previous literature (Heffelfinger et al. 2017). Our global estimate of around 100,000 cases annually is

252

about 1.5 times higher than the previous estimate of around 70,000 cases (Campbell et al. 2011). Similar

253

patterns are seen for the comparison area by area, in which our estimates are either higher than or

254

comparable to the previous estimates (Table 1). It is not surprising that our estimates are higher, since our

255

method more robustly takes into account under-reporting and different surveillance quality. In addition,

256

the numbers we reported here are time-dependent and not static because our estimates include population

257

changes and the progression of vaccination programs over time.

Though our methods are more robust, collating 53 studies (an additional 41 from the studies used in the

270

previous burden estimate) (Campbell et al. 2011), and using age-stratified data to circumvent issues with

271

reporting variation, there are still some limitations. As in the previous estimates of JE burden (Campbell

272

et al. 2011), we made inferences for the whole country based on data from a few studies. However in our

273

method we sampled from the FOI estimates from all studies to account for some of this uncertainty and

274

variation. In addition, as in previous studies, a limitation is that we inferred the incidence metric (in our

275

case, FOI) for areas without data, from FOI from other areas, based on previous classification of

276

transmission in these countries. However our sensitivity analysis shows that this does not alter the global

277

burden estimates greatly, though it may affect the country-specific burden estimates. (Campbell et al.

278

2011). Our future work incorporating the epidemiological factors into machine learning algorithms to

279

extrapolate the FOI on smaller spatial scales will help in refining these estimates in the future.

281

We estimated only the impact of vaccination on cases from 2000 - 2015. Because the impact of

282

vaccination will continue into the future as vaccinated individuals remain protected, our estimate will be

283

an underestimate of the total impact of vaccination. In addition, our estimates will be an under-estimate of

284

total vaccine impact as in some places vaccination programs have been running before 2000, and so

285

vaccination had a large impact before 2000. However there is limited information in order to estimate

286

transmission intensity before this time so we focused our work on 2000-2015. In this paper, we focused

287

on cases (and to some extend deaths) from JE. However because a large number of cases have long-term

288

sequelae after JE infection, focus just on case numbers does not describe fully the total burden of JE.

289

Future work will refine the estimates of the proportion of individuals that die and that experience different

290

long-term sequelae, to generate update our model to estimate JE Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY),

291

particularly relevant for use in cost-effectiveness analyses for introduction of vaccination into new

292

locations.

293

Since JE vaccination does not produce herd immunity, the transmission intensity can only be reduced by

294

influencing the animal transmission cycle. Previous attempts to break the transmission cycle have been

295

vector control and vaccination in pigs and wading birds, and this has been considered in modelling work

296

(Khan et al. 2014). However they were either ineffective or up to now have been deemed economically

297

and logistically intensive (Fischer et al. 2008). Further work considering pig vaccination in the context of

298

these updated estimates of the burden of JE should be considered. We estimate that despite not

299

interrupting transmission, human vaccination can be an effective strategy to reduce JE case numbers. This

300

can be seen from the estimate that the majority of the reduction in global burden is due to the routine

301

vaccination program in China from 2008. We estimate that India, East Timor, and Vietnam also have high

302

transmission intensity, and residual cases despite vaccination, and therefore could further benefit from

303

scaling-up the existing vaccination program. We estimated high transmission intensity in Indonesia,

304

Papua New Guinea, and Philippines where there are no current vaccination programs, suggesting that

305

vaccination in these areas should be a future priority. Future smaller scale estimates will support decisions

306

on where within these countries could be best targeted for vaccination. For areas with a long history of JE

307

vaccination such as South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Taiwan, (Fig 4), we estimate a substantial

308

vaccine impact (Fig 5), though with cases still occurring. In other countries with a long vaccination

309

history however, we estimate a minimal impact of vaccination (Fig 4 and 5), due to low estimated

310

transmission intensity in Japan, low vaccine coverage in Malaysia, or both in Australia (though age-

311

stratified data was not available in Australia). Our estimate of transmission intensity for Japan also has

312

great uncertainty, as half the studies included data pre-2000 and we were able to find limited information

313

on the long-running vaccination program there. Further work with serological data and further exploration

314

of the drivers of JE transmission will help refine this estimate.

315

Assessing JE disease burden and vaccination program performance is important though difficult due of

316

the lack solid surveillance programs worldwide. In our paper, we are able to estimate the disease burden

317

and vaccine impact using a modelling method that is able to overcome some of the limitations of current

318

surveillance. We estimate annually there are still 100,000 cases of this severe, but preventable disease, in

319

Asia. The majority of remaining cases are focused in countries with still developing healthcare systems

320

therefore vaccination should be a priority. The results generated from this study will help guide Gavi and

321

other international and national public health agencies in deciding on when and where to direct their

322

future investment into JE vaccination.

Methods

324

Systematic review

325

We performed a systematic review to find all available age-stratified case data for Japanese encephalitis

326

in PubMed. We used the search terms “epidemiology” or “incidence” or “prevalence” or “public health”

327

or “surveillance” or “distribution” in all fields with “Japanese encephalitis” in the title or abstract. All

328

titles and abstracts were screened and we selected those in which the study contained age-stratified case

329

data. We retrieved the full-texts for these selected abstracts and the abstracts were read by two

330

independent reviewers to extract the age-stratified case data. From each study we also collected other

331

information about the catchment areas, sample collection methods, diagnosis tests, and regional

332

vaccination programs from the papers. A final consensus was reached for the final list of eligible full-

333

texts. If abstracts were not available, the two independent individuals also tried to access and examine the

334

full-texts. We also searched online for age-stratified case data from national JE surveillance reports.

335

We obtained vaccination information either from the study itself or from the literature review. Based on

336

the review of JE vaccination programs reported from the World Health Organization (WHO)

337

(Heffelfinger et al. 2017), we found that previous vaccination programs had occurred in 13 countries. We

338

then undertook a literature search to find all vaccination information (target age group, vaccine coverage,

339

types of vaccine used, years of vaccination) for these countries. We also collated historical routine

340

vaccination program from country reported administrative doses data time series (from 2000 to 2015)

341

compiled from WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting (World Heath Organization 2018) and additional data

342

from Gavi.

343

Force of infection estimation

344

Force of infection (FOI) is the per capita rate at which susceptible individuals are infected by an

345

infectious disease. In this study, we used a basic Muench’s catalytic model (Muench 1958) to estimate the

346

constant age and time independent FOI using the case data we extracted during the systematic review

347

process. A similar approach has been used to estimate the global dengue transmission intensity (Imai et al.

348

2016; Rodriguez-Barraquer, Salje, and Cummings 2019). As humans are dead-end hosts for JE, the FOI

349

represents the FOI from the animal reservoir, and therefore is not impacted by human vaccination. This

350

means vaccination can be included in the model simply as a removal of susceptible individuals by

351

vaccination (or a reduction in risk of infection in this vaccinated group depending on vaccine efficacy)

352

and will not alter the FOI. Therefore in this model, individuals can become immune to infection either by

353

natural infection (depending on the force of infection) or vaccination.

Model convergence was assessed visually.

383

We assumed that the JE vaccine has 100% effectiveness, which is reasonable given the reported high

384

effectiveness of the vaccine ((WHO) 2012a, 2014, 2012b) and that the protection acquired from natural

385

infection or vaccination was life-long. We further assumed the age distribution of the population within

386

each country was homogenous across the country.

387

For our estimate, the endemic areas were defined to be the same as in the previous JE burden estimate

388

(Campbell et al. 2011). For China, India, Nepal and Indonesia, where transmission intensity is diverse

389

these countries were broken down to low, medium, or high endemic areas. In total, there are 30 endemic

390

areas, spanning 24 countries. We inferred the FOI for each endemic area based on the FOI estimated from

391

collated studies. The inference was based on two rules: 1) For each area, the FOI was obtained by

392

sampling from the estimated FOI of all the studies that had catchment areas within that endemic area (if

393

any). 2) For endemic areas in which no studies were conducted, the FOI was inferred to be equal to the

FOI of the area in the same incidence group defined by (Campbell et al. 2011).
