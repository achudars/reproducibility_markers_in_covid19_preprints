ABSTRACT

Rationale: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is an established risk factor for cerebrovascular disease
but the mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Disentangling the causal effects of
T2D, hyperglycemia, and pre-diabetic phenotypes (insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction) on major
etiological stroke subtypes (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke subtypes)
could inform the development of preventive strategies.
Objective: We employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the effects of genetic
predisposition to T2D, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction on risk of stroke
subtypes and related cerebrovascular phenotypes.
Methods and Results: We selected instruments for genetic predisposition to T2D, HbA1c levels,
fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction (proxied by pro-insulin levels) based
on published genome-wide association studies (up to 898,130 individuals). Applying two-sample
MR, we examined associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke
subtypes (large artery, cardioembolic, small vessel stroke; up to 60,341 cases and 454,450 controls).
We further explored associations with the related phenotypes of carotid atherosclerosis, imaging
markers of cerebral white matter integrity, and brain atrophy. Genetic predisposition to T2D and
elevated HbA1c levels in the pre-diabetic range were associated with higher risk of any ischemic
stroke, large artery stroke, carotid plaque and small vessel stroke. Independently of HbA1c levels,
we further found genetic predisposition to insulin resistance to be associated with large artery and
small vessel stroke, whereas predisposition to β-cell dysfunction was associated with small vessel
stroke. Predisposition to β-cell dysfunction was further associated with intracerebral hemorrhage,
lower grey matter volume, and total brain volume.
Conclusions: This study supports causal effects of T2D and hyperglycemia on large artery and small
vessel stroke. We show differential effects of genetically determined insulin resistance and β-cell
dysfunction on large artery and small vessel stroke that might have implications for anti-diabetic
treatments targeting these mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION
Cerebrovascular disease is a major public health issue1 ranking as the second leading cause of
mortality and adult disability worldwide.2, 3 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is an established risk
factor for cerebrovascular disease.4, 5 In cohort studies, T2D shows associations with higher risk for
both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke independently of other risk factors.6 Also, several studies
found associations of measures of hyperglycemia (glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose
levels) with risk of stroke, both in patients with and without diabetes.6, 7 However, large-scale
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing intensive glucose-lowering in patients with T2D show
no significant reductions in risk of stroke, possibly due to insufficient power.8-11 Moreover, the
effects of T2D or hyperglycemia on etiological stroke subtypes (large artery stroke, cardioembolic
stroke, small vessel stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage) remain elusive.
Currently available anti-diabetic medications act by either directly lowering glucose levels or by
targeting two major mechanisms that contribute to hyperglycemia: insulin resistance or pancreatic βcell dysfunction.12, 13 Observational data suggest that markers of insulin resistance, β-cell
dysfunction, and hyperglycemia influence the risk of cardiovascular disease independently of each
other.14, 15 However, data on stroke and its etiological subtypes are lacking. Moreover, there is a risk
of confounding in observational studies. Developing targeted strategies for stroke prevention in
patients at risk or suffering from T2D would require disentangling these relationships.
Mendelian randomization (MR) may help to clarify these associations. MR uses genetic variants as
instruments for traits of interest and is not prone to confounding and reverse causation.16 As such,
MR has proven to be a powerful methodology for inferring causality.17, 18 The availability of largescale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with detailed phenotyping of cases further enables
the exploration of etiological stroke subtypes that are typically not considered in epidemiological
studies.
Here, we leveraged data from large-scale GWASs and performed MR analyses, with the following
aims: (i) to examine the effects of genetic predisposition to T2D on risk of ischemic stroke, ischemic
stroke subtypes, and intracerebral hemorrhage; (ii) to explore the effects of genetically determined

measures of hyperglycemia (HbA1c and fasting glucose levels) among diabetes-free individuals on
these phenotypes; (iii) to disentangle the associations of genetic predisposition to insulin resistance,

β-cell dysfunction, and hyperglycemia with major stroke etiologies; and (iv) to explore associations
between diabetic traits and related vascular phenotypes including carotid atherosclerosis,
neuroimaging markers of white mater integrity, and brain atrophy.

METHODS

Study design and data sources
This is a two-sample MR study following the guidelines for strengthening the reporting of
Mendelian randomization studies (STROBE-MR).19 The data sources that we used are detailed in
Table 1. The study is based on publicly available summary statistics from GWAS consortia. Our
study design and the phenotypes explored in these analyses are depicted in Figure 1. We explored
associations of genetic predisposition to T2D, measures of hyperglycemia (HbA1c and fasting
glucose levels), as well as markers of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction with cerebrovascular
disease phenotypes including stroke subtypes, carotid atherosclerosis, white matter (WM) integrity,
and brain atrophy. Information on all genetic variants used as instruments in the current study are
presented in Supplementary Tables S1-S6.

Genetic instrument selection
Diabetes mellitus type 2. We selected genetic instruments from the latest GWAS meta-analysis for
T2D based on 74,124 cases and 824,006 controls of European ancestry from 32 studies included in
the DIAGRAM consortium.20 The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and population structure. We
selected as genetic instruments all the 403 distinct genetic variants showing significant associations
with T2D in this meta-analysis (either genome-wide significance at p<5x10-8 or independent locuswide significance at p<10-5 at significant loci; Supplementary Table S1). In sensitivity analyses, we
restricted our genetic instruments to those reaching genome-wide significance.

Hyperglycemia. We selected genetic instruments for HbA1c levels (per 1%-increment) based on a
GWAS that we performed on 408,989 diabetes-free individuals of White British ancestry in the UK
Biobank (UKB).21 We excluded individuals with self-reported history of physician-diagnosed
diabetes, use of oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin, HbA1c level >6.5%, or random glucose levels
>200 mg/dl. We adjusted for age, sex, genotyping platform array, assessment center, and the first 20
principal components of the population structure and performed the analyses using BOLT-LMM
with correction for relatedness and subtle population stratification. For fasting glucose levels (per 1SD increment), we used the most recent GWAS meta-analysis (adjusted only for age, sex, and
population structure) by the MAGIC consortium on 133,010 diabetes-free individuals of European
ancestry.22 For both HbA1c and fasting glucose, we selected as instruments genetic variants reaching
genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8) after pruning for linkage disequilibrium at an r2<0.01
threshold. We identified 543 instruments for HbA1c levels and 21 for fasting glucose levels
(Supplementary Tables S2-S3).22
As several genetic variants may influence HbA1c levels through effects on erythrocyte biology and
not by inducing hyperglycemia,23 to isolate the effects of the hyperglycemia-related genetic
component of HbA1c levels, we performed sensitivity analyses excluding those variants reported to
be associated at p<0.001 with erythrocyte-related traits in Phenoscanner24 (hemoglobin
concentration, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular
hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red cell distribution width, reticulocyte
count, reticulocyte fraction of red cells, immature fraction of reticulocytes, high light scatter
percentage of red cells, high light scatter reticulocyte count).
Insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. As instruments for insulin resistance we used 53 genetic
variants identified in a multi-trait GWAS to associate with all three components of this phenotype
(fasting insulin levels, triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol; Supplementary Table S4).25 We
weighted the instruments based on their effects on fasting insulin levels (per 1-log increment) in a
GWAS meta-analysis of 108,557 diabetes-free European individuals.22 In accordance with existing
literature, we proxied β-cell dysfunction based on fasting proinsulin levels (per 1 log-increment).26-28

We used summary statistics from a GWAS meta-analysis of 16,378 diabetes-free European
individuals and identified 21 genetic instruments (at p<5x10-8 and r2<0.01; Supplementary Table
S5).26 The GWAS for fasting insulin levels was adjusted for age, sex, and population structure,22
whereas the GWAS for pro-insulin was additionally adjusted for fasting insulin levels.26
We further used T2D-associated genetic variants previously grouped into clusters of diabetic
endophenotypes; three clusters of insulin resistance (related to obesity, fat distribution, or lipid
metabolism) and two clusters of β-cell dysfunction both associated with reduced levels of fasting
insulin, but with opposing effects on fasting proinsulin.29 We used the clusters of the variants and the
respective weights per variant and cluster, as described in the study by Udler et al. (Supplementary
Table S6). 30

Proportion of explained variance and instrument strength
For all genetic variants used as instruments, we estimated the proportion of explained variance for
the respective phenotypes (Supplementary Tables S1-S5). We estimated the variance explained by
each genetic variant for T2D based on the method by So et al. for binary phenotypes31 and for the
continuous traits we used a previously described formula based on summary statistics.32 For the
estimations regarding T2D, we used a prevalence rate of 8.5%, according to the 2015 estimate of the
global prevalence of the disease by the International Diabetes Federation.33 We then calculated the Fstatistic as an indicator of instrument strength.34 In sensitivity analyses, we restricted our selection to
variants with F>10, which is widely considered to indicate instruments with very low probability for
weak instrument bias.34

Associations with outcomes
We then examined associations of the selected instruments with ischemic stroke, ischemic stroke
subtypes, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) as the primary outcomes of interest. For ischemic
stroke, we used summary GWAS data from the MEGASTROKE trans-ethnic population, mainly

consisting of European individuals (70%).35, 36 We extracted summary GWAS statistics for any
ischemic stroke (60,341 cases, 451,210 controls) and for the major ischemic stroke subtypes
according to the TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification:37 large artery
stroke (6,688 cases, 238,513 controls), cardioembolic stroke (9,006 cases, 352,852 controls), and
small vessel stroke (11,710 cases, 287,067 controls). GWAS data for ICH were derived from the
International Stroke Genetics Consortium (ISGC) GWAS meta-analysis including 1,545 cases and
1,481 controls of European ancestry.38
Presence of carotid plaque, markers of WM tract integrity (WM hyperintensities (WMH) volume,
mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy), and markers of brain atrophy (grey matter volume, total
brain volume) were explored as secondary outcomes. Carotid plaque data were derived from a
GWAS meta-analysis (21,540 cases, 26,894 controls of European ancestry) from the CHARGE
consortium.39 For the imaging phenotypes (WMH volume, mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy,
grey matter volume, total brain volume), we undertook GWAS analyses in the UK Biobank
neuroimaging dataset including 17,534 individuals of White British ancestry based on the MRI
sequences, as has been previously described.40 We performed linear regression analyses (additive
models) for ln-transformed WMH volume, the first principal components of all measurements of
mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy across the different white matter tracts in the diffusion
sequences, and for normalized grey matter and total brain volumes. Adjustments were made for age,
sex, mean resting and task functional MRI head motion, the genotype platform array, and the first 10
principal components of the population structure.

Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed in R (v3.5.0; The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) using the
MendelianRandomization, TwoSampleMR, and the MR-PRESSO packages.
Main analyses. We applied two-sample MR using association estimates derived from the
abovementioned sources. Following extraction of the SNP-specific association estimates between the
instruments and the outcomes, and harmonization of the direction of estimates by effect alleles, we

computed MR estimates for each instrument with the Wald estimator.41 We calculated standard
errors with the Delta method. We then pooled individual MR estimates using random-effects
inverse-variance weighted (IVW) meta-analyses.41 For the main analyses, we corrected for multiple
comparisons with the false discovery rate (FDR) approach and set statistical significance at qvalue<0.05. Associations not reaching this threshold, but showing an unadjusted p<0.05 were
considered of nominal significance.
Assessment of pleiotropy and sensitivity analyses. MR estimates derived from the IVW approach
could be biased in the presence of directional horizontal pleiotropy. As a measure of overall
pleiotropy, we assessed heterogeneity across the SNP-specific MR estimates in the IVW MR
analyses with the Cochran’s Q statistic (statistical significance set at p<0.05).42 We further applied
alternative MR methods which are more robust to pleiotropic variants. The weighted median
estimator allows the use of invalid instruments as long as at least half of the instruments used in the
MR analysis are valid.43 The MR-Egger regression allows for the estimation of an intercept term that
can be used as an indicator of unbalanced directional pleiotropy.44 MR-Egger provides less precise
estimates and relies on the assumption that the strengths of potential pleiotropic instruments are
independent of their direct associations with the outcome.44 The intercept obtained from MR-Egger
regression was used as a measure of unbalanced pleiotropy (p<0.05 indicated significance).44 Finally,
MR-PRESSO regresses the SNP-outcome estimates against the SNP-exposure estimates to test for
outlier SNPs.45 Outliers are detected by sequentially removing all variants from the analyses and
comparing the residual sum of squares as a global measure of heterogeneity (p<0.05 for detecting
outliers); outliers are then removed and outlier-corrected estimates are provided.45 MR-PRESSO still
relies on the assumption that at least half of the variants are valid instruments.45
Mediation analyses and multivariable Mendelian randomization. We additionally performed MRbased network mediation analyses46 to examine the extent to which increases in HbA1c levels
mediated the effects of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction on stroke subtypes. We performed
this analysis only for large artery and small vessel stroke, for which we found robust evidence of
associations with HbA1c. We calculated the total effects of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction

on the outcomes of interest using random-effects IVW MR analyses. For the direct effects, we
combined the instruments for insulin resistance or β-cell dysfunction with those for HbA1c levels
and performed multivariable MR analyses for their associations with the stroke subtypes.47 To
calculate the indirect effects, we calculated the difference between the direct and the total effect
estimates.48 We finally estimated the proportion of the overall effect of insulin resistance or β-cell
dysfunction on stroke subtypes that was mediated through increases in HbA1C by dividing the
indirect by the total effects.48 Standard errors were derived using the delta method.

RESULTS
The 403 genetic variants used as genetic instruments for T2D explained 17.2% of the variance in
T2D prevalence (Supplementary Table S1), whereas variants used as instruments for the
continuous hyperglycemia traits, insulin resistance (proxied by fasting insulin levels), and β-cell
dysfunction (proxied by fasting proinsulin), explained lower proportions of variance: 1.9% for
HbA1c, 1.5% for fasting glucose, 0.7% for insulin resistance, and 4.5% for β-cell dysfunction
(Supplementary Tables S1-S5).

Genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk of stroke
In the primary IVW MR analyses, genetic predisposition to T2D (1-log-increment=2.72-fold higher
odds) was significantly associated with a higher risk of any ischemic stroke (OR: 1.10, 95%CI: 1.071.12), large artery stroke (OR: 1.19, 95%CI: 1.14-1.26), and small vessel stroke (OR: 1.14, 95%CI:
1.10-1.19; Figure 2). In addition, there was an association of nominal significance with higher risk
of cardioembolic stroke (OR: 1.05, 95%CI: 1.01-1.09). All SNPs used as insturments for genetic
predisposition to T2D had F-statitics >10, thus indicating a very low probability of weak instrument
bias. In sensitivity analyses restricted to SNPs reaching genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8) for
association with T2D the results remained stable and statistically significant and we further found an
association of nominal significance with ICH (Supplementary Table S7).

With the exception of ICH, there was evidence of significant heterogeneity in all of the main
analyses (p<0.05; Supplementary Table S8), but no evidence of unbalanced pleiotropy, as assessed
by the Egger intercept p-values (all p>0.05; Supplementary Table S7). Across sensitivity analyses
based on alternative MR methods (weighted median, MR-Egger, outlier-corrected MR-PRESSO), all
effects remained directionally consistent and all estimates stable with p<0.05 for any ischemic
stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke (Supplementary Table S7).

Genetic predisposition to measures of hyperglycemia and risk of stroke
In analyses of hyperglycemia traits we found that genetically determined HbA1c levels (per 1%increment) among diabetes-free individuals were significantly associated with risk of any ischemic
stroke (OR: 1.28, 95%CI: 1.12-1.46), large artery stroke (OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.22-2.13), and small
vessel stroke (OR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.45-1.33; Figure 3). In contrast, we found no significant
associations between genetically determined fasting glucose levels and risk of stroke subtypes
(Figure 3).
There was evidence of heterogeneity in the analyses for HbA1c levels (Supplementary Table S8)
and in MR-Egger the effect estimates for any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel
stroke were smaller (Supplementary Table S7). However, in sensitivity analyses that excluded
SNPs influencing HbA1c levels through erythrocyte-related traits, the association estimates were
even larger (ischemic stroke, OR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.30-1.98; large artery stroke, OR: 2.05, 95%CI:
1.29-3.26; small vessel stroke, OR: 2.44, 95%CI: 1.64-3.65) and there was no evidence of
heterogeneity (all p>0.10). Similarly, the results remained stable, when excluding SNPs with an Fstatistic <10 that might introduce weak instrument bias in the analyses.

Genetic predisposition to insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and risk of stroke
We next selected genetic variants as instruments for insulin resistance and β -cell dysfunction, the
two primary underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of hyperglycemia and T2D.

Among diabetes-free individuals, we found genetic predisposition to insulin resistance (1-log
increment in fasting insulin levels) to be associated with a higher risk for ischemic stroke (OR: 1.33,
95%CI: 1.13-1.57), large artery stroke (OR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.12-2.31), and small vessel stroke (OR:
1.63, 95%CI: 1.21-2.20; Figure 4A). Genetic predisposition to β-cell dysfunction (1-log increment
in fasting proinsulin levels) was further associated with a higher risk for both small vessel stroke
(OR: 1.38, 95%CI: 1.17-1.63) and ICH (OR: 1.75, 95%CI: 1.21-2.52). There was no heterogeneity in
these analyses (Supplementary Table S8) and the results were consistent in alternative MR analyses
(Supplementary Table S7).
To gain additional insights in the relationship between insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and
etiological stroke subtypes, we further explored the effects of T2D-associated variants clustered in five
different mechanisms of action. These included three clusters for insulin resistance (mediated by
obesity, fat distribution, lipid metabolism) and two clusters related to β-cell dysfunction (associated
with high or low proinsulin). In multivariable analyses including all clusters and also adjusting for
their effects on HbA1c, we found significant effects of genetic predisposition to β-cell dysfunction
related to high proinsulin on risk of ischemic stroke and small vessel stroke (Figure 4B). We further
found genetic predisposition to insulin resistance mediated through altered fat distribution to be
associated with higher risk of small vessel stroke. Genetic predisposition to insulin resistance mediated
through obesity showed associations of nominal significance with large artery and cardioembolic
stroke.
We next explored whether the effects of genetic predisposition to insulin resistance and β-cell
dysfunction on large artery and small vessel stroke are mediated through hyperglycemia (Figure 5).
Genetic predisposition to insulin resistance was associated with higher risk of large artery stroke
independently of its effects on HbA1c; the indirect effect through increases in HbA1c levels was not
significant. For small vessel stroke, we found genetic predisposition to both insulin resistance and βcell dysfunction to contribute to a higher risk independently of HbA1c levels; again, the indirect
effects through HbA1c were not significant. HbA1c was associated with a higher risk of large artery
and small vessel stroke, independently of insulin resistance or β -cell dysfunction (Figure 5).

Genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes and glycemis traits and associations with etiologically
related cerebrovascular phenotypes
Table 2 presents the MR associations of genetic predisposition to T2D, measures of hyperglycemia,
insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction, with carotid plaque, as well as with neuroimaging traits
related to white matter integrity and brain atrophy. Genetic predisposition to T2D and genetically
elevated HbA1c levels were associated with carotid plaque. We further found a significant
association between genetic predisposition to T2D and lower fractional anisotropy, a diffusion
imaging marker of impaired white matter tract integrity, as well as nominally significant associations
with lower grey matter and total brain volumes (Table 2). Genetic predisposition to β-cell
dysfunction (1-log increment in fasting proinsulin levels) was further associated with lower grey
matter volume (beta: -0.13, 95%CI: -0.20 to -0.07) and total brain volume (beta: -0.17, 95%CI: -0.23
to -0.11; Table 2). These results remained stable in sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table S7).

DISCUSSION
Levaraging large-scale GWAS data in MR analyses, we investigated the causal associations between
T2D, glycemic traits, and cerebrovascular disease. We found genetic predisposition to T2D and
hyperglycemia (elevated HbA1c levels) to be associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke,
particularly large artery and small vessel stroke. Independently of hyperglycemia, genetic
predisposition to insulin resistance but not β-cell dysfunction was associated with higher risk of large
artery stroke, whereas genetic predisposition to both insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction was
associated with small vessel stroke. Genetic determinats for T2D and hyperglycemia further showed
significant effects on carotid plaque and fractional anisotropy, a WM neuroimaging marker related to
cerebral small vessel disease. Conversely, genetic predisposition to β-cell dysfunction was associated
with intracerebral hemorrhage and neuroimaging markers of brain atrophy.
Our MR results provide genetic evidence for a causal effect of T2D, and also hyperglycemia in the
non-diabetic range, on risk of ischemic stroke. While T2D is among the established risk factors for

stroke and vascular disease in general,5 primary prevention trials focusing on intensive glucose
control or specific oral anti-diabetic agents showed inconsistent effects on stroke risk.8-11 Previous
Mendelian randomization studies were underpowered to detect effects of hyperglycemia (HbA1c or
fasting glucose levels) on stroke risk.49, 50 Here, by using data from >400,000 individuals from the
UK Biobank, we were able to show that genetically elevated HbA1c levels are associated with a
higher risk of ischemic stroke, thus suggesting that preventive strategies focusing on long-term
HbA1c-lowering will result in risk reductions for ischemic stroke. The lack of significant effects in
previous trials might relate to insufficient power due to the low number of incident stroke events,
short follow-up periods, and differences in the efficacy profiles of the individual treatments.51
We found the effects of genetic predisposition to T2D and hyperglycemia to be specific for large
artery and small vessel stroke. In accordance with these results, we found genetic predisposition to
T2D to be associated with carotid plaque, an atherosclerotic phenotype, and fractional anisotropy, a
marker of WM integrity associated with small vessel disease. Thus, our findings provide evidence
for a causal involvement of T2D and hyperglycemia in both large artery atherosclerosis and cerebral
small vessel disease. On the contrary, we found no significant effects of T2D or other diabetic traits
on cardioembolic stroke. Differences in the magnitude of the effects between stroke subtypes might
in part explain the heterogeneity in the effects of glucose-lowering treatments across previous
clinical trials.51 On the basis of our findings, future trials testing glucose-lowering approaches should
account for stroke subtypes.
As another major finding, we show that genetic predisposition to insulin resistance and β-cell
dysfunction influences the risk of stroke independently of hyperglycemia. This could have clinical
implications for oral anti-diabetic medications. While all anti-diabetic agents lower glucose levels,
some drug classes primarily target insulin sensitivity whereas others primarily target β-cell
function.12, 13 Our findings indicate that the mechanism of action might have relevance for stroke
prevention on top of the glucose-lowering effects. This could further provide another layer of
explanation for the heterogeneous effects of existing clinical trials testing different anti-diabetic
medications for stroke prevention.52

Interestingly, we also found differential effects of genetic predispostion to insulin resistance and βcell dysfunction on risk of stroke subtypes and related phenotypes. Genetic predisposition to insulin
resistance showed effects on both large artery and small vessel stroke indicating more widespread
effects on cerebral circulation similar to those of hyperglycemia. In contrast, genetic predisposition
to β-cell dysfunction was associated with small vessel stroke, intracereral hemorrhage, and brain
atrophy, which are all manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease.53 Given the lack of specific
preventive strategies for cerebral small vessel disease, our MR results are of great interest and
suggest that strategies targeting β-cell dysfunction should be explored in future studies.
Our study has several methodological strengths. The large sample size (898,130 individuals for
diabetic traits and up to 514,791 individuals for stroke) and nature of our datasets provided the power
to detect differential effects of diabetes on etiological stroke subtypes and to perform multiple
sensitivity analyses for testing the validity of the MR assumptions, thus minimizing the possibility of
biased results. While the genetic determinants of HbA1c might influence its levels via both
erythrocyte and glycemic biology, we provided support for the latter, as the effects were stronger
when focusing on variants not associated with erythrocyte traits. Incorporating insulin resistance and

β-cell dysfunction on top of hyperglycemia in the analyses offered deeper insights into the
pathophysiological mechanisms linking diabetes with the different stroke subtypes. Finally, the
exploration of additional cerebrovascular disease traits enabled us to triangulate our findings for
stroke subtypes by showing similar associations for etiologically related phenotypes.
Our study also has limitations. First, by design MR examines the effects of lifetime exposure to the
traits of interest, which might differ from the effects of clinical interventions (e.g. glucose-lowering
approaches) applied for shorter time periods later in life. Second, it was only possible to use proxies
for the genetic predisposition to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. However, available
GWASs for biomarkers more closely related to these phenotypes (e.g. the homeostatic model
assessment indexes for insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction) were underpowered, thus
precluding the identification of valid genetic instruments.54 Third, the MR analyses for insulin
resistance were weighted based on the effects of the genetic variants on fasting insulin adjusting for

BMI and the analyses for β-cell dysfunction based on the effects of the variants on fasting proinsulin adjusting for fasting insulin. These adjustments in the original GWASs might increase the
risk for collider bias in MR analyses,55 which should be considered when interpreting our findings.
Fourth, despite using the largest currently available GWAS datasets, our analyses for some of the
etiologically related traits remain underpowered. Finally, our analyses were primarily based on
datasets involving individuals of European ancestry and might thus not be applicable to other
ethnicities.
In conclusion, our results suggest causal associations of T2D and hyperglycemia with a higher risk
for ischemic stroke, particularly large artery and small vessel stroke. Against findings from
secondary analyses of clinical trials, our results support that therapeutic approaches aimed at
lowering HbA1c have the potential to decrease the risk of ischemic stroke. The effects of genetically
determined insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction on large artery and small vessel stroke observed
here might have implications for anti-diabetic treatments specifically targeting these mechanisms.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of our study design and assumptions of Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. The assumptions of the MR study
design include the following: the genetic variants (instruments) must be associated with the exposure (assumption 1); the variants must not be associated with
confounders (assumption 2); the variants must influence the outcome only through the risk factor under study (assumption 3).
