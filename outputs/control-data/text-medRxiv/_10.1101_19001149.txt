Abstract
Purpose: This study examines the association between aerobic capacity and biomarkers of skeletaland cardiac muscle damage among amateur triathletes after a full distance Ironman.
Methods: Men and women (N=55) were recruited from local sport clubs. One month before an Ironman triathlon, they conducted a 20m shuttle run test to determine aerobic capacity. Blood samples
were taken immediately after finishing the triathlon, and analyzed for biomarkers of cardiac- and skeletal muscle damage. Regression models examining the association between aerobic capacity expressed
in both relative terms (mLO2*kg-1*min-1) and absolute terms (LO2*min-1) controlled for weight and
were fitted.
Result: A total of 39 subjects (26% females) had complete data and were included in the analysis. No
association between aerobic capacity and cardiac muscle damage but a significant negative association
between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage was observed. This association was independent
of how aerobic capacity was expressed, although the model with aerobic capacity expressed in absolute
terms and controlled for weight resulted in slightly higher r2 values, than when aerobic capacity was
expressed in relative terms.
Conclusion: A negative association between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage was seen
but despite the well-known cardio-protective health effect of high aerobic fitness no such association
could be observed in this study.

Introduction

bic capacity and the most commonly used is
oxygen uptake expressed per body weight, i.e.
mLO2*kg−1 *min−1 . However, expressing aerobic
capacity relative to body weight also implies a proportional relationship between the two variables; if
there is no such relationship the ratio becomes invalid [10]. Expressing aerobic capacity as a ratio
complicates any interpretation of which of the two
variables, or if the ratio itself, correlates with the
outcome. Entering the two variables that make up
the ratio, i.e. oxygen consumption (LO2*min−1 )
and weight (kg), as separate variables when performing statistical analyses is suggested as a solution to overcome the ratio problem [11]. In this
study we examined the association between aerobic
capacity and skeletal- and cardiac muscle damage
after a full distance Ironman in a sample of amateur
triathletes. Aerobic capacity was expressed both
relative to kg body weight (mLO2*kg−1 *min−1 ),
as well as in absolute terms (LO2*min−1 ) corrected
for weight, in order to see if one is a better predictor
than the other.

Ultra-endurance races such as the the Ironman
triathlon (3.8 km swimming, 180 km cycling and
42.2 km running) has been on the rise since the
mid-1980s and the proportion of women participating is currently around 15 % [1]. Even though
physical activity in general has positive health effects, ultra-endurance races, such as an Ironman
triathlon, lead to a rise in biomarkers of skeletaland cardiac muscle damage [2]. However, most of
the previous studies in the area have been conducted on elite athletes and the physiological responses to such performances may not be applicable to less trained, amateur athletes. For example, we have previously shown that both female
and male amateur athletes have elevated cardiac
troponin T (cTnT) well above the clinical reference limit for myocardial infarction after a Ironman
triathlon [2] and that another marker for myocardial damage, cardiac specific myosin heavy chain α
(MHC-α) follows a two peaked increase post-race
[3]. However, the magnitude of the changes were
greater in our sample compared to other studies on
elite athletes [4]. Moreover, we were unable to explain the variation of the skeletal and cardiac muscle damage with our models, which included sex,
age, body composition and finishing time (r2 values ranged from 0-22 %).
In order to better understand the health implications of the damage observed after ultra-endurance
races, and to identify strategies for prevention, it is
important to find variables that improve the model
of skeletal- and cardiac muscle damage prediction.
In this regard, maximum aerobic capacity is an
interesting candidate since it has been well documented that having a high aerobic capacity is protective against cardiovascular disease in the general
population [5]. In addition, the physiological factors that leads to high aerobic capacity could also
protect the athlete from cardiac and skeletal muscle damage. For instance, higher aerobic capacity
has been linked to left ventricular [6] and cardiac
myocyte 6 adaptations that might minimise cardiac
muscle damage. Higher aerobic capacity should in
theory also limit skeletal muscle damage since it is
correlated to training volume [7] and intensity [8],
which lead to structural adaptations that increase
the skeletal muscles’ tolerance to stress [9].
There are several ways of expressing aero-

Methods
Study sample
In all, 55 subjects, who had signed up to participate
in an Ironman triathlon in Kalmar, Sweden, were
recruited from local sport clubs associated with the
Swedish Triathlon Federation. Because our sample
was not selected at random, there is a risk of selection bias and therefore, we tested for differences
regarding age and finishing time from the overall
population of Ironman participants (i.e. average
obtained from 41,000 finishers). There were no significant differences in either age (p=0.590, one sample t-test) or finishing time (p=0.780, one sample ttest) between our sample and the overall Ironmanpopulation.

Ethical considerations
This study received ethical approval from the
regional ethical committee in Linköping (Dnr
2016/86-31). Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Procedure

Statistics

Approximately one month prior to the Ironman
triathlon, all subjects were invited to conduct a
20m shuttle run test to estimate their aerobic capacity. In total, 42 subjects performed the test.
On the same occasion, the subjects were measured
for weight and percentage of body fat (%BF) using
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) on a Tanita
BC-545 Body Composition Analyzer (Tanita, Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan). Height was measured on a SECA
217 stadiometer (SECA medical measurements and
scales, Hamburg, Germany).
One week before and within 15 minutes after
the race, blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein by registered nurses. The samples
were transferred to the local hospital to be analysed within two hours of being drawn, with the
exception of MHC-α which was stored at -80◦ C
and analysed within two months after the race was
finished. As markers of skeletal muscle damage,
the blood samples were analysed for creatine kinase
(CK; ref. < 1.9 µkat/L) and myoglobin (MG; ref.
<72 µg/L). Cardiac muscle damage was analysed
using cardiac troponin T (cTnT; ref. < 14 ng/L)
and the novel marker MHC-α (no available reference values) MHC-α is occurring predominantly in
atrial muscle but as well in ventricular muscle [12].
N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; ref. < 300 ng/L) was analysed
as a marker for cardiac volume overload. Levels of
myoglobin cTnT and NT-proBNP were analyzed
using an electrochemiluminiscience immunoassay
on automated analyzers (Cobas e411, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). CK was
analyzed using the multiple-point dry chemistry
method (Vitros 5.1 FS Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Johnson-Jonson
Company, Rochester, USA). The laboratory methods used were standard hospital procedures and
were analysed at a laboratory accredited according
to Sweden´s national accreditation body, Swedac
(www.swedac.se). MHC-α concentration was measured with a commercially available ELISA (CloudClone, Houston, Texas, USA) with no reported
cross reactivity with other myosins. The biomarkers were chosen because they are commonly used
in clinical practice, they are based on recommendations for sports medicine [13] and they allow for
comparison with previous research in the field.

All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 24. Descriptive data are presented as mean
± standard deviation (SD) or as median an 25th 75th percentile for highly skewed variables. We performed a drop-out analysis in which we investigated
if there were any differences in baseline characteristics between those with and without data on aerobic capacity. In the drop-out analysis, independent
samples t-test were conducted. In order to examine the potential influence on aerobic capacity on
skeletal- and cardiac muscle damage, we created
two sets of models, one in which aerobic capacity is
expressed relative to weight (mLO2*kg−1 *min−1 )
and one in which aerobic capacity is expressed in
absolute terms (LO2*min−1 ). Both sets were analysed in both crude and adjusted analyses. The adjusted models were adjusted for baseline values of
the biomarkers, sex, %BF and age of the participants. When aerobic capacity, in absolute terms,
was analysed we also entered weight in the model.
Furthermore, in the adjusted analyses, a stepwise
regression with two steps was fitted. This was done
to investigate the independent contribution of aerobic capacity on the dependent variables, i.e. the
change in the adjusted values of coefficient of determination (r2 ). Despite several of the variables
being correlated with each other, no sign of severe
multicollinearity was observed in any of the models
(all variance inflation factors < 5). If the assumption of heteroscedasticity of the residuals was not
satisfied, the dependent variables were log transformed.

Results
In total, 39 finished the race and provided baseline data. On average they had trained for 11.2±3
hours/week and had finished a median (25th-75th
percentile) 8 (3-19) ultra-endurance races prior
to this one. The descriptive data and baseline
biomarker levels stratified for sex is presented in
table 1. There were no differences between those
with or without baseline assessment data in any of
the variables shown in table 1 (all p>0.05).
In the unadjusted analyses,

(mLO2*kg−1 *min−1 ) and both biomarkers

cantly to the model predicting skeletal muscle

from 0.026 to 0.210 (F: 8.927, p=0.005) and for CK
the adjusted r2 increased from -0.015 to 0.267 (F:

A similar picture regarding the independent association between aerobic capacity and the biomarkers was seen when aerobic capacity was entered
in absolute terms (LO2*min−1 ) in the models (table 4). For myoglobin, the explained variance increased significantly from an adjusted r2 value of
0.07 to 0.227 (F: 10.386, p=0.003) and for CK from
an adjusted 2 value of -0.029 to 0.281 (F: 15.215,
p<0.001) when adding aerobic capacity to the models.

Discussion

damage could therefore be seen as indirect evidence
that aerobic capacity actually is protective of cardiac damage if the required time and power output
is constant. A better predictor for cardiac damage could be the relative intensity, i.e the working
heartrate divided by the maximum heartrate which
is a commonly used variable to describe intensity
and load in endurance athletes. The importance of
relative intensity as a predictor of cardiac damage
is strengthen by the fact that higher intensity but
for shorter duration leads to a greater cTnT release
[18]. Measurement of the athletes working and
maximal heartrates should therefore be included in
future research. Another factor that should be considered for future research is the indirect measure of
aerobic capacity. The 20m shuttle-run is provides
reasonably good estimates of aerobic capacity [19]
and is a useful field test since several subjects can
be tested simultaneously at a low cost. However,
it includes a lot of anaerobic accelerations and decelerations that might become a limiting factor for
ultra-endurance adapted athletes. This may have
affected the accuracy of the models in this study.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between aerobic capacity and biomarkers of skeletal and cardiac muscle damage after a
full distance Ironman in amateur athletes. We observed that increased aerobic capacity was associated with decreased skeletal muscle damage, while
no evidence was found for an association with cardiac muscle damage. These relationships were independent of how aerobic capacity was expressed.

Cardiac muscle damage
The absence of an association between aerobic capacity and markers for cardiac muscle damage was
surprising given the well know cardio-protective
health effects of having a high aerobic fitness. We
have previously reported that nearly all of the athletes showed pathological values of cTnT (98%) and
NT-proBNP (89%) after finishing the race [3] but
the clinical value of these observations are under
debate. The debate centers on whether the elevated biomarkers seen after ultra-endurance races
reflect true pathological changes or if they are a
part of the normal physiological response [14, 15].
Given that cTnT leaks into the bloodstream even
after rather modest efforts such as after one hour of
spinning [16] it might reflect myocyte stress rather
than damage in a non-pathological population. For
this reason, we included the novel marker MHC-α.
While cTnT is a small molecule (37 kDa), this is
much larger (224 kDa) and an increase after exercise could hardly be explained by passage through
an intact cardiac cell membrane or as a normal
physiological response. However, as a diagnostic
marker, MHC-α has not been thoroughly studied
and there are no, with modern technology, established reference values.
One possible explanation for the lack of association between aerobic capacity and cardiac muscle damage may be that subjects with high aerobic capacity exercise at higher aerobic power outputs. Higher aerobic power outputs demand higher
cardiac outputs, which leads to increased cardiac
stress. In fact, the rate of perceived exertion is a
reliable predictor of training stress [17] which implicates that athletes automatically adapt the aerobic
output to the aerobic capacity. The lack of positive
association between aerobic capacity and cardiac

Skeletal muscle damage
The association between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage observed in this study could
be due to several factors. Having a higher aerobic capacity is correlated to training volume [7]
and intensity [8], which leads to structural adaptations that increase the skeletal muscles? tolerance
to stress [9]. Another aspect that has been linked
to skeletal muscle damage, is eccentric (breaking)
muscle actions [20]. Eccentric muscle action occurs during running, but not during swimming or
cycling. In this context, the inter-individual difference in running economy may be the most interesting factor in explaining why we observe a
negative association between aerobic capacity and
skeletal muscle damage post-race. Running economy is defined as the energy demand for a given
velocity of submaximal running and is influenced
by several factors, including ground reaction forces,
muscle-tendon properties [21] and body weight [22].
Therefore, those with lower aerobic capacity may
also have a poorer running economy, i.e., too much
movement in the vertical direction. This results
in higher ground reaction forces [23] with a subsequent increase in eccentric muscle actions and

Strengths and limitations

more knee-joint-movement that may lead to skeletal muscle damage. The potential associations between aerobic capacity, running economy and skeletal muscle damage are further supported by the associations between markers of skeletal muscle damage and body weight (table 4) that were seen in this
study. Quantifying the ground reaction force during a race could be done by equipping the athletes
with accelerometers which have been shown to be
able to measure ground reaction forces [24].

In this study, the 20m shuttle-run was used to
quantify the aerobic capacity of the triathletes.
This is not a direct measure of aerobic capacity,
which may have affected the accuracy of the models. However, it provides reasonably good estimates
of aerobic capacity [19] and is a useful field test
since several subjects can be tested simultaneously
at a low cost. In contrast to most of the previous
research in this field, we have included sample that
is representative of the general participants and a
relatively large proportion of women. This makes
the results more relevant in a health context and
increases the generalisability of our findings. The
major limitation is that our study is an observational study, which limits our ability to draw conclusions regarding causal effects

Expressing aerobic capacity
In this study, we used two different approaches to
analyse the association between aerobic capacity
and the biomarkers. This was done out of concern
that entering a ratio, in our case aerobic capacity expressed relative to body weight, in the model
could be problematic for two reasons. Firstly, the
ratio itself may be biased and could cause spurious
associations between the ratio and the health related outcomes to be observed 10,11. Conversely, a
ratio may obscure the true relationship between itself and the health related outcomes. This has been
proven by Kronmal, who showed that for another
kg
commonly used ratio, the body mass index ( m
2 ),
the ratio could appear unrelated to the health related outcomes, even though one or both of the
variables making up the ratio was related to the
same outcomes [25]. In our study, the two sets of
adjusted regression models showed similar results,
but they were not identical. In the models where
aerobic capacity was expressed in absolute terms a
negative association with the biomarkers for skeletal muscle was seen in combination with a positive association between weight and the biomarkers. In theory, this could lead to a situation in
which the two variables would be cancelling each
other out if they were combined to form a ratio.
This was not the case in our study where aerobic capacity, independently of how it was expressed, was
negatively associated with skeletal muscle damage.
However, the adjusted r2 -values were higher for the
models with aerobic capacity expressed in absolute
terms compared to relative terms, even if this difference was small indicating that a slightly clearer
picture of the relationship between aerobic capacity and health related outcomes after a full distance
Ironman-triathlon emerged.

Practical application
The growing interest in ultra-endurance events warrants more research into the potential short and
long-term health consequences of participating in
such races. Most of the literature to date has focused on the acute changes in different biomarkers
but information about underlying factors associated with those changes is scarce. In this study, we
examined if aerobic capacity predicted the magnitude of cardiac- and skeletal muscle damage postrace. As we found no such association with cardiac muscle damage, our findings indicate that predictors of this remain to be identified. This is
important information given the debate whether
a marathon, triathlon or ultra-running repeatedly
harms the heart by causing heart muscle cell necrosis. There is only circumstantial evidence on both
sides of the debate of physiological versus pathological explanations of cTnT leakage. Neither side can
so far conclusively prove what the mechanism of
cTnT rise really is. On the one hand, it seems counterintuitive that just exercise should be the one and
only scenario where increased plasma cTnT levels
are not associated with increased risk of adverse
outcomes. In all other situations even a subclinical
rise of cTnT indicates a higher incidence of subsequent coronary heart disease, heart failure and
death [26]. On the other hand, it seems equally
unlikely that elite distance runners who maintain
a high fitness over decades would have repeatedly

sustained small myocardial infarctions [27]. Further studies using a longitudinal study design is
needed to resolve this debate. To avoid excessive
skeletal muscle damage, having a high aerobic capacity is beneficial, possibly linked to structural
adaptations of the muscle-tendon unit associated
with a higher training dose or with a better running economy.

Conclusion
Aerobic capacity, independently of how it was expressed, was negatively associated with biomarkers for skeletal muscle damage after an Ironman
triathlon, but not with biomarkers for cardiac muscle damage. To identify predictors of cardiac muscle damage, future studies could test other predictors, included more potential confounders or analyse more specific biomarkers, or include measures
taken during the race if possible. The long term
health effects of ultra-endurance races is an area or
research which needs further attention.
