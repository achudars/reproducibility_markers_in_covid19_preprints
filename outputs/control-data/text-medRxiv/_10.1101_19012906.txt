ABSTRACT
Objectives – To assess the causal relationship of different health conditions in childhood and

adolescence with educational attainment and school absence.

Design – Longitudinal observational study and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.
Setting – Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population sample of children

from South-West England born in 1991-1992.

Participants – 6113 unrelated children with available GCSE records and genetic data (50% female).
Exposures – Six common health conditions with known genetic markers measured at age 10

(primary school) and 13 (mid-secondary school). These were: symptoms of Attention-Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), depression, asthma, migraines and
BMI. Genetic liability for these conditions and BMI was indexed by polygenic scores.
Main outcome measures – Educational attainment at age 16 (total GCSE and equivalents points

score), school absence at age 14-16.

Results – In multivariate-adjusted observational models, all health conditions except asthma and

migraines were associated with poorer educational attainment and greater school absence.
Substantial mediation by school absence was seen for BMI (e.g. 35.6% for BMI at 13) and migraines
(67% at age 10), with more modest mediation for behavioural and neurodevelopmental measures of
health. In genetic models, a unit increase in genetically instrumented BMI z-score at age 10
predicted a 0.19 S.D. decrease (95% CI: -0.28 to -0.11) in attainment at 16, equivalent to around a
1/3 grade difference in each subject. It also predicted 8.6% more school absence (95% CI:1.3%,
16.5%). Similar associations were seen for BMI at age 13. Consistent with previous work, genetic
liability for ADHD predicted lower educational attainment, but did not clearly increase school
absence.
Conclusions – Triangulation across multiple approaches supported a causal, negative influence of

higher BMI on educational attainment and school absence. Further research is required to
understand the mechanisms linking higher BMI with school absence and attainment.

What is already known on this topic
•
•
•

On average, children with common health conditions have worse educational attainment
It is unclear whether all health-attainment and health-absenteeism associations are causal,
or reflect confounding by social and economic circumstances
We do not know how much health-related school absenteeism contributes to these
associations

What this study adds
•
•
•
•

Results support a negative influence of high BMI in secondary school on educational
attainment (GCSEs) and absenteeism
Absenteeism substantially mediated BMI-GCSE associations, suggesting a target for
intervention
There was less evidence for causal effects of Autism Spectrum Disorder, depressive
symptoms, asthma or migraines on attainment and absenteeism
Contribution of absenteeism to ADHD-GCSE associations was modest, suggesting
interventions should target other mechanisms

INTRODUCTION

Good health in childhood is positively associated with later socioeconomic outcomes including
educational attainment (1-3), but the extent to which associations are causal is unclear. Health in
childhood also shows consistent social patterning by family background, with worse health for less
advantaged groups(4). This implies that health may play a key role in intergenerational transmission
of socioeconomic (dis)advantage(5), suggesting an avenue for potential intervention(4). It also
brings challenges for identification of causal mechanisms linking health to socioeconomic outcomes
over the life-course(6), as socioeconomic circumstances in childhood may influence both attainment
and health independently. This paper focuses on the impact of child and adolescent health on
educational attainment: an aspect of socioeconomic position usually established in early adulthood,
with extensive evidence of protective effects for later health(7).
Childhood and adolescent health encompasses behavioural, emotional and physical aspects, across
which both the size of effect on educational outcomes and the pathways involved may differ(8). For
example, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is related to lower educational
attainment(9-11), with mixed evidence for depressive symptoms (12-17). There is marked variability
in academic ability observed for children with Autism Spectum Disorder (ASD)(18, 19). Evidence is
mixed for the effect on attainment of body weight(20-26), asthma(27-31) and rarer health
conditions(27-29, 32, 33). School absence may play a role in the link between health and education
but its contribution likely differs by condition(34-36). Migraine(30, 37) and depression appear linked
to school absence(38), but evidence is mixed for asthma(27, 31, 35), ADHD (28, 39), ASD(28, 40) and
obesity(41-44). Retrospective reporting of absence by children or parents(45) means estimates from
previous studies may be affected by recall bias and measurement error(31).
Relationships of health, school absence and educational attainment are vulnerable to confounding.
For instance, associations of obesity with social disadvantage(46) and poorer psychological
health(47) may confound BMI-attainment associations(23), since disadvantage and poor
psychological health may influence weight and attainment independently. Reverse causation may
exaggerate associations with mental health(17). Approaches have been developed to circumvent
these problems by using genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) associated with
health conditions as proxies or instrumental variables. Since SNPs are assigned at conception,
associations with SNPs cannot be due to reverse causation or classical kinds of confounding(48).
Such studies support a causal influence of ADHD on educational attainment(9, 49), but report
inconclusive effects for BMI(25, 26) Results for ASD have been null(49), or pointed to effect
heterogeneity, with a positive relationship between ASD and attainment for high-functioning
subgroups(50). Fewer studies have examined depression with null results reported(51). These
genetic methods have not yet been applied to the influence of asthma or migraines on attainment.
.

To further understand these relationships, we applied a range of genetic methods to compare the
impact of six aspects of childhood and adolescent health on educational attainment: ADHD, ASD,
depressive symptoms, BMI, asthma, and migraines. Causality was explored in several ways. In an
English birth cohort(52), we assessed associations of attainment with polygenic scores representing
genetic liability for health conditions, and used polygenic scores as instrumental variables (onesample Mendelian randomization). We explore mediation of associations by school absence and
avoid the recall bias likely to have affected previous studies by using linked records for absence and
educational attainment. We consider health in late primary school (approximately age 10) and midsecondary school (approximately age 13), to examine whether influence of health on attainment
varies with age. Finally, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization for the same
conditions and educational attainment in independent adult samples.

METHODS
One and two-sample Mendelian Randomization

To overcome confounding and reverse causality, a range of approaches have been developed which
use genetic variants (typically SNPs) associated with health. Multiple SNPs associated with a health
condition can be combined into a polygenic risk score (PGS) representing genetic liability for a
condition. Relative to single SNPs, this improves statistical power by explaining more variation in a
health exposure of interest. In one-sample Mendelian randomization, an effect size for the causal
influence of the exposure is estimated by using the PGS as an instrumental variable for the exposure
in a two-stage least-squares model. Two-sample Mendelian randomization, in contrast, requires only
summary-level results from genome-wide association studies(GWAS)(53). This compares
associations of individual SNPs with an exposure (here, a health condition) on one hand and an
outcome (here, educational attainment) on the other. If the exposure-outcome relationship is
causal, the same SNPs should associate with both.
Study participants

Individual-level data was obtained from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC), a birth cohort of children born in the south-west of England with estimated birth dates
between April 1991 and December 1992. Inclusions and exclusions for this analysis are shown in
Supplementary Figure 1. The total ALSPAC sample comprised 15,454 pregnancies, with 14,901
children alive at 12 months. Questionnaire and clinic data were obtained from mothers and children
from pregnancy onwards, with detailed description given elsewhere(52, 54). After excluding related
individuals, there were 7856 unrelated ALSPAC participants with genetic data, of whom 6113 had
GCSE records. Multiple imputation with chained equations (m=50) was used to impute missing
health measures (Supplementary Table 1), absences and covariates.
Measures

Health in childhood and adolescence
ADHD symptoms were based on the hyperactivity subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ-HI), as completed by mothers, when children were aged 9 and 13. The SDQ is a
validated screening tool for psychiatric disorders in the relevant age group(55). Depressive
symptoms were measured using the short-form Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ)(56)
completed by children at ages 10 and 13. For autism, the parent-reported Social Communication
Disorder Checklist (SCDC) at ages 10 and 13 was used to derive a continuous measure of autistic
social traits (57). BMI (in kg/m2) was based on measured height and weight from clinic assessments
at ages 10 and 13. From this, measures were standardized to the 1990 UK Growth Reference
according to gender and age. Resulting z-scores, representing S.D. difference from the reference
mean, were included in models as continuous variables. Presence of asthma in the past 12 months
was defined using mother’s reports of diagnoses, medication use and wheezing symptoms, at ages
10 and 13 At age 10, mothers were asked if their children had experienced migraine, from which a
binary indicator was derived. A later measure of migraine was not available. Please note that the
study website contains details of all the data that is available through a fully searchable data
dictionary and variable search tool: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/

Educational attainment, school absence, and covariates

Information on educational attainment and school absences came from linkage to the National Pupil
Database (NPD). We consider educational outcomes at the end of year 11 (end of Key Stage 4), when
most participants were aged 16 and which marked the end of compulsory education in the UK at the
time. In all analyses, standard errors were clustered by school. We used the total GSCE and
equivalents points score, based on a pupil’s best 8 GCSE or equivalent subjects. This is a continuous
measure ranging from 0 to 540. One grade difference in one GCSE subject equates to 6 points, such
that 5 grade Cs is worth 200 points and 8 A*s worth 464. A small number of scores above 464 reflect
pupils who took AS levels early. More information is available from the Department of
Education(58). School absence data was available for the academic years 2006-7 through 2008-9,
corresponding to different school years for participants enrolled in ALSPAC (birth dates span 21
months). Records covered early September until the end of May. Information on absences was
therefore available across the sample on absences in year 11, for the majority of participants on
absences in year 10, but only for a minority in year 9 (Supplementary Table S1). We therefore
considered school absence during the two years of key stage 4 (years 10 and 11), by imputing each
separately and calculating an average post-imputation.
Polygenic scores
ALSPAC children were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 platform, and standard quality
control procedures applied. Individuals were excluded for gender mismatches, minimal or excessive
heterozygosity, disproportionate individual missingness (>3%) and insufficient sample replication
(IBD<0.8). Individuals with non-European ancestry were removed. SNPs with a minor allele
frequency of <1%, call rate of < 95% or evidence of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (p-value<5×10-7)
were removed. Cryptic relatedness was measured as proportion of identity by descent (IBD>0.1).
Imputation was performed using Impute v2.2.2 to the 1000Genomes reference panel, and SNPs with
poor imputation quality (infoscore<0.08) removed.
GWAS were used to identify SNPs associated with ADHD, ASD, depression, asthma and migraine, and
with BMI. We obtained SNP associations for ADHD(59), depression(51), ASD(50), asthma(60) and
migraine(61) from GWAS including child and adult-onset conditions, since GWAS specifically of childonset conditions were unavailable. For BMI, we used genetic variants associated with adult BMI
from the most recent and largest BMI GWAS(62). A GWAS of BMI in children exists, but ALSPAC
comprised a substantial component of the discovery sample(63), and such sample overlap can cause
bias (64). When choosing SNPs to include in the polygenic scores, the conventional threshold of
genome-wide significance of p<5×10-8 was applied, except for ASD. As too few SNPs meet that
threshold to permit meaningful analysis, a more liberal threshold of p<5×10-7 was used. Within the
set of SNPs which were available in ALSPAC and had passed standard quality control, we removed
SNPs which were not independent (linkage disequilibrium clumping threshold r2=0.01,
distance=10,000kb). Polygenic scores were calculated in PLINK 1.9 by summing each individual’s
number of trait-increasing alleles. These were weighted by the regression coefficient for the allele’s
association with the trait from the relevant GWAS – so that genetic variants with greater effects
contributed more to the scores – and then standardized. Details of the GWAS and SNPs used are
provided in Supplementary Figure 1, and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.
Statistical analysis

Analyses in ALSPAC
Analyses were conducted using STATAv15. The proportion of school sessions missed ranged from 0
to 0.79 (Table 1, Supplementary Table S4) with considerable skew, so for analysis was log-

gender-specific reference mean. fAbsences were analysed as the number of half-day sessions recorded as
missed, divided by the number of sessions on which data was available. For most participants, data was
available each year for between 280 and 320 sessions, not the 390 of a standard school year, as records cover
early September until the end of May. A small minority (2.3% in year 10, 4.8% in year 11) had data
corresponding to fewer sessions. gMainstream state schools: community, voluntary controlled or aided,
foundation, city technology college, academy. Other schools: community special, pupil referral unit, further
education college
transformed after adding a constant of 0.01. Coefficients for absence are therefore expressed in
terms of percentage change. For each aspect of health at age 10 and 13, linear regression was used
to examine associations with GCSE points score and with logged school absence. All analyses were
adjusted for gender and a number of potential confounders relating to family socioeconomic
circumstances at birth: maternal age (in years) and parity, maternal education (from highest
qualification, classified as none, CSE, vocational qualifications, O-level, A-level, or university degree),
maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), and maternal housing tenure (owner-occupier/council
rented/private or housing association rented/other). Sensitivity analyses stratified by school type,
restricting in turn to children attending mainstream state schools, independent (fee-paying) and
other schools (community special schools, pupil referral units, further education colleges). Mediation
analysis using STATA’s paramed package considered associations of health with GCSE points score
via school absence (the indirect effect) and unexplained by school absence (the direct effect).
Models were run separately within each imputed dataset and estimates combined across
imputations.
Linear regression was used to examine associations between each of the polygenic scores with GCSE
points score and with school absence. Genetic models were adjusted only for gender and 20
principal ancestry components. With a valid instrument, adjustment for confounders of
observational associations is not necessary, and can introduce bias if those factors were not included
in the GWAS used as the source of the gene variant-exposure associations(65). Where there was
evidence of an association and the polygenic scores were shown to be sufficiently strong
instruments (first-stage F-statistics >10), one-sample MR analyses were run using each of the
polygenic scores as an instrument for the corresponding measured health condition at age 10 and
13. A concern in MR studies is pleiotropy, which can bias exposure-outcome causal estimates. This is
when alleles related to the exposure (e.g. BMI) influence the outcome (e.g. GCSEs) via pathways
other than through the exposure. Validity of instruments was checked using Stata’s MRRobust
package. This applies two-sample MR methodology to the SNPs included in each PGS, producing MRmedian, MR-modal and MR-Egger estimates(66).
Summary-level Mendelian Randomization
Using the TwoSampleMR package in R(67), summary-level MR analyses were performed to assess
the causal effect of asthma, migraine and BMI on educational attainment. SNPs associated with
educational attainment came from the most recent GWAS of years of schooling in Europeanancestry individuals(68), except for BMI where an earlier education GWAS was used (69) to avoid
sample overlap which could bias results. Details of the GWAS used MR are given in Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2.

RESULTS
Socioeconomic background, GCSEs, and school absence

GCSEs scores and school absences varied by gender and by child’s socioeconomic background
(Supplementary Table S5). Girls’ GCSE capped points scores were on average higher than boys: 345.6
(95% CI: 338.7, 352.5) compared to 319 (95%CI: 311.0, 327.1), but school absence was also slightly
higher for girls: 7.8% (95%CI: 7.1%, 8.4%) compared to 7.1% (95% CI: 6.6%, 7.7%) for boys. Maternal
education was positively associated with attainment, and negatively associated with school absence.
Children whose mothers had a degree had an average GCSE point score of 393.2 (95% CI: 387.2,
399.1) and average school absence of 6.0% (95% CI: 4.6%, 7.4%). For children whose mothers had a
Certificate of Secondary Education or no qualifications, average GCSE points score was 275.6 (95%
CI:266.9, 284.4) and average school absence 9.8% (95% CI: 9.0%,10.7%). As expected, GCSE points
scores were negatively associated with school absence. For example, adjusted for gender, an
increase in absence corresponding to an extra day/year at key stage 4 was associated with -2.7 (3.3,-2.0) fewer GCSE points.
Phenotypic models: health, GCSEs and school absence

In phenotypic models (Figure 1, Table 2), all aspects of child and adolescent health were associated
with GCSE points score except for migraines and asthma. All were associated with school absence
(Figure 2, Table 3). Depressive symptoms at age 10 showed a considerably stronger association with
GCSEs than depressive symptoms at 13 (GCSE points scores: -14.75; 95% CI: -17.45, -12.06 compared
to -5.39; 95% CI: -7.93, -2.85 per SD MFQ score). Otherwise, associations did not differ substantially
by age. In mediation analyses, associations between all aspects of health and educational attainment
were mediated by school absence expect for asthma, where indirect and total effects went in
opposite directions at age 10, and indirect and direct effects in opposite directions at 13 (Figure 3,
Supplementary Table S6). Percent of associations mediated by absence varied, with the lowest for
ADHD (6.1% at age 10, 7.9% at 13) and the highest for BMI (48.5% at age 10, 35.7% at 13) and
migraine (67.4% at age 10). (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S4). Results were similar restricting to
participants in mainstream state schools. For other school types, small numbers of participants led
to imprecise estimates (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).

Genetic models: health, GCSEs and school absence

Predictive power of the polygenic scores varied considerably by health condition. The proportion of
variance explained by the scores (R2 or pseudo-R2 for binary exposures) was 7.4% and 7.7% for BMI
at 10-11 and 13, respectively, but less than 1% for migraine and asthma, and less than 0.1% for
ADHD, ASD and depressive symptoms (Supplementary table S9). Tests for instrument strength
(Supplementary Table S7) confirmed the BMI PGS could be used to instrument BMI z-scores, but the
other PGSs could not be used as instruments.
For ADHD and BMI, higher values of the polygenic scores predicted lower GCSE points (Table 4,
Figure 4). Specifically, each SD increase in the genetic liability for ADHD corresponded to a decrease
of 2.70 (95% CI: -4.83, -0.58) GCSE points. A one SD increase in the BMI genetic score corresponded
to a decrease of 5.37 (95% CI: -7.78, -2.96) GCSE points and a 2.70% (95% CI: 0.58%,4.86%) increase
in school absence. Using the polygenic score for BMI as an instrumental variable showed that, for
each unit increase in BMI z-score at age 10, GCSE points scores were 17.01 lower (95% CI: -24.76,9.28) and absences were 8.60% greater (95% CI:1.27%, 16.47%). For each unit increase in age- and
gender-standardized BMI at age 13, GCSE points scores were 16.12 lower (95% CI: -23.43, -8.81) and
absences were 8.13% greater (95% CI: 1.22%, 15.52%).

Results were similar restricting to participants in mainstream state schools, while small numbers of
participants again led to imprecise estimates for other school types (Supplementary Table S10).
Tests of instrument validity applying two-sample methodology in ALSPAC (Supplementary Table S11)
were consistent with main results, and there was no evidence of bias due to pleiotropy for
associations with GCSEs. There was evidence of pleiotropy for effect of BMI on absenteeism (MREgger intercept 0.004, p=0.02), but additional SNP-specific checks(70) could not identify particular
SNPs responsible (Supplementary Table S12). Results did not differ using a BMI PGS excluding 24
SNPs identified as outliers in Two-Sample MR (Supplementary Table S13).
Results of two-sample MR analyses using published GWAS for educational attainment (years of
schooling) were broadly consistent with results from ALSPAC (Table 5). Previous two-sample MR
analysis reported evidence of an effect of ADHD(49) but not ASD(49) or depression(51). Our analyses
supported an influence of BMI, with a one-unit increase in BMI associated with 0.16 (p<0.001) and
0.11 (p<0.001) fewer years of schooling in IVW and weighted median models respectively. These
models also support a negative influence of asthma on years of schooling (-0.02, p<0.001 and -0.02,
p=0.01 respectively). There was little evidence of a causal impact of migraine. For BMI, the MR-Egger
constant (-0.002, p<0.001) indicated an influence of pleiotropy. Outliers were therefore identified by
comparing SNP-specific estimates with the overall IVW estimate, and analyses repeated with these
SNPs excluded. This did not change conclusions (supplementary table S14). We also checked
associations of these SNPs with other phenotypes but none stood out as clear confounders
(supplementary table S14).

DISCUSSION

In phenotypic analysis, all aspects of adverse health at ages 10 and 13 predicted greater school
absences between age 14 and 16, and all aspects of adverse health except asthma and migraines
predicted lower educational attainment at 16. Lack of associations of asthma and migraine with
GCSEs may reflect binary measures unable to capture the full range of symptoms, or
misclassification of these exposures as diagnosis can occur later. However, these associations are
vulnerable to reverse causation and residual confounding by family- and individual-level
characteristics not captured by covariates. In line with previous work in ALSPAC(9), polygenic scores
representing genetic liability for ADHD were associated with worse GCSEs, but they were not
associated with greater school absence. Polygenic scores for higher BMI were associated with both.
Models using the PGS to instrument BMI supported these findings, and results shown to be robust to
exclusion of outlier SNPs identified from Two-Sample MR. MR analyses using ALSPAC found some
evidence of pleiotropy in BMI-absenteeism associations. However, we could not identify individually
pleiotropic SNPs. SNP-specific estimates were imprecise, and mechanisms should be explored in
samples large enough to investigate SNP-specific pathways more fully. Results from two-sample
summary-level Mendelian randomization also supports a negative causal impact of higher BMI on
educational attainment, despite the exposure and outcome being measured in individuals who were
considerably older than ALSPAC participants. Results indicate that, for BMI, associations with
attainment and absenteeism do not reflect only confounding. That IV coefficients were larger in
magnitude than OLS coefficients for the (negative) influence of BMI on GCSEs may point to an
offsetting mechanism causing suppression of effects in observational models. In UK children, both
thinness and obesity are associated with deprivation(71), and a nonlinear relationship between BMI
and socioeconomic hardship could lead to underestimation of the impact of high BMI on educational
attainment. IV estimates could also be inflated due to family-level processes, such as the influence of
parents’ genotype on offspring via environmental pathways(72) which may bias MR estimates based
on samples of unrelated individuals(73).
A key strength of this study is triangulation across several methodological approaches to investigate
if associations are causal. Negative associations of depressive symptoms at age 12(74), ADHD
symptoms in preschool(75) and obesity at 11 and 16 with GCSEs have been previously demonstrated
in the ALSPAC cohort(21). Our results support a causal interpretation of the latter two. They are
consistent with studies into educational impact of ADHD and depression using within-sibling
comparison (10, 12), which addresses confounding at the level of the family, but not confounding at
the level of the individual, such as by comorbidities. Two-sample MR suggested an influence of
asthma, as well as ADHD and BMI, on educational attainment. Although not apparent in ALSPAC, this
was observed in a recent study using UK Biobank participants, where genetically-instrumented

asthma corresponded to a 17% lower probability (CI:-25.3% to -8.7%) of holding a degree(76). Since
in the two-sample analysis educational attainment was measured in a substantially older
population(68), the discrepancy could reflect a cohort effect, with better treatment available to
younger cohorts, or asthma diagnoses made in adulthood.
A limitation concerns the relative strength of the genetic instruments, which was considerably
greater for BMI than other aspects of health. For ADHD, ASD and depression, the low proportion of
variance in the phenotype explained by the polygenic scores limited the degree to which genetic
methods could be meaningfully applied. For ASD, a more lenient threshold was required for SNPs
included in the PGS. Thus, results of genetic models for ASD and depressive symptoms should not be
interpreted as evidence of no effect. Rather, they indicate that associations may become clearer as
the genetics of these conditions becomes better understood. Migraine could only be examined at
age 10, but not 13, where effects may be greater. Recent evidence points to bias due to family-level
processes even in genetic studies of BMI(73). It is possible that such effects have influenced our
results, potentially overestimating BMI’s causal influence on attainment. Work in study populations
with genetic data on related family members will be required to investigate this further. ALSPAC is
not a national survey, and over-representation of more affluent groups and an under-representation
of non-White minority ethnic groups(52) may limit generalizability of findings. A major strength was
use of linked records for educational attainment and school absence, which meant associations were
not influenced by recall bias. Results of mediation analysis are consistent with a recent UK study(45)
reporting substantial mediation by parents’ reports of long-term absence (>1month) for any longterm health condition and a measure of mental health. Our findings indicate such results do not only
reflect recall bias, and add to current knowledge by also showing mediation by absence for high BMI.
A limitation is that information on absence was restricted to age 14-16, and absence earlier in
secondary school may also affect attainment. Mechanisms other than absenteeism linking health to
attainment are likely to be complex. For BMI, research has pointed to negative neurocognitive
correlates of obesity, but this largely cross-sectional literature has not established a causal
influence(77) and the evidence from longitudinal studies is much less clear(78). Socially-mediated
processes by which weight could influence educational outcomes involve weight bias by
teachers(79) and the impact of bullying by peers(80). Further work using both genetic and
qualitative approaches will be required to unpick these mechanisms.
Conclusion

In a UK-based cohort born in the early 1990s, our analyses supported a negative, causal influence of
high BMI on educational attainment and school absence. Mediation analysis supported substantial
mediation by absenteeism for BMI, and a smaller role for absenteeism in ADHD. The impact of
health on attainment was not fully explained, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the
social and biological mechanisms involved.
