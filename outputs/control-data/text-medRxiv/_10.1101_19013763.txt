ABSTRACT

51

Introduction

52

A major hurdle to HIV-1 eradication is the establishment of a latent viral reservoir early after

53

primary infection. Several factors are known to influence the HIV-1 reservoir size and decay

54

rate on suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART), but little is known about the role of human

55

genetic variation.

56

Methods

57

We measured the reservoir size at three time points over a median of 5.4 years, and searched

58

for associations between human genetic variation and two phenotypic readouts: the reservoir

59

size at the first time point and its decay rate over the study period. We assessed the contribution

60

of common genetic variants using genome-wide genotyping data from 797 patients with

61

European ancestry enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and searched for a potential impact

62

of rare variants and exonic copy number variants using exome sequencing data generated in a

63

subset of 194 study participants.

64

Results

65

Genome- and exome-wide analyses did not reveal any significant association with the size of

66

the HIV-1 reservoir or its decay rate on suppressive ART.

67

Conclusions

68

Our results point to a limited influence of human genetics on the size of the HIV-1 reservoir

69

and its long-term dynamics in successfully treated individuals.

INTRODUCTION

75

Combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) has turned the previously lethal infection by human

76

immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into a chronic disease. Despite this significant

77

achievement, HIV-1 as retrovirus, self-integrating its genome into the host chromosome,

78

persists indefinitely in infected individuals during treatment [1–4], and life-long ART is

79

required to control the infection.

80

A major hurdle to HIV-1 eradication is the establishment, already during primary infection, of

81

a latent viral reservoir of HIV-1 DNA persisting as provirus in resting memory CD4+ T cells

82

[1,2,5–8]. At the molecular level, chromatin remodeling, epigenetic modifications,

83

transcriptional interference, and availability of transcription factors have been considered as

84

possible mechanisms contributing to HIV-1 latency [9]. The viral reservoir is measurable

85

through different methods, including viral outgrowth assay and intracellular HIV-1 DNA

86

quantification [10,11]. Currently, there is no consensus on the best HIV-1 reservoir biomarker.

87

Total cell-associated HIV-1 DNA, easy to measure in different cell and tissue samples and

88

applicable to large populations, has been shown to be a good proxy for the reservoir size [12].

89

Indeed, while HIV-1 DNA measurement is able to detect both integrated and nonintegrated

90

viral genomes coding for intact or defective viruses [13], total HIV-1 DNA levels have been

91

shown to correlate with viral outgrowth [14], and to predict the time to viral rebound at

92

treatment interruption [15]. Moreover, the substantial loss of nonintegrated HIV-1 DNA

93

genomes following ART initiation suggests that total HIV-1 DNA after prolonged suppression

94

is largely accounted for by integrated viral genomes [16].

95

After an initial rapid decay following ART initiation, changes of the viral reservoir size over

96

time display wide inter-individual variability. By limiting dilution culture assay, the half-life of

97

the viral reservoir was first estimated to be 44 months (95% confidence interval 27.4-114.5) in

98

individuals with undetectable viremia [4]. A more recent study showed a slow decline of total

99

HIV-1 DNA with a half-life of 13 years after the first four years of suppressive ART [17].

100

Generally, different studies show a broad variability of the average decay rate, from 2.5 months

101

to no measurable decay [18–26]. One study even reported an increase in the viral reservoir size

102

in as much as 31% of patients in the 4-7 years following ART initiation [27], and recent data

103

from our group confirm this observation, reporting an increase in the reservoir size in 26.8% of

104

individuals in the 1.5-5.5 years after ART initiation [28].

105

Several factors are known to influence the decay rate of the viral reservoir: initiation of ART

106

during acute HIV-1 infection substantially accelerates the decay rate, while viral blips and low-

107

level viremia during ART slow it down, as shown in previous studies [22] and in recent data

108

from our cohort [28]. Conversely, treatment intensification, i.e. treating with additional drugs,

109

does not appear to influence the decay rate, suggesting that residual replication is not the main

110

driver of the viral reservoir [29] or that it may happen in sanctuary sites.

111

Human genetic variants have been shown to influence the outcome of various infections,

112

including HIV. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) addressed the role of

113

common genetic polymorphisms in several HIV-related phenotypes, including plasma viral

114

load (HIV-1 RNA) at set point, exceptional capacity to control viral replication, pace of CD4+

115

T lymphocyte decline, time to clinical AIDS, rapid progressor status or long-term non-

116

progressor status (LTNP) [30–37], and, in one single study, the amount of intracellular HIV-1

117

DNA, measured at a single time point during the chronic phase of infection [38]. Rare genetic

118

variants that are detectable through DNA sequencing technologies have been investigated far

119

less. However, a large exome sequencing study did not reveal any convincing association of

120

such variants with the natural history of HIV disease [39].

121

To date, no studies have addressed the role of human genetic variation in determining the initial

122

viral reservoir size and the reservoir decay rate over time. In the current study, we searched for

Ethics statement

129

Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) consented to the cohort study and genetic

130

analyses, as approved by the corresponding local Ethics Committees.

131
132

Study participants

133

The SHCS is an ongoing, nation-wide cohort study of HIV-positive individuals, including more

134

than 70% of all persons living with HIV in Switzerland. Clinical and laboratory information

135

has been prospectively recorded at follow-up visits every 3-6 months since 1988 [40]. The

136

general enrolment criteria have been described previously [28]. Additionally, availability of

137

genome-wide genotyping data from previous studies or of a DNA sample for genotyping was

138

required for inclusion in this study (Figure 1).

139
140

Quantification of total HIV-1 DNA

141

The collection of longitudinal cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

142

from eligible participants and the quantification of total HIV-1 DNA by droplet digital PCR has

143

been described previously along with the calculation of the reservoir decay rate [28]. Briefly,

144

this study utilized total HIV-1 DNA quantifications from three time points at a median of ~1.5

145

years, ~3.5 years, and ~5.4 years after initiation of ART.

148

Genome-wide genotyping data were obtained from previous GWAS that used various

149

microarrays, including the HumanCore-12, HumanHap550, Human610, Human1M and

150

Infinium CoreExome-24 BeadChips (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or generated from

151

DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the HumanOmniExpress-24

152

BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

153

Genotypes from each genotyping array were filtered and imputed separately, with variants first

154

flipped to the correct strand with BCFTOOLS (v1.8) according to the human GRCh37 reference

155

genome and filtered based on a less than 20% deviation from the 1000 genomes phase 3 EUR

156

reference panel. Genotypes were phased, and missing genotypes were imputed with EAGLE2

157

[41] and PBWT [42] respectively, using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 reference panel on

158

the Sanger Imputation Service [43]. Study participants were filtered based on European

159

ancestry as determined by principal component analysis (PCA) using EIGENSTRAT (v6.1.4)

160

[44] and the HapMap project [45] as reference populations (Figure S1A). Imputed variants were

161

filtered by minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%, missingness > 10%, deviation from Hardy-

162

Weinberg equilibrium (PHWE < 1e-6) and imputation quality score (INFO < 0.8). The remaining

163

genotypes were then combined using PLINK (v1.90b5) [46] prior to analyses.

164

To carry out the GWASs, genome-wide genotypes were tested for association with each of the

165

two study phenotypes (reservoir size or reservoir decay rate) in two separate genome-wide

166

association analyses. Statistical significance was set to the standard genome-wide significance

167

threshold of P < 5e-8 to correct for multiple testing. The associations were computed using

168

linear mixed models with genetic relationship matrixes calculated between pairs of individuals

169

according to the leave-one-chromosome-out method as implemented in GCTA mlma-loco

170

(v1.91.4beta) [47,48], only including age and sex as covariates, to avoid masking of true

171

associations by confounders. To further assess the contribution of variables previously shown

172

to be associated with either reservoir size or decay rate, we ran multiple genome-wide

173

association analyses, each including age, sex, and one single covariate, for each of the two study

174

phenotypes. Finally, we conducted a GWAS including all the covariates except those showing

175

mutual correlations. These covariates included time on ART, time to viral suppression,

176

infection stage (acute or chronic), HIV-1 RNA pre-ART, last CD4+ T cell count pre-ART,

177

HIV-1 subtype, transmission group, and occurrence of blips or low-level viremia during

178

treatment.

179

Classical HLA alleles at the four-digit level and variable amino acids within HLA proteins were

180

imputed using SNP2HLA (v1.03) with the T1DGC reference panel consisting of 5,225

181

individuals of European ancestry [49]. Association analyses with the imputed HLA alleles and

182

multi-allelic amino acids was performed using linear regressions in PLINK and multivariate

183

omnibus tests, respectively. For all HLA analyses age, sex and the first principal component

184

was included as covariates.

185

Genotypes at specific loci, i.e. the CCR5∆32 deletion (rs333) and the HLA-B*57:01 allele,

186

known to influence the setpoint viral load (spVL) [50,51], available from genome-wide

187

genotyping data, were tested for association with the reservoir size and its decay rate in 797

188

patients. High quality genotyping information on the CCR5∆32 deletion was available for most

189

individuals (N = 687), while all had available HLA information.

190
191

Exome sequencing and analysis

192

All coding exons were captured using either the Illumina Truseq 65 Mb enrichment kit

193

(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) or the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v1.0 (Integrated

194

DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA, USA) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq4000.

195

Sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37) including decoys with

196

BWA-MEM (v0.7.10) [52]. PCR duplicates were flagged using Picard tools (v2.18.14) and

197

variant calling performed using GATK (v3.7) [53].

198

To ensure a high-quality variant set across capture kit batches, all samples were merged and

199

variants filtered based on sequencing depth (DP ≥ 20) and genotype quality (GQ ≥ 30) using

200

BCFTOOLS (v1.8). Furthermore, individual genotypes were set as missing in cases of low

201

depth (DP < 10) or low quality (GQ < 20). The effect of the included variants was annotated

202

with SnpEff (v4.3T) [54].

203

For single variant association analysis, the VCF file was converted to PLINK format using

204

BCFTOOLS and PLINK. Only variants with a MAF above 5%, missingness per variant below

205

5% and absence of severe deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (PHWE > 1e-6) were

206

retained for the subsequent association analyses using PLINK. Sex, age and the first principal

207

component were included as covariates. Only individuals of European descent were retained

208

for the analyses, as determined by PCA (Figure S1B).

209

The combined effect of rare protein-altering variants (MAF < 5%), defined as either missense,

210

stop-gain, frameshift, essential splice variant or an indel by SnpEff, on the reservoir size and

211

decay rate was analyzed using optimal sequence kernel association tests (SKAT-O) [55]. For

212

the decay rate, individuals were split into two groups due to the non-normal distribution; one

213

exhibiting a very high decay over time (< -0.03 -log10(DNA)) and another with a stable

214

reservoir size (≥ -0.03 and ≤ 0.03 -log10(DNA)). For this case-control analysis we used the

215

SKATbinary function with linear weighted variants as implemented in the SKAT R package.

216

In both cases, the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and the first principal component.

217

Classical HLA class I and II alleles at the four-digit level were imputed from the exome

218

sequencing data using HLA*LA [56]. All reads mapping to the MHC region or marked as

219

unmapped were extracted using Samtools (v1.8) and used as input into HLA*LA. For

220

association analyses, the 4-digit HLA alleles were extracted and analyzed using PyHLA [57]

221

assuming an additive model, a minimum frequency of 5% and including age, sex and the first

222

principal component as covariates.

223
224

Copy number variation

225

Copy number variations (CNVs) were called from exome sequencing data using CLAMMS

226

[58]. CNVs were called for all samples in batches according to the exome capture kit used.

227

Within batches, samples were normalized based on coverage and potential intra-batch effects

228

adjusted for through the use of recommended mapping metrics extracted with Picard tools

229

(v2.18.14). After CNV calling, samples with the number of CNVs two times above the median

230

were excluded (N = 2). CNV association analyses were performed for duplications and

231

deletions separately for common CNVs (frequency > 5 %) with PLINK adjusting for age and

232

sex. Potential rare CNVs (frequency < 5%) impacting immune related genes were examined by

233

overlapping called CNVs with curated immune-related genes from Immport [59] which were

234

also listed as protein coding in GENCODE (v25).

235
236

Statistical analyses

237

All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical software (v3.5.2), unless

238

otherwise specified.

RESULTS

242

Host genetic determinants of the reservoir size and long-term dynamics

243

To investigate the effects of host genetic variation on the size of the HIV-1 reservoir 1.5 years

244

after ART initiation and its long-term dynamics under ART over a median duration of 5.4 years,

245

we performed a GWAS, including 797 well-characterized HIV-1 positive individuals. All study

246

participants were enrolled in the SHCS and were of European ancestry with longitudinal total

247

HIV-1 DNA measurements available (Table 1). The median HIV-1 reservoir size was 2.76

248

(IQR: 2.48-3.03) log10 total HIV-1 DNA copies/1 million genomic equivalents measured ~1.5

249

years after initiation of ART (Figure S2A). The median decay rate between 1.5-5.4 years after

250

initiation of ART was -0.06 (IQR: -0.12-0.00) log10 total HIV-1 DNA copies/1 million

251

genomic equivalents per year (Figure S2B). With our sample size we had 80% power to detect

252

variants with a MAF of 10% explaining at least 5% of the variance in HIV-1 reservoir size or

253

decay rate [60].

254

First, we performed GWAS using age and sex as covariates. We did not observe any genome-

255

wide significant variant (P < 5e-8) associated with either HIV-1 reservoir size or long-term

256

dynamics (Figure 2, S3). However, as we have previously determined, multiple factors are

257

associated with the HIV-1 reservoir size and its decay rate [28], some of which are correlated

258

(Figure S4). Thus, we performed additional analyses iteratively including these factors to test

259

whether they could mask genetic associations. We ran multiple GWAS each adjusting for age,

260

sex, plus one of the associated covariates, as well as all of the covariates together. The addition

261

of the covariates did not have any significant effect on the results nor the genome-wide inflation

262

factor (lambda) (Table S1).

263

Genetic variation in the HLA region has previously been associated with multiple HIV-related

264

outcomes, including spVL [51]. To test whether specific HLA variants were associated with

265

reservoir size or long-term dynamics, we imputed the HLA alleles and amino acids for all 797

266

individuals from the genotyping data. In line with the previous results, we did not observe any

267

genome-wide significant associations with any HLA allele or amino acid.

268
269

Impact of protein-coding and rare variants

270

To assess the impact of rare variants as well as protein-coding variants missed by genotyping

271

arrays on the HIV-1 reservoir size and long-term dynamics, we performed exome sequencing

272

in 194 of the 797 study participants. Patients were selected at the two extremes of the observed

273

reservoir decay rate: either very rapid, or absent (no change in reservoir size over ~5.4 years),

274

while individuals with increasing HIV-1 reservoir sizes were excluded (N=12). Thus, the long-

275

term dynamics phenotype was binarized for subsequent analyses of the decay rate, while the

276

HIV-1 reservoir size phenotype remained normally distributed (Figure S5).

277

To ensure that no common variants, missed by the genotype chips, were associated with the

278

HIV-1 reservoir size or long-term dynamics, we performed a GWAS for common variants using

279

age and sex as covariates. As with the genotyping data, we observed no genome-wide

280

significant variants for either phenotype (Figure S6).

281

We then examined the potential role of rare variants (MAF < 5%) with a functional impact

282

defined as either missense, frameshift, stop gained, splice acceptor or donor. Since HIV-1

283

primarily infects CD4+ T cells, we only included variants within genes expressed in these cells

284

as determined by Gutierrez-Arcelus et al. [61]. The significance threshold after correcting for

285

the number of tests performed was P = 1.21e-5. We did not observe any significant associations

286

for either the HIV-1 reservoir or the decay rate. The AMBRA1 gene showed the strongest

287

association with HIV-1 reservoir size (P = 4.15e-5, not significant) (Figure S7).

288

To confirm the lack of HLA association seen with the genotyping data, we imputed the HLA

289

haplotypes from the exome data using HLA*LA. Again, we did not observe any significant

290

HLA association with the study outcomes.

To examine the role of large exonic CNVs not captured by standard genotyping and exome

294

pipelines, we called CNVs from the mapped sequencing reads of the exome samples using the

295

software CLAMMS. The contribution of common CNVs to HIV-1 reservoir size and long-term

296

dynamics was analyzed by association analyses including age, sex and the first principal

297

component as covariates. No significant association was observed after Bonferroni correction

Influence of HLA-B*57:01 and the CCR5∆32 deletion on reservoir size and long-term

dynamics

303

We have previously shown that pre-ART RNA viral load levels are associated with the HIV-1

304

reservoir size and the occurrence of blips [28]. The HLA-B*57:01 allele and the CCR5∆32

305

deletion are well known genetic variants influencing HIV-1 spVL [50,51], and could thus also

306

be associated with the with the HIV-1 reservoir size or its decay rate. However, we did not

307

observe any nominal association (all P > 0.05) with either reservoir size or its long-term

308

dynamics for HLA-B*57:01 and CCR5∆32 (Figure S9).

DISCUSSION

312

We used a combination of genomic technologies to assess the potential role of human genetic

313

factors in determining both the HIV-1 reservoir size and its long-term dynamics in a well-

314

characterized, population-based cohort. We studied 797 HIV-1-positive individuals of

315

European origin under suppressive ART over a median of 5.4 years, for whom extensive clinical

316

data are available, allowing detailed characterization and correction for potential confounders

317

[28]. We measured the HIV-1 reservoir size at three time points and selected two phenotypes

318

for our genomic study: the reservoir size at ~1.5 years after ART initiation and the slope of the

319

reservoir decay rate calculated over the three time points. Previous HIV host genetic studies

320

mostly focused on phenotypes reflecting the natural history of HIV-1 infection, prior to ART

321

initiation, including spontaneous viral control and disease progression [30–37]. A single study

322

specifically tested for associations between common genetic variants and the amount of

323

intracellular HIV-1 DNA, measured at a single time point during the chronic phase of infection

324

prior to initiation of any antiretroviral therapy [38]. Here, in contrast, we longitudinally assessed

325

samples collected from patients under suppressive ART to search for human genetic

326

determinants of the long-term dynamics of the HIV-1 reservoir during treatment.

327

We first conducted a GWAS on 797 individuals to test for association between common genetic

328

variants and the phenotypes. Given the small proportion of non-European subjects in the initial

329

study cohort, we only included patients of European ancestry to avoid any false positive

330

associations or masking of true positive associations due to different allele frequencies in small

331

proportions of individuals belonging to different subpopulations (Figure 1) [62]. Regardless of

332

including or not independent covariates other than the standard ones (i.e., sex and age), no

333

genetic variant reached the genome-wide significance threshold for association with any of the

334

two phenotypes. This may reflect a small effect size of genetic variants on the HIV-1 reservoir

335

size and decay rate. We acknowledge that a larger sample size and thus increased statistical

336

power may allow detecting genetic variants with a smaller effect size associated with the

337

phenotypes. However, it should be noted that this study is by far the largest today that has

338

investigated the size and decay of the HIV-reservoir in well characterized and well suppressed

339

HIV-positive individuals over a longer time period. Alternatively, the control of the HIV-1

340

reservoir size and its long-term dynamics may be under the control of viral or host factors other

341

than the individual germline genetic background. A previous report from our group had shown

342

a correlation between viral blips during the first 1.5 years of suppressive ART and the HIV-1

343

reservoir size 1.5 years after ART initiation, and between viral blips after 1.5-5.4 years of

344

suppressive ART or low-level viremia and a slower decay rate [28]. Importantly, viral blips are

345

generally thought to reflect transient increases in viral replication, and probably occur under

346

multifactorial influence from viral and host factors [63–70], with these latter possibly including,

347

but not being limited to, germline genetic variation. The biological relations between viral

348

reservoir, decay rate, viral blips, and the contribution of the individual genetic background still

349

need full elucidation.

350

Standard GWAS is designed to detect associations with common genetic variants (i.e., with a

351

MAF of at least 0.05), with little power to investigate the role of rare variants. Thus, to further

352

assess the contribution of rare variants in individuals at the extreme of the decay rate

353

distribution, we used exome sequencing in a selected subset of 194 study participants with very

354

high decay rate, or conversely, a stable reservoir size over time (Figure S5). Here again, our

355

analyses did not detect significant associations with the phenotypes. Although not reaching

356

statistical significance, a rare genetic variant with potential functional impact in AMBRA1 had

357

a p-value for association just below the corrected threshold. The expression of AMBRA1, a core

358

component of the autophagy machinery, has previously been associated with long-term viral

359

control in HIV-1 non-progressors [71]. Future studies may further elucidate whether genetic

360

variation in AMBRA1 may account for inter-individual differences in the long-term dynamics

361

of the HIV-1 reservoir.

362

Large deletions or duplications of genomic material may be implicated in human phenotypes,

363

with CNVs impacting the exonic regions being more likely to have a functional role. Thus, we

364

further investigated whether any common or rare CNV spanning exonic regions was associated

365

with the phenotype. Again, no CNV was statistically associated with the phenotypes both in

366

the exome-wide analyses and in analyses focused on immune-related genes.

367

An inherent limitation of our exome-based association analyses was their inability to detect rare

368

variants outside the coding or splice-site regions. The exonic regions account for approximately

369

1-2% of the whole human genome. Because many regulatory sequences are located in extra-

370

genic sites, our analysis did not fully investigate the role of highly conserved, non-coding

371

genetic regions in influencing the phenotypes linked to HIV-1 latency.

372

Additionally, we focused on specific genetic variants, i.e., the HLA haplotypes and the

373

CCR5∆32 deletion, previously demonstrated to have a role in HIV-1 related phenotypes

374

[30,51]. Indeed, previous studies unraveled a robust association between variation in the HLA

375

region and the HIV-1 spVL [30]. Likewise, heterozygosity for the CCR5∆32 deletion has been

376

shown to influence spontaneous HIV-1 control [51]. Thus, we imputed HLA genotypes from

377

genotyping and exome data, and studied the CCR5∆32 deletion, without, however, detecting

378

any significant associations with the phenotypes or the covariates (Figure S9). Specifically, we

379

found no correlation between HLA genotypes and HIV-1 RNA plasma levels prior to ART

380

initiation, apparently contrasting with the previous findings of an association between HLA-

381

B*57:01 haplotype and spVL. This probably reflects historical changes in the therapeutic

382

approach following a diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, given that ART is currently initiated soon

383

after clinical diagnosis, before most patients reach a stable plateau of plasma viral load.

384

In our study, the quantification of the reservoir size at different time points may have been

385

influenced by factors as, for example, blips and low-level viremia, which may have reduced

386

our ability to detect significant genetic effects. It is also possible that, in the future, novel

387

methods to assess the viral reservoir will allow the detection of significant contributions of

388

genetic factors [72]. So far, it remains unanswered whether the initial response to acute

389

infection, the containment of ongoing replication, and the control of latently infected cells are

390

under the influence of the same or different molecular networks. It needs to be noted that in

391

previous work we have shown that host genetic factors as defined by GWAS did not explain

392

the severity of symptoms during acute HIV-infection, although severity of symptoms correlated

393

well with viral load and CD4 cell counts [73].

394

In conclusion, our study suggests that human individual germline genetic variation has little, if

395

any, influence on the control of the HIV-1 viral reservoir size and its long-term dynamics.

396

Complex, likely multifactorial biological processes govern HIV-1 viral persistence. Larger
