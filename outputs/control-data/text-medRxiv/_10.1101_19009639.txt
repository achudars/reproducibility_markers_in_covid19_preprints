ABSTRACT
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention,
impulsivity, and hyperactivity that is treated by an array of different modalities in order to
decrease functional impairment. Despite the variety of available pharmacologic treatment
options and their widespread use, there still remains a strong need to create innovative therapies.
Game Based Therapy (GBT) is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that seeks to increase the
efficacy of currently available pharmacological treatments through improving cognitive deficits
and reducing the current dose of such treatments. At the University of Kentucky, a clinical trial
was implemented to assess the effects of combining stimulant pharmacotherapy with the popular
video game Minecraft as Game Based Therapy on ADHD symptoms in children ages 10-15.
However, the low subject recruitment played a large role in the trial failing to produce conclusive
data from that site.
This trade study serves to address the difficulties of subject recruitment and determine an
optimal population and location for future adoption of the clinical trial. Through statistical
analysis of state, national, and survey data it was found that in Lexington, Kentucky, 18-21 year
olds are the optimal population for future GBT with pharmacotherapy clinical trials.
INTRODUCTION
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
characterized by difficulty paying attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity​1​ and is​ the most
commonly diagnosed behavioral disorder in children.​2​ ADHD was originally defined in children
but is now recognized to persist into adulthood for some patients. Despite this recognition, adult
ADHD remains underdiagnosed.​3​ A study using a nationally representative sample of adults in
the United States estimated that the prevalence of ADHD in adults was 4.4%.​4
Importantly, symptom presentation changes over a lifetime in individuals with ADHD
and can be associated with different profiles of functional impairment. Symptoms of
hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention during childhood often result in disruptive behavior at
home and in academic impairment at school. In adulthood, symptoms further evolve such that
hyperactivity decreases or morphs into more purposeful activity or inner restlessness, whereas

inattention, disorganization, and impulsivity remain, which can lead to functional difficulties in
home, social, and work settings.​5,6
Appropriate management of adult patients with ADHD is multimodal. Psychoeducation,
counseling, supportive problem-directed therapy, behavioral intervention, coaching, cognitive
remediation, and couples and family therapy are useful adjuncts to medication management.
Concurrent supportive psychosocial treatment or polypharmacy may be useful in treating the
adult with comorbid ADHD.​3
An array of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments are available for the
treatment of ADHD in adults. Nonpharmacologic therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), physical exercise, and mindfulness awareness
practice, have all been shown to confer benefits in adults with ADHD.​3​ CBT is a model that
combines higher-level organization and planning, behavioral skills training, and cognitive
restructuring. CBT has been used extensively as a stand-alone therapy and in combination with
pharmacotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in adults.​7​ Pharmacologic options include
psychostimulants, which have demonstrated the greatest levels of efficacy for treating the core
symptoms of ADHD in adults, and nonstimulants, which can be considered when there are
concerns related to response, tolerability, or safety with psychostimulants. ​Despite the variety of
available pharmacologic treatment options and their widespread use, there still remains a strong
need to create innovative therapies.​8
Unfortunately, the benefits that do result from stimulant use do not persist after
discontinuation and patients with ADHD still suffer from adverse long-term outcomes such as
poor academic performance, drug addiction, and criminal behavior to a much greater degree than
non-ADHD subjects despite optimal therapy.​9
The advantages of combining pharmaceutical therapy with behavioral therapy include
lower cost, as personnel time with patients is reduced, and reduced doses of pharmaceuticals
(50-75%). Additionally, the benefits of behavior therapy are more likely to carry forward once
treatment has stopped.​10
The possibility of a synergistic effect from combining pharmacological therapy with
Game Based Therapy (GBT) for use in ADHD treatment stems from being able to increase the
efficacy of currently available pharmacological treatments through improving cognitive deficits
and having the ability to reduce the current dose of such treatments. The suggested mechanism
for GBT improving ADHD symptoms is that improves the cognitive processes that underlie
them. Executive function, a potential intervention target, is a set of top-down mental processes

that regulate distracting influences and automatic, unproductive behaviors.​11​ As a result,
targeting executive function may allow patients to have better self-control.
Another advantage of utilizing video games for combination therapy is the fact that there
is a high volume of scenarios upon which to strengthen patients skills . Different scenarios each
day throughout treatment periods reduce the training effect and allow the patient to broaden
complex thinking skills instead of focusing on memorizing how to complete a specific task.
One study produced by Akili Interactive Labs, Inc. compared the cognitive functions’ of
neuro-typical children/those that lacked a diagnosis of ADHD with children that were diagnosed
with ADHD. Akili uses a technology entitled EVO to evaluate cognitive interference and the
potential maintenance of clinical benefit produced from game based therapy in children ages
8-12 with ADHD. EVO is used to assess reaction time, multitasking ability, and sustained
effects of game-based therapy after the end of treatment periods. The study found that there was
a significant improvement in the reaction time for the children with ADHD, and lacked a
statistically significant result for the neurotypical children.
Minecraft is an online video game containing a virtual land where users can create their
own worlds and experiences, using building blocks, resources discovered on the site and their
own creativity. Minecraft requires its users to apply problem solving, planning, and
organizational skills for creative building and exploration.​12​ It offers many levels of difficulty,
which allows for adaptation to users with a wide range of cognitive abilities as well as potential
for incremental progressions in difficulty as the user’s performance improves.
Our previous clinical study utilized the popular online video game, Minecraft, to evaluate
its potential for improving executive function in children, ages 10 to 15, with ADHD. The
personalized medicine approach included an individualized treatment regimen consisting of an
initial stimulant dose recommendation and schedule of Minecraft activities which were
determined by the initial ADHD assessment results of new patients.​13​ The study was designed to
create novel training activities that would address both the underlying core executive functions
(working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility), as well as executive function skills
utilized in school and work settings (planning, time management, self-regulation, sustained
attention, organization, goal-directed persistence, and metacognition). One of the overall goals of
the trial was to develop a better understanding of the relationship between ​NICHQ Vanderbilt
Assessment scores (an assessment that measures ADHD symptoms as well as the patient’s
function in everyday life)​, game aspects of Minecraft, and executive function.
This paper will serve as a trade study​14​ to collect and co​mpare relevant information
regarding two different age groups. ​A trade study (also known as a trade-off study) serves to

analyze the differentiating factors between two or more systems and identify the most balanced
technical solution. Trade studies utilize both quantitative and qualitative measures when
determining which solution will produce the optimal outcome. They examine critical factors
such as system cost, reliability, maintainability, logistic support, growth potential, and more to
improve systematic decisions. For example, if the challenge for an automotive company is to
design a vehicle that will bring in the most profit for the company, a trade study can be
performed. This allows automotive teams to look into different manufacturing materials,
locations for production, fuel-efficiency systems, etc. so that they can create different vehicles,
then identify the one with the best profit margin. For a clinical trial, there are many
outcome-influencing factors as well. For example, a disease may be location specific, like Ebola,
so if an organization were to do a clinical trial in a low-prevalence area, the results of the study
may not reflect the entire population.
The initial study​13​ sought to observe the effects of playing Minecraft on executive
function in pediatric patients, ages 10-15, with ADHD. The exploratory study used specially
designed technological activities to train executive function, working memory, and restraint
within the environment of the popular computer game Minecraft. The study attempted to
determine whether there is a functional relationship between NICHQ scores, game aspects of
Minecraft, and executive function. The primary measures of this study were the changes in
NICHQ scores, as measured by a NICHQ questionnaire before and after 4 weeks of therapeutic
gaming while simultaneously taking a stimulant type ADHD medication. All study participants
were recruited within UK Healthcare in Lexington, Kentucky from October of 2016 to June of
2018 .
The trial studying the 10-15 year old adolescent population in Lexington, Kentucky was
launched to determine the possibility of synergistic effects from GBT and pharmaceutical
therapy for ADHD.​13​ However, the trial failed to recruit a population large enough to be able to
make an accurate scientific conclusion. One major obstacle the study encountered was that ​you
cannot recruit in public schools unless you invest in getting permission. However, university
students are readily available, thus it may be easier to conduct a study in the 18-21 yea​r old
college student population.
This trade study will address specific risks, benefits, challenges, and future clinical
research directions associated with combining pharmacological and GBT for these two different
populations. The paper will also reveal the value of reproducing the initial study with the 18-21
year old population as well as address the reasons for low recruitment in the past. In order for the
future study to be executed we must meet requirements that include a minimum 16 subject
population that is recruitable within two months and an IRB approved population.

For the two different study groups we will assess 13 different categories that we believe
have a significant effect on subject recruitability and/or IRB approval. These categories and the
values associated with them will serve as evidence for determining statistical differences
between the two age groups. The 13 categories are as follows: transportation, the IRB
parent/guardian approval requirement for those under the age of 18, financial need, ADHD rate,
population density, population proximity, video game experience, life experience,
student/teacher relationship strength as determined by class size, medication therapeutic range,
obesity rate, sleeping disorder rate, and anxiety disorder rate. The descriptions of each category

A summary of the resulting comparison
To reiterate, in order to compare the 10-15 year old age group to the 18-21 year old age
group, thirteen different characteristics that may have an influence on an ADHD GBT clinical
trial were identified. These characteristics were then given values for each age group based upon
an in-depth literature search that served to reflect approximate demographics for Lexington,
Kentucky when obtainable. If Lexington demographics were unavailable, national demographics
were used. If national demographics or outside references were unavailable, a heuristic value
was given. ​Heuristic values are like “rules of thumb”, values which are not guaranteed to be the
true, real-world value, but are sufficient for immediate goals.​15​ Values that are heuristic are
indicated as such within the table above.
Throughout all tables within this study, higher values are designated more valuable to
recruitability and IRB approval versus lower values. However, certain category values were
switched between age groups due to the higher number being less desirable (e.g. being 10 miles
away from the clinical site is less desirable than 5 miles away- so the ‘10 miles away’ group
received a value of 5, and vice-versa​. The categorical values that were switched between age
groups included: location proximity, student/teacher relationship as determined by class size,
obesity risk, therapeutic dosing range, sleeping disorder rate, and anxiety disorder rate.
Four experts were recruited to rank the age group characteristics in order of magnitude of
effect on subject recruitment and IRB approval influence, with 1 being the least magnitude and
13 being the most. Two of the subjects lacked prior knowledge of the study and were recruited to
reduce subjective bias. The results of the survey are shown below in Table 1.
Table 1 - Survey Responses

In the first statistical analysis shown below in Table 2, each value for both age groups
was converted into a z-score, using the mean and standard deviation of the respective age group,
allowing the values to be more comparable to each other. Z-scoring allows us to compare two

values that are taken from different distributions, reducing leverage effects​.​ The 26 respective
z-scores were averaged between the two age groups, resulting in 13 z-score values. The values
were then weighted by multiplying the average subjective score for that specific characteristic.
These 13 ‘overall score’ values give us a subjective reference on the magnitude of effect on
subject recruitment and IRB approval influence for the corresponding characteristics. ​The higher
overall score correlates to a stronger influence that the characteristic will have on the clinical
trial.
Table 2 - Individual Age Group Values and Z-scores

In the second statistical analysis shown below in Table 3, the characteristic values were
once again z-scored by age, however this time they were z-scored using the combined means and
standard deviations of both age groups. The new 26 z-scores were then multiplied by the average
of the subjective scores to produce new subjective magnitudes. Once again, the higher the score,
the better the impact on the clinical trial.
Table 3 - Individual Age Group Values and Z-scores - Combined Mean & Std. Deviation

In the third statistical analysis shown below in Table 4, the higher characteristic values
that were deemed optimal for subject recruitability and IRB approval were given a ‘2’ for the age
group value, whereas the characteristic values that produced less optimal results for subject

recruitability and IRB approval were given a ‘1’ for the respective age group value. Using ‘1’
and ‘2’ for values allows for a simpler version of statistical analysis that focuses less on exact
numerical values and more on which age group is preferred for the respective category. The age
group values are then multiplied by their respective average subjective score. The resulting
individual scores are then totaled by age group. The higher overall score is expected to have the
optimal impact on subject recruitability and IRB approval. This categorical analysis shows that
regardless of using either exact values from a continuous distribution or categorical preference,
the result of the 18-21 year old age group being the optimal population remains the same.
Table 4 - Simplified Optimal Age Group Values for Subject Recruitment & IRB Approval

In the fourth statistical analysis shown below in Table 5, both of the age group values were
divided by the 18-21 year old values to get two respective comparable factors. The new factor
values were then multiplied by the corresponding average subjective score to produce concluding
values that were totaled for each age group. The higher overall score is expected to have a more
optimal expectation for subject recruitability and IRB approval.

The third and fourth statistical analyses were compared below in Table 6.

#6 - Sensitivity Analysis and Results
In order to test the ​subjective​ sensitivity of the trade model, the statistical analysis model
from Table 3 was used because of its mathematical simplicity. This time however, the average
respondent scores were not used, instead results were calculated using individual respondent
scores, creating 4 unique respondent results. The respondents included: PharmD/MSPS candidate
Dalton Lovins, PharmD/MBA candidate Conner Ball, UK College of Pharmacy pharmaceutical
outcomes and policy professor Dr. Patricia Freeman, and UK College of Pharmacy professor and
principal investigator for this study, Dr. Robert Lodder. Therefore, the sensitivity test will show
how even though different users ranked categories in different positions, the 18-21 year old age
group will still succeed in having the highest overall total, making them the optimal group for
clinical trial subject recruitability and IRB approval.

Conclusion, Adoption, and Further Analysis
The overall conclusion of this study is that the 18-21 year old age group in Lexington,
Kentucky is the optimal population for future GBT/ADHD clinical studies.
These data and analyses will be used for the future adoption of the 18-21 year old age
group for examining whether GBT has an effect on ADHD symptoms. For the next trial, a
maximum of 60 days will be allotted to recruiting at least 16 subjects in order to draw scientific
conclusions regarding the relationship between combination Game Based Therapy with
pharmacological treatment and ADHD symptoms.
An unexplored option regarding alternative trade studies includes separating the initial
survey question, which was, “Rank the age group characteristics in order of magnitude of effect
on subject recruitment and IRB approval influence, with 1 being the least magnitude and 13
being the most,” into two separate questions. In turn, one question would ask solely about the
magnitude of effect on subject recruitability and the other question would ask solely about the
magnitude of effect on IRB approval. This analysis would have been beneficial in comparing the
effect on survey responses, and subsequently the outcomes of similarly structured statistical
analyses.
