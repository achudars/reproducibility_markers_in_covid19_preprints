Research in context
Evidence before this study
We reviewed the literature on social networks from the 1800’s to 2018. Additionally, MEDLINE
was searched for ("Social Networking"[Mesh] OR "Social Network Analysis") AND ("Clinical
Trials as Topic"[Mesh] OR "Hematology"[Mesh] OR "Medical Oncology"[Mesh]) without date
restriction. The MEDLINE search yielded 43 results, of which 8 were relevant; none considered
gender nor temporality in their analyses. To our knowledge, there has not been any similar study
of the dynamic social network of clinical trialists from the inception of the fields of medical
oncology and hematology to the present.
Added value of this study
This is the first dynamic social network analysis of cancer clinical trialists. We found that the
network was sparse and siloed with a small number of authors having disproportionate impact
and influence as measured by network metrics such as PageRank; these metrics have become
more disproportionate over time. Women were under-represented and likelier to have lower
impact, shorter productive periods, less network centrality, and a greater proportion of co-authors
in their same cancer subspecialty.
Implications of all the available evidence
While gender disparities have been demonstrated in many fields including hematology/oncology,
our analysis is the first to show that network factors themselves are significantly implicated in
gender disparity. The increasing coalescence of the network by traditional cancer type and
around a small number of high-impact individuals implies challenges when the field pivots from
traditionally disease-oriented subspecialties to a precision oncology paradigm. New mechanisms
are needed to ensure diversity of clinical trialists.

Abstract
Background: Clinical trials establish the standard of care for cancer and other diseases. While
social network analysis has been applied to basic sciences, the social component of clinical trial
research is not well characterized. We examined the social network of cancer clinical trialists and
its dynamic development over more than 70 years, including the roles of subspecialization and
gender in relation to traditional and network-based metrics of productivity.
Methods: We conducted a social network analysis of authors publishing chemotherapy-based
prospective trials from 1946-2018, based on the curated knowledge base HemOnc.org,
examining: 1) network density; 2) modularity; 3) assortativity; 4) betweenness centrality; 5)
PageRank; and 6) the proportion of co-authors sharing the same primary cancer subspecialty
designation. Individual author impact and productive period were analyzed as a function of
gender and subspecialty.
Findings: From 1946-2018, the network grew to 29,197 authors and 697,084 co-authors. While
99.4% of authors were directly or indirectly connected as of 2018, the network had very few
connections and was very siloed by cancer subspecialty. Small numbers of individuals were
highly connected and had disproportionate impact (scale-free effects). Women were underrepresented and likelier to have lower impact, shorter productive periods (P<0.001 for both
comparisons), less centrality, and a greater proportion of co-authors in their same subspecialty.
The past 30 years were characterized by a trend towards increased authorship by women, with
new author parity anticipated in 2032. However, women remain a distinct minority of first/last
authors, with parity not anticipated for 50+ years.
Interpretation: The network of cancer clinical trialists is best characterized as a strategic or
“mixed-motive” network, with cooperative and competitive elements influencing its appearance.

Background and Motivation
The modern era of chemotherapy began in 1946, with publications describing therapeutic uses of
nitrogen mustard.1,2 Over the next 70 years, the repertoire of cancer treatment has expanded at an
ever-increasing pace. Chemotherapies have a notably low therapeutic index, making them the
most dangerous interventions commonly used in biomedicine.3 Consequently, a complex
international clinical trial apparatus emerged in the 1970s and prospective clinical trials remain
the gold standard by which standard of care treatments are established.4,5 Discoveries made by
successive generations have led to overall improvement in the prognosis of most cancers.6
While social network analysis has been used in scientific settings,7,8 the social component of
clinical trial research is not well characterized. How social dynamics have influenced progress
over time, as cancer care has become increasingly subspecialized, remains to be understood.
Little is known about how social factors have shaped the field, and how social network
characteristics may reveal patterns of inclusiveness, exclusivity, and disparity. We hypothesized
that the social network of cancer clinical trialists would be a “strategic” aka “mixed motive”
network, where collaborative and competitive pressures are counterbalanced; this type of social
network may be especially prone to preferential attachment and social disparities.9,10
Here, we analyzed the individual impact and collaborative relationships of cancer clinical
trialists, using co-authorship to define social networks. Our primary objective was to model the
social network and its dynamic development over time; secondary objectives were to examine
the roles of subspecialization and gender in relation to metrics of productivity.

All prospective trials of systemic antineoplastics published between 1946-2018 and referenced
on HemOnc.org were considered for inclusion. HemOnc.org is the largest collaborative wiki of
chemotherapy drugs and regimens and has a formal curation process (eMethods).11 For each
included publication, author names were extracted, disambiguated, and mapped to gender
(eMethods and Supplemental Files 1 & 2). Every author was assigned an impact score, using
an algorithm based on four aspects of their publications: author role (first/last versus middle
author); citations; trial design (randomized versus non-randomized); and whether the publication
was primary or an update (eMethods).
Each publication was assigned to disease-specific subspecialties based on the cancer(s) studied
(eTable 1), and authors were assigned a primary subspecialty based on impact (eMethods).
Author longevity was calculated as the interval between their first and final publication in the
database. Given that preparing and publishing results of clinical trials can take substantial time,
for authors with first publication prior to 2016 and final in 2016 or 2017, final was adjusted to
2018.
Social network metrics (eGlossary): A dynamic social network was created with nodes
representing authors and links representing co-authorship. The dynamic social network was
discretized by year and the authors, scores, and links were cumulative (e.g., the 20th network was
cumulative from 1946-1965). Therefore, once an author is added to the network, they remain in
the network, with their impact score cumulatively increasing as they publish and remaining
constant if publication activity ceases. The following temporal metrics were calculated: 1)
network density; 2) modularity12 by subspecialty; 3) assortativity13 by subspecialty; 4)
betweenness centrality14; 5) PageRank15; and 6) proportion of co-authors sharing the same
primary subspecialty designation (hereafter – homophily). All metrics except homophily

incorporated the weighted co-authorship score, which takes into account each co-author’s impact
modified by the number of authors of an individual publication (see eMethods). In order to
visualize the final cumulative network, layout was determined using the distributed recursive
graph algorithm.16 Nodes were sized by author impact score rank and colored by primary
subspecialty designation. Edge width was determined by the weighted co-authorship score.
Statistical analysis: Non-independent network metrics including growth, density, assortativity,
modularity, and PageRank are reported descriptively with medians and interquartile ranges
(IQR). Gender proportion over time was fit with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing
(LOESS) regression using default settings of degree=2 with smoothing parameter/span a=0.75.17
For the final cumulative network, the independent variables author impact score and longevity
were compared 1) between genders and 2) by whether the author changed subspecialties over
time; only those authors with longevity ³1 year were included in the second comparison. These
comparisons were made with the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test; P value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Sensitivity analysis: To determine whether the scoring algorithm was robust to modifications, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis where the author role and trial design coefficients were varied by
+/-67% and +/-50%, respectively. Normalized density distributions for the final cumulative
network under each permutation were calculated, and temporal assortativity and modularity were
compared to baseline with Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

N=5,599 of 6,301 reviewed publications with an aggregate of n=29,197 authors met inclusion
criteria (CONSORT eFigure 1). Cumulatively, most authors (78%) participated in publication of
a randomized trial, with 52.5% participating in the publication of a “positive” trial (eTable 2).
The median number of authors per publication increased from six in 1946 to 20 (IQR 16-25) in
2018 (eFigure 2).
The final network is very sparse (0.16% of possible links are present); nevertheless, n=29,029
(99.4%) authors are in a single connected component; the next-largest component comprises 14
authors.
Network dynamics
Authorship and co-authorship have grown by over 200,000%: in 1946 there were 12 authors &
30 co-authors; by 2018, there were cumulatively 29,197 authors & 697,084 co-authors (Figure
1A). Median longevity is <1 year at all times, although the number of authors with multiple years
in the field grows substantially over time (eFigure 3). A small number of individuals maintained
the highest impact over time – nearly 20 years each in the case of chemotherapy pioneers Sidney
Farber and James F. Holland (eFigure 4). In any given year, most authors had a betweenness
centrality of <1% of the maximum; conversely, a very small number of authors had an
exceptionally high score, with 1% of authors accounting for 100% of the total in recent years
(eFigure 5). Accordingly, an increasingly smaller proportion of authors were both very highly
connected and highly impactful; e.g., in 1970, the 10% highest-impact authors (N=20) account
for 21.4% of links and 54.9% of impact; in 2018, the same proportion (N=2,920) account for
37.1% of links and 62.3% of impact. First/last authorship has also become concentrated; in 2018
publications, 10% of authors had at least one such role, whereas prior to 1980 it was on average
>25% (eFigure 6).

The structure of the network changes considerably over time, from relatively dense and
connected to sparse and modular (Figure 1B). Each of thirteen cancer subspecialties develops at
different rates, with clear influence of seminal events in several subspecialties, e.g., the
introduction of adjuvant therapy and tamoxifen for breast cancer, completely new classes of
drugs for plasma cell disorders, and immunotherapy for melanoma (Figure 1C).18–24
Network visualization and cumulative metrics
The final cumulative network visualization is shown in Figure 2. The impact score of authors is
unevenly distributed, median 0.0532 (range 0-14.31); however, the log-transformed impact
scores approximate a normal distribution (eFigure 7). Authors with longevity ³1 year who
changed primary subspecialty at least once (n=2,330) had nearly twice the median impact and
longevity of those who remained in one subspecialty (n=10,276), 0.25 (IQR 0.11-0.6) versus
0.14 (IQR 0.07-0.35) and 13 years (IQR 6-19) versus 7 years (IQR 3-12), respectively (P<0.001
for both comparisons).
Cumulatively, subspecialized authors with calculable homophily (n=24,560) have a median
proportion of co-authors sharing the same subspecialty of 88% (IQR 76-95%); 945,167 (71.4%)
of these authors’ outlinks are within-subspecialty. This is reflected by a high assortativity by
subspecialty since the mid-1960s (Figure 1B).
Gender disparities
The proportion of woman authors remained at a nearly steady state of 15% until 1980, when it
began to gradually increase to a recent high of ~40%; over the same time period, the proportion
of woman first/last authors rose much more slowly (Figure 3A). Cumulatively, n=17,187 men
had a statistically significantly higher median impact than n=8,511 women, 0.075 (IQR 0.032-

0.22) versus 0.051 (IQR 0.022-0.133), P<0.001; statistically significantly longer median
longevity, 1 year (IQR 0-8) versus 0 years (IQR 0-5), P<0.001; and higher median PageRank,
1.75 x 10-5 (IQR 1.01 x 10-5-3.68 x 10-5) versus 1.34 x 10-5 (IQR 8.74 x 10-6-2.51 x 10-5). For the
n=15,229 men and n=7,245 women with a calculable homophily, men had a lower median
proportion of co-authors within the same primary subspecialty, 0.88 (IQR 0.75-0.95) versus 0.89
(IQR 0.78-0.95). Scatterplots of longevity versus author impact score and PageRank versus
homophily are shown in Figures 3B & 3C for the final cumulative network; prior years are
shown in eFigures 8 & 9.
Sensitivity analysis
Normalized score distributions did not change significantly, although modulation of the trial
design coefficient led to a bimodal peak (eFigure 10). Correlation of assortativity and
modularity was high, ranging from 0.815-0.999 for the former and 0.981-0.999 for the latter
(eTable 3; eFigure 11).
Discussion
The remarkable gains in the fields of hematology and oncology can be ascribed to the tireless
work of numerous trialists and the generosity of countless patient participants. As a result,
systemic antineoplastics now stand beside surgery and radiotherapy as a pillar of cancer care.
Our analysis of clinical trialists as a social network reveals a mixed-motive network that differs
substantially from “collegial” and “friend-based” commercial online social networks. While
clinical trials are conducted towards a collaborative goal – improved outcomes for all cancer
patients – there are significant competitive pressures. Examples of these pressures include
resource limitations (e.g., funding and patients available for accrual), the tension between

prioritization of cooperative group versus industry-funded trials, personal motivations such as
academic promotion or leadership opportunities, and institutional reputation.
The emergence of formal and informal leaders in scientific networks has been shown to facilitate
research as well as create silos.25 As Figure 2 shows, there is a strong tendency for siloing based
on subspecialty in the complete network, although some subspecialties (e.g., lymphoid and
myeloid malignancies) have many more interconnections than others (e.g., sarcoma and neurooncology). Many of these silos appear to be organized around an individual or group of
individuals who have high impact and centrality. As an organizational principle, these
individuals appear to rarely be in direct competition, but their presence is a clear indicator of
scale-free phenomena within the network. The facts that betweenness follows a power law
cumulative distribution bolsters this theory. Scale-free phenomena, which are defined by a power
law distribution of connectedness, are very common in strategic networks, especially when they
become increasingly sparse, as this network does.26 The two related theories for this network
behavior are preferential attachment and fitness. The former observes that those with impact tend
to attract more impact; the latter postulates that such gains for the “fittest” come at the expense
of the “less fit.”27 Seminal events (Figure 1C) are likely a driver of preferential attachment,28
and may partially explain why some authors change their primary subspecialty at least once over
time (e.g., through a “bandwagon” effect driven by the diffusion of ideas29). Given that these
authors were observed to have nearly twice the impact and longevity of their single subspecialty
peers, this dynamic will be a focus of future study, including calculation of the Q factor
described by Sinatra et al.30
In the analysis of network dynamics (Figure 1B), the field as a whole appears to emerge in the
1970s, which is also when formal recognition of medical oncology and hematology through

board certification occurred. Measurements of field maturity are by their nature subjective, but
the pessimism31 of the late 1960s was captured by Sidney Farber: “…the anticancer chemicals,
hormones, and the antibiotics…marked the beginning of the era of chemotherapy of cancer,
which may be described after 20 years as disappointing because progress has not been more
rapid…”.32 These concerns led directly to the US National Cancer Act of 1971, which was
followed by the leveling of modularity at a very high level from 1976 onwards, suggesting that
the subspecialties generated in the 1970s have remained stable. The assortativity by subspecialty
has increased as well, with recent levels approximately twice those seen in a co-authorship
network of physicists.33 While median PageRank has decreased markedly, indicating decreasing
influence for the average author, the distribution in 2018 is broadly right-skewed (eFigure 12).
These findings reveal a high level of exclusivity, which has been increasing over time,
suggesting that it is becoming increasingly difficult to join the top echelon of the network. This
has major implications for junior investigators’ mobility, and potentially the continued health of
the network as a whole.
While there is much to be applauded in the continued success of translating research findings
into the clinic, we observed clear gender disparities within the cancer clinical trialist network.
Women have a statistically significantly lower final impact score, shorter productive period, less
centrality, and less collaboration with those outside of their primary subspecialty. These findings
are consistent with and build upon previous literature on the challenges facing women
academics.34,35 Others studies investigating the basis for such a gender gap have identified
several layers of barriers to the advancement of women in academic medicine. These include
sexism in the academic environment, lack of mentorship, and inequity with regards to resource
allocation, salary, space, and positions of influence.36,37 Our study suggests that additional

network factors such as relatively low centrality, which indicates a lack of access to other
individuals of influence, and high homophily, which indicates a lack of access to fresh ideas and
perspectives, also perpetuate the gender gap – corroborating recent findings from graduate
school social networks.38
It is somewhat encouraging that there has been a steady increase in the proportion of authorship
by women since 1980 (Figure 3A). This increase is observed approximately 10 years after the
passage of Title IX of the US Civil Rights Act in 1972. Given that the majority of authors in this
network are clinicians, a partial explanation is that US-based women began to attend previously
all-male medical schools in the early 1970s, completed their training, and began to contribute to
the network as authors approximately 10 years later. If the nearly linear trend continues, we
predict that gender parity for new authors entering the network will be reached by the year 2032,
26 years after US medical school enrollment approached parity.39 However, the proportion of
woman first/last authors is growing much more slowly, and parity may not be reached for 50+
years, if at all. Given that senior authorship is a traditional metric of scholarly productivity, it
may be particularly difficult for clinical trialists who are women to obtain promotion under the
current paradigm. One possible solution is to increase the role of joint senior authorship, which
remains vanishingly rare in the clinical trials domain (Furman et al. 201440 is one of very few
examples that we are aware of) – although this is predicated on the acceptance of these roles by
advancement and promotion committees. The field itself may also suffer from slow entry of new
talent and a lack of broad perspectives.
While the gender mapping algorithm and manual lookups are imperfect, our approach is
consistent with prior work in this area.34,41 Unisex names posed a particular challenge.42 It should
be noted that we could not account for all situations where an author changed their name (e.g., a

person assumed their spouse’s surname); this could have led to overestimation of representation
by women and underestimation of impact, since this practice is more common with women. It is
also possible that an individual’s gender identity does not match the gender assignment of their
given name. Future work will include further analysis of gender disparities, factoring in
institutional affiliation and highest degree(s) obtained, which are both likely to have significant
influence on publication and senior authorship.43,44
There are several additional limitations to this work, starting with the fact that co-authorship is
but one way to measure social network interactions and this study reports results from published
trials, which induces publication bias. Although HemOnc.org aims to be the most comprehensive
resource of its kind, non-randomized and randomized phase II trials are intentionally
underrepresented, given that findings at this stage of investigation infrequently translate to
practice-changing results (e.g., approximately 70% of oncology drugs fail during phase II).45–47
The effect of any biases introduced by this underrepresentation is unclear, given the confounding
influence of publication bias, which may itself be subject to gender disparity.48 Some older
literature which no longer has practice-changing implications may have been overlooked.
During name disambiguation, some names could not be resolved, primarily because neither
MEDLINE nor the primary journal site contained full names. This effect is non-random, since
certain journals do not publish full names. The choice of coefficients and their relative weights
was based on clinical intuition and consensus; given that the “worth” of metrics such as first/last
authorship is fundamentally qualitative, there must be some degree of subjectivity when
formulating a quantitative algorithm. While the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that neither
normalized author impact score distribution, assortativity, nor modularity are majorly changed
by variation in the trial design and author role coefficients, it remains possible that other

combinations of coefficients and relative weightings could lead to different results. Furthermore,
our impact algorithm weighs heavily on first and last authorship, but the definition of senior
authorship has changed over time. For example, in the 1946 article by Goodman et al.,2 the
authors were listed in decreasing order of seniority (personal communication). Finally, the
majority of authors in this database publish extensively and their impact as measured here should
not be misconstrued to reflect their contributions to the cancer field more broadly.
In conclusion, we have described the first and most comprehensive social network analysis of the
clinical trialists involved in chemotherapy trials. We found emergent properties of a strategic
network, as well as clear indications of gender disparities, albeit with some improvement in
representation in recent decades. The network has been highly modular and assortative for the
past 40 years, with little collaboration across most subspecialties. As hematology and oncology
pivot from an anatomy-based to a precision medicine paradigm, it remains to be seen how the
network will re-organize so that the incredible progress seen to date can continue.

Figure 1. Network characteristics. A: Cumulative growth in authorship and co-authorship over
time have both been nearly log-linear; B: Network density decreases asymptotically from 45.5%
in 1946 to 0.16% in 2018; modularity follows a sigmoid pattern with a period of linear increase
between 1960-80 followed by a plateau at high modularity; assortativity rapidly increases in
early decades; median normalized PageRank decreases to a low plateau from the 1970s onward;

C: Subspecialties develop at different but broadly parallel rates, with seminal events apparently
preceding accelerations of individual subspecialties, e.g.,: 1) in the four years after 1973,
combination therapy (AC18), adjuvant therapy19, and tamoxifen20 were introduced in breast
cancer; 2) thalidomide21 and bortezomib22 were reported to be efficacious for multiple myeloma;
and 3) immunotherapy (ipilimumab23,24) was introduced in the treatment of melanoma.

Figure 2. Final cumulative network visualization. The social network graph represents the
cumulative field of cancer research as of December 31, 2018, with all included published works
since 1946 contributing to authorship and co-authorship weights. Only authors assigned to a
subspecialty are visualized; these account for 84% of all authors in the database.

Figure 3. Gender disparities in the network. A: The network is overwhelmingly dominated by
men until 1980, when a trend towards increasing authorship by women begins to be seen;
however, representation by women in first/last authorship remains low; gray shaded lines are
95% confidence intervals of the LOESS curves; B: Men tend on average to have a longer
productive period and to achieve a higher author impact score than women (P<0.001 for both
comparisons); C: Men tend on average to be more central and have more collaborations outside

which explains the slightly lower numbers in 3C as compared to 3B.
