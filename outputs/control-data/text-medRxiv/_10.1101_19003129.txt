ABSTRACT

42

Introduction: United Nations sustainable development goals aim for the elimination

43

of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, leading to efforts to upscale the

44

availability and accessibility of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, diagnosis and

45

treatment globally. However, a variety of societal factors, including beliefs, traditions,

46

and stigma, can be a major obstacle to all of these interventions. We therefore set

47

out to investigate how HBV is understood and described in communities in Uganda,

48

and whether there is evidence of potential stigma.

49

Method: We carried out a qualitative formative study in two sites in South Western

50

Uganda: a village in Kalungu district (site A) and an area on the outskirts of Masaka

51

town (site B). We undertook a rapid assessment to investigate how adults describe

52

HBV infection and their perceptions about the infection. We collected data by

53

conducting a transect walk, observations, community group discussions, and in-

54

depth interviews, sampling a total of 131 individuals. We used inductive content

55

analysis to extract key themes associated with HBV.

56

Results: There is no specific word for HBV infection in local languages, and

57

knowledge about this infection is varied. While some individuals were completely

58

unfamiliar with HBV infection, some had heard of HBV. Radio was a common source

59

of information. There was awareness of HBV as a cause of liver disease, limited

60

knowledge regarding the cause, mode of transmission and treatment. Stigma in HBV

61

may be rare in this community due to limited understanding and experience of HBV.

62

Conclusion: There is an ongoing need to improve awareness and understanding of

63

HBV in this community. Careful dissemination of accurate information is required to

64

promote acceptance of interventions for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

INTRODUCTION

66

Globally, approximately 290 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B

67

virus (HBV), and more than 800,000 people consequently die each year from liver

68

cirrhosis or liver cancer (1). In response to the United Nations Sustainable

69

Development Goals, which aim to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by

70

the year 2030 (2), HBV infection is receiving increasing recognition with efforts to

71

upscale prevention, diagnosis and treatment (1,3). However, there are complex

72

barriers to the elimination of this infection in the African subcontinent, including a

73

high prevalence of chronic infection (≥8% in many settings), >90% of those infected

74

being undiagnosed, and poor awareness (4,5).

75
76

Stigma and discrimination are recognised in the setting of chronic viral hepatitis

77

infections, but there is very limited research to determine the nature and impact of

78

stigma in communities in Africa (4). To date, only three studies have been carried out

79

in Africa exploring the social impact of HBV. In Zambia, stigma has been reported to

80

be a barrier to HBV disclosure and referral of contacts for testing (6), whereas in

81

Ghana, low levels of knowledge and pervasive misconceptions about HBV contribute

82

towards psychological and social problems among individuals with chronic infection

83

(7,8). There has been no previous work on stigma in HBV in Uganda, although HBV

84

is highly endemic in some regions (prevalence estimates vary from 6-52% (9–11)).

85
86

Given the high prevalence of HBV in Uganda, and the emerging evidence of stigma

87

in HBV, we sought to investigate how adolescents and adults in rural and peri-urban

88

communities in Uganda describe HBV infection, their perceptions, beliefs and

89

experiences about the infection and whether there is evidence of stigma.

90
91

METHODS

92

Study setting

93

We conducted the study at two sites in South West Uganda:

94

i.

Site A: This is a village location within the General Population Cohort (GPC).

95

The GPC was established in a rural population in south-western Uganda in

96

Kyamulibwa sub-county of Kalungu district in 1989, with the initial aim of

97

studying the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in a rural population, but subsequently

98

also being a source of recruitment for other research studies (12,13). The

99

GPC comprises 25 study villages with a total population of approximately

100

25,000 people. Most of the inhabitants practice small-scale farming. Local

101

tribes are Baganda, Banyarwanda, Barundi, and Banyakole. A number of

102

infectious diseases are prevalent, including HIV (prevalence ~10%), malaria,

103

hepatitis B and C (HBV prevalence 3% HCV <1%), sexually transmitted

104

infections and respiratory tract infections. Within this sub-county, there are a

105

number of public and private health care facilities and traditional healers. We

106

selected Site A for this study because a previous survey on HBV reported a

107

higher prevalence within this village compared to elsewhere in the GPC

108

(unpublished data).

109
110

ii.

Site B: This is a peri-urban site in Masaka Municipality, located along the

111

highway that connects Uganda to the Democratic Republic of Congo,

112

Tanzania and Rwanda, with a high concentration of low-cost housing. Most of

113

the inhabitants earn their living from small businesses including motorcycle

114

transport, selling food and running bars; crop farming is also undertaken

115

locally. The tribes represented in this region are Baganda, Banyarwanda,

116

Batoro and Basoga. The HIV prevalence in this setting may be slightly higher

117

than within the GPC, but accurate data are not available. The prevalence of

118

viral hepatitis infection is also not known but is likely to be higher than the

119

GPC, given the concentration of settlements in the area and many inhabitants

120

from different areas of Uganda. There are several private and public health

121

care facilities in this site.

122
123

Study design

124

Between July and October 2018, we conducted a rapid qualitative assessment to

125

investigate how HBV is described, the experiences and beliefs associated with HBV

126

and the nature of any associated stigma. These rapid methods included transect

127

walks, observations, introductory group sessions, community group discussions and

128

in-depth interviews (Table 1), with the intention that the different methods

129

complemented each other. Fieldwork was conducted at Site A first, after which the

130

field team moved to Site B.

131
132

Data collection

133

Data collection was done by two social science research assistants who have an

134

understanding of these communities and are fluent in Luganda, the local language

135

commonly used within the study setting. The research assistants were first trained

136

on all aspects of the study and the use of a rapid qualitative assessment approach

137

(14). Before visits to the study communities, the research teams met with local

138

leaders and explained the purpose of the study and sought permission to enter these

139

communities. All the data were recorded using field notes that were expanded

140

immediately after data collection.

141
142

i.

Transect spiral walk: the aim was to observe, discuss and find key features

143

in the community that would inform our other methodologies such as

144

identifying settlement patterns, health centres, churches, mosques, traditional

145

healers, trading centres, bars and any other places where people within

146

communities concentrate. The transect walk was performed to understand the

147

daily activities of people within the community in order to plan for the other

148

assessment methods effectively. Two members of the research team first

149

visited the local leader of each study site and explained the reasons of the

150

activity within this community. With the help of the local leader, the team

151

identified the centre of each village that was used as a starting point. The

152

team then split into two with each person taking a different direction. They

153

moved in concentric circles until the whole village was covered. During the

154

walk, observations were made in addition to talking to a few people.

155

ii.

Observations: informed by the transect walk, we visited particular places of

156

interest to make observations. The team engaged with members of the

157

community and healthcare providers (including traditional healers and village

158

health teams (VHTs), with the aim of better understanding the characteristics

159

of individuals seeking health care, how and where they are treated, common

160

illnesses, familiarity with HBV including local terms to describe it, its signs and

161

symptoms and any personal experience of individuals with HBV infection.

162

iii.

Introductory group sessions: we met with ten influential people within each

163

community including community leaders and local religious leaders, who had

164

been identified based on information collected during the transect walks. The

165

aim of these sessions was to understand perceptions and beliefs of diseases

166

and illnesses in the community, and to explore understanding and

167

experiences of HBV infection. The sessions were moderated by one

168

interviewer, while the other was observing and taking notes.

169

iv.

Community group discussions: we facilitated group discussions among

170

adolescents and adults to find out about perceptions and beliefs of disease

171

within the community, specifically exploring understanding and experiences of

172

HBV infection. Four discussions were held at each study site with ten

173

participants in each group. These participants were identified after the first

174

three visits within the study communities.

175

v.

In-depth individual interviews: We interviewed a selected group of

176

individuals who were willing to give information about their experiences, to

177

allow deeper exploration of relevant issues established from the previous

178

stages.

Data management and analysis

183

Researchers involved with data collection provided detailed description of their

184

observations and interviews in accounts written up from the notes. Two other

185

researchers reviewed the transcripts prior to analysis for to check the quality and

186

accuracy, and thereafter independently coded the transcripts. Themes and sub-

187

themes relating to perceptions, beliefs and experiences of HBV and the description,

Approval was provided by The Science and Ethics Committee of the Uganda Virus

193

Research Institute (ethics no GC/127/18/05/645) and UK Oxford Tropical Ethics

194

Committee, OxTREC, (ethics no. 516-18). All participants provided written informed

195

consent for interviews and discussion groups. The local leaders provided verbal

196

consent for the transect walks within their communities while health care providers,

197

including traditional healers, consented for observations.

Between September and December 2018, we collected data from a total of 131

210

and socio-demographic characteristics of study participants.

Awareness of HBV infection in these communities was varied. The commonest

214

means of acquiring knowledge on HBV infection was through radio advertisements

215

which encouraged members of the community to get tested and immunised

216

(reported by 31 participants, age range 18-70 years). Others had personal

217

experience of knowing someone perceived to be infected or diagnosed with HBV

218

(reported by 30 individuals, age range 18 – 70 years). Among these respondents, 20

219

reported the death of individuals perceived to have HBV infection shortly after

220

admission to a healthcare facility or as soon as they became symptomatic. One

221

personal experience was reported by a teacher from site B: “A neighbour who had

222

gone to work at the lake shore came back when he was already infected. He was

223

referred to a hospital in Kampala but died after two days”.

224
225

There were some participants who reported not having heard of HBV infection and

226

therefore felt that it may not be a common illness, including both males and females

227

from both settings. There is no specific name for HBV infection; naming of a disease

228

in this community commonly depends on the symptoms of the disease. The local

229

phrases used to describe liver disease are "Obulwadde bwekibumba” and

230

“endwadde y'ekibumba" which literally translate to ‘the liver is sick’.

231
232

Insights into HBV as a cause of liver disease

233

As the symptoms and signs of HBV are not distinct from other causes of liver

234

disease, there may be poor understanding of the role of an infectious agent. This is

235

illustrated from a comment recorded from the community group discussions at site A,

236

“We do not know about its mode of transmission, signs and causes so we cannot tell

237

if the disease exists in the community”. Three participants specifically reported that

238

they are not able to distinguish HBV from other illnesses.

239
240

More generally, some participants were able to list other causes of liver disease

241

including excessive consumption of alcohol and eating fatty foods. Insect bites,

242

exposure to pesticides/fertilisers and drinking dirty water were also suggested as

243

causes of liver disease. For example, a man at Site B commented that: “it could be

244

caused through excessive drinking of waragi [local gin].... myrrh, khat drugs, herbal

245

medicine, and fertilisers/pesticides can affect and make the liver sick”, while a

246

woman of a similar age in Site A suggested that it was caused by “walking through

247

dirty swamp water which contains certain germs that cause liver disease”. Some of

248

the symptoms that participants reported in association with HBV (or more generally

249

with liver disease) included abdominal or whole body swelling, jaundice/yellow eyes,

250

weight loss, and hair loss. Three participants mentioned that HBV was

251

asymptomatic. Thirteen participants, mainly from Site A, were not able to suggest

252

any signs or symptoms associated with HBV. Eight participants (aged 18-60 years)

253

reported a similarity in signs and symptoms between HIV and HBV.

254
255

Perceptions of mode of transmission

256

A number of participants, predominantly from Site B, reported that they did not know

257

how HBV is transmitted. Three people believed that transmission routes included

258

sharing of public toilets/bathrooms, or sharing of utensils and clothing. A male at site

259

B stated: “When he shares any equipment - say clothing, cups and forks with a

260

person who looked malnourished - he would feel as if he was to contract the

261

infection from him/her, not good to share anything with the patient”.

262
263

Of the eight healthcare professionals who took part in this study, only five knew that

264

HBV is sexually transmitted and can also be transmitted through other exposures to

265

infected body fluids. Five participants from Site A reported that anyone was at risk of

266

contracting HBV. People who consumed alcohol or those who engage in risky sexual

267

behaviours were considered to be at risk of contracting HBV infection. One

268

participant interpreted the high-profile campaigns around HBV immunisation for

269

adults as suggesting that only adults were susceptible to infection.

270
271

Knowledge of, and access to, HBV treatment

272

Community members suggested possible management interventions, including

273

modified diet and herbal medicine. Twelve participants, mostly from Site A (age

274

range 18-70 years), did not know any treatment for HBV. Three young men from Site

275

B reported that HBV has no cure. Others correctly recognised that antiretroviral

276

drugs can be used in managing HBV infection, and that those infected are put-on

277

long-term treatment, but some of the comments suggested that there is pessimism

278

about outcomes, with participants suggesting poor chances of survival.

279
280

Potential challenges facing HBV management

281

The asymptomatic nature of HBV can be a barrier to seeking healthcare services;

282

some community members only seek treatment when the symptoms are noticeable

283

and have worsened, and it may be common to stop taking medication in the absence

284

of symptoms. Poverty, preference for traditional/herbal medicine and lack of

285

awareness about a disease, can also contribute to delays in seeking healthcare and

286

be barriers to seeking preventive, diagnostic and treatment services among

287

members of the community. A description of a child unwell as a result of HBV

288

infection was provided by a male participant at Site A: “When the boy fell sick, he

289

was taken to the health centre for treatment. He was not admitted but they gave him

290

some tablets which he didn’t understand. He took the tablets and after a week the

291

stomach normalized. About 3 weeks later, the stomach resumed swelling. He was

292

taken to herbal clinic and was given 5 litres of herbal medicine and he was told to go

293

back after one week. When the herbal was finished, he went back and still he was

294

given the same drugs. By that time his eyes had a yellowish colour, his urine was

295

also yellow”.

296
297

Lack of diagnostic facilities, and limited access to healthcare professionals and

298

medications contribute to the challenges facing HBV prevention, diagnosis and

299

therapy in this community. A female healthcare worker at site A explained: “She can’t

300

even give that patient any drug, only refers him or her to Masaka hospital. She said

301

that they don’t have the machines that can diagnose it, so they have to refer the

302

patient.” Among healthcare workers, poor knowledge can impede diagnosis and

303

treatment for HBV infection. Three healthcare professionals reported not having

304

received a complete course of HBV vaccination themselves and are therefore at

305

increased risk of becoming infected.

306
307

Community perceptions and experience of HBV

308

We sought to understand the perception of community members about the

309

occurrence and persistence of HBV infection in their community. Eleven participants,

310

mostly from Site B reported that HBV was a new infection in their community

311

because they had become aware of it only recently. For ten people who commented

312

that HBV was a long-standing problem, their knowledge came from a community

313

member known to them whom they believed had died of the infection. Others

314

claimed that HBV was “an old sickness” which had been in the communities for a

315

long time.

317

Emotional responses to HBV infection

318

Communities tend to fear diseases based on symptoms and outcomes associated

319

with the disease. In particular, a disease can be feared because it is incurable and

320

may be seen as leading inevitably to death(4). Stigma may stem from this fear, as

321

well as from changes in body appearance that can limit interactions with other

322

community members. Eight participants, primarily from Site B, reported that they

323

would be scared or more cautious to take care of someone with an infectious

324

disease. Ten participants, mostly men from Site B (age 18–50 years), reported a

325

feeling of shame associated with sexually transmitted diseases. However, eleven

326

participants, reported no fear or shame towards people infected with HBV, partly

327

because it is a disease that is not well known within the community.

328
329

DISCUSSION

330

With the recent increased attention regarding the urgent need to upscale prevention,

331

diagnosis and treatment of HBV infection globally, understanding the social impact of

332

HBV infection in communities is important as this influences acceptability and impact

333

of interventions. To date, there is very limited research on behaviour and beliefs

334

surrounding HBV infection in Africa.

335
336

Familiarity with HBV infection in the communities we investigated can be explained,

337

in part, by the recent efforts by the Ministry of Health in Uganda to combat

338

transmission of HBV by promoting vaccination among adolescents and young adults

339

(15), particularly using radio messages to reach a wide audience. As a result, the

340

syndrome of HBV infection is now recognised by many adults in this setting.

341

However, even among healthcare workers, there is still a lack of in-depth

342

understanding, in keeping with similar studies in Ghana and Zambia (4,6–8). The

343

importance of education is highlighted by a study of HBV infection undertaken in

344

Turkey(16).

345
346

Naming of a disease can be a reflection of how much it is recognised and

347

understood (17,18). In our study population, local names used to describe diseases

348

are based on the symptoms the sufferer bears. In part, this practice is encouraged

349

by the WHO which states that a name of a disease should be based on the

350

‘symptoms, disease manifestation, severity and, if known, the pathogen causing the

351

disease’ (19). Naming HBV infection poses a challenge, since there is no specific

352

symptom that distinguishes it from other liver diseases, and in many instances, it

353

remains asymptomatic until the end-stages of infection. Although we identified local

354

terms that broadly describe liver disease, gaps remain in understanding of HBV

355

infection, particularly with regard to the infectious agent (19).

356
357

Stigma

358

As a result of limited understanding and experience of HBV in our study population,

359

stigma did not emerge as a strong theme. However, fear of symptoms and outcomes

360

of a disease, as well as shame associated with mode of transmission of infection,

361

can determine how those infected might be handled within their communities (20,21),

362

and can lead on to stigma. Although sex is not the main route of transmission of HBV

363

infection, this association could nevertheless lead to stigma and discrimination (22).

364

Although HBV is asymptomatic in most cases, acute infection or advanced stages of

365

the disease could result in visible manifestations, leading to isolation and lack of

366

support from community members. Careful dissemination of accurate information on

367

HBV is required to prevent possible stigma and misperceptions of personal risk.

368
369

Studies from Asia have reported stigma and limited knowledge among health

370

practitioners as obstacles in the uptake of preventive, diagnostic and treatment

371

services among HBV patients (4,23). Delayed health seeking behaviour has been

372

widely reported in tuberculosis and is a result of several factors such as lack of

373

symptoms, low patient knowledge, practising self-medication, and the use of

374

traditional healing methods (24–26). In our study, the asymptomatic nature of HBV,

375

poverty and lack of knowledge (including among healthcare workers) were

376

challenges in accessing timely and appropriate healthcare (27). While there are

377

efforts to improve knowledge on HBV among healthcare professionals and

378

community members in Uganda, studies are needed to evaluate the evidence of

379

effectiveness of these interventions, and to evaluate availability, accessibility and

380

integration of HBV services.

381
382

Strength and limitations of this study

383

This is the first study to explore beliefs, understanding and stigma around HBV

384

infection in Uganda. A strength of the study was that we sampled participants from

385

both urban and rural settings, sampling men and women and including a diverse

386

range of ages which afforded a comparison for HBV description, experiences and

387

understanding. This approach provides some valuable reflections and insights into

388

local understanding and beliefs about HBV infection, but represents only a small

389

number of adults, who self-selected to participate.

390
391

Conclusions

392

Engaging local communities, understanding barriers, and providing appropriate and

393

accessible information will be a crucial undertaking if diagnosis, treatment and

394

preventive strategies are to be rolled out to support progress towards the 2030

395

sustainable development goal targets for elimination of HBV infection as a public

396

health threat. Although radio campaigns have raised some local awareness of HBV

397

in the communities we studied in Uganda, there remain significant gaps in

398

knowledge and understanding, and a risk of stigma associated with fear, especially

399

in the context of physical signs of liver disease. Educating traditional healers and

400

healthcare workers could have a positive impact on disseminating information.

401

Further studies are needed to investigate the societal responses to HBV infection in

402

other African populations, and to establish the best ways to engage with local

403

populations to promote access to interventions.
