Abstract
Background
Diagnostic categories within the psychosis spectrum are widely used in clinical
practice, however psychosis may occur on a continuum. Therefore, we explored
whether the continuous distribution of psychotic symptoms across categories is a
function of genetic as well as environmental risk factors, such as polygenic risk
scores (PRSs) and cannabis use.

Methods
As part of the EU-GEI study, we genotyped first episode psychosis patients (FEP)
and population controls, for whom transdiagnostic dimensions of psychotic
symptoms or experiences were generated using item response bi-factor modelling.
Linear regression was used, separately in patients and controls, to test the
associations between these dimensions and schizophrenia (SZ) PRSs, as well as
the combined effect of SZ-PRS and cannabis use on the positive
symptom/experience dimensions.
Results
SZ-PRS was associated with negative (B=0.18; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.34) and positive
(B=0.19; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36) symptom dimensions in 617 FEP, and with all the
psychotic experience dimensions in 979 controls. The putative effect of SZ-PRS on
either symptom or experience dimensions was of a small magnitude. Cannabis use
was additionally associated with the positive dimensions both in FEP (B=0.31;
95%CI 0.11 to 0.52) and in controls (B=0.26; 95%CI 0.06 to 0.46), independently
from SZ-PRS.
Conclusions
We report two validators to the latent dimensional structure of psychosis. SZ risk
variants and cannabis use independently map onto specific dimensions, contributing
to variation across the psychosis continuum. Findings support the hypothesis that
psychotic experiences have similar biological substrates as clinical disorders.

Introduction
Psychotic disorders are syndromes caused by multiple genetic and
socioenvironmental factors (1). However, the current classification system is based
on a ‘natural history approach’ rather than on a ‘natural classification’ (2).
Specifically, diagnostic categories of non-affective (e.g., schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorders) and affective (e.g., bipolar disorder, psychotic depression)
psychosis were developed from observed similarities and dissimilarities of signs and
symptoms over time, without considering biological or socio-environmental factors
(3). Hence, the question of whether current diagnostic categories are the most valid
phenotypes for research is still debated, due to the following methodological
limitations.

First, psychotic disorders are commonly studied as binary phenotypes (e.g.,
diagnosis yes/no), although psychotic symptoms follow a continuous distribution (4).
Furthermore, some authorities claim that the introduction of operationalised
classification systems in the 1970s led to the ‘death of phenomenology’ driving
biological psychiatry to focus on the presence/absence of a diagnosis whilst
overlooking the complex expression of psychotic phenomena (5).
Moreover, Kraepelin’s paradigm (i.e., the neat distinction between non-affective and
affective psychosis) has been challenged (6), though not yet replaced (3). As a
consequence, the high comorbidity indices among psychotic disorders (7), as well as
their high genetic correlation (8), may be an artefact of our own diagnostic
conceptualization.

To address these limitations, the use an approach based on symptom dimensions
has been proposed (9). Consistent with this methodology, we reported that
transdiagnostic psychopathology at first episode psychosis (FEP) can be
represented by a general psychosis factor (G), and five specific dimensions of
positive (POS), negative (NEG), disorganization (DIS), manic (MAN), and depressive
(DEP) symptoms (10). Similarly, a model composed of general and specific
experience dimensions has been proposed to measure subclinical psychosis in the
general population (11, 12). These conceptualizations statistically reflect a ‘bi-factor
model’, where the general and specific dimensions account, respectively, for the
unidimensional and multidimensional nature of the latent psychosis construct (13,
14). We have previously advocated that such structures should be validated by the
degree to which biological and environmental factors cohere with general and
specific symptom dimensions (10). Indeed, according to the coherence theory of
truth, psychiatric constructs can be approximated as true if they are well connected
and integrated into our accumulated scientific evidence (15).

Thus, we recently found evidence that cannabis-associated psychopathology at
psychosis onset is characterised by high POS scores and low NEG scores (16).
In relation to biological factors, symptom dimensions have been investigated in
family, twin and adoption studies (17-22), overall showing that NEG or DIS
symptoms had higher familial aggregation than other symptom dimensions.

In recent years the availability of summary statistics from large genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) across psychiatric phenotypes has allowed researchers
to test in independent samples how the genetic liability to a disorder predicts any
other traits (23). Genetic liability is commonly summarised into a polygenic risk score
(PRS) (24), however, only a few studies to date have investigated the relation
between SZ-PRS and psychotic symptom dimensions (25). In patients, an
association between SZ-PRS and NEG (or DIS) symptoms was found in several SZ
studies (26-28) and in Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) large megaanalyses (29, 30). However, other studies have not found the same pattern of
associations (31, 32), and only one study reported that SZ-PRS correlated with POS
symptoms (28). Interestingly, in the general population an association was observed
between SZ-PRS and either NEG (12, 33) or POS psychotic experiences (34-36);
however, negative findings have also been reported (37).

The inconsistency across studies could be explained by differences in study design,
methods, and GWAS power. Of note, only one small study examined a FEP sample
(38), in which confounding effects of antipsychotic drugs on symptoms are minimised
and a common comparable time point in the course of illness is used. In addition,
most studies have not performed factor analysis of observed symptoms to measure
and validate latent constructs. Finally, no studies have applied summary statistics
from recent PGC GWAS investigating similarities and dissimilarities between SZ and
BP (29).

We have previously reported findings from bi-factor models of 1) psychotic
symptoms in a multinational FEP sample (10) and 2) psychotic experiences in
controls representative of the population at risk in each catchment area (11). In the
current study, we aimed to investigate the association between these phenotypes
and genetic loading for SZ and BP, as summarised by i) SZ-PRS, ii) BP-PRS, iii)
combined SZ & BP- PRS. We further explored whether the previously reported
association of cannabis use with the POS dimensions (16) holds when taking into
account SZ-PRS.
Based on an a priori synopsis, we hypothesized that SZ-PRS would be positively
associated with the NEG dimension in FEP patients, and with the POS dimensions in
both FEP patients and the general population. Furthermore, we hypothesized a

cumulative effect of cannabis use on POS dimensions independent of SZ-PRS.
Finally, we expected in FEP, an association between BP-PRS and the MAN
symptom dimension, and between the combined SZ & BP- PRS and the G factor.
Methods and Materials
Sample design and procedures
FEP patients and population controls were recruited as part of the EUropean
network of national schizophrenia networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions
(EU-GEI). FEP patients were identified between 2010 and 2015 across six countries
to examine incidence rates of psychotic disorders and patterns of symptomatology
(10, 39). For examining biological and environmental risk factors, DNA samples were
collected, and an extensive face-to-face assessment was conducted on 1,130 FEP
and 1,497 controls, broadly representative of the population living in each catchment
area by age, sex and ethnic group. More information on recruitment strategies is
available in earlier EU-GEI incidence and case-control papers (39, 40).

Measures
Data on age, sex, and ethnicity were collected using a modified version of the
Medical Research Council Sociodemographic Schedule (41).
The OPerational CRITeria (OPCRIT) system (42) was used by centrally trained
investigators, whose reliability was assessed before and throughout the study
(k=0.7), to assess psychopathology experienced in the first four weeks after FEP
and define research-based diagnoses. Moreover, psychopathology assessment
included the use of the Schedule for Deficit Syndrome (SDS) (43) to evaluate NEG
symptoms, which are not extensively covered by the OPCRIT.
The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) (44) was administered
to population controls to report their positive, negative, and depressive psychotic
experiences.
A modified version of the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire (CEQEU-GEI) (45) was
used to collect extensive information on patterns of cannabis use.

Dimensions of psychotic symptoms and experiences

Data from OPCRIT and CAPE were analysed using item response modelling in
Mplus, version 7.4, to estimate two bifactor models of psychopathology, based on
the associations among observer ratings of psychotic symptoms in patients or selfrating of psychotic experiences in controls (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). This
methodology is described in full in earlier EU-GEI papers on transdiagnostic
dimensions (10, 11). Briefly, OPCRIT or CAPE items were dichotomized as 0
‘absent’ or 1 ‘present’, to estimate two bi-factor models, for patients and controls
respectively. Bi-factor solutions were compared with competitive solutions (i.e.,
unidimensional, multidimensional, hierarchical models of psychosis) using LogLikelihood (LL), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC), and Sample-size Adjusted BIC (SABIC) as model fit statistics. McDonald’s
omega (ω) (46), omega hierarchical (ωH) (46), and index H (47), were computed as
reliability and strength indices.
Data from SDS were analysed in Mplus, version 7.4, following the same procedure
as described above. We did not estimate a bi-factor model for SDS due to lack of
rationale for a G factor of negative symptoms. Instead, based on the structure of the
NEG construct (48) and previous factor analysis studies on SDS (49), we estimated
a multidimensional model of NEG symptoms composed of the two specific
dimensions of 1) ‘avolition’ and 2) (lack of) ‘emotional expressivity’. We considered
‘emotional expressivity’ as the most genuine phenotypic expression of primary
negative symptoms for subsequent analysis, as the behavioural manifestation of
‘avolition’ may partly overlap with depressive symptoms in a FEP sample. SDS was
not administered in one of the study sites, Verona, which was therefore not included
in the analysis of NEG symptoms.

Genotype procedure
The EU-GEI case-control sample was genotyped at the MRC Centre for
Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics in Cardiff (UK) using a custom Illumina
HumanCoreExome-24 BeadChip genotyping array covering 570,038 genetic
variants. Imputation was performed in the Michigan Imputation Server, using the
Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panel, with Eagle software for estimating
haplotype phase, and Minimac3 for genotype imputation (50-52). The imputed bestguess genotype was used for the present analysis.

Population stratification and polygenic risk score calculation
We performed a two-step procedure to account for the multi-ethnic nature of the
sample (reported in full in the supplementary material), by excluding populations in
our sample of very different ancestry from external GWAS data. Briefly, as a first
step, we identified in our sample ancestry clusters of individuals through iterative
pruning of principal component analysis (ipPCA) of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), and we tested for each cluster whether PRS discriminated cases from
controls. As a second step, we merged these clusters (based on whether PRS had
discriminative value), removed long-range genome regions with complex linkage
disequilibrium (LD) patterns, recalculated main Principal Components (PCs), and
finally constructed main PRSs using PRSice (53). Specifically, individuals’ risk
variants were weighted by the log(odds ratio), where the odds ratio was extracted
from the latest summary statistics of SZ and BP PGC mega-analyses (29, 54, 55),
which did not include any EU-GEI sample. Logistic regression was then applied to
predict case status from SZ- and BP-PRS, after covarying for 10 PCs, sex, age, and
primary diagnosis. Nagelkerke's R2 was used as a measure of the difference in
variance between the full-model versus a model with the covariates alone, at the
SNPs p-value threshold (PT)=0.05 (selected a priori as it maximised the explained
variance in case status in the PGC studies (54, 55)).

Relationship between symptom dimensions, polygenic risk scores, and cannabis use
We tested for associations between PRSs and the scores on transdiagnostic
dimensions of psychotic symptoms/experiences, separately in FEP and controls,
using linear regression.
Specifically, in FEP we tested for association between all symptom dimensions and
the three PRSs. In controls, we tested for association between all psychotic
experience dimensions and SZ-PRS; we did not test BP-related PRSs since
(hypo)manic experiences were not rated in our controls.
Moreover, we used predicted values of SZ-PRS after regression of case/control
status, to illustrate the continuous distribution of SZ-PRS in our sample according to
quartiles of positive psychotic experience and symptoms.
To examine the combined associations of cannabis use and SZ-PRS with POS
dimensions, we selected the two variables on pattern of cannabis use previously
associated with POS (11), i.e., ‘lifetime daily use’ in patients and ‘current use’ in

controls. We first checked for correlation with SZ-PRS, and subsequently we added
the two cannabis terms to the models.
Given the high number of outcomes (six dimensions in patients, four in controls) and
predictors (PRSs and cannabis use), and the number of hypotheses (four in patients,
one in controls), we controlled the false discovery rate using the Benjamini and
Hochberg procedure (56), tolerating a 10% false discovery rate (q=0.10).
Furthermore, as a sensitivity measure, in PRSice we tested whether the main effect
of PRSs on dimensions held at other PT and ran a permutation analysis to further
control the familywise error rate, by repeating the PRSice procedure shuffling the
phenotype 5,000 times to obtain an empirical distribution of the p-value at the best
PT. Finally, we used AVENGEME (Additive Variance Explained and Number of
Genetic Effects Method of Estimation) to further evaluate the consistency of the
effect directions across different PT and compute the genetic covariance (σ12)
between our symptom dimensions and the PGC GWAS data (57).
Results
Main PCs and PRS computation
Population stratification findings are presented in the supplement material. Based on
the case-control discriminative value of SZ- and BP-PRS in each population cluster,
we merged 1,596 individuals (617 FEP and 979 population controls) for SZ-PRS
analyses, and 505 FEP for BP-PRS analysis only. The ability of SZ and BP PRSs to
distinguish cases from controls in the main sample is presented in Figure 1, showing
that at PT=0.05, SZ-PRS accounted for a Nagelkerke's R2 of 0.09 (p=6.9x10-26); and
BP-PRS for a Nagelkerke's R2 of 0.02 (p=5x10-6).

Psychotic symptom dimensions by PRS in patients
Findings on symptom dimensions in cases by SZ-, BP-, and SZ & BP- PRSs at
PT=0.05 are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. As expected in PRS cross-trait
predictions (23), the magnitude of the SNPs effect was small for all the associations
detected. Specifically, SZ-PRS was associated with a high score for both the positive
(B=0.19, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.35; Nagelkerke's R2 =0.009, p=0.019) and negative
(B=0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.33; Nagelkerke's R2 =0.01, p=0.021) symptom
dimensions. Moreover, we found no nominal association between BP-PRS and the
MAN symptom dimension (B=0.09, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.19; Nagelkerke's R2 =0.008,

p=0.055); and between SZ & BP- PRS and the G factor (B=0.06, 95%CI -0.05 to
0.16; p=0.158).
Sensitivity analysis showed that the pattern of associations between SZ-PRS with
either POS or NEG symptom dimensions was consistently observed across all PT
and remained relevant even after permutation analysis (Figure S6 – supplement,
showing empirical p-values of 0.007 for POS; and of 0.055 for NEG). Furthermore, a
positive genetic covariance was observed between both NEG and PGC SZ GWAS
[σ12=0.56 (95%CI 0.39 to 0.76)] and POS and PGC SZ GWAS [σ12=0.51 (95%CI
0.35 to 0.69)].
Finally, the violin plots presented in Figure 2 illustrate the kernel distribution of
predicted value of SZ-PRS across individual quartiles of positive psychotic
symptoms.

Psychotic experience dimensions by SZ-PRS in controls
A positive association between SZ-PRS with a higher score at all psychotic
experience dimensions was found (Table 2). Sensitivity analysis showed that the
association between SZ-PRS with POS psychotic experiences was consistent
across different PT and remained relevant after permutation analysis (Figure S7 –
supplement, showing an empirical P-value = 0.003). The kernel distribution of
predicted value of SZ-PRS according to individual quartiles of psychotic experiences
in controls is reported in Figure 3.

POS symptom dimensions by PRS and cannabis use in patients and controls
Daily cannabis use (B=0.31; 95%CI 0.11 to 0.52; p=0.002) and SZ-PRS (B=0.22;
95%CI 0.04 to 0.39; p=0.014) were independently associated with POS symptoms in
patients, and this joint model improved fit over a model with SZ-PRS alone (LR
chi2(1)=6.10, p = 0.01).
Similar results were found for POS psychotic experiences in controls, with main
effects of current use of cannabis (B=0.26, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.46; p=0.011) and SZPRS (B=0.13, 95%CI 0.02 to 0.25; p=0.022) (Figure 4), and with an improvement of
model fit (LR chi2(1)=6.42, p = 0.01).

This is the first study to investigate the combined effect of SZ-PRS and cannabis use
on psychosis dimensions. We found that these two factors, independently from each
other, are associated with more clinical and sub-clinical POS symptoms in both FEP
patients and controls. Moreover, we found a relationship between SZ-PRS and more
NEG symptoms and experiences. Finally, we did not find in our sample an
association between BP-PRS and MAN symptoms; or between the combined SZ &
BP- PRS and the G factor.
Our findings provide first evidence that in patients and controls, the latent structure of
psychosis, as generated using a statistically guided approach, is valid and coheres
with both SZ risk variants and cannabis use. However, any further interpretation on
the applicability of these findings should take into account the small magnitude of all
the detected associations.

Comparison with previous research
Our findings extend those from previous research on the validity of psychosis
symptom dimensions by ascertaining their coherence with genetic factors and
cannabis use. First, under the hypothesis that psychosis symptom presentation is
partly a function of SZ genetic liability, we reported an association between SZ-PRS
and both POS and NEG symptom dimensions. This in line with a meta-analysis
suggesting that different SZ risk loci impact on SZ clinical heterogeneity, e.g. genes
related to immune system might be overrepresented for NEG, and genes related to
addiction and dopamine-synapses might be overrepresented for POS (58).
Familial co-aggregation of NEG symptoms was reported in the Danish adoption
study (19), in the Roscommon family study (59), in the Maudsley twin series studies
(18). Genome-wide suggestive linkages with an effect on NEG symptoms have also
been reported, although without reaching a significance threshold (60, 61). GWAS
and PRS examinations provide good evidence of a polygenic signal for NEG (26-30).
Altogether, these studies provide converging evidence that NEG has substantive
heritability at least partly due to cumulative schizophrenia risk loci. The DIS
dimension has also been reported as having high heritability in some studies (20),
but we found no evidence of its association with SZ-PRS in our FEP sample, and we
could not examine this latent construct in our controls. Speculatively, it is possible
that DIS symptom differ in their lifetime v. FEP prevalence, or that genetic loci
influencing DIS are different from those carrying SZ risk (20).

Second, our results on the relationship between SZ-PRS and POS are intriguing but
less consistent with previous literature. Possible familial co-aggregation of POS
symptoms was rarely reported (62, 63). However, a previous study observed that BP
patients with higher SZ-PRS presented with more mood-incongruent POS symptoms
(64), which suggests SZ-PRS has a POS modifier effect. Nevertheless, this was not
confirmed by meta-analysis of PGC and GPC samples (30, 65). We may consider in
interpreting our data, that the EU-GEI sample included FEP patients only, hence
symptomatology rating was not confounded by antipsychotic treatment; whereas
PGC and GPC samples are most chronic schizophrenia samples, where the
enduring antipsychotic treatment can attenuate POS symptoms and increase NEG
symptoms (i.e., secondary NEG symptoms). Moreover, various environmental
factors impacting at different levels on dopaminergic activity makes it difficult to
disentangle the risk variants contribution to POS symptoms over the course of SZ.
From this perspective, we extend previous evidence that use of cannabis is
associated with more POS symptomatology at FEP (11, 66), clarifying that this
association is independent from SZ genetic risk loading.

Third, unlike our hypothesis and larger studies (29, 67), we did not report an
association between BP-PRS and MAN. This may suggest that our sample is too
small for BP-PRSs based on GWAS than SZ, or the true effect of BP-PRS is too
small.

Fourth, we replicated in our controls the same patterns of associations as in cases
between SZ-PRS and dimensions, but in the form of sub-clinical psychosis. Further,
we provide novel evidence that SZ-PRS and current cannabis use are both
associated with more POS psychotic experiences. It has been debated whether subclinical psychotic symptoms have an etiological overlap with full-blown psychosis.
Our findings support the evidence that SZ-PRS correlates with psychotic
experiences (35), which in adults may be reflecting similarities with biological SZ risk
factors (35). Moreover, a few SNPs reaching genome-wide significance have been
recently identified for psychotic experiences, for example in CNR2, coding for the
cannabinoid receptor type 2 (68). This suggests that further studies are needed to

clarify the relationship between patterns of cannabis use and sets of genes
potentially enhancing its psychotropic effects (69).

Finally, to our knowledge this is the first study examining SZ & BP- PRS and G factor
in psychotic disorders, under the hypothesis they have a positive correlation. We
report a negative finding which may be explained by G not properly reflecting general
psychopathology in our FEP sample. On other hand, the G factor of psychotic
experiences in controls well correlated with SZ genetic liability.

Limitations
The following limitations suggest exercising caution when interpreting our findings.
1) We performed extensive work for defining the fine-scale population structure in a
multi-ethnic sample. Certainly, having a sample of individuals from a single
homogenous population would have improved the quality of the analysis, however
our study has the advantage of being more representative of the real clinical
practice. Most important, we included as far as possible population clusters not
located in Europe but still suitable for PRS analyses, which is in line with a more
general aim of not contributing to healthy disparities (70).
2) Regarding symptom ratings in patients, we used symptom dimensions from two
different scales, i.e. NEG from SDS, and the other symptom dimensions from
OPCRIT. In the EU-GEI study, negative symptoms were rated through the
administration of SDS; moreover, exploratory factor analyses of OPCRIT in other
samples showed that a hybrid DIS/NEG dimension was often obtained rather than
discrete NEG and DIS dimensions (30, 71). Of note, our preliminary analysis of
SZ-PRS and NEG using OPCRIT showed no nominal association (72), due,
possibly, to the scarce item covariance coverage, acknowledged as a limitation in
our earlier paper on symptom dimensions (10).
3) Regarding the bifactor solutions, G may be difficult to interpret and possibly
overfits the data (73). Nevertheless, in our model, G improves the measurement
of specific dimensions by making their score not unduly affected by the all-item
covariance (10). Moreover, based on the strength of item factor loadings in our
sample, G could be interpreted: 1) in patients, as combined manic-delusional

symptomatology (10); 2) in controls, as a combined measure of all types of
psychotic experiences (11).
4) We did not validate self-reported information on current use of cannabis with
biological samples. However, this method does not allow ascertaining lifetime
patterns of cannabis use (40) and is not considered a gold standard method (74).
Moreover, it has been shown that self-report information on cannabis use is
consistent with laboratory data (75).
5) We did not use a PRS based on GWAS of symptom dimensions, as this is
currently unavailable. It is noteworthy that, genes conferring risk to a disorder
(‘risk genes’) may not overlap with genes modifying symptom presentation
(‘modifier genes’) (76), although it is hypothesised that there are genes with a
mixed effect (58). Thus, our study answers the question whether the genetic
liability for psychotic disorder explains variance of some phenotypic traits, without
accounting for other possible genetic sources of that variance (i.e., the
contribution of modifier genes, copy number variants, and rare SNPs).

Implications
Most clinical and research psychiatrists still embrace Kraepelin’s nosology in the field
of psychosis, despite the fact that for a century concerns have been raised related to
the absence of converging validators to distinguish non-affective and affective
psychotic disorders (77). We report two classes of external validators of
transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, such as SZ-PRS and cannabis use. It should
be born in mind that pharmacological and psychological interventions, as well as
cannabis cessation and all secondary prevention strategies target particular
symptoms more than the general diagnosis. Hence, our findings support the concept
of a psychosis continuum.

Figure 4 – POS dimensions by SZ-PRS and cannabis use in controls
The graph presents the predicted POS symptom dimension scores at two different covariate values
(cannabis use yes/no), holding SZ-PRS at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Predicted values were
adjusted for age, sex, and 10 ancestry PCs.
