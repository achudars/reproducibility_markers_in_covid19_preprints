ABSTRACT
The changes of cortical structure in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia
(FTD) are usually described in terms of atrophy. However, neurodegenerative diseases may
also affect the complexity of cortical shape, such as the fractal dimension of the brain surface.
Thirty-two people with symptomatic AD-pathology (clinically probable AD, n=18, and
amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment, n=14), 24 with FTD and 28 healthy controls
underwent high-resolution 3T structural brain MRI. Using surface-based morphometry, we
created vertex-wise cortical thickness and fractal dimension maps for group comparisons and
correlations with cognitive measures in AD and FTD. In addition to the well-established
pattern of cortical thinning encompassing temporoparietal regions in AD and frontotemporal
areas in FTD (FDR p< 0.05), we observed reductions of fractal dimension specifically
involving precuneus and posterior cingulate for AD and orbitofrontal cortex and insula for
FTD. Correlational analyses between fractal dimension and cognition showed that these
regions were particularly vulnerable with regards to memory and language impairment in both
AD and FTD. This study demonstrates a distinct pattern of fractal dimension impairment and
correlation with cognition. Further studies are required to assess cortical complexity measures
at earlier disease stages (e.g. in prodromal/ asymptomatic carriers of FTD-related gene
mutations) to assess whether fractal dimension represents a sensitive imaging marker for
prevention and diagnostic strategies.

1. INTRODUCTION
Considering the expected dramatic increase of patients affected by dementia and the
anticipated costs to the society, efficient prevention strategies – including early imaging
markers - are paramount to tackle this major socioeconomic issue. Late-onset Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) accounts for more than half of the cases of dementia (Barker et al., 2002) and is
characterized by episodic memory impairment in association with executive dysfunctions and
visuospatial disturbances (Greene, Hodges, & Baddeley, 1995; Hodges et al., 1999), reflecting
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles deposition in medial temporal and parietal regions
(Braak, Thal, Ghebremedhin, & Del Tredici, 2011). While frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is
less frequent in the older-age population, its prevalence has been reported as similar to AD in
patients aged 45-64 (Ratnavalli, Brayne, Dawson, & Hodges, 2002). FTD encompasses a
group of clinical syndromes characterized by behavioural and language changes, due to
degeneration in frontal and temporal lobes, with pathologic diagnosis based on abnormal
accumulation of three major proteins: microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, 40%), TAR
DNA-binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43, 50%) and fused in sarcoma protein (FUS, 10%).
FTD includes a behavioural variant (bvFTD) and a primary progressive aphasia (PPA) further
divided in a semantic variant (svPPA) and non-fluent type (nfPPA) (Gorno-Tempini et al.,
2011; Rascovsky et al., 2011).
Structural MRI imaging studies have identified a distinct pattern of grey matter (GM) atrophy
and cortical thinning in AD and FTD (Du et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2006). While medial
temporal and parietal lobes are primarily involved in AD, FTD is characterized by cortical
thinning that encompasses the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. The FTD subtypes also
exhibit anatomical alterations in distinct regional pattern, with cortical thinning more
specifically involving the orbitofrontal cortex in bvFTD (Moller et al., 2016), the left anterior
temporal cortex in svPPA (Routier et al., 2018) and the inferior frontal gyrus in nfPPA

(Agosta et al., 2015). These neuroanatomical patterns also adhere to the clinical syndromes
and partly explain the the characteristic clinical and neuropsychological features of each
variant.
In addition to cortical thickness, other surface-based morphometry (SBM) indices can
characterize cortical folding patterns. One measure is the local gyrification index, defined as
the ratio between the inner surface size to the outer surface size of a convex hull. However,
this measure suffers from several drawbacks, including between-subject brain size differences
normalization and noise in surface reconstruction (Lopes & Betrouni, 2009). Another recently
introduced measure of cortical complexity is the fractal dimension, which does not rely on
defining an explicit outer hull and thus avoiding the possible confounds encountered when
estimating local gyrification index. Based on the idea that the brain structure can be
mathematically described as a fractal (Kiselev, Hahn, & Auer, 2003), fractal dimension can be
used to measure cortical folding complexity, even at the vertex level (Yotter, Nenadic,
Ziegler, Thompson, & Gaser, 2011). Recent studies have shown significant differences of
regional fractal dimension in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions,
including schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis (Esteban et al., 2007; Narr et al., 2004). In AD
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), reduction in fractal dimensino has been observed in the
insula, medial temporal lobe and cingulate cortex (Ruiz de Miras et al., 2017). In addition,
Sheelakumari et al. showed that the whole brain fractal dimension was reduced in behavioural
and aphasic variants of FTD compared to controls (Sheelakumari et al., 2018). However, the
vertex-wise regional pattern of fractal dimension reductions in FTD has remained largely
unknown. Moreover, whereas fractal dimension reduction in AD was related to global
cognitive impairment according to the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive
(ADAS-cog) scale (King et al., 2010), the correlation between cortical complexity analysis
and specific cognitive subdomains has not yet been evaluated.

In this study, we aimed at assessing the regional patterns of cortical thickness and fractal
dimension changes in a cross-sectional cohort of patients with AD and FTD. We hypothesized
that, in addition to the previously described cortical thinning encompassing the
temporoparietal areas in AD and frontotemporal regions in FTD (Du et al., 2007; Moller et
al., 2016; Singh et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009), the two disease groups would exhibit a
distinct pattern of fractal dimension reduction. Based on a previous study (Ruiz de Miras et
al., 2017), we expected AD subjects to show a reduced fractal dimension in medial temporal
regions. As the pattern of altered fractal dimension in AD broadly follows that of cortical
thinning, we hypothesized that FTD would present a fractal dimension reduction in diseasespecific regions, including the “epicentre” of pathogenesis in the insula (Seeley, 2010) and
orbitofrontal cortex.

2. METHODS
2.1 Participants
The present study is part of the Neuroimaging of Inflammation in MemoRy and Other
Disorders (NIMROD) protocol (Bevan-Jones et al., 2017). We included 18 participants with
clinically probable AD according to McKhann’s criteria (McKhann et al., 2011), in addition
to 14 patients with MCI defined by a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score > 24/30,
memory impairment at least 1.5 standard deviation (SD) below that expected for age and
education, and in vivo evidence of amyloid pathology (positive

C-Pittsburgh compound B

(PiB) PET imaging). AD and MCI patients were combined on the basis that these two
subgroups represent a clinical continuum of the same pathological spectrum.
We also included 24 patients with FTD (8 bvFTD, 9 svPPA and 7 nfPPA) diagnosed
according to published consensus criteria (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Rascovsky et al.,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013466; this version posted December 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

2011). Twenty-eight similarly aged healthy participants were recruited as controls, with
MMSE >26/30, absence of regular memory complaints, and no history of major neurological,
psychiatric or significant medical illness. Patients were identified from the memory clinic at
the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. Controls were recruited via the Dementias
and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRON) volunteer register.
Informed written consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The
study received a favourable opinion from the East of England Ethics Committee (Cambridge
Central Research, Ref. 13/EE/0104). Clinical and cognitive assessment included Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) and revised Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE-R)
(Mioshi, Dawson, Mitchell, Arnold, & Hodges, 2006).

2.2 MRI acquisition and preprocessing
Participants underwent MRI imaging acquired on a 3T scanner (Siemens Magnetom Tim
Trio) using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) T1-weighted sequence
with the following parameters: repetition time = 2300 ms, echo time = 2.98 ms, field of view
= 240 x 256 mm2, 176 slices, flip angle = 9°, isotropic 1mm3 voxels.
Surface-based morphometry (SBM) analyses were performed using the Computational
Anatomy Toolbox 12 (CAT12, Structural Brain Imaging Group, University of Jena,
Germany) in Matlab R2019a version 9.6 (MathWorks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA). Cortical
thickness and central surface of the left and right hemispheres were assessed using a
projection-based thickness method (Dahnke, Yotter, & Gaser, 2013). Using a tissue
segmentation to estimate the white matter distance, the software projects the local maxima
(which is equal to the cortical thickness) to other GM voxels by using a neighbour
relationship described by the white matter distance. Projection-based thickness allows the
handling of partial volume information, sulcal blurring, and sulcal asymmetries without

explicit sulcus reconstruction (Dahnke et al., 2013), which results in a significant reduction of
processing time compared to other SBM softwares. Topological correction, spherical mapping
and spherical registration are performed in order to obtain vertex-wise cortical thickness.
Surface maps were smoothed using a 15mm-full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) kernel.
Similarly, CAT12 can extract FD values at the global (whole-brain), regional (based on
regions of interest of an atlas) and local (vertex) level, based on a spherical harmonic
reconstruction method described in a previous study (Yotter et al., 2011). At variance with the
box-counting approach, spherical harmonic reconstruction allows to maintain an identical
number of vertices for all reconstructed surfaces, which reduces the influence of individual
vertex alignment, resampling and interpolation, resulting in more accurate reconstructions
(Yotter et al., 2011). After obtaining individual vertex-wise fractal dimension maps,
smoothing was performed with a 20mm-FWHM kernel as recommended by CAT12.
Labelling of the significant regions of interest determined in group comparisons and
correlations was based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas included in the CAT12 SBM toolbox.

2.3 Statistical analyses
Demographic data were analyzed with Stata software Version 14.2 (College Station, TX).
Assessment of distribution for continuous variables was performed with Shapiro–Wilk test
and visualization of histogram plots, followed by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test, and post
hoc Tukey/Dunn test, accordingly. Categorical variables were compared with Chi-squared
test. Statistical significance was considered when p < 0.05.
Global (whole-brain) cortical thickness and fractal dimension values were calculated for each
group, and correlation between cortical thickness and fractal dimension were performed with
Pearson correlation. Between-group local (vertex-wise) cortical thickness and fractal
dimension comparisons were performed in CAT12 with a 2-sample t-test using age as

covariate. Vertex-wise correlations between SBM maps and ACE-R cognitive subscores were
performed using multiple regressions with age as covariate. A significant statistical threshold
of false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p < 0.05 was considered for all vertex-wise analyses.
We also report exploratory results at p < 0.001 uncorrected.

3. RESULTS
3.1 Demographics
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with AD, FTD and control participants
are shown in Table 1. A difference in age was observed (p = 0.01, ANOVA), with FTD
patients being significantly younger than AD patients (p = 0.01, post hoc Tukey test), as
expected on the basis of the demographic characteristics of these neurodegenerative disorders.
Gender distribution and education attainment were similar across groups, whereas, as
expected, MMSE and ACE-R scores were significantly lower in the AD and FTD groups
compared to Controls (p<0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Dunn test). Each of the five
ACE-R cognitive subdomains was assessed separately for AD and FTD (including its
variants). A significant impairment was considered when the mean group subscore was < 80%
of the total maximal subscore. While AD showed an impairment in memory and fluency, FTD
group including its variants had a significant degree of impairment in language over and
above memory and verbal fluency impairment. Attention/orientation and visuospatial
subscores were only mildly reduced in both dementia groups (mean subscores > 80%), and
therefore were not used for further analyses of clinical-imaging correlations.

3.2 Cortical thickness/FD group comparisons

As shown in Table 1, whole-brain cortical thickness and fractal dimension values were
significantly lower in AD and FTD relative to controls (p<0.001, ANOVA with all post hoc
Tukey test p<0.001). There was also a significant positive correlation between mean cortical
thickness and mean fractal dimension (rho = 0.30, p < 0.006, Pearson correlation).
Vertex-wise cortical thickness group comparisons showed that AD subjects had significant
cortical thinning in extensive frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, while FTD
patients exhibited cortical thickness reduction mainly in frontal and anterior temporal regions
(FDR p < 0.05). Analyses in FTD subgroups revealed that the superior frontal cortex was
particularly affected in bvFTD and nfPPA, whereas the left anterior temporal regions were
more severely affected in svPPA (all FDR p < 0.05) (Figure 1).
We also observed decreased fractal dimension for both AD and FTD relative to controls.
More specifically, AD showed reduced fractal dimension in the bilateral insula and
supramarginal gyrus, left middle frontal, superior temporal, inferior temporal, and right
parahippocampal gyri. FTD patients had reduced fractal dimension in the bilateral insula,
middle and inferior frontal, orbitofrontal, as well as left superior parietal, supramarginal and
pericalcarine gyri (all FDR p < 0.05). Its variants showed a variable degree of fractal
dimension reduction in the insula, orbitofrontal and middle frontal regions (p<0.001) (Figure
2). At a more liberal threshold (uncorrected p < 0.001), increased fractal dimension was
observed in the anterior frontal regions in AD and lateral temporal areas in FTD.
Comparisons between AD and FTD revealed decreased cortical thickness for AD in posterior
cingulate, parietal and occipital regions, while FTD had cortical thinning in anterior temporal
cortices (p<0.001). A significant fractal dimension reduction was observed in the left
posterior cingulate and precuneus for AD, while FTD patients had decreased fractal
dimension in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and left insula (p<0.001) (Figure 3).

3.3 Vertex-wise correlation of cortical complexity measures and cognition
Memory impairment was correlated with cortical thinning in the left parahippocampal gyrus
in AD subjects and in more extensive regions for FTD, including left entorhinal and
parahippocampal, left fusiform, posterior cingulate and precuneus, as well as right superior
temporal cortex (p < 0.001, uncorrected). Language impairment was associated with a
reduced cortical thickness for FTD in left fusiform, superior and inferior temporal, and insula
(p < 0.001, uncorrected). No significant correlation was observed in AD for language
impairment, as well as for cortical thickness/fluency anatomical correlates in either AD or
FTD (Figure 4, left-hand side).
Memory impairment was associated with reduced fractal dimension in left middle temporal,
inferior temporal, precuneus and medial orbitofrontal for AD and left medial orbitofrontal for
FTD, while poor performance in the language subdomain correlated with decreased fractal
dimension in the left middle temporal and right lateral orbitofrontal cortices for AD, and in
left insula, inferior temporal, posterior cingulate, lingual and parahippocampal gyri regarding
FTD. Finally, decreased fluency was associated with reduced fractal dimension in the right
superior parietal gyrus in FTD (all p < 0.001, uncorrected), without any significant correlation
regarding AD (Figure 4, right-hand side).

4. DISCUSSION
Neurodegeneration changes cortical complexity. This study demonstrates that the fractal
dimension of cortical complexity is a promising imaging tool to assess specific morphological

patterns of grey matter damage in degenerative conditions, namely AD and FTD. The fractal
dimension in disease-related regions was also related to the severity of cognitive impairment.
We confirmed the typical cortical thinning signature of both AD (temporoparietal regions)
and FTD (frontal and anterior temporal regions). In addition, these two conditions have
distinct features regarding fractal dimension: whereas both AD and FTD have a variable
reduction of fractal dimension in the middle frontal cortex and supramarginal gyrus compared
to controls, direct comparisons between groups revealed that precuneus and posterior
cingulate regions were particularly vulnerable in AD, while orbitofrontal gyrus and insula
showed a more pronounced fractal dimension reduction for FTD subjects. Recently, Ruiz de
Miras et al. showed that white matter fractal dimension (but not pial surface fractal
dimension) was reduced for AD subjects in medial temporal lobe, insula and posterior
cingulate (Ruiz de Miras et al., 2017). Using a similar spherical harmonic reconstruction
proposed by Yotter (Yotter et al., 2011) natively embedded in the CAT12 toolbox, we were
able to observe similar regional changes at the cortical level.
Our identification of vertex-wise changes in fractal dimensionality for FTD differs from
Sheelakumari et al. who found a decrease in fractal dimension at the whole-brain and
hemispheric level: a decrease in the general fractal structure was observed for bvFTD, while
PPA subjects had more prominent impairment in the left hemisphere. We found that FTD had
reduced fractal dimension in the insula, middle and inferior frontal, orbitofrontal and posterior
regions compared to controls. In addition, we repeated these analyses for the different FTD
variants and observed that inferior frontal and insula were impaired in all groups. bvFTD and
svPPA variants showed fractal dimension reductions in orbitofrontal areas, while only svPPA
had a decreased fractal dimension in (mostly left) parahippocampal cortex. These findings
support the insula as being a major hub in speech production and socio-emotional functioning
(Mandelli et al., 2016; Seeley, 2010).

When comparing the SBM maps of AD/FTD patients with controls, we observed that cortical
thickness represented a more sensitive measure to detect cortical changes in dementia. In fact,
large clusters of cortical areas showing a decreased cortical thickness in AD and FTD were
observed (Figure 1), while fractal dimension changes were mostly localised in limbic and
cingulate areas (Figure 2).
One explanation could be that fractal dimension can decrease or increase in degenerative
conditions according to how the structural impairment involves the pial surface. In fact, a
change in the pial surface decreasing the folding area would more likely decrease complexity.
Conversely, if the change involves an increase in sulcal depth, the complexity (and thus
fractal dimension) would increase. While alterations in both directions were observed by King
et al. (King et al., 2010) using whole-brain fractal dimension analyses, we failed to observe a
significant increase in the two dementia groups with a FDR-corrected threshold.
While our study suggests that fractal dimension is a less sensitive structural marker in
comparison to cortical thickness, we observed that the cortical complexity changes in fractal
dimensionality correlated well with cognitive subdomains impaired in AD and FTD. In fact,
while memory impairment was mainly associated with cortical thinning in parahippocampal
regions, we observed additional correlational features for fractal dimension, e.g. a reduction in
orbitofrontal cortex in both AD and FTD (Figures 3-4). These findings add credence to the
hypothesis that orbitofrontal area, whose rostral region is primarily linked to medial temporal
limbic structures, plays a major role in memory encoding (Duarte, Henson, Knight, Emery, &
Graham, 2010; Frey & Petrides, 2000).
The study has several limitations. First, its cross-sectional design impeded further analyses
regarding how cortical complexity evolves longitudinally. In addition, we enrolled FTD
subjects at the dementia stage, while the AD group included patients with clinically probable
AD as well as MCI with biomarker evidence of amyloid pathology. Further studies should

assess fractal dimension changes in earlier cases, e.g. presymptomatic mutation carriers,
especially in FTD. This would test whether MRI-based fractal dimension is a sensitive
measure to detect early cortical alterations. Finally, our FTD subtype analysis had small group
sizes, limiting power, although the significant results were convergent in the insula across the
different subtypes.
This study has identified the impact of AD and FTD pathologies on cortical patterns of fractal
dimensionality. Further work will determine when these changes emerge and how quickly
they progress, in relation to other biomarkers, and in relation to the cellular and molecular
features of neurodegenerative diseases.
