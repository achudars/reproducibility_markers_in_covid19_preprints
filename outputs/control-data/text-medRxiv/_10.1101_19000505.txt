Abstract

19

Background

20

Early childhood respiratory and diarrheal infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality

21

worldwide. There is a need to further assess the epidemiology through prospective and

22

community-based studies to gain key insights that could inform preventative measures to reduce

23

the risk of infectious disease in this vulnerable population. We aimed to analyze the burden and

24

determinants of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea episodes affecting infants during

25

their first 2 years of life with state-of-the-art molecular technologies.

26

Methods

27

The ARI and diarrhea episodes were prospectively collected in a community-based, longitudinal

28

cohort of infants (n=267) from birth to 2 years of life in Bangladesh. Women were recruited during

29

the third trimester of pregnancy. Demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information on

30

the households was recorded. Nasopharyngeal and fecal samples were collected during regular

31

scheduled visits from mother-infant pairs, and also from the infants during unscheduled visits for

32

reported illnesses. New generation sequencing methods will be utilized to determine microbiota

33

composition and function, supplemented by the state-of-the-art multiplex molecular detection

34

technology for a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens.

35

Discussion

36

This study sought to assess the epidemiology of both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses

37

during the first 2 years of life in children from a peri-urban community of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

38

Characteristics of the mothers, as well as birth characteristics of infants enrolled in the Microbiota

39

and Health Study are presented here. We will determine any potential association between

microbiota composition and the abovementioned illnesses, and also examine the influence of

known and hypothesized risk factors on the occurrence of infections. Such putative factors include

environmental, socioeconomic, maternal, clinical, and selected genetic factors, namely the

variation of the fucosyltransferase genes (FUT2 and FUT3) of mothers and infants. This study will

add to current knowledge about these early childhood infectious diseases, and will provide data to

45

generate hypotheses for the development of nutritional approaches to be used as prevention

strategies.

52

Background

53

Despite notable progress made towards improving child health in the past several decades (1, 2)

54

infectious diseases remain highly prevalent, with respiratory and diarrheal infections representing

55

the highest burden (3). Worldwide in 2016, diarrhea and pneumonia caused over 1.4 million

56

deaths, and approximately 80% of these deaths occurred in children under the age of two (2). Non-

57

specific preventive measures, such as nutrition interventions and strategies to improve water,

58

sanitation, and hygiene have resulted in a large decline in diarrhea in children under five years of

59

age (4). However, this decrease was less pronounced for acute respiratory infections (ARI) (5)

60

especially in low resource settings, leading to increased importance of ARI morbidity and

61

mortality relative to diarrhea. The worldwide estimates of ARI prevalence vary widely. According

62

to the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) in low and middle-income countries, the percentage of

63

reported cases of ARI symptoms in two weeks prior to the survey in children under age of five

64

were as high as 10.0% in Haiti in 2015-2016; 5.4% in Bangladesh in 2014 and as low as 1.4% in

65

Armenia in 2015-16 (6). It has to be noted that the comparisons among countries are challenging,

66

mainly due to seasonality and the fact that DHS data are not available for the same years for all

67

the locations.

68

Understandably, the majority of efforts are focused on lower respiratory tract infections (7),

69

because of their high morbidity. Yet milder upper respiratory tract infections are approximately

70

ten-fold more frequent (8, 9), thus representing substantial burden. Approximately two thirds of

71

children below five years of age hospitalized in Bangladesh suffered from respiratory disorders.

72

Economic costs of ARI episodes in lower income countries is high relative to the median per capita

73

income. For example, a multi-site study in Northern India showed that among children aged under

74

five years, the median direct cost of ARI represented over 5% or 10% of the family annual median

75

income depending if treated in public or private institutions respectively (10). Moreover, these

76

estimates do not take into account the burden of increased risk of later health problems. For

77

example, bronchiolitis in infancy was associated with increased prevalence of recurrent wheeze,

78

asthma and allergy in early adulthood (11, 12).

79

Environmental risk factors for respiratory infections are well recognized, however the attributable

80

fraction of variation is small (below 10%) [e.g. (9)], indicating that identification of other factors

81

responsible for the differential susceptibility to respiratory infections is needed to optimize efforts

82

aimed at prevention and treatment of ARI (2, 5). Emerging evidence indicates that commensal

83

respiratory microbiota is an important modulator of susceptibility to respiratory infections (13, 14)

84

as well as wheezing and asthma later in life (15). The commensal microbes could interact with

85

respiratory pathogens in nasopharynx and modulate their infective potential (16, 17). It is also

86

plausible that the respiratory microbiota play key roles in the immune maturation and maintenance

87

of homeostasis as observed for gut commensals and thus impact respiratory health (16, 18).

88

Interestingly, respiratory infections may negatively impact gut health indicating that so called gut-

89

lung axis is bi-directional (19, 20). For example, in a model of acute influenza, airway disease

90

affected the intestinal microbiota, resulting in higher susceptibility to bacterial pathogen invasion

91

(21). Clinically, respiratory infections and diarrhea are often linked (22), suggesting the

92

importance of investigating the two simultaneously (23).

93

To gain insights into the risk factors of ARI and diarrhea, we have conducted a prospective

94

longitudinal study in Nandipara, a peri-urban community in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We have

95

evaluated the role of both gastrointestinal and respiratory microbiota, including facultative

96

pathogens, in susceptibility to ARI and diarrhea during the first two years of life. In addition, we

102

Study objectives

103

We conducted a prospective, population-based, longitudinal birth cohort study to evaluate the

104

association between the microbiota (nasopharyngeal and stool) and the occurrence of respiratory

105

and gastrointestinal infections in infants during their first two years of life. To this end, we

106

surveyed the occurrence of respiratory infections and investigated the nasopharyngeal microbiota,

107

as well as presence of respiratory pathogens. To address the same question in relation to diarrhea,

108

we set out to determine the association between stool microbiota, intestinal inflammation

109

biomarkers, presence of specific intestinal pathogens, and occurrence of diarrhea. A closely linked

110

objective was to determine the influence of other factors on the risk of infections, such as

111

environmental, maternal and specific genetic factors, namely the variation of the

112

fucosyltransferase genes (FUT2 and FUT3) of mothers and infants.

113
114

Study location

115

The study was conducted in Nandipara, a peri-urban community of Dhaka, the capital and largest

116

city in Bangladesh (Figure 1). The region experiences a subtropical monsoon climate

117

characterized by moderately warm temperatures (monthly average within 23 to 34°C during our

118

trial) (24), high humidity (38 to 87%) and wide seasonal variations in rainfall, in three distinct

119

seasons: a cool dry winter (November-February), a pre-monsoon hot season (March-May), and a

120

rainy monsoon (June-October) (25). The crude birth rate in urban area is 20.8 per 1000 population

121

(26). The community of Nandipara was chosen for its close proximity (~8 km) to the International

122

Center for Diarrheal Disease Research (icddr,b) campus, and presence of an iccdr,b-run health

123

outpost with experience in supporting research activities [e.g. (27)]. Nandipara covers an area of

124

around 4.5 km2 and with population density of 11500 per km2 (Dr Sarker, unpublished 2016

125

survey). All study participants lived within 4 km distance from the health outpost.

126
127

Study participants

128

Recruitment occurred from April 2013 to October 2014; the newborn infants were followed until

129

two years of age (i.e. until October 2016). Antenatal enrolment of women and follow-up of the

130

study infants are shown in Figure 2. Pregnant women (between 16 to 28 weeks of gestation) were

131

identified by house-to-house visits and at the icddr,b community clinic by trained field health

132

workers and 300 women were screened. Women who fulfilled the eligibility criteria and signed

133

the informed written consent (n=285) were enrolled at 32 ± 1 weeks of gestation. Gestational age

134

and parity of current pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasonography. For enrolment, pregnant

135

women needed to be inhabitants of Nandipara, between 18-35 years, with any parity but with

136

history of healthy and uncomplicated pregnancy, and having current singleton pregnancy, healthy

137

and uneventful progression of pregnancy and expected to have a normal pregnancy related

138

outcome. Exclusion criteria included Rhesus negative blood group; body mass index (BMI) of less

139

than 18.5 or more than 35, history of diabetes, hypertension; and antibiotic treatment within 3

140

weeks prior to this study.

Data collection

144

Data and sample collection were performed by the team consisting of health workers, research

145

assistants and study nurse supervised by a physician. Demographic, socioeconomic, environmental

146

and mother’s health characteristics were documented via personal interview using a pre-designed

147

epidemiological questionnaire comparable to the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey

148

(BDHS). Household and mother characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 and

149

Table 2, and birth characteristics of the infants in Table 3. Infant anthropometric data and feeding

150

practice (exclusivity of breastfeeding and introduction of complementary foods) were recorded at

151

scheduled visits, which were done at one month of age and subsequently every two months during

152

the first year of life, and then quarterly, at 15, 18 and 24 months of age. Weight was recorded using

153

digital weighting scale nearest 10 g (Seca, United Kingdom) and the length was measured with a

154

manual length board to the nearest 1 cm (icddr,b-designed and validated). Mid upper arm

155

circumference (MUAC) was recorded with a standard tape measure to the nearest 0.1 cm. In

156

addition to the regular scheduled visits, weekly home visits were done by the study nurse

157

supervised by a physician for the active surveillance of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.

158

Furthermore, mothers were asked to contact the nurse whenever her infant experienced symptoms

159

like cough, running/blocked nose, fever, ear discharge, rapid breathing or refusal of feeding, or

160

passage of loose stool. In such events, extra home visit was performed at the home, or mother was

161

asked to present herself and the child to the health outpost. Each ARI symptoms were recorded as

162

adverse events (AE) with the precise starting and ending dates. Concomitant medications

163

(including antibiotic treatment), AE and serious adverse events (SAE) were documented in a

164

standard electronic case report form by the medical officer.

Case definitions

167

An episode of ARI was defined as a period with one or more of the following ARI symptoms:

168

cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, ear discharge, rapid breathing or refusal of feeding. In line

169

with other studies (28, 29), a new episode was defined as an episode starting after 7 symptom-free

170

days from a previous episode. Each ARI episode was further categorized as either upper or lower

171

respiratory tract infections (URTI and LRTI, respectively). An URTI was defined as any or

172

combination of the following respiratory symptoms in the presence or the absence of fever: cough,

173

runny nose, nasal congestion, ear discharge, and breathing difficulty; and an LRTI was defined as

174

the presence of cough or respiratory difficulty plus any of the following: fever, fast breathing,

175

lower chest in-drawing, lung findings in auscultation (rales or rhonchi). A diarrhea episode was

176

defined according to the guidelines outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO), as the

177

passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day. A new diarrhea episode was defined when

178

a period of symptom-free of more than 48 hours was observed.

179
180

Sample collection and planned analysis

181

At enrollment, a low vaginal swab sample was collected from each mother to assess vaginal

182

microbiota composition. As well, a blood sample (5ml) was collected for routine biochemistry

183

(such as serum protein and hemoglobin levels), blood group including Rhesus factor and to enable

184

future analyses (e.g. antibody titers against specific pathogens). At delivery, a cord blood sample

185

(5 ml) was collected for future determination of the neonate nutritional status (e.g. retinol binding

186

protein and pre-albumin) and passive transfer of immunity from mother to infant (e.g. antibodies

187

to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae pathogens). Nasopharyngeal and stool samples were collected

188

from the mother and her infant at birth or within 1-2 days post-delivery, and during scheduled

189

visits. Whenever possible, a nasopharyngeal or stool sample was collected when infant

190

experienced ARI or diarrhea, respectively. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected using flocked

191

swabs for adult or pediatric swabs as per manufacturer’s instruction (Copan Diagnostics, Italy).

192

The determination of four common facultative respiratory pathogens was performed at iccdr,b by

193

bacterial culture using standard clinical diagnostics methods. The remaining part of the sample

194

was frozen and stored for future analysis of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens colonization

195

and nasopharyngeal microbiota composition. Stool were collected for future determination of

196

pathogen colonization, gut microbiota composition and metabolome, as well as analysis of

197

intestinal inflammatory biomarkers. Saliva samples were collected from both the mother and the

198

infants using Oragene DNA kits (OG-500 and OG-575, respectively) to allow for future DNA

199

extraction and determination of FUT2 and FUT3 polymorphisms. All biological samples were

200

initially stored at -20°C and subsequently transferred to -80°C for shipment on dry ice to Nestlé

201

Research where they were stored at -80°C until analysis.

202
203

Participant management

204

The enrolled mothers benefited from the antenatal medical checkups (including uro-genital health

205

assessment, blood pressure, and blood group and hemoglobin measurements), medical advice, and

206

basic medication such as iron and vitamin supplement, if required. Mothers with severe anemia

207

and negative Rh factor were referred to public hospitals, including Dhaka Medical College

208

Hospital (DMCH), Dhaka or Bangabaondhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), for

209

management and advice. Enrolled children benefited from regular follow-up of growth and

210

development, as well as prompt, free and appropriate treatment of respiratory and diarrheal

211

infections, such as antalgic, antihistamine, oral rehydration solution (ORS) with zinc, and

212

antibiotics. If necessary, referral to other hospital were made. The children were vaccinated

213

according to the UNICEF guided Expanded Program for Immunization run by the Government of

214

Bangladesh.

215
216

Statistical considerations

217

The present study is an exploratory study with a broad range of variables of interest with little or

218

no pre-existing data available at the time the study was designed to guide a priori statistical

219

analysis. Nevertheless, based on the clinical expertise in the target community and published

220

information, we have attempted sample size calculation based on the incidence of ARI in early

221

childhood and tentatively linked it to the estimates of colonization with facultative respiratory

222

pathogens. Prevalence of colonization in the population was estimated to approximately be 30%

223

and the average number of ARI episodes per infant was five (7, 30-32). No study disaggregated

224

the number of ARI episodes by colonization with respiratory pathogens, we thus assumed that

225

colonized infants suffer 25-33% more episodes than non-colonized infants. While the variation of

226

ARI incidence was unknown, we assumed it as high as 80% of the group mean. We estimated the

227

minimum sample size of each group to detect statistically significant difference in ARI episodes

228

by 30% between colonized and non-colonized groups. Assuming 5% significance level and a

229

statistical power of 90%, 225 subjects were required. With expected 10% dropout rate, 250 infants

230

had to be included, therefore 300 pregnant mothers were recruited in this study. Data analysis was

231

conducted using full analysis set (FAS) without imputation of missing data. The FAS includes

232

pairs of mother and infant who satisfied criteria of target population, i.e. mothers’ eligibility

233

criteria and infants who were born alive and have at least one post-baseline visit available. When

234

the date of completion/discontinuation was equal to the date of last visit, the subject was classified

235

as a dropout at this visit; if the date of completion/discontinuation was later than the date of last

236

visit, the subject was classified as a dropout at next visit. Weight-for-age, height-for-age and

237

weight-for-length z-scores will be calculated according to WHO child growth standards (33).

240

Discussion

241

Here we present the study protocol of a prospective, community-based, longitudinal cohort study

242

with detailed follow up of 267 infants during the first two years of life. This study was designed

243

to gather data on infant health with focus on respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, collect

244

samples from infants as well as their mothers, and assemble information about numerous potential

245

risk factors and confounders.

246
247

Study population

248

The participants of the present study inhabited peri-urban community of Nandipara. The majority

249

of the households included in the study had monthly income higher than 7000 taka, corresponding

250

to approximately 90 dollars or 390 international purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars between

251

2013 and 2016. The use of a socio-demographic questionnaire similar to the BDHS 2014 allows a

252

direct comparison of key socioeconomic, sanitation and health indicators recorded in the present

253

cohort with those reported at national level. It revealed that the population included in the present

254

cohort is similar to the third and fourth wealth quintile of Bangladeshi urban households. Housing

255

corresponds to median income families in Bangladesh, with houses built in the majority with

256

cement floor (86%) and a single room (70%). Appropriate drinking water treatment method (57%),

257

handwashing inside the household (16%), washing hands with soap after defecating (73%), before

258

eating (22%) and sharing toilet facility with other households (73%) were in line with BDHS 2014

259

findings (26). However, some of the factors considered as important risk contributors to childhood

260

infections, such as indoor pollution from cooking were less frequent in the current population. For

261

example, 95% of households used gas for cooking compared to 82% using solid fuel with 50%

262

using wood in the BDHS 2014 (26).

263

In this cohort study, 26% of the children were delivered by Caesarean section, which is very close

264

to the 23% national average, and reflecting the very rapid increase from 4% in 2004 (26).

265

According to BDHS 2014 (26), 62% of births were delivered at home, a figure similar to 55%

266

observed in the present study.

267
268

Study strengths

269

Studies of both respiratory and diarrheal infections during the first two years of life conducted in

270

community settings are rare (23), and to our knowledge our study is the first one preformed in a

271

low income country, particularly in combination with commensal microbiota determination.

272

Active surveillance of infections conducted by community-based team supervised by a physician

273

is a major strength of our study, resulting in comprehensive reporting of infections. Restricted

274

geographic area of the surveyed community facilitated communication between families and the

275

study team, and quality medical care received by the study participants provided further incentive

276

to report cases of infections. In addition, the recruitment period extending over 18 months will

277

help to disentangle the effect of the season and of infant age on the susceptibility to infections. The

278

antenatal recruitment of pregnant women and collection of antenatal samples also constitute study

279

strength, as it permits to assess pre-natal maternal factors known or hypothesized to contribute to

280

the risk of childhood infections. The drop-out rate from the study was relatively low, with 90%

281

and 82% retention at one year and two years of life, respectively. The main cause of drop-out was

282

migration out from Nandipara, and thus unlikely to introduce major bias. Another important

strength of the study is the comprehensive analysis of biological samples, including state of the art

284

molecular detection of infectious agents, covering virus and bacteria, coupled with description of

285

commensal microbiome, metabolome and gut health biomarkers.

Study limitations

288

The recruitment was limited to one site and peri-urban settings potentially limiting the conclusions

289

of our study, although it has to be noted that this feature allowed high quality of active surveillance

290

of the participants. To focus on mothers and infants who were healthy at baseline and presented

291

no specific risk factors, we excluded women younger than 18 years and with BMI below 18

292

recorded in the third trimester of pregnancy. However, this has likely led to exclusion of

293

individuals with most severe health problems. Thus, when interpreting the future findings it has to

294

be considered that the conclusions should be applied to this group and not to the general

295

population. In the absence of chest radiography to diagnose pneumonia in this study, the distinction

296

between upper and lower respiratory tract infections will be based on clinical assessment,

297

potentially leading to some misclassification. Likewise, the precision of the estimate of gestational

298

age in the present study, and resulting prematurity rate is limited. Our estimates were based on the

299

ultrasound performed in the third trimester, as the recall of Last Menstrual Period was unreliable

300

in this population according to the clinical practice. Nevertheless, the records of gestational age

301

conformed to expectations (min: 32.9 weeks, max: 44.7 weeks; average: 39.5), with the exception

302

of low prematurity rate of 8 compared to 14% WHO 2012 estimate for Bangladesh (34). However,

303

late pregnancy enrolment precluded the observation of early preterm births, and the exclusion

304

criteria eliminated some of the most risky pregnancies potentially explaining the observed lower

305

rate of prematurity. In the present study, 16 of infants were classified as low birth weight (i.e.

306

<2500 g), less than Bangladesh average of 23% reported in the National Low Birth Weight Survey

307

conducted in 2015 (35). However, we have noted that for 14% infants, the birth weight was

308

recorded as exactly 2500 g, suggesting inadvertent bias that commonly occurs in surveys,

309

especially of populations with high prevalence of low birth weight (36). Future analyses will need

310

to address this bias, as outlined by Blanc and colleagues (36).
