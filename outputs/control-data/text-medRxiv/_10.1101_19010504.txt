Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered global brain connectivity
(GBC), as assessed via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).
Previous studies found that antidepressant treatment with ketamine normalized aberrant
GBC changes in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, warranting further investigations
of GBC as a putative imaging marker. However, the results were only obtained via
global signal regression (GSR). This study is an independent replication of that analysis
using a separate dataset. GBC was analyzed in 28 individuals with MDD and 22 healthy
controls (HCs) at baseline, post-placebo, and post-ketamine. To investigate the effects
of preprocessing, three distinct pipelines were used: 1) regression of white matter
(WM)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals only (BASE); 2) WM/CSF+GSR (GSR); and 3)
WM/CSF+physiological parameter regression (PHYSIO). Compared to PHYSIO and
BASE regression, GSR reduced Fisher Z-scores (Fz-scores) in large clusters. PHYSIO
did not resemble GBC preprocessed with GSR (GBCr). Reduced GBCr was observed in
individuals with MDD at baseline in the anterior and medial cingulate cortices, as well as
in the prefrontal cortex. Significant results were only found with GSR. Ketamine had no
effect compared to baseline or placebo in either group. These results concur with
several studies that used GSR to study GBC. Altered GBCr was observed in the
cingulate and prefrontal cortices, but ketamine treatment had no effect. Further
investigations are warranted into disease-specific components of global fMRI signals
that may drive these results and of GBCr as a potential imaging marker in MDD.

Introduction
In contrast to other medical diseases, no objective biomarkers exist for major
depressive disorder (MDD). In this context, functional MRI (fMRI)—which has greatly
advanced our understanding of the aberrant neural circuits associated with MDD—may
help researchers objectively quantify psychiatric disorders [1]. In particular, resting-state
connectivity analyses that capture several minutes of brain activity at ‘rest’ are attractive
as imaging markers, given that MRI is widely available and resting state scans are
easier to record than task-based fMRI. However, resting state connectivity demands
elaborate preprocessing to eliminate spurious signals such as motion-related artifacts
and vascular or other physiological non-neuronal signals [1-3]. fMRI studies of
individuals with MDD have reported dysconnectivity in networks involved with attention,
emotion processing, salience, and goal-directed behavior [4-6]. These results overlap
with MRI findings of reduced gray matter (GM) volumes and white matter (WM)
connectivity in individuals with MDD [7-9]. While resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) connectivity
measures are thus good candidate imaging markers for MDD, essential preprocessing
and analysis procedures have nevertheless not been well established and need
validation.
Global brain connectivity (GBC), also known as functional connectivity strength,
is a correlation-based connectivity approach that has been proposed as an imaging
marker for several psychiatric disorders [10-12]. GBC yields a three-dimensional
correlation map for each fMRI scan [10]. It is calculated by correlating the time series of
every GM voxel with every other GM voxel, transforming correlations to Fisher Z-scores
(Fz-scores), and averaging these. While GBC assumes unweighted, linear correlations

and does not account for spatial autocorrelations inherent in rsfMRI data, which could
inflate Z-scores [13], correlation coefficients nevertheless yield nondirectional
information on highly connected network hubs [10,14]. In several recent studies, GBC
revealed dysconnectivity in MDD with very large effect sizes in the frontal cortex,
posterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum [11,12,15]. After treatment with the rapidacting antidepressant ketamine, aberrant connectivity returned towards values observed
in healthy participants [11,12].
Although these prior results were notable, group differences between individuals
with MDD and healthy controls (HCs) were only observed after preprocessing fMRI data
with global signal regression (GSR), as were changes following ketamine treatment
[11,12,15,16]. GSR is a somewhat controversial procedure for cleaning fMRI signals, as
it mathematically alters functional interactions by introducing negative correlations [17],
downweights voxels with large net activity [18], and could induce artificial group
differences [19,20]. However, the global signal (GS) contains spurious noise such as
residual motion artifacts and physiological signals such as vascular and respiratory
signals that are better removed [2].
To validate GBC preprocessed using GSR (GBCr) as a potential imaging marker
for MDD and antidepressant treatment, the effects of GSR as a preprocessing step in
GBC analyses should be better understood. This study sought to independently
replicate the finding of disrupted GBCr in previous studies of individuals with MDD by
recreating the preprocessing steps reported by the earlier studies [11,12]. The study
also sought to examine the specific effects of GSR on GBC by comparing three
common preprocessing strategies: 1) regression of WM/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

signals only (hereafter referred to as BASE); 2) regression of WM/CSF signals plus
regression of the total GM GS (GSR, which was used in previous studies [11,12]); and
3) WM/CSF plus physiological parameter regression (hereafter referred to as PHYSIO).
Given that the GS contains physiological components, the effects of PHYSIO regression
on GBC was hypothesized to be similar to GSR.

Materials and Methods
Participants and study design
Participants included in this study were part of a larger protocol at the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, Maryland, USA (NCT00088699, National
Institutes of Health (NIH) Protocol No. 04-M-0222). All participants provided written
informed consent after oral explanation of study procedures, which were approved by
the NIH Combined Central Nervous System Institutional Review Board. Independent
analyses and results from these studies have previously been published [6,21-24].
All included participants were between 18 and 65 years old and underwent a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with intravenous infusion of ketamine
hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or saline two weeks apart in randomized order, to minimize
potential carryover effects. Additional details, including demographic characteristics and
inclusion/exclusion criteria for each particular substudy, are available in the
Supplementary Methods. Thirty-three individuals with MDD and 25 HCs underwent MRI
scans. Of these, 30 participants with MDD and 24 HCs had complete datasets including
physiological data, and 28 MDD participants and 22 HCs were available for statistical
analysis after censoring (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). All MDD and HC

treatment-resistant, defined as having failed to respond to at least one previous
adequate antidepressant trial, assessed via the Antidepressant Treatment History Form
[25]. Severity of the current episode was measured using the Montgomery- Åsberg
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); all participants had a total score at screening and
prior to every infusion of ≥ 20. Psychometric mood assessments were conducted with
the MADRS, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale
(HAM-A) before, during, and after each infusion, as previously described [6].

Preprocessing procedures and global brain connectivity calculation
All preprocessing steps are illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1, and detailed
descriptions of rsfMRI preprocessing procedures can be found in the Supplementary
Methods.
Structural MRIs for each baseline scan were segmented into GM, WM, and CSF
with FreeSurfer version 5.3 (see Supplementary Figure S2). Preprocessing of all rsfMRI
data was conducted with AFNI version 19.0.09 [26]. To investigate the effects of
preprocessing, three distinct pipelines were used: 1) regression of WM/CSF signals only
(BASE); 2) regression of WM/CSF signals plus regression of the total GM GS (GSR);
and 3) WM/CSF plus physiological parameter regression (PHYSIO) in AFNI’s
ANATICOR [27].
As with previous studies investigating GBC in individuals with MDD [11,12], all
rsfMRI preprocessing for the three preprocessing pipelines was conducted in native
space with AFNI’s 3dTcorrMap program within each individual participant’s total GM,
including cerebellum and basal ganglia. Each participant’s GBC map was then

transformed to standardized space (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI_caez_N27)
only for second-level statistics. During normalization, GBC maps were resampled to a
final voxel size of 3.5 mm isotropic (voxel volume: 42.875 mm3). As with previous
studies of this issue [11,12], and in order to compare results, intra-prefrontal cortex
(PFC) GBC was also calculated. This was done using identical procedures for all three
of the preprocessing pipelines used for whole brain GBC analysis, but GBC calculations
were restricted to the PFC with a PFC GM-mask (see Supplementary Table S2).

Statistics
Comparing preprocessing pipelines
The variance explained (R2) by regressors in each pipeline was investigated in
order to compare their impact across groups and time points. R2 was calculated for
each regressor in total GM for each scan as well as in voxel-wise R2 maps, and
differences were compared using linear mixed models. Detailed methods describing
comparisons of the R2 for each pipeline-specific regressor can be found in the
Supplementary Methods.
Baseline GBC maps created using the three pipelines were then compared to
assess how they differed. We hypothesized that GBC maps generated with PHYSIO
regression would resemble those created using GSR. This was based on evidence
demonstrating that cardiac and respiratory response functions can be derived from the
GS [28]. For comparison, the same 22 HCs for whom GBC baseline maps were
available in all three pipelines were also included. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
post-hoc t-tests were conducted with 3dMVM, with pipeline as the factor of interest.

Results were corrected for family-wise error (FWE) at p<0.05 (two-tailed) by using the
AFNI routines 3dFWHMx and 3dClustSim with an initial threshold of p=0.001 (cluster
size>7).
The statistical methods used to analyze clinical effects can be found in the
Supplementary Methods.

Group comparisons between baseline, ketamine, and placebo scans
Differences in whole brain GBC between baseline, ketamine, and placebo scans
within and between groups (MDD and HC) were calculated independently for each
preprocessing pipeline using the AFNI routine 3dLME. Each model had main effects for
group and scan as well as their interaction as fixed effects, and participant was included
as a random effect. Post-hoc contrasts between groups (MDD vs. HC) were calculated
at each time point (baseline, ketamine, placebo), as were contrasts between each pair
of time points (ketamine-baseline, placebo-baseline, ketamine-placebo). The same
contrasts were also calculated within each group, which tested effects separately in HC
and MDD participants. To investigate the effects of age, sex, and body mass index
(BMI), the mixed model controlling for these variables was also repeated. Group GBC
maps were corrected by estimating a Gaussian-shaped autocorrelation function with
FWHMx with FWE-corrected cluster thresholds of p<0.05; these were calculated with
3dFWHMx and 3dClustSim with an initial threshold of p=0.001 (cluster size>8). To allow
our results to be compared with previous studies [11,12], an initial threshold of p<0.01
was used, which resulted in a cluster size of 23 for p<0.05, FWE-corrected. Identical
statistics were repeated with intra-PFC GBC maps.

Results
Ketamine’s clinical effects
In individuals with MDD, a significant effect of time was observed on MADRS
(F2,69=12.58, p<0.001), BDI (F2,60=6, p=0.003), and HAM-A (F2,67=7.42, p=0.001)
scores. Compared to placebo, ketamine treatment significantly reduced MADRS (t35=3.32, p=0.002), BDI (t43=-2.63, p=0.012), and HAM-A (t38=-2.4, p=0.022) scores
compared to baseline values.

Comparing GBC measures obtained with different preprocessing strategies
We compared the R2 from all three preprocessing-specific regressors: BASE,
GSR, and PHYSIO. In the baseline scans for the 22 HCs, a significant main effect of R2
was observed for every regressor (F2,426=278.6, p<0.001); BASE regression explained
significantly more variance in all GM voxels than GSR (t41589=255.8, p<0.001, false
discovery rate (FDR)-corrected) or PHYSIO regression (t41591=17.5, p<0.001, FDRcorrected, see Supplementary Figure S3C).
When R2 raw values for each regressor were compared between scans and
groups with mixed models, no significant main effect was observed for group
(Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S3). However, a significant main
effect was observed for scan (baseline, ketamine, placebo; χ2=6.21, df=2, p=0.045) for
GSR (χ2=8.09, df=2, p=0.017), and this effect was not present for PHYSIO regression
(χ2=3.58, df=2, p=0.167). Post-hoc tests found significantly lower R2 values using BASE
regression in MDD participants between both ketamine (t92=2.5, p=0.014, uncorrected)

and placebo (t95=2.58, p=0.012, uncorrected) scans compared to baseline. In
individuals with MDD, GS accounted for significantly lower R2 values between baseline
and placebo scans (t95=2.68, p=0.009, uncorrected; see Supplementary Table S4).
Analysis of spatial maps corresponding to the BASE, GSR, and PHYSIO
pipelines yielded significant effects of time point for R2 maps corresponding to BASE
regression in the right lingual cortex, right temporoparietal junction, and right inferior
temporal cortex (F-tests: 9-9.6, all p<0.05, FWE-corrected, Supplementary Figure S4).
For GSR, significant main effects were observed for group in the right lingual cortex
spreading to the cerebellum (F=15, p<0.05, FWE-corrected). Significant main effects for
scan were also noted in the left supramarginal cortex and the left precuneus (F=8.9-9.1,
p<0.05, FWE-corrected). No significant main effects or interactions were seen for group
or scan with PHYSIO regression (all p>0.05, FWE-corrected). Supplementary Figure S4
provides a spatial map of R2 values in 22 HCs indicating spatial overlap of GSR R2 with
the venous system (for additional details, see Supplementary Results, Supplementary
Figure S5, and Supplementary Table S5).

The ANOVA for the GBC of the baseline scan between all three preprocessing
pipelines in 22 HCs demonstrated a significant main effect of pipeline (p<0.05, FWEcorrected). Brain-wide reductions in Fz-scores were observed after GSR compared to
BASE regression (cluster spreading bilaterally from cerebellum to anterior with a volume
of 316,090 mm3, p<0.05, FWE-corrected, see Figure 1A-C and Supplementary Table
S3). GSR resulted in a numerically robust reduction (d=1.65) of Fz-scores and
introduced negative numbers, especially in terminal fields along the anterior-posterior
axis (Figure 1A, 1B). In contrast, no significant differences were observed between
PHYSIO and BASE regression only (all uncorrected p>0.001). A similar cluster pattern
was observed when comparing GSR with PHYSIO regression (data not shown).

Whole brain GBC results across all pipelines
Using the three common preprocessing strategies—BASE, GSR, and PHYSIO
regression—significant GBC changes were observed only after GSR, both with an initial
cluster-defining threshold of p<0.001 as well as with a more lenient p-value of p<0.01
(both corrected for FWE at p<0.05). A significant main effect was found for group across
all time points in the left cerebellar lobules VII-VIII (F=18.2, p<0.001, FWE-corrected) as
well as in the bilateral medial cingulate cortex (MCC, F=18.3, p<0.001, FWE-corrected;
see Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S6). At baseline, individuals with MDD exhibited
significantly lower GBCr compared to HCs in the bilateral MCC (Z=3.9, p<0.001, FWEcorrected, d=1.76; see Figure 2A, 2B). Controlling for age, sex, and BMI did not change

these results (see Supplementary Table S6). As in previous studies [11,12], the
p-value was lowered to <0.01; significant main effects were again observed in the
cerebellum and MCC as well as in the right middle temporal cortex. At baseline, GBCr
was significantly reduced bilaterally in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) spreading to
the superior medial frontal cortices (Z=2.9, p<0.01, FWE-corrected, Figure 2B). No
significant main effect was observed for scan (baseline, ketamine, placebo) or
interaction between group and scan (all p>0.05, FWE-corrected). In addition, reduced
baseline Fz-scores in participants with MDD in the MCC cluster were not detected with
BASE or PHYSIO regression (Figure 2C, bottom).

Intra-PFC GBC results across all pipelines
In a comparison of intra-PFC GBC results from all three preprocessing
strategies, a difference between the MDD and HC groups was observed only with GSR.
Specifically, a main effect for group with a cluster-defining uncorrected threshold of
p<0.01, FWE-corrected at p<0.05, was found in the right superior frontal cortex (F=10.4,
p<0.01, FWE-corrected, Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S7) and in the left middle
frontal cortex (F=10.5, p<0.01, FWE-corrected). Individuals with MDD had significantly
reduced intra-PFC GBCr at the baseline scan compared to HCs in the right superior
frontal cortex (Z=3.7, p<0.001, FWE-corrected, d=1.6) and in the right middle frontal
cortex (z=3.6, p<0.001, FWE-corrected, d=1.47; see Figure 3A and 3C). No significant
main effects were observed for scan or for the interaction between group and scan (all
p>0.05, FWE-corrected). As in previous studies [11,12], Fz-scores calculated with whole
brain GBCr were extracted from the PFC GM mask and the values were compared
between groups. In MDD participants, a small effect was seen for reduction in total PFC

Discussion
The principal objective of this study was to independently replicate previous
findings of altered functional connectivity in individuals with MDD by recreating the
preprocessing procedures used in previous work as rigorously as possible. In line with
earlier results, group differences in GBC were detected between individuals with MDD
and HCs only after using GSR. Contrary to our original hypothesis, PHYSIO regression
did not produce results similar to those seen using GSR.
By systematically pursuing alternative preprocessing strategies, these data
support several previous studies that used the same methodological approach [1012,15,29,30]. In particular, reduced baseline connectivity was noted in MDD participants
compared to HCs in the MCC and ACC as well as in the PFC in similar—though not
identical—clusters, consistent with prior work and analytic methods [12]. Nevertheless,
the results observed here in the MCC occurred in the opposite direction. Such
replication attempts are vital to developing rsfMRI markers for MDD. In addition, GBCr
was investigated in data drawn from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
ketamine trials. In contrast to previous studies [11,12,29] that did not use placebo
controls and obtained scans closer to the time of infusion, no treatment effects on GBCr
were observed.

Replicating GBC alterations in MDD
The goal of this study was to replicate previous findings of regionally reduced
network connectivity in individuals with MDD compared to HCs in the lateral PFC and

superior medial frontal cortex, as well as increased GBCr in the cerebellum, precuneus
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and lingual cortex [12]. However, in the present study,
effects were only found after GSR calculated within the total GM. While significantly
altered baseline GBCr was observed, our MCC cluster was located anterior to the PCC
cluster reported by Abdallah and colleagues [12], and ours exhibited hypoconnectivity
instead of hyperconnectivity. Given our rigorous statistical thresholds, the finding of PFC
hypoconnectivity was not replicated, although it should be noted that at p<0.01 we
found baseline hypoconnectivity in MDD participants to a similar spatial extent as in the
bilateral ACC and medial superior/medial frontal cortices. Lateral PFC hypoconnectivity
was not observed. In addition, the finding of reduced total PFC Fz-scores in MDD
participants at baseline was not replicated (see Figure 3B vs. Figure 3 in Abdallah and
colleagues [12]). Rather, our use of intra-PFC GBCr—which was equivalent to the
whole-brain GBCr used in earlier studies [16,29]—detected reduced baseline GBCr in
the superior and middle frontal cortex that exhibited no visual overlap with results
reported by Abdallah and colleagues [12].
It is worth noting that in the study by Abdallah and colleagues [12], frontal GBCr
Fz-scores increased significantly post-ketamine compared to baseline (lateral PFC preketamine: -0.04 vs post-ketamine: 0.39), while cerebellar Fz-scores remained
unchanged. In contrast to several previous studies [11,12,16], the present study did not
replicate any previously observed treatment effects of ketamine versus either baseline
or placebo on GBCr in either MDD participants or in HCs. This discrepancy could be
due to the longer scan interval post-ketamine (48-72 hours in the present study versus 0
or 24 hours in the study by Abdallah and colleagues [12]), but little is known about the

temporal reactivity of GBCr in pharmacological fMRI. If GBCr changes following clinical
response lasted from hours to at least three to seven days post-ketamine, such
changes in GBCr would have been detected.
Basic neuroscientific studies have consistently identified synaptic loss, reduced
dendritic complexity, and reduced neuron and glial cell density in the PFC of individuals
with MDD [31,32]. Meta-analytic structural MRI and fMRI studies have corroborated
findings of reduced volumes and dysconnectivity in the PFC of MDD participants [5,7].
In this context, it is most likely that study-related or subject-related variables could
account for the differential findings in whole brain GBCr observed here. First, a possible
explanation is that sequence parameters were different in our study compared to
previous GBC studies, which could have impaired comparability, although rsfMRI has
been demonstrated to be reliable between scanner types and coil channel numbers
[33]. Second, and in contrast to previous work [12], our participants had their eyes
closed, which significantly affects network connectivity [34]. This could explain the
divergent findings and, potentially, the opposite directionality [34]. Third, FreeSurfer was
used to segment structural MRIs, and AFNI’s afni_procy.py script was used to
preprocess rsfMRI data; in contrast, previous studies used FreeSurfer and Matlab.
Recent studies have noted considerable differences between imaging software
packages for task-based fMRI [35], and this could have impaired the comparability of
the studies. Finally, sample-related variables may have accounted for the observed
differences. While variables such as baseline MADRS score and number of previous
antidepressant trials did not differ between the present study and that of Abdallah and
colleagues [12], MDD participants in the latter study were on average 9.4 years older,

had 20% fewer females, and had been sick for six fewer years. Although controlling for
age, sex, and BMI did not substantially alter our results, the differences could
nevertheless have impaired external validity. Future studies of clinical imaging markers
should consider ways to standardize clinically relevant variables as well as sequence
differences.

Changes in GBC were found only after GSR
A novel aspect of this study was the systematic investigation of three different
preprocessing strategies. When averaged over total GM voxels, PHYSIO regression
explained less variance and was topologically dissimilar to GSR, even though cardiac
and respiratory signals share variance with the GS [36]. GBCr Fz-scores centered
around zero, resulting in GBCr maps with reduced Fz-scores, including previously
reported negative correlations [17]. Thus, GSR seemed to affect voxels in a non-linear
pattern—that is, a voxel with high Fz-scores before GSR did not necessarily exhibit high
Fz-scores after it. Consistent with previous work [37], this study demonstrated that the
R2 GS also overlapped with the venous system, a pattern not observed for either BASE
or PHYSIO regression (see Supplementary Figure S5). The GS has many non-neuronal
components, such as vascular reactivity, motion, or CO2 concentration that warrant
removal [2], but it also contains neuronal components related to slow fluctuations in
gamma-range local field potential power [38] and neuropsychological variables such as
vigilance or arousal, which would be undesirable to remove from fMRI signals [39].
Notably, topological GS alterations have been observed in individuals with
schizophrenia [40], suggesting disease-inherent components of the GS.

Correspondingly, we demonstrated regionally reduced variance in the lingual gyrus of
individuals with MDD. As regards the neurocognitive group-specific fMRI analyses,
rsfMRI data preprocessed with GSR exhibited increased R2 in neurocognitive tests [41].
Given that significant group differences in the present study were only observed after
removal of the GS, further investigations into components of the GS that characterize
individuals with MDD are necessary. Such a component could improve noise removal
procedures in future imaging marker studies.
In addition, regionally-altered differences in R2 were observed across scans, both
for the GS as well as for the BASE regression, with more absolute R2 at baseline scans.
These findings may be due to neuronal as well as non-neuronal components of the GS.
Non-neuronal noise may also account for WM/CSF, since these signals contain similar
spurious signals from vasculature, respiration, and motion- or scanner-related artifacts
[17]. Nevertheless, the significantly different R2 across scans, as observed for GS and
BASE, raises key questions regarding pharmacological connectivity in individuals with
MDD. How stable is GSR across scans in individuals with MDD? Could habituation
effects in post-treatment scans be mediated by GS components such as vigilance and
arousal?

Study strengths and limitations
The placebo control, crossover design, and inclusion of HCs are all significant
strengths of the present analysis, as is the systematic investigation of three different
preprocessing strategies.

A limiting factor associated with this study is that data were drawn from an
existing dataset. Thus, parameters such as scan interval, echo planar image (EPI)
sequence, and whether eyes were open versus closed could not be changed to exactly
match the settings of comparator studies. Furthermore, the impact of scanner,
sequence-related variables, test-retest reliability, and population-based variables on
GBCr could not be assessed. The relatively small sample size is another limitation.

Conclusions
The current study investigated the impact of preprocessing strategies on
previously published GBC results and found that they depend on the use of GSR in
preprocessing. At baseline, the present study detected altered connectivity in the
cingulate and frontal cortices of individuals with severe MDD. However, in contrast to
previous studies [11,12], hypoconnectivity instead of hyperconnectivity was observed in
the MCC and a different neuroanatomical pattern within the PFC. Furthermore,
previously observed increases in connectivity after antidepressant treatment with
ketamine were not replicated. Longer post-treatment scan interval, scanner, or subjectrelated variables may account for these discrepancies. The findings suggest that
additional studies exploring preprocessing levels are warranted before costly trials with
experimental drugs are begun. Although rsfMRI analyses such as GBCr are being
developed as candidate markers, the present study suggests that additional work is
needed before they can be used in participants with mood disorders. In addition, future
studies may wish to investigate which components of the GS may be specific to
individuals with MDD.
