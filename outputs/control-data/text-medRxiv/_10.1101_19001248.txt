ABSTRACT

46

Background: Longer-term feeding studies suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet increases energy

47

expenditure, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity. However, the validity of

48

methodology utilized in these studies, involving doubly-labeled water, has been questioned.

49

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary energy requirement for

50

weight-loss maintenance is higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet.

51

Methods: The study reports secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses from a feeding study

52

in which the primary outcome was total energy expenditure. After attaining a mean Run-in

53

weight loss of 10.5%, 164 adults with pre-weight-loss BMI of ≥25 were randomly assigned to

54

Test diets containing Low (20%), Moderate (40%) or High (60%) carbohydrate for 20 weeks.

55

Calorie content of Test diets was adjusted to maintain individual body weight within 2 kg of the

56

post-weight-loss value. In analyses by Intention-to-Treat (ITT, study completers, n=148) and Per

57

Protocol (PP, those achieving the weight-loss maintenance target, n=110), we compared

58

estimated energy requirement from 10 to 20 weeks on the Test diets using ANCOVA. Insulin

59

secretion was assessed pre-weight-loss as insulin concentration 30 minutes following 75 grams

60

oral glucose (Insulin-30).

61

Results: Estimated energy requirement was higher in the Low vs High group by models

62

involving ITT (ranging from 181 [CI 8–353] to 223 [40–406] kcal/d; P≤0.04) and PP (ranging

63

from 245 [43–446] to 295 [91–499] kcal/d; P≤0.02). This difference remained significant in

64

sensitivity analyses accounting for change in adiposity and possible non-adherence. In

65

observational analyses, pre-weight loss Insulin-30 predicted adverse change in body composition

66

following weight loss.

INTRODUCTION

76

The independent effect of dietary composition on energy expenditure remains a topic of

77

controversy. According to the carbohydrate-insulin model (CIM) of obesity, the high ratio of

78

blood insulin-to-glucagon concentration in the postprandial period with consumption of a high

79

glycemic load diet partitions metabolic fuels toward fat storage (1, 2). As a result, hunger may

80

increase and (under some conditions, such as post-weight loss) energy expenditure may decrease

81

relative to a low glycemic load diet. Because reduced energy expenditure following weight loss

82

may predispose to weight regain (3-5), research into the dietary determinants of metabolic rate

83

holds both scientific and clinical significance.

84

A recent meta-analysis reported little effect of dietary carbohydrate-to-fat ratio on energy

85

expenditure (6), but the included studies had a median duration of < 1 week. As previously

86

reviewed (2), the adaptation to a low-carbohydrate diet takes at least 2 to 3 weeks, limiting

87

inferences about chronic macronutrient effects that can be drawn from these very short trials.

88

The few prior studies of at least 2.5 weeks duration consistently showed a numerical advantage

89

favoring the low-carbohydrate diet (2), but each of these had important methodological

90

limitations, such as low statistical power, lack of randomization and physical confinement (e.g.,

91

in respiratory chambers) confounding activity-related energy expenditure.

92

In the longest feeding study addressing this question (7), we reported that total energy

93

expenditure (TEE) was about 200 to 250 kcal/d higher on a low- vs high-carbohydrate Test diet

94

throughout 20 weeks of weight-loss maintenance, as determined using doubly-labeled water

95

(DLW) methodology. However, the validity of DLW with diets varying in macronutrient

96

composition has recently been called into question (8).

97

The aim of the present study was to examine estimated energy requirement (EER) for

98

maintenance of stable weight following weight loss in our study, based on the energy provided to

99

participants in carefully controlled Test diets. If TEE increases with reduction in dietary

100

carbohydrate and DLW methodology is valid for measuring TEE when comparing different

101

macronutrient diets, we would expect to see corresponding dietary effects on EER.

METHODS

103

Overview of parent study design and original findings

104

This study presents secondary and exploratory (post hoc) analyses from a feeding trial for which

105

the methods (trial design, participants, dietary interventions, sample size, randomization),

106

participant flow, adverse events and primary outcome were previously reported (7, 9, 10).

107

Briefly, 164 participants with overweight or obesity who lost at least 10% of their body weight

108

during the Run-in phase on a hypocaloric diet were randomly assigned to low- (LOW, 20%

109

carbohydrate, 60% fat), moderate- (MOD; 40% carbohydrate, 40% fat) or high- (HIGH, 60%

110

carbohydrate, 20% fat) carbohydrate Test diets controlled for protein (20%). During the 20-week

111

Test phase, dietary energy provided to participants in prepared meals was adjusted with the aim

112

of keeping weight within 2 kg of the post-weight loss, pre-randomization baseline value. TEE

113

was measured using DLW at four time points: 1) pre-weight loss (PRE), 2) start of trial (START,

114

weeks -2 to 0, post-weight-loss), 3) midpoint of Test phase (MID, weeks 8 to 10) and 4) end of

115

Test phase (END, weeks 18 to 20). The primary finding of the trial was that TEE was

116

significantly greater on LOW vs HIGH in an Intention-to-Treat model (ITT: 209 kcal/d, n=162,

117

P=0.002 for overall group effect) and a Per Protocol model that excluded participants who did

118

not achieve weight stability at 10 or 20 weeks (PP: 278 kcal/d, n=120, overall P<0.001).

119

We previously conducted a preliminary analysis in the PP group (n=120, including 10

120

participants who achieved weight stability at MID but did not complete the trial), comparing

121

change in estimated energy intake from START to the average of MID (10 weeks) and END (20

122

weeks) using dietary data for the days when we assessed TEE (7). Change in energy intake

123

increased in a pattern consistent with the dietary effect on TEE, though without significant group

124

differences (HIGH 139, MOD 175, LOW 269 kcal/d, overall P=0.36). This pattern strengthened

125

as expected among those in the highest tertile of insulin secretion at PRE (37, -24, 340 kcal/d,

126

respectively, overall P=0.05). However, as discussed in our initial report, these preliminary

127

analyses were imprecise and inaccurate, with probable bias against those with higher energy

128

requirements, thereby limiting scientific inference.

129
130

Conceptual approach for current analyses

131

For the current study, we considered four potential reasons for imprecision and inaccuracy in the

132

initial estimates of energy requirements used to calculate energy intake: 1) excessive variability

133

in the START estimate used in models of change; 2) the limited time frame (using dietary data

134

only from the days when we assessed TEE) for evaluating energy intake during the Test phase;

135

3) unaddressed factors affecting EER, including provision of additional snacks to some

136

individuals to assist with weight-loss maintenance and 4) change in body composition affecting

137

energy balance calculations.

138

To begin our exploration of these issues, we extracted data from food production sheets

139

throughout the Test phase on daily dietary energy provided to every participant, as periodically

140

adjusted to maintain weight loss within the target range. Visual inspection revealed large changes

141

(>500 kcal/d) in dietary energy provided for many participants in all 3 diet groups from the

142

weight stabilization period at the end of the Run-in phase through the first few weeks of the Test

143

phase, demonstrating that our initial estimates of energy requirements were imprecise. By MID

144

(week 10 of the Test phase), estimates of energy requirements had stabilized, with relatively few

145

participants requiring substantial adjustments in dietary energy to maintain weight loss from that

146

point through END (week 20). This imprecision would not have biased the primary study

147

outcome involving TEE, because the initial dietary energy level for each participant was

148

established prior to randomization and there was no significant difference in body weight among

149

the diet groups during the assessment periods. However, imprecision in the START value for

150

energy intake would erode power for the change models originally reported (11, 12).

151

As an alternative approach to the inherent limitations of an imprecise baseline (START

152

value) in measurement of a change variable, we examined EER with general linear models

153

(ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline covariates that would plausibly influence energy requirements

154

(such as age, sex and weight). We focused on the daily average energy provided from 10 to 20

155

weeks as our most accurate measure of EER, with primary interest in the HIGH vs LOW diet

156

comparison in the PP analysis to maximize power. Consistent with the approach used with our

157

original TEE outcome, we calculated EER per kg and normalized the results as kcal/d using the

158

average START weight of our participants (82 kg). We examined diet group differences in EER

159

at START and during weeks 10 through 20 of the Test phase, with and without adjustment for

160

the START value. In sensitivity analyses, we explored how changes in body fat mass might

161

influence EER and how possible non-adherence to energy prescription might influence EER.

162
163

Assessment of Test diet energy

164

Details regarding the dietary interventions were published previously (9, 10). In brief, the

165

hypocaloric Run-in diet comprised 45% of energy from carbohydrate, 35% from fat, and 25%

166

from protein. Eucaloric Test diets were controlled for protein and varied in carbohydrate-to-fat

167

ratio as indicated above. Standardized menus were calculated for 2000-kcal Run-in and Test

168

diets using Food Processor Nutrition Analysis Software (ESHA Research Inc., Salem, OR) with

169

energy distributed across breakfast (450 kcal), lunch (650 kcal), dinner (650 kcal), and an

170

evening snack (250 kcal). Data for each menu item were exported from the ESHA Food

10
171

Processor to Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA), and gram weights were imported from Excel

172

into SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). In SAS, 2000-kcal menus were scaled to coincide with

173

individualized energy levels, and food production sheets (1 sheet per participant per meal or

174

snack) were generated to specify gram portions of each menu item.

175

Estimating and adjusting Run-in and Test diet energy levels. Individualized energy levels

176

were estimated and then adjusted when necessary, but not more frequently than every two weeks.

177

To inform adjustments, body weight was measured daily using Wi-Fi scales (Withings Inc.,

178

Cambridge, MA) synced with a study-specific online portal (SetPoint Health, Needham, MA). At

179

the beginning of the Run-in phase (PRE), energy levels were set at 60% of estimated needs (13),

180

and then adjusted to achieve targeted weight loss. Energy levels for weight stabilization at the

181

end of the Run-in phase were estimated based on rate of weight loss over 20 days: energy intake

182

during weight loss (kcal/day) + rate of weight loss (kg/day × 7700 kcal/kg). During the Test

183

phase, energy levels were adjusted when deviation from the START anchor weight exceeded ±2

184

kg and/or the slope of weight regressed on time was ≥15 g per day over 14 days.

185

Some participants received unit bars (100 kcal per bar with diet-specific carbohydrate-to-

186

fat ratio) and/or ad libitum snacks, in addition to the meals and snacks listed on food production

187

sheets. The purpose of providing unit bars was to: 1) replace some of the meal calories, when

188

large portions were a barrier to consuming all provided food and 2) immediately adjust energy

189

levels, before meal adjustments could be implemented according to established production

190

cycles, to achieve weight-loss maintenance (±2 kg of START anchor weight). The purpose of

191

providing foods for ad libitum snacks (n=11) was to halt continued weight loss in participants

192

who were already consuming large meals. Examples of snack foods (for each diet) included:

193

banana, skim milk (HIGH); bagel chips, chocolate chips, apple, banana, nut butters (MOD); nuts,

11
194

nut butters, dark chocolate, whole milk (LOW). We conservatively estimated energy content of

195

ad libitum snacks at 200 kcal per day, for the days when participants (n=11) received snacks. In

196

preliminary analyses, we noted similar study outcomes with energy content estimated at 500 kcal

197

per day (data not presented).

198

Quantifying unconsumed energy. Data on food consumption recorded in the online portal

199

were used to calculate daily unconsumed energy, which totaled < 5% throughout the study. For

200

supervised meals, unconsumed menu items were weighed, and gram amounts were entered into

201

the portal by food service staff. Menu data exported from the ESHA Food Processor to Excel

202

were used to create a “food library,” interfaced with the portal, for converting gram amounts to

203

kcal. For unsupervised take-out meals, percentages of menu items consumed were recorded by

204

participants, using a form in the online portal that was prepopulated with daily menus from food

205

production sheets, so that unconsumed energy could be calculated as follows: energy provided –

206

(energy provided × percentage consumed). Unconsumed energy during supervised and

207

unsupervised meals was summed to obtain a total for each day. Food consumption data for

208

calculating unconsumed energy were not available electronically for cohort 1 (n=25 in ITT, n=18

209

in PP), prior to developing the online portal, and assumed to be 0 (this methodological limitation

210

is addressed in a sensitivity analysis).

211

Calculating EER. An EER for each participant was calculated as the average daily energy

212

level during weeks 10 through 20 of the Test phase. The calculation included energy in weighed

213

meals and snacks (as specified on food production sheets), ad libitum snacks (200 kcal/d), and

214

unit bars (based on the number provided), with correction for unconsumed energy in weighed

215

meals and snacks. The first 10 weeks of the Test phase was considered adequate time for

216

physiological adaptations to the Test diets, that could affect energy metabolism and fluctuations

217

in body weight (2), and fine-tuning initially imprecise estimates of energy levels for weight-loss

218

maintenance. We also calculated EER for the first day of the Test phase (EER at START), to

219

obtain insight regarding the level of imprecision and inaccuracy in the initial estimates of energy

220

requirements, and for use as a baseline covariate in a statistical model.

221
222

Assessment of body composition

223

We assessed body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Discovery A,

224

Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) and isotope dilution. Data from DXA, the more precise

225

method, were available for PRE, START and END. Data from isotope dilution were available

226

for the same time points and also MID, allowing assessment of adiposity from weeks 10 through

227

20 of the Test phase which was the exact timeframe of interest for determining EER (after the

228

initial 10-week period of physiological adaptation). Total body water was estimated using the

229

isotope dilution space for 18O (calculated as previously described) (9), divided by 1.01 (to correct

230

for binding to non-exchangeable sites) (14). Total body water was divided by 0.73 to estimate

231

fat-free mass (FFM). Fat mass (FM) was calculated by subtracting FFM from total body weight.

232

Percent body fat was calculated as: FM / body weight × 100%.

233
234

Statistical analyses

235

For all summary and inferential computations, we used SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

236

Descriptive data. We inspected raw distributions of EER during the Test phase for the

237

ITT and PP groups and compared raw distributions and descriptive data (mean and median) with

238

those of TEE.

13
239

Variability in Estimated Energy Requirement at START. We used partial correlation

240

analysis to determine whether excessive variability in EER might have obscured the effect of diet

241

on change in EER in our preliminary analyses (7) . Controlling for diet group, we evaluated

242

partial correlation of the residuals from models comparing EER at START with EER during the

243

Test phase (MID through END), and TEE at START with TEE during the Test Phase (average of

244

MID and END).

245

Diet effect on Estimated Energy Requirement. The analytic framework for statistical

246

inference on EER and other outcomes was the general linear model (GLM) including ANCOVA.

247

We evaluated EER at START (with body weight at START included as a covariate) and EER

248

during the Test phase (with and without EER at START as a covariate). To be consistent with the

249

approach in our prior study (7), the reported models include diet group assignment and a design

250

variable (a polytomous covariate labeled cohort, which captured all combinations of study site,

251

cohort, and enrollment wave, including 11 categories). Because inclusion of this variable utilizes

252

10 degrees of freedom, and we have no reason to hypothesize confounding by cohort, a model

253

without this adjustment was evaluated. Other variables in the primary model included sex, age at

254

randomization, weight loss during the Run-in phase (expressed as a percentage of PRE body

255

weight), START weight, and START TEE. One participant who developed a medical condition

256

(hypothyroidism) that affects energy expenditure was excluded in the final analysis plan on an a

257

priori basis from the primary outcome in our prior study (7, 9). We present models with and

258

without exclusion of this individual. The outcome was the Test phase average of EER from

259

weeks 10-20, modified from our original change (pre-to-post) analyses, in consideration of the

260

rationale above, and as further addressed in Figure 1.

261

From parameters of the fitted models, taking account of all data, we tested two

262

hypotheses. First, that the outcome was uniform across all diet groups, using an F test with two

263

degrees of freedom and a P ≤ 0.05 as a threshold for significance. The HIGH – LOW

264

comparison was equivalent to a test for linear trend by carbohydrate proportion, given the equal

265

increments of carbohydrate content (60%, 40%, 20%) across Test diets. In this second test, the

266

null hypothesis was zero difference between HIGH and LOW in a two-sided Student’s t test.

267

We conducted four sensitivity analyses using GLM (ANCOVA) to explore the potential

268

effects of changes in body composition and non-adherence on EER during weight-loss

269

maintenance. These analyses were based on our most conservative estimate of EER in the weight

270

stable PP group (Table 2, model 2). For every kilogram increase or decrease in FM from START

271

to END, assessed by DXA, we subtracted or added 55 kcal/d (7700 kcal/kg ÷ 140 days, the

272

relevant time period). Similarly, for change in FM from MID to END, assessed by isotope

273

dilution, we subtracted or added 110 kcal/d (7700 kcal/kg ÷ 70 days, the relevant time period).

274

As a proxy measure of non-adherence, we defined energy discrepancy as the ratio of EER-to-

275

TEE and excluded participants with energy discrepancy in the top quintile (those most likely to

276

have under-consumed provided foods) and bottom quintile (those most likely to have consumed

277

foods off protocol). In a final model, we excluded individuals in cohort 1, for whom we had no

278

food consumption data in the online portal to calculate unconsumed energy as a measure of non-

279

adherence.

280

Changes in body composition. We analyzed change in percent body fat from START to

281

END with DXA, and also from MID to END with isotope dilution. These models included only

282

design variables (diet group, cohort). In cross-sectional and prospective observational analyses

283

involving the Run-in phase, we evaluated the associations of Insulin-30 (measured at PRE) with

RESULTS

291

Descriptive data

292

We randomly assigned 164 participants to a diet group for the Test phase. Of these, 148

293

completed the trial and were included in the ITT analyses. Among the completers, 110 achieved

294

weight-loss maintenance and were included in PP analyses. Table 1 summarizes baseline data

295

describing the cohort, including those who completed the weight loss Run-in phase (for analysis

296

of Insulin-30 and body composition) and those in the ITT and PP groups (for the trial outcomes).

297

About two-thirds of the cohort were women, mean age was ~30 years, and mean BMI at PRE

298

was ~32 kg/m2. Supplemental Figure 1 illustrates raw distributions of EER for the ITT and PP

299

groups. Overall, the median and mean values of EER were 89.2% and 87.7% of TEE,

300

respectively.

301
302

Variability in Estimated Energy Requirement at START

303

To determine whether excessive variability might have obscured the effect of diet on energy

304

requirements in our preliminary analyses of change (7), we compared EER at START with EER

305

measured from weeks 10 through 20 of the Test phase. As shown in Figure 1, the partial R2 after

306

adjusting for diet group (0.54) was much weaker than the partial R2 involving TEE (0.85). These

307

findings suggest that analytic models of change have adequate power for evaluating TEE but not

308

EER (11, 12), providing rationale for using an alternative approach (ANCOVA).

313

HIGH, ranging from a mean of 181 to 323 kcal/d in models with varying covariate structure. In

314

sensitivity analyses (Table 3), this diet effect remained robust after accounting for concurrent

315

change in body composition, excluding individuals for whom the EER-to-TEE ratio raised the

316

possibility of non-adherence, and additional exclusion of individuals in cohort 1 lacking non-

317

adherence data from the online portal. The nominal order of effect by group, with MOD

318

intermediate between LOW and HIGH, showed a pattern similar to that of TEE. The ratio of

319

EER-to-TEE did not differ by diet group (Supplemental Figure 2), indicating no selective non-

320

adherence or bias in group comparisons.

321
322

Changes in body composition

323

As shown in Supplemental Table 1, there were no significant diet group differences in adiposity

324

by DXA or isotope dilution throughout the study.

325

In cross-sectional analyses, Insulin-30 was strongly associated with PRE body weight

326

(4.4 kg per 100 µU/mL increase in Insulin-30, P for linear trend = 0.0005; Figure 2A) and

327

adiposity (1.2% body fat per 100 µU/mL increase in Insulin-30, P for linear trend = 0.005; data

328

not depicted). Insulin-30 also predicted change in adiposity during weight loss, with percent

329

body fat decreasing less from PRE to START among individuals in the top versus bottom

330

quintiles of Insulin-30 (-3.1% vs -3.8%, P=0.0085; P for linear trend = 0.002; Figure 2B). This

331

prospective association was moderately attenuated, but remained statistically significant, with

332

further adjustment for PRE body weight, BMI or adiposity. (However, inclusion of these

333

adiposity measures may over-correct the models, due to potential collinearity with Insulin-30.)

DISCUSSION

336

In this analysis of a large feeding study, we observed higher estimated energy requirement on a

337

low- vs high- carbohydrate diet during weight-loss maintenance. The magnitude of this effect

338

(about 200 to 300 kcal/d, or ≥ 50 kcal/d for every 10% decrease in carbohydrate as a proportion

339

of total energy) and the numerical order across groups (LOW > MOD > HIGH) are

340

commensurate with previously reported changes in TEE (7), supporting the CIM. If reproducible

341

and generalizable, this finding may inform the scientific understanding of how dietary

342

composition affects metabolism and the design of more efficacious long-term obesity treatment.

343

These results also have relevance to outpatient metabolic study methods. In a recent

344

analysis of an observational pilot study, Hall et al. (8) questioned the validity of DLW

345

methodology to compare diets differing in carbohydrate-to-fat ratio, in part due to the

346

“theoretical possibility that … [differential] fluxes through biosynthetic pathways” could inflate

347

measured energy expenditure on diets with lower carbohydrate content. However, their estimates

348

of isotopic trapping through de novo lipogenesis, the pathway of greatest potential concern,

349

appear overstated, and DLW has worked well in animals with diets varying widely in

350

macronutrient ratio, including obligate carnivores (7, 15). The congruence in dietary effect on

351

energy intake and expenditure from our trial provide qualified validation for the use of DLW in

352

human diet studies, though the possibility of other, unrecognized biases cannot be excluded. In

353

contrast to the theoretical concerns involving DLW, whole room calorimetry – the other gold

354

standard method – has been shown to underestimate adaptive thermogenesis (16) because of

355

inherent constraints on physical activity energy expenditure (a confounding issue in the analyses

356

of Hall et al. (8)). Recognizing that reduction in dietary carbohydrate has been hypothesized to

357

attenuate adaptive thermogenesis with weight loss (2, 7), macronutrient studies utilizing whole

19
358

room calorimetry may yield results biased against low-carbohydrate diets. Indeed, the prior

359

validation study (16) found a better correspondence between dietary calorie titration and TEE –

360

the approach we used here – for DLW vs whole room calorimetry under several physiological

361

conditions.

362

In observational analyses, pre-weight loss insulin secretion was strongly associated with

363

greater body weight and adiposity before weight loss, and prospectively with an adverse change

364

in body composition (a lesser decrease in adiposity) following weight loss, potentially

365

predisposing to weight regain. Although we cannot rule out reverse causation and confounding,

366

the findings are consistent with other lines of investigation free from such limitations. According

367

to the CIM, increased primary insulin secretion (versus secondary hyperinsulinemia in

368

compensation for insulin resistance) partitions metabolic fuels away from oxidation and instead

369

into storage, lowering energy expenditure and promoting adiposity. Indeed, individual

370

predisposition to high insulin secretion has been linked to weight gain in translational research

371

(17), a cohort study (18), a Mendelian randomization study (19) and several clinical trials (20,

372

21). These relationships appear to be strongly attenuated on a low-glycemic load diet, as was

373

also reported for TEE among individuals with high insulin secretion in our recent trial (7). In

374

contrast, DIETFITS found no effect modification involving insulin secretion for weight loss on

375

lower-fat vs lower-carbohydrate diets, but that null finding might relate to the focus on reducing

376

sugar and other processed carbohydrates throughout the trial, resulting in a low glycemic load in

377

both diet groups (22). Thus, our current study provides additional data on a novel diet-phenotype

378

interaction and highlights a high-risk subgroup that may do especially well with dietary

379

carbohydrate restriction, similar to findings from DiOGenes and other trials involving fasting

380

glucose or insulin resistance (23).

381

Strengths of this study include relatively large size and long duration for a feeding trial,

382

demonstration of weight stability during the Test phase, state-of-the-art methods to produce

383

nutrient-controlled diets and monitor quality control, concurrent measurement of body

384

composition, and sufficient power to conduct informative sensitivity analyses. The main

385

limitation is non-adherence to the Test diets. This methodological issue, common to all long-

386

term outpatient feeding studies, could lead to an overestimation of the diet effect on energy

387

requirement under two conditions: if individuals on the low- versus high-carbohydrate diet

388

consumed less of the provided food than reported when not under direct observation; or if those

389

on the high- versus low-carbohydrate diet consumed more food off protocol. Either of these

390

scenarios might arise if the low-carbohydrate diet were less palatable or more satiating.

391

Conversely, the high-carbohydrate diet was substantially lower in energy density; the diet effect

392

could be underestimated if participants in that group had difficulty consuming the larger volume

393

of food. However, we designed the diets to be as similar as possible in types of foods included,

394

cooking methods and palatability (10). Moreover, we saw no discrepancy in the ratio of EER-to-

395

TEE across diet groups, nor evidence of overall bias in a sensitivity analyses excluding

396

individuals with EER-to-TEE ratio in the highest quintile (for whom energy intake might have

397

been overestimated) and in the lowest quintile (for whom energy intake might have been

398

underestimated). Moreover, the findings strengthened in the PP analyses, involving participants

399

who demonstrated successful weight-loss maintenance as an objective measure of compliance

400

(the opposite would be expected if non-adherence contributed importantly to the observed

401

effect).

402
403

Other study limitations include the inherent imprecision of methods for measuring small
changes in body composition during weight-loss maintenance, and possible inaccuracy arising

404

from changes in body water on diets differing in macronutrient content. However, on the latter

405

issue, any changes in body water resulting from reduction in dietary carbohydrate would stabilize

406

after a few weeks, allowing for an unconfounded measurement of body composition between 10

407

and 20 weeks of the Test phase, the relevant period for our calculations of energy requirements.

408

Furthermore, our estimates of energy requirements vary based on covariate structure of the

409

analytic models and other assumptions, and the 3-way diet comparison is not significant in some

410

models. However, the comparison between the low- and high-carbohydrate diet was consistently

411

significant as hypothesized in multiple models and sensitivity analyses. In light of the foregoing,

412

our estimates of the magnitude of the diet effect on energy requirements should be interpreted

413

cautiously.

414

Because of the inherent limitations of outpatient feeding studies discussed here, some

415

suggest that the only informative diet studies are those conducted on metabolic wards (24), but

416

these too have major limitations. For logistical and financial reasons, ward studies rarely exceed

417

a few weeks in duration – too short to distinguish transient adaptive processes from the chronic

418

metabolic effects of macronutrients (2, 25). Ward studies also entail an artificial environment,

419

constraint on spontaneous physical activities, and the psychobiological effects of social isolation

420

and other stresses. Moreover, even with presumably maximum control, substantial “unaccounted

421

energy” – the basis of criticisms of our trial by Hall et al. (26) – may occur, as was seen in the

422

control diet arm of a recent trial by Hall et al. (27). Discrepancies in energy balance are

423

unsurprising, considering the cumulative error that would arise in comparisons encompassing

424

three imprecise measures (energy intake, energy expenditure, and body energy stores), even with

425

optimal conditions.

22
426

To elucidate underlying mechanisms involving diet and chronic disease, we will need a

427

variety of complementary study designs, novel methods for ensuring high levels of dietary

428

control for longer periods, multiple methods for measuring energy expenditure and substrate

429

metabolism, and attention to effect modification by biological predisposition (2, 23, 28).

430

Although research into more powerful behavioral and environmental interventions is also

431

warranted, these approaches will be most effective when informed by accurate knowledge of the

432

metabolic effects of dietary composition.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. Variability in estimated energy requirement (EER) and total energy expenditure
(TEE). The correlation between the baseline (START) and outcome measurements adjusted for
diet was substantially lower for EER (Panel A) compared to TEE (Panel B), providing rationale
for using ANCOVA rather change models for EER.

Figure 2. Associations of Insulin-30 with body weight and change in change in body fatness.
Individuals with high Insulin-30 prior to weight loss have higher body weight in a cross-sectional
analysis (Panel A) and a more adverse response to weight loss (proportionately less fat loss) in a
prospective analysis (Panel B).

Supplemental Table 1. Changes in body composition by DXA and isotope dilution throughout the study.
No significant diet effects were observed during the Test phase. Change in percentage fat by DXA was assessed
as a difference, END – START. Change in percentage body fat by isotope dilution was assessed as a difference,
average (MID, END) – START. Statistical models were minimally adjusted for cohort; adjustment for other
baseline covariates did not materially affect the results.
