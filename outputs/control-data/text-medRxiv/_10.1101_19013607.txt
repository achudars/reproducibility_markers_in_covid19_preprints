Alien limb and apraxia 2
1

ABSTRACT

2

Alien limb refers to movements that seem purposeful but are independent of patients’ reported intentions. Alien

3

limb often co-occurs with apraxia in the corticobasal syndrome, and anatomical and phenomenological

4

comparisons have led to the suggestion that alien limb and apraxia may be causally related as failures of goal-

5

directed movements. Here, we characterised the nature of alien limb symptoms in patients with the corticobasal

6

syndrome (n=30) and their relationship to limb apraxia. Twenty-five patients with progressive supranuclear

7

palsy Richardson syndrome served as a disease-control group. Structured examinations of praxis, motor

8

function, cognition and alien limb were undertaken in patients attending a regional specialist clinic. Twenty-

9

eight patients with corticobasal syndrome (93%) demonstrated significant apraxia and this was often

10

asymmetrical, with the left hand preferentially affected in 77% of patients. Moreover, 83% reported one or more

11

symptoms consistent with alien limb. The range of these phenomena was broad, including changes in the sense

12

of ownership and control as well as unwanted movements. Regression analyses showed no significant

13

association between the severity of limb apraxia and both the occurrence of an alien limb and the number of

14

alien limb phenomena reported. Bayesian estimation showed a low probability for a positive association

15

between alien limb and apraxia, suggesting that alien limb phenomena are not likely to be related to severe

16

apraxia. Our results shed light on the phenomenology of these disabling and as yet untreatable clinical features,

17

with relevance to theoretical models of voluntary action.

Alien limb and apraxia 3
1

INTRODUCTION

2

Alien limb phenomena are a heterogeneous group of behaviours in which one or more of a patient’s limbs,

3

usually an arm, behaves in a manner that appears purposeful or semi-purposeful but is independent of the

4

patient’s reported intentions [1–5]. Patients’ reactions to the unwanted motor behaviours are variable, including

5

lack of awareness, surprise, frustration or denial of ownership of the limb itself [6]. Alien limb motor

6

phenomena have been divided into two main groups [3]. The first group includes complex, unwilled motor acts,

7

including intermanual conflict, mirror movements, interference, and the pushing aside of the directed limb by

8

the autonomous limb. These movements have been described as often bimanual, and liable to occur within two

9

scenarios: (a) the offending hand is involuntarily recruited to tasks which the patient intends to perform

10

unimanually with the other hand and (b) the offending limb undertakes the incorrect act when desired to act in

11

concert with the other hand. The second group of phenomena include simple, unwilled, quasi-reflex actions.

12

These include autonomous reaching, grasping and utilisation behaviour, automatic limb withdrawal or

13

levitation.

14
15

Despite ample clinical and basic research, the aetiology of alien limb remains poorly understood [5]. Case

16

studies of patients with focal brain lesions have implicated frontal brain regions [7]. An anatomically derived

17

classification of alien limb phenomena identified two separate syndromes [8]. One syndrome associated with

18

frontal callosal damage, with or without bilateral frontal involvement, typically presents with intermanual

19

conflict (in which involuntary non-dominant hand activity is precipitated by the internally-evoked actions of the

20

dominant hand). The other is a syndrome seen following damage to the left frontomedial and callosal regions in

21

which the patient’s dominant hand exhibits unintentional reaching and grasping evoked by external stimuli [8].

22

Within these frontal regions, damage to the pre-supplementary motor area may play a central role in the

23

development of alien limb [9, 10].

24
25

Alien limb is a common clinical feature of the corticobasal syndrome. Corticobasal syndrome classically arises

26

from the specific pathology termed ‘corticobasal degeneration’ [11], which is associated with aggregation of

27

hyperphosphorylated 4-repeat tau protein [12]. Corticobasal syndrome can also arise from other

28

neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer type pathology [13–15], Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [14] or the cumulative

29

effects of cerebrovascular disease [16]. The corticobasal syndrome can present with subcortical motor features

30

(including akinetic-rigidity, dystonia and myoclonus) or cortical features (including visuospatial and deficits,

non-fluency and cortical sensory loss) [17, 18]. The current international consensus clinical diagnostic criteria

2

for corticobasal syndrome include alien limb [19], as have earlier diagnostic criteria [20, 21].

3
4

Another disorder of the sensorimotor system that is included in the diagnostic criteria of, and common in the

5

corticobasal syndrome is called ‘apraxia’ [7, 9, 10, 22]. Apraxia may be defined as a disorder of “the execution

6

of learned movement which cannot be accounted for either by weakness, incoordination or sensory loss, or by

7

incomprehension of or inattention to commands” [23]. It is assessed through the pantomiming of actions

8

(performing an action on request without example) and imitation of gestures [18]. It can result from focal

9

lesions, classically in the corpus callosum and dominant hemisphere [23, 24], as well as neurodegenerative

10

disorders such as corticobasal syndrome [18, 19]. Limb apraxia is usually considered in three forms, often called

11

‘ideational’, ‘ideomotor’, and ‘limb-kinetic apraxia’ [18, 25]. Ideational apraxia results from a conceptual deficit

12

of the desired action. Ideomotor apraxia is a failure to convert the concept of the action into a motor programme

13

to execute the necessary movements; it usually manifests itself through spatiotemporal errors. Limb-kinetic

14

apraxia describes reduced dexterity predominantly affecting fine movements through incoordination of the

15

fingers, beyond that attributable to elementary motor disorders such as pyramidal dysfunction, rigidity, ataxia,

16

tremor or dystonia [26]. Ideomotor and limb-kinetic apraxias appear to be the most common and may co-exist in

17

the corticobasal syndrome [26], although isolated examination of apraxia in patients with co-existent rigidity,

18

dystonia or tremor is often difficult [18, 19].

19
20

In addition to their co-occurrence in the corticobasal syndrome, limb apraxia and alien limb syndrome are both

21

disorders of complex sensorimotor function with some similarities. First, shared anatomic substrates have been

22

implicated through association with lesions either directly affecting the supplementary motor, pre-frontal and

23

parietal cortices or causing their disconnection [7, 9, 10, 27, 28]. Second, classical alien behaviours were

24

phenomenologically described as ‘diagonistic dyspraxia’ [27] and ‘magnetic apraxia’ [29]. Third, in patients

25

with corticobasal syndrome, both apraxia severity and alien limb symptoms have been associated with an

26

implicit measure of the sense of agency [10]. However, there are clear differences between these clinical

27

entities. Apraxia describes aberrant voluntary movement whereas the anarchic action of an alien limb is

28

experienced by the patient as involuntary. An alien limb is associated with a sense of foreignness and loss of

29

agency, which is not characteristic of apraxia.

Alien limb and apraxia 5
1

Here, we investigated the phenomenological nature of alien limb symptoms in the corticobasal syndrome and

2

their possible link with apraxia. We performed structured examinations of praxis, motor function, cognition and

3

alien limb in patients with corticobasal syndrome. We summarised the rate of different alien limb symptoms.

4

We then used Bayesian analyses to compare two alternate hypotheses: (i) that alien limb phenomena and apraxia

5

are related to each other versus (ii) that alien limb phenomena are not related, in that there is no association

6

between alien limb phenomena and the severity of apraxia. This evidence-based null result would suggest

7

differences in terms of their functional anatomy and physiology despite co-occurrence in the corticobasal

8

syndrome.

METHODS

11

Participants were recruited from a specialist regional neurology clinic for cognitive and movement disorders

12

during a 40-month period, serving a population of approximately one and a half million. Patients met the

13

diagnosis of probable corticobasal syndrome by clinical criteria confirmed at the time of assessment rather than

14

first presentation [17], and were later re-diagnosed under the revised consensus criteria [19], as probable

15

corticobasal syndrome with either probable or definite corticobasal degeneration. Magnetic resonance imaging

16

in each case had not indicated alternative diagnoses. The age, sex and premorbid handedness of participants are

17

summarised in Table 1. Twenty-five patients with possible or probable Progressive Supranuclear Palsy

18

Richardson’s syndrome (PSP-RS) were recruited as a disease control group under the former MINDS-SPSP

19

criteria for PSP [30]. Unlike the current MDS criteria for PSP [31], the former criteria excluded overlap

20

syndromes such as PSP-corticobasal syndrome. The research was carried out in accordance with guidelines and

21

regulations approved by the Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee (now ‘East of England – Cambridge

22

Central’), who approved the experimental protocols. All participants gave full, informed, written consent before

23

the experiment.

24
25

The cognitive assessment included neuropsychological evaluation with the Revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive

26

Examination [32, 33], the Mini Mental State Examination [34], and the Frontal Assessment Battery [35]. Motor

27

function was evaluated using part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [36] and recording of

28

myoclonus, mirror movements, dystonias and dyskinesias. On our assessment of apraxia, we focused on a

29

tailored examination scored according to the broad definition of apraxia without attempting to separate subtypes

30

because of the inherent difficulties of clinical differentiation in a complex movement disorder. Praxis was

31

assessed using a structured bilateral 5-part examination. This included the miming of 3 transitive and 3

intransitive unilateral representational actions, testing each in both the left and right hands separately (6 left, 6

2

right, instructed verbally), and the imitation of 3 unilateral non-representational hand configurations (3 left, 3

3

right, gestures demonstrated by the examiner) and the imitation of 2 bimanual hand configurations. Orofacial

4

mime (to mime a kiss and yawn, instructed verbally) was also assessed. Each of the 20 actions was scored 1 in

5

the absence of apraxic error and 0 if apraxic errors were observed. For the association with alien limb (below),

6

we focused on limb praxis score (range: 1-18).

7
8

We assessed the presence of alien limb phenomena using a screening questionnaire to guide a structured history

9

from both the patient and an accompanying relative or carer who could corroborate and prompt recall of specific

10

events. This approach was chosen, as alien limb events are intermittent and hard to provoke (unlike apraxia),

11

making it necessary to rely on recalled events. All of our corticobasal syndrome patients had the mental capacity

12

to report their symptoms, and we sought to focus on the patient’s own experience of agency which is crucial for

13

characterising and diagnosing alien limb [2]. The questionnaire included a set of 13 possible experiences

14

occurring within the past six months. The questions addressed different forms of alien limb phenomena:

15

autonomous and disobedient limb movement, the interference of tasks, the sense of control and ownership and

16

other sensations relating to the limb. The questions were: 1) Does your hand copy the other hand on its own?* 2)

17

Does your hand ever float up in the air on its own?* 3) Do you prefer to hold your hand with the other hand? 4)

18

Does your hand feel fidgety or restless to you? (emphasis on the feel) 5) Does your hand sometimes reach or

19

touch things without you intending it to?* 6) Does your hand touch your face? 7) Do you prefer to keep your

20

hand in your pocket? 8) Does your hand ever try to stop the 'good' hand doing what you want it to do?* 9) Does

21

your hand ever reach or touch things even when you want it not to?* 10) Do you ever wish your hand would go

22

away? 11) Does your hand sometimes feel that does not belong to you?* 12) Does your hand feel like it belongs

23

to somebody else? 13) Does it feel as though someone else is controlling your hand? The six questions marked

24

with an asterisk refer to phenomena which we considered most specific to alien limb, including anarchic hand

25

phenomena, intermanual conflict and loss of the sense of ownership. We also completed the structured praxis

26

examination and alien limb questionnaire with the PSP-RS cohort for validation.

27
28

Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to test for an association between limb apraxia severity

29

(measured through the structured praxis examination) and alien limb. Our main analyses focused on the specific

30

alien limb symptoms reported by patients. Age and ACE-R scores were included as covariates of no interest. All

31

variables were z-score scaled before entered to the regression analyses. Statistical analyses were performed in R

‘brms’ package, with priors set to default weakly informative priors [38]. All plots were generated with ggplot2

RESULTS

6

Patient demographics and clinical information are summarised in Table 1. Limb praxis scores were incomplete

7

for one patient with corticobasal syndrome and another with PSP-RS. All patients completed the alien limb

8

questionnaire.

9
10

Praxis Scores

11

Apraxia was very common in our corticobasal syndrome cohort, with only 1/30 patients demonstrating normal

12

praxis. In corticobasal syndrome, praxis scores ranged between 0/20 (inability to perform any of the required

13

movements) and 20/20 (no deficit) (Fig. 1A). As shown in Table 1, patients with corticobasal syndrome were

14

significantly apraxic in all limb movements tested, resulting in mean total limb praxis score of 9.3/20 (SD 5.2).

15

Of the 29 patients with apraxia, the left hand was preferentially affected in 23 patients; the right hand in four and

16

symmetrical in two patients. The only left-handed corticobasal syndrome patient exhibited predominantly left-

17

sided apraxia. By contrast, most patients with PSP-RS did not have apraxia. Seventeen of twenty-four patients

18

with PSP-RS scored 20/20 (no deficit) and three more scored 19/20.

19
20

Alien limb phenomena

21

Alien limb phenomena were reported in the majority of corticobasal syndrome patients (Fig. 1B) but only one

22

person with PSP-RS (who reported only the non-specific symptom that he had a fidgety hand that he tended to

23

hold). Further analyses are restricted to the corticobasal syndrome group.

24
25

Overall, 83% of the patients with corticobasal syndrome reported at least one symptom of alien limb, and 72%

26

reported at least one of the more specific symptoms. These specific symptoms included motor phenomena and

27

whether the patient feels that their limb belongs to them (see Methods). Each individual item received

28

affirmative responses from some patients and their frequency is summarised in Figure 2. Common responses

29

were of the tendency to hold the offending hand with the better hand (53%), for unwilled arm levitation (50%),

30

and the sensation that the limb was not theirs (50%). Patients rarely reported preferring to keep their bad hand

31

restricted in a pocket (20%), the bad hand blocking the good hand (intermanual interference) (17%), the

sensation that the limb belonged to somebody else (17%) or that the limb was under the control of another agent

(17%). Four of the six patients reporting either of these last two symptoms reported both. We confirmed there

was no association between cognitive impairments, measured with the ACE-R, and both the number of specific

4

(Spearman’s rho = 0.022, p = 0.909) and overall (Spearman’s rho = 0.202, p = 0.294) alien limb phenomena

reported.

Association between alien limb and apraxia

8

We investigated a possible association between alien limb phenomena and limb apraxia in corticobasal

9

syndrome (Fig. 3A), while accounting for age and ACE-R score. First, we conducted a logistic regression

10

analysis to test whether apraxia severity was associated with the occurrence of alien limb in patients. There was

11

no association between praxis score and the emergence of at least one of the specific alien limb symptoms in

12

patients (z = -0.726, p = 0.468; OR = 0.922, 95% CI = 0.727-1.142). The results did not change when we looked

13

at the occurrence of at least one of any of the items in the alien limb questionnaire items (z = -0.052, p = 0.958;

14

OR = 0.992, 95% CI = 0.729-1.327).

15
16

We performed a Bayesian estimation of the logistic regression coefficients for predicting the occurrence of at

17

least one of the specific alien limb symptom (Fig. 3B). This analysis revealed that the probability for increased

18

risk of developing at least one of the specific alien limb phenomena with increasing apraxia severity was 0.225.

19

Model comparison showed that a logistic regression model that did not include apraxia severity as an

20

independent variable was favoured over a model that did, with a Bayesian factor of 3.68 (moderate evidence in

21

favour of the null).

22
23

Next, we examined the phenomenological association between alien limb and apraxia by performing a linear

24

regression analyses on praxis score predicting the number of alien limb symptoms (Fig. 3B). No such

25

association emerged, both when looking at the number of specific alien limb phenomena reported (beta = -

26

0.415, p = 0.078) and the overall number of phenomena reported (beta = -0.265, p = 0.240). A Bayesian

27

estimation of the regression coefficients (Fig. 3C) showed that the probability of apraxia severity positively

28

predicting the number of specific alien limb phenomena reported (i.e. beta > 0) is 0.037. Model comparison

29

showed that a linear regression model that did not include apraxia severity as an independent variable was

30

strongly favoured over a model that did with a Bayesian factor of 689.73 (very strong evidence, by conventional

31

thresholds).

Alien limb and apraxia 9

2

For completeness, we considered a non-linear relationship between alien limb and apraxia by performing non-

3

parametric, ranked partial correlation analyses. No correlation was found between apraxia severity and the total

4

(Spearman’s rho = -0.253, p = 0.194) or specific (Spearman’s rho = -0.358, p = 0.061) alien limb phenomena

5

reported.

6
7

As most of the patients suffered from asymmetric apraxia, we completed the analyses with a Bayesian

8

estimation of regression coefficients with lateralised apraxia score instead of total limb apraxia score. This

9

revealed that the probability for a positive association between unilateral apraxia severity and occurrence of

10

alien limb was 0.019 and 0.039 (specific and any alien limb symptom, respectively). Similarly, the probability

11

for a positive association between unilateral apraxia severity and number of alien limb symptoms reported was

12

0.006 and 0.015 (specific and all alien limb symptoms, respectively).

13
14

DISCUSSION

15

The principal results from this study are although both alien limb and apraxia are common in corticobasal

16

syndrome, severe apraxia does not predict the occurrence of alien limb and there was no association between the

17

number of alien limb phenomena reported and apraxia severity. These results have the caveat that our data

18

emphasise the qualitative features of alien limb phenomena reported by patients, rather than their frequency or

19

severity. We used a structured assessment of both apraxia and alien limb syndrome in order to formalise the

20

assessment of these disorders for analysis and found them to be robust to the presence of another severe extra-

21

pyramidal disorders with involuntary movements: PSP-RS. Whilst our semi-quantative analysis did not address

22

each form of apraxia separately, the composite limb apraxia score included imitation and mime tasks. These are

23

sensitive to both ideomotor and limb-kinetic apraxia and also in the case of mime, ideational apraxia [18]. We

24

first consider the implications of our results for the understanding of alien limb phenomena and apraxia, before

25

considering the relationship between these clinical entities.

26
27

Alien limb phenomena

28

Alien limb phenomena were common in our patients with corticobasal syndrome, with 70% reporting at least

29

one of the six specific phenomena (copying, flotation, unintentional reach, oppositional reach, interference,

30

sense of belonging). In our patients, the actions made by alien limbs appeared semi-purposeful and not

31

perseverative as those described due to other aetiologies [3, 6]. Moreover, none of our patients demonstrated

Alien limb and apraxia 10
1

self-destructive behaviours as those depicted in case reports arising from other aetiologies [40, 41], suggesting

2

that such phenomena are uncommon in corticobasal syndrome.

3
4

A prominent view of alien limb stresses the need for both ‘foreignness’ and involuntary motor activity [2]. On

5

this view, these features are necessary in order to differentiate alien limb phenomena from purely motor

6

disorders, such as dystonia, grasp reflex, athetosis, hemiballismus, hemiataxia and utilisation behaviour, as well

7

as from sensory neglect syndromes [2]. Half of our patients met this definition of an alien hand, experiencing a

8

loss of sense of ownership – that is, the feeling that their hand did not belong to them, together with unwanted

9

movements (i.e. motor phenomena). By contrast, six other patients could be considered to have an ‘anarchic

10

hand syndrome’, as they reported specific motor phenomena while maintaining a sense of ownership [42]. Each

11

of the 15 patients who reported the sensation that their limb did not belong to them also reported at least one

12

specific motor phenomenon. This finding suggests that unwilled motor behaviour may be necessary, but not

13

sufficient for the loss of ownership.

14
15

Longitudinal data will be required to investigate whether alien limb results from a two-step process, where a

16

patient first develops an anarchic limb and subsequently loses their sense of ownership. Importantly, while half

17

of our patients reported a feeling of loss of limb ownership, only a third of these reported a sensation of

18

possession or passivity. Therefore, the type of perceived loss of control observed in our patients is distinct from

19

the classic somatic delusions of control which may be experienced by patients with psychosis, and some

20

reported patients with alien limb syndromes of other etiologies [2, 6, 8, 40, 41].

21
22

More than a third of our patients reported unintentional reaching movements. Reaching and grasping

23

movements of an alien limb have been suggested to result from ‘exaggerated affordance’, in which motor

24

schema are abnormally disinhibited [43]. These motor plans are considered automatic as they are stimulus (e.g.

25

object-) driven, and in the case of alien limb, a failure to inhibit such motor plans leads to unwanted movements

26

[43].

27
28

Apraxia

29

Nearly all patients with corticobasal syndrome were found to be apraxic before the degree of akinesia, rigidity,

30

dystonia or myoclonus precluded interpretation of motor deficits as apraxic. 26/29 of the affected patients had

significant asymmetry in their apraxia. This is consistent with the common presenting complaint (in corticobasal

Alien limb and apraxia 11

syndrome) of unilateral ‘clumsiness’ of hand movements. The impact on mime, imitation and tool use was not

2

simply a function of the complexity of the desired action, suggesting the observed motor deficits in corticobasal

3

syndrome are unlikely to be attributable to limb-kinetic apraxia [18, 25]. Our series also found left-sided

4

predominance of asymmetrical apraxia. This is reminiscent of the apraxia from callosal lesions, which has been

5

attributed to interhemispheric disconnection affecting the transfer of motor programmes from the dominant to

6

non-dominant hemisphere [23].

7
8

Our test battery for apraxia was based on a simple task description (imitation, intransitive and transitive mime),

9

rather than the inferences of ideational, ideomotor and limb-kinetic subtypes. There are several reasons for this.

10

First, we did not assume that the presentations of apraxia would be the same in a chronic degenerative and

11

distributed disease as in acute, focal surgical or stroke lesions. The complexity of motor deficits arising from

12

combined cortical and basal-ganglia degeneration might obscure the classical dissociations and interpretation of

13

apraxic movements [18, 25]. It has been suggested that ideomotor apraxia is the most common apraxia in

14

corticobasal syndrome [19] while ideational apraxia (revealed by identification and recognition) is less common

15

in corticobasal syndrome [18]. It remains uncertain to what extent the poverty of fine finger movements in

16

corticobasal syndrome is attributable to limb-kinetic apraxia as a true form of apraxia, as opposed to other

17

concurrent pyramidal and extrapyramidal impairments [18, 25]. Moreover, limb-kinetic apraxia in corticobasal

18

syndrome often co-exists with ideomotor apraxia [26]. Hence, we opted for a functional description in terms of

19

the tasks and an aggregate score of the deficits rather than subtyping the apraxias in corticobasal syndrome.

20
21

The relationship between alien limb phenomena and apraxia

22

Alien limb and apraxia have been both associated with changes in implicit measures of awareness and control of

23

action [10]. Their co-occurrence and shared anatomical substrates suggested that they might be mechanistically

24

related. However, in our cross-sectional cohort of patients with corticobasal syndrome, we found no association

25

between the occurrence or the number of reported alien limb phenomena and limb apraxia severity. Bayesian

26

analyses and model comparison showed that apraxia severity is very unlikely to be a positive predictor of alien

27

limb symptoms. These results do not support the hypothesis that severe apraxia leads to alien limb. Instead, our

28

findings on the phenomenology of alien limb are consistent with a syndrome in which a patient first presents

29

with an involuntary motor disorder and subsequently develops a sensation of ‘foreignness’ or ‘alienness’. The

30

emergence of the motor phenomena of alien limb, even those which have previously been considered dyspraxic

31

in nature [27, 29], appears to bear no simple association with the current severity of apraxia.

Alien limb and apraxia 12
1
2

The clinical and phenomenological dissociation between apraxia and alien limb phenomena have a number of

3

potential explanations, and implications for the theoretical frameworks accounting for both disorders. Firstly,

4

alien limb and apraxia may have overlapping, but not identical underlying brain lesions [7, 22]. Specifically, the

5

pre-supplementary motor area plays a key role within a prefrontal network critical to both alien limb and

6

apraxia, however, the exact localisation of brain lesions within this network may determine the specific

7

manifestation of alien limb, apraxia or both [10]. A disconnection of this prefrontal network from posterior

8

parietal regions that integrate spatio-temporal signals may lead to apraxia [10, 44], whereas damage to internal

9

feedback loops may lead to an inappropriate activation of motor schema that result in alien limb phenomena [10,

10

43, 45].

11
12

Secondly, different pathological processes may selectively affect the functions of a shared network mediating

13

praxis and voluntary movement. Our patients had clinically defined corticobasal syndrome, with

14

neurodegeneration (rather than metabolic or cerebrovascular disease), but pathological heterogeneity is common

15

within this syndrome [13, 15]. It is conceivable that different pathological mechanisms could cause corticobasal

16

syndromes with different motor disorders, although the presence of corticobasal degeneration vs Alzheimer

17

pathology is not directly distinguished by alien limb or apraxia [13, 15].

18
19

A third possibility is a complex temporal relationship during disease progression in which apraxia and alien

20

limb phenomena develop out of phase. The relationship between apraxia and alien limb phenomena may then

21

not be evident in a cross-sectional study. For example, as praxis worsens, alien limb phenomena might diminish

22

due to their obscuration by dystonia or akinetic-rigidity [46]. In the three patients with serial praxis

23

examinations and alien limb questionnaires, praxis always deteriorated while alien limb phenomena emerged

24

and sometimes disappeared again over time (data not shown). One might speculate that as the pathways which

25

mediate praxis degenerate in corticobasal syndrome, transient imbalances occur between networks for motor

26

control, attention and awareness which lead to manifestations of alien limb phenomena. The independence of

27

corticobasal alien limb phenomena from apraxia may therefore not simply generalise to cases with other

28

aetiologies, such as brain lesions that concurrently affect regions common to both disorders.

29
30

Our study has several limitations. First, unlike the examination of apraxia, our assessment of alien limb

31

symptoms relied on a structured questionnaire. This is because alien limb symptoms are intermittent and hard to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013607; this version posted December 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Alien limb and apraxia 13
1

provoke in the clinic (unlike apraxia). Responses were corroborated by the carer, and we assessed PSP-RS as a

2

control patient group, which as expected reported no alien limb symptoms. Within the corticobasal syndrome

3

group, certain responses were consistently rare, such as sensation of possession, which could serve as negative

4

controls. Second, we quantified the number of distinct alien limb features, not their frequency or functional

5

impact. In pilot work, patients and their companions found reporting of the frequency of paroxysmal alien

6

phenomena difficult. This may reflect lack of awareness of some episodes, recall bias for episodes that were

7

socially distressing, or the influence of other cognitive and motor features on the functional impact of alien limb.

8

Moreover, we prioritised the description of actual alien limb phenomena, which are not operationalised in the

9

current consensus diagnostic criteria [19]. Third, our cross-sectional study is unable to assess the timeline for the

10

development of apraxia and alien limb, for which longitudinal studies are needed.

11
12

CONCLUSIONS

13

Alien limb phenomena and apraxia are both common disorders in the corticobasal syndrome. We describe the

14

phenomenology of alien limb in the corticobasal syndrome, as reported by patients and apraxia as observed by

15

clinicians. Our data do not support the interpretation of alien limb phenomena resulting from apraxia in

16

neurodegenerative disease. There might be qualitative differences from the alien limb phenomena and apraxia

17

following focal brain lesions, but such features are less well characterised than in corticobasal syndrome where

18

alien limb and apraxia are both diagnostic features. Longitudinal and quantitative studies are needed to confirm

19

that the alien limb is a transient feature, whereas apraxia declines continuously, independent from one another.

Figure 1. A) The distribution of apraxia score in corticobasal syndrome patients. Lower

2

scores indicate fewer movements successfully performed (that is – more abnormal

3

behaviour). B) Same as (A) but for the overall number of alien limb phenomena reported by

4

patients (higher number indicates more alien limb symptoms reported).

coefficient for apraxia predicting the occurrence of at least one of the specific alien limb

4

symptoms in the logistic regression analysis, estimated with a Bayesian model fit. Vertical

5

black line indicates the mode. Grey fill indicates 95% credible interval. C) Same as (B) but
