Abstract

11

Background: Red and processed meat has been consistently associated with risk for colorectal

12

cancer, but evidence for other cancer sites is limited and few studies have examined the association

13

between poultry intake and cancer risk. We examined associations between total meat, red meat,

14

processed meat and poultry intake and incidence for 20 common cancer sites.

15

Methods and Findings: We analysed data from 475,023 participants (54% women) in UK Biobank.

16

Participants were aged 37-73 years and cancer free at baseline. Information on meat consumption

17

was based on a touchscreen questionnaire completed at baseline covering type and frequency of

18

meat intake. Diet intake was re-measured a minimum of three times in a subsample (15%) using a

19

web-based 24h dietary recall questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models

20

were used to determine the association between baseline meat intake and cancer incidence. Trends

21

in risk across baseline meat intake categories were calculated by assigning a mean value to each

22

category using estimates from the re-measured meat intakes. During a mean follow-up of 6.9 years,

23

28,955 participants were diagnosed with a malignant cancer. Total, red and processed meat intakes

24

were each positively associated with risk of colorectal cancer (e.g. hazard ratio (HR) per 70 g/day

25

higher intake of red and processed meat combined 1.31, 95%-confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.52).

26

Red meat intake was positively associated with breast cancer (HR per 50 g/day higher intake 1.12,

27

1.01-1.24) and prostate cancer (1.15, 1.03-1.29). Poultry intake was positively associated with risk for

28

cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (HR per 30g/day higher intake 1.16, 1.03-1.32).

29

Only the associations with colorectal cancer were robust to Bonferroni correction for multiple

30

comparisons. Study limitations include unrepresentativeness of the study sample for the UK

31

population, low case numbers for less common cancers and the possibility of residual confounding.

32

Conclusions: Higher intakes of red and processed meat were associated with a higher risk of

33

colorectal cancer. The observed positive associations of red meat consumption with breast and

34

prostate cancer, and poultry intake with cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, require

35

further investigation.

Introduction

51

In 2014, neoplasms overtook cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of death in the UK [1]. In

52

2018, an estimated 446,942 UK citizens were newly diagnosed with cancer; the most common cancer

53

sites were breast, prostate, lung, colorectal cancer and malignant melanoma [2]. Cancer costs the UK

54

£5 billion a year in cancer services and a total of £18.3 billion when including the costs for loss of

55

productivity [3]. Therefore, identifying risk factors that may be targeted for cancer prevention is of

56

great importance.

57

The latest meta-analysis from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) / American Institute for

58

Cancer Research (AICR) concluded that red meat was a probable cause and processed meat a

59

convincing cause of colorectal cancer [4]. However, evidence for associations between red and

60

processed meat intake and cancers at sites other than the colorectum was limited [4]. Furthermore,

61

no conclusions on poultry intake and cancer risk were reached, mainly due to a low number of studies

62

meeting the quality criteria [4]. Similarly, an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)

63

Monographs expert Working Group has classified red meat as Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to

64

humans and processed meat as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans [5]. The IARC review also found

65

some evidence of positive associations with consumption of red meat for cancers of the pancreas and

66

prostate [5]. The interpretation of findings from published studies, however, is challenging due to the

67

heterogeneity in the findings between individual studies, which may be the result of differences in

68

exposure definitions, such as what constitutes processed meat, differences in dietary measurement,

69

the handling of confounders and cohort specifics such as length of follow-up or sample size [6]. By

70

investigating the association between meat intake and multiple cancer sites in the same cohort,

71

definitions and analyses can be standardised and bias in outcome selection based on the results can

72

be eliminated [7-10].

73

The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the associations between intakes of

74

total, red and processed meat (both separately and combined) and poultry and cancer across 20

75

common cancer sites in a large British cohort.

78

The UK Biobank study was established to investigate risk factors for major diseases in middle and

79

older age. Between 2006 and 2010, 9.2 million individuals registered with the UK Health Service in

80

England, Wales and Scotland were invited to participate in the study [11, 12]. In total, 503,317 men

81

and women aged 37-73 years consented to participate and attended the baseline assessment [13].

82

The study was approved by The National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care

83

and the National Health Service North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (reference

84

number 06/MRE08/65), and participants provided informed consent at baseline and to be followed up

85

using data-linkage. By 19 March 2019 781 participants had withdrawn their consent to remain in the

86

study.

87

Exposure assessment

88

Data on dietary intake were collected at recruitment using 29 questions in a self-report touchscreen

89

questionnaire (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/docs/TouchscreenQuestionsMainFinal.pdf). In

90

the touchscreen questionnaire, meat intake was based on five questions concerning processed meat

91

(including both red and white processed meat), and unprocessed meat (poultry, beef, lamb/mutton

92

and pork). Answer options ranged from ‘never’, ‘less than once a week’, ‘once a week’, ‘2-4 times a

93

week’, ‘5-6 times a week’ to ‘once or more daily’, as well as ‘do not know’ and ‘prefer not to answer’.

94

The answer options were coded as intakes of 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5.5 and 7 times/week. Intakes of

95

unprocessed beef, lamb/mutton and pork were combined and classified as red meat intake. To

96

investigate additive effects, red and processed meat intakes were combined as red and processed

97

meat intake, and all meat types including poultry were combined as total meat intake. Meat intakes

98

were categorised into three or four groups depending on distribution and restricted by the answer

99

categories as follows: red meat 0 to <1, 1 to <2, 2 to <4 and ≥ 4 times/week; processed meat 0 to <1

100

time/week, 1 to <2 times a week and ≥ 2 times/week; poultry 0 to <1, 1 to <2 and ≥ 2 times/week; red

101

and processed meat 0 to 1, >1 to <3, 3 to <5 and ≥ 5 times/week; total meat 3, 3 to <5, 5 to <7 and

102

≥7 times/week.

103

From 2009 onwards, a subsample of participants filled out an additional web-based 24h dietary recall

104

questionnaire (the Oxford WebQ) [14, 15]. Mean meat intakes in each category were derived from

105

data in a subsample of participants that had participated repeatedly (minimally 3 times, participant

106

specific means were averaged over the repeated measurements) in the Oxford WebQ and were

107

without a cancer diagnosis at time of data collection (n = 69,076) [14, 16, 17]. These average intakes

108

in the categories for the subsample were then assigned to the intake categories in all participants to

109

calculate trends in risk. Further details on how diet was collected and grouped can be found in S1

Outcome assessment

112

Data on cancer diagnoses were provided by the Medical Research Information Service of the National

113

Health Service (NHS) Information centre (for participants resident in England or Wales) and the

114

Information Services Division of NHS Scotland (for participants resident in Scotland) [18]. The

115

endpoints were first incident cancer diagnosis or cancer recorded in death certificates if no prior

116

diagnosis was registered (all coded using the 10 revision of the World Health Organization’s

117

International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes): oral (C00-14), oesophagus (C15),

118

stomach (C16), colorectum (C18-20) including colon (C18) and rectum (including rectosigmoid

119

junction; C19-20), liver (C22), pancreas (C25), lung (C34), malignant melanoma (C43), breast in

120

women (C50), endometrium (C54), ovary (C56), prostate (C61), kidney (C64-65), bladder (C67),

121

lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (C81-96) and the subgroups non-Hodgkin lymphoma (C82-85),

122

multiple myeloma (C90) and leukaemia (C91-95).

123

Statistical analysis

124

Of 502,536 participants, 27,177 were excluded due to a cancer diagnosis at baseline (excluding non-

125

melanoma skin cancer ICD-10: C44). Additionally, 334 participants were excluded in whom genetic

126

sex differed from reported gender and two participants with zero person years of follow-up, resulting

127

in a maximal study sample of 475,023 participants. Participants who reported ‘prefer not to answer’ or

128

who did not know their meat intake were considered to have missing meat intake and were excluded

129

from the respective analyses (for total meat 1.5%, red and processed meat 1.4%, red meat 1.3%,

130

processed meat 0.4%, and poultry 0.3%). Missing data for the main covariates was minimal with

131

73.5% having no missing data and 94.5% having one or fewer covariates missing; therefore a

132

‘missing’ category was created for each covariate.

133

Each cancer site of interest was treated as a different endpoint for Cox proportional hazards

134

regressions with age as the underlying time variable. The person-years of follow-up were calculated

135

from baseline assessment until the first registration of malignant cancer, date of death due to cancer if

not diagnosed previously, date of death, loss of follow-up or end of follow-up (31 March 2016 for

137

England and Wales, 31 October 2015 for Scotland), whichever came first. Meat intakes were included

138

in the regression models categorically using the lowest intake category as reference, and

139

continuously as a trend in risk expressing the hazard ratios (HR) in increments of 100 g/day for total

140

meat intake, 70 g/day for red and processed meat, 50 g/day for red meat, 20 g/day for processed

141

meat and 30 g/day for poultry (for more details see S1 Text). Covariates were chosen based on the

142

literature for each cancer site, and availability of data at baseline.

143

Minimally adjusted models (Model 0) were stratified by geographical region of baseline assessment

144

centre (6 regions: London, Wales, North-West, North-East, Yorkshire and Humber, West Midlands,

145

East Midlands, South-East, South-West, Scotland), sex, and age group at recruitment (<45, 45-<50,

146

50-<55, 55-<60, 60-<65 and ≥65 years). Subsequently, multivariable models were adjusted for

147

ethnicity (four groups where possible: White, Asian or Asian British, Black or Black British, and Mixed

148

Race or Other; and two groups: White, Non-White for oral, oesophagus, stomach cancer and

172

We conducted three sensitivity analyses: (1) we repeated all analyses excluding the first 2 years of

173

follow-up, to examine whether the overall results might be influenced by reverse causality; (2) we

174

repeated analyses including only those reporting never having smoked at baseline, to reduce residual

175

confounding by smoking; (3) we compared models with and without an interaction term by sex using

176

likelihood-ratio tests, based on earlier findings of sex differences in the associations between meat

177

intake and cancer risk in this cohort [19].

178

Statistical significance was set at the 5% level and for hazard ratios (HRs) 95% confidence intervals

179

(CIs) were calculated. All analyses were performed using Stata release 15.1 [20].

Results

181

Descriptive

182

During a mean follow-up of 6.9 (SD 1.3, maximum 10.1) years, a total of 28,955 participants (6.1%)

183

were newly diagnosed with any type of malignant cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer ICD-

184

10: C44). Table 1 shows characteristics of all participants and those who developed a cancer during

185

follow-up. Participants who developed cancer were older, less physically active and had a higher BMI

186

compared to participants as a whole, more likely to be retired, current or former smokers and heavy

187

alcohol drinkers. Women who developed cancer were more likely to be postmenopausal and to have

188

used HRT. Participants reporting higher meat intakes were more likely to be men, from areas with

189

higher affluence (measured by Townsend score), living with a spouse or partner, former or current

190

smokers, less physically active, to drink more alcohol, to report lower fruit, vegetable and cereal fibre

191

intake, and had a higher BMI (see S2-3 Tables for baseline characteristics by intakes of red and

192

processed meat and poultry).

193

Intakes of different meat types were positively correlated, with a high proportion of those reporting

194

high intakes of one type of meat also reporting high intakes of other types. Of participants who

195

reported high red meat intakes (≥ 4 times/week) 44.4% also reported high processed meat intakes

196

(≥ 2 times/week) and only 2.6% no processed meat intake. Of participants reporting high intakes of

197

poultry (3-<5 times/week) 30.6% also reported high intakes of red and processed meat (≥ 5

198

times/week), while only 4.6% reported eating red and processed meat ≤1 time/week (S3 Table).

199

Main findings

200

Figs 1-5 depict estimated HRs of each individual cancer site associated with an incremental increase

201

in meat intake for the fully adjusted models (Model 2). Tables S4-S8 show estimated HRs by meat

202

intake categories and per incremental increase in intake at three or four levels of adjustment. We

203

report trends in risk where associations showed similar directions to associations by intake

204

categories, and only refer to categorical results if they differed.

205

Total meat intake was positively associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (HR per 100 g/day

206

higher intake 1.28, 95%-CI 1.09-1.51, Ptrend = 0.0022; Fig 1) and colon cancer (1.28, 1.05-1.56,

207

Ptrend = 0.013; Fig 1). There was a positive association between total meat intake and lung cancer risk,

208

but not when current and former smokers were excluded from the analysis (Fig 1).

209

Red and processed meat intake was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer (HR per

210

70 g/day higher intake 1.33, 95%-CI 1.14-1.52, Ptrend = 0.0002; Fig 2) and colon cancer (1.38, 1.16-

211

1.66, Ptrend= 0.0004; Fig 2). There was a positive association between red and processed meat intake

212

and lung cancer risk, but not after exclusion of former and current smokers (Fig 2). In analyses using

213

red and processed meat intake categorically, there were additional associations with malignant

214

melanoma and prostate cancer. Participants who consumed red and processed meat >1 to <3 or 3 to

215

<5 times/week had a higher risk of malignant melanoma compared to those who consumed red and

216

processed meat one or less times/week (HR for intakes >1- <3 times/week 1.27, 95%-CI 1.02-1.58;

217

for intakes 3-<5 times/week 1.40, 1.12-1.74; S5 Table); the risk did not differ in participants who

218

consumed red and processed meat ≥ 5 times/week (HR 1.17, 95%-CI 0.93-1.47; S5 Table). Any red

219

and processed meat intake above one time/week was associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer

220

(HR for intakes >1-<3 times/week 1.18, 95%-CI 1.03-1.34; for intakes 3-<5 times/week 1.18, 1.03-

221

1.35; for intakes ≥ 5 times/week 1.15, 1.01-1.31; reference intake ≤1 time/week; S5 Table).

222

Red meat intake was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer (HR per 50 g/day higher intake

223

1.22, 95%-CI 1.05-1.42, Ptrend = 0.0009; Fig 3), colon cancer (1.34, 1.11-1.61, Ptrend = 0.0021; Fig 3),

224

breast cancer in women (1.12, 1.02-1.24, Ptrend = 0.030; Fig 3) and prostate cancer in men (1.16,

225

1.03-1.30, Ptrend = 0.013; Fig 3). Additional adjustment for enlarged prostate at baseline did not

226

materially change the association between red meat intake and prostate cancer risk (S6 Table). There

227

was a positive association between red meat intake and lung cancer, but not after the exclusion of

228

participants who were current or former smokers (Fig 3). In analyses using red meat intake

229

categorically, participants who consumed 1 to <2 or 2 to <3 times/week had higher risks of malignant

230

melanoma compared to participants who consumed red meat less than one time per week (HR for

231

intakes 1-<2 times/week 1.32, 95%-CI 1.07-1.62; for intakes 2-<3 times/week 1.31, 1.07-1.62; S6

232

Table); the risk did not differ in participants who consumed red meat ≥ 3 times/week (1.09, 95%-CI

233

0.85-1.39; S6 Table).

234

Processed meat intake was positively associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (HR per 20 g/day

235

higher intake 1.18, 95%-CI 1.06-1.31, Ptrend = 0.0022; Fig 4) and rectal cancer (1.26, 1.06-1.51,

236

Ptrend = 0.011; Fig 4). Processed meat intake was positively associated with lung cancer, but not in

237

participants who had never smoked (Fig 4). In analyses using processed meat intake categorically,

238

participants who consumed processed meat 1 to <2 times/week but not higher, had higher risks of

239

breast cancer compared to participants who consumed no processed meat (HR 1.11, 95%-CI 1.01-

240

1.21; for intakes >0-<1 time/week 1.06, 0.97-1.16; for intakes ≥ 2 times/week 1.07, 0.97-1.19; S7

241

Table).

242

Poultry intake was associated with a higher risk of cancers of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues

243

(HR per 30 g/day higher intake 1.16, 95%-CI 1.03-1.32, Ptrend = 0.019; Fig 5). In categorical analyses,

244

participants who consumed poultry once or more times/week had a higher risk of prostate cancer (HR

245

for intakes 1 to <2 times/week 1.11, 95%-CI 1.03-1.20; for intakes ≥ 2 times/week 1.09, 1.00-1.17; S8

246

Table) compared to participants who consumed poultry less than once a week.

247

Sensitivity analyses

248

Associations were largely unchanged when excluding the first 2 years of follow-up (S1 - S5 Figs).

249

Nonetheless, there was an additional association between total meat intake and a higher risk for

Fig). Furthermore, red meat intake was additionally inversely associated with ovarian cancer risk (HR

256

per 50 g/day higher intake 0.63, 95%-CI 0.43-0.94, Ptrend = 0.022; S3 Fig), processed meat intake was

257

no longer associated with the risk of colon cancer (per 20 g/day higher intake of processed meat 1.01,

258

0.84-1.21, Ptrend = 0.91; S4 Fig), and poultry was no longer associated with risk of cancers of

259

lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (per 30 g/day higher poultry intake 1.14, 0.95-1.36, Ptrend = 0.17;

260

261

There was no evidence for heterogeneity by sex except for associations with colorectal, colon and

262

rectal cancer. While in men red and processed meat intake was associated with a higher risk of

263

colorectal cancer (HR per 70 g higher red and processed meat intake 1.51, 95%-CI 1.22-1.86,

264

Ptrend = 0.0001), there was no association in women (1.16, 0.95-1.42, Ptrend = 0.15;

265

Pheterogeneity = 0.0073; S9 Table). There was similarly heterogeneity by sex in the association of red and

266

processed meat with rectal cancer, with no association in women (in women: 0.91, 0.63-1.32,

267

Ptrend = 0.62; in men: 1.44, 1.01, 1.95, Ptrend = 0.042; Pheterogeneity = 0.029; S9 Table). The

268

heterogeneity by sex was less marked for associations with colon cancer (in women: 1.26, 0.99-1.60,

269

Ptrend = 0.057; in men: 1.59, 1.21, 2.09, Ptrend = 0.0009; Pheterogeneity = 0.040, S9 Table). Additionally

270

there was a weak inverse association between poultry intake and rectal cancer in women and a

271

positive association in men (HR per 30 g higher poultry intake in women: 0.73, 95%-CI 0.54-0.99,

272

Ptrend = 0.046; in men: 1.27, 1.00-1.61, Ptrend = 0.049; Pheterogeneity = 0.0033, S9 Table).

273

Discussion

274

In this large British prospective study of 461,986 participants investigating the association between

275

meat intake and common cancer sites, total, red and processed meat intakes were positively

276

associated with risks of colorectal cancer. Additionally, red meat intake was positively associated with

277

breast cancer and prostate cancer, while poultry intake was positively associated with the risk for

278

cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues. However, when accounting for multiple testing

279

using Bonferroni correction, only the associations between intake of total, red and processed meat

280

and colorectal cancer risk, and between intake of red and processed meat and colon cancer risk were

281

robust [21].

282

We found that a 70 g/day higher red and processed meat intake was associated with a 31% greater

283

risk of colorectal cancer and 38% greater risk of colon cancer. This association was in the same

284

direction but of greater magnitude than the results from the WCRF/AICR meta-analysis (Risk ratio

285

(RR) for colorectal cancer 1.12, 95%-CI 1.04-1.21 per 100g/day higher red and processed meat

286

intake), and most more recent research, including a previous study in UK Biobank investigating

287

associations between diet and colorectal cancer with a shorter follow-up and fewer cases [19, 22-27].

288

Comparing the associations with colorectal cancer risk by each meat type, suggests that the

289

association between total meat intake and colorectal cancer was driven by red and processed meat

290

and not by poultry intake. In this study, associations with red meat intake were robust to restricting the

291

sample to never smokers, but associations between processed meat intake and colon cancer

292

disappeared. Most earlier studies that investigated differences in the association between red and or

293

processed intake and colorectal cancer by smoking status reported no differences [28-30], and one

294

study in a Japanese population showed a stronger association between processed meat intake and

295

colon cancer in non-smokers [31]. Furthermore, in the current study associations were only significant

296

in men although there was a suggestive similar direction for risk of colon cancer in women; there was

297

an inverse association between poultry intake and rectal cancer risk in women and a positive

298

association in men. The heterogeneity by sex found in our study was weaker than reported earlier in

299

the same cohort with a smaller number of cases [19]. Women in UK Biobank were less likely to

300

consume meat frequently and had a lower incidence of colorectal cancer, which might have made it

301

more difficult to detect an association. Nevertheless, further investigation of the sex difference is

302

warranted since the difference in risk, especially for rectal cancer, was substantial.

303

In contrast to the findings from the WCRF/AICR, in our study associations with colon cancer were

304

slightly stronger for red meat intake than for processed meat intake. This might be explained by

305

differences in the definition and composition of processed meat between published studies which

306

could affect the range of carcinogenic compounds present. In our study, processed meat included

307

processed white meat, which was not the case in some earlier studies that included red processed

308

meat only; where white meat was included, the proportion of processed meat which was white

309

processed meat is likely to differ by population [22, 32, 33]. Furthermore, red meat eaters and

310

processed meat eaters overlapped strongly, with those reporting high intakes of red meat also

311

reporting high intakes of processed meat. Therefore it might not be possible to differentiate the

312

relative strength of risk associations between red and processed meat. In our study processed meat

313

was more strongly associated with rectal cancer than with colon cancer. This was in contrast with

314

most earlier studies [22], except for one recent study in a Dutch cohort that found an association

315

between processed meat intake and rectal cancer that was similarly strong to what was found in the

316

present study (HR per 25 g/day higher intake 1.36, 95%-CI 1.01-1.81) [27]; this might be explained by

317

reasons similar to those described above.

318

Several pathways have been suggested by which both red meat and processed meat could increase

319

the risk of colorectal cancer. Haem iron in red meat can catalyse the N-nitrosation of amines and

320

amides to N-Nitroso compounds (NOCs) endogenously, which can generate mutations in the gastro-

321

intestinal mucosa [34-37]. In experimental studies, haem iron has furthermore been shown to lead to

322

lipid peroxidation that could induce genetic mutations in intestinal epithelial cells, and to affect the gut

323

microbiota in ways which could trigger tumorigenesis through low-grade inflammation [36, 38]. Meat

324

processing and cooking can additionally result in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

325

(PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which may increase the risk of colorectal cancer [39, 40].

326

Furthermore, processed red meat can contain NOCs from the addition of sodium nitrite and nitrates

327

for preservation [40-42].

328

Although we found positive associations of total, red and processed meat intake with lung cancer,

329

these results may be due to residual confounding by smoking, as these associations were null in

330

never smokers. Very few cohort studies have investigated associations between meat intake and lung

331

cancer stratified by smoking status, and results from case-control studies that suggest an apparent

332

association in never smokers could be affected by recall bias [43]. Given that smoking is a very strong

333

risk factor for lung cancer, it is likely that statistical adjustment for smoking status is insufficient to

334

control for confounding by smoking, which is positively correlated with meat intake. Future studies

335

reporting findings stratified by smoking status are needed to clarify whether any true association

336

between meat and lung cancer exists or whether the apparent associations are entirely due to

337

residual confounding.

338

We also found that red meat intake was positively associated with breast cancer and prostate cancer

339

risk, and poultry intake with the risk for cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues; however,

340

these associations were not robust against correction for multiple testing. The associations with

341

breast cancer were broadly similar to that found in the WCRF meta-analysis [44]. Of three more

342

recent studies that also found positive associations [17, 45, 46], two considered these associations

343

non-significant as a result of stricter significance criteria [17, 46]. It should be noted that our findings

344

contrast somewhat with earlier research by Anderson et al. in the same cohort (UK Biobank), that

345

found no association between red meat intake and breast cancer risk, but did find an association with

346

processed meat intake [47]. We believe the differences from the current study are most likely due to a

347

longer follow-up and larger number of cases in our study, but may also be due to differences in

348

dietary data processing and analyses. The association in the current study of red meat with prostate

349

cancer risk is consistent with some but not all previous research; the WCRF/AICR meta-analysis and

350

more recent studies found no association between red meat intake and prostate cancer risk, while the

351

IARC review noted a possible positive association with prostate cancer risk [5, 45, 48]. Finally, the

352

association between poultry intake and cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, which

353

seemed to be driven mainly by NHL, was consistent with results from the European Prospective

354

Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in which higher poultry intake was associated with an

355

increased risk of NHL [49]. Yet, two US studies found no association between poultry intake and NHL

356

[50, 51]. Further research in large cohorts is needed to investigate the association between meat

357

intake and these cancer sites.

358

Strengths and limitations

359

Major strengths of this study are the prospective design and the large sample size, which allowed

360

investigation of a wide range of cancer sites chosen a priori to eliminate outcome selection bias. Data

361

linkage to cancer registries reduced the risk of outcome misclassification and selective drop-out.

362

Random error in dietary intakes was reduced by calibrating intakes using repeat measurements from

363

24h recall data to estimate usual dietary intakes in each intake category [16, 17]. Furthermore,

364

associations were robust after adjustment for a wide range of potential confounders. Finally, the risk

365

of reverse causation was reduced in sensitivity analyses excluding the first 2 years of follow-up, and

366

the risk of residual confounding by smoking was addressed in sensitivity analyses restricted to never

367

smokers.

368

Nevertheless, limitations need to be considered in the interpretation of our results. This study was not

369

representative of the UK population, therefore selection bias might still have some impact on the

14

370

findings, but exposure-disease relationships are likely to be generalizable because they have been

371

shown to not require representativeness [13, 52]. Although the study was based on large case

372

numbers for the most common cancers, it is possible that we did not have enough power to detect

373

associations in less common cancer sites. Also, this study did not consider subtypes of cancer sites

374

such as subsites in stomach cancer or tumour characteristics, as this information is not yet available

375

in UK Biobank. Another limitation was the method of dietary assessment; the touchscreen

376

questionnaire did not allow the calculation of total energy intake. We accounted for confounding by

377

other dietary factors by adjusting for total fruit, vegetable and cereal fibre intake, and models were

378

adjusted for BMI and physical activity [53]; however residual confounding could still operate [54].

379

Conclusions

380

The present study supports earlier findings of an association between red and processed meat intake

381

and colorectal cancer. More research is needed regarding the positive associations between poultry

382

intake and cancers of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, and between red meat intake and risks of

383

breast and prostate cancer.
