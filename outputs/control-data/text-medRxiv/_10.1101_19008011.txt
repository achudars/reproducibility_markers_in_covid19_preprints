Abstract

Objective:

To evaluate whether early life adiposity has an independent effect on later life

disease risk or whether its influence is mediated by adulthood body mass index (BMI).

Design:
Setting:

Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization.

The UK Biobank (UKB) prospective cohort study and four large-scale genome-

wide association study (GWAS) consortia.

Participants:

453,169

participants

enrolled

in

the

UKB

and

a

combined

total

of

over

700,000 individuals from different GWAS consortia.

Exposures:

Measured BMI during adulthood (mean age: 56.5) and self-reported adiposity

at age 10.

Main outcome measures:

Coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), breast

cancer and prostate cancer.

Results:

there was strong evidence of a protective direct effect for early BMI (OR:0.59, 95% CI:0.50-

0.71), although adult BMI did not appear to have a direct effect on this outcome (OR:1.08,

direct causal effect, independent of early and adult BMI (MVMR OR:0.90, 95% CI:0.85-

0.95). Weak evidence of a causal effect was observed in the MVMR analysis of prostate

cancer (early life BMI OR:1.06, 95% CI:0.81-1.40, adult BMI OR:0.87, 95% CI:0.70-1.08).

Conclusions:

Our findings suggest that increased CAD and T2D risk attributed to early life

adiposity can be mitigated if individuals reduce their weight in later life. However, having a

low BMI during childhood may increase risk of breast cancer regardless of changes to

weight in later life, with timing of puberty also putatively playing an important role.

We postulate that, if early life BMI has a causal influence on disease risk, then there are

likely 3 main categories that such effects could be grouped into after accounting for adult

BMI in a multivariable framework (Figure 1). Firstly, the influence of early life BMI on

disease risk may be mediated by later life BMI. As such, early life BMI only has an indirect

effect on disease risk via adult BMI, which for example could be attributed to individuals

with a high BMI at age 10 remaining overweight into adulthood (Figure 1-1). Secondly,

early life BMI may have only an independent (i.e. direct) effect on disease risk, which is not

mediated through adult BMI (Figure 1–2), or it may also be plausible that BMI at separate

timepoints may both influence disease risk via alternate causal pathways (i.e. early life BMI

has both a direct and an indirect effect on outcome, Figure 1–3). Additional descriptions of

Methods
The UK Biobank and disease outcome datasets

Between 2006 to 2010 the UK Biobank study enrolled 500,000 individuals aged between

Data were

derived using height (measured in whole centromeres) and weight (to the nearest 0.1kg) at

baseline. Participants were also asked ‘When you were 10 years old, compared to average

would

you

yourself

as

or

Hereafter

these

measures are referred to as ‘adult BMI’ and ‘early life BMI’ respectively.

Adult

BMI

was

converted into a categorical variable with 3 groups based on the same proportions as the

early life BMI variable (i.e. ‘thinner’, ‘plumper’ and ‘about average’). This was to ensure that

both measures were as comparable as possible. Effect estimates from our results can be

interpreted as the increase in odds conferred per additive change in BMI category.

In total,

Effect estimates on early life BMI were used for the

analysis with additional adjustment for month of birth. However, the “total” effect of adult

BMI should be interpreted with caution. There is likely to be strong correlation between

genetic determinants of early and adult BMI, and thus the total effect of adult BMI is likely

to suffer from what will manifest as pleiotropy if there is also a direct effect of early BMI on

the outcome. In the main manuscript we only discuss the total effect of early BMI, and

direct effects of early and adult BMI, for this reason. A direct acyclic graph illustrating

direct, indirect and total effects as investigated within a multivariable MR framework can

be found in Supplementary Figure 1.

Multivariable MR analyses were undertaken to estimate the direct effect of early life BMI

on each outcome in turn. Variants from the univariable analysis were used again here after

Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses
Univariable analyses provided strong evidence that early life BMI is associated with CAD
risk (UVMR OR:1.49, 95% CI:1.33-1.68). However, the direct effect of early life BMI (i.e. not
mediated via adult BMI) was much smaller than the total effect (MVMR OR:1.02, 95%
CI:0.86-1.22), whereas strong evidence of a direct effect was identified for adult BMI
(OR:1.82, 95% CI:1.59-2.09). Similar findings were identified for analyses on T2D, as the
magnitude of the direct causal effect for early life BMI was much smaller than the total
effect when modelled simultaneously with adult BMI (early life BMI OR:1.16, 95% CI:0.741.82, adult BMI OR:2.80, 95% CI:1.89-4.15). Effect estimates from both univariable and
multivariable MR analyses are illustrated in Figure 3 and a full list can also be found in
Supplementary Table 12.
The negative control analysis with age at menarche as an outcome provided strong
evidence in the univariable analysis that early life BMI influences timing of puberty (Beta:0.93, 95% CI:-0.66 to -1.20). Including adult BMI in a multivariable framework along with
childhood BMI found that the direct effect estimate for childhood BMI was essentially
unchanged, whilst adulthood BMI was not seen to influence age of menarche (Table 1).
These findings reflect the scenario depicted in Supplementary Figure 2, suggesting that
early life BMI can only effect timing of puberty directly and not indirectly via adult BMI
(given that it occurs at an earlier timepoint in life course).
For breast cancer, there was strong evidence in the univariable analysis that higher
genetically predicted early life BMI leads to reduced risk of this outcome (OR:0.63, 95%
CI:0.55-0.72). Analysing both measures of BMI in a multivariable framework found that the
indirect effect estimate via adult BMI (OR:1.08, 95% CI:0.93-1.27) was smaller in
magnitude than the direct protective effect of early life BMI (OR:0.59, 95% CI:0.50-0.71).
Similar findings were identified in the analysis of ER-positive and ER-negative cases of
breast cancer (Supplementary Table 13).

Evaluating the relationship between genetically predicted age at menarche and breast
cancer in a univariable analysis provided weak evidence of a total effect (OR:0.98, 95%
CI:0.90-1.06). However, when modelled together with both early and adult BMI (i.e. all 3
exposures in the multivariable model) there was strong evidence that later age at
menarche may lower the risk of breast cancer (OR:0.90, 95% CI:0.85-0.95). Effect estimates
for predicted early life BMI had a larger effect in this multivariable analysis compared to
the direct effect of adult BMI (Table 1). There was very weak evidence that early life BMI
has a predicted causal effect on prostate cancer either directly (OR:1.06, 95% CI:0.81-1.40).
or indirectly via adult BMI (OR:0.87, 95% CI:0.70-1.08).
Early life BMI is self-reported later in life and so is likely to be subject to misclassification
which will not affect our measure of adult BMI. We therefore conducted a simulation to
identify how such misclassification, affecting only one exposure, will influence the effect
estimation in our multivariable MR analyses. Our results (see Supplementary Note 1) show
that misclassification weakens the strength of association between the SNPs and our
measure of early life BMI and so potentially biases the estimated effect of early life BMI in
our multivariable MR analysis but does not introduce bias into the estimated effect
between later life BMI and the outcomes. The results also show even with misclassification
the effect of early life BMI in the multivariable MR estimation is not biased when it has a
null effect on the outcome.

In this study we have examined the influence of early life adiposity on disease risk and
whether this putative causal effect occurs independently (“direct effect”) or via the same
causal pathway (“indirect effect”) as later life BMI. Our univariable MR analysis suggested
that genetically predicted early life BMI increases risk of coronary artery disease and type
2 diabetes. However, when analysed together with adult BMI in a multivariable framework
the direct effect estimates for early life BMI were of considerably reduced and essentially
null magnitude in comparison to the estimates of the total effects, suggesting that its
influence on these outcomes is mediated by later life BMI (as portrayed in the ‘Indirect
effect of early life BMI only’ diagram in Figure 1). These findings imply that observed
associations between early life obesity and increased coronary artery disease and type 2
diabetes risk are likely attributed to individuals with a high BMI during childhood
remaining overweight into later life. This suggests that a window of opportunity exists to
mitigate the detrimental impact of early life BMI on risk of these disease outcomes35 36. This
corroborates findings from some previous research suggesting that there is no persistent
influence of childhood obesity on risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, unless
adiposity is sustained37 38. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance taking into
account adult BMI in order to assess whether childhood adiposity has a direct or persistent
effect on disease risk over the life course39 40.

Our results also provide strong evidence that early life BMI has a protective effect on breast
cancer risk as has been previously reported by both observational and MR studies which
have not previously taken into account adult BMI41-44. This was identified both as a total
and direct effect using univariable and multivariable MR analyses respectively, suggesting
that the effect of early life BMI may persist into later life regardless of any interventions
that influence BMI variation. Furthermore, reported protective effect estimates between
later life BMI and breast cancer risk may be attributed to effects from childhood. We note
however that this effect requires further investigation in subpopulations of pre- and post-

menopausal breast cancer patients from large-scale GWAS. This is particularly crucial given
observational evidence suggesting that higher BMI increases the risk of invasive breast
cancer in post-menopausal women45.

As an additional validation of our multivariable framework, we undertook a negative
control analysis to investigate the effect of early life BMI on at menarche in both a
univariable and multivariable framework accounting for adult BMI. We found that
estimates were consistent from both analyses for early life BMI, whereas the effect
estimates for adult BMI in the multivariable analyses had a much smaller magnitude of
effect in comparison. This provides a powerful proof of concept for our analytical
framework, given that BMI can only influence timing of puberty in early life whereas adult
BMI cannot as it occurs earlier in the life course.

We also undertook an additional analysis to investigate timing of puberty with respect to
the putative predictive effect of early life BMI on breast cancer risk. To do this, we
incorporated age at menarche as an additional exposure in our multivariable MR analysis.
Our findings corroborate similar analyses undertaken using a multivariable framework,
which suggests that later age at menarche has a protective effect on breast cancer risk but
only when accounting for early life BMI46. However, there is strong evidence from the
literature of a relationship between timing of puberty and later life BMI47 48. Notably, our
results build upon previous findings by modelling age 10 and adult BMI as two separate
exposures, due to the direct effect of age 10 BMI providing strong evidence of a protective
effect when accounting for age at menarche. Similar observational findings have been
reported recently in premenopausal women after adjusting for age at menarche49.
Developing insight into the underlying biological mechanisms explaining this effect may
therefore have important therapeutic implications.

We were unable to support previous evidence of an effect between genetically predicted
BMI and prostate cancer risk50 51. This relationship is notoriously complex due to the effect
of obesity on various hormones in males, such as an inverse relationship with prostate
specific antigen52 and a positive relationship with estrogen concentrations53. This outcome

is therefore worth revisiting using forthcoming findings from large-scale GWAS of prostate
cancer when they become available, using this study’s analytical framework. A greater
number of genetic instruments in males only is also likely to improve power for future
endeavours. Evaluating the influence of pubertal development on this outcome would also
be a worthwhile undertaking54.

We used univariable Mendelian randomization to estimate total effects of early BMI, and
multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate direct effects of early and adult BMI. In
theory, the univariable estimate of the effect of adult BMI (the total effect) and the
multivariable estimate (the direct effect) should be equal. However, if some genetic
variants cause both early and adult BMI (albeit with different effect sizes), and early BMI
has a direct effect on the outcome, then this will potentially generate pleiotropy in the
univariable estimate of adult BMI. This can be seen in the univariable estimate of the effect
of adult BMI on breast cancer, which is quite different to the multivariable estimate,
probably due to the direct effect of early BMI on breast cancer. For CAD, where there is no
direct effect of early BMI on the outcome, then the univariable and multivariable effects of
adult BMI are the same. This demonstrates one of the issues with Mendelian randomization
of time-varying exposures – the univariable analyses cannot identify critical or sensitive
periods of exposure, but only an effect of a difference in the cumulative lifetime exposure55

56. Moreover, As outlined in all the diagrams depicted in Figure 1, we assume that
childhood BMI has an effect on adulthood BMI in all scenarios. Therefore, individuals who
(for example) lower their BMI between childhood and adulthood may effectively break this
mediated causal chain and reduce their elevated risk of diseases such as coronary heart
disease or type 2 diabetes.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The key strengths of our investigation include the large number of individuals from the UK
Biobank study with measures of both early and later life adiposity (n=453,169). This
sample size is unprecedented compared to previous endeavours in the field, although we
note that a caveat to this is having to rely on questionnaire-based data for the age 10

variable. As such there will likely be additional measurement error when analysing this
exposure. The statistical power in our GWAS therefore comes at the expense of precision,
although despite this we were able to recapitulate evidence of association between genetic
variants and early life BMI measurements in the literature57 58.

Harnessing large-scale summary statistics from GWAS using two-sample MR is another
strength of this study. This circumvents the necessity of having both our exposures and
outcomes measured in the same sample. Moreover, along with using genetic variants to
mitigate

framework has enabled us to investigate the independent effect of early life BMI, which is
extremely challenging in an observational setting. Furthermore, although we have focused
on 5 outcomes in this study, future work can adopt a similar approach to us for any
outcomes of interest for which there are accessible GWAS summary statistics.

Our univariable analysis used all the SNPs associated with each exposure. Although there
are variations in the SNPs associated with each of early life and adult BMI there is also
considerable overlap in the SNPs associated with each timepoint. Our univariable MR
analyses therefore capture pleiotropic effects of the SNPs through the other time point as
well as, for childhood BMI, the effect mediated by adult BMI. This is a limitation of our
univariable MR analyses but highlights the importance of the multivariable MR to
disentangle the direct effects of child and adult BMI.

A limitation that should be taken into consideration when interpreting our results is that it
is possible that participants from the UK Biobank may have also contributed to the largescale GWAS whose results were used in this study. Overlapping exposure and outcome
samples in a two-sample MR analysis may result in overfitting, although currently there is
no way to robustly discern whether this is the case unless anonymous identifiers between
the UK Biobank and GWAS consortium can be linked together59.

Conclusions
Using

multivariable

Mendelian

randomization,

we

have

provided

strong

evidence

suggesting that early life adiposity has a causal influence on breast cancer risk that acts
independently of later life body mass index. Conversely, our results suggest that the
positive association between early life adiposity and both coronary artery disease and type
2 diabetes is likely due to individuals with a high body mass index remaining overweight in
later life. Our approach therefore yields insight into the mechanistic pathway between
early life risk factors such as body mass index and disease outcomes. Furthermore, it
provides scope to differentiate between effects where the conferred risk may not be
reversable by achieving and maintain a healthy body mass index in adulthood.

What is already known on this topic?
-

Childhood obesity is known to have a detrimental impact on various health
conditions and disease risk in later life.

-

Body mass index in early life has been associated with increased odds of coronary
artery disease and type 2 diabetes observationally, but whether this effect is
immutable or whether lifestyle modifications can help mitigate it is unclear.

-

The influence of early life body mass index on risk of other diseases, such as breast
cancer

and

prostate

cancer,

has

been

previously

reported

but

the

causal

relationships underlying these observations are complex and require further
evaluation.

What this study adds?
-

The influence of early life body mass index on odds of coronary artery disease and
type 2 diabetes was predominantly mediated through later life adiposity, suggesting
that individuals can reduce the impact of any conferred risk by reducing their
relative weight as they enter adolescence.

-

Body mass index at age 10 had a protective effect on breast cancer risk which is
independent of later life adiposity, although timing of puberty likely also plays a
causal role in this relationship.

-

Although in this study we have focused on cardiometabolic and cancer outcomes,
the analytical approach we have used has considerable potential to investigate how
risk factors trajectories across life influence different types of health outcomes.
