Abstract
Objectives: Identification of osteoarthritis(OA)-specific synovial inflammatory pathways, and when in
the clinical course they are active, is critical for their utility as therapeutic targets. We directly
compared the mononuclear inflammatory/immune-cell responses following joint injury that does and
does-not lead to OA, to define bona-fide OA-associated cellular events.
Methods: We undertook detailed temporal flow-cytometric and mRNA expression analysis in mice
after sham or medial-meniscal-destiblization (DMM) surgery. We compared this with patients with
meniscal injury and OA, and evaluated the role of synovial monocytes/macrophages versus
lymphocytes in catabolic metalloproteinase secrection in vitro. We determined the effect of transient
acute or delayed systemic T-cell depletion on DMM-induced OA pathology.
Results:

OA-inducing/DMM

and

had

identical

synovial

monocyte/macrophage number, activation and polarization. The number and activation of synovial (not
splenic or peripheral-blood) CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes was increased from 1-day after DMM versus
Sham, and showed a persistent cyclical elevation throughout OA onset and progression. There was a
temporal imbalance in synovial Th17/Treg and Th1/Th2 lymphocytes during DMM-induced OA
initiation and progression. We confirmed early post-injury and late-OA CD3/CD8 T-cell responses in
synovial tissues from patients, identified an association between CD8 and early post-injury symptoms,
and defined a significant role for CD3+T-cells in synovial metalloproteinase secretion. Anti-CD3 celldepletion studies in mice confirmed a key role for the earliest post-injury T-cell response in long-term
OA pathology.
Conclusions: We identify a hitherto unappreciated pathophysiological role of acute T-cell activation
after joint injury in long-term post-traumatic OA risk, providing a novel diagnostic and therapeutic
target.

Key Messages
What is already known about this subject?
The presence of synovitis/joint-inflammation increases the risk not only of osteoarthritis (OA)
progression but incident disease. While numerous inflammatory effectors including macrophages and
lymphocytes have been identified in OA, their disease-specificity, temporal regulation, and association
with risk of pathology onset and progression is lacking.

How does this study add?
By directly comparing the mononuclear inflammatory/immune-cell responses following significant
joint injury that does (medial-meniscal-destabilization; DMM) and does-not (Sham-surgery) lead to
OA in mice, we have defined bona-fide OA-associated cellular events. There was no difference in
synovial or systemic monocyte/macrophage cell number, activation or polarization between DMM and
Sham, both showing a successful wound-healing response. In contrast, increases in number and
activation of synovial Th1- and Th17-CD4, and CD8 T-cells in DMM compared with Sham occurred
within the first 3 days, and while recurring cyclically through subsequent disease onset, depletion
studies indicated this initial influx was key to long-term ptOA risk.

How might this impact on clinical practice of future developments?
Acute increases in synovial T-cells following jont injury may be both a novel marker of OA risk, and a
target to reduce long term structural damage.

Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 12-15% of the population causing enormous individual and socioeconomic
burden, with no treatments to halt disease onset or progression.[1, 2] Studies in patients and pre-clinical
models have implicated OA-associated synovitis as a potential disease-modifying target.[3-8] Synovial
inflammatory mediators are more elevated in early OA,[9-11] and patients with synovitis/joint-effusion
have faster progression, and more incident OA.[12-14] That inflammation impacts disease initiation is
supported by animal studies where synovitis precedes structural hip OA in at-risk dogs,[15] and
modulation of specific inflammatory molecules/pathways reduces post-traumatic (pt)OA onset as well
as progression in mice.[16] Better understanding of OA-specific inflammation may lead to much
needed disease-modifying therapeutics.
Numerous inflammatory effectors have been identified in OA,[3-7] but detailed knowledge of their
temporal regulation and association with pathology is lacking, particularly for innate and adaptive
immune-cellular responses. Macrophages[17, 18] and lymphocytes[19-22] have been implicated in
structural and symptomatic disease as they are present in OA-patient synovium. However, restricted
access to preclinical patient samples means the inflammatory-cell events occurring during disease
initiation are poorly defined. Occurring after known injury, ptOA offers the potential to study the
earliest phases of synovial inflammation,[23] but comparison with “non-OA-inducing” joint injury has
not been possible in clinical studies.[24-28]
Surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) in mice is a widely used pre-clinical model for
investigating ptOA pathobiology and treatment.[29] A key role for specific inflammatory pathways in
initiation and progression of DMM-induced ptOA has been demonstrated using genetically-modified
mice.[16] We now define a distinct temporal pattern of inflammatory cell influx during initiation and
progression of DMM-induced ptOA, that was reflected in meniscal-injury patients, and could be
targeted

Methods
DMM model
Studies were approved by the institutional ethics committee (protocol 1106-012A). Male 10-11-weekold, C57BL6 mice were sourced, housed, and DMM-surgery performed in one knee and Sham-surgery
in the other as described.[30, 31] Mice received no post-operative medication, had unrestricted cageactivity, and were sacrificed at day-1, -3, -7, -14, -21, -28, -35, -42, -49, -56, -72, -84, -98 and -112
post-surgery (n=16-22/time). At selected times, age- and sex-matched naïve mice were sacrificed as
non-operated-controls (NOC; n=16-22/time). Additional mice had bilateral Sham- or DMM-surgery
and were sacrificed at day-14, -42, -84 and -112 post-surgery (n=16/time/group) to evaluate
mononuclear cell (MC) changes in peripheral blood (PBMC) and spleen (SpMC). Another cohort of
mice (n=20/treatment/time) received a single intra-peritoneal injection of 20µg anti-CD3 (145-2C11;
Biolegend) or isotype-control (Armenian-Hamster IgG; Biolegend) 1-week before or 3-weeks after
unilateral-DMM, and were sacrificed at day-14, -28, -56, and -112 post-surgery. Eight mice/treatmentgroup had tactile allodynia measured before and at specified times post-DMM.[32]

Joint sample preparation
Immediately post-sacrifice synovial tissue (ST: infra-patellar fat-pad + joint capsule + synovial lining)
was micro-dissected en-bloc.[30] ST from 6 NOC, Sham and DMM joints at day-7, -14, -35, -49 and 112 were used for qRT-PCR [30, 31] to quantify expression of Cd3, Cd4, Cd8, Il1, Il6, and Tnf relative
to Gapdh (mouse-specific primers; Supplementary Table I). ST from 16 animals/group were used for
flow-cytometry (4 “biological-replicates”/timepoint consisting of pooled ST from 4 mice). After ST
removal, remaining joint tissues were processed and sagittal sections every 80µm through the medial
femoro-tibial joint stained with toluidine-blue/fast-green for histopathology scoring.[30, 31]

Flow-cytometry
PBMCs, SpMCs, and STMCs were isolated, live cells counted, and subtypes quantified using cell
surface markers (Figure 2&3).[30] A total of 105 events were collected (four-colour flow-cytometer;
Becton-Dickinson),

Viable

(7-

aminoactinomycin-D-negative) CD45+ MCs were gated on forward/side scatter as monocytic (CD11b+)
or lymphocytic (CD3+) then: CD11b+F4/80-Ly6c+ resident-monocytes, CD11b+F4/80+Ly6chigh
inflammatory-monocytes, CD11b+F4/80+Ly6clow activated-macrophages (M1(F4/80+CD11c+) or
M2(F4/80+CD206+)),

CD3+CD4+CD8- T-helper, and CD3+CD4-CD8+ cytotoxic-T-cells. For

intracellular staining, cells were stimulated (5h, 50ng/ml phorbol-myristate-acetate, 1μg/ml ionomycin,
BD-Biosciences) before addition of brefeldin-A (5μg/ml, 5h; Sigma-Aldrich). Following surfacemarker staining, cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with BV-421-labelled-anti-IFN-γ (“Th1”),
APC-labelled-anti-IL-4 (“Th2”), PE-labelled-anti-IL-17A (“Th17”) or Alexa-488-labelled-anti-FoxP3
(“Treg”).

Human samples
Suprapatellar ST collected in the course of previous studies from three patient cohorts (Supplementary
information) were analysed: 16 “advanced knee OA”,[24] 19 “meniscal-tear early-OA”,[24, 33] and 13
“meniscal-tear no-OA”.[26, 27] Aliquots of RNA from de-identified patients were provided with
clinical data (Supplementary Table II), and CD3, CD4 and CD8 quantified by qRT-PCR (humanspecific primers; Supplementary Table I).
ST from 12 OA patients undergoing uni-compartmental or total knee replacement (University Hospital
Heidelberg; ethics #S-156/2014; Supplementary Table III), were digested (collagenase B [Roche],
6.7µg/mg 37°C 2hr), and MCs isolated by centrifugation. Magnetic-activated-cell-sorting depletion of
CD45+, CD14+ or CD3+ cells was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec).

Native and depleted samples were cultured (24 hours, RPMI/10%-FCS/1%-Penicillin-Streptomycin;
106 cells/ml), and the concentration of MMP-1 (Sigma-RAB0361-1KT), MMP-3 (Sigma-RAB03671KT), MMP-9 (Sigma-RAB0372-1KT), and ADAMTS-5 (LOXO-6SEK205HU) in conditioned media
quantified by ELISA.

Statictical Analysis
The minimum number of animals and/or biological replicates to detect differences with >80% power
(two-sided, alpha 0.05) was determined a priori using previous data:[30, 31, 34] n = 5/group for
histopathology, n = 4/group for FACS, n = 6/group for gene expression, and n = 8/group for
mechanical allodynia. Animals were randomly assigned to groups, and investigators were blinded to
these during data acquisition. Data from all animals and human subjects was used for analysis (no
outlier removal), with the number of replicates provided in methods, figure legends and tables.
Following QQ plots and Shapiro-Wilk tests, normally distributed data (flow-cytometry, ELISA) was
analysed by ANOVA with Bonferroni and Tukey correction, while non-parametric outcomes
(histopathology, gene-expression) were evaluated using Friedman tests (Prism, GraphPad). Spearman
correlations between clinical outcomes and mRNA expression were calculated using SPSS (IBM Inc).
For all analyses p≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
OA histopathology
Progressively worsening medial femoro-tibial OA pathology including signficanty greater cartilage
proteoglycan loss and structural damage, subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophyte formation was
seen in DMM versus NOC (from day-7) and Sham (from day-14) (Figure 1).

Synovial mononuclear cell number
The number of STMCs in NOC did not change over time (P=0.84). STMCs increased markedly 1-day
following Sham and DMM, with cyclical decreases (day-3, -28, -56 and -84) and increases (day-14, -35
and -70) thereafter (Figure 2A). Resolution phases were greater and increases less in Sham, such that
numbers returned to NOC levels after day-21, while remaining elevated in DMM versus NOC (day-170), and Sham (day-3-49).

Monocytes/macrophages
Frequency of systemic CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages were similar in NOC, Sham and DMM:
41.6±27.1%, 35±17.5% and 30.6±12.9% of PBMC, respectively; 6.9±0.6%, 9.8±1.5%, and 5.8±0.6%
of SpMC, respectively; no temporal differences within any group. This also applied to systemic
CD11b+ subtypes: Ly6c+resident-monocytes (NOC:43.7±11%, Sham:49±13%, DMM:44±10%),
F4/80+Ly6chighinflammatory-monocytes (NOC:26.6±3%, Sham:30.4±6%, DMM:29.1±3.5%), and
F4/80+Ly6clowactivated-macrophages (NOC:19.8±7.8%, Sham:17.5±6.8%, DMM:23.1±6.3%). In
contrast, CD11b+ STMCs increased immediately post-surgery followed by diminishing cyclical peaks
(day-3, -28, -56, and -112), but with no difference between Sham and DMM (Figure 2C). Residentmonocytes made up 60-80% of CD11b+ STMCs in NOC at all times, but decreased acutely in Sham
and DMM (<20% by day-3) before returning to NOC levels (day-28-35; Figure 2D). Inflammatorymonocytes were elevated immediately post-surgery before returning to NOC levels at day-35 (Figure
2E). Activated-macrophages peaked 3-7 days post-surgery before returning to NOC levels at day-21
(Figure 2F). There was no difference between Sham and DMM in any subtype at any time.
Polarization of ST-macrophages into M1 and M2 subtypes showed distinct temporal patterns in NOC
versus DMM and Sham, but no diference between surgeries (Figure 2G). In NOC the majority of STmacrophages expressed neither marker up to day-56 (M0:57-74%), with 17-26% M1, 8-14% positive

for both (M1/2), and only 0.1-2.5% M2. With ageing (day-112) increases in M1 (36%) and M1/2
(39%) occurred in NOCs. In both DMM and Sham there was a marked increase in M1 at day-1 (7276%), followed by a temporal transition to M1/2 (75-83% at day-7), M2 (66-73% by day-56), and
thereafter to day-112 NOC levels.

Lymphocytes
There was a cyclic increase in ST-lymphocytes after surgery (Figure 3): peaks at day-7, -35, and -98.
The percentage of ST-CD3+-lymphocytes did not differ between Sham and NOC at any time but was
greater in DMM than NOC (day-1-98), and Sham (day-1-14; Figure 3C). As a percentage of the CD3+lymphocytes, CD4+-T-cells were increased in DMM compared with NOC and Sham from day-1-112
(Figure 3E). While showing similar cyclic fluctuation, the percentage of CD8+-T-cells did not differ
between DMM and Sham (Figure 3G). However, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers (rather than
%) were greater in DMM versus Sham from day-1-84 (Figure 3D, F, H).
Splenic and ST T-helper cells were further categorized post-DMM as Th1(IFN+), Th2(IL-4+), Th17(IL17+) or Treg(FoxP3+) (Figure 4A). The percentage of all subtypes was almost always lower in the
spleen, and when this was not the case anti-inflammatory cell-types predominated (Table I). There was
little change in splenic CD4+ subtypes over time (all <5%; Figure 4B), and pro-inflammatory
imbalances (Th1/Th2, Th17/Treg) were generally <2-fold (Supplemantary Table IV). In the ST
however, large temporally-distinct changes in T-helper subtypes occurred (Figure 4B, Table I). Th17
cells predominated at day-7 post-DMM (19%) with levels remaining >10% thereafter, while Tregs
were least common at day-7 (1.4%) increasing to 25% by day-35 then decreasing to <5% by day 84112. Th1 showed the most dramatic post-DMM increase reaching >70% of CD4+ T-cells at day-70
before returning to ~20% at day-112, and while the pattern was broadly similar Th2 changes were
smaller (peaking at ~33% at day-70). Unlike the spleen there was a marked pro-inflammatory

imbalance in ST-CD4+-T-cell subtypes post-DMM: Th1 significantly >Th2 at day-35, -56, -70, and 98; Th17 significantly >Treg at day-1, -70, -84 and -98 (Figure 4B; Supplementary Table IV).

ST-lymphocyte-marker expression
Expression of Cd4 and Cd8 was markedly increased at day-7 in both Sham and DMM (Figure 4C),
decreasing by day 14-35, before increasing again, particularly in DMM, such that by day-112
expression was higher than Sham, reflecting flow-cytometry data (Figure 3). Expression of CD3, CD4
and CD8 mRNA was therefore measured in ST from patients after meniscal injury with no (“NEBH”)
or early (“Rush”) OA, as well as with advanced-OA. CD3 and CD4 were detected in 95-100% of all
patients (no difference between groups), while the percentage of CD8-positive advanced-OA patients
(100%) was greater than meniscal injury (NEBH 77%, Rush 63%). There was no between-group
difference in mean CD3, CD4 or CD8 expression, however CD3 and CD8 were higher with shorter
time post-injury (Figure 4D). Lymphocyte marker expression was significantly correlated with preoperative symptoms: NEBH-patient CD3 and Lysholm score; Rush-patient CD8 and KOOS-pain,
KOOS-ADL, KOOS-Sport/recreation, and KOOS-QoL scores (Figure 4E; Supplemantary Table V).

Treating OA by lymphocyte depletion
Magnetic-activated-cell-sorting selectively depleted CD45+, CD14+ or CD3+ cells from human OA-ST
(Figure 5A). Depleting all hemopoietic-lineage (CD45+) cells or only CD14+ monocytes/macrophages,
markedly decreased MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9 secretion (Figure 5B). Removing only CD3+
lymphocytes had less effect on MMP3 but equivalent decreases in MMP1 and MMP9. In light of this in
vitro data, we evaluated whether lymphocyte depletion would modify DMM-induced ptOA, and
compared targeting the immediate post-injury influx versus that occurring later: pre-DMM versus 3weeks post-DMM anti-CD3. Treatment at either time depleted splenic CD3+ and CD4+ T-cells for 2-

weeks, and CD8+ T-cells for up to 8-weeks (Figure 5C), but there was no significant effect on ST Tcells (Figure 5D). Neither treatment protocol altered subchondral bone remodeling or osteophyte size,
but osteophyte maturation from cartilage to bone was delayed: week-2 and week-8 after pre- and postDMM treatment, respectively (Figure 5E). There was no effect of post-DMM anti-CD3 on cartilage
pathology, however, targeting the initial T-cell response reduced 2-week proteoglycan loss compared
with IgG, slowed progressive 8-16-week proteoglycan loss (Figure 5F) and cartilage structural damage
(Figure 5G), and reduced late-stage (16-week) cartilage damage (Figure 5G).

Discussion
Burgeoning evidence implicates synovial inflammation not just in OA symptoms but structural disease
pathophysiology.[3-8] Failure of non-specific anti-inflammatory approaches (NSAIDs, corticosteroids)
to modify OA pathology, and experience with biologics in rheumatoid arthritis,[35] suggest targeting
of particular inflammatory pathways/effectors will be needed for disease-modification. Moreover, the
disease-specificity of these pathways and knowledge of when in the clinical course they are active is
critical for therapeutic utility. Directly comparing mononuclear inflammatory/immune-cell responses
following significant joint injury that does (DMM-surgery) and does not (Sham-surgery) lead to OA,
allowed us to define bona-fide OA-associated events.
Despite equivalent surgical joint insult and the same acute histologically-graded inflammation,[30]
flow-cytometry revealed a more profound and distinct STMC influx in DMM compared with Sham,
not only with later structural disease but within the first 3 days post-injury, well before OAhistopathologic change. The current paradigm posits that inflammation in joint injury follows a
classical wound-healing pattern: tissue trauma inciting an innate-immune response involving activation
of the complement cascade, with neutrophil and then monocyte/macrophage influx and activation.[5,
11, 23, 36] Non-OA inducing injury would be considered a healing wound where inflammation

resolves as injured tissues repair and remodel, while damage-asscociated-molecular-patterns (DAMPS)
released from degrading joint tissues after OA-inducing injury cause ongoing innate-immune activation
that drives an adaptive immune response, as in chronic/non-healing wounds.[37, 38] However, we
found that with OA-inducing injury (DMM-surgery), ST-monocyte/macrophage influx and polarization
followed the same “successful” wound-healing pattern as Sham-surgery: acute M1-inflammatory
response (peak day 3-7), followed by progressive (4-5 weeks) reparative-M2-polarization, and then
return to age-matched naïve levels. In contrast, there was a rapid (day-1) and chronic cyclical elevation
of ST-lymphocytes that, unlike the innate-immune response, differentiated OA-inducing/DMM from
resolving/Sham injury. This implicates a more important role for the adaptive-immune system in ptOA
risk following joint injury, and that this occurs much earlier than previously suspected.[5, 39]
Rather than a unimodal “insult-inflammation-resolution” model,[38] there were cyclical increases and
decreases in STMCs after joint injury, that were accentuated in DMM and particularly apparent for
lymphocytes. The cyclic pattern could be related to temporal release of DAMPs from different tissues
or different DAMPs released from one progressively damaged tissue.[36, 40] The slight lag between
monocyte/macrophage and lymphocyte peaks (Figure 2 and 3) is consistent with the former secreting
chemokines that attract the latter in a coordinated injury-response.[38] However, despite equivalent
monocyte/macrophage number, activation/polarization and associated Il1 and Il6 expression
(Supplementary Figure 1A) in the immediate post-injury period, there was significantly greater acute
ST-lymphocyte influx in DMM versus Sham. This could be associated with specific DAMP/antigen
release from tissues only injured in DMM (menisco-tibial ligament, destabilized meniscus[41]) and/or
chemokines being secreted from mechanically injured chondrocytes which occurs before histomorphologic pathology.[42]
Analysis of PBMCs and SpMCs indicated a local rather than systemic response to DMM even with
bilateral knee injury, and that OA-associated adaptive-immune response in one joint does not lead to

widespread change, unlike rheumatoid arthritis.[43] Our data contrasts with spontaneous-OA in the
STR/ort mouse, where macrophage and T-cell ST-infiltration is accompanied or preceded-by systemic

absence of such co-morbidities in the non-obese C57BL6 mice in our study may explain the lack of
systemic inflammation, and differences in STMC populations. Elevation in activated-macrophages is
common in ST from late-stage OA-patients,[17, 20, 21] and our cell depletion were consistent with a
pro-catabolic role of ST-macrophages. However, the obesity/metabolic-syndrome common in these
patients can itself cause inflammation with macrophage accumulation.[49-51] Obesity/metabolicsyndrome does worsen surgically-induced ptOA in mice,[51-54] and pre-operative depletion of STmacrophages did reduce synovitis and structural pathology post-DMM in obese C57BL6 mice.[51]
However, in other studies, despite systemic- and ST-macrophage depletion immediately post-DMM,
there was no change in structural disease and actually increased joint inflammation and ST-CD3+ T-cell
influx.[55] Local macrophage depletion in non-obese animals reduces structural joint pathology in
arthritis models with a more profound inflammatory pathophysiology,[56-58] but data in surgicallyinduced ptOA in non-obese mice is lacking. Both DMM- and Sham-surgery in our non-obese mice led
to equivalent ST-monocyte/macrophage infiltration and activation that resolved irrespective of OA
onset or progression. This suggests that ST-macrophage accumulation in OA-patients and STR/ort
mice may be associated more with their meta-inflammatory co-morbidity than the OA per se.[59]
In contrast to macrophages, we showed major differences between DMM and Sham in STlymphocytes. Our data in advanced ptOA (day-112) are in accordance with that from end-stage OApatients showing the presence and activated phenotype of ST-CD4+T-cells.[19-22] We now report that
increased ST-lymphocytes, particularly CD4+, occurs almost immediately following OA-inducing joint

injury, consistent with the limited available data in patients with early versus late OA.[9] The number
of ST-CD8+ T-cells was also increased in DMM compared with NOC and Sham up to 8 weeks postsurgery but there was less difference immediately post-surgery or in late-stage OA. There is some
suggestion in patients that ST-CD8+T-cells increase with knee OA severity, [60] and we found more
patients with late OA had detectable CD8 mRNA in their ST. There may be confounding effects as
both age and obesity/metabolic-syndrome increase CD8+T-cell number and activation in blood and
peripheral tissues,[61-63] and lack of systemic lymphocyte change or increase in late-stage ST-CD8+Tcells in our study may be associated with use of young non-obese mice.
Previous studies have demonstrated a preponderance of Th1-activated ST-CD4+T-cells in late-stage
human OA, with lower percentages of Treg, Th2, and Th17.[22] Our data shows that ST-Th1/Th2
imbalance occurs particularly during early and progressive OA, and then diminishes before becoming
apparent again in late-stage disease. In contrast, ST-Th17/Treg imbalance predominated acutely postinjury, was lost in early disease, and then re-emerged later due to a decrease in Tregs. Increased STTh17 has been reported in OA patients,[64] but rather than being decreased, Tregs were found in higher
numbers in ST than blood and with more advanced radiographic disease.[22, 65, 66] Again differences
in Th17/Treg balance in late-stage OA in DMM versus patients is likely associated with confounding
effects of obesity and ageing in the latter.[63]
Lymphocyte cell-surface-marker mRNA expression can provide a surrogate for flow-cytometric cell
counting.[10] That expression of classic monocyte/macrophage cytokines Il1 and Il6 in ST was not
higher in DMM than Sham and returned to naïve levels by 5-weeks post-surgery (Supplementary
Figure 1A), was consistent with the lack of OA-specific innate immune-cell response (Figure 2). ST
mRNA expression of Cd4, Cd8, and the Th1-cytokine Tnf (Supplementary Figure 1B) showed cyclic
changes post-surgery and were increased in DMM similar to flow-cytometry, supporting use of STmRNA for analysis of archival human ST samples. While mean mRNA levels of lymphocyte markers

were not different between patient cohorts as in previous analysis,[10] the temporal pattern in the
meniscal injury groups was consistent with the mouse data, showing an early CD3+CD8+ response. Of
interest was the positive association between ST CD8 but not CD4 expression with pain/symptoms in
meniscal injury patients. Generalised synovitis is associated with worse symptoms in patients with
established OA,[8] and meniscal injury.[26, 27] In late-stage OA-patients, the percentage of STCD4+T-cells, but not CD8+T-cells or macrophages, has been associated with pain even after adjusting
for BMI.[20] While CD4+T-cells have been strongly implicated in chronic neuropathic pain
pathophysiology, the role of CD8+T-cells is less clear with both pro- and anti-algesic effects
reported.[67, 68] Our association data in patients suggests a novel role for synovial CD8+T-cells in the
early clinical symptoms following meniscal injury, but pre- or post-DMM anti-CD3 failed to modify
pain-sensitization in mice (Supplementary Figure 2). This could be associated with sex differences as
T-cells may play a more important role in chronic pain hypersensitivity in females,[69] or because
systemic anti-CD3 failed to modify lymphocyte numbers in the ST where they may play a more direct
pro-algesic role. Finally, our broad anti-CD3 depletion strategy may have affected both pro- and antialgesic T-cells, and a more targeted approach may be needed.
Synovitis increases the risk of incident structural OA in population-based studies,[12, 13] and
progression of cartilage damage in patients with meniscal injuries.[70] Our patient ST-cell depletion
studies demonstrate that CD3+lymphocytes play a role in upregulation of patho-physiologically
relevant MMPs, consistent with previous reports.[10] Whether this is through inhibiting synthesis of
metalloproteinases by lymphocytes or modulatuion of their co-stimulation of macrophage MMP
synthesis is unclear.[71, 72] CD4+T-cell and macrophage activation in OA synovial fluid are positively
associated,[17] and compared with PBMCs T-cells in late-OA ST show increased activation and
secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.[20, 22, 64, 73, 74] This suggests that factors in

the local joint environment drive T-cell cytokine secretion, which in turn may modulate the effects of
activated CD4+T-cells in increasing chondrocyte MMP expression.[74]
Decreased lymphatic drainage occurs in surgically induced ptOA onset in mice, with synovitis,
osteophytes and cartilage damage worsened by inhibition of lymph-angiogenesis and ameliorated with
improvement in lymphatic function.[75]. More direct evidence for T-cells in OA pathophysiology
comes from mice deficient in CD4[76] or CD8[77] which both have reduced ptOA cartilage damage,
and despite constitutive depletion only protection in late-stage ptOA was seen. This is in line with our
anti-CD3 data, but by using a transient depletion strategy we show that while the immediate and 4week post-DMM T-cell response contribute to osteophyte development, the earliest T-cell response is
key to late stage ptOA cartilage damage. This is consistent with the presence and severity of the initial
synovitis following meniscal injury even if it subsequently resolves, being associated with risk of
progressive cartilage damage in patients.[70] While there was no change in PBMC or SpMC T-cell
number or activation in DMM-induced ptOA, the anti-CD3 treatment outcomes implicate systemic Tcells in progressive cartilage damage. That systemic T-cell depletion was not mirrored in the ST raises
the question of where the ST-cells originate. As well as influx and polarization of circulating cells,
activation and proliferation of resident populations could contribute to both the innate- and adaptiveimmune response. The majority of CD45+ cells in normal ST are CD11b+ monocyte-lineage, and our
current and previous data[10, 51] indicate that ~20% of these are macrophages that could participate
immediately post-injury. The predominant resident-monocyte population could then be activated by
mechanical, cellular or soluble stimuli.[11, 33, 36, 37, 59] As the number of resident T-cells in normal
ST is very low, the immediate post-injury increase more likely arises through influx rather than local
replication. Analysis of late-stage OA patients indicates CD8+ clonality but whether this occurs through
selective migration/influx or local clonal selection/expansion is unclear.[64]

In conclusion our comprehensive temporal quantitative comparison of ST inflammatory cell influx
after OA-inducing versus non-OA-inducing joint injury, has enabled us to define the important role of
the adaptive immune response. Increases in number and activation of ST-T-cells in joints at risk of OA
occurred within the first 3 days of injury, and while recurring cyclically through subsequent disease
onset, depletion studies indicated this initial influx was key to long-term ptOA risk. There are a number
of differences between our pre-clinical animal and patient populations, that highlight key research
questions for further study. Thus, the precise local environmental cues in the OA joint that stimulate
and maintain the adaptive-immune response, the specific T-cell subsets involved in symptomatic and
structural disease, and modification by systemic factors such as age, sex, and obesity/metabolicsyndrome remain to be defined. Nevertheless, the present results identify a hitherto unappreciated
pathophysiological role of acute T-cell activation after joint injury in ptOA risk, opening new
diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic avenues.

Figure 1: Progressive osteoarthritis structural pathology occurs after destabilization of the
medial meniscus (DMM) but not Sham surgery. (A) Representative images of toluidine blue/fastgreen stained sections of medial femorotibial joints of mice 7-112 days after Sham or DMM surgery
compared with age-matched non-operated controls (NOC; scalebar = 200µ)). Progressive loss of
cartilage proteoglycan staining followed by non-calcified cartilage erosion only occurs in DMM and is
accompanied by increased subchondral bone sclerosis and loss of epiphyseal marrow. Two observers
blinded to injury and time scored the tibial (B) cartilage proteoglycan loss, (C) cartilage structural
damage, (D) subchondral bone sclerosis, and (E) osteophyte size. Data is shown as the mean ± SEM;
NOC = triangle and solid line, Sham = circle and dotted line, DMM = square and dashed line.
Statistical comparison was performed for those time points where scores for all three groups were
available (highlighted with a vertical dashed line); n = 10 for DMM and Sham, and n = 4 for NOC;

Figure 2: DMM results in greater cyclical synovial mononuclear cell influx than Sham surgery
but no difference in monocyte/macrophage activation or polarization. (A) Both Sham and DMM
surgery resulted in cyclical increases in mononuclear cell number in the synovial tissue compared with
non-operated controls (NOC), however the effect was more pronounced and persistent with DMM.
There was no difference in synovial cell number in NOC over time so a mean value (solid line ± SEM
represented by grey shading) was calculated and used for comparison with Sham (circle with dotted
line) and DMM (square with dashed line) at each time point indicated with a vertical line (n = 4 [each a
pool of 4 mice]/time/surgery; *=P≤0.05; +=P≤0.01; #=P≤0.001). (B) Isolated synovial cells were gated
for flow cytometric analysis using the forward scatter profile and 7-AAD staining to exclude debris and
dead cells. Monocyte/macrophage cell populations were then defined by cell surface markers (cut offs

resident monocytes (CD11b+F4/80-Ly6c+), (ii) inflammatory monocytes (CD11b+F4/80+Ly6chigh), (iii)
activated macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+Ly6clow), which were further distinguished by their relative
expression of Ly6g (right panel; colours according to gate i, ii, or iii). The frequency of synovial
CD11b+ cells (C), resident monocytes (D), inflammatory monocytes (E), and activated macrophages
(F), showed distinct temporal changes after surgery compared with NOC but with no significant
difference between Sham and DMM (n and analyses as described for panel A). (G) Activated
macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+Ly6clow) in Sham and DMM showed a very similar temporal pattern of
polarization from M0 (CD11c-/CD206-) to M1 (CD11c+/CD206-), M1/2 (CD11c+/CD206+) and finally
M2 (CD11c-/CD206+).

Figure 3: DMM results in significantly greater cyclical synovial T-cell cell influx than Sham
surgery. (A) Viable mononuclear cells were gated based on the negative 7-AAD staining and further
through the CD45 marker. CD3 and CD11b were used as broad markers for lymphocytes and
monocytes/macrophages cells, respectively. These two distinct cell populations showed no overlap and
were all CD45+, with little or no CD3 or CD11b staining in the CD45- population. The right column
shows the cell size and granularity of CD3+ (red) and CD11b+ (blue) cells. Cells in the “lymphocyte
gate” based on forward and side scatter were further defined as CD3+CD4+CD8- T-helper cells and
CD3+CD4-CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (B). The frequency (C, E, G) and absolute number (D, F, H) of
synovial CD3+ lymphocytes (C, D), CD4+ T-helper (E, F) and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (G, H), showed
distinct temporal changes after surgery compared with NOC, with significantly greater numbers at
multiple timepoints in DMM compared with Sham. There was no difference in synovial lymphocytes
in NOC over time so a mean value (solid line ± SEM represented by grey shading) was calculated and
used for comparison with Sham (circle with dotted line) and DMM (square with dashed line) at each

Figure 4: T-cell changes in post-traumatic osteoarthritis (ptOA) are localised to the joint, show
temporally distinct Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg imbalance, and are associated with worse clinical
symptoms in patients. (A) CD45+CD3+CD4+CD8- T-cells subsets were defined by production of their
specific cytokines and transcription factors: Th1-IFNγ+, Th2-IL-4+, Th17- IL-17a+, and Treg-FoxP3+.
(B) DMM surgery resulted in little temporal change in these CD4+ T-cell subsets in the spleen but proinflammatory imbalances in Th17/Treg acutely after injury and in late disease, while a Th1/Th2
imbalance predominated during the progression of ptOA structural damage. Data is shown as the mean
± SEM (n = 4 replicates [each a pool of 6 mice]/time/surgery) with differences between Th17:Treg and
Th1:Th2 analysed as each time (*=P≤0.05; +=P≤0.01; #=P≤0.001). (C) Analysis of synovial Cd4 and
Cd8 mRNA expression in mice showed a cyclic pattern (similar to that seen with flow cytometry) with
more persistent elevation in DMM than Sham. Data shows mean ± SEM for NOC (triangle with solid
line), Sham (circle with dotted line), and DMM (square with dashed line), with comparisons between
groups at each time point indicated with a vertical line (n = 6 individual mice/time/surgery; *=P≤0.05;
+=P≤0.01; #=P≤0.001). (D) Expression of CD3 and CD8 (but not CD4) in synovial tissue collected at
the time of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in patients without or with early OA (NEBH and Rush
cohorts, respectively), showed higher levels with a shorter time after injury. (E) Higher CD3 (NEBH
patients) and CD8 (Rush patients) were significantly correlated with worse pre-operative symptoms
(lower Lysholm or KOOS scores).

administered either 1 week Pre- or 3 weeks Post-DMM significantly depleted splenic CD3+ and CD4+
T-cells for 2-weeks post-treatment, and CD8+-T-cells for 8- (Pre-DMM treatment) or 5-weeks (PostDMM treatment) compared with control antibody. With pre-DMM treatment the CD4+ T-cells
rebounded and were increased compared with control antibody at week-16. Data shows all individual
replicates as well as mean ± SEM (n = 4-12 individual mouse spleens/time/treatment; *=P≤0.05;

CD8+ T-cells in the synovial tissues following systemic anti-CD3 administered either 1 week Pre- or 3
weeks Post-DMM (n = 2-5 replicates [each a pool of 4 mice]/time/treatment).

(E) Osteophyte

maturation was reduced at 2- and 8-weeks post-DMM by anti-CD3 administered 1 week Pre- or 3
weeks Post-DMM, respectively. (F) While cartilage proteoglycan loss was unaffected by anti-CD3
given Post-DMM, it was reduced at 2-weeks when administered Pre-DMM which also slowed
progressive loss from 8-16 weeks. (G) There was no effect of post-DMM anti-CD3 on tibial cartilage
structural pathology, however pre-surgical treatment significantly slowed late stage cartilage structural
damage progression from 8-16 weeks, and reduced severity of 16-week cartilage damage compared
with IgG control. Histology data (panels E-G) shows all individual mice as well as mean ± SEM (n =

Supplementary Information.
Cohorts for human ST mRNA analysis
All studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of Rush University Medical Center
or the New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH), and all patients gave written, informed consent.
Advanced knee OA: 16 synovial tissue specimens were obtained from patients with advanced OA
undergoing total knee replacement, who had provided tissue specimens to the IRB-approved (Protocol
Nr. L00011021) Orthopedic Tissue and Implant Repository at Rush University Medical Center
(Chicago, IL). All specimens came from patients meeting ACR criteria for knee OA confirmed by the
operating surgeon and had radiographic evidence of moderate to severe knee OA on pre-operative knee
x-rays (Kellgren-Lawrence score >2). Age, sex, and BMI were available from these patients in addition
to radiographic score.
Meniscal injury with early OA (Rush): 19 synovial specimens from patients with early-stage knee OA
undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were obtained from the IRB-approved Knee Injury and
Arthritis repository (Protocol Nr. 10011306), also located at Rush University Medical Center (Chicago,
IL). The diagnosis of early-stage OA was determined by the operating surgeon, and confirmed by
presence of a degenerative meniscal tear and either intraoperative evidence of cartilage degeneration in
the medial, lateral or patellofemoral compartments (Outerbridge score ≥1), OR presence of
radiographic OA changes (Kellgren-Lawrence stage ≥1) on pre-operative x-rays. Age, gender, BMI,
and location of meniscal tear were available for these patients, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis
Outcome Score (KOOS), English version LK1.0 was used to measure preoperative knee symptoms.
Questionnaires, scoring manual and user’s guide were obtained from http://www.koos.nu. The KOOS
measures symptoms and disability on five separately scored sub scales: Pain, other Symptoms,
Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Sports and Recreation and Quality of Life (QOL).
Meniscal injury with no OA (NEBH): 13 synovial tissue specimens were obtained from patients who
had participated in a longitudinal study at the New England Baptist Hospital (Boston, MA). These
patients had a history of acute knee injury within the previous 1 year, had an MRI-confirmed meniscal
tear and had undergone arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. Patients with any radiographic evidence of
OA (Kellgren-Lawrence score >0) were excluded from this study. Age, sex, BMI, location of meniscal
tear and pre-operative Lysholm scores were available for these patients. The Lysholm questionnaire is
a clinician-developed instrument, measuring symptoms including pain, swelling, limp, locking, and
instability, as well as functional disability (stair-climbing, squatting, use of supports). A summed score
is reported on a scale of 0-100, where 100 = no symptoms/disability.

Supplementary Figure 1: Changes in synovial cytokine expression following sham or DMM
surgery, and effects of T-cell depletion on pain. (A) Expression of Il1 and Il6 mRNA in mouse
synovial tissue was markedly increased 7-days post-DMM and then declined toward NOC levels by
day 35-49. While expression of both cytokines was similar in Sham and DMM at day-7, it remained
elevated in Sham at day-14 (>DMM) before declining. (B) While Tnf expression also increased at day
7 and declined at day 14 in Sham and DMM, it showed a second peak elevation at day-49 and remained
higher than NOC in both operated joints (DMM > Sham) for the remainder of the study. (C) Peripheral
tactile allodynia measured as significant reduction in 50% withdrawal reflex using with Von Frey
fibres, was evident 2 weeks post-DMM and remained present through the course of the study. There
was no difference in allodynia at any time between mice treated Pre- or Post-DMM with IgG versus
anti-CD3. Data is shown as the mean ± SEM; NOC = triangle and solid line, Sham = circle and dotted
line, DMM = square and dashed line. Statistical comparison was performed for those time points where
scores for all groups were available (highlighted with a vertical dashed line); n = 5-6 individual mouse
synovial tissues/time/treatment, and repeated measure in n = 8 mice/treatment for allodynia; *=P≤0.05;
+=P≤0.01; #=P≤0.001.
