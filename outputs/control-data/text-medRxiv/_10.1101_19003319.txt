Abstract
Aims: To evaluate the effect of toric intraocular lens implantation in cataract patient with corneal
opacity and high astigmatism.

Methods: 31 eyes of 31 patients who underwent cataract surgery with toric intraocular lens
implantation were included. All patients had corneal opacity with regular astigmatism. Preoperative
total corneal astigmatism was determined considering posterior astigmatism using a rotating
Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam®: Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany). At 2 months after toric intraocular lens
implantation, we evaluated residual astigmatism, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected
visual acuity (BCVA).

Results: Postoperative UCVA and BCVA (0.30 ± 0.17, 0.22 ± 0.16LogMAR) statistically improved
compared to preoperative UCVA and BCVA (1.2 ± 0.34, 1.1 ± 0.30LogMAR, respectively) (P<0.01).
Postoperative residual refractive astigmatism (1.2 ± 0.35D) was statistically reduced compared to
preoperative refractive astigmatism (2.4 ± 0.65D) (P<0.05). Preoperative and postoperative total
corneal astigmatism values were not statistically different. All cases achieved visual acuity were as
good as or better than that preoperatively. The percentage of corneal opacity covering pupillary area
had significant negative correlation with postoperative UCVA and BCVA (logMAR) (R=-0.88 P<0.00001
and R=-0.87 P<0.00001, respectively)

Conclusion: Toric intraocular lens implantation can improve UCVA, BCVA, and refractive astigmatism
in cataract patient with corneal opacity. The percentage of central corneal opacity covering pupillary
area is the major prognostic factor for postoperative visual improvement. Therefore, toric intraocular
lens implantation should be considered for cataract patients who have corneal opacity with high
astigmatism.

Introduction
Corneal opacity and cataract are the primary causes of decreasing visual acuity. There are two
currently surgical treatments options for patients with corneal opacity and cataract. The Triple
procedure, simultaneous penetrating keratoplasty (PK), cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL)
implantation provides a shorter visual rehabilitation period. However, the disadvantages include risk
1

of expulsive hemorrhage, inadequate cortical cleaning and inaccuracy in IOL power calculation can
decrease postoperative visual acuity. Cataract surgery without PK is sometimes associated with good
2

visual acuity when the corneal opacity partially obscures the pupillary area. Even though visual
3

outcomes after cataract surgery in eyes with corneal opacities can vary, corneal opacity severity may
be one of the major prognostic factors of visual acuity. When there is opacity in the patient’s cornea,
4

astigmatism usually occurs in the vertical axis (with-the-rule astigmatism), horizontal axis (againstthe-rule astigmatism), oblique axis, or irregular axis. When the patient’s cornea has regular
astigmatism, good visual acuity can be achieved through astigmatic correction. During cataract
surgery, astigmatism can be corrected by prescription glasses, contact lenses, corneal relaxing
incisions, astigmatic keratotomy, limbal relaxing incisions, excimer laser ablation, or toric IOL
implantation. Toric IOL implantation is the most reliable and effective method for correcting regular
5

astigmatism during cataract surgery. We hypothesized that toric IOL implantation can improve visual
acuity in patients with cataract and regular corneal astigmatism.
To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no studies that have evaluated the efficacy of toric
IOL implantation in cataract patients with corneal opacity.

Materials and methods

This study was conducted by performing a retrospective chart review and data analysis. This study
was conducted in compliance with Institutional Review Board regulations, informed consent
regulations, sponsor and investigator obligations, and the Declaration of Helsinki. The Institutional
Review Board (IRB) / Ethics Committee of Bucheon St. Mary’s Hospital approved this study protocol.

Patients
Thirty-one patients that had cataract and corneal opacity with regular astigmatism were enrolled from
Bucheon St. Mary’s Hospital from June 2017 to April 2018.
Inclusion criteria were corneal opacification that involved the visual axis and advanced cataract in
patients with regular corneal astigmatism and eyes with partially visible anterior capsules and
pupillary margins. Patients with a history of any ocular injury or disorder, infection, inflammation,
surgery within the prior 6 months and an eye with irregular astigmatism were excluded.

Preoperative evaluation
All patients underwent a complete preoperative ophthalmological examination. The demographic and
perioperative data were recorded. Uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity were expressed
as logMAR. Manifest refraction, biometry and keratometry with the IOLMaster partial coherence
interferometry device (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG), corneal topography to exclude irregular astigmatism,
slit lamp examination, and dilated funduscopy were performed. The IOL manufacturer's web-based
toric calculator was used to determine the required cylinder power and axis for implantation. The
total corneal astigmatism was measured using the Scheimpflug system (Pentacam , Oculus,
®

Germany). The percentage of corneal opacity covering pupillary area was calculated using image J
(National Institutes of Health, Maryland).

Operative Procedures
Before surgery, the corneal limbus was marked at the 0∘, 90∘, and 180∘ meridians with the patient in a
sitting position after instilling topical anesthetic eye drops. All operations were performed under
topical anesthesia by a single skilled surgeon (E.C.K) using the Intrepid Infiniti system (Alcon
Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA). The corneal steep axis and 6.0 mm ring were marked with
gentian violet. Surgery was performed through a clear corneal incision at the steep astigmatic axis.
After topical ocular anesthesia was applied, a 2.75 mm clear corneal incision was made using a 2.75
mm double-blade keratome (Alcon). Sodium hyaluronate 1.0% (Hyal Plus, LG Life Science, Seoul,
Korea) was used to reform and stabilize the anterior chamber. A continuous curvilinear capsulotomy
was made with a 6.0 mm corneal marker using Inamura capsulorhexis forceps (Duckworth & Kent
Ltd., Baldock, UK). Hydrodissection and hydrodelineation were achieved using a balanced salt solution.
Phacoemulsification was performed using 2.75-mm-sized phaco-tips and infusion/aspiration (I/A)
cannulas in the micro- and small-incision groups, respectively. A clear preloaded IOL (Tecnis ZCT;
Abbott Medical Optics) was implanted in the capsular bag. The wound was not sutured (Video).
Postoperative treatment consisted of gatifloxacin 0.3% (Gatiflo, Handok, Chungbuk, Korea) and
fluorometholone acetate 0.01% (Ocumetholone, Samil, Seoul, Korea) eye drops four times a day for
four weeks.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using a commercial program (SPSS for Windows; version 21.0.1;
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare pre- and postoperative
BCVA and refractive and keratometry astigmatism. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

0.34) and BCVA (1.10 ± 0.30) (P<0.05) (Figure 1). The UCVA 2 months postoperatively was 20/32 or
better in 19 eyes (61.3%) and 20/25 or better in 7 eyes (22.6%) (Figure 2). The postoperative
residual refractive astigmatism (1.20 ± 0.35 D) was statistically reduced compared to preoperative
refractive astigmatism (2.4 ± 0.65 D) (P<0.05). Preoperative and postoperative total corneal
astigmatism (1.91 ± 0.44 & 1.52 ± 0.38 D, respectively) were not statistically different (Figure 3).
The percentage of residual astigmatism within ± 0.5D was 22.6% (7 eyes of 31), and that within ±
1.0D was 58.1% (27 eyes of 31) (Figure 4).
100% cases achieved UCVA and BCVA were as good as or better than that preoperatively with

(Figure 7A). His preoperative BCVA was 20/200 and refractive astigmatism was 2.5D. After a Tecnis
ZCT225 was inserted, postoperative 2 month UCVA was 20/22, BCVA was 20/20, and residual
refractive astigmatism was 1.0D. Figure 8 involves a 63-year-old female patient who reported central
corneal opacity in her right eye from birth. Her preoperative BCVA was 20/60 and refractive
astigmatism was 2.75D. After a Tecnis ZCT300 was inserted, her postoperative 2 month UCVA was
20/24, BCVA was 20/22, and residual refractive astigmatism was 0D.

Discussion
About 60% of patients with normal corneas that undergo cataract surgery have more than 0.75D of
corneal astigmatism. Therefore, patients with cataract and corneal opacity have greater corneal
6

astigmatism than the normal population. Consequently, simultaneous penetrating keratoplasty and
7

cataract surgery may be the preferred treatment option in this patient group.

2

8

However,

simultaneous penetrating keratoplasty and cataract surgery may induce more astigmatism than the
preoperative condition.

2 8

Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation in selected cases of coexisting

cataract and corneal opacity are safe and can provide suboptimal but long-term vision when
penetrating keratoplasty is not an option or there is a high risk of graft failure. Cataract surgery with
4

toric IOL implantation could better improve visual acuity than simultaneous penetrating keratoplasty
and cataract surgery when the central cornea is not totally opaque. BCVA improvements after
3

surgery are less likely for more severe opacity indices that involve the pupil, according to the
reflectivity signal.

4

In this study, postoperative UCVA (0.30 ± 0.17) and BCVA (0.22 ± 0.16) were significantly improved
compared to preoperative UCVA (1.20 ± 0.34) and BCVA (1.10 ± 0.30) (P<0.05). Ho et al. reported
preoperative mean UCVA and BCVA of 20/800 and 20/630, respectively, which significantly improved
to 20/200 and 20/160 (P < 0.001) after cataract surgery with monofocal IOL implantation in patients
with corneal opacity. In the Ho et al. study, visual acuity improvement was less than that in our study,
4

because astigmatism was not corrected in this study.
Müftüoğlu İK reported that mean preoperative BCVA significantly increased (0.7 ± 0.3 [range: 0.3–1.3]
logMAR to 0.1 ± 0.04 [range: 0.05–0.15] logMAR; P<0.05) at a mean of 8.71 ± 64.11 months after
cataract surgery with toric IOL implantation in patients with cataract formation and high astigmatism
after penetrating keratoplasty. Development of cataract is highly possible after PK because of chronic
9

high-dose steroid use and surgical intervention. Toric IOLs are reported to be an effective modality to
correct astigmatism in patients with cataract.

10-12

Additionally, visual acuity improvement was greater

in the study by Müftüoğlu İK than in our study, because the corneas in their study were relatively
clear after PK compared to those in our study..

In this study, the 2 month postoperative UCVA was 20/32 or better in 19 eyes (61.3%) and 20/25 or
better in 7 eyes (22.6%). This indicates that the majority of patients who underwent toric IOL
implantation will not need to wear glasses daily. The corrected distance Snellen visual acuity (with
spectacles or contact lenses) 12 months postoperatively was 20/32 or better in 82% of eyes in
keratoconus patients with toric IOL implantation. In the normal cataract patients that did not have
13

corneal opacity, mean LogMAR UDVA and BDVA were 0.19 ± 0.12 and 0.14 ± 0.10, respectively. In
addition, a postoperative UDVA of 20/40 or better was achieved in 92.6% of eyes.

14

In this study, postoperative residual refractive astigmatism (1.20 ± 0.35 D) was statistically reduced
compared to preoperative refractive astigmatism (2.4 ± 0.65 D) (P<0.05). Müftüoğlu İK reported that
the mean preoperative corneal keratometric astigmatism was 5.4 ± 0.9 D (range: 4.25–7.00 D) at the
corneal plane and 6.3 ± 1.0 D (range: 4.9–8.1 D) at the spectacle plane, and the average manifest
refractive astigmatism was 1.5 ± 0.7 D (range: 0.25–2.25 D) at postoperative month 1 after toric IOL
implantation in patients that had previously undergone penetrating keratoplasty. Postoperative
9

refractive astigmatism significantly decreased in their study, which was in agreement with the results
of our study. In contrast, refractive astigmatism persisted after cataract surgery with monofocal IOL
implantation. In normal cataract patients without corneal opacity, mean refractive cylinder decreased
4

significantly from −3.73 ± 1.96 to −1.42 ± 0.88D (‫ < ݌‬0.001), while keratometric cylinder did not
change significantly (‫ = ݌‬0.44) after toric IOL implantation. The visual and refractive astigmatic
14

outcomes were comparable to reports on normal cataract patients without corneal opacity, even
though there was corneal opacity in this study.
In other study, 92.3% cases achieved visual acuity were as good as or better than that preoperatively
with correction after monofocal IOL implantation. However, in this study, all cases achieved visual
4

acuity were as good as or better than that preoperatively with correction after toric IOL implantation.
In central corneal opacity, phacoemulsification should be performed when the extent of opacity is
small enough to improve visual acuity after surgery. In this study, we included patients with
15

peripheral corneal opacity as demonstrated in Figure 7, and large central corneal opacity as in Figure
8. Patient with peripheral corneal opacity had more improved postoperative UCVA and BCVA

compared to patient with central corneal opacity, in these cases. Regarding visual outcome, Ho Y. et
al. reported that there is no significant correlation between logMAR BCVA and corneal densitometry
and OCT grading (P >0.05). However, in this study, the percentage of corneal opacity covering
4

pupillary area was negatively correlated with postoperative UCVA and BCVA improvement (P<0.05)
(Figure 6).
Therefore, we concluded that not the central corneal opacity size, but the percentage of central
corneal opacity covering pupillary area was the major prognostic factor for postoperative visual
improvement. Patients with paracentral corneal opacity are the best candidates for cataract surgery to
optimize vision. But, if corneal opacity did not cover the whole central pupillary area, good vision
15

can be achieved with cataract surgery and toric IOL implantation.

This was the first study to evaluate toric IOL implantation outcomes in cataract patients with corneal
opacity. The postoperative visual acuity was significantly improved in spite of the previously existing
corneal opacity. The postoperative residual refractive astigmatism was also significantly improved.
Postoperative UCVA and BCVA were correlated with the percentage of corneal opacity covering
pupillary area. Therefore, toric IOL implantation is effective for improving visual acuity in patients with
corneal opacity and cataract.

Study Limitations
The short duration of follow up (2 month) and lack of control over the monofocal IOL of the subjects
were among the limitations of this study. A multicenter clinical trial with a larger sample size and
longer follow up period is suggested to observe the long-term efficacy of the toric intraocular lens
implantation in cataract patients with corneal opacity.
