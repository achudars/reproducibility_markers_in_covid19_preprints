ABSTRACT
Background: The evaluation of trends in patient outcomes requires adjustment for the changes
in case-mix over time and, thus, could be influenced by the expansion of code slots on inpatient
claims that occurred in January 2011. We tested the hypothesis that the changes in code slots
caused an artifactual increase in the case mix over time compared with a strategy that restricted
inpatient codes to the same number of slots over time, excluding consideration of codes beyond
the first 9 after the expansion.
Methods: In Medicare claims over a 5-year period spanning the inpatient code slot expansion
(2008-2012), we created cohorts of hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) and pneumonia, common hospitalization conditions included in federal policies.
We obtained information on risk factors for 30-day post-discharge mortality or readmission for
each condition from inpatient facility Medicare claims, outpatient facility claims and professional
(or carrier) claims. We evaluated the effects of additional codes captured from the expanded
slots in inpatient claims on the number of risk factors or model covariates, overall and based on
their contribution to the risk of mortality or readmission. We modelled the effects of code
expansion on risk-assessment using an interrupted time series framework.
Results: There were 2,102,509 eligible hospitalizations for HF, 872,734 for AMI and 1,824,079
for pneumonia. The average number of risk factors increased across all covariate selection
strategies. There was a larger increase in monthly average covariate count that included all
codes at the time of the code slot increase relative to a strategy that consistently used only 9
inpatient codes (level change in interrupted time series model, 0.9% [95% CI 0.7% to 1.1%] in
HF, 0.6% [0.5% to 0.7%] for AMI and 0.6% [0.4% to 0.8%] for pneumonia). Using both inpatient
and outpatient/carrier codes for assessing risk factors, there was a smaller difference between
strategies using 9 inpatient codes, compared with all inpatient claims (relative excess increase
in covariates by 0.6% [0.4% to 0.8%] in HF, 0.4% [0.3% to 0.5%] for AMI, and 0.3% [0.1% to

0.6%] in pneumonia). However, the additional codes were limited to covariates with small
contributions to the risk-adjustment models for mortality, without a significant inflection in
measured risk of mortality across code expansion (P>0.05 in interrupted time-series models).
Measured readmission risk increased with using only inpatient claims for risk assessment, but
not if all outpatient and carrier claims were also used (P>0.05 in interrupted time-series models).
Conclusions: The expansion of inpatient code slots did not meaningfully affect the
measurement of the risk of mortality or readmission, especially if comprehensive inpatient and
outpatient claims are used, because the additional covariates only included conditions with a
modest influence on risk adjusted models. The use of all versus limited codes after the code slot
expansion has a minimal effect on evaluating trends in these conditions.

BACKGROUND
The evaluation of trends in patient outcomes requires adjustment for the changes in case mix
over time. Changes in Medicare coding rules, with the expansion of code slots on inpatient
claims that occurred in January 2011, could influence risk adjustment independent of any
changes in the patient population and lead to false inferences about the effect of time. This
issue can be particularly important when evaluating the effect of policy changes around the time
of the code slot expansion, such as occurred with the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program
(HRRP). 1-3
Studies that have evaluated the effect of different methodological approaches to these
changes have been limited. 2,3 They have focused on claims derived from limited sources, such
as inpatient claims,1 or inpatient and limited outpatient claims,2 as opposed to the use of more
comprehensive claims data, as is used in the CMS measures, which may blunt the impact of the
change. Also, at least one study only evaluated changes in frequency of a few select
comorbidities rather than the effect on risk or risk-adjusted trends.1 There is a need to determine
how different methodological approaches to managing the changes in the coding rules affects
characterization of risk of readmission and mortality.
Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that the changes in code slots caused an
artifactual increase in the case mix over time compared with a strategy that restricted inpatient
codes to the same number of slots over time, excluding consideration of coders beyond the first
9 after the expansion. We used the entire complement of Medicare claims from inpatient and
outpatient care settings, and focused on the 3 conditions that are frequently targeted in Federal
policies to define study cohorts. These 3 conditions - heart failure, acute myocardial infarction
(AMI), and pneumonia – have also been a part of the HRRP since its inception. Although we
focus on conditions included in the HRRP, this issue also has importance for any assessments
of change in practices and outcomes conducted over this period.

METHODS
Overview
We tested different strategies for the number of inpatient codes use and the data sources used
on the change, at the time of the coding increase, on the frequency of comorbidities and on the
risk of readmission or mortality.
Data Sources
We used the 100% Medicare Standard Analytic Files for the years 2008 through 2012 that
included all claims submitted for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from inpatient,
outpatient, and physician professional claims.3 Inpatient claims represent Medicare claims
submitted by hospitals for inpatient hospitalizations, including both diagnoses and procedures
that were part of the treatment during the hospitalization.4 Research studies frequently use the
inpatient complement of claims.5 Outpatient claims represent facility claims that correspond to
clinic visits, observation stays, emergency department visits, and outpatient rehabilitation center
visits.6 Certain studies leverage these outpatient claims as well.2,7 The physician provider or
carrier claims, which numerically represent the largest set of claims, are submitted by
physicians and other clinical providers for professional clinical services during either inpatient or
outpatient visits, including services where facility charges are not submitted.8 The availability of
these data is limited.8 The measures for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
use all these sources of data to define comorbidities that are used in risk-adjustment models. In
the current study, the term “inpatient claims” refers to institutional claims for hospitalizations,
and “outpatient claims” refer to all outpatient facility claims and professional claims across all
settings.

We included all hospitalizations for patients discharge alive after an inpatient hospital admission
with one of the 3 conditions that have always been included in the Hospital Readmissions
Reduction Program – heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia. Index
hospitalizations for these conditions were defined by a principle admission diagnosis for the
respective conditions on inpatient claims. The definitions for these hospitalizations are
consistent with those used in the CMS measures to the define these conditions,9,10 and with
studies that have used Medicare data to evaluate the HRRP (eFigures 1-3).11-13
Covariate selection strategies
Covariates for risk adjustment were those used in the CMS 30-day readmission and mortality
based on claims submitted in the 12-month period preceding the index hospitalization event. We
identified 4 covariate selection strategies based on whether studies used only inpatient claims
or both inpatient and comprehensive outpatient claims to identify comorbid health conditions,
and how they processed inpatient claims after code slots increased in 2011. These strategies
identified covariates using (1) only inpatient claims, using 9 secondary diagnosis codes and 6
procedure codes even when more codes were available, (2) only inpatient claims, using all
available codes after the expansion of codes, (3) a fixed number of inpatient claims (as in 1,
above), but supplemented with comprehensive outpatient claims, and (4) all inpatient claims
(as in 2, above) after the code expansion, along with comprehensive outpatient claims.
Statistical analyses
First, we examined trends in the number of covariates for each month in the 5-year period
spanning the transition based on each of the 4 covariate selection strategies. Next, to identify
the relative contribution of each covariate in the adjustment models for readmission and
mortality, using data in the year 2008, for each of the 3 HRRP conditions, we constructed
logistic regression models with mortality and readmission as outcomes, and the set of variables

included in the respective risk-adjustment models of the CMS from inpatient and outpatient
claims before any expansion of the code slots. The regression coefficients for the variables in
these models represent the contribution of each covariate to the risk of readmission and
mortality among patients. Next, we identified covariates that were associated with the highest
risk of death and readmission across the 3 HRRP conditions based on their regression
coefficients relative to others. We evaluated temporal trends in the capture of these conditions
for each of the 4 covariate selection strategies. Finally, we assessed how the overall risk of
mortality and readmission, based on the model changed across the expansion of the codes.
All other analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (Cary, NC), and Stata 14
(College Station, TX). The level of significance was set at 0.05. The study was reviewed by the
Yale University Institutional Review Board and deemed exempt from informed consent due to
the deidentified data.

RESULTS
There were 2,102,509 eligible hospitalizations for HF, 872,734 for AMI and 1,824,079 for
pneumonia over the study period (eFigures 1-3).
Change in Number of Risk Factors
The average number of risk factors increased across all covariate selection strategies. There
was a relative increase in the average number of covariates in the strategies that used all
inpatient codes after expansion the code slots for all 3 conditions (Figure 1, and eFigure 4).
There was a relative excess increase in mean covariates count at code announcement of 0.9%
(level change in interrupted time series model, 95% CI 0.7% to 1.1%), in heart failure, 0.6%
(0.5% to 0.7%) for AMI and 0.6% (0.4% to 0.8%) for pneumonia, relative to a strategy that
consistently used only 9 inpatient codes (Table 1).

In the strategy that used both inpatient and outpatient codes for assessing risk factors,
there was a smaller but significant relative increase in the average number of codes when all
codes were used after inpatient code slot expansion compared with a strategy that combined
the used a fixed number of inpatient codes with all outpatient codes (Figure 1). There was a
0.6% (0.4% to 0.8%) increase in covariates for heart failure, 0.4% (0.3% to 0.5%) for AMI, and
0.3% (0.1% to 0.6%) in pneumonia. There was a small but significant continued relative
increase in covariates captured in strategies using all codes in AMI, but not for heart failure or
pneumonia, measured as difference in slopes after accounting for the level change after code
expansion (Table 1).
Changes in Covariates by Risk Contribution
The change in captured risk factors is not consistent across covariates, with a significant
increase in certain covariates, e.g. history of coronary artery bypass grafting, but not others,
such as metastatic cancer and malnutrition. After ordering covariates by their contribution to the
risk of mortality based on the magnitude and direction of the regression coefficient in riskadjustment models, the top 10 covariates experienced changes in covariate frequency that were
similar in magnitude and direction regardless of whether the first 9 or the complete inpatient
claims were used after expansion of code slots, and regardless of the use of outpatient codes
(Table 2, Figure 2, eFigures 5-6). Notably, substantial discordance in relative trends of
covariate were mainly observed for covariates which conferred the lowest risk of mortality in
risk-adjustment models (Table 2, Figure 2, eFigures 5-6). In 30-day readmission models,
however, some of the top 10 covariates demonstrated a relative increase with the use of all
inpatient codes after code slot expansion, relative to strategies that used a fixed number of
codes (eFigures 7-8).
Coded Risk of Mortality and Readmission

Changes in coded severity of illness for the mortality and readmission outcomes were sensitive
to the sources of data. For mortality, across all 3 conditions, after the increase in code slots, the
use of all inpatient codes was associated with a lower coded severity of illness compared with
the strategy using only 9 codes consistently (Figure 3). There were no inflections in the coded
severity with the use of the full complement of inpatient and outpatient codes, compared with
first 9 inpatient with all outpatient claims (P for level change in interrupted time series models >
0.05 for all, Table 1).
The readmission risk score did not increase if both inpatient and outpatient data were
used for identifying covariates regardless of whether all or only 9 inpatient codes were used
after increase in the number of code slots (Table 1). In contrast, if only inpatient codes were
used as the source of the data, there was a relative excess increase in the readmission risk with
code expansion when using all inpatient codes, compared with only 9 inpatient codes.

DISCUSSION
We found that the use of comprehensive inpatient and outpatient codes, with a 12 month look
back, as is done with the CMS measures, blunts the effect of the code expansion on increasing
the comorbidity prevalence. Moreover, the additional covariates identified with the expanded
code slots did not represent conditions that conferred substantial risk of mortality or
readmission. The measured risk of mortality based on either coding strategy was, therefore,
unchanged regardless of the number of codes used after the expansion. The risk of readmission
also did not significantly increase with code expansion if outpatient codes were used in addition
to the inpatient codes.
The expansion of inpatient code slots occurred during a period with several health policy
interventions under the Affordable Care Act.14 The evaluation of these policies has relied on

temporal trends, which use covariates identified from claims to account for changes in patient
characteristics over time. The expansion of codes, and how different evaluations of policy
handled these changes, have specifically been suggested to overestimate the effects of the
national program to reduce readmission.2 However, the study did not use the entire complement
of outpatient claim codes. Our assessment of readmission risk assessed using comprehensive
outpatient codes in addition to the inpatient codes did not find any suggestion for a significant
artifactual increase in readmission risk with using all available codes after the code slots
increased. This effect was limited to assessments of risk that focused only on inpatient claims.
Other studies that have evaluated the effect of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
and reached different conclusions also differ in their use of inpatient vs inpatient and outpatient
data, as well as the use of 9 inpatient or all available codes for risk adjustment.3,5 Our findings of
no inflections in mortality risk with either coding strategy suggests that the differences between
these studies do not arise from the data source or their strategy of handling covariates for risk
adjustment.
The design of the CMS measures, which included inpatient and outpatient codes over
the prior year, was intended to comprehensively characterize comorbidity burden and outcome
risk from multiple sources. Although the intent to expand codes was not known when we
developed the original outcomes measures,11-13,15-17 there was a concern that over-reliance on
the index hospitalization, or hospitalizations alone, could yield to gaming strategies. Including
comprehensive data made it more difficult for coding strategies by institutions to influence the
risk adjustment. Our study indicates that this strategy also mitigated the effect of the coding rule
change.
The study has certain limitations. We are unable to identify the coding strategies that
best correspond to the actual patient severity over time and are only limited to comparing
relative changes across different coding strategies. Moreover, the study does not account for

heterogeneity in coding changes across US hospitals and has mainly focused on the evaluation
of overall trends. The analyses focus on the period around the code expansion, using a fixed
code strategy as the control. However, we are unable to quantify the effect of the code
expansion on the quality of this control group in the years beyond the analysis period.
In conclusion, the expansion of inpatient code slots led to the identification of a larger
number of covariates included in risk-adjusted models across the transition. However, the
additional covariates did not meaningfully affect the measurement of the risk of mortality or
readmission, especially if both inpatient and outpatient claims were used, as the additional
covariates only included conditions without a significant influence on risk adjusted models. The
hypothesis that strategies of covariate selection to risk-adjust, therefore, does not explain
temporal trends in readmission and mortality.
