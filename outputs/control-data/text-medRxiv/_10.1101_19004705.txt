Abstract
Background: The UK Biobank cohort study has become a much-utilised and influential scientific
resource. With a primary goal of understanding disease aetiology, the low response to the original survey
of 5.5% has, however, led to debate as to the generalisability of these findings. We therefore compared
risk factor–disease estimations in UK Biobank with those from 18 nationally representative studies with
conventional response rates.
Methods: We used individual-level baseline data from UK Biobank (N=502,655) and a pooling of data
from the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Surveys (SHS), comprising 18
studies and 89,895 individuals (mean response rate 68%). Both study populations were aged 40-69 years
at study induction and linked to national cause-specific mortality registries.
Findings: Despite a typically more favourable risk factor profile and lower mortality rates in UK Biobank
participants relative to the HSE-SHS consortium, risk factors–endpoints associations were directionally
consistent between studies, albeit with some heterogeneity in magnitude. For instance, for cardiovascular
disease mortality, the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for ever having
smoked cigarettes (versus never) was 2.04 (1.87, 2.24) in UK Biobank and 1.99 (1.78, 2.23) in HSE-SHS,
yielding a ratio of hazard ratios close to unity (1.02, 0.88, 1.19; p-value 0.76). For hypertension (versus
none), corresponding results were again in same direction but with a lower effect size in UK Biobank
(1.89; 1.69, 2.11) than in HSE-SHS (2.56; 2.20, 2.98), producing a ratio of hazard ratios below unity
(0.74; 0.62, 0.89; p-value 0.001). A similar pattern of observations were made for risk factors (smoking,
obesity, educational attainment, and physical stature) in relation to different cancer presentations and
suicide whereby the ratios of hazard ratios ranged from 0.57 (0.40, 0.81) and 1.07 (0.42, 2.74).
Interpretation: Despite a low response rate, aetiological findings from UK Biobank appear to be
generalisable to England and Scotland.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The primary objective of UK Biobank is to identify risk factors for chronic diseases and injuries of public
health importance. That the baseline response rate of 5.5% was an order of magnitude lower than
comparable studies has raised concerns about the generalisability of its findings.

Added value of this study
For the first time to our knowledge, we directly compared risk factor–health outcome associations in UK
Biobank with a pooling of individual-level data from 18 nationally-sampled cohort studies drawn from
England and Scotland, all of which have conventional response rates (mean 68%). Risk factor–mortality
associations were directionally the same as comparator studies with some heterogeneity in magnitude.

Implications of all the available evidence
Despite more favourable levels of baseline characteristics and disease-specific mortality rates in UK
Biobank, aetiological findings from UK Biobank appear to be generalisable to England and Scotland.
This suggests that studies with exceptionally low response rates, conducted at scale and with a range of
exposures, have scientific value.

Introduction
Well-designed prospective cohort studies have considerable utility in identifying genetic and
environmental risk factors for an array of somatic and psychiatric disorders. In the numerous contexts
where randomised controlled trials are not feasible, cohort studies provide the best approximation of
causality. While deeply-phenotyped studies have existed for decades, recent technological advances have
led to low-cost, high-throughput methods to quantify genetic variation which, together with
simultaneously expanding prospects for linkage to electronic health and care registries, have made
possible the formulation of cohort studies with the capacity to explore gene-environment combinations at
previously unheralded scale. Several countries have either established such national ‘biobanks’,1,2 are in
the process of data collection,3-5 or are planning such an endeavour.6

One such leading resource is the UK Biobank, an open-access, prospective cohort study comprising over
500,000 middle- and older-aged people.7,8 Since the completion of baseline data collection in 2010, use
has been high, with the study already yielding over 800 peer-reviewed publications.9 While UK Biobank
is rare in its combination of size, and breadth and depth of content, it has an unusually low response to its
baseline survey: of over nine million individuals sent an invitation to participate, only 5.5% did so.10 This
achieved response rate was in part driven by the cost- and time-saving decision not to re-contact
undecided individuals. The project came in under-budget and ahead of schedule.11

Whereas such an approach is procedurally efficient, the long-held view is that epidemiological studies
need to achieve response rates as high as 80% if their findings are to be credible.12,13 Vigorous debates
about the impact of non-response on estimations of chronic disease determinants in UK Biobank, its
primary objective, have ensued.14-23 Concerns seem to rest on the assumption that, relative to a more
representative study, the recently reported more favourable prevalence of selected risk factors and
mortality rates in UK Biobank relative to surveys with a higher response24 will necessarily affect the
generalisability of findings for risk factor–disease associations. The principal investigators of UK
Biobank have consistently maintained that, provided the exposures of interest are sufficiently varied and

the sample suitably large, the generalisability of risk factor–health outcome relationships is assured.11,25,26

To address this central issue of whether risk factors for health outcomes are generalisable in UK Biobank,
we directly compare effect estimates for risk factors known to be linked to major causes of mortality with
those from a pooling of raw data from 18 nationally-sampled cohort studies drawn from England and
Scotland, all of which have a response proportion within the conventional range.27,28 With UK Biobank
data being deployed across a range of scientific disciplines, we chose an array of mortality endpoints and
exposures. Given the nature of our research question, our focus was not on uncovering new risk factors
for these health endpoints, rather, testing risk factor–endpoint associations that are well-established based
on very strong observational and/or experimental evidence. We therefore examined demographic, social,
behavioural, and biomedical risk factors for cardiovascular disease,29,30 in addition to physical stature in
relation to cardiovascular disease and cancer,31-33 and educational attainment and suicide risk.34-37

Methods
We used individual-level data from both UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, and a pooling of
eighteen cohort studies with identical core protocols – the Health Survey for England (HSE; 15 studies)
and the Scottish Health Surveys (SHS; 3 studies) (hereafter, HSE-SHS).28,38,39 The sampling and
procedures of these studies have been well described.7,40 In brief, in UK Biobank, baseline data collection
took place between 2006 and 2010 in 22 research assessment centres across the UK, resulting in a sample
of 502,655 people aged 40 to 69 years (response rate 5.5%). In HSE and SHS, a total of 193,842 people
aged 16-102 years (response rate 68%; range 58-9341) participated in home-based data collection between
1994 and 2008.40 Analyses of HSE-SHS were, however, limited to 89,895 people (48,364 women) to
match the baseline age range in UK Biobank. In UK Biobank, ethical approval was received from the
North-West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee, and the research was carried out in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association. In HSE-SHS, ethical approval for data
collection was granted by the London Research Ethics Council, or local research ethics councils.
Participants in both studies gave informed consent.

Assessment of baseline characteristics
In both UK Biobank and HSE-SHS, physician-diagnosis of chronic disease (diabetes, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease), use of multivitamins, lipid-, blood glucose-, and blood pressure-lowering drugs,
educational attainment, cohabitation status, and cigarette smoking habit were self-reported based on
identical or near-identical enquiries. Although physical activity and alcohol intake were collected using
somewhat different questions, we harmonised data across studies and derived comparable binary
categories (current non-drinker versus the rest; physically inactive versus the rest).

During medical examinations, waist and hip circumference, height and weight were measured directly
using standard protocols. Elevated waist: hip ratio was denoted by ≥0.90 for men and ≥0.85 for women;42
obesity was indicated by a body mass index of ≥30kg/m2.43 Forced expiratory volume in one second, a
measure of pulmonary function, was quantified using spirometry with the best of three (UK Biobank) or
five (HSE-SHS) technically satisfactory blows used. In UK Biobank, seated systolic and diastolic blood
pressure measurements were made twice using the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor
(Omron Healthcare)20 or, exceptionally, a manual sphygmomanometer (6652 people). An average of the
two readings was used herein. In HSE-SHS, three readings were taken using the Dinamap 8100
automated device,44 and a mean of the second and third values was used. We defined hypertension
according to existing guidelines as systolic/diastolic ≥140/90 mmHg and/or use of antihypertensive
medication.45 Non-fasting venous blood was drawn in both studies.46,47 Assaying took place at dedicated
central laboratories for C-reactive protein, glycated haemoglobin, and total and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol.40,46

Ascertainment of cause-specific mortality
Participants in both studies were linked to mortality records using the procedures of the UK National
Health Service Central Registry. Underlying cause of death, coded according to the tenth revision of the
International Classification of Disease, was extracted from death certificate data.48 We generated the

following mortality outcomes: cardiovascular disease, all cancers combined, lung cancer, smoking–
attributable cancers, obesity-attributable cancers, and suicide. The ICD codes denoting these causes of
death are given in supplemental table 1.

Statistical analyses
Hazard ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals were computed using Cox regression models49
and adjusted for age and sex. In these survival analyses we censored individuals according to the date of
death or the end of follow-up (14th February 2011 in HSE, 31st December 2009 in SHS; 22nd February
2016 for UK Biobank) – whichever came first. To quantify the difference between the hazard ratios in
each of the two studies we computed a ratio of the hazard ratio as we have in other contexts48 (UK
Biobank was the referent), and calculated the p-value for difference using Fisher’s Z score, with Z
calculated as the difference between the logarithms of the two study hazard ratios, divided by the square
root of the sum of their variances where Z follows a normal distribution (Z=[β1−β2]/√[SE12+SE22]).50
Analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.

Results
In table 1 (biomedical factors) and supplemental figure 1 (demographic, social, and behavioural factors)
we compare the baseline characteristics of participants in UK Biobank with those in the pooling of the 18
HSE-SHS cohorts. UK Biobank study members were less likely to have had a below-university level
education, to be living alone or unmarried, to be sedentary, have existing cardiovascular disease, or to be
taking pharmacological treatments for raised blood glucose, although the reverse was seen for lipid- and
blood pressure-lowering medications. In analyses restricted to study members not reporting the use of

such therapies, there was essentially no difference between studies members for total and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycosylated haemoglobin. Whereas values for C-reactive protein were
marginally lower in UK Biobank, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were somewhat higher.
Taken together, there was a generally more favourable risk factor profile in UK Biobank study members.

In UK Biobank, there were 14,288 deaths during an average of 7.0 years of follow up in 499,701 people
consenting to be linked to mortality registers. In the pooling of data from HSE-SHS, 10 years of
mortality surveillance gave rise to 7,861 deaths in 89,895 individuals. Of the five mortality categories
examined, there were markedly lower rates of cardiovascular disease, all cancers combined, and tobaccoand obesity-attributable cancers in UK Biobank, whereas the rate of suicide was higher (supplemental
Table 2).

In figure 1, for each dataset, we depict the direction and strength of the relationship of baseline
demographic and behavioural characteristics known to be associated with cardiovascular disease
mortality. All well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease were recapitulated in the present
analyses of both studies. The expected direction of association was the same in both studies for the seven
characteristics, whereby being male, of higher age, being physically inactive, a non-drinker of alcohol,
not being married/cohabiting, a current or former smoker, and not having a higher education degree were
related to elevated rates of cardiovascular disease mortality. There was, however, a difference in the
magnitude of these effects in four of the risk factors examined, and in most of these the hazards ratios
were higher in UK Biobank. When we explored the links between biomedical factors and cardiovascular
disease mortality (figure 2), again, all ten of the biomarkers studied revealed known associations with
cardiovascular disease deaths in both studies. There was also some heterogeneity in the strength of these
relationships for higher levels of glycosylated haemoglobin, existing cardiovascular disease (stronger
effects in UK Biobank than HSE-SHS for both risk factors) and hypertension (the reverse).

Nest, we examined the association of selected baseline factors with some non-cardiovascular mortality

outcomes, including different presentations of cancer and also suicide deaths (figure 3). These known
risk factors were replicated across both studies. The magnitude of the association of cigarette smoking
with lung cancer and malignancies aetiologically linked with tobacco were weaker for UK Biobank,
whereas obesity and obesity-attributed cancers yielded similar associations in each study. Hazard ratios
were also essentially the same for lower educational attainment and suicide although statistical power was
modest in these analyses as evidenced by the wide confidence intervals, particularly for HSE-SHS.
Physical stature revealed the predicted opposing and shallow gradients for cardiovascular disease
(negative) and cancer (positive); again, effect sizes were very similar in both studies.

In sensitivity analyses, we explored the impact of using the same calendar period of study induction in
both UK Biobank and HSE-SHS – whereas baseline in UK Biobank was in fact 2006-2010, the latest
survey for which we have linked data in the HSE-SHS collaboration was 2008. Results of these subgroup
analyses had little impact on our overall conclusions (supplemental figure 2). The only obvious
anomaly was for obesity which might be explained by the small number of cardiovascular disease deaths.
We also examined if results from survival analyses featuring cardiovascular disease as our outcome of
interest differed across studies in gender-specific analyses for demographic and behavioural
characteristics (supplemental figure 3), and biomarkers (supplemental figure 4). There was no
suggestion of this being the case. Lastly, given that there was, as described, a higher use of medication
for blood pressure- and lipid-lowering in members of UK Biobank relative to our comparator cohorts, we
tested if this was also evident for other health-seeking behaviours such as vitamin and mineral
supplementation. The prevalence of such use was in fact lower in UK Biobank (21.8%) than HSE-SHS
(33.1%).

Discussion
Our main finding was that in a comparison of findings between UK Biobank and a pooling of 18 studies
from the HSE-SHS consortium, well-established risk factor–mortality associations were recapitulated.
While these effects estimates were directionally consistent between studies there was some difference in

magnitude. This general similarity of results was apparent despite the response rate in UK Biobank being
an order of magnitude lower than comparator cohorts, and UK Biobank members having a generally more
favourable prevalence of sociodemographic, behavioural, and health characteristics at baseline, and lower
rates of cause-specific mortality during follow-up.

Findings from other studies
The only other analyses of risk factor–disease relationships in UK Biobank against comparison studies of
which we are aware is that for venous thromboembolism in the Emerging Risk factors Collaboration, a
pooling of data from 76 cohort studies.51 The goal of that paper was risk factor discovery as opposed to
testing well-established associations between risk factors and chronic disease. Inter-study comparison
was further hampered by differing endpoint ascertainment and blood-based biomarkers from UK Biobank
not being available at the time of analyses.

As described, UK Biobank investigators, while acknowledging their study has little value in describing
the current prevalence of a risk factor or a disorder – never a stated objective – have attempted to
minimise unease around the investigation of chronic disease aetiology – its primary purpose – by arguing
that generalisable associations with risk factors can be obtained in non-representative samples provided
there are sufficiently large numbers of individuals with a range of exposures.11,25,26 They cite, as
circumstantial evidence, examples of cohort studies drawing on highly selected populations that have
markedly high response rates than UK Biobank – Framingham residents,52 British physicians,53 US
nurses54 – all of which produced results that have subsequently been shown to be transportable to general
population-based studies and have contributed much to the prevention of cardiovascular disease and
selected cancers. Similarly, our present findings mirror those from analyses where we have compared
risk factors for coronary heart disease in another very select group, a cohort of British civil servants (the
Whitehall II prospective cohort study), with those from a cohort based on the general population (the
British Regional Heart Study).55 In those analyses we found near-identical risk factor–disease association
across studies.

Strengths and limitations
The strengths of the present study include the comparison of UK Biobank with well-characterised and
geographical representative studies that have high response rates. Our report inevitably has some
limitations, however. First, whereas UK Biobank includes people from the contiguous countries that
comprise the UK, there were no data from Wales in the comparator studies. Second, whereas core
elements of data collection in the HSE-SHS consortium were constant across studies, scientific themes
for data collection differed from year to year.40 As such, selected biomedical data were not collected in
all cohorts and the analytical sample size was therefore lower for selected analyses. Third, for two
variables – physical activity and alcohol intake – baseline data were not directly comparable between
studies, though we were able to harmonise data into binary groups. Lastly, although blood samples have
been frozen in HSE-SHS, so raising the potential for later genome sequencing, comparison with genetic
risk prediction of chronic disease in UK Biobank are currently not possible.

In conclusion, the finding that UK Biobank reveals similar risk factor–mortality associations to those
evident in comparator studies with conventional response rates would appear to challenge the prevailing
view of a lack of generalisability of aetiological findings in this cohort. This suggests that the cost- and
time-savings resulting from its low response rate did not impact upon scientific utility.

Figure 1. Association of baseline demographic and behavioural characteristics with cardiovascular
disease mortality in UK Biobank and the HSE-SHS cohort studies

Hazard ratios are age- and sex-adjusted with the exception of age and sex which are mutually adjusted. The shaded diamonds
indicate the hazard ratio (HR) and error bars denote the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the relation of each characteristics
with the risk of death outcome. The ratio of hazard ratio (RHR) summarises the difference (HSE-SHS is the referent group)
between that effect estimates for the outcome, and the p-value is to determine if the observed differences between groups are
significant. In both studies, the sample size is the maximum number with baseline data; numbers are lower for selected
variables.

glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein, and HDL-cholesterol were skewed, hence they were log2-transformed and effect estimates reflect a
doubling in the biomarker. Elevated waist: hip ratio was denoted by ≥0.90 for men and ≥0.85 for women; obesity was indicated by a body mass index of ≥30
kg/m2. CVD, cardiovascular disease; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in one second; HDL, high-density lipoprotein. In both studies, the sample size is the

Biobank and the HSE-SHS cohort studies

Hazard ratios are age- and sex-adjusted. The shaded diamonds indicate the hazard ratio (HR) and error bars denote the 95%
confidence interval (CI) for the relation of each characteristics with the risk of death outcome. The ratio of hazard ratio (RHR)
summarises the difference (HSE-SHS is the referent group) between that effect estimates for the outcome, and the p-value is to
determine if the observed differences between groups are significant. Analyses for education were based on less than
university education versus the rest; a body mass index of ≥30 kg/m2 for obesity; and a per 5 cm increase in height. In both
studies, the sample size is the maximum number with baseline data; numbers are lower for selected variables.

*Selected comparisons have been published by Fry and others24 using published results from four HSE studies (2006, 2008,
2009, and 2010). Our analyses are based on analyses of raw data from 18 cohort studies from England and Scotland which
include two of those HSE studies (2006, 2008). Analyses comprise 502,655 people in UK Biobank and 89,895 in HSE-SHS.
