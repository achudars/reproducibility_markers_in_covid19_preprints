Abstract
Introduction: Pterygium is a disfiguring disease that can potentially lead to blindness
and has a significant public health problem in rural areas. It is more common in warm,
windy and dry climates of tropical and sub-tropical “pterygium belt” regions of Africa,
including Ethiopia. Globally, the prevalence ranging from 0.07% to 53%. Studies
conducted on the prevalence of pterygium in developing countries like Ethiopia were
limited with wider discrepancy between them.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of pterygium and
associated factors among adults in Kolla Diba town, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019.

Method: A community-based cross-sectional study was done in Kolla Diba town from
May 30-June 16, 2019. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select 627
study participants. Data was collected through basic ophthalmic examination with portable
slit lamp, 3x magnifying loop and torchlight and a pretested structured questionnaire was
administered to collect the data. Then the data entered into EPI INFO version 7 and
analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression
analysis were employed. P-values of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Result: A total of 605 study participants were involved with a response rate of 96.5%.
Among them 317 (52.4%) participants were males. The mean age of the respondents was
38.18 ± 15.56 with a range of (18-95) in years. The overall Prevalence of pterygium among
adults living in Kolla Diba town was 112 (18.5% (95% CI (15.6- 21.7)). Being widowed

(AOR = 7.32 (95%CI: 2.88, 18.57)), outdoor occupation (AOR = 2.50 (95%CI: 1.46,
4.29)), sun exposure (AOR = 2.38 (95%CI: 1.28, 4.43)), wind exposure (AOR = 1.97
(95%CI: 1.04, 3.72)), alcohol drinking (AOR = 2.26 (95%CI: 1.48, 4.63)), and severe
blepharitis (AOR = 2.45 (95%CI: 1.48, 4.05)) had statistically significant positive
association with pterygium.

Conclusion: The prevalence of pterygium was relatively higher. Marital status (being
widowed), outdoor occupation, sun exposure, wind exposure, alcohol drinking, and severe
blepharitis were significantly associated with the development of pterygium.

Introduction
Pterygium is a benign, radially oriented, fleshy triangular/wingy shaped abnormal fibrovascular growth of the conjunctiva encroaching towards the central cornea in either one or
both eyes [1,2]. The main clinical presentations are redness, irritation, foreign body
sensation, decreased vision and ocular discomfort [3,4]. The severity of pterygium can be
graded as grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 based on the location of pterygium head encroachment on the
cornea [5,6]. Genetics and other environmental factors such as wind, dry atmosphere, dust,
chemicals, air pollution, geographical location, and hereditary factors may contribute for
the development of pterygium [7]. Pterygium is more common in warm, windy and dry
climates of tropical and subtropical regions [8,9]. The burden of pterygium is higher among
individuals who live in rural residence, low economic status, illiterates, and outdoor
workers, who spend a greater part of the day outdoor under excessive sun exposure, wind,
and dust [10–13].
Globally, the prevalence of pterygium ranges from 0.07% to 53% worldwide and 8.0% to
38.7% in Africa [2,3,6,12,14,15]. In Ethiopia, the prevalence was 8.8% in Meskan district,
Southern Ethiopia and 38.7% in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia [2,16].
Untreated pterygium may lead to visual impairment, cosmetic problems, restriction of
ocular motility, significant socioeconomic problems and reduced quality of life [17–21].
Even though, the consequence is higher, it is possible to minimize the chances of being
afflicted with pterygium by wearing UV protective sun glasses, wide-brimmed hats, caps
and using umbrella to reduce the exposure to environmental irritants [2,6,10,15,22,23].

Pterygium is a common ophthalmic condition in “pterygium belt” regions, located between
latitudes 40° N and 40 ° S of the equator [7,15,24]. The exposure to environmental factors
is also higher in Africa including Ethiopia but there is a scarcity of evidence on the
prevalence of pterygium in this region [13,25–29]. Therefore, this study aimed to
determine the prevalence and associated factors of pterygium among adults in Kolla Diba
town. The result of this study will be important for planning and implementing health care
services and also act as base line data for further studies.

Methods and Materials
Study design, setting and sampling
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolla Diba town, Northwest
Ethiopia, located 712km from the capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. The altitude of the
town is 1827m above sea level. According to statistical data from Dembiya woreda
Administrative office, Kolla Diba town has a total population of 25,831 with three kebeles
including 5328 households. The total number of adults (≥ 18 years) living in Kolla Diba
town was 15,534. In the town, there is one primary hospital and one health center.
A total of 627 sample size was determined by single proportional formula by considering
10% non-response rate. In the study, 605 study participants were recruited and completed
the questionnaire along with basic ophthalmic examinations with a response rate of 96.5%.
Households from all kebeles were chosen by using systematic random sampling technique
with a sampling fraction of eight. The first household was selected by lottery method
between, the 1st & 8th household and then continued in every 8th household. Finally, one
adult in each participating household with age ≥ 18 years old was randomly selected and
recruited as study participant.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by
the University of Gondar Ethical Review Board. In accordance with the Ethiopian National
Research Ethics Review Guideline, verbal informed consent was obtained from all adults

≥18 years old using an information sheet in the local language “Amharic”. Since the study
didn’t involve invasive eye examination procedures, the university ethical review board
approved verbal informed consent. The study participants’ agreements were first obtained

verbally prior to data collection. Then the data was collected by trained senior optometrists.
Those adults who had pterygium were prescribed sunglass and referred to the University of
Gondar tertiary eye care and training center for further examination and management.

Operational definition
Sun exposure divided into two groups by crude cut off value of sun exposure duration: a
participant who exposed to sunlight for above or equal to 5hrs per day considered as
exposed, whereas less than 5hrs per day considered as non-exposed [26].

Grading of pterygium
Grade 1: head of a pterygium at the limbus
Grade 2: head of a pterygium between the limbus and the un-dilated pupil margin
Grade 3: head of a pterygium at the pupil margin
Grade 4: head of a pterygium within the pupil margin [35]

Data collection
The pre-tested and structured questionnaire of local language ‘Amharic’ was used to carry
out interview with adults’ ≥18 years old (S1 Questionnaire). The study tools were pretested
in a nearby area of study site that had not been sampled (Chuahit), on 5% of the sample
who fulfilled the sampling inclusion criteria, to validate questions and observations. The
collected data from study participants include information’s on socio-demographic

characteristic, behavioral/ lifestyle related factors and environmental factors. Face to face
interview by using standardized questionnaires were conducted on those selected
participants. Standard basic ophthalmic examination by using portable slit lamp, torch light
and 3x magnifying loop were done by trained senior optometrists in order to rule out the
diagnosis of pterygium. On the fieldwork, the quality of data was cross checked (5% of the
filled questionnaire) for completeness, accuracy, and clarity through supervision on daily
basis.

Statistical analysis
After coding, the data was entered into EPI INFO 7, exported and analyzed by using SPSS
version 20. The descriptive statistics were carried out to compute different proportions and
summary statistics. Model fitness was checked by using the Hosmer and Lemeshow.
Variables were fitted into the model by using the backward stepwise method. The
analytical statistics was done by using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Those
variables with 95% CI and p-value less than 0.05 were considered as statistically
significant factors of pterygium.

Results
A total of 605 participants were recruited and completed the questionnaire along with basic
ophthalmic examinations with a response rate of 96.5%. Among them 317 (52.4%)
participants were males. The mean age of the respondents was 38.18 ± 15.56 with a range
of (18-95) in years. Majority 188 (31.1%) of the respondents completed secondary school
and almost half of the participants got married 303 (50.1%). Most of the participants were
indoor workers 410 (67.8%). Majority of the participants had an income of ≤ 1000 ETB
from monthly median income of 2075.50 ETB. Table 1.
Study participants who exposed to dust and wind were 337 (55.7%) and 350 (57.9%)
respectively. Participants who exposed to sunlight for more than 5hrs per day were 280
(46.3%) and half of the respondents 302 (49.9%) spend most of their time on outdoor
activities. Table 2. From the total study participants only 171 (28.3%) study participants
used sunglass or hat. Most of the study participants never smoked cigarettes, no history of
dry eye and hypertension with 518 (85.6%), 503 (83.1%) and 558 (92.2%) respectively.
Table 3.
The overall prevalence of pterygium among adults living in Kolla Diba town was 112
(18.5% (95% CI (15.6-21.7)). Among those participants, 65 (58%) had unilateral
pterygium. Majority of the participants 87 (77.7%) had pterygium on the nasal side and the
rest 12 (10.7%) had temporal and 13 (11.6%) had double pterygium. Most of the study
participants had grade 1 pterygium, 63 (56.3%) followed by grade 2 pterygium, 38 (33.9%)
and the rest grade 3 and 4 accounts less than 8% in total. Table 4.

From the Bi-variable logistic regression analysis; factors like age, gender, marital status,
educational status, occupation, dust exposure, sun exposure, wind exposure, duration on
outdoor activities, use of sunglass or hat, drinking status, smoking status, use of traditional
eye medication, severe blepharitis, history of dry eye and history of hypertension were
independently associated with pterygium with the significant level of p < 0.20.
In multivariable logistic regression analysis factors such as marital status, occupation, sun
exposure, wind exposure, drinking status, and severe blepharitis had statistically significant
association with pterygium. This study found that there is a positive association between
marital status (being widowed) and the development of pterygium. The odds of developing
pterygium among widowed participants were 7 times more likely as compared to single
participants (AOR = 7.32 (95%CI: 2.88, 18.57)). Outdoor occupation workers such as
farmers, daily laborers, taxi drivers, vendors, construction workers, etc. were 2.50 times
smore likely to develop pterygium as compared to indoor workers such as office workers,
teachers and so on (AOR = 2.50 (95%CI: 1.46, 4.29)).
Participants who had exposed to wind were 2 times more likely to develop pterygium than
non-exposed (AOR = 1.97 (95%CI: 1.04, 3.72)). Alcohol drinking had a positive
association with pterygium and those participants who had currently drink alcohol were
2.62 times more likely to develop pterygium as compared to non-drinkers (AOR = 2.26
(95%CI: 1.48, 4.63)). The odds of developing pterygium on study participants who
exposed to sun were 2.38 times more likely than non-exposed (AOR = 2.38 (95%CI: 1.28,
4.43)). Those participants who had severe blepharitis were 2.45 times higher risk of
developing pterygium (AOR = 2.45 (95%CI: 1.48, 4.05)). Table 5.

Discussion
The prevalence of pterygium from various studies in the world shows considerable
variation, ranging from 0.07% to 53% depending on the difference in various geographical
and environmental factors [2,3,38,39].
In this community-based cross-sectional study the prevalence of pterygium among adults
living in Kolla Diba town was 112 (18.5% (95% CI; 15.6–21.7)). This finding is lower as
compared to the study conducted, in Gondar city (Ethiopia) 38.7% [2]. This discrepancy
might be due to the difference in socioeconomic status and reference age group. In the
study conducted in Gondar city 71% of the study participants had low monthly income (<
1000 ETB). But here in this study only 28.4% of the study participants had low monthly
income. As previous studies described as low economic status had positively associated
with the prevalence of pterygium [11,26,28,37,48]. Another reason might be age cut off
point as the present study involved all available inhabitants aged ≥18 years as compared to
the study conducted in Gondar city (age >20 years). In contrast to few other studies, this
study also shows lower prevalence than other studies conducted in Ghana 31.0% [18],
30.8% in Kumejima (Southwest Japan) [36], 37.46% in Duomen County (Republic of
China) [39] and 36.6% in Amazon Basin (Brazil) [31]. This variation might be due to the
difference in the target population, ethnicity and altitudinal variation.
This finding is higher when compared it with the study conducted in Meskan district,
Southern Ethiopia which was 8.80% [16]. This variation might be due to the difference in
target population and ethnicity (the prevalence of pterygium varied among different ethnic
groups) [5,9,24,49]. The present study shows higher prevalence of pterygium in

comparison to other studies conducted in Saudi Arabia (Alkhobar) 0.07% [38], 13.0% in
Rural agrarian central India [22], 10.53% in China (Shandong province) [20], 4.40% in
Japan [1], 8.80% in South Korea [26], 2.3% in Russia, 8.12% in Brazil (Sao Paulo
(Botucato city)) [32], 11.24% in Hawaii [24], 5.90% in Spain [3], and 1.09% in Portugal
[33]. This discrepancy might be due to the difference in geographical location, climatic
change, altitudinal variation, life style and other environmental factors. Most of the above
studies also done on older adults (40 years and above).
The present study finding is laying in between the highest and the lowest prevalence among
different epidemiological studies in the world. This finding is in line with the study
conducted in Southeastern Nigeria, Central Myanmar and in Riau Archipelago (tropical
islands of Indonesia) which was 19.3%, 19.6% and 17.0% respectively [23,35,50]. This is
because Ethiopia, Nigeria, Central Myanmar and Riau Archipelago (Indonesia) located in
similar geographical region (pterygium belt tropical regions) in the tropics near the equator.
These studies also had similar age group reference and study design.
In many works of literatures marital status had no direct association with pterygium
[2,13,28]. But here in this study marital status (being widowed) had a positive association
with pterygium. The present study shows widowed participants who had developed
pterygium were older in age. The reason may be due to aging since in this study widowed
participants were older in age, despite still in debate many authors revealed that pterygium
is a degenerative (aging) disorder of the conjunctival tissue that leads to vascular
proliferation [2,11,30,49,51]. However; Age had no association with pterygium in this
study which is one part of the debate “It is not just a degenerative disease but may be a
proliferative disorder of the ocular surface”. Therefore it is due to multifactorial which

include genetics (which plays an important role in the pathogenesis) and other
environmental factors such as wind, dry atmosphere, dust, chemicals and air pollution may
contribute for the development of pterygium [2,7,15,40,52].
Outdoor occupation was significantly associated with the increased prevalence of
pterygium. This finding was supported by plenty of previous literature as an outdoor
occupation is usually associated with many environmental factors like excessive UV
radiation and dust exposure that predisposed to the development of pterygium [15,37,44].
For instance, Nepalese people are equally involved in outdoor activities like farming,
animal rearing, and manual labor in order to balance their needs thus increased exposure to
potential risk factors like ultraviolet radiation in outdoor jobs [51]. Another study showed
that people who spend more than three-quarters of their day outside were more likely to
develop pterygium, thus outdoor activity is frequently associated with the degree of UVAF
and can damage limbal stem cells by activation of matrix metalloproteinase and leads to
pterygium [15,40,45,52].
This study found that there is a positive association between sun exposure and the
development of pterygium. This might be due to the fact that prolonged ultraviolet
exposure causes biological change in Bowman's membrane and that altered proteins so
formed could then act as an angiogenic or 'pterygiogenic' factor [24,28,40]. Many other
previous studies also found a strong positive association between sun exposure and
pterygium as excessive sun exposure cause damage to limbal stem cells by activation of
matrix metalloproteinase which leads to pterygium [24–26,37,40,42].

There was also a positive association between wind exposure and the prevalence of
pterygium. This finding is supported by the study conducted in Hawaii, showed that
increased risk of exposure to wind while surfing and doing outdoor activities may
contribute to pterygium development due to the entrance of airborne debris in to the eye
[24].
According to this study, alcohol drinking had a positive association with pterygium. This
finding is also supported by previous studies and described as alcohol consumption was
another lifestyle-related factor related to low socioeconomic status that leads to the
development of pterygium [15,37]. But contrary to this, a study conducted in Xinjiang,
China revealed that alcohol consumption had no influence on the development of
pterygium [9].
A significant association between severe blepharitis and pterygium were found and
different authors reported similar finding. For instance, A study in Israel and others showed
that severe blepharitis was significantly associated with pterygium development [13,21,28].
In severe blepharitis, the inflammation and oxidative stress may play a putative role in
pterygium pathogenesis by increasing the damage caused by UV radiation on the limbal
basal stem cells and accelerating the multistep mutation pathway that leads to pterygium
formation. Again in severe blepharitis, there is tear film abnormality which may cause a
predisposition to the proliferation of fibro-vascular tissue [28].
Some of the data were subject to recall bias from study participants. This study didn’t
conduct laboratory investigations in order to rule out other findings related to pterygium
such as OSSN (ocular surface squamous neoplasia] and this may compromise the result.

Being a cross-sectional study was also another limitation. It’s difficult to determine
causality between the risk factors and pterygium in this study.

Conclusion
The prevalence of pterygium in Kolla diba town is about 18.5%, which is relatively higher.
Marital status (being widowed], outdoor occupation, alcohol drinking, severe blepharitis,
excessive sun exposure and wind exposure had statistical significant associated factors for
the development of pterygium.
