ABSTRACT

Purpose: The objectives of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS
(IeDEA) are to (i) evaluate the delivery of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
children, adolescents and adults in sub-Saharan Africa, (ii) to describe ART regimen
effectiveness, durability and tolerability, (iii) to examine HIV-related comorbidities and
co-infections, and (iv) to examine the pregnancy- and HIV-related outcomes of women
on ART and their infants exposed to HIV or antiretroviral therapy in utero or via
breastmilk.
Participants: IeDEA is organized in four regions (Central, East, Southern and West
Africa), with 240 treatment and care sites, six data centres at African, European and US
universities, and almost 1.4 million children, adolescents and adult people living with HIV
(PLWHIV) enrolled.
Findings to date: The data include socio-demographic characteristics, clinical
outcomes, opportunistic events, treatment regimens, clinic visits and laboratory
measurements. They have been used to analyse outcomes in people living with HIV-1
or HIV-2 who initiate ART, including determinants of mortality, of switching to secondline and third-line ART, drug resistance, loss to follow-up and the immunological and
virological response to different ART regimens. Programme-level estimates of mortality
have been corrected for loss to follow-up. We examined the impact of co-infection with
hepatitis B and C, and the epidemiology of different cancers and of (multi-drug resistant)
tuberculosis, renal disease and of mental illness. The adoption of “Treat All”, making
ART available to all PLWHIV regardless of CD4+ cell count or clinical stage was another
important research topic.
Future plans: IeDEA has formulated several research priorities for the “Treat All” era in
sub-Saharan Africa. It recently obtained funding to set up sentinel sites where additional
data are prospectively collected on cardiometabolic risks factors as well as mental
health and liver diseases, and is planning to create a drug resistance database.

INTRODUCTION
The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa from
2004 onwards has substantially improved the prognosis of HIV-1 infection, with a
decline in AIDS-related deaths [1] and a decline in the incidence of new HIV-1 infections
[2]. However, in many settings HIV/AIDS is still a public health threat. An estimated 1.8
million new infections occurred in 2017 and almost a million adult and child deaths were
due to HIV, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa [2].
The World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and many of the countries most heavily affected by the HIV
epidemic have committed to ending HIV/AIDS as a major public health problem by
2030.[1] Targets to be reached by 2020 include that 90% of people living with HIV
(PLWHIV) be aware of their status, 90% of those diagnosed initiate ART, and 90% of
those on ART achieve undetectable viral loads (the 90-90-90 targets) [3]. Progress
towards these goals has been substantial, especially in the most affected regions of
Eastern and Southern Africa. The latest estimates suggested that the two regions are on
track and had achieved 76%, 79% and 83% of the 90-90-90 targets, respectively in
2017 [4]. West and Central Africa face difficulties with the first 90% target and only an
estimated 42% of PLWHIV in these regions were aware of their status [4].
Established more than ten years ago by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the
International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) are a global cohort
collaboration that collects HIV/AIDS data from HIV care and treatment programs,
including in sub-Saharan Africa. The regional IeDEA data centres consolidate, curate
and analyse data to evaluate the outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS and monitor
progress. The first years of the cohorts in sub-Saharan Africa were described previously
[5]; here we provide an update on methods, key data and future plans.
COHORT DESCRIPTION
In 2006 the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) sought
applications for a global consortium structured through regional centres to pool clinical
and epidemiological data on PLWHIV, in order to address questions that could not be
answered by individual cohorts [5]. IeDEA covers seven geographic regions, namely

North America, the Caribbean and Central/South America, the Asia-Pacific and four
regions in sub-Saharan Africa: West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa and Southern
Africa. The project was initially funded for a 5-year period and has since been extended
twice, with the current funding cycle ending in 2021.
Settings and number of PLWHIV enrolled
To date, the African regions of IeDEA received data from 240 HIV care and treatment
facilities in 19 sub-Saharan African countries (Figure 1A). Close to 1,400,000 PLWHIV
who initiated ART in sub-Saharan Africa are included (Figure 1B), of whom over
680,000 are currently in care. In East and Southern Africa, both urban and rural facilities
are well represented, while in Central and West Africa, urban facilities dominate.
Facilities are predominately public (95%) and operated at the primary or secondary
care level, with the exception of West Africa where 70% of facilities are at the tertiary
level of care (Table 1).
Data collection at individual and site level
Since its inception, IeDEA has collected routine clinical data of PLWHIV followed under
treatment, which includes socio-demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes,
opportunistic events, treatment regimens, clinic visits and laboratory measurements.
More recently, the IeDEA network has developed a Data Exchange Standard (DES)
protocol (see www.iedeades.org) with 25 data tables, which include a total of 228 unique
variables (36 compulsory and 192 additional variables) and within-region unique patient
research identifiers. Standardized data collection is supported by eight codebooks,
including the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification for drugs and lists
with codes for reasons for stopping treatment, for dropping out of the cohort, for mode of
HIV infection, country, type and site of comorbidities, laboratory measurements and
units of measurements and type of viral load assay. The collection, management and
sharing of data is facilitated by the Harmonist toolkit, a software and standards package
that supports research projects through the Research Electronic Data Capture
(REDCap) system [6].
In recent years, site assessments and site surveys have been conducted on a regular
basis to collect up-to-date information related to available clinical service and care

models in the participating facilities. For example, a study compared the characteristics
and comprehensiveness of adult HIV care and treatment programmes in sub-Saharan
Africa with programmes in the Americas and Asia-Pacific region [7]. Other studies
examined the management of mental health and substance use disorders [8], or the
diagnostic and screening practices for (drug resistant) tuberculosis in adult and
paediatric patients [9–11]. Furthermore, the routine data collected by participating sites
have been enriched in some countries by linking the routine HIV databases to cancer
registries [12,13], vital registries [14] or administrative databases [15].
Trends in CD4 cell count and viral load measurements
While WHO continues to recommend a CD4 cell count before starting ART to inform the
management of advanced disease and differentiated care in the Treat All era, it also
recommends that CD4 testing be replaced by viral load measurement for monitoring of
treatment and identification of treatment failure [16]. Figure 2 shows that in Southern
and West Africa, the number of CD4 measurements tended to be stable over time,
despite an increasing number of PLWHIV in care, while in East and Central Africa the
number of CD4 measurements dropped. At present, 53% of the active facilities reported
routine CD4 testing and 65% routine viral load testing (Table 1). The United States
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which provides substantial
funding for AIDS treatment, care and prevention in countries most affected by the
epidemic, has progressively reduced its support for CD4 testing [17].
Trends in antiretroviral therapy
Until recently, the recommended first-line ART regimen in sub-Saharan Africa consisted
of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and one non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (2NRTIs+1NNRTI). The combination of tenofovir (TDF),
lamivudine (3TC) (or emtricitabine (FTC)) and efavirenz (EFV) is the current treatment of
choice. The phasing out of stavudine (D4T) and nevirapine (NVP) was almost complete
in 2014 (Table 2). East Africa and Southern Africa are currently rolling out dolutegravir
(DTG), an integrase inhibitor with a high barrier to resistance [18][19]. Due to concerns
about an increased risk of neural tube defects if taken during pregnancy[20], the roll-out
to women has been delayed or limited in some settings. Of note, drug stock-outs in the

last 12 months were reported by 59 facilities for first-line drugs, and by 45 for secondline drugs (Table 1).
Mortality and retention in care
In cohorts of PLWHIV who initiated ART in consecutive two-year periods from 2001 to
2016, mortality at 3 years declined substantially in all African IeDEA regions (Figure 3A).
Loss to follow-up, defined as more than 90 days late to the next scheduled visit,
remained substantial in all regions, and particularly high in Southern Africa (Figure 3B).
Retention in care is key to the success of the public health approach to ART. Loss to
follow-up has been an important issue for IeDEA, and activities to trace PLWHIV not
returning to the clinic have increased in recent years. At present, tracing of PLWHIV on
ART who were lost to follow-up is in place in 89% of the active facilities; 75% have
implemented it routinely (Table 1). Tracing methods vary widely across facilities and
include phone calls and home visits by clinic staff or community health workers.
Patient and public involvement
IeDEA is based on the collection of routine clinical data and no patients were involved in
developing the research question, outcome measures and overall design of the
collaboration. Due to the anonymous nature of the data, we cannot disseminate the
results of analyses of the data directly to study participants.
KEY RESEARCH AREAS AND PUBLICATIONS
Over 500 publications in MEDLINE acknowledge funding from a core grant from the NIH
to one or several African IeDEA regions, and these publications have been cited over
10,000 times. Multiregional projects are developed in IeDEA working groups, which
currently address eight clinical areas: (i) cancer, (ii) ART outcomes, (iii) hepatitis, (iv)
mental health, (v) mother-infant and paediatrics, (vi) renal disease, (vii) substance use
and (viii) tuberculosis. Multiregional research concepts are discussed in the Executive
Committee of IeDEA, revised and approved or rejected. In recent years, several
analyses were done in collaboration with WHO or UNAIDS [21–23]. The number of
publications reporting multi-regional analyses from several African IeDEA regions
increased over time, from one such publication in 2007 to 24 multiregional publications

in 2018. Some of the key studies are summarised below, with a focus on more recent
and on multiregional analyses.
Treatment outcomes in adults, adolescents, children and pregnant women:
Several studies examined outcomes in people living with HIV-1 or HIV-2 who initiate
ART, including determinants of mortality, of switching to second-line and third-line ART,
drug resistance, loss to follow-up and the immunological and virological response to
different ART regimens [24–37]. For example, the African IeDEA regions contributed
importantly to a large-scale analysis of outcomes in adolescents living with perinatally
acquired HIV, which showed that HIV-associated mortality during adolescence was
substantially higher in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and South
America and the Caribbean than in Europe [36]. A similar analysis of adolescents living
with HIV showed that mortality and loss to follow-up were worse among those entering
care at 15 years or older [37]. The authors concluded that adolescents must be
evaluated separately from younger children and adults to identify population-specific
reasons for death and loss to follow-up [37].
Programme-level mortality: It became clear early on during the scale-up of ART in
sub-Saharan Africa, that loss to follow-up of patients initiating ART was substantial [38],
and that mortality among patients lost was higher than among patients remaining in care
[39]. Ignoring loss to follow-up might thus bias programme-level estimates of mortality,
and much effort has gone into correcting programme-level mortality for loss to follow-up
[40–46]. For example, an analysis of all four African regions showed that when
analysing the uncorrected data observed in the clinics, 52% of adults and children were
retained on ART, 42% were lost to follow-up and 6% had died 5 years after ART
initiation [46]. After accounting for undocumented deaths and self-transfers, an
estimated 67% of patients were retained on ART, 19% had stopped ART and 15% had
died [46].
Co-infections and co-morbidities: IeDEA investigators have examined the prevalence
and impact of co-infection with hepatitis B and C, and the epidemiology of different
cancers and of (multi-drug resistant) tuberculosis, renal disease and of mental illness
[8,47–58]. For example, an analysis of IeDEA data and data from the Collaboration of
Observational HIV Epidemiological Research in Europe (COHERE) [59] showed that

children living with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa, but not those from Europe or Asia had
a high risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma after starting ART [58]. Similarly, a recent
analysis of IeDEA and COHERE data showed that compared to European women, rates
of cervical cancer were 11 times higher in South Africa [50]. A recent multiregional study
of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis included HIV positive and HIV negative adults with
tuberculosis from seven high-burden countries (Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Peru, and Thailand). Molecular or phenotypic
drug susceptibility testing was done locally and at a reference laboratory. The results
showed that inaccurate local drug susceptibility testing led to under-treatment of drugresistant tuberculosis and increased mortality [54].
The challenge of “Treat All”: Nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa have now
adopted national polices to offer ART to all PLWHIV regardless of CD4 cell count or
clinical stage (‘Treat All’), in order to meet the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. In 2011,
Malawi was one of the first countries to implement such a strategy for the prevention of
mother-to-child

transmission

(PMTCT),

recommending

ART

for

pregnant

and

breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count or WHO clinical stage
(“Option B+”). An IeDEA analysis of the Malawian experience showed that poor
retention in care was a problem in many facilities, with early loss to follow-up particularly
high in facilities with a high patient volume and in patients who start ART during
pregnancy on the day of HIV diagnosis [35]. More recently, IeDEA investigators used
regression discontinuity analysis to examine changes in rapid HIV treatment initiation
after national “Treat All” policy adoption in six countries (Burundi, Kenya, Malawi,
Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia) [60]. They showed a strong and sustained effect of the
adoption of "Treat All" policies on ART initiation within 30 days of enrollment in HIV care
in all six countries [60].
THE FUTURE
At the end of 2018, IeDEA published a consensus statement [61] and a journal
supplement [62] on research priorities to inform the implementation of the “Treat All”
policy in children and adolescents[63], pregnant and post-partum women [64], and for
mental health, substance use [65] and drug resistance [66]. These documents will guide

IeDEA’s future research agenda in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, the creation of an
IeDEA Sentinel Research Network (IeDEA-SRN) will facilitate the collection of detailed
data in selected IeDEA sites on cardio-metabolic risk factors (e.g. hypertension,
diabetes, dyslipidaemia) liver disease (liver fibrosis and steatosis) , mental health and
substance use. In the East and Southern African regions, pharmacovigilance in
pregnancy is being developed to assess the impact of ART on birth outcomes. A project
involving all four African regions studies the cascade of screening for cervical cancer,
while the establishment of the South African HIV Cancer Match (SAM) study of over ten
million PLWHIV, from linkage of national laboratory with cancer registry data, will allow
the study of less common cancers. Finally, the creation of a drug resistance database as
a central repository for resistance tests performed in routine clinical care is another
planned addition.
COLLABORATIONS
The African regions of IeDEA have collaborated and continue to encourage
collaborations with other consortia, cohort collaborations, the HIV modelling community
and public health agencies as well as individuals wishing to use IeDEA data. Examples
include work with COHERE [50,58,67,68], the Collaborative Initiative for Paediatric HIV
Education and Research (CIPHER) collaboration [36,69] or the Measurement &
Surveillance of HIV Epidemics (MeSH) consortium [22] as well as UNAIDS [22,23] and
WHO [21]. Furher collaborations are welcome. Investigators wishing to work with the
IeDEA data should contact the teams at the regional data centres (see www.iedea.org
for contact details) and send a concept sheet for the analyses they are interested in
performing and the variables that would be required. Anyone wishing to work with IeDEA
must sign a data-use agreement.

Box: Strengths and limitations of this study
•

An important strength of the IeDEA cohort collaboration in sub-Saharan Africa is
its large size, which allows analyses of outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
children, adolescents and pregnant and postpartum women, across diverse
settings.

•

The data reflect routine care across a wide range of real-world settings during the
scale up of ART in sub-Saharan Africa and thus provide a valuable platform to
conduct operational and clinical research and to study temporal trends and the
impact of changes in guidelines and other interventions.

•

The development of a standardised Data Exchange Standard protocol has
contributed to increase data quality, and data have been enriched by linkage to
cancer registries, vital registries and administrative databases.

•

Collaborations with the World Health Organization, UNAIDS, the mathematical
modelling community and other consortia have ensured that the analyses of the
African IeDEA regions contributed substantially to global health policy and
decision making.

•

Weaknesses include the limitations inherent in secondary use of routine clinical
care data, with missing data, the lack of standardised follow-up visits, and
substantial loss to follow-up resulting in unknown outcome.

•

Additional challenges include the lack of population-based samples, including HIV
negative controls

or ART-naive comparison groups,

and the lack

of

measurements such as non-communicable disease risk factors and outcomes.
Dealing with risk factors that affect clinical decision making, and the need to
control for (time-dependent) confounding can also be challenging.
