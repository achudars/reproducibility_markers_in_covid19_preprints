Abstract
PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2 deficient breast and ovarian cancer,
but a growing body of pre-clinical evidence suggests the drug class holds therapeutic potential in other cancer
types, independent of BRCA1/2 status. Large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets offer the opportunity to develop
predictors of response to PARPi’s in many cancer types, expanding their potential clinical applicability.
Response to the PARPi olaparib was used to identify a multi-gene PARPi response signature in a large in vitro
dataset including multiple cancer types, such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung cancer, osteosarcoma and
Ewing sarcoma, using machine learning approaches. The signature was validated on multiple independent in
vitro datasets, also testing for response to another PARPi, rucaparib, as well as two clinical datasets using the
cisplatin response as a surrogate for PARPi response. Finally, integrative pharmacogenomic analysis was
performed to identify drugs which may be effective in PARPi resistant tumors. A PARPi response signature
was defined as the 50 most differentially transcribed genes between PARPi resistant and sensitive cell lines
from several different cancer types. Cross validated predictors generated with LASSO logistic regression using
the PARPi signature genes accurately predicted PARPi response in a training set of olaparib treated cell lines
(80-89%), an independent olaparib treated in vitro dataset (66-77%), and an independent rucaparib treated in
vitro dataset (80-87%). The PARPi signature also significantly predicted in vitro breast cancer response to
olaparib in another separate experimental dataset. The signature also predicted clinical response to cisplatin and
survival in human ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma datasets. Robust transcriptional differences between PARPi
sensitive and resistant tumors accurately predict PARPi response in vitro and cisplatin response in vivo for
multiple tumor types with or without known BRCA1/2 deficiency. These signatures may prove useful for
predicting response in patients treated with PARP inhibitors.

Introduction
Genome fidelity is essential for the survival of cells and organisms. In addition to the intrinsic proofreading
exonuclease activities of the DNA polymerase and replication complexes, eukaryotic cells have evolved
elaborate error correction pathways able to repair both single and double strand damages [1]. Germline or
somatic mutations in the genes involved in DNA repair pathways, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, are frequently
observed in cancer cells [2]. Cells with defects in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathways, which impair double strand
break (DSB) repair, rely on single strand repair pathways, such as base excision repair pathway (BER), to
correct frequently occurring DNA damage.
The poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) protein family, which includes PARP1 and PARP2, are a vital
component of BER pathway [3],[4]. In addition to its role in BER repair, PARP1 also participates in DSB repair
via activation of ATM, a protein necessary for homologous recombination (HR) repair [5]. PARP1 also
recognizes stalled replication forks and recruits protein to begin HR repair [6]. These functions make the PARP
family an appealing target in cancer cells, especially those exhibiting mutations in double strand repair pathway
[7].
Cancer cells with BRCA and other homologous recombination pathway mutations are exquisitely sensitive to
PARP inhibitors [8],[9], and patients with ovarian cancer [10], breast cancer [11], [12], pancreatic cancer [13],
and prostate cancer [14] with germline BRCA mutations have improved progression-free survival on these
medications [15]. Though germline and somatic BRCA mutation patients derive the most benefit from these
drugs, in clinical trials, the survival advantage of PARP inhibitors also extends to a subset of wild type BRCA
tumors [16], which are often HR deficient by other means such as PALB2 mutation or BRCA promoter
methylation. Moreover, emerging cell line and early-stage clinical trial data indicate that PARP inhibition might
offer clinical benefits in cancers not typically associated with BRCA mutations, for example, in prostate, lung,
Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and BRCA wild type breast cancer. Thus, there is a need to develop tumor
subtype agnostic biomarkers which reliably predict clinical response to PARP inhibitors.
We, therefore, set out to develop a PARP response signature using gene expression data from a very large
collection of cell lines treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib, the first such drug that entered clinical
development [17]. We developed a predictor using machine learning algorithms and validated it on independent
groups of cell lines treated with both olaparib and rucaparib. The model’s predictive value was further
independently validated in three additional data sets, two of which were clinical, using cisplatin response as a
surrogate. Further biologic and therapeutic implications of our findings are discussed.

Results
Highly predictive gene signature for PARP inhibitor response
We asked if the in-vitro sensitivity to olaparib and rucaparib (previously called AG-014699) of tumor cell lines
from a wide range of tissue subtypes previously reported in a large pharmacogenomic study [18] is also
associated with transcription patterns, which could then be used as markers for PARP inhibitor response
prediction across many different tissue subtypes. We also explored if we could develop a multi-gene panel
predictive of PARP responsiveness in patient tumors and cells lines without any discernible genetic hallmarks
of BRCA gene or related pathway deregulation.
To minimize both technical laboratory artifact effects and also to pursue “drug class” as opposed to drug
specific findings, we performed our analysis only in the large subset of cell lines, (n=143) that showed
concordant sensitivity or resistance to the two drugs (Supplementary Table 1). We first identified differentially
expressed genes in a subset of cell lines treated with olaparib. Due to the large number of statistically
significantly differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table 2), we selected the top 50 genes and used
their expression levels to classify in-vitro response of cell lines to PARP inhibitors. For a training set, we
randomly selected two thirds of the cell lines treated with olaparib, and one third was used for initial validation.

The model derived from the training set was then applied to cell lines treated with rucaparib for another
independent testing. On 3-fold cross validation LASSO-logistic regression, prediction accuracies with various
subsets of the 50 genes ranged from 80-89% for the training set, 66-77% for the olaparib-treated independent
cell lines and 80-87% for the rucaparib treated independent data set. An example of a high performing logistic
regression-based prediction model is shown in Table 1.

On inspection of classification accuracies, we found our prediction algorithm worked very well for certain
tissue subtypes, such as ovarian, and breast cancer cells, which were classified with 100% accuracy. That said,
the signature also showed 100% cross validated prediction accuracy in osteosarcoma cancer cell lines and 71%
and 84% for Ewing’s and the lung cancer cell lines, respectively, observations that are interesting given the lack
of any clear knowledge for genetic perturbations of the HR pathway in any significant subsets of these tumors.
We noted that there is substantial heterogeneity in PARP inhibitor drug response between the different tissue
types included in the Garnett dataset, with some cell types showing extreme rates of resistance or sensitivity
(approaching 100%), and others showing a more “balanced” split in terms of the fraction of sensitive or
resistant cell lines. Therefore, we considered the possibility that this type of “tissue bias” might mean that the
gene expression differences and model predictions may reflect to a large extent differences between the
different histologic cancer types as opposed to a true PARPi resistance phenotype. To answer this question, we
assessed the classification accuracy excluding any cell lines from tissue types that showed above 80% resistance
or sensitivity to either of the two drugs (Supplementary Table 1). We observed that the prediction accuracy in
the remaining cell lines (n = 111) was similar, 80-89%, 68-77%, and 79-86% for the training, independent
olaparib and the independent rucaparib treated datasets, respectively.
We then asked if a published ovarian cancer “BRCAness” signature [19], that was previously shown by our
group to predict response to PARP inhibitors in ovarian tumors that did not harbor BRCA mutations, could also
be applied broadly to the multiple different tissue subtypes included in the current analysis. The “BRCAness”
signature, when used for hierarchical clustering [20] of the cell lines, showed a significant association with invitro response to PARP inhibitors (Fisher’s exact test p-value: < 0.05; odds ratio (OR): 2.1 - 3.9). However, a 3fold cross-validated LASSO logistic regression prediction model showed accuracies only in the range of 56 72%. This suggests that this “BRCAness” signature, while associated with defects in the DNA repair pathway
in tumors that do not harbor BRCA mutations, does not fully capture the biology that determines response to

PARP inhibitors in different tissue subtypes, underscoring the possible new insights offered by our current
analysis.
Finally, we applied the PARPi response signature on an entirely separate public dataset from a different study
[21] of gene expression profiles of 9 breast cancer cell lines treated with olaparib. Hierarchical clustering using
PARP inhibitor response gene lists ranging from 2 to 49 genes from our signature distinguished between the
relatively resistant and sensitive cell lines in this external dataset (OR ≥ 4.0; P = 0.008 - 0.048; Figure 1A).
Least angle regression (LARS) models significantly predicted each cell line’s response to olaparib. A
representative model is shown in Figure 1B (8 gene model, 0% deviation from minimal error allowed, R2 =
0.77).
Assessment of individualized prediction accuracy via ROC analysis.
Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis is the gold standard for assessing predictive power of a given
biomarker on a continuous variable scale. Thus, we performed ROC analysis in the independent validation set
of 143 cell lines treated with rucaparib. The 22-gene predictor model presented above in Table 1, achieved an
AUC = 0.919 (95% CI: 0.87 - 0.97, p < 0.001, Figure 2). Various models including subsets of 14 - 50 genes all
performed similarly with statistically significant AUC values 0.88 - 0.90.
PARP response signature is associated with clinical chemo response and recurrence in ovarian cancer
To test if the PARP response signature identified in vitro could be used to determine the in-vivo tumor
sensitivity, we selected 456 cases of ovarian cancer treated with cisplatin from The Cancer Genome Atlas
network dataset [22]. Given the lack of tumor derived molecular data from patients treated with PARP
inhibitors to date, cisplatin response was analyzed as a surrogate for sensitivity to agents targeting DNA repair
pathways [19], and specifically PARPi’s. A 3-fold cross-validated LASSO-logistic regression models
constructed iteratively with 25 - 50 gene subsets yielded accuracies of approximately 68%, in a training set
including 2/3 of the cases, while predictions in the independent sample set including the remaining 1/3 of
samples ranged between 70 - 74%. Genes from the optimal cisplatin prediction model in the ovarian cancer data
are seen in Table 2. In order to account for possible overfitting confounding these findings we also performed
unspervised hierarchical clustering and found a significant association between PARPi response signature
derived cluster groups and clinical response in the TCGA samples (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.038 - 0.076, OR =
1.46 - 1.60) (Figure 3), further indicating that the PARPi response profiles do carry biologic relevance to
cisplatin response in a clinical cohort.

We further found that the PARP inhibitor response signature not only predicted in-vivo response of the tumor to
cisplatin, but was also associated with recurrence free survival in the ovarian cancer clinical data. We examined
the iteratively generated cluster groups described above, based on unsupervised hierarchical clustering with
several parsed subsets of the 50 differentially expressed mRNAs, and found that they also represented two

groups with different recurrence free survival risk. For example, Figure 4 shows Recurrence Free Survival
results based on a 40-gene derived sample clustering, (Log-rank P < 0.001; Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.75; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.30 - 2.27; Median RFS: 551 months vs. 843 months); and a 14-gene derived
clustering (Log-rank P = 0.006; HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.11 - 1.87; Median RFS: 552 months vs. 680 months;).
Supervised models using the same gene lists also predicted groups with recurrence free survival that was very
close to nominal signifiance (14 gene model, Log-rank P = 0.060; Permutation P = 0.17; HR: 1.275; 95% CI:
0.990 - 1.643; Medan RFS: 582 months vs. 646 months; Figure 4). PARP response genes with the strongest
univariate association with RFS are shown in Table 3.

PARP response signature is associated with clinical chemoresponse and recurrence in osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is one of the most recalcitrant cancers with five-year survival rates for recurrent and metastatic
cases below 30% and inadequate response to chemotherapy beyond first line. Because of the unexpected
response to PARP inhibitors also observed in a subset of osteosarcoma cell lines (Supplementary Table 3), we
tested if the PARP inhibitor response signature we identified using the gene expression of cell lines exposed to
olaparib could be useful in the clinical setting. For this, we used gene expression data that we previously
published from a human cohort of 33 primary osteosarcoma samples [23]. As we did in the ovarian cancer
analysis, and given that cisplatin is part of the standard first line treatment in osteosarcoma, we also used
cisplatin response as a surrogate for PARP inhibitor response.
We first mapped our signature probe sets (which was generated on the Affymetrix platform) to the Illumina
DASL platform which was used in the previous human osteosarcoma gene expression study and found that 46
of the 50 genes could be mapped.
The low sample size of the osteosarcoma clinical cohort and differences in microarray platforms, presented
special challenges for this analysis. Despite these limitations we did find evidence that the PARP inhibitor
signature was associated with chemoresponse assessed by cisplatin induced tumor percent necrosis in the
osteosarcoma cohort. Among the signature genes, in univariate logistic regression analysis COX11, EDNRA,
and LDB2 were significantly associated with percent tumor necrosis (P = 0.033, 0.080, 0.067, ORs: 1.89, 2.41,
2.11 respectively, > 90% vs < 90%), while COX11, RUFY1, and LDB2 were significantly associated with
tumor percent necrosis (Pearson: 0.338, 0.356, -0.405; P = 0.055, 0.042, 0.02, respectively). LASSO logistic
regression prediction models (LOO cross-validated) using from 2 to 50 PARP response genes predicted clinical
response to cisplatin with accuracies ranging 61-73%. Further, 7 mRNAs from the PARP inhibitor response
signature were found to be associated with RFS by standard univariate Cox proportional hazards models with a
significant or trending p value (P < 0.15; Table 4). Finally, unsupervised hierarchical clustering based iteratively
on 10-30 PARP response signature gene subsets demonstrated differences in recurrence free survival (for
example, 30 genes: median RFS: 14 months versus 151 months, HR = 6.34, 95% CI: 2.00-20.53, log-rank P <
0.001, Figure 5A; 10 genes: median RFS: 34 months versus not-yet-reached, HR = 2.09, 95% CI: 0.76-5.75,
log-rank P = 0.003, Figure 5B). Given the substantial technical differences between the datasets and the small
sample size of the osteosarcoma cohort, we find these results supportive of the general hypothesis that the
PARP response signature may be clinically applicable in osteosarcoma too.

Gene Set Enrichment analysis demonstrates critical biologic processes and pathways differentially
regulated in the PARP resistant versus sensitive phenotype.
The substantial global differences in transcription between PARPi sensitive and resistant cell lines prompted us
to investigate if specific functional pathways are implicated in PARPi response. We performed Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis and identified many pathways differentially regulated by virtue of coordinated/aggregated
differences of the pathway gene sets between cell lines sensitive or resistant to olaparib and rucaparib (LS and
KS p < 0.05) (Table 5 and Supplementary Table 4). This analysis was performed using the global expression
data filtered only by 20% for low variance genes (analysis with 10% filter and no filter produced very similar
results). Predefined signatures of oncogenic pathway activation associated with PARPi response included
pathways which may be therapeutically targetable, such as MEK and mTOR, among others. Expression of
genes located on the largest non-coding cluster in the human genome, 14q32, were found to be significantly
different between PARPi resistant and sensitive cell lines. Transcription and epigenetic modification of this
locus has been shown to predict outcome in various cancer type by our group and others [23],[24],[25]. This
finding is supported by differential expression of the gene target set of miR-299, a microRNA that is also
located on 14q32
Table 5. Gene Set Analysis. Gene sets with LS and KS permutation p < 0.05 when analyzed in both the
olaparib and rucaparib datasets were considered enriched. The sign of the Efron – Tibshirani maxmean statistic
indicates if the geneset is over (+) or under (-) expressed in PARPi sensitive cell lines. In the large majority of
gene sets, the direction of differential regulation was concordant between the olaparib and rucaparib treated cell
lines, with only a few exceptions, in which case a sign is not listed.

Pharmacogenomics analysis to identify drugs that can potentially reverse PARP inhibitor resistance.
Heterogeneity of PARPi response in the cell line data prompted us to use the molecular response signature to
discover pharmaceuticals which may hold therapeutic potential in PARPi resistant tumors. We used the recently
described PharmacoGx [26] analytical tool via the PharmacoDB [27] interface to analyze PARPi response
across multiple large scale pharmacogenomic datasets. First, the entire set of drug interactions with the PARP

response signature genes in all cell lines contained in the database was used to prioritize drugs with a highly
significant (p < 0.001) interaction and reasonably large effect size (regression coefficient > |0.25|), returning a
list of 35 drugs. We then compared the in vitro sensitivity of these 35 drugs to olaparib and rucaparib in five
cancer types postulated to be at least partly sensitive to PARPi’s (breast, lung, ovarian, Ewing’s sarcoma, and
osteosarcoma) by obtaining drug sensitivity measures for all available cell lines derived from the five cancer
types. The cell lines were then ranked by their median IC50 value for olaparib and rucaparib, and the first and
fourth quartiles of cell lines were labelled as clearly sensitive and clearly resistant. For the 35 drugs the median
IC50 across resistant cell lines of each cancer type was obtained, and the 21 drugs with a median IC50 less than
10 µM for resistant cell lines of one or more cancer types are presented in Table 6. It was noteworthy that six of
these drugs inhibit key enzymes in the oncogenic signatures identified in the genset enrichment analysis (Table
5, above), and four have been shown by others to synergize with PARPi’s in vitro (afatinib [28], crizotinib [29],
erlotinib [30], and trametinib [31]) suggesting this proof of principle analysis identifies drugs which should be
further investigated for the treatment of PARPi resistant tumors. Additionally, using a slightly relaxed effect
size filter (regression coefficient > |0.15|) and same stringent significance cut off (p < 0.001) we found that
enzastaurin, a PKCβ inhibitor previously reported to synergize with PARPi’s [32], was also identified for

Novel drug candidates with strong statistically significant predictive interaction with the PARP response
signature (43 unique genes) are shown together with experimentally derived IC50 (µM) values for 1) all and 2)
resistant cell lines from each tissue type. Fold change (FC) reflects a ratio of the IC50 of the more potent of the
two PARPi drugs, and the respective novel candidate drug in PARPi resistant cell lines. Pan-cancer analysis
was performed with the five cancers. Green denotes an IC50 < 1 µM, and blue denotes an IC50 < 10 µM. Data
was not available for all combinations of drugs and cell lines. Bolded drugs have been reported to synergize
with PARPi’s in the literature, italicized drugs target a pathway identified in the GSE analysis in Table 5.

Discussion
PARP inhibitors have significantly improved progression-free and overall survival for patients with BRCA
positive ovarian [10] and breast cancer [11], [12]. The clinical benefit, however, is not restricted to patients with
BRCA mutation mediated HR deficiency and in clinical trials, the survival advantage is also observed in
patients with wild type BRCA genes [33], [34]. Moreover, in vitro studies indicate that PARP inhibitors have
broad activity, extending beyond clinically approved indications in BRCA mutated ovarian and breast cancer
patients [16]. In this study, we therefore investigated if a gene expression signature could be used to predict the
clinical response of PARP inhibitors in both cancer cell lines and patients.
Based on the expression profile of a subset of marker genes from cell lines treated with olaparib, we were able
to predict with high accuracy response of an independent PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, as well resistance and
sensitivity of cell lines from a completely independent study. Furthermore, the model outperformed our
previously published “BRCAness” signature when tested on multiple different cell lines, indicating that the
signature identified in this study is not restricted to the pathways captured by the BRCAness signature.
The signature also predicted with high accuracies the clinical response of patients treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy, which was used as a surrogate for PARP inhibitor response, in patients with ovarian cancer and
osteosarcoma. This indicates that the gene expression profile covers not only the broad biology underlying the
PARP inhibitor response but also suggests that such an approach could be used on patient-derived samples.
There are, at the moment, no available clinical data that would enable us to confirm how well the model would
perform when actual patients are on PARP inhibitors. However, since the clinical decision to start PARP
inhibitor in ovarian cancer is made when the patient is either on or has just completed platinum-based
chemotherapy, this might more closely approximate current clinical practice than a pure predictor for PARP
inhibitor response. That said, the predictive performance of such a signature should ultimately be tested in
patients only treated with a PARP inhibitor as well.
Given that the clinical utility of PARP is now being tested across cancers without known HRD we suggest that
such a predictive model would be essential to identify the subgroup of patients who might benefit from the
PARP inhibitors, especially in cancers where the clinical benefit is most likely to be restricted a subset of
patients. Our results indicate that cancer subsets that were previously thought not to be susceptible to PARP
inhibitors may still benefit from treatment with these drugs with careful selection of patients based on tumor
expression profile. The data from our study show that the response predictive gene list is highly reproducible in
various independent cancer data sets, including subsets that were previously thought to be unsusceptible to
PARP inhibitors.
Our results also demonstrate the value of principled and sophisticated analysis of large genomic and drug
response datasets such as the CCLE [35], [36] and the GDSC [18], [37], [38]. While some concerns were
previously raised about some aspects of technical reproducibility of these drug response screening efforts [39],
[40], our study demonstrates that despite those potential issues, these datasets, when analyzed carefully and with
adequate steps to minimize artifacts and noise, can be very valuable in the effort to reveal new therapeutic
applications and develop response predictors. In this context, another study recently utilized expression and
drug response data successfully develop and test a PARP inhibitor predictor [32]. That report utilized a different
set of gene expression data from our study (CCLE vs GDSC) and employed different analytical algorithms and
somewhat different definitions of response vs non-response. Likely due to all these differences in study
approach, only a few of the top marker genes overlapped with the multi gene signature we describe here.
However, both studies converge on similar overall conclusions on the power of gene profiles to predict response
to PARP inhibitors and aid in developing novel therapies for PARP inhibitor resistance. As has been the case
for other phenotypes (such as breast cancer prognostic microarray signatures), it is possible that the different
marker panels reflect different aspects of the same biological phenotype which is characterized of a large
number of differentially expressed genes, as shown in our analysis too.

Our pharmacogenomic bioinformatic analysis of these large transcriptional differences between cell lines
sensitive and resistant to PARPi’s revealed drugs which may have a rationale for synergy with PARPi’s.
Furthere, this analysis identified four drugs for which pre-clinical evidence of synergistic interactions with
PARPi’s already exists, namely afatinib [28], crizotinib [29], erlotinib [30], and trametinib [31]. This suggests
the drugs from our analysis are candidates for further study, particularly in the subset of patients predicted to be
unresponsive to PARPi therapy by the PARP response signature. Clinical trials often reveal that only a subset of
patients respond to treatment with novel molecularly driven therapies, and recent PARPi studies in Ewing
sarcoma underscore this point [41]. In this context, expression read outs, such as the signature presented in this
study, can potentially become useful clinical markers to prioritize these new treatments to a subset of patients
more likely to respond, and may be used to also identify drugs with possible synergy for further testing in the
clinical setting.
Techniques used to detect homologous recombination deficits, such as RAD51 foci formation assays and
genomic scar scoring, have been proposed as possible tools to predict response to PARPi’s [42]. Despite their
proposed utility, RAD51 foci detection can only be performed in tumors after exposure to DNA damaging
agents, or ex vivo DNA damage, and genomic scar biomarkers have so far been limited by a low positive
predictive value [43]. Further work should be conducted to determine if these methods can complement a
transcription-based assay of PARPi response, which has the additional advantage that it can be performed prior
to the decision to treat with the drugs.
Multi-gene predictors, such as the one developed in this study, need further refinement and validation, and
future prospective studies are required to confirm the clinical utility of a predictive model. With the wide
availability of RNA sequencing, we think a predictive model based on RNA expression, in conjunction with
DNA sequencing approaches, would be feasible for future clinical trials and would help extend the utility of
PARP inhibitors to an expanding array of patient subgroups in many different types of cancers.

Methods
In vitro PARP inhibitor response
Cell line drug response and transcription data used to generate the PARPi response signature was obtained from
the GDSC [37] dataset https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads. The median IC50 of olaparib and rucaparib
across all cell lines tested in the dataset was used to classify each cell line as sensitive or resistant to olaparib
and rucaparib, separately. To minimize technical artifacts and prioritize the drug class as opposed to specific
compound effect, cell lines were required to be classified concordantly for olaparib and rucaparib response in
order to be included in the analysis. An independent gene transcription dataset of breast cancer cell lines treated
with olaparib was obtained from a previously published study [21], which was used as entirely independent in
vitro dataset to validate the PARPi response signature.
Human ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma gene expression datasets
Clinical and gene expression data for 456 ovarian cancer cases treated with cisplatin were obtained from The
Cancer Genome Atlas data portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) [22]. We previously generated the clinically
annotated osteosarcoma expression profiling dataset [23], which is accessible through GEO Series accession
number GSE39055.
Unsupervised hierarchal clustering and standard univariate tests.
Differential analysis (class comparison) between two groups of samples was performed by a permutation-based
t-test with standard False Discovery Correction for multiple testing [44]. Positional genesets, miRNA target
genesets, and oncogenic signature genesets were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database
(http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb). BioCarta genesets were downloaded via the Cancer Genome
Anatomy Project (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways) and KEGG pathways via the KEGG.db R package
(http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/KEGG.db.html). Unsupervised hierarchal

clustering [20] was performed with the centered correlation and average linkage method. Associations between
two categorical variables were evaluated with two-tailed chi-square/Fisher’s exact test. Cluster-based group
associations with survival were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log rank test for significance.
Pearson’s r statistic was used to evaluate continuous variable correlations.
Response/Survival prediction and ROC analysis
Binary prediction accuracy of the PARP inhibitor signature (sensitive / resistant) was predicted using a 3-fold or
leave one out cross validated logistic lasso regression [45] and continuous response prediction was performed
with least angle regression (LARS) [46] as previously described. The supervised principal components survival
prediction method was used to generate models for patient survival and perform leave-one-out cross validated
performance assessment [47]. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC)
analysis was performed per standard methodology using a continuous response probability index generated by a
Bayesian compound covariate prediction algorithm [48].
Geneset enrichment analysis
Geneset enrichment analysis [49] for the association of global expression profiles (filtered for the lowest 20%
variance genes) with PARP inhibitor sensitivity was performed with the functional class scoring method [50]
applying the LS/KS test with a permutation p value less than 0.05 by both tests used to identify genesets with
enriched differential expression. Positional genesets, miRNA target genesets, and oncogenic signature genesets
were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb).
BioCarta pathway genesets were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project
(http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways) and KEGG pathways were obtained using the KEGG.db R package
(http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/KEGG.db.html).
Integrative pharmacogenomic analysis
The 50 gene PARP inhibitor response signature was analyzed for drug interaction discovery using the
PharmacoGx [26] R package through the PharmacoDB [27] interface. Specifically, 43 unique genes comprising
the signature were individually tested for association with drug response across seven large datasets using
stringent selection criteria for effect size (regression coefficient > |0.25|) and significance (two-sided t-test p <
0.001) resulting in 35 drugs with at least one significant interaction with a gene from the PARPi response
signature. Whenever we tested a drug hypothesis derived by previously published data, external to this analysis,
we used a slightly less restrictive, but still stringent selection criteria for effect size (regression coefficient >
|0.15|) with the same significance cut off (two-sided t-test p < 0.001).
In vitro drug sensitivity metrics were then obtained for the 35 drugs with cell lines corresponding to the five
tissue types of interest; namely breast (87 cell lines), lung (221 cell lines), ovarian (64 cell lines), osteosarcoma
(15 cell lines), and Ewing’s sarcoma (25 cell lines). We elected to use the median IC50 for groups of cell lines
in order to avoid outlier effects. First, the median IC50 dose response metric was calculated for each drug across
the cell lines to obtain a “pan-cancer” IC50 value for each drug. Median IC50 values for each of the five cancer
types were then calculated separately to observe tissue-type specific drug interactions. To identify cell lines
resistant and sensitive to the PARP inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib in the PharmacoDB database, median
IC50’s for olaparib and rucaparib were obtained for the subset of cell lines for which drug response data was
available. For each cell line, the median response to both olaparib and rucaparib was calculated. Cell lines were
ranked by the median IC50 response, and the 1st and 4th quartiles of the list were used to define sensitive and
resistant cell lines, respectively. Within the separate sensitive and resistant cell line groups, median IC50 values
for each drug were calculated. As a final filtering step, only drugs with a median IC50 less than 10 µM in at
least one tissue type’s subset of PARPi resistant cell lines were included in our final list of 21 drugs.
Statistical Software
The NCI BRB-ArrayTools v4.6.0 [51], R (version 3.4.3), and SPSS v 24 software were used.

Figure 1. A): Hierarchical clustering and Heat map with the 50 PARP inhibitor response signature transcripts in
an independent breast cancer cell line dataset separate from the GCSD dataset shows good discrimination
between resistant (R) and sensitive (S) cell lines (Fisher’s p = 0.048). Separation was even more significant with
smaller gene subsets. B): LARS regression response prediction for individual cell lines with an 8 gene subset of
PARP inhibitor response genes in the same breast cancer cell line dataset.
