Abstract

26

Background: Synchronized circadian rhythms play a key role in coordinating

27

physiologic health. Desynchronized circadian rhythms may predispose

28

individuals to disease or be indicative of underlying disease. Intensive care unit

29

(ICU) patients likely experience desynchronized circadian rhythms due to

30

disruptive environmental conditions in the ICU and underlying pathophysiology.

31

This observational pilot study was undertaken to determine if circadian rhythms

32

are altered in ICU patients relative to healthy controls by profiling circadian

33

rhythms in vital signs and plasma metabolites.

34

Methods: We monitored circadian rhythms in 5 healthy controls and 5 ICU

35

patients for 24 hours. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured every 30

36

minutes, temperature was measured every hour, and blood was sampled for

37

mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics every 4 hours. Bedside sound

38

levels were measured every minute. Circadian rhythms were evaluated in vitals

39

and plasma metabolites individually and in each group using the cosinor method.

40

Results: ICU patient rooms were significantly louder than healthy controls’

41

rooms and average noise levels were above EPA recommendations. Healthy

42

controls generally had significant circadian rhythms individually and as a group.

43

While a few ICU patients had significant circadian rhythms in isolated variables,

44

no significant rhythms were identified in ICU patients as a group, except in

45

cortisol. This indicates a lack of coherence in circadian phases and amplitudes

46

among ICU patients. Finally, principal component analysis of metabolic profiles

47

showed surprising patterns in plasma sample clustering. Each ICU patient’s

48

samples were clearly discernable in individual clusters, separate from a single

49

cluster of healthy controls.

50

Conclusions: ICU patients’ circadian rhythms show significant

51

desynchronization compared to healthy controls. Clustering of plasma metabolic

52

profiles suggests that metabolomics could be used to track individual patients’

53

clinical courses longitudinally. Our results show global disordering of metabolism

54

and the circadian system in ICU patients which should be characterized further in

55

order to determine implications for patient care.

Introduction

59
60

Circadian rhythms span multiple levels of hierarchical organization in biological

61

systems, through molecular processes (peripheral oscillators) to whole-body

62

rhythms such as core body temperature (1). Synchronized, intact rhythms are

63

fundamental to human health and their desynchronization is now known to

64

contribute to morbidity and pathophysiology in otherwise healthy individuals (2-

65

4). Critical care physicians increasingly recognize the influence of circadian

66

desynchronization on physiology and outcomes in critically ill patients (5, 6).

67

There is clear evidence that supporting circadian rhythms in cancer patients

68

contributes to higher quality of life (7). Likewise, it may be beneficial to support

69

circadian rhythms in intensive care unit (ICU) patients (8, 9).

70

While there is evidence that circadian rhythms are disrupted in the

71

critically ill, the etiology is complex and multifaceted (10). A host of

72

desynchronizing influences are present in critical illness, including poor sleep

73

(11), continuously-administered parenteral nutrition (12-14), unregulated

74

light/dark cycles and sound levels (15-17), as well as the influence of

75

pharmacological treatments (18).

76

Due to the hierarchical and widely distributed organization of the circadian

77

system, multiple data types should be collected to determine the extent of

78

circadian desynchronization in critical illness regardless of the underlying cause.

79

High-throughput –omics data, particularly metabolomics, is suited to this

80

endeavor, since metabolism is tightly coupled to the core clock mechanism (19-

21). Multiple circadian metabolites have been reported in the literature, identified

82

with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics (22-24) and alterations to circadian

83

rhythms in the metabolome have been documented in shift work (25) and sleep

84

disruption protocols (26).

85

We collected preliminary data to evaluate the extent of circadian

86

desynchronization in ICU patients using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics

87

in this observational study. Secondary objectives were to evaluate circadian

88

desynchronization in vital signs and to measure sound levels in patient rooms.

89

We hypothesized that disruptions to circadian rhythms in ICU patients relative to

90

healthy controls would be identified in multiple metabolites and in vital signs. To

91

test this hypothesis, we conducted a pilot study in 5 healthy controls and 5 ICU

92

patients. This study is the first to use metabolomics to profile circadian rhythms in

93

the critically ill.

94
95

Methods

96
97

The study protocol (study number 1505M70361) was reviewed and approved by

98

the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board in accordance with the

99

Code of Federal Regulations, 45 CFR 46.101(b). All enrolled healthy participants

100

gave their informed consent to study staff. Informed consent was obtained from

101

legally authorized representatives of all enrolled ICU patients since they were

102

sedated and unable to consent.

105

Patient population:
From 2015-2016, circadian rhythms were monitored in 5 healthy control

106

participants and 5 intensive care unit (ICU) patients for 24 hours. Healthy

107

participants were over 18 years of age with a self-reported average of 7-8 hours

108

of sleep a night, and were in generally good health. They were screened to

109

exclude the following factors that may affect normal circadian rhythms: shift work,

110

blindness, use of over-the-counter sleep aids or supplements, history of

111

traumatic brain injury, brain surgery, or sleep apnea, smoking, use of

112

psychotropic drugs, or current alcohol use of more than 2 drinks per day. Healthy

113

participants were monitored by trained staff at the University of Minnesota’s

114

Masonic Clinical Research Unit. Catheters were placed peripherally to facilitate

115

blood draws. They were not subjected to constant routine conditions. They

116

stayed in single rooms with windows allowing natural light. They were provided

117

meals from a cafeteria at times of their choosing that generally corresponded to

118

set mealtimes, controlled the room’s light levels to their preference, and

119

determined their own periods of rest and activity. All 5 participants reported that

120

they slept well despite nighttime monitoring.

121

ICU patients were recruited from the University of Minnesota Medical

122

Center ICU according to the following criteria: age > 18 years, mechanical

123

ventilation with sedation for at least 3 days, and any of the following: emergent

124

surgery, emergent intubation, admission after severe trauma, damage control

125

surgery, or admission to ICU for post-operative complication. Patients with these

126

conditions were excluded: severe nervous system disorder such as traumatic

127

brain injury or recent neurosurgery, confirmed or suspected drug overdose or

128

alcohol abuse, blindness, severe renal failure, end stage liver disease or hepatic

129

encephalopathy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use, required

130

vasopressors or steroids, central sleep apnea, hemoglobin levels ≤8 g/dL, and

131

dementia or delirium prior to ICU stay. All ICU patients were fed enterally.

132

Twelve participants were enrolled in the study. One healthy control was

133

disqualified because of abnormally high blood pressure. One ICU patient was

134

extubated during the study and disqualified.

135
136

Data collection:

137

In all 10 research participants, beginning at 9:00 AM, heart rate and blood

138

pressure were measured every 30 minutes. Temperature was measured every

139

hour orally (healthy controls) or via Foley catheter (ICU patients). Bedside sound

140

levels were measured every minute (Bruel and Kjaer 2250L, Duluth, GA).

141

For the metabolomics portion of the study, blood samples (5 mL) were

142

drawn for metabolomics analysis every 4 hours beginning at 9:00 AM in each

143

participant. Plasma was extracted and aliquots were stored at -80°C until

144

preparation for analysis with mass spectrometry. Reagents were obtained from

145

Fisher Chemical Co., and were of LC-MS grade or better. Samples were

146

prepared according to published protocols (27, 28). Internal standards (see S1

147

Table) were added to thawed plasma samples followed by the addition of 4

148

volumes of cold (-80oC) 10% acetone 90% methanol (i.e. added 400µL solvent to

149

100µl sample). Samples were vortexed and incubated at -20oC for 15 minutes.

150

Samples were spun down at 13,000g for 10 minutes at 4 oC and the supernatant

151

transferred to a clean tube. The incubation and centrifugation were repeated and

152

the final supernatant transferred to a clean tube, which was then dried under

153

nitrogen. Preparation for reverse-phase LC-MS analysis was completed by

154

adding a starting buffer (100 µl of 5% acetonitrile, 95% water, 0.1% formic acid).

155

Sample pH was adjusted to approximately 2 by adding 10-20 µl of 10% formic

156

acid.

157

Samples were analyzed via chromatographic separation in-line with mass

158

spectrometry. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) was

159

performed using the Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000 UHPLC platform. For

160

reverse-phase analysis the instrument was fitted with a Waters Acquity BEH C-

161

18 column (2.1x100 mm, 1.7 µm particle size). Flow rate was 0.4 mL/minute and

162

the column compartment was set to 40oC. Ten microliters were injected onto the

163

column. Elution solutions were A) water with 0.1% formic acid and B) acetonitrile

164

with 0.1% formic acid. The elution gradient was as follows: 2% B for 0.5 minutes;

165

increase to 25% B over the next 0.5 minutes; increase to 80% B over the next 7

166

minutes; increase to 100% B for 2 minutes; decrease to 2% B over the next 0.5

167

minutes; hold at 2% B for 2.5 minutes.

168

The Q Exactive™ Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo

169

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was employed for mass analysis. The

170

instrument profiles for both high mass accuracy (<2 ppm) and spectral resolution

171

(typically at 70,000 resolution in full scan mode). Analysis was performed in

172

positive mode over a mass range of 70-1050 m/z.

Data analysis:
Evaluation of sound levels. Differences in bedside sound levels in

176

participants’ rooms were evaluated using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests with the R

177

software package v.3.3.3 (29). Sound meter data were discarded for three study

178

subjects (one healthy control and two ICU patients) due to technical failure.

179

There was very little variation in the sound levels recorded for the three

180

participants with flat noise levels (mean LAeq=49.0 dB, standard deviation=7.03

181

dB for analyzed participants; mean LAeq=25.7 dB, standard deviation=0.184 dB

182

for discarded participants).

183

Evaluation of 24-hour rhythms. Time series measurements of

184

each participant’s heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and plasma

185

metabolite intensities were evaluated for 24-hour rhythmicity using the cosinor

186

methodology (30) in individuals and at the population level. MESOR (midline

187

estimating statistic of rhythm or rhythm-adjusted mean), amplitude, and

188

acrophase were determined for each variable in each individual. Individual p-

189

values were combined in each group using the methodology described in Sokal

190

and Rohlf (31). Briefly, the test consists of computing

191

the number of p-values being combined (in this case, 5) and Pk are the individual

192

p-values. This quantity follows a chi-square distribution with 2k degrees of

193

freedom and a chi-square test is used to arrive at a final p-value indicative of

194

whether or not individuals in each group had a significant circadian rhythm. This

where k is

195

approach simplifies the evaluation and presentation of the individual rhythms,

196

otherwise 150 p-values would need to be presented.

197

Population means for each variable were evaluated and compared

198

between the two study groups using parameter tests for the population mean

199

cosinor (PMC) (30). Inference is done by (1) calculating the arithmetic mean of

200

individual MESORs and (2) calculating the average of individual

201

amplitude/acrophase pairs, treating the pairs as vectors. PMC p-values indicate

202

the statistical significance of the zero-amplitude test and reflect similar amplitude-

203

acrophase pairs among individuals in the population at the trial period considered

204

(i.e., 24 hours), irrespective of whether a circadian rhythm could be demonstrated

205

individually. Note that PMC can show a significant result when the combined p-

206

values do not because the PMC algorithm uses all the data at once, increasing

207

the statistical power over the individual calculations.

208

Mass spectrometry metabolomics: Plasma metabolites were

209

putatively identified with the Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC)

210

and Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) software packages in

211

conjunction with the Metlin (32) and HMDB (33) databases and an in-house

212

database compiled by the facility performing the spectrometry. A group of 60

213

previously identified circadian metabolites were targeted (24, 34). Principal

214

component analysis of all features identified with Progenesis QI was performed

215

using the R software package after intensities were log-transformed (29).

216

Features were filtered using the ANOVA algorithm in Progenesis (q-

217

value<0.05) when comparing ICU patients to healthy controls (35). Filtering

resulted in a list of 15,000 identified features distinguishing ICU patients from

219

healthy controls. This reduced dataset was linked with HMDB identifiers by

220

Progenesis QI and exported directly to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN

221

Inc.,

222

https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis/). IPA

223

was able to map 12,825 of these HMDB IDs to its database. For features that

224

matched more than one HMDB identity, IPA resolves duplicates by choosing the

225

feature with the lowest p-value. Following the resolution of duplicates, the

226

resulting dataset of 2,696 metabolites with HMDB IDs was used by IPA in the

227

pathway analysis.

Sound levels were significantly higher in ICU patients’ rooms than in

healthy controls’ rooms, particularly at night (Fig 1). Average minimum equivalent

continuous noise levels (LAeq) were 48 dB (ICU) vs. 33 dB (controls; p<0.0001).

250

Sound levels in ICU patient rooms were, on average, above recommended World

251

Health Organization limits of 35 dB (36). In two of the patients’ rooms, the

252

minimum sound levels were quite loud: 43.5 and 54.9 dB, respectively. Mean

253

noise levels overlapped in ICU patient rooms and healthy controls’ rooms from

254

9:00 to 13:30 and again at 9:00 the following morning. Noise levels remained

255

elevated in ICU patients’ rooms even during nighttime hours while healthy

256

controls had a clear decrease in sound levels at night, particularly around

midnight. We noted a clear lack of a 24-hour pattern in ICU noise levels relative

significant rhythms in vitals at both the individual and population levels in healthy

Combined individual p-values, number of rhythmic features, and population mean

281

cosinor (PMC) p-values for circadian variables monitored in this study. A total of

282

29 rhythmic features were observed in healthy controls, and 14 in ICU patients.

283

HEA=Healthy Controls; ICU=ICU patients.

284
285

As a group, healthy controls had a significant (PMC p<0.007) 24-hour

286

rhythm in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, and near-significant (PMC

287

p<0.091) rhythms in temperature and systolic blood pressure (Fig 2 and Table 2).

288

As a group, ICU patients had no significant 24-hour rhythms in the same

289

variables, even though some patients had a significant rhythm at the individual

290

level. This indicates a lack of coherence in the acrophases and amplitudes of

291

ICU patients in these variables. This can also be seen in Table 3, which reports

292

24-hour rhythm characteristics (24-hour p-value, MESOR, amplitude, and

293

acrophase) determined by PMC. For ICU patients, 95% confidence limits could

294

not be computed for the majority of the variables measured.

24-hour rhythm characteristics of vital signs and putatively identified metabolites

quantified with mass spectrometry, quantified with PMC. MESOR is the midline

306

estimating statistic of rhythm, amplitude is the circadian amplitude, and

307

acrophase reflects the timing of overall high values recurring each day,

308

expressed in clock time. Confidence intervals for insignificant 24-hour rhythms

309

are reported as NS (not significant). Mass spectrometry features are uniquely

310

identified by retention time (RT) and mass to charge ratio (m/z) or neutral mass.

311
312

24-hour rhythms in the metabolome: Progenesis QI

313

identified 25,000 unique features. Sixty circadian metabolites were putatively

314

identified using retention times and mass-to-charge ratios published in the

315

literature (24, 34), online databases (METLIN, HMDB) and in-house lists curated

316

by the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics. Of these 60 metabolites,

317

PMC showed that 10 had a significant 24-hour rhythm in the healthy control

318

group (Table 3 and S3 and S4 Figs) and none had a significant rhythm in the ICU

319

group. For brevity, we present information only on the 10 significant metabolites.

320

Significant 24-hour rhythms were identified in cortisol both individually and

321

at the group level in healthy controls and in ICU patients (Laboratory value, Table

322

2). Even though PMC showed that both the ICU group and the healthy control

323

group had a significant 24-hour rhythm in cortisol, patients’ cortisol rhythms had

324

some abnormal features: they had a higher mean (20.5 vs. 6.9 g/dL, p=0.01)

325

than controls as well as scattered acrophases (Fig 3). Healthy controls had tightly

326

clustered acrophases (9:24 (8:36, 10:44)) while ICU patients did not (10:08

327

(6:04, 13:52); data are reported as acrophase (95% confidence interval)). The

328

scatter of phases in the ICU patient group leads to a significant lowering of

329

rhythm amplitude in the ICU patient group relative to the healthy control group as

330

quantified by PMC. (Cortisol was quantified by the hospital laboratory and with

331

mass spectrometry, showing good agreement in patterns (see S5 Fig)).

338

placed at each rhythm’s acrophase. Arrow lengths reflect rhythm amplitude.

339
340

For the 10 putatively identified rhythmic metabolites, some patterns were

341

evident in the data. For cortisone, Lyso PC 18.2, Lyso PE 18.1, Lyso PE 18.2,

342

and proline, rhythms exist both at the individual level and the group level in

343

healthy controls. Rhythms do not exist in ICU patients at either among individuals

344

or as a group, except proline has a rhythm at the individual level in ICU patients.

345

For acetylcarnitine, aminoadipate, tyramine, and 2-

346

hydroxylauroylcarnitine, neither patients nor controls have significant rhythms

347

when evaluated individually. We interpret this to mean that patients did not differ

348

much from healthy controls individually in these variables. However, PMC

showed the healthy control group had significant rhythms while ICU patient group

350

did not. This implies that among ICU patients, there was more variability among

351

individuals in amplitude, MESOR, and acrophase. Among healthy controls,

352

however, there was much less variability among individuals in 24-hour rhythm

353

characteristics.

355

Principal component analysis: To more globally assess

356

differences in metabolism between healthy controls and ICU patients, we

357

performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the mass spectrometry data. A

358

scores plot (Fig 4) of the features identified by Progenesis QI shows that each

359

ICU patient’s plasma samples (P07-P12) are strongly clustered together away

360

from healthy controls (P01-P06). Of the 5 ICU patients studied, 4 had ICU stays

361

of >20 days and 3 were discharged to long-term acute care facilities (Table 1).

362

The 5th patient had an 8-day stay and was discharged home. This patient’s

363

cortisol rhythm was closest to the rhythms of healthy controls (Fig 3) and their

364

metabolic profiles (red circles) closest to the cluster of healthy controls (Fig 4).

To reduce this dataset, features were evaluated for statistical significance

378

in Progenesis QI by comparing feature intensity in the ICU group vs. feature

379

intensity in the healthy control group. Features with ANOVA q<0.05 were

380

retained. This reduced the data set from 25,000 identified features to15,000

381

features. Since this is still a very large dataset, we explored it with Ingenuity

382

Pathway Analysis (IPA). The canonical pathway analysis showed 17 pathways

383

dysregulated in ICU patients relative to healthy controls at the level of p<0.05 (S6

384

385

biosynthesis, FXR/RXR activation, spermine biosynthesis, and spermidine

386

biosynthesis I. A striking 68 different diseases and functions were identified by

387

IPA at the level of p<0.05. The top 5 diseases identified were inflammatory

injury and abnormalities, and cell death and survival (S7 Table).

Discussion

392

In this pilot study of 5 ICU patients and 5 healthy controls, we postulated and

393

confirmed that patients’ 24-hour rhythms differ from those of healthy controls.

394

Rhythms were monitored in heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and

395

circulating plasma metabolites including cortisol. We hypothesized that fewer of
20

396

these variables would show significant 24-hour rhythms in the ICU patient group

397

than in the healthy control group. Our results support this hypothesis. Healthy

398

controls generally had significant 24-hour rhythms individually and as a group.

399

On the other hand, while a few ICU patients had significant 24-hour rhythms in

400

isolated variables, no significant rhythms were identified in ICU patients at the

401

group level, except in cortisol. This indicates a lack of coherence in rhythm

402

phases and amplitudes among ICU patients. The general lack of a significant

403

rhythm in ICU patients at the population level suggests that 24-hour rhythms are

404

synchronized in healthy controls only.

Sound levels: Noise levels were significantly louder in ICU patient

405
406

rooms than in healthy control rooms at all times, and remained elevated at night.

407

In contrast, healthy controls’ rooms had a clear decrease in nighttime noise

408

levels.

409

The World Health Organization recommends that patient care areas not

410

exceed 35 dB LAeq (36). In this study, we observed LAeq levels far above this

411

threshold in ICU patient rooms. Other groups have observed similar trends (15,

412

37, 38). It has been known for over 20 years that high noise levels are present in

413

the ICU and that they adversely affect sleep (15, 39, 40). There is a clear link

414

between sleep deprivation and delirium, which is related to poor outcomes in ICU

415

patients (11). Because of this link, protocols to improve sleep in the ICU have

416

been well-described (41, 42). However, these interventions do not explicitly

417

control sound levels, nor is it standard clinical practice to control light or sound

418

levels in the ICU. Simple interventions to control ICU light and sound levels and

419

foster sleep are promising, and show a reduction in the incidence of delirium

420

(43).

421

Though study limitations prevent us from reporting on light levels in study

422

participants’ rooms, it is worth commenting on since light is a strong synchronizer

423

of the circadian system. Interestingly, some groups have observed a lack of

424

bright light levels as well as a lack of 24-hour variation in light levels in ICU

425

patient rooms, which may contribute to circadian rhythm disruption in patients

426

(16, 17, 44). Protocols to enforce strict light-dark cycles with sufficient brightness

427

in ICU patient rooms during the day should be standard-of-care to help

428

synchronize patient circadian rhythms.

24-hour rhythms: Healthy controls had statistically significant or

429
430

near-significant 24-hour rhythm in heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature at

431

both the individual level and the population level. ICU patients did not have

432

significant 24-hour rhythms in any of the vitals measured. This finding reflects a

433

disruption to 24-hour rhythms in ICU patients, which other groups have noted (6,

434

45).

435

We made preliminary identifications of 60 circadian metabolites in the

436

plasma of study participants using mass spectrometry, 10 of which had a

437

significant 24-hour rhythm in the healthy control group. With the exception of

438

cortisol, none of these metabolites showed a significant rhythm in ICU patients at

439

the group level. Even though both ICU patients and healthy controls showed a

440

significant 24-hour rhythm in laboratory-quantified cortisol, we noted that patients’

441

cortisol rhythms showed abnormalities in phase and MESOR. Elevated cortisol

442

and disrupted cortisol metabolism are known to occur in critical illness (46, 47).

443

Interestingly, the ICU patient with the lowest APACHE II score has a cortisol

444

pattern that is very close to that of the healthy controls.

445

It is striking that even in this pilot study, profiled physiological indicators of

446

circadian rhythms showed a significant or near-significant rhythm in healthy

447

controls but not in ICU patients. The data identify a significant, global disruption

448

to the circadian rhythm in critical illness. The implications of this finding mandate

449

further study.

450

Patient variability: Our work uncovered a surprising clustering

451

pattern in plasma metabolic profiles. Samples from ICU patients formed very

452

distinct clusters corresponding to each individual patient, while samples from

453

healthy controls clustered tightly together, with no resolution at the level of the

454

individuals providing the samples. The ICU patient with plasma samples

455

clustered nearest to the group of healthy controls (red dots in Fig 4) had a similar

456

cortisol rhythm, a lower APACHE II score, and a shorter ICU stay than the other

457

patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that the patient-level resolution of the

458

metabolomics data shown in Fig 4 is linked to an individual patient’s state, and

459

that multiple-day sampling could show patient “trajectories” that move toward

460

improved or worsening health. However, we could discern no other pattern in the

461

PCA scores in this small study. While other researchers have associated

462

metabolomics data with mortality in critical illness (48), our finding raises the

463

possibility that metabolomics may provide broad insight into individual patients’

464

conditions. More focused research will have to be done to confirm and explain

465

the highly individualized patterns in sample clustering observed in ICU patients.

466

Disruptions to metabolism: Restricting the untargeted

467

metabolomics data from 25,000 features to those that differ between ICU

468

patients and healthy controls at the level of q<0.05 only reduced the data set to

469

15,000 features. These results indicate that ICU patients have highly disordered

470

metabolism relative to healthy controls.

471

To explore this, we analyzed the untargeted metabolomics data with

472

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Interestingly, each of the top 5 dysregulated

473

pathways identified by IPA have been linked to the circadian system.

474

Eicosanoids are broadly involved in inflammation, vasoconstriction, pain

475

perception, and cell growth and regulation. Prostanoids, a class of eicosanoids,

476

have long been known to oscillate with a daily rhythm in saliva (49). The

477

FXR/RXR activation pathway modulates bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism.

478

Bile acid synthesis, FXR, and RXR are all linked by the circadian system (50,

479

51). Finally, spermines and spermidines belong to the polyamide class of

480

molecules and regulate various genetic processes. Polyamine biosynthesis has

481

also been shown to intersect with the circadian system (52).

482

This pilot study had several limitations. We did not use a circadian

483

protocol with healthy controls or ICU patients. As such, we are unable to clearly

484

state whether the observed differences in 24-hour rhythms are due to

485

endogenous factors, exogenous factors, or both. This warrants further study.

486

Only 5 individuals per group were studied. Future work must include larger

487

groups. All 5 ICU patients had different underlying conditions. A more focused

488

study of patient groups with distinct underlying conditions (e.g. sepsis vs. stroke)

489

should be done to evaluate how individual diseases contribute to circadian

490

rhythm desynchronization and to observed patterns in the metabolomics data.

491

Core body temperature should be measured in all participants. The lack of

492

significant rhythm in temperature observed in healthy controls (p=0.091) may be

493

due to this.

494

Due to budgetary and logistical constraints, only positive mode reverse

495

phase MS1 data were collected. Future work should include negative mode

496

reverse phase and HILIC columns as well as MS2 data to aid in more complete

497

feature identification. The feature identification reported here is preliminary and

498

should be confirmed by targeted analyses in future work. Melatonin was not

499

conclusively identified in our mass spectrometry data and should be quantified by

500

mass spectrometry and/or radio immunoassay in future work. The IPA results

501

should be considered preliminary as well. Progenesis QI can assign more than

502

one HMDB ID to a feature, and IPA resolves duplicates by choosing the feature

503

with the lowest q-value. This may introduce biasing.

504

More frequent sampling of blood for metabolomics data would improve

505

profiling of circadian rhythms (53). The lack of statistical significance in individual

506

rhythms of metabolites, particularly in healthy controls, may be alleviated by

507

more data. Plasma samples could be collected at a higher frequency, or for a

508

longer period of time, or both. This supports our case that a larger study is

509

needed.

510

Finally, we recorded bedside light levels for all study participants.

511

However, our light meter had to be replaced halfway through the study and we

512

did not feel that the data from the two separate meters could be meaningfully

513

compared. We have opted to not present these data in the manuscript. Despite

514

these limitations, the data clearly show a global disruption to 24-hour rhythms in

515

ICU patients as well as fascinating individual patterns in ICU patients’

516

metabolomes. Both results deserve further study.

517
518
519

Conclusions

520

This pilot study confirms the literature supporting a broad desynchronization of

521

circadian rhythms in ICU patients on multiple levels by measuring circadian

522

rhythms in vital signs and circulating metabolites. In addition, PCA of untargeted

523

metabolomics identifies a strong pattern in metabolomes of ICU patients, which

524

are highly individualized and distinct from healthy controls. These results suggest

525

a significant disordering of physiology in ICU patients, involving at a minimum the

526

metabolism and the circadian system, which should be characterized further in

527

order to determine the implications for patient care.
