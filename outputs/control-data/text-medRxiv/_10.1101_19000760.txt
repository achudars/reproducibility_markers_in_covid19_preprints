Abstract:
Background: Randomized clinical trials have provided clear evidence that long-term oxygen
therapy (LTOT) increases life expectancy in severely hypoxemic COPD patients. However, in
real-life settings, in global COPD cohorts, a paradoxical 2-3-fold increased risk of death has
been reported in patients under LTOT. This discrepancy could be explained by a subgroup of
patients under LTOT who do not meet the current guidelines and for whom LTOT would be
associated with poor prognosis. This retrospective study of a global COPD cohort therefore
sought to: (1) determine if a subgroup of patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia
could be distinguished, and (2) compare the mortality risk according to hypoxemia severity
and LTOT prescription.
Method: The sample was taken from a database (NCT02055885) on 191 stable COPD
patients (age: 65.1±9.8 years, 85 women) admitted for a pulmonary rehabilitation program
between 2009 and 2012 and followed until 1 January 2018. Uni- and multivariate Cox
proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to examine the associations between clinical
characteristics (age, sex, blood gases, etc.), LTOT according to PaO2 level, and mortality.
Results: Forty patients (21%) were under LTOT at PR entry despite not meeting the O2
prescription criteria. Patients under LTOT had a nearly 2-fold higher mortality risk adjusted
by covariates (HRmultivariate=1.83; p=0.009). Furthermore, the higher mortality risk under
LTOT

was

specific

to

the

patients

under

LTOT

without

severe

hypoxemia

(HRmultivariate=2.39; p=0.04).
Conclusion: The association between LTOT and mortality might be attributed to a subgroup
under LTOT despite not/no longer meeting the LTOT criteria. Further studies are needed to
identify the physiological basis of this phenomenon.

Introduction

2

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is a proven, well-established therapy to increase life

3

expectancy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with severe

4

hypoxemia. The first data on LTOT’s effects indicated an almost 2-fold increase in survival

5

rates in severely hypoxemic COPD patients undergoing LTOT (PaO2≤55 mmHg, or 59

6

mmHg with concurrent polycythemia or signs of right-sided heart failure or pulmonary

7

hypertension)1, 2. While the benefits of O2 therapy for severely hypoxemic COPD patients are

8

indisputable, the benefits for the overall COPD population remain unclear. Indeed, a

9

paradoxical association has been reported in global COPD cohorts that include all stages of

10

hypoxemia, with a 2-3-fold increased risk of death in those undergoing LTOT3-5. This

11

association remained even after controlling for disease severity (FEV1), age, BMI, and

12

exacerbations3-5.

13

Thus, despite LTOT’s substantial clinical impact, its association with a higher risk of death

14

remains unclear as it has not been investigated. Yet if LTOT slows the mortality rate in some

15

types of patients (i.e., severely hypoxemic) but shows an inverse association with the

16

mortality risk in the overall COPD population, this indicates another subgroup of patients who

17

do not meet the current guidelines for LTOT prescription and for whom O2 therapy is

18

associated with deleterious consequences. This study of a global COPD cohort therefore

19

sought to: (1) determine whether a subgroup of patients under LTOT without severe

20

hypoxemia could be distinguished, and (2) compare the mortality risk according to the

21

severity of hypoxemia and LTOT prescription.

Methods

23

The sample was taken from an unpublished database (NCT02055885) on 191 stable COPD

24

patients (mean age: 65.1±9.8 years, 85 women) who were admitted to the Cliniques du

25

Souffle in France between 2009 and 2012 for a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PR) and

26

followed until 1 January 2018. Blood gases were evaluated on the day patients entered PR, at

27

rest and while breathing room air. No LTOT indications noted by the physician-prescriber

28

were modified, but potential differences with LTOT guidelines were reported by the PR

29

physician in the patient’s medical record. The patients were categorized into 4 groups

30

according to their resting PaO2 on air (≤59 mmHg or >59 mmHg, labeled as severe or not-

31

severe hypoxemia: SH or nSH) and LTOT prescription (LTOT or nLTOT):

32

•

nSH-LTOT (PaO2>59 mmHg and LTOT)

33

•

nSH-nLTOT (PaO2>59 mmHg and no LTOT)

34

•

SH-nTOT (PaO2≤59 mmHg and no LTOT)

35

•

SH-LTOT (PaO2≤59 mmHg and LTOT)

36

The baseline clinical characteristics of the 4 groups were compared using ANOVA and HSD

37

post-hoc tests. Time to event was defined as the time (in months) from entry to PR to the

38

month of death or the month when follow-up ended (i.e., 1 January 2018). Univariate and

39

multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to examine the

40

associations between clinical characteristics (age, sex, body mass index: BMI, FEV1,

41

FEV1/FVC, PaO2, PaCO2 and 6-minute walking distance: 6MWD), LTOT according to PaO2

42

level, and mortality. Using the means of these covariates in the Cox regression model, the

43

estimated survival functions were calculated for each subgroup. Statistical analyses were

44

conducted with Statistica Software (Statsoft, V13.0, OK, USA). The significance level was set

45

at p≤0.05.

Results

47

The median follow-up was 84.7 [Q1: 1.1; Q3: 108.7] months. Descriptive statistics of the

48

population are provided in Table 1. Forty patients were under LTOT (nSH-LTOT group; 21%

49

of the study sample) at PR entry despite not meeting the O2 prescription criteria. First, we

50

confirmed that the patients under LTOT had a nearly 2-fold higher mortality risk adjusted by

51

covariates (HRmultivariate=1.83; 95% confidence intervals: CI=1.16-2.9; p=0.009, data not

52

presented in table). Furthermore, we found that the higher mortality risk under LTOT was

53

specific to the patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia (nSH-LTOT group; Table 2).

54

In both univariate and multivariate analyses, these patients had an almost 2.5-fold higher

55

mortality risk than the patients without severe hypoxemia and without LTOT

56

(HRmultivariate=2.39; 95% CI=1.42-4.03; p=0.04). Figure 1 displays the adjusted survival curves

57

for each subgroup.

Discussion

59

In line with previous studies, this study showed a higher mortality risk in patients under

60

LTOT in a general COPD population with various hypoxemia severities3-5. In addition, we

61

specifically found a nearly 2.5-fold higher mortality risk in the patients under LTOT without

62

severe hypoxemia (PaO2>59 mmHg). Therefore, our data shed new light on the paradoxical

63

association between LTOT and mortality in a global COPD cohort, which might be attributed

64

to a subgroup of patients receiving LTOT despite not/no longer meeting the LTOT criteria.

65

Past research has indicated that COPD patients with PaO2>59 mmHg are sometimes

66

prescribed LTOT despite not meeting the indication criteria6. This inappropriate prescription

67

has been ascribed to insufficient adherence to guidelines by prescribing physicians7. For

68

example, one study found that 18.5% of COPD patients undergoing LTOT had resting PaO2

69

on air >60 mmHg at the time of prescription8. LTOT started in unstable patients after

70

hospitalization and poor treatment re-evaluation are also worth considering: ~40% of patients

71

who meet the hypoxemia criteria at a given time are no longer hypoxemic 1-3 months later1, 9.

72

Yet, most patients are never re-evaluated, whether in clinical practice7 or longitudinal clinical

73

trials10.

74

This study has limitations. First, the sample size was too small to draw definitive conclusions.

75

Furthermore, comorbidities, adherence to LTOT and exacerbations could not be retrieved.

76

Importantly, although not controlled in this study, the paradoxical association between LTOT

77

and mortality was previously observed regardless of exacerbations3.

Conclusion

79

This research suggests a plausible explanatory hypothesis about the paradoxical association

80

between mortality risk and LTOT in a general COPD cohort with various hypoxemia

81

severities. In the study, the higher mortality risk under LTOT was specifically found in

82

patients without severe hypoxemia and thus not meeting the current guidelines for LTOT

83

prescription (mean PaO2=69.9 mmHg). Larger controlled prospective clinical trials with O2

84

supplementation vs. non-supplementation in the overall COPD population are warranted to

85

identify a physiological explanation for this phenomenon and to rule out (or not) any causal

86

relationship.
