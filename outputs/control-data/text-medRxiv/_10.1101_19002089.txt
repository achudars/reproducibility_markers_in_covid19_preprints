ABSTRACT

Computational neuroscience has contributed to understanding compulsive behavior by
distinguishing habitual from goal-directed choice through model-free and model-based learning.
Yet, questions remain about applying this approach to psychiatric conditions that are
characterized by complex behaviors that occur outside the laboratory. Here, we compared
individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), whose self-starvation appears both excessively goaldirected and habitual, with healthy controls (HC) to assess: 1) whether their behavior is
characterized by enhanced or diminished model-based behavior, 2) the domain specificity of
any abnormalities by comparing learning in a food-specific context as well as in a monetary
context, and 3) whether impairments are secondary to starvation by comparing learning before
and after initial treatment. Across all conditions, individuals with AN showed an impairment in
model-based, but not model-free, learning, suggesting a general and persistent contribution of
habitual over goal-directed control, across domains and timepoints.

INTRODUCTION
The pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses is poorly understood. Little is known about
etiologies, diagnostic tests mainly serve to rule out medical illness, and underlying neural
mechanisms remain mysterious. These problems stem, in part, from the great challenge of
understanding the mechanisms of mental processes even in the healthy brain. Recent
advances in cognitive and computational neuroscience offer promising new approaches for
understanding brain mechanisms underlying psychiatric symptoms (Huys, Maia, & Frank, 2016).
For example, the emerging understanding of the brain’s systems for habitual vs. goal-directed
control has offered a potential mechanism underlying compulsive symptomatology (Everitt &
Robbins, 2016), which can occur across a range of psychiatric illnesses. In the present study,
we apply methods for probing habitual versus goal-directed behavior in relation to anorexia
nervosa (AN), in which the central behavioral feature appears to be both extremely goal-focused
(unrelenting pursuit of thinness) and yet rigidly unchangeable (poor responses to treatment)
(Walsh, 2013), thereby challenging a simple automatic-vs-controlled dichotomy.

The existence of a dichotomy between automatic and controlled behavior is a long-standing
organizing principle in psychology and neuroscience (James, 1890), and recent research shows
that controlled or goal-driven, motivated behaviors can be distinguished behaviorally and
neurally from cue-elicited, automatic behaviors (“habits”) (Dickinson & Balleine, 2002; Graybiel,
2008). These two types of behavior have been argued to arise from distinct computational
mechanisms for evaluating actions, known as model-based and model-free learning (Daw,
Gershman, Seymour, Dayan, & Dolan, 2011; Daw, Niv, & Dayan, 2005). Goal-directed (or
model-based) behavior enables pursuit of long-term goals, even if there is conflict with shortterm temptations, and its deliberative nature offers the ability to update behavior when the value
of an outcome changes. Habitual (or model-free) behavior results from repetition of stimulusresponse associations and facilitates efficient automatic behavior in response to cues but
renders behavior relatively inflexible. In the lab, these approaches can be distinguished using
instrumental learning tasks that include outcome devaluation procedures and two-step Markov
decision tasks, and are associated with partially distinct neural substrates (Coutureau &
Killcross, 2003; Daw et al., 2011; Glascher, Daw, Dayan, & O'Doherty, 2010; Killcross &
Coutureau, 2003; Lee, Shimojo, & O'Doherty, 2014; Tricomi, Balleine, & O'Doherty, 2009;
Valentin, Dickinson, & O'Doherty, 2007; Yin, Knowlton, & Balleine, 2004; Yin, Knowlton, &
Balleine, 2006).

Experimental evidence shows that healthy people generally use a mix of both model-free and
model-based approaches, shifting the balance between them depending on circumstances
(Daw et al., 2011; Otto, Gershman, Markman, & Daw, 2013; Otto, Raio, Chiang, Phelps, & Daw,
2013; Weissengruber, Lee, O'Doherty, & Ruff, 2019). In contrast, reductions in model-based,
goal-directed behavior have been shown in disorders with compulsive behaviors, such as
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and binge eating disorder (Gillan et al., 2015; Gillan,
Robbins, Sahakian, van den Heuvel, & van Wingen, 2016; Voon et al., 2015). Together, these
studies suggest that a computational approach that distinguishes the contributions of habitual
and goal-directed behavior may help link psychiatric symptoms with dysfunction in basic neural
mechanisms.

Compulsive behavior, broadly, is action engaged in persistently, even when unrewarding or
maladaptive, and often despite an individual’s own assessment that it is excessive. Multiple
psychiatric disorders are characterized by behaviors with a seemingly compulsive character
(e.g., tic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorders, and eating
disorders; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and the persistence of these varied
compulsive behaviors is puzzling. One hypothesis is that excessive relative dominance of
automatic behavior underlies compulsivity (Everitt & Robbins, 2016; Gillan et al., 2015; Gillan &
Robbins, 2014). However, some basic questions remain about the adequacy and explanatory
potential of this framework for elucidating mechanisms of psychiatric illness, three of which we
address in the current study.

First, a range of psychiatric illnesses include behaviors that can be considered compulsive, but
the behaviors themselves are not always easily captured by the simple, repetitive, stimulusevoked habits described in the experimental literature. That is, categorizing the real-world
behaviors at the core of psychiatric illnesses is complex. For example, engagement in a
ritualized behavior to reduce anxiety symptoms in OCD may, in some ways, be compulsive and
automated, yet it can also be construed as a successful, goal-directed, strategy for managing
anxiety due to obsessions (Salkovskis, 1985). Similarly, drug-seeking behavior may be
compulsive, and at the same time require considerable flexible goal pursuit (Tiffany, 1990).

AN provides a particularly intriguing example. Maintenance of significantly low body weight is a
defining feature of AN (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This self-starvation appears to

be an unrelenting goal pursuit focused on weight loss, and individuals with AN are commonly
thought of as rigidly self-controlled (Bruch, 1979). Data from temporal discounting studies show
that individuals with AN are more likely than healthy comparison participants to forego
immediate monetary rewards in favor of larger, delayed rewards during intertemporal choices,
consistent with descriptions of heightened self-control (Decker, Figner, & Steinglass, 2015;
Steinglass et al., 2012; Steinglass et al., 2017). And yet, the restrictive eating that characterizes
AN also shares many features of habit (Foerde, Steinglass, Shohamy, & Walsh, 2015; Walsh,
2013): it is learned (not innate), is inflexibly triggered by certain cues, and individuals with AN
are unable to readily change this behavior—even when seeking treatment, suggesting that it
has become outcome-independent over time. The possibility that persistent maladaptive
choices in AN may reflect overlearned habits is particularly intriguing given that the behavior is
characterized by choices against normatively rewarding foods (e.g. foods high in sugar and fat).
Thus, it remains unclear whether maladaptive behavior in AN reflects excessively goal-directed
or excessively habitual behavioral control. More operationally, the question remains: if behavior
in AN arises from imbalance between goal-directed and habitual mechanisms, which one is
dominant?

Second, goal-directed and habitual behavior are domain-general mechanisms, as illustrated by
their trans-diagnostic application, yet, different psychiatric illnesses involve quite specific
compulsive behaviors (e.g., OCD with specific compulsions, abuse of specific substances,
gambling, or excessive weight loss). Most, if not all, laboratory studies have used generic
outcomes, typically money (Gillan et al., 2016; Voon et al., 2015) or food (Tricomi et al., 2009;
Valentin et al., 2007), to study goal-directed and habitual behavior. An important interpretational
question left open by these studies is whether apparent deficits in goal-directed control in
psychiatric patients are due to impairments in a domain-general mechanism, or instead to a
reorienting of goal-directed behavior toward the object of compulsion at the expense of other
domains. The latter view would predict that substance abusers, for instance, are relatively
unmotivated by money (and unwilling to pursue it with goal-directed control) but could mitigate
or even reverse their impairment if their drug of abuse was at stake. Similarly, for individuals
with AN, the balance of model-based and model-free control may be different for choices about
money than for choices about food. Thus, does psychopathology reflect a domain-general
deficit in goal-directed (model-based) learning, or something more outcome-specific? Whereas
studying many illness-specific outcomes (including drugs of abuse) in the lab comes with

obvious challenges, studying AN offers an opportunity to address this question via tasks in the
setting of food outcomes compared with money outcomes.

Third, the presence of model-based deficits in the setting of psychiatric illness only indicates a
correlation between the two and does not directly support the presumption that imbalanced
learning is a causal factor in developing maladaptive compulsions. Indeed, decreased goaldirected control may be a result of compulsive behaviors, as has been argued, for instance, for
neurological effects of drugs of abuse (Volkow et al., 2010). Overall, little is known about the
longitudinal progression of these deficits. For instance, are deficits in goal-directed control
remediated by treatment of psychopathology in disorders of compulsion? If deficits are
remediated, this would suggest that they are an acute symptom of the disorder, and likely not a
pre-existing cause. A recent study suggested that impairments in goal-directed behavior in OCD
are not remediated by cognitive behavioral therapy (Wheaton, Gillan, & Simpson, 2018). For AN
particularly, the secondary effects of starvation on cognition might be substantial. Thus, by
studying individuals with AN during acute illness and again after extensive inpatient weightrestoration treatment, the persistence of any learning differences and their relation to changes in
psychopathology can be assessed.

In this study we addressed these questions with a population of individuals with AN using a twostep Markov decision task (Figure 1) designed to assess the extent of model-based vs. modelfree learning. By examining an illness with complex and seemingly highly controlled (yet
maladaptive) behaviors, we aimed to test whether these reflect heightened or deficient modelbased behavior. We also compared results from food and monetary versions of the task to
examine the specificity of findings in the eating disorder domain and tested for the presence of
model-based vs. model-free behavior in the context of outcomes directly relevant to underlying
psychopathology. Whereas the monetary task assumes that money is rewarding, in the food
task participants were rewarded with points that they could use to select the food of their choice,
thereby allowing the food-relevant task to be motivationally relevant to both controls and
patients. Finally, we evaluated patients before and after inpatient weight-restoration treatment,
to begin to study the progression of model-based and model-free processes.

Figure 1. Two-step decision tasks used to assess model-free and model-based learning. A) Decision
task with monetary outcomes. Alien treasure pieces were converted into a monetary bonus at the end
of the task. B) Task with food outcomes. Food tokens were converted into access to a range of
preferred snack items and the selected snack was consumed after the task. (A, B) In both tasks, the
Stage 1 choice determined the transition to the next stage according to a fixed probability. One choice
was associated with transition to one particular Stage 2 state 70% of the time (Common transition) and
the other state 30% of the time (Rare transition). At Stage 2, participants made choices followed by
reward or no reward (both monetary and food outcomes were actualized after the task). Each Stage 2
option was associated with a probabilistic reward, which ranged from 0.25-0.75 and varied gradually
(according to a Gaussian random walk) and independently across trials (see examples in bottom rows
of A and B). C) Example trial steps from the monetary task.

RESULTS
As expected, the HC and AN groups differed on measures of eating disorder severity (Eating
Disorder Examination Questionnaire, EDEQ; (Fairburn, 2008; Fairburn & Beglin, 1994)),
depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI; (Beck & Steer, 1993)), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory, STAI; (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970)), and body mass index (BMI) at Time
1, but did not differ on age (see Table 1). Although all participants had IQ scores in the normal
range, there was a statistically significant group difference; IQ (which has been associated with
model-based learning in previous studies; (Gillan et al., 2016)) was included as a covariate in all
analyses. Additionally, age was included as a covariate, as the sample spanned adolescents
and adults and use of model-based learning has been shown to develop gradually across

adolescence (Decker, Otto, Daw, & Hartley, 2016). Mean BMI increased significantly from Time
1 to Time 2 among individuals with AN (t(23)=-13.01, p < 0.001) and did not differ significantly
between groups at Time 2, indicating successful weight restoration among individuals with AN.
In addition, among individuals with AN, the expected psychological change was seen as
measures of eating disorder pathology (EDEQ: t(24)=6.7, p < 0.001), depression (BDI:
t(23)=5.15, p < 0.001), and anxiety (STAI: t(24)=3.36, p = 0.003), significantly improved from
Time 1 to Time 2, although these measures remained elevated relative to HC (ps < 0.001, see

To examine task performance, we first tested whether individuals with AN differed from HC in
model-free and model-based learning overall, across both monetary and food outcome versions
at both assessment points (modeling any effects of task and session but considering first the
main effect of group). There was a significant contribution of model-free learning to behavior in
both groups (ps < 1e-5) and no significant difference between groups (Est: 0.09, SE = 0.06, z =
1.36, p = 0.174; Fig. 2). In contrast, model-based learning was also present in both groups (ps <
1e-5) but significantly attenuated in the AN group relative to the HC group (Est: 0.15, SE =
0.06, z = 2.27, p = 0.023; Fig. 2). To test the specificity of the group difference to model-based
relative to model-free learning, we repeated the analysis using the parameter 𝑤 (see Methods),

which measures the relative reliance on model-based learning and found that the relative
reliance 𝑤 was increased among HC (Est: 0.41, SE = 0.2, z = 2.06, p = 0.039).

Figure 2: Overall model-free and modelbased contributions to learning for HC
and AN across task type (monetary and
food) and session (Time 1 and Time 2).

Next, we tested whether the model-based deficit was domain-general or specific to monetary vs.
food outcomes (Table 2). Task type did not interact significantly with group differences in
model-based learning (Est: -0.08, SE = 0.07, z = -1.11, p = 0.27) and the same pattern of
impaired model-based learning in AN was observed regardless of outcome (Fig. 3A). There
was, however, a main effect of task such that all participants showed a greater model-based
contribution in the monetary task relative to the food outcome task (Est: 0.15, SE = 0.05, z =
2.78, p = 0.006).

The contribution of model-based vs. model-free learning may be hypothesized to differ based on
the state of illness. At Time 1, patients were generally undernourished (with potential sequelae
for neurocognitive functioning) and had higher psychological symptom burden (e.g., depression
and anxiety, see Table 1). Therefore, we tested participants before (Time 1) and after (Time 2)
weight restoration treatment. Although there appeared to be a tendency toward more modelbased behavior at Time 2 in both groups, this main effect was not significant (p = 0.15) and
there was no interaction between group and Session (Time 1 vs. Time 2) on model-based
learning (Est: 0.02, SE = 0.08, z = 0.27, p = 0.79, Fig. 3B).

across session (Time 1 and Time 2). B) Model-based contributions to learning at
Time 1 and Time 2 across task type (monetary and food task).

Post-Test Assessment of Task Transition Structure
HC and AN did not differ significantly in their recall of the transition structure for the monetary or
food outcomes task at Time 1 (Money: χ2(1, N = 87) = 0.274, p = 0.60; Food: χ2(1, N = 84) =
0.925, p = 0.34) or Time 2 (Money: χ2(1, N = 52) = 0.006, p = 0.94; Food: χ2(1, N = 52) = 0.650,
p = 0.42). HC and AN also did not differ significantly on the average discrepancy between their
estimates of the transition probabilities and the actual probabilities at Time 1 (Money: t(82) = 0.91, p = 0.37; Food: t(82) = -0.59, p = 0.56) or Time 2 (Money: t(51) = -1.73, p = 0.09; Food:
t(51) = -1.34, p = 0.18).

Correlations with clinical variables
Model-based behavior was not significantly associated with BMI (over and above the group
difference) or duration of illness in the patient group (BMI: Est: 0.003, SE = 0.03, z = 0.09, p =
0.93; Duration: Est: 0.05, SE = 0.07, z = 0.80, p = 0.42). In AN at Time 1, higher scores on the
YBC-EDS were associated with less model-based learning for food outcomes relative to
monetary outcomes (Est: 0.09, SE = 0.05, z = 1.95, p = 0.051), a trend mainly driven by (and
significant for) the Preoccupations subscale (Est: 0.13, SE = 0.04, z = 3.07, p = 0.002) rather
than the Rituals subscale (Est: 0.04, SE = 0.05, z = 0.77, p = 0.44). (Data were not collected
from HC, for whom scores would be expected to be zero, or from AN after weight restoration.)

AN subtypes
Individuals with AN can be classified as either restricting (AN-R) or binge eating/purging (ANBP) subtype and the current sample was split approximately equally between subtypes (19 ANR, 22 AN-BP). Exploratory analyses suggested that the impairment in model-based learning
was largely driven by individuals with AN meeting criteria for binge-eating/purging, rather than
restricting subtype (see supplementary material and supplementary Fig. S1).

DISCUSSION
This study addressed three questions about the intersection of computational neuroscience and
psychiatry by examining goal-directed and habitual learning mechanisms in AN. We tested
whether AN, which appears at once excessively goal-directed and habitual, is characterized by
enhanced or diminished model-based behavior. We further examined model-based versus
model-free learning in a food-specific context as well as a monetary context, to test the domainspecificity of any differences, and before and after weight restoration, to test whether
impairments were present only during acute illness or were instead a more stable characteristic
of patients with AN. Individuals with AN showed less model-based learning than HC, and groups
did not differ in model-free learning. This group difference was present when playing for both
food and monetary outcomes and persisted after successful weight-restoration treatment.

How does the extreme, yet inflexible, “self-control” that characterizes AN relate to model-based
learning?
AN poses a fascinating conceptual challenge for the classic psychological dichotomy between
goal-directed, controlled behavior and inflexible, habitual responses. Selection of a low-fat, low

calorie diet with limited variety is a stereotyped feature of illness in AN (Mayer, Schebendach,
Bodell, Shingleton, & Walsh, 2012; Schebendach et al., 2008; Sysko, Walsh, Schebendach, &
Wilson, 2005). Yet nearly half of patients also engage in eating that is accompanied by a sense
of loss of control (binge eating). The coexistence of these behaviors, as well as other indicators
that behavior is actually quite inflexible in AN, makes this illness particularly intriguing as an
opportunity to better understand the relative contributions of goal-directed and habitual
behavior. Maladaptive behaviors in AN are commonly understood to reflect heightened selfcontrol, which might be expected to relate to enhanced dominance of goal-directed (or modelbased) behavior. Yet these same behaviors are also rigid and difficult to change, which might
suggest the opposite result: relatively weakened model-based control. This study allowed us to
test existing hypotheses that impairments in goal-directed, or model-based, behavior are a
transdiagnostic mechanism underlying compulsive psychopathology (Gillan et al., 2016; Voon et
al., 2015).

Our results suggest that, compared to HC, AN rely significantly less on the model-based
approach, similar to individuals with other disorders involving compulsion such as OCD or drug
abuse (Gillan et al., 2016; Voon et al., 2015). The pathology of AN involves complex, multi-step
phenomena to avoid food intake. The findings in this study suggest that these computational
mechanisms may be relevant even to producing behaviors, like pathological food avoidance,
that extend beyond the traditional notion from animal behavioral psychology of habits as simple
stimulus-response motor programs. Indeed, a recent study in a large general population sample
found that model-based behavior in the Two-Step task, used herein, correlated with a set of
psychiatric symptoms that included not just simple compulsive actions (such as repetitive
checking or morning drinking) that extend easily from a basic notion of habits but also broader,
more cognitive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts (Gillan et al., 2016). In contrast, this study
found no significant difference between AN and HC in the model-free approach in the task, and
groups also differed significantly in a composite index of relative reliance on the two systems,
supporting the specificity of the effect. That said, as with previous studies using this task (Gillan
et al., 2016), we focused our hypotheses and analyses on the modulation of model-based
behavior, as this has proven to be the measure from this task that has most reliably tracked
manipulations or individual differences likely to be relevant to the goal-habit balance (Otto, Raio,
et al., 2013; Otto, Skatova, Madlon-Kay, & Daw, 2015).

Does specific psychopathology reflect a domain-general failure of model-based learning?
Our data indicate that the deficit in model-based learning in AN was not significantly remediated
by using food outcomes. Rather, it was consistent across both domain-general (money) and
illness-specific (food) outcomes, with no significant task differences in the group effect. This
finding cuts against one potential explanation for the current results on the money task and
other similar results showing reduced model-based learning for money in psychiatric
populations (Voon et al., 2015): that generic monetary outcomes are less motivating in
psychiatric populations than they are for HC participants. Interestingly, it has recently been
shown that incentives can reliably boost model-based performance–even in the more severe
end of the spectrum for a range of psychopathology constructs (Patzelt, Kool, Millner, &
Gershman, 2019). By using an incentive-compatible food outcome (success on the Two-Step
task led to actual snack choices after the task), the present study included a condition in which
motivation would be expected to be more salient for individuals with AN than for HC. Yet, even
in the food context, patients with AN showed less model-based behavior than HC. Of course,
the failure to detect a Group-by-Task interaction is a negative result, and as with any such
result, the possibility remains that there does exist some interaction smaller than our study was
powered to detect. However, this is mitigated by a positive result: that AN were significantly
impaired at model-based learning, relative to HC, even in the food task considered alone
(Est=0.17, SE=0.067, z=2.6, p=0.01).

Exploratory analyses of the relationship between symptom severity and task performance in AN
did suggest one result that was selective for the food task: higher scores on the YBC-EDS,
especially the Preoccupation subscale, were associated with less model-based learning for food
outcomes relative to monetary outcomes. Such a graded deficit seems plausible, and its
specificity to food intriguing, but it is of note that the direction of the effect (worse learning with
food outcomes) is opposite that predicted by a motivational account. Also, given the exploratory
nature of the analysis and the smaller number of data points underlying it, there is a danger of
false positives and replication will be required to confirm this finding.

Are model-based deficits secondary to psychopathology, or potentially primary?
The idea that compulsive psychopathology might relate to impaired model-based learning is
appealing in part because it hints at a causal mechanism by which pathological habits might
emerge. Of course we are not in a position to address causality, nor even whether the cognitive

deficits precede the symptoms. However, we were able to address whether the cognitive
differences between AN and HC persisted after acute weight restoration. That they did indicates
they were not due to starvation alone. Prior research has shown that while psychological
measures improve with weight restoration, eating behavior—namely, the pursuit of low-fat lowcalorie diets—does not improve substantially with weight restoration (Mayer et al., 2012; Sysko
et al., 2005). Additionally, in a previous study we found that deficits in feedback-based learning
remained after weight restoration (Foerde & Steinglass, 2017). The effect on model-based
learning here shows a similar persistence, consistent with model-based deficits as a relatively
stable characteristic in AN. This result also parallels a recent report, using the same task, that
cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD also does not improve goal-directed deficits in that
population (Wheaton et al., 2018). In the current dataset, the absence of an effect of weight
restoration is a negative result and subject to similar interpretational caveats as the money vs.
food contrast. However, the confidence interval on the effect suggests that any undetected
effect of weight restoration on model-based behavior is likely to be quite small relative to the
overall deficit.

Conclusion
Previous work has shown deficits in responding to reward (DeGuzman, Shott, Yang, Riederer, &
Frank, 2017; Frank, Shott, Hagman, & Mittal, 2013; O'Hara, Campbell, & Schmidt, 2015) and
learning from feedback in AN (Foerde & Steinglass, 2017; Lawrence et al., 2003; Shott et al.,
2012). The present results suggest that a more fine-grained parsing of this deficit is necessary.
Basic habitual learning mechanisms may be intact, whereas flexible responses to changing
contingencies and the ability to integrate a model of the environment into choices are impaired.
Individuals with AN understood the structure of the task as well as did HC, as both groups were
able to report verbally on the rules of transition in the task. Yet, individuals with AN were less
able to successfully use this information in their decision-making during the task. These findings
are consistent with the habit-centered model of AN (Walsh, 2013), which argues that, once
established, patterns of maladaptive eating in AN are no longer goal-directed. Relatedly,
maladaptive food choice is mediated in AN by dorsal striatum (Foerde et al., 2015).

Nonetheless, a paradox remains in that individuals with AN are characterized by less modelbased behavior but also more patient delay discounting in inter-temporal choices (Decker et al.,
2015; Steinglass et al., 2012; Steinglass et al., 2017). Generally, decreased model-based

behavior would be expected to be associated with increased delay discounting: both are broadly
associated with impulsivity, both are related to measures of executive functioning (Otto et al.,
2015; Shamosh et al., 2008), and both are enhanced by increasing dopamine levels in patients
with Parkinson’s disease (Foerde et al., 2016; Sharp, Foerde, Daw, & Shohamy, 2016). Also, a
recent study found that they were related across individuals (Hunter, Bornstein, & Hartley,
2018). One potential resolution of the paradox could lie with further consideration of subtypes of
AN. The present study found that the deficit in model-based learning was primarily present in
the AN-BP rather than the AN-R subtype (a pattern also found in a previous study, (Foerde &
Steinglass, 2017)). In contrast, decreased delay discounting has primarily been seen in the ANR rather than the AN-BP subtype (Decker et al., 2015; Steinglass et al., 2012). Further
explication of these patterns will rely on larger samples suited to parse the contributions of
subtypes and computational neuroscience and psychiatry approaches may be fruitful in
understanding the distinct manifestations of psychopathology within complex illnesses such as
AN.

The divergence between goal-directed and habitual behavior in AN could have implications for
how illness develops and how it becomes resistant to change. It is particularly important for an
illness that often develops in adolescence, a time during which model-free learning reigns and
model-based behavior only begins to emerge (Decker et al., 2016). The slower emergence of
model-based behavior across development suggests one mechanism that may nudge dieting
behavior down the habit (model-free) path, and may be one contributing factor to how this
eating behavior becomes so entrenched. More generally, these results also speak to the
promise of the goal-directed vs habitual dichotomy as a trans-diagnostic mechanism, associated
with compulsive symptomatology across disorders: the decision-making deficit here was
domain-general, not food-specific, and apparently not secondary to starvation. Finally, they
speak as well to the architecture of decision making in the healthy brain: they suggest that the
sorts of behaviors emitted in the absence of control go well beyond simple stimulus-response
habits, speaking to the inadequacy of current psychological and computational conceptions of
automatic behavior.

In summary, we found that model-based, and not model-free, behavior was impaired among
individuals with AN relative to HC. The deficit was not remediated by using real food as the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were 41 women with AN and 53 healthy comparison women (HC). Individuals were
eligible if they were between the ages of 16 and 46 years (Table 1), with an estimated IQ > 80
(measured by Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, WASI-II, (Wechsler, 1999)). Eligible
patients met DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria for AN—restricting (AN-R,
n=19) or binge eating/purging (AN-BP, n=22) subtype—and were receiving inpatient treatment
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) specialized Eating Disorders Unit. Patients
with AN were not eligible if they had a history of a psychotic disorder, were at imminent risk of
suicide, or met criteria for substance use disorder. Anxiety and depressive disorders were not
exclusionary, as these commonly co-occur with AN (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007).
Three individuals with AN were taking antidepressant medications (SSRIs). HC were recruited
through the community and were compensated $50 for their time. HC were group-matched for
age and ethnicity and were included if they had no current or past psychiatric illness, including
any history of an eating disorder, and had a body mass index (BMI) in the normal range (18–25
kg/m2). The HC group included 19 individuals who endorsed a history of dieting behavior. This
study was approved by the NYSPI Institutional Review Board; after complete description of the
study to the participants, adult participants provided written informed consent and adolescents
provided written assent with parental consent.

Procedure
Psychiatric diagnoses were established using the Semi Structured Interview for DSM-IV (SCID;
(First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 2002) and the Eating Disorders Assessment for DSM5
(EDA-5, (Sysko et al., 2012)). Height and weight were obtained on a beam balance scale
(Detecto, Webb, MO). Estimated IQ was assessed with the WASI-II (Wechsler, 1999). Severity
of eating disorder psychopathology was measured by the Eating Disorder Examination
Questionnaire (EDE-Q; (Fairburn, 2008; Fairburn & Beglin, 1994)), a 36-item self-report
assessment of eating disorder symptoms which has established community norms for
adolescents and adults. The four symptom subscales (Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape
Concern, and Weight Concern) are scored on a scale of 0-6 and averaged to obtain a “global”
score. In addition, participants with AN completed the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale
(YBC-EDS; (Mazure, Halmi, Sunday, Romano, & Einhorn, 1994)), an interview measure of
eating disorder symptoms with separate subscales related to Preoccupations and Rituals. Each

subscale is scored on a scale from 0-16 and the subscales are summed to obtain the total score
(ranging from 0-32). Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity on each measure.

Participants were assessed at two points: Individuals with AN were tested within 1 week of
hospital admission (Time 1) and again after inpatient weight restoration treatment to at least
90% ideal body weight (Metropolitan Life Insurance, 1959), corresponding to a body mass index
(BMI) of approximately 19.5-20.0 kg/m2 (Time 2). HC individuals were tested twice at an interval
group matched to AN (MHC = 51 +/- 23 days, MAN = 59 +/- 22 days, t(45) = 1.17, p = 0.25). Of
41 AN participants, 18 completed both time points, 16 completed only Time 1, and seven
completed only Time 2; of 53 HC participants, 29 completed both time points and 24 completed
only Time 1. For one AN participant, data from the food outcome task at Time 2 was lost due to
computer malfunction.

Two-Step Decision Task
Each participant completed two versions of the Two-Step Decision Task (Daw et al., 2011;
Decker et al., 2016; Sharp et al., 2016)—one that involved playing for money and one that
involved playing for a food snack to be consumed after the task (order counterbalanced across
participants). The tasks were structurally identical but included distinct cover stories and task
environments that matched the outcomes used (see Fig. 1AB). For both tasks each trial
proceeded in two stages (Fig. 1C). In the first stage (Stage 1), participants chose between two
spaceships (or cafés), revealing a second-stage (Stage 2) choice between two aliens (or food
trays). Each second-stage alien (or food tray) had a slowly changing chance of delivering space
treasure (or a food token) vs. nothing, necessitating continuous learning by trial and error. The
four Stage 2 options were determined by independently drifting Gaussian random walks with a
standard deviation = 0.025 and bounded by 0.25 and 0.75 probability of reward, such that the
reward probability associated with each Stage 2 option changed slowly from trial to trial (Fig.
1D). The response window at each stage was three seconds. Participants completed 200 trials
of each task.

A key design feature of the task was the probabilistic association between first- and secondstage choices: Choosing the blue spaceship (or blue café) lead to the purple planet (or green
kitchen) 70% of the time—a common transition, and the red planet (yellow kitchen) 30% of the
time—a rare transition. The contingencies were reversed for the green spaceship (pink café).

The transition structure between stages allows dissociation of model-free vs. model-based
learning strategies: Model-free learning is ignorant of transition structure and favors repeating a
first-step choice that ultimately results in reward, even if it does so via a low probability
transition. By contrast, model-based learning is sensitive to the transition contingencies and
uses them to infer the first-stage choice most likely to lead to the preferred second-stage
environment.

In the monetary version of the task, each piece of space treasure collected was worth $0.10 and
the total earned was paid out in cash at the end of the experiment. In the food version of the
task, the accrued tokens bought access to a selection of foods from which to choose a snack
item. Prior to completing the task, participants were given a “menu” (supplementary Fig. S2)
with pictures of 15 food items and were asked to rank them in order of preference, but were not
told that the ratings were related to later snack options. An increasing number of earned food
tokens granted access to an increasing number of preferred food items (e.g., 92 tokens
provided access to items ranked 9-15, 114 tokens or more provided access to all items, see
supplementary Table S1).

A subset of participants (HC: n=9, AN: n=18) completed a different version of the food decision
task (the monetary task was the same for all participants). In this version, rather than receiving a
food token vs. nothing as the second-stage outcome, participants saw a picture of a preferred
food item vs. a non-preferred food item. The specific food items were individually determined
per participant: prior to the decision task participants completed a rating task in which 9 food
items were rated on a scale from 1-9 (1= highly preferred). Participants were not instructed that
their ratings would relate to their later snack options. The food image participants received on
most trials determined which snack they would receive after the task. In this task, participants
had 2 seconds to make choices in both stages. Results were qualitatively similar for both food
tasks, and they were therefore combined in all analysis below.

After completing the Two-step tasks, participants’ knowledge of the transition structure between
Stage 1 and Stage 2 (e.g., If you picked the blue spaceship, which planet would you most likely
land on?) and their estimates of the transition probabilities were assessed (e.g., If you picked
the blue spaceship, how likely would you be to see the purple planet?). Responses were not

collected from 3 HC for the monetary task at Time 1 and from 1 AN on both the monetary and
food tasks at Time 2.

Data analysis
Demographic and clinical variables were compared using independent t-tests. Measures of
psychopathology at Time 1 and Time 2 were compared within AN using paired t-tests.

Assessment of Model-based and Model-free learning (Computational Model)
In order to capture the influence of incremental learning across many trials, we fit subjects’
choices using a reinforcement learning model in which choices are modeled as arising due to
the weighted combination of model-free and model-based reinforcement learning. The model is
equivalent to the one used by Gillan et al. (Gillan et al., 2016) and Otto et al. (Otto, Raio, et al.,
2013), except that following Sharp et al. (Sharp et al., 2016) we have eliminated one free
parameter (by setting 𝛽#$% in the GIllan model to 0, or equivalently 𝜆 in the Otto model to 1). It
reflects a simplification and a change of variables over the model from Daw et al. (Daw et al.,
2011).
On each trial, 𝑡, participants make a Stage 1 choice 𝑐),+ , leading to a transition to a Stage 2
state 𝑠+ where another choice, 𝑐-,+ is made, followed by reward 𝑟+ . At Stage 2, it is assumed that
participants learn a value function over states and choices, 𝑄 0+123- (𝑠, 𝑐), whose value for the
chosen action is updated based on the reward received at each trial according to a delta rule,

equivalent to rescaling the rewards and 𝑄s by a and the corresponding weighting parameters b

is a binary indicator of whether a choice repeats the previous trial’s choice, so the weight 𝛽 0+JKL
measures the general tendency to perseverate or switch regardless of feedback.

At the end of each trial, all value estimates Q for unchosen actions and unvisited states are
decayed by multiplying by (1 − a).
The model has a total of five free parameters: four weights b (b0+123- , b#E , 𝛽#$ , 𝛽 0+JKL and a
learning rate a. Our main measures of interest are b#E and 𝛽#$ , measuring the contribution of
model-based and model-free learning.

The free parameters of the model were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of each
participant’s sequence of choices, using a distinct set of parameters for each game (i.e., each
combination of participant, session, and task type: up to four games per participant, two task
types at two timepoints). These were estimated jointly with group-level distributions over the
entire population using an Expectation Maximization procedure (Huys et al., 2011) implemented
in the Julia language (Bezanson, Karpinski, Shah, & Edelman, 2012). The per-game modelbased and model-free weightings 𝛽#E and 𝛽#$ , indicating the strength of each type of learning,
were extracted for further analysis. (We also computed a standard measure of their relative

fractional reliance, 𝑤 = OPQ 6OPR ; Daw et al, 2011.) These estimates were used as dependent
variables in a series of regression analyses with group as the main explanatory variable of
interest. All analyses controlled for task type, session, IQ, and age as additional independent
variables. In followup analyses, we included interactions of group by session or task, and
measures of disease severity (BMI, duration illness, and YBC-EDS); all covariates were zscored. The regressions were conducted using mixed-effects logistic regression, and estimated
using Julia’s MixedModels package. All within-subject parameters (e.g. task and session) were
taken as random effects per participant, so as the to capture the repeated-measure structure of

Model-based performance in AN-R vs. AN-BP subtypes
We further assessed model-based performance separately for ANs meeting criteria for
restricting (AN-R) vs. binge-eating/purging (AN-BP) subtype. As seen in Figure S1, HC were
most model-based, and AN-BP least model-based, with AN-R falling in between. The HC and
AN-BP groups differed significantly from each other (Est: 0.21, SE = 0.06, z = 3.36, p = 0.0008,
whereas AN-R did not differ significantly from AN-BP (Est: 0.12, SE = 0.09, z = 1.33, p = 0.18)
or HC (Est: -0.09, SE = 0.08, z = -1.05, p = 0.29).

Figure S1: Overall model-free contributions
to learning for healthy controls (HC), AN with
restricting subtype (AN-R) and AN with
binge-purge subtype (AN-BP) across task
type (monetary and food) and session (Time
1 and Time 2).
