Abstract:
Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone density. The prevalence of
osteoporosis varies between different populations and ethnic groups. Numerous studies
have investigated the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis
across ethnic populations. Present meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the
influence of common FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI VDR gene polymorphisms and
osteoporosis. PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer Link and Elsevier databases were
searched for eligible studies and all statistical calculations were performed by Open MetaAnalyst software. Studies investigated BsmI (65 studies; 6,880 case/ 8,049 control), ApaI
(31 studies; 3,763 case/ 3,934 control), FokI (18 studies; 1,895 case/ 1,722 control), and
TaqI (26 studies; 2,458 case/ 2,895 control) polymorphisms were included in the present
meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis revealed significant association between
dominant model of FokI (ORff+Ff vs. FF= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.04-1.36, p= 0.01, I2= 39.36%) in
overall analysis and recessive model of Caucasian population of TaqI polymorphism
(ORTT+Tt vs. tt= 1.35, 95% CI= 1.11-1.63, p= 0.002, I2= 50.07%). While no such effect is
found in any other genetic model in any other gene polymorphisms of the overall analyses
or sub-group analyses. In conclusion, we found the FokI polymorphism is associated with
osteoporosis in overall analysis, also the TaqI polymorphism is a risk factor for the
Caucasian population.

Introduction:
Bone is a very active tissue that maintain itself by continuously formation and
reabsorption. To maintain this equilibrium osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes plays
important role by performing bone resorption, formation and maintenance respectively
[1]. Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone density caused by increased
activity of osteoclasts and decreased bone turnover [2]. The prevalence of osteoporosis
greatly varies in different populations and ethnic groups [3]. Age and gender are the major
contributing factor in the occurrence of osteoporosis. Worldwide every one women out of
three over age of 50 will experience osteoporotic fractures in comparison to one in five
men of the same age group [4]. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors
are believed to play a central role in the etiology of osteoporosis [5, 6]. Among
environmental factors exercise and calcium intake are crucial risk factor for the
development of osteoporosis [5]. Now several evidences very well established that genetic

factors play important role in the development of osteoporosis like- (i) female offspring
of osteoporotic women have lower bone density in comparison with that of those with
normal bone density values [7], (ii) male offspring of men who are diagnosed with
idiopathic osteoporosis have lower bone mineral density (BMD) in comparison with that
of men with normal bone density values [8] and (iii) studies of female twins have shown
heritability of bone mineral density (BMD) to be 57% to 92% [9, 10].
Published studies have reported a list of effective genes for osteoporosis; the most
important of which are vitamin D receptor gene (VDR), estrogen receptor alpha (ESRα),
interleukin -6 (IL-6), Collagen type I (COLIA1), LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5)
[11, 12] etc. VDR gene polymorphisms have been reported to associated with the
development of several bone diseases, multiple sclerosis, vitamin D dependent rickets type
II and other complex diseases [13]. However, the mechanism by which the VDR gene
influences bone mass has not been fully elucidated.
In humans, VDR gene is mapped at chromosome 12 (12q12-q14), it has 11 exons and
spans ~75 kb of genomic DNA. The most studied VDR gene polymorphisms are- BsmI
(rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), FokI (rs10735810), and TaqI (rs731236).Although several
studies between osteoporosis and VDR gene polymorphisms have been published, the
results have been contradictory [14, 15], possibly because of variations in study design,
small sample sizes, varying ethnic backgrounds, or environmental factors. So, we
performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the role of these genetic polymorphisms in the
etiology of osteoporosis.
Materials and methods:
Different databases (PubMed; Google Scholar, SpringerLink) were searched up to
December 31, 2018 with the keywords ‘vitamin D receptor gene’, ‘BsmI’ , ‘ApaI’, ‘FokI’,
‘TaqI’, ‘VDR’, and ‘osteoporosis’. The retrieved studies were published from 1995 to
2018 and we thoroughly examined all retrieved articles to assess their appropriateness for
inclusion in the present meta-analysis.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
Eligible studies had to meet all of the following criteria: (a) the study should be a casecontrol study and (b) the articles must report the sample size, distribution of genotypes.
The following exclusion criteria were used for excluding studies: (a) studies conducted on
the animal model system; (b) studies that contained duplicate data; (c) no usable data
reported; (d) only cases were reported; and (e) book chapters or reviews articles.
Data extraction:
The following information were extracted from all the selected articles: (a) the name of the
first author; (b) year of publication; (c) country of study; (d) source of the control group;
and (e) distribution of genotypes in case and control groups. We also evaluated whether
the genotype distributions of control population of all the included studies were in
agreement of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).
Statistical analysis:
Meta-analysis was done according to the method given in Rai et al. [16]. Pooled odds ratio
(OR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) to investigate the association

Results:
For meta-analysis, we followed PRISMA guidelines. Figure 1 presents a flow chart of the
retrieved studies and the studies included and excluded, with specifying reasons in the
meta-analysis (Figure 1). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 81 studies were
found suitable for the inclusion in the present meta-analysis. Out of 81 included studies,
BsmI, ApaI, FokI and TaqI polymorphism were investigated in 65, 31, 18 and 26 studies
respectively.
Eligible studies:
For BsmI total 65 studies with 6,880 cases and 8,049 controls were found eligible to
include in the meta-analysis [17-81].
For ApaI total 31 studies with 3,763 cases and 3,934 controls were found to be eligible to
include in the meta-analysis [19, 23, 25, 33, 39, 40, 43, 46, 51, 58, 59, 61, 64, 66, 68, 70,
72, 74, 76, 78-80, 82-90].
For FokI meta-analysis total 18 studies with 1,895 cases and 1,722 controls were found
eligible to include in the meta-analysis [33, 40, 45, 51, 56, 62, 65, 66, 68, 70, 74, 76, 79,
91-95].
For TaqI total 26 studies including 2,458 cases and 2,895 controls were found eligible to
include in the meta-analysis [19, 23, 25, 33, 40, 43, 46, 51, 58, 59, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74,
76, 78-81, 87, 88, 90, 96, 97].
Meta-analysis
BsmI meta-analysis:
Meta-analysis with allele contrast model showed insignificant association with high
heterogeneity (ORbvsB= 0.89; 95% CI: 0.78-1.01; p= 0.09; I2= 82.02%; Pheterogeneity=
<0.001). No significant association was found in any other genetic model. In dominant
model (bb+Bb vs. BB): OR= 0.81, 95% CI= 0.68-0.97, p= 0.02; for homozygote model
(bb vs. BB): OR= 0.77, 95% CI= 0.60-0.99, p= 0.04; for co-dominant model (Bb vs. BB):
OR= 0.85, 95% CI= 0.73-0.98, p= 0.03; and for recessive model (BB+Bb vs. bb): OR=
0.88, 95% CI= 0.74-1.06, p= 0.20. High heterogeneity was found in all the genetic
contrast models except co-dominant model (Table 1; Figure 2).
The sub-group analyses were conducted on the basis of ethnicity. Out of 65 studies 37
were belongs to Caucasians, 22 were Asian and six were of other origin. High
heterogeneity was observed in almost all genetic models in all sub-groups. No significant
association were found in any sub-group analyses in any genetic model (Table 1; Figure
2).

TaqI meta-analysis:
Meta-analysis with allele contrast model showed insignificant association with high
heterogeneity (ORtvsT= 1.10; 95% CI: 0.91-1.32; p= 0.30; I2= 77.26%; Pheterogeneity=
<0.001). High heterogeneity was found in all other genetic models so random effect model
was applied. No significant association was found in any other genetic model. In dominant
model (tt+Tt vs. TT): OR= 1.09, 95% CI= 0.84-1.41, p= 0.48; for homozygote model (tt
vs. TT): OR= 1.20, 95% CI= 0.85-1.69, p= 0.29; for co-dominant model (Tt vs. TT): OR=

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis was performed by eliminating studies in which control population was
not in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (p <0.05). The control samples of 21 BsmI studies
[22, 25, 29, 33, 34, 39, 43-47, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 66, 71, 75] were deviated from
the HWE. Sensitivity analysis was performed after removal of these 21 studies and results
showed no significant association with osteoporosis risk in the main analysis (ORbvsB=
0.99; 95% CI: 0.85–1.15; p= 0.92; I2= 77.48%) or in any sub-groups- (Asian subgroupORbvsB= 0.99; 95% CI: 0.66–1.50; p= 0.99; I2= 83.65%: Caucasian subgroupORbvsB=0.96; 95% CI: 0.83–1.11; p= 0.65; I2= 69.61%: other studies subgroup- ORbvsB=
1.24; 95% CI: 0.64–2.43; p= 0.51; I2= 86.53%). Heterogeneity decreases both in the
overall and sub-group meta-analyses except the Asian studies.
In total 18 FokI studies, control population in five studies [51, 65, 74, 94, 95] were not in
HWE. After removal of these studies and no significant association was found in the main
analysis (ORfvsF = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.99–1.26; p= 0.05; I2= 46.48%) or in any sub-groups.
Heterogeneity was decreased both in the overall and sub-group meta-analyses.
The control samples of nine ApaI studies [23, 25, 39, 43, 46, 51, 66, 78, 89] were not in
HWE. Result of meta-analysis after removal of these nine studies showed no association
between ApaI polymorphism and osteoporosis risk in the main/overall analysis (ORavsA=

1.07; 95% CI: 0.90–1.27; p= 0.39; I2= 73.94%) and Caucasian population (ORavsA=0.85;
95% CI: 0.63–1.16; p= 0.32; I2= 78.62%) but the Asian population (ORavsA= 1.42; 95%
CI: 1.03–1.96; p= 0.03; I2= 77.61%); and subgroup other studies (recessive model:
ORAA+Aavs.aa= 1.49; 95% CI: 1.00–2.23; p= 0.04; I2= 52.4%) showed statistically
significant association with osteoporosis. Heterogeneity was also decreased both in the
overall and sub-group meta-analyses.
Out of 26 TaqI studies, control samples of four studies [23, 51, 72, 96] were deviated from
the HWE. Results of meta-analysis of 22 studies (after elimination of 4 studies deviated
from HWE) did not show any association between Taq1 polymorphism and osteoporosis
risk either in total studies (ORtvsT= 1.05; 95% CI: 0.85–1.29; p= 0.63; I2= 78.86%) or in
any sub-group. Moreover, removal of these 4 studies, heterogeneity was increased both in
the overall and sub-group meta-analyses except the Asian population.
Publication bias:
The funnel plots are symmetrical for all genetic models in overall and sub-group metaanalyses for all polymorphisms except recessive model of subgroup other studies in FokI
and co-dominant model of Asian studies in ApaI polymorphisms (Figure 6; Table 1-4).
Moreover, Egger’s test reveals no evidence of publication bias in any genetic model in
overall meta-analyses of all four polymorphisms.
Discussion:
VDRs are members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NR1I) family, which includes
pregnane X (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptors (CAR), which form heterodimers
with members of the retinoid X receptor family and expressed in the intestine, thyroid and
kidney [98]. Vitamin D receptor is considered to be the primary mediator of vitamin D
endocrine actions, which can regulate calcium homeostasis and reduce the risk of
osteoporosis. VDR translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus upon activation by binding of
its ligand 1-α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1-α-25(OH) 2D3) [99]. Numerous investigations
have reported that VDR gene polymorphisms were connected with the onset of
osteoporosis [81] and other diseases like- breast cancer [100], diabetes [101], myocardial
infarction [102] and metabolic syndrome and inflammation [103].
Meta-analysis is a well established statistical tool used for combining the data of small
sample sized individual studies. Meta-analysis increases the power of study and decreases
type I and II errors. During past two decades, a number of meta-analyses were published
which assessed the polymorphism of small effect genes as risk factor for different
diseases and disorders e.g. Down syndrome [16], neural tube defects [104], Glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [105], depression [106], schizophrenia [107],
Alzheimer [108], breast cancer [109], colorectal cancer [110], esophageal cancer [111]
and prostate cancer [112] etc.
During literature search we identified seven meta-analyses [15, 113- 118] investigating the
relationship VDR gene polymorphism and osteoporosis. BsmI, ApaI, FokI and TaqI
polymorphism were included in seven, four, two and two meta-analyses respectively.
BsmI polymorphism studies were included in all seven meta-analyses. Six meta-analyses
[15, 113-117] did not report any significant association between osteoporosis
susceptibility and BsmI polymorphism. Zhang et al [118] conducted a meta-analysis on the
risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with 36 studies including 7,192 subjects

and found marginally significant association (ORbvs.B= 1.2; CI= 1.00-1.46; p= 0.052). In
all the meta-analyses high between studies heterogeneity was not found except the study
conducted by Yu et al [115]. ApaI polymorphism was included in four meta-analyses
[113, 115, 117, 118]. Zintzaras et al [113], Yu et al [115], Wang et al [117] and Zhang et
al [118] included seven, six, three and 18 studies respectively in their meta-analyses and
all four studies reported no association between ApaI polymorphism and osteoporosis risk.
Zintzaras et al [113] and Zhang et al [118] conducted meta-analyses of three and 18
studies of FokI polymorphism and they did not found significant association between FokI
polymorphism and osteoporosis. Both groups [113, 118] also conducted meta-analyses of
TaqI polymorphism studies and again reported no association between TaqI
polymorphism and osteoporosis susceptibility.
In the present meta-analysis, four common VDR gene polymorphisms (BsmI, ApaI, FokI
and TaqI), largest sample size and highest number of studies were included. total 65
(14,929 samples), 31 (7,697 samples), 18 (3,617 samples) and 26 (5,353 samples) studies
for BsmI, ApaI, FokI and TaqI polymorphisms respectively were included. We found
significant association dominant model of FokI polymorphism (ff+Ff vs. FF: OR= 1.19,
95% CI= 1.04-1.36, p= 0.01) with low heterogeneity (I2= 39.36). No association was
found in sub-group analysis on the basis of ethnicity in any genetic model except in the
Caucasian population in the recessive model of TaqI polymorphism (TT+Tt vs. tt: OR=
1.35, 95% CI= 1.11-1.63, p= 0.002) with moderate heterogeneity (I2= 50.07).
The present meta-analysis has few demerits like- (i) used crude odds ratio, (ii) only
genetic polymorphisms considered, other factors such as environmental factors or food
habits are not included which might have important role in the etiology of osteoporosis.
With these limitations the present study has strength also like- (i) this is largest metaanalysis conducted both in number of included studies and number of sample size (81
studies; 19,268 samples), (ii) included all common VDR polymorphisms (BsmI, ApaI,
FokI and TaqI).
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found the FokI polymorphism is associated with osteoporosis also the
TaqI polymorphism is a risk factor for the Caucasian population. While other
polymorphisms (BsmI and ApaI) has no role in the etiology of osteoporosis in total or
stratified populations. Furthermore, we suggest that for the future case-control studies
gene–gene and gene–environment interactions should also be considered which might
well elucidate genetics of osteoporosis.
