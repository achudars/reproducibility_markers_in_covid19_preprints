Abstract

37

Background: Administrative data offer cost-effective, whole-of-population stroke

38

surveillance yet the lack of validated outcomes is a short-coming. The number of days spent

39

living at home after stroke (“home-time”) is a patient-centred outcome that can be objectively

40

ascertained from administrative data. Population-based validation against both severity and

41

outcome measures and for all subtypes is lacking.

42

Methods: Stroke hospitalisations from a state-wide census in New South Wales, Australia,

43

from July 1, 2005 to March 31, 2014 were linked to pre-hospital data, post-stroke admissions

44

and deaths. We calculated correlations between 90-day home-time and Glasgow Coma Scale

45

(GCS) scores, measured upon a patient’s initial contact with paramedics, and Functional

46

Independence Measure (FIM) scores, measured upon entry to rehabilitation after the acute

47

hospital stroke admission. Negative binomial regression models were used to identify

48

predictors of home-time.

49

Results: Patients with stroke (N=74,501) spent a median of 53 days living at home after the

50

event. Median home-time was 60 days after ischaemic stroke, 49 days after subarachnoid

51

haemorrhage and 0 days after intracerebral haemorrhage. GCS and FIM scores significantly

52

correlated with home-time (p-values<0.001). Female sex predicted less home-time in

53

ischaemic stroke, while being married increased home time after ischaemic stroke and

54

subarachnoid haemorrhage.

55

Conclusions: Home-time measured using administrative data is a robust, replicable and valid

56

patient-centred outcome enabling inexpensive population-based surveillance.

1. Introduction

64

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability with significant global disparities in

65

incidence, mortality and morbidity [1]. Over the past two decades there have been

66

considerable advances in primary and secondary stroke prevention, particularly in high-

67

income nations [2-5] and, more recently, health services have been re-designed in several

68

countries to facilitate access to multidisciplinary stroke unit care, thrombolysis and

69

mechanical thrombectomy for ischaemic stroke and endovascular coiling for subarachnoid

70

haemorrhage [6-9]. Monitoring stroke outcomes can assist in identifying areas of need,

71

informing implementation strategies to bridge evidence-practice gaps. Administrative data

72

offer a cost-effective alternative to labour-intensive gold-standard epidemiological studies,

73

providing whole-of-population stroke surveillance [10]. However, the absence of validated

74

outcomes after stroke is a significant shortcoming.

75

Home-time measures the number of days spent at home after stroke onset, taking into account

76

patient survival and days spent in hospital, reflecting a patient’s capacity to return to their

77

private residence after hospitalisation [11-15]. Home-time therefore can be unobtrusively and

78

objectively measured using routinely collected data that are linked to health records following

79

stroke and is proposed as a patient-centred surrogate measure of functional status. Unlike

80

traditional stroke outcome measures, such as the modified Rankin Scale, the validity of

81

home-time is not threatened by inter-rater variability, attrition of research participants or

82

respondent characteristics (proxy versus patient) [16,17]. Home-time derived from

83

administrative data may therefore be a cost-effective adjunct to traditional patient reported

84

outcomes to minimise selection bias, improve the reliability of outcome assessment and allow

85

continuous large-scale monitoring that otherwise would be impracticable. Deriving home-

86

time from administrative data may also broaden patient representation in epidemiological and

87

health services research. For example, patients whose preferred language is not the dominant

88

community language or those with cognitive impairment may encounter barriers to effective

89

engagement in research and quality assurance activities. Characterised in this way, home-

90

time is inclusive, ascertained for all patients irrespective of their socio-demographic and

91

health characteristics.

92

Few studies validating home-time are population-based or have validated home-time against

93

both severity and outcome measures and for all stroke sub-types [11,14]. Further, there is

94

limited information about prognostic indicators of home-time and validation has yet to be

95

conducted where severity, home-time and functional status are measured wholly using

96

routinely collected data. We analysed a jurisdiction-wide analysis reporting population-based

97

estimates of home-time and validated home-time as an outcome measure for routine stroke

98

surveillance.

99

2. Methods

100

Reporting according to the “REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-

101

collected health Data (RECORD) Statement” is reported in Supplementary Table 1.

102

2.1 Patient Selection: The study was part of the Home to Outcomes (H20) project which

103

aimed to report stroke epidemiology and outcomes in New South Wales (NSW), Australia’s

104

most populous state (population ~7.99 million in 2019). The project utilised linked routinely

105

collected pre-hospital, hospital, rehabilitation and mortality data. As previously described

106

[18,19] deterministic and probabilistic linkages were performed by the Centre for Health

107

Record Linkage (CHeReL) using gold-standard privacy preserving protocols and ensuring

108

that the linkage error rate was no greater than 5 per 1,000. Patient identifiers, such as names,

109

addresses, dates of birth and dates of health service delivery (for example, dates of

110

admission) facilitated linkage. Quality assurance of the linkage process undertaken by the

111

CHeReL has been described (http://www.cherel.org.au/quality-assurance).

112

Patients over the age of 15 years were identified from the Admitted Patient Data Collection, a

113

census of all hospital separations in NSW recording the principal diagnosis and up to 49

114

secondary diagnoses using the International Classification of Diseases, version 10, Australian

115

Modification (ICD-10AM) [20]. Applying ICD-10AM codes recommended to assign stroke

116

sub-types [21,22], we selected admissions with a principal diagnosis of subarachnoid

117

haemorrhage (ICD-10AM I60), intracerebral haemorrhage (ICD-10AM I61, I62.9) and

118

ischaemic stroke (ICS-10AM I63, I64) from January1, 2005 to March 31st, 2014 providing a

119

minimum follow-up of 90-days to June 30, 2014, the most recently available data at the time

120

linkage was performed. Strokes recorded in secondary diagnostic positions were included if

121

the primary diagnosis indicated an acute stroke event, where iatrogenic causes were identified

122

or where the stroke was flagged as occurring in hospital. Where primary diagnoses indicated

123

I64 or I62.9 codes (unspecified stroke and unspecified haemorrhagic stroke, respectively), we

124

interrogated records for more specific stroke codes to assign stroke-subtype. Sub-type was

125

defined in this manner for 2,417 or 2.5% of cases; otherwise, we adhered to

126

recommendations to code these cases as ischaemic stroke (that is, I64) [21] or intracerebral

127

haemorrhage (that is, I62.9) [22].

128

As previously reported [18,19], patients where ineligible if resident outside NSW or if cases

129

had concomitantly recorded major head trauma (ICD-10AM S04, S06, S07, S08, S17, S18,

130

S01.7, S02.0, S02.1, S02.6, S02.7, S03.0, S09.0, S09.2, S09, S05.2, S05.7) or primary or

131

metastatic cerebral neoplasms (C71,C70.0,C70.9, C79.3,D33.0, D33.1, D33.2, D33.3,

132

D33.9). We excluded cases whose initial stroke diagnosis was revised upon transfer to

133

another hospital by the end of the next day after presentation as presumed misclassified cases.

134

Early discharges home, defined as completion of care allowing discharge within the first 48

135

hours, were excluded to increase the specificity of case ascertainment consistent with

136

previous approaches [23-25] and remove patients with early symptom resolution suggesting

137

transient ischaemic attack or stroke mimics and cases with unrevised provisional stroke

138

diagnoses. Patients transferred for care outside the state and other transfers in the absence of

139

contiguous records were also excluded as missing hospitalisation data precluded accurate

140

calculation of home-time. The first eligible stroke admission (“index admission”) for each

141

patient during the study period was selected for analysis.

142

2.2 Calculation of 90-day home-time: In keeping with other research [14], home-time was

143

defined as the sum of full days not spent in hospital in the 90 days after the stroke admission.

144

For patients dying or newly discharged to a nursing home within 90-days, zero days were

145

counted from the date of death or discharge, respectively. Ninety-day “home-time” was

146

calculated by linking stroke cases to subsequent hospital records and the state death register

147

to June 30, 2014. Hospital records incorporated the acute stroke admission including inter-

148

hospital transfers, any contiguously recorded in-patient rehabilitation following the acute

149

period of stay and all subsequent acute and sub-acute readmissions for any reason, including

150

rehabilitation. Hospital encounters also included same-day admissions, which included out-

151

patient rehabilitation.

152

Prior to applying eligibility and exclusion criteria, we undertook data cleaning for cases with

153

illogical death record data to facilitate valid calculation of 90-day home-time. Specifically,

154

there were 70 death records with duplicate records indicating more than one probable linkage

155

to mortality data. We selected the record with information consistent with data recorded in

156

the other available linked data-sets (for example, consistent age and sex between death and

157

admissions records). There were a further 38 records with dates of death preceding hospital

158

discharge by more than one day. Of these, eleven were deemed clerical errors and accepted as

159

valid, while the remaining were considered erroneously linked death records.

2.31 Proxy stroke severity measurement

162

As described previously [19], we developed a proxy measure of stroke severity incorporating

163

the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and mode of arrival (ambulance or private transport) by

164

linking admissions to pre-hospital data obtained from Ambulance NSW, the sole provider of

165

emergency services for the state. Total GCS scores were obtained from the initial pre-hospital

166

vital signs survey recorded at first contact with paramedics. Pre-determined cut-offs

167

categorised patients as fully alert with a maximum score of 15 or with mild, moderate or

168

severe levels of lowered consciousness [26,27]. Self-presenting patients arriving to hospital

169

by private transport were considered “ambulant”. Both arrival mode and GCS were near

170

universally available, measured prospectively at first contact with health services and

171

ascertained blinded to patient outcomes. The GCS and mode of arrival strongly predict stroke

172

mortality [26-29], providing de-facto validity for the composite measure. Within the H20

173

study cohort, we have published a validation of the proxy severity measure in ischaemic

174

stroke (N>17,000 patients) demonstrating a strong association with 30-day mortality with

175

cross-validation of findings (N>18,000 patients) [19].

176

2.32 Functional Status: We obtained the 18-item Functional Independence Measure (FIM)

177

[30] from the NSW Subacute and Non-Acute Data Collection, recorded upon patient’s first

178

admission to inpatient rehabilitation within 90-days of the stroke admission. FIM scores were

179

available from July 1, 2009 for the sub-set of publicly funded hospitals, which provided

180

~70% of inpatient stroke rehabilitation in Australia during the study period [31]. The FIM

181

comprises 19 items, with 13 measuring motor function and five measuring cognitive function.

182

Each item was measured using a seven-point ordinal scale with higher scores indicating

183

greater independence with everyday tasks, such as mobility, eating, bathing, memory and

184

problem solving. Total scores ranged from 18 to 126, while motor and cognitive subscale

185

scores ranged from 13 to 91 and 5 to 35, respectively.

186

2.4 Statistical analysis: As home-time had a skewed distribution, we report median values

187

and the interquartile range (IQR) for all strokes and by stroke sub-type. Mean values (±

188

Standard Deviation) were calculated to enable comparisons with other studies. We calculated

189

Spearman correlations between home-time and GCS and FIM scores. These descriptive

190

analyses were repeated excluding patients dying in hospital who, by definition, spent zero

191

days at home. We also report mean and median values for “home-time” for each level of the

192

proxy stroke severity measure incorporating the GCS categories and mode of arrival.

193

To identify predictors of home-time, multivariate negative binomial regression was carried

194

out to take into account the skewed distribution of home-time and its measurement in counts

195

of whole days. We used generalised estimation equations to account for inter-dependencies of

196

data clustered on hospital of presentation. Modelling was carried out using PROC GENMOD

197

(SAS 9.4, SAS institute Inc, Cary, USA) and an exchangeable working correlation. Adjusted

198

means were derived from the model output. Potential predictors included age, sex, year of

199

admission, marital status and our proxy stroke severity measure. In addition, we ascertained

200

stroke history and Charlson comorbidities via linkage to prior hospitalisations up to July 1,

201

2001, providing 4.5 years of historical admissions data for all cases. To allow for departure

202

from linearity, we included both linear and quadratic terms for age and modelled each

203

Charlson comorbidity characterised by applying ICD-10 codes as reported by Quan,

204

Sundararjan, Halfon et al [32]. Hemiplegia and cerebrovascular disease were removed as

205

redundant [33] while the effect of HIV/AIDs was not assessed given its very low prevalence.

206

We modelled a measure of socio-economic status, the Index of Relative Socio-economic

207

Disadvantage (IRSD) [34] reflecting the degree of disadvantage within the geographical area

208

of patient residence based on area-aggregated indicators such as income, educational status

209

and occupation collected from a mandatory, national census carried out once every five years

210

(>95% participation rate of eligible households) [35]. IRSD scores are categorised into

211

quintile cut-offs with lower scores indicating greater relative disadvantage. Multivariate

212

analyses also adjusted for the length of time patients spent in hospital in the twelve-months

213

prior to the stroke admission to account for pre-existing comorbidity burden and health

214

service utilisation proximal to the stroke event. Analyses were undertaken separately for each

215

of the individual stroke sub-types given the well-established differences in patient

216

characteristics, risk factors and prognosis. All analyses were carried out using SAS software

217

(SAS 9.4, SAS institute Inc, Cary, USA).

218

2.5 Ethics

219

The NSW Population and Health Services Ethics Committee approved the study

220

(HREC/14/CIPHS/17).

221

3. Results

222

3.1 Patient selection and characteristics: Of the 83,866 potentially eligible stroke

223

admissions amongst NSW residents, there were 80,365 (95.8%) cases without known missing

224

home-time data. Of these, 74,501 were index admissions including 57,949 patients with

225

ischaemic stroke (77.8%), 12,192 with intracerebral haemorrhage (16.4%) and 4,360 with

226

subarachnoid haemorrhage (5.9%) for which home-time was calculated (Figure 1). Almost

227

half were female (N=37,097; 49.8%). One in four patients were older than 85 years of age

228

(24.6%), while 7.0% were younger than 50 years (Supplementary Table 1).

3.2 Descriptive analysis of home-time estimates: Median home-time in the 90-days after

260

stroke was 53 days (IQR=0 to 80 days). Median home-time was longer after an ischaemic

261

stroke (Median=60-days; IQR=0 to 81) and shortest after an intracerebral haemorrhage

262

(Median=0 days; IQR=0 to 63). Median home-time after a subarachnoid haemorrhage was

263

49 days (IQR=0 to 80 days). Almost 20% of patients (N=25,987) spent zero days at home in

264

the 90-days after stroke. Just under one-third of ischaemic stroke patients (N=17,575; 30.3%)

265

did not spend any full days at home compared with 55.2% (N=6,731) with intracerebral

266

haemorrhage and 38.6% (N=1,681) with subarachnoid haemorrhage. When the study

267

population was restricted to the sub-set of patients who survived their stroke admission, the

268

estimated median home-time was similar for patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid

269

haemorrhage (Median=70 days and 69 days, respectively) and lower for those with an

270

intracerebral haemorrhage (Median=55 days (IQR=5 to 78) (Table 1).

271

3.2.1 Descriptive statistics for home-time according to age and sex Median home-time was

272

15 days longer for males compared with females after an ischaemic stroke and nine days

273

longer for men after a subarachnoid haemorrhage (Table 1). While the median home-time

274

value for intracerebral haemorrhage was zero days for both sexes, the 75th percentile value for

275

home-time was 67 days for men and 59 days for women. When restricted to patients who

276

survived their stroke admission at discharge, median values for males remained higher for all

277

subtypes although differences were attenuated.

278

Increasing age was associated with a reduction in home-time for all sub-types. The decrease

279

in median time across age was relatively gradual after ischaemic stroke ranging from 80 days

280

in patients younger than 50 years of age to 56 days in those aged 75 to 84 years. Home-time

281

reduced to zero days in patients older than 85 years. After intracerebral haemorrhage, median

282

3.3 Validity of home-time

294

3.31 Association between home-time and proxy severity measure

295

Amongst self-presenting “ambulant” patients who did not require paramedic transport, the

296

median home-time was 76 days (IQR=39-84) after ischaemic stroke, 53 days (IQR=0 to 81

297

days) after intracerebral haemorrhage and 70 days (IQR=28 to 78) after subarachnoid

298

haemorrhage. GCS scores were available for 48,597 out of 49,150 (98.9%) patients

299

transported via ambulance. After either an intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage,

300

median home-time was zero for patients with any decreased level of consciousness (GCS

301

scores less than 15) (Table 1). Median home-time was zero after ischaemic stroke in patients

302

with GCS scores less than 13. Amongst patients surviving their stroke admission, home-time

303

decreased with decreasing levels of consciousness. However, in patients with haemorrhagic

304

stroke, median home-time was higher for patients whose GCS scores indicated “very severe”

305

brain injury (that is, unconscious patients), than for those with “severe” brain injury.

306

3.32 Home-time and GCS and FIM scores

307

Higher GCS scores indicating higher levels of consciousness were moderately and

308

significantly correlated with more home-time in ischaemic stroke and intracerebral

309

haemorrhage (rho=0.35 and rho=0.39) (p<0.001) (Table 3). GCS scores more strongly

310

correlated with home-time in subarachnoid haemorrhage (rho=0.51) (p<0.001). The

311

correlation between GCS scores and home-time remained significant in the sub-group of

312

patients who survived their stroke admission; however, the association was reduced (Table

313

3).

FIM scores were available from 2009 onwards for 8,353 patients undergoing publicly funded

329

in-patient rehabilitation. FIM scores correlated with home-time for all sub-types (rvalues=0.63

330

to 0.69) (p-values<0.001). Motor scores were more strongly correlated with home-time than

331

cognitive scores (rvalues=0.62 to 0.68 versus rvalues=0.36-0.47) (p-values<0.001) (Table 3) and

332

were largely unchanged when restricted to patients surviving their stroke admission.

333

3.4 Predictors of home-time

334

Increasing stroke severity assessed using our proxy composite measure independently

335

predicted fewer days spent at home after stroke for all subtypes in multivariate analyses (p-

336

values<0.001) (Figure 2; Supplementary Tables 2-5).

337

Amongst ischaemic stroke patients, married patients spent significantly more days at home

338

than single patients (Adjusted mean values=43 versus 39 days) (p<0.001) (Supplementary

339

Table 3). The effect of socio-economic status was near significant (p=0.05). Patients

340

residing in areas of least socio-economic disadvantage spent the greatest number of days at

341

home (42 days) although differences in adjusted means between categories were small (one

342

to two days). Home-time was reduced in the presence of all Charlson comorbidities tested,

343

except connective tissue disease. Dementia (31 versus 41 days), metastatic malignancy (27

344

versus 41 days) and moderate or severe liver disease (30 versus 41 days) had the greatest

345

impact on home time after ischaemic stroke. The adjusted effect of sex was significant

346

(p=0.02). While adjusted mean home-time values for males and females were equivalent (41

347

days) the confidence intervals suggesting a higher range of estimated values for males (95%

348

CI=41-42 versus 95% CI=40 to 41).

After intracerebral haemorrhage, patients spent significantly less time at home if they had a

356

documented diagnosis of myocardial infarction (18 versus 21 days), congestive heart failure

357

(17 versus 21 days), peripheral vascular disease (18 versus 21 days), renal disease (18 versus

358

21) and non-metastatic malignancy (17 versus 21 days). Patients with uncomplicated diabetes

359

spent more time at home (23 versus 20 days) (Supplementary Table 4). Patients with

360

subarachnoid haemorrhage spent significantly more time at home if they were married (32

361

versus 28 days) or if they had a previous stroke (40 versus 30 days) (p=0.02). The history of

362

renal disease and moderate or severe liver disease were associated with less home-time after

363

stroke (23 versus 31 days, p=0.03; 16 versus 31 days, p=0.03, respectively) (Supplementary

364

Table 5). There was significant variation in home-time estimates according to year of

365

admission for all sub-types, however, no clear linear association was evident.

366

4. Discussion

367

4.1 Main findings:

368

Home-time was reduced with increasing age, more severe disease and after intracerebral and

369

subarachnoid haemorrhage, all of which are known to adversely affect stroke outcome. Less

370

functional independence and greater comorbidity burden also reduced home-time. These

371

findings underscore the immediate adverse impact of stroke on people’s ability to live at

372

home after the event and provide further evidence that home-time serves as a useful proxy for

373

disability.

374

The large cohort afforded reliable insights into the impact of stroke in relatively young

375

patients of which there were 5,205 cases aged younger than 50 years. Younger patients with

376

intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage spent less time at home compared with patients

377

older than 75 after an ischaemic stroke. More than half of patients over the age 75 years after

378

haemorrhagic stroke and half of those older than 85 years after an ischaemic stroke did not

379

spend any time at home highlighting the considerable burden of stroke affecting elderly

380

members of the community.

381

Females with ischaemic stroke spent fewer days at home as reported elsewhere [11,36].

382

While sex differences either narrowed or did not persist in multivariate analyses accounting

383

for age, these findings demonstrate women’s vulnerability to poor outcomes due to their

384

relatively advanced age, consistent with results from gold-standard incident stroke studies

385

[37]. Patients residing in areas of greater socio-economic disadvantage and single patients

386

with ischaemic stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage had lower home-time estimates. Socio-

387

demographic characteristics have also been associated with traditional stroke outcome

388

measures [38]. These results either implicate patient characteristics in post-stroke morbidity

389

or, alternatively, indicate that home-time measures constructs other than disability. For

390

example, socio-demographic variables, may mediate their accessibility to health services

391

post-stroke.

392

These findings inform the validity of the composite surrogate severity measure incorporating

393

GCS and mode of arrival. The association between GCS and home-time was strongest for

394

subarachnoid haemorrhage corroborating GCS as a valid component of standardised severity

395

measures for this sub-type [27]. The correlation between GCS and home-time attenuated

396

when in-patient deaths were removed from the cohort consistent with patterns of correlations

397

reported when using gold-standard stroke severity assessment [14].

398

Previous results demonstrate that home-time correlates with the modified Rankin Scale or the

399

Barthel Index [11-15,36,39]. Here, we demonstrate a strong correlation with another measure

400

of functional status, the FIM, adding weight to the construct validity of home-time. Total

401

FIM and motor subscale scores were strongly associated with home-time, while the

402

correlation between cognitive subscale scores and days spent at home was more moderate.

22
403

Home-time may therefore underestimate disability due to cognitive deficits, a shortcoming

404

shared with traditional stroke outcome measures, such as the modified Rankin Scale score

405

[40].

406

4.2 Comparison with previous work: Two other population-based studies have published

407

home-time estimates [11,14]. A nation-wide Scottish study of over 101,000 patients defined

408

home-time as we have done and reported estimates comparable to those observed here [14].

409

Home-time was not reported separately for haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke and the gold-

410

standard NIHSS severity measure was ascertained in around 5% of cases. Standardised

411

outcome measures were unavailable. Another study identified ~15,000 stroke cases

412

representing all subtypes as here and counted overnight hospital stays only [11]. Validation of

413

home-time was carried out for 552 patients with ischaemic stroke for whom the modified

414

Rankin Scale scores were available.

415

In a multi-centre study of 1,866 subarachnoid haemorrhage patients with gold-standard case

416

ascertainment, readmission data were not available [12]. Home-time strongly correlated with

417

the modified Rankin Scale. Our results strengthen evidence for the validity of home-time in

418

subarachnoid haemorrhage with more robust home-time assessment.

419

4.3 Strengths and limitations: Strengths include cost-effective, near universal home-time

420

and proxy severity ascertainment, and population-based validation of home-time against

421

baseline and outcome measures for all stroke sub-types with granular reporting of home-time

422

by patient characteristics. Another strength was the capacity to capture same-day admissions

423

including out-patient rehabilitation offered by hospitals and short-stay admissions as ignoring

424

these admissions will artificially inflate home-time for patients with residual, ongoing

425

disability.

23
426

Coding inaccuracy is a potential limitation although accuracy is often high [21]. As

427

previously discussed [18], stroke coding in Australia has been validated in several studies

428

showing high levels of accuracy in terms of positive predictive value, inter-rater coder

429

reliability and sensitivity. Comorbidities are only coded if these require treatment in hospital

430

and therefore it is likely comorbidities were under-numerated, although applying a look-back

431

period reduces under-numeration [41]. The apparent protective effects of stroke history in

432

subarachnoid haemorrhage and uncomplicated diabetes in intracerebral haemorrhage may

433

reflect less severe aetiology (for example, non-aneurysmal aetiology for subarachnoid

434

haemorrhage) or differential ascertainment of comorbidities in patients with dissimilar

435

prognoses. Specifically, under-ascertainment may be more likely in patients who die within

436

hours of admission or who are acutely unwell as the management of chronic comorbidities is

437

not central to the care of critically ill patients. In contrast, comorbidities are relevant to

438

relatively well patients and may be preferentially recorded in surviving patients.

439

FIM scores were obtained from in-patient rehabilitation records for the sub-group of patients

440

receiving publicly funded rehabilitation who, by definition, had disability. These results may

441

not generalise to patients undergoing rehabilitation as an outpatient or at private facilities.

442

Home-time was not calculated for the 4.2% of patients either residing or transferred interstate

443

or for those with missing hospitalisation data, and the impact of this source of missing data

444

could not be assessed here. Anticipated national data linkage may eliminate shortcomings

445

associated with cross-jurisdictional patient flows [42] while improved data quality will

446

mitigate against data loss. We could not identify cases entering residential care who later

447

returned to a private residence or patients admitted to supported care facilities after discharge

448

to home, although the short 90-day follow-up period may have minimised such

449

misclassification. We did not assess stroke severity using gold-standard measures as these are

450

not available using administrative data, although the GCS is integral to measuring severity in

subarachnoid haemorrhage [27] and is strongly predictive of mortality for ischaemic stoke

452

[19, 26] and intracerebral haemorrhage [26].

453

Loss of consciousness may be an inexact proxy for severity. Very low GCS at first point of

454

contact may indicate temporary loss of consciousness due to syncope or seizure, rather than

455

stroke severity. This may account for the higher home-time estimates observed in

456

haemorrhagic stroke patients – only in those surviving their admission – whose initial GCS

457

scores fell within the most severe range compared with those whose scores were within the

458

penultimate severity category. While GCS and mode of arrival predict mortality after stroke,

459

the GCS is a weaker correlate of home-time than the National Institutes of Health Stroke

460

Scale (NIHSS) [14], likely reflecting its less sensitive assessment of neurological deficits.

461

4.4 Implications for future research: Definitions of home-time have been adapted to suit

462

the scope of administrative data sources at hand. For example, here and previously [14],

463

home-time was defined as the number of full days not spent in hospital while others have

464

calculated home-time as the number of nights spent at home [11]. Where available,

465

residential care data provide reliable information about supportive care arrangements [11]

466

whereas we and others [14] relied on hospital disposition coding to identify residential care

467

admissions. Efforts are needed to harmonise the definition of home-time to aid multicentre

468

and multinational studies and comparisons.

469

As noted by others [15], home-time may not accurately reflect disability for patients who

470

receive assistance in their private residence nor does it differentiate between patients

471

according to the level of support required in residential care. Patients discharged home who

472

then die during the follow-up period may have equivalent home-time values as those who

473

survive to 90-days with lengthy in-hospital stays. Further, discharge to nursing home care,

474

death during the stroke admission and hospitalisation for the entire follow-up period yield

475

equivalent home-time estimates of zero days. Whether the validity of home-time can be

476

improved by adding qualitative information to achieve a more nuanced disability measure

477

merits future research. Large differences in median values between the main cohort and the

478

sub-set of patients surviving their stroke admission highlights the sizeable influence deaths

479

have on home-time estimates. For this reason, we and others report descriptive analyses

480

excluding in-patient deaths.

481

4.5 Conclusion: In conclusion, these findings support home-time ascertained using

482

administrative data as a robust, inexpensive, replicable and valid patient-centred outcome that

483

facilitates population-based stroke surveillance.
