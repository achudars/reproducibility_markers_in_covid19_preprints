Abstract

2

Current research implicates pre- and probiotic supplementation as potential mediators for

3

improving symptomology in numerous physical and emotional ailments. The alteration of

4

emotional states via nutrient intake is an attractive concept for clinicians and consumers

5

alike and may be an efficient channel to improved well-being. Here we focus on the period of

6

late adolescence, which is a time of emotional refinement via maturation that significantly

7

influences emotional, social and physical well-being in later years. Effective interventions

8

such as nutritional supplementation in this age group have the potential to offset health-

9

related costs in later life. In this study we examined multiple indices of mood and well-being

10

in 64 healthy females in late adolescence in a 4-week double blind, placebo controlled

11

Galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) prebiotic supplement intervention. We also obtained stool

12

samples at baseline and follow-up for microbiome sequencing and analyses. We found

13

effects of the GOS intervention on sub-clinical self-reported high trait anxiety, attentional

14

bias, and bacterial abundance, suggesting that dietary supplementation with a GOS prebiotic

15

may be influential in improving indices of pre-clinical anxiety.

Introduction

2

In recent years, the gut microbiome has emerged as an important player in our efforts to

3

understand the factors that influence brain function and behaviour1–4. The gut and the brain

4

are intimately connected via the gut-brain axis, which involves bidirectional communication

5

via neural, endocrine and immune pathways5–7. For example, gut microbial composition —

6

which itself alters throughout the lifespan and in response to factors such as stress and

7

lifestyle choices including diet8 — has been shown to regulate gene expression and the

8

release of metabolites in the brain9,10. There are also suggestions that a significant reduction

9

in microbial diversity, or an increased number of pathogenic microbes, affects brain-

10

behaviour relationships, and may lead to psychological abnormalities that underlie mental

11

illness11. To date, studies in humans have focused on characterising microbe populations in

12

both health and disease4,12. In adults for example, the gut microbiota has been shown to be

13

related to atypical social functioning in autism13 and symptoms of anxiety and depression7,14.

14

Animal research has suggested that the gut microbiota plays an important role during key

15

moments in the host development, and in particular during adolescence which represents a

16

critical time window where microbiota help fine-tune the gut-brain axis3,8,15. One of the

17

consequences gut microbiota variations during neurodevelopment is that it may lead to

18

aberrant brain network maturation and thus atypical behavioural patterns. This supposition

19

highlights the importance of understanding how changes in the gut microbiome relate to

20

brain function and plasticity during this critical developmental period16.

21

Animal research has highlighted the significant impact of the gut microbiota on the

22

development and maturation of brain networks that underlie emotion15–17. Particularly,

23

nutritional interventions have been shown to fortify the microbiome-gut-brain axis and

24

ameliorate microbial imbalances such as dysbiosis. Drastic changes in diet can alter

25

microbial diversity in a matter of days18, and research also suggests that modifying microbial

26

ecology via the intake of so-called ‘psychobiotics’ could help reduce stress responses and

27

symptoms of anxiety and depression19–21. The term psychobiotics refers to live cultures of

beneficial gut bacteria (probiotics) or substrates which enhance the growth and/or activity of

2

indigenous beneficial intestinal bacteria (prebiotics), which when ingested in sufficient

3

amounts improve brain function22,23. Probiotic strains, including members of the genera

4

Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, are enriched in some dairy/fermented products, whereas

5

prebiotics are non-digestible substances that feed the gut microbiome18,24 such as fructans

6

and oligosaccharides found in in cereals, fruits and vegetables22. Both pro- and prebiotic

7

substances are commercially available as supplements. There is no doubt that the

8

administration of psychobiotics (both probiotics and prebiotics) to rodents leads to robust,

9

reproducible, attenuating effects on anxious and depressive-like behaviours, and suppress

10

the neuroendocrine stress response. However, the translatability of these psychotropic

11

actions to humans remains unclear.

12

A recent study in adult volunteers found that the consumption of probiotics in a randomised

13

double-blind trial, reduced measures of low mood and distress, and urinary free cortisol

14

which indicated a decreased stress response25. Similarly, a 4-week course of a multispecies

15

probiotic in healthy participants resulted in reduced responsiveness to sad mood26. A

16

neuroimaging investigation in female participants who had consumed a probiotic containing

17

yoghurt over 4 weeks, revealed differential signals over brain regions involved in emotion

18

processing and regulation27. The main problem of using probiotics is that introducing an

19

allochthonous probiotics species could disturb the cross-feeding microbiota population,

20

which is particularly disruptive in participants with weakened immune systems28. Prebiotics

21

on the other hand support the beneficial bacteria that are already present in the participants’

22

gut, such as Bifidobacterium which have been linked to emotional well-being25–27.

23

Intake of a galacto-oligosaccharides prebiotic over 4 weeks has also been shown to lower

24

the secretion of the stress hormone cortisol and emotional processing in healthy adults29 in

25

comparison to placebo. In the same study, participants exhibited decreased attentional

26

vigilance to negative information in a dot-probe task. Given that anxious people routinely

exhibit increased biases towards negative information30, this suggests that GOS intake may

2

be useful in modifying anxiety-related psychological mechanisms.

3

The main aim of the current study was to investigate whether GOS intake influences anxiety

4

and mood measures in late adolescence and early adulthood in humans. Specifically, we

5

used emotion regulation as a model for anxiety, as good emotion processing abilities in

6

development are linked with various indices of well-being and mental health31. Moreover, it

7

has been repeatedly shown that adolescence represents an important developmental

8

juncture for both the emergence of social fears31 and the development of emotion control

9

abilities, which allow the individual to control their fear responses and anxiety32. Here we

10

compared the effects of a 4-week course of GOS supplements compared to a placebo on

11

the gut-microbiome and emotional behaviour and well-being. Emotional behaviour was

12

assessed with the attentional dot-probe task 29 and a number of self-report measures of

13

anxiety33,34, depression35,36 and emotion regulation abilities37,38. In the current study we

14

hypothesised that daily intake of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) for 4 weeks would: 1)

15

reduce self-reported levels of anxiety in the GOS group in comparison to the placebo group;

16

2) improve attentional bias towards positive emotional stimuli in the dot-probe task, and 3)

17

stimulate the fecal abundance of potently beneficial gut bacteria (such as Bifidobacterium) in

18

the GOS compared to the placebo group.

19

Materials and Methods

20

Participants. Sixty-four healthy late adolescent female volunteers were recruited to this

21

double-blind placebo-controlled 4-week galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) supplement

22

intervention study via posters and online advertisements. Inclusion criteria were no current

23

or previous clinical diagnoses of anxiety or co-morbid neurological, psychiatric,

24

gastrointestinal, or endocrine disorders; no current habitual use of prebiotic or probiotic

25

supplements; no antibiotic use in the 3 months prior to study enrolment and no vegan diets.

26

All participants provided written informed consent prior to testing and received financial

27

compensation for participating in the study.

1

Participants were screened for trait anxiety scores on the STAI-Trait subscale33 and

2

randomised with stratification for baseline anxiety to either GOS or placebo group based on

3

anxiety level (high or low, median split of sample scores at baseline). This study was given a

4

favourable opinion by the University of Surrey Ethics Committee (UEC/2017/086/FHMS),

5

and is registered on https://www.clinicaltrials.gov number NCT03835468.

6

Design. Power to detect statistically significant effects in behavioural measures was

7

determined to be sufficient with a sample size of 60 participants, posited on small effect

8

sizes found in similar research29. At both testing time points, baseline and follow-up, the

9

same testing protocol was used. Specifically, all participants completed a comprehensive

10

battery of self-report questionnaires (see materials for a description) assessing indices of

11

anxiety33,34, mood35,36, emotion regulation37,38 and sleep39. The self-reported trait anxiety

12

scores at baseline were used to group participants as high or low anxious based on the

13

median score of the sample collected. Participants also completed two subscales (verbal

14

and matrix reasoning) of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence40 to estimate IQ, as

15

well as the attentional dot-probe task to assess overt emotional processing29. Each

16

participant was also provided with a stool-sampling kit (MyMicroZoo, Leiden, The

17

Netherlands) to self-collect faeces for gut microbiome sequencing analysis. Following the

18

baseline assessment, participants were issued a 28-day supply of supplements (GOS or

19

placebo), which were to be taken once daily. To assess usual intake at the start of the study

20

and to monitor compliance with the dietary instructions (to consume the supplement and to

21

not change their usual diet) participants were also asked to complete a 4-day food estimated

22

diary at each time point which was reviewed by a member of the research team at their

23

testing appointments. The food diary is a semi-quantitative diary used routinely by our group,

24

which required participants to record their intake concurrently during the day in as much

25

detail as possible, including brand names, cooking methods and portion sizes. Diaries were

26

analysed using nutritional analysis software (Nutritics.com) for energy and macro- and

27

micronutrient intakes.

1

At follow-up, the entire testing protocol was repeated for each participant following cessation

2

of supplement supply (study duration Mdn = 30 days for both GOS group (range: 25-36

3

days) and placebo group (range: 27 - 43 days)), and participants provided a second stool

4

sample.

5

Self-report measures. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire obtaining

6

information on age, height, weight and relevant medical history. Following this, psychological

7

self-assessment questionnaires obtained indices of anxiety, mood and emotion regulation.

8

Anxiety assessments comprised measures of state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety

9

Inventory; STAI33) and social anxiety (Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents and Young

10

People; SAS-A34). Mood measures included measures of general mood (Mood and Feelings

11

Questionnaire: Short Version; MFQ36) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II; BDI-

12

II35). Emotion regulation was indexed using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for

13

Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA37) and Thought Control Ability Questionnaire (TCAQ38).

14

Finally, participants reported sleep quality for the preceding 1-month period using the

15

Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI39).

16

Attentional dot probe task. The attentional dot-probe task was adapted from Schmidt and

17

colleagues29 and presented E-Prime 3.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh,

18

PA) to assess emotional processing and biases to negative, positive and neutral word pairs

19

in masked and unmasked conditions. Negative and positive words induce emotional bias,

20

whereas neutral word words pairs act as fillers. Masked and unmasked conditions alter

21

awareness of stimulus emotional valence. At the beginning of each trial, a fixation cross

22

appeared on screen for 500 ms. This was followed with a word pair that was one of 30

23

positive-neutral, 30 negative-neutral and 30 neutral-neutral pairs, with words positioned at

24

the top and bottom of the screen. Emotional word position was equally split across top and

25

bottom. In the masked condition (90 trials), word pairs were presented for 17 ms, followed by

26

a length and position matched mask of a nonsense letter string for 483 ms. In the unmasked

27

condition (90 trials), word pairs were presented for 500 ms. This was followed by a probe of

either one or two stars, that was congruent or incongruent with the emotional word position.

2

The participant responded by pressing either ‘1’ or ‘2’ corresponding to the number of stars

3

in the probe, terminating the trial. Frequency of number of stars and of position was equally

4

split across all trials. A total of 180 trials were presented and randomised across masked

5

and unmasked conditions, and valence stimulus pairs. Attentional vigilance was calculated

6

from the response times of correct responses by subtracting congruent RT from incongruent

7

RTs for positive and negative stimuli in masked and unmasked conditions separately. E-

8

Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to present experimental

9

stimuli.

10

GOS/placebo supplement. Participants received either a daily dose of 7 grams of the

11

prebiotic galacto-oliogosaccharides (GOS) provided by FrieslandCampina, Amersfoort, The

12

Netherlands; or a placebo (maltodextrin, dried glucose syrup) for a period of 28 days. GOS

13

are non-digestible carbohydrates, which are not completely broken down by human digestive

14

enzymes. Because of this, they reach the intestine relatively intact, where they are then

15

available for the present microbiota23 whereas Maltodextrin is absorbed in the upper part of

16

the intestine and does not reach the colon. Both supplements were provided in powdered

17

form in unlabelled packaging and are similar in colour and taste. Supplements were

18

instructed to be consumed by mixing with food or drink once daily.

19

Stool sampling. At baseline and follow-up participants were provided with a unique sampling

20

kit provided by MyMicroZoo (Leiden, the Netherlands) for stool collection at home. Feces

21

samples were collected in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, CA, USA) and returned by the

22

subjects to the recruitment station where collected samples were returned and stored at -

23

80°C prior to being shipped on dry-ice for analysis by MyMicroZoo.

24

DNA extraction. DNA extraction was performed using the Quick-DNA™ Fecal/Soil Microbe

25

Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s instructions except for using the

26

fecal slurry, containing DNA/RNA Shield, as input during bead beating for mechanical cell

27

lysis instead of using the lysis buffer provided in the extraction kit.

16S rRNA gene based bacterial profiling. Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries were

2

generated and sequenced at BaseClear (Leiden, the Netherlands). In short, barcoded

3

amplicons from the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA genes were generated using a 2-step PCR.

4

10 genomic (g)DNA was used as template for the first PCR with a total volume of 50 ul using

5

the 341F (5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3’) and the 785R (5’-

6

GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’) primers appended with Illumina adaptor sequences.

7

PCR products were purified, and the size of the PCR products were checked on

8

Fragmentanalyzer (Advanced Analytical, CA, USA) and quantified by fluorometric analysis.

9

Purified PCR products were used for the 2nd PCR in combination with sample-specific

10

barcoded primers (Nextera XT index kit; Illumina, CA, Illumina). Subsequently, PCR

11

products were purified, checked on a Fragment analyser and quantified, followed by

12

multiplexing, clustering, and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq with the paired-end (2x) 300

13

bp protocol and indexing. The sequencing run was analysed with the Illumina CASAVA

14

pipeline (v1.8.3) with demultiplexing based on sample-specific barcodes. The raw

15

sequencing data produced was processed removing the sequence reads of too low quality

16

(only "passing filter" reads were selected) and discarding reads containing adaptor

17

sequences or PhiX control with an in-house filtering protocol. A quality assessment on the

18

remaining reads was performed using the FASTQC quality control tool version 0.10.0. The

19

Illumina paired reads were merged into single reads (so-called pseudoreads) through

20

sequence overlap, after removal of the forward and reverse primers. Chimeric pseudoreads

21

were removed using USEARCH 9.241 and the remaining reads were aligned to the RDP

22

16S rRNA gene database42. Based on the alignment scores of the pseudoreads, the

23

taxonomic depth of the lineage is based on the identity threshold of the rank; Species 99%,

24

Genus 97%, Family 95%, Order 90%, Class 85%, Phylum 80%. Illumina reads were

25

deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) in

26

fastq-format under study accession number PRJEB32693 (or secondary accession number

microbiota diversity, was calculated using USEARCH 9.241 with OTU clustering with a

2

sequencing identity threshold of 97% after subsampling from the entire set, to account for

3

different sampling depths.

4

Multivariate analysis. Partial Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed using the rda-

5

function in the Vegan-package (version 2.5-443) in R (version 3.3.1) to assess correlations

6

between 16S rRNA gene based bacterial composition data (at the genus level) and the GOS

7

treatment at baseline versus follow-up (as environmental variable), after conditioning the

8

data for the covariate ‘subject’. RDA can be considered a constrained version of Principal

9

Component Analysis (PCA). Where PCA considers all variance encompassed in the data,

10

RDA only considers variance explained by the environmental variables (in this case time,

11

contrasting baseline versus follow-up). The psychological response variables SAS, STAI

12

Trait, STAI state, MFQ, BDI from the self-report measures, and positive and negative bias

13

from attentional vigilance calculations in the dot probe task were fitted onto the ordination. In

14

the resulting biplot, a type 1 (object focused) scaling is employed so that the scores for

15

samples are scaled by eigenvalues and that when plotted, the distances between them

16

represent their similarity (Euclidean distances).

17

Statistical analysis

18

Self-report measures obtained at follow-up were compared using analysis of covariance

19

(ANCOVAs) between intervention groups (GOS and placebo) and anxiety grouping (High

20

and Low) considering baseline measures as a covariate. Baseline measures were initially

21

tested for differences between intervention groups prior to using ANCOVAs. Similarly,

22

attentional dot-probe outcomes at follow-up were assessed for attentional vigilance to

23

positive and negative stimuli in the masked and unmasked conditions using ANCOVAs

24

between intervention and anxiety groups with baseline measures as a covariate. Bacterial

25

diversity at follow up was also evaluated with ANCOVA examining intervention and anxiety

26

groups. Bacterial abundance of all genera was evaluated using non-parametric calculations

treatment and was indicated in the RDA diagrams. Statistical testing was performed in R

(version 3.5.144).

Results

6

A 25% attrition rate resulted in 48 participants completing the study, n = 23 in the GOS

7

group (high anxiety n = 12, low anxiety n = 11) and n = 25 in the placebo group (high anxiety

8

n = 13, low anxiety n = 12), matched for age (GOS median (Mdn) = 19 years (range: 18-25),

9

placebo Mdn = 20 years (range: 18-25)), IQ (GOS Mdn = 103 (83-148), placebo Mdn = 102

10

(72-125)) and BMI (GOS Mdn = 20.5 kg/m2 (range: 18.8-30.1), placebo = Mdn 20.3 kg/m2

11

(range: 16.2 – 27.2)). Diets were consistent across time for each supplement group for total

12

energy consumption, although the GOS group had lower overall energy intake than placebo

13

at both baseline (p = .009) and follow up (p = .025). At the macro level, consumption was

14

estimated as a percentage of energy intake for each individual over the first (baseline) and

15

last (follow up) four-day period of supplement intake. Between GOS and placebo groups,

16

non-parametric tests showed no significant difference for carbohydrate, fat, protein, dietary

17

saturated fat, sugars or alcohol intake. From baseline to follow up paired sample non-

18

parametric tests showed no difference in any of the aforementioned measures in the placebo

19

group, but the GOS group demonstrated a reduction in sugar consumption at follow up (p =

20

.010), with all other measures remaining consistent (Supplementary table 1).

21

Self-report measures. For all measures, models comparing baseline scores confirmed no

22

differences between groups thus ANCOVA was used to compare group means at follow-up

23

(Table 1). The significant interaction of intervention and anxiety grouping on trait anxiety

24

scores F(1,42) = 5.58, p = .023, n2 = .03 was followed up with further ANCOVAs examining

25

the influence of intervention for anxiety grouping independently. It was found that compared

26

to the placebo group, four weeks of GOS consumption reduced self-reported scores for high

27

15

follow-up, M = 8.0, SE = 1.4; p = 0.989 (Figure 3). Other significant changes across time in

Discussion

2

In this double-blind placebo-controlled 4-week galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) supplement

3

intervention study we sought to characterise the influence of GOS on indices of emotional

4

well-being and microbial gut composition in a sample of female participants towards the end

5

of adolescence. We found anxiolytic effects of GOS in high anxious participants in self-

6

reported trait anxiety and trends towards reduced negative emotional bias and increased

7

positive bias in the dot-probe task. Additionally, microbial composition was characterised by

8

increased Bifidobacterium abundances at follow up in the GOS group. RDA analysis of

9

microbial composition against psychological measures found trend level separation of

10

bacterial composition in high anxious females at follow up compared to baseline. Altogether,

11

these data indicate that GOS supplementation raises fecal abundances of Bifidobacterium

12

and has an anxiolytic influence on emotional wellbeing in high anxious late adolescent

13

females.

14

The anxiolytic effects evident in this intervention are in line with a prior community study of

15

GOS whereby stress indicators were reduced and emotional behaviour improved following 3

16

weeks of GOS supplementation29, adding corroborative evidence to the literature that GOS

17

supplementation assists in functional enhancement of biological networks underpinning

18

emotion regulation and mood. Anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of multispec pre- and

19

probiotics are apparent in several in-human studies e.g.

20

study elucidated no demonstrable impact of GOS on measures of mood, depression,

21

emotion regulation or indeed social or state reported anxiety levels. Some clinical trials have

22

linked pro- or prebiotic intake to reduced depression26 or anxiety46,47, others have found no

23

support48–50. In these trials, measures of depression and anxiety are usually secondary to

24

primary outcomes in overall improvement in clinical conditions51 and are comorbid in the

25

function of existing dysregulated biological systems (e.g. IBS46,47, rheumatoid arthritis52,

26

fibromyalgia48). The finding that GOS only impacts self-reported sub-clinical trait anxiety in

25–27,29,45

, however, results of this

1

this study suggests a dimension of sensitivity in late adolescent females that would benefit

2

from further exploration.

3

Trait anxiety is a persistent emotional state characterised by doubts, fear and worry. When

4

such a state co-occurs with the final period of maturation in late adolescents, emotion

5

regulation ability is key for determining the trajectory for lifelong behaviours53. Animal models

6

have shown that dysbiosis in adolescence results in lasting effects on brain-behaviour

7

interactions8,15. While gut-microbiota-brain (GMB) influences are bidirectional, biological

8

systems may be fine-tuned via nutritional intake. This may benefit late adolescence females,

especially those subject to transient suboptimal emotional regulation skills in the final stages

10

of maturation (e.g. displaying symptoms of stress and anxiety). Nutritional supplementation

11

and consequential influence on GMB may prove effective in stabilising some of these

12

symptoms in this age group. Probiotics are known to influence the gut-brain axis via

13

endocrine, immune and neural pathways27,54,55. For example, Lactobacillus rhamnosus

14

intake exerts influence on GABA receptors in the brain54, which cooperates with excitatory

15

glutamate to regulate brain function. Glutamate and GABA are respectively excitatory and

16

inhibitory neurotransmitters that are essential in typical cognitive development56. In anxious

17

individuals, disruption to the balance of this relationship is correlated with poorer cognitive

18

control57 and influences emotion regulation ability. The intake of pre- and probiotics may

19

contribute to the harmonisation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance.

20

We affirmed a clear influence of GOS intake on Bifidobacterium increase across time in

21

comparison to placebo group. Data are also suggestive of a decrease in potential

22

pathogens. While measures of microbiota diversity are similar across groups and time, it

23

may be that GOS intake resulted in the prevention of potentially unhealthy bacteria, offering

24

protective benefits. Admittedly, it is difficult to disentangle if the influence of GOS observed

25

in these data is due to the stimulation of Bifidobacterium growth, or the reduction in

26

proteobacteria. Naturally, diet is likely a key component of this relationship and in this

27

sample, we found little support for dietary changes in groups across time, excepting reduced

1

sugar intake in the GOS group, or between groups. This strengthens the hypothesis that

2

GOS exerts beneficial influence on well-being, yet the mechanisms of this require further

3

investigation. Regardless, the subtle fine tuning of microbiota with GOS intake may be

4

enough to assist in the biological regulation of emotional pathways and contribute to

5

improved well-being in pre-clinical populations.

6

Of note in the outcome of this study is the relatively small effect sizes and trend level p-

7

values of our self-report psychological measures and dot probe task. The dot-probe task

8

encapsulates attentional biases to emotional stimuli. Prevalent, heightened anxiety

9

commonly results in attentional bias to negative, or threating information30, and can be

10

reduced by attentional bias modification training58. Attentional training works to modify

11

emotion regulation networks in the brain59 however, there are questions surrounding the

12

consistency of the manifestation of attentional biases at the individual level59. In the absence

13

of attentional bias training, results from the dot probe task were indicative of trends towards

14

reduced negative bias and increased positive bias to emotional stimuli in the high anxious

15

GOS group, a pattern that was also observed in the low-anxious placebo group. While this

16

may indicate that high anxious GOS participants have undergone alterations in cognitive-

17

emotional processing compared to the high anxious placebo group, it is difficult to cleanly

18

interpret as the low anxious GOS group results do not mirror their placebo counterparts.

19

Although there are trends towards interventional effects, individual variability in anxiety

20

expression within intervention groups may be influenced by variables not accounted for in

21

this study.

22

Similar community sample research produce equally small effect sizes on comparative

23

measures29. This might be anticipated in an intervention in sub-clinical typical populations

24

examining factors at group level where specific pathways and mechanisms are yet to be fully

25

established. Well defined operational measures with strong correlations to mediating

26

pathways as exhibited in animal studies may result in more targeted therapeutic potential of

27

GOS in humans. Herein, GOS has been established to increase Bifidobacterium abundance
