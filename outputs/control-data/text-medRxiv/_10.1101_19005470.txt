Abstract
Background: There is limited information on the volume of influenza-associated
mortality in Russia.
Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al., Epidemiology
2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory causes, circulatory
causes, and for certain infectious and parasitic diseases (available from the Russian
Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)) linearly against the monthly proxies for the
incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the
Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) on levels of ILI/ARI consultations and
the percent of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and
B), adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation
and temporal trends.
Results: For the 2010/11 through the 2014/15 seasons, influenza circulation was
associated with an average annual 11106 (95% CI (4321,17892)) deaths for circulatory
causes, 4552 (3744,5360) deaths for respiratory causes, and 343 (63,624) deaths for
certain infectious and parasitic diseases, with influenza A/H3N2 being responsible for
the majority of influenza-associated respiratory deaths and influenza B making a
substantial contribution to influenza-associated mortality for circulatory causes.

Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality burden in
Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths. Those results support the potential utility of
influenza vaccination (with the role played by influenza B in circulatory mortality
pointing to the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines), as well as of administration
of antiviral drugs for high-risk individuals during periods of active influenza circulation.

Introduction
Annual epidemics associated with the circulation of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B
take place in Russia [1]. Such epidemics are known to result in a substantial toll of
mortality in other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, e.g. [2-7], including mortality
for circulatory causes [2,3], with influenza additionally known to be associated with a
variety of cardiovascular manifestations [8]. At the same time, there is limited
information on the national burden of influenza-associated mortality in Russia.
Estimates of the rates of influenza-associated mortality in Russia for select influenza
seasons exist on a regional level, particularly for the city of St. Petersburg [9]. At the
same time, the rates of influenza-associated mortality vary both spatially, as well as
year-to-year. For example, while influenza A, particularly influenza A/H3N2 is known to
be a major source of excess mortality [10], the 2017/18 season in Europe saw high
levels of excess mortality associated with the circulation of influenza B/Yamagata
strains [11], with those strains not being included in trivalent influenza vaccines.
Additionally, the overall rates of death for circulatory diseases in Russia are high [12],
and there is evidence that influenza B plays an important role in influenza-associated
circulatory mortality, e.g. [13], as well as Table 3 in [2] (comparison of regression
coefficients for circulatory vs. respiratory mortality). It is important therefor to consider
national data from a number of influenza seasons to address the uncertainty regarding
the national burden of mortality associated with the circulation of the major influenza
(sub)types (A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B) in Russia for different causes of death, including
respiratory and circulatory diseases. Such estimates are important for planning

mitigation efforts, including vaccination and administration of antiviral medications to
certain population groups during active circulation of the different influenza (sub)types.
In our earlier work [2,3,14], we introduced a new method for estimating the burden of
severe outcomes associated with influenza and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
designed to address several limitations of some of the previously employed inference
models. An important feature of that approach is the use of RSV and influenza A/H3N2,
A/H1N1, and B incidence proxies that are expected to be linearly related to the
population incidence of those viruses; such proxies for influenza (sub)types combine
data on medical consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) with data on the testing of
respiratory specimens from symptomatic individuals [2,3,7]. We’ve applied those
incidence proxies to estimate the rates of influenza-associated mortality stratified by
age/cause of death in the US [2,3], with the corresponding method being later adopted
for the estimation of influenza-associated mortality in other countries as well, e.g. [5-7].
In this paper, we derive the analogous proxies for the weekly/monthly incidence of
influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and B in Russia based on the surveillance data from the
Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) [15]. We then apply the inference
model from [2,3,14] to relate those incidence proxies to the monthly data from the
Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) [16] on the rates of death for
respiratory causes, circulatory causes, and deaths for certain infectious and parasitic
diseases to estimate the corresponding mortality rates associated with the circulation of
the major influenza (sub)types during the 2010/11 through the 2014/15 influenza
seasons in Russia.

Methods
Data
Monthly data on mortality for certain major causes of death in Russia are obtained from
[16]. We’ll concentrate on respiratory deaths, circulatory deaths, and deaths for certain
infectious and parasitic diseases (with about 60% of the latter deaths in 2018 being HIV-

related, and another 25% being TB-related, [12]). Influenza is known to be associated
with mortality for other causes as well, including neoplasms and metabolic diseases
[2,9]; however finer (e.g. weekly) mortality data are needed to ascertain the signals from
influenza circulation in the corresponding time series.
Weekly data on the rates of ILI/ARI consultation per 10,000 individuals in Russia are
available from [15] (with some of the data during the study period missing in [15] and
can be found in the Russian language version of the Smorodintsev Institute Surveillance
database [17]). Refs. [15,17] also contain the weekly data on the percent of respiratory
specimens from symptomatic individuals that were RT-PCR positive for influenza
A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and influenza B.
Inference method
Only a fraction of individuals presenting with ILI/ARI symptoms are infected with
influenza. We multiplied the weekly rates of ILI/ARI consultation per 10,000 individuals
[15,17] by the weekly percentages of respiratory specimens from symptomatic
individuals that were RT-PCR positive for each of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B
[15,17] to estimate the weekly incidence proxies for each of the corresponding influenza
(sub)types:
Weekly influenza (sub)type incidence proxy =

(1)

= Rate of consultations for ILI/ARI * % All respiratory specimens that were positive for the
(sub)type
As noted in [2], those proxies are expected to be proportional to the weekly population
incidence for the each of the major influenza (sub)types (hence the name “proxy”).
Monthly incidence proxies for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were obtained as the
weighted average of the weekly incidence proxies for those weeks that overlapped with
a given month; specifically, for each influenza (sub)type and month, the incidence proxy
for each week was multiplied by the number of days in that week that were part of the
corresponding month (e.g. 7 if the week was entirely within that month), then the

results were summed over the different weeks and divided by the number of days in the
corresponding month. Figure 1 plots the monthly incidence proxies (which are
estimated as daily averages over a month) for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B in
Russia between 09/2010 and 12/2015 (64 months), with that time period chosen for
inference purposes as we have information on both influenza surveillance and monthly
mortality during that period [15-17]. Figure 1 suggests a very large incidence proxy for
influenza A/H1N1 during the 2010/11 season. This may have to do with the fact that the
age distribution of cases for the 2010/11 A/H1N1 epidemic was different compared to
the subsequent A/H1N1 epidemics, and the ratio between the A/H1N1 incidence proxy
and the rates of A/H1N1-associated mortality is potentially different for the 2010/11
season compared to later seasons. Correspondingly, we split the A/H1N1 incidence
proxy into two (𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! for the 2010/11 season, and 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! for the later seasons).
Earlier work (e.g. [2]) suggests that there is a delay between one and two weeks
between influenza incidence and associated mortality. For the purposes of relating
influenza incidence to mortality we considered influenza incidence proxies shifted
forward by either 1 or 2 weeks, with the shifted monthly incidence proxies derived from
the shifted weekly incidence proxies in a manner described in the preceding paragraph.
For example, the incidence proxy for a given month shifted by 2 weeks is the weighted
average of the weekly incidence proxies for those weeks whose 2-week forward shift
overlaps with a given month. The choice of shifting the influenza incidence proxies by 1
week or 2 weeks in fitting the mortality data is determined by the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) scores similarly to other choices of parameters described below.
If 𝑀(𝑡) is the mortality rate for a given cause on month 𝑡 (with 𝑡 = 1 for 09/2010), and
𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2(𝑡), 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! (𝑡), 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! (𝑡), 𝐵(𝑡) are the shifted incidence proxies for the
major influenza (sub)types on month 𝑡 , then the inference model in [2,3] suggests that
𝑀 𝑡 = 𝛽! + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2(𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! (𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! (𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐵(𝑡) +

Here 𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 is the baseline rate of mortality not associated with influenza circulation
that is periodic with yearly periodicity. To accommodate the baseline’s unknown shape,
we will model it as

Here 𝐽𝑎𝑛 is a variable equaling 1 for the month of January, 0 otherwise (see Supporting
Information). The reason for including this variable is that data suggest bumps in
mortality in January, even under low influenza circulation/ ILI/ARI rates (particularly
for the 2012/13 season). Such bumps (also seen for the 2007/08 season under low
influenza circulation) are likely explained by cold weather [6] (with the January effect on
circulatory mortality in Russia examined in [18]), and possibly by the circulation of
other respiratory viruses. The (temporal) trend is modeled as a low degree polynomial
in time, or time periods, as explained below, with explicit model equations for
respiratory mortality, circulatory mortality and mortality for certain infectious and
parasitic diseases presented further down in this section.
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is adopted to select the variables (covariates) in
the model for each mortality cause, with the variable whose omission results in the
largest decline in the AIC score being dropped at each step until no omissions of a
variable decrease the AIC score. The model equations for respiratory mortality,
circulatory mortality and mortality due to certain infectious and parasitic diseases are as
follows:
Respiratory mortality. While there is no obvious long-term trend in respiratory mortality
in Figure 2, clearly there are seasonal fluctuations not related to influenza circulation,
and those are likely related to the circulation of other respiratory viruses. We will
accommodate those seasonal effects by modeling the temporal trend as a function of a

season, where the season for the circulation of other respiratory viruses is modeled to
run from July to June. Let 𝑇𝑠1 be a linear function of the season (equaling 1 for the
months of 09/2010 through 06/2011, to 2 for 07/2011 through 06/2012 etc.),
𝑇𝑠2 = 𝑇𝑠1! , 𝑇𝑠3 = 𝑇𝑠1! , etc. are the powers in 𝑇𝑠1. Then the model equation for
respiratory mortality selected using the AIC criterion is:
𝑀!"#$ 𝑡 = 𝛽! + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2(𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! 𝑡 + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! 𝑡 + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐵 𝑡 +

sense that removing each of them increases the AIC score of the model.
Circulatory mortality and mortality due to certain infectious and parasitic diseases. Figure
2 suggests that there is a continuous downward trend in those two mortality time series.
Therefor, we model the trend as a low degree polynomial in the month 𝑡, not the season
(with that choice justified not only by the visual inspection of Figure 2 but also by the
AIC criterion). The model equations selected by the AIC criterion are:

We note that a number of terms for the different influenza (sub)types are omitted by the
AIC criterion for the mortality causes in eqns. (4,5). Compared to respiratory mortality,
those omissions might be related to the fact that the relative effect of influenza
circulation on mortality is higher for respiratory deaths compared to the other
categories of deaths; correspondingly, the effects of circulation of each influenza

(sub)type on the monthly mortality are mixed with the relatively larger fluctuations in
the monthly mortality counts for non-respiratory categories compared to the
respiratory categories, resulting in potential lack of ascertainability as expressed by the
(lack of) justification of including those covariates via the AIC score. We also note in that
regard that it is visually clear that for example the incidence proxy for influenza A/H3N2
was growing towards its peak when circulatory mortality was declining for three out of
five seasons in the data, which may help explain its exclusion from the corresponding
model. Given the high correlation between the incidence proxies for the different
influenza (sub)types, omitting one (sub)type from the regression model affects the
regression coefficients for the other (sub)types. Thus models given by eqns. (4,5) are
meant to estimate the contribution of all influenza (sub)types, not only the ones
included to the corresponding mortality rates, though only as the average over the study
period (with annual estimates being less certain) – see also the Discussion regarding the
contribution of influenza A to circulatory mortality in Russia.

Results
Figure 1 plots the monthly incidence proxies for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B in
Russia between 09/2010 and 12/2015. Figure 2 plots the monthly rates of respiratory
deaths, circulatory deaths, and deaths for certain infectious and parasitic diseases
between 09/2010 and 12/2015. One sees that during seasons of high influenza
circulation (particularly the 2014/15 season that had the highest circulation of influenza
B and A/H3N2, Figure 1), the peak periods of each of the three mortality times series in
Figure 2 were largest; for the relatively smaller influenza seasons (2011/12 and
2013/14), peaks of the corresponding mortality time series were relatively smaller.

influenza-associated deaths in Russia (about 2.44-to-1 Table 2 vs. Table 1) is quite
higher that the corresponding estimate (about 1.35-to-1, [2]) for the US. At the same
time, the overall ratio of circulatory-to-respiratory deaths in Russia (about 14-to-1 in

2017, [19]).

Figures 4,5 plot the model fits for the rates of circulatory deaths, as well as deaths due to

consistent than for respiratory deaths (Figure 4 vs. 3). For example, the major
circulatory mortality peak during the 2012/13 season is not well-explained by the
model in eq. (4). At the same time, this peak might indeed largely be not influenzaassociated as it preceded the period of high influenza circulation as described by the
incidence proxies in Figure 1, and this also applies to an extent for the 2011/12 season –

Discussion
Influenza circulation is known to be associated with substantial mortality burden in the
Northern Hemisphere, e.g. [2-7]. At the same time, there is limited information on the
volume of influenza-related mortality in Russia, though some regional estimates,
particularly for the city of St. Petersburg are available [9]. In this paper, we applied the
previously developed methodology that was used to evaluate the rates of influenzaassociated mortality in several countries, e.g. [2,3,5-7] to estimate the rates of influenza-

associated mortality for three causes of death (respiratory causes, circulatory causes,
and certain infectious and parasitic diseases) for the period between the 2010/11
through the 2014/15 influenza seasons in Russia. We estimate about 16,001 annual
influenza-associated deaths for those three causes during that period, the majority of
which (about 11,106) are for circulatory causes, with influenza A/H3N2 being
responsible for the majority of influenza-associated respiratory deaths and influenza B
playing a substantial role in the influenza-associated circulatory mortality (see also
[13]). The prominence of circulatory deaths among influenza-associated mortality may
be related to the overall high rates of circulatory deaths in Russia [12]. We hope that this
work may help inform mitigation efforts. In particular, the role played by influenza B in
the circulatory mortality burden supports the potential benefit of quadrivalent influenza
vaccines (with trivalent influenza vaccines not containing the influenza B/Yamagata
strains that can be a source of high levels of excess mortality [10]). We also note in that
regard that the 2018/19 influenza season saw minimal circulation of influenza B in
Russia [15], raising the possibility of a major influenza B epidemic during the 2019/20
season, which further suppors the need for a quadrivalent influenza vaccine, particularly
for individuals with cardiac disease. Additionally, administration of antiviral
medications for certain population subgroups defined by age and presence of underlying
health conditions (particularly circulatory diseases) may help mitigate the burden of
severe outcomes during influenza epidemics in Russia.
Our study has some limitations. We only had access to monthly mortality data, with the
signal of influenza circulation in those data being mixed with other fluctuations of
relatively high magnitude, particularly for non-respiratory causes. While the model fits
for respiratory causes exhibited a good deal of temporal consistency, this wasn’t the case
for circulatory causes during certain seasons, particularly the 2012/13 season. While
earlier work, e.g. [13], as well as Table 3 in [2] (comparison of regression coefficients for
circulatory vs. respiratory deaths) also supports the important role played by influenza
B in circulatory influenza-associated mortality, there is uncertainty regarding our
estimates of the contribution of influenza A to circulatory mortality. It might be that our
model had missed some of the contribution of influenza, particularly influenza A to

mortality, especially circulatory mortality, with the circulatory mortality peaks during
the 2012/13 season potentially being related to influenza A infections contrary to the
model’s results (Figure 4). At the same time, other factors might have affected this peak
in circulatory mortality. Indeed, for the 2012/13 season, the peak of circulatory
mortality preceded the peak periods of both influenza circulation and ILI/ARI rates.
Moreover, the peak of respiratory mortality was broader than the peak of circulatory
mortality during that season (Figure 2), with the later part of that peak in respiratory
mortality explained well by influenza circulation (Figure 3), and the earlier part,
matching temporally the peak in circulatory mortality (Figure 2), not being explained by
influenza circulation (Figure 3). It may be that cold weather [6], and possibly the
circulation of other respiratory viruses have affected both the respiratory and
circulatory mortality during the 2012/13 season. We also note the major peak in both
circulatory and respiratory mortality in January, 2008 that couldn’t be explained by
influenza circulation (Figures 1 and 4 in [1]). Further work involving more granular
data, including climatic data [18], weekly mortality data, as well as data stratified by age
is needed to better understand “excess mortality” and the contribution of influenza to
the mortality rates in Russia, particularly the contribution of influenza A to circulatory
mortality.
We believe that despite those limitations, this work provides a national study of
influenza-related mortality in Russia, giving evidence for the substantial burden of
influenza-associated mortality, particularly for circulatory causes, and the contribution
of influenza B to the volume of influenza-associated mortality. We hope that this work
would stimulate further efforts involving more granular data (in particular, weekly
mortality data, as well as data stratified by age) to better understand the effect of
influenza epidemics in Russia on mortality and help inform mitigation efforts for certain
population subgroups.

death during the 2010-2011 through the 2014-2015 influenza seasons in Russia
Here, we examine the results of the inference model when the variable for the January
effect of mortality is not included. Below are the equations for the models (selected by
the AIC criterion) for respiratory mortality, circulatory mortality, and mortality for
certain infectious and parasitic diseases (compare with eqns. 3-5):
Respiratory: 𝑀!"#$ 𝑡 = 𝛽! + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2(𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! (𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1! (𝑡) +

Table S1 summarizes the comparison for the models with and without the January effect
in terms of the AIC score, R-squared statistic, and estimated average annual numbers of
influenza-associated deaths. One sees significant improvement in the model fits for
respiratory and circulatory deaths with the inclusion of the January effect – see also [S1].
